The coating was so thick that the tuna didn't cook fast enough (and I was going for rare) so the peas just ended up burning--which wouldn't have been so bad except then the wasabi taste was lost. Maybe I misunderstood the recipe--\"crushed\" to me means there are still some chunks in the mix. I think it would have been better to toss the peas into a food processor and grind them to a bread-crumb texture. I'll try it that way next time.",

Next time I will only buy 1/4 of a pound. (I can buy them in bulk at a local market) I used a food processor to crush the peas. I had a hard time with the coating; a lot of it stuck to the pan and some of it burned. Luckily my husband likes that burnt flavor. After the steaks were cooked I sprinkled some of the unused crushed peas over the steaks to bring back some of that wasabi kick. The sauce was delicious. I didn't have any saki so I used Chinese rice wine. This was all-in-all a terrific way to cook tuna. My husband loved it. He has spent some time in Japan and really enjoyed the flavors. I will definately make this again.",

And instead of breading the tuna with the crumbs I just sprinkled some on the top instead of baking. Even though I ground them there were a few pea chunks that were like little pieces of gravel when you bit into them. I also didn't care for the flavor of the marinade and it's due to the Chinese 5 spice powder. The cinnamon in the powder is overpowering for the tuna in my opinion. I love tuna but next time I will stick to the sesame seed coated method. It's always fun trying new things though and we still ate these tuna steaks. But we won't make them this way again.",
