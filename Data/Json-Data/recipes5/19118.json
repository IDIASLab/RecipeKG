I think I'd sweeten it up a bit and add less soy sauce and more chiles next time but that is just a matter of personal taste. What I hate about EVERY peanut sauce recipe I try is the reliance on peanut butter!!! The sauces you get in really good thai restaurants don't have that same waxy/silky texture that the peanut butter produces but I simply cannot find a peanut sauce recipe without it!! Maybe time to create my own (and then post it!)",

There is definitely too much sauce for this amount of chicken I suggest making only 1/3. (I'll be freezing the left over though; it just too good to throw away!) I also suggest tasting your sauce and adding whichever ingredient you feel is lacking. Finally I processed my onions to get that 'minced' requirement and it worked like a bomb!",

I broiled the chicken strips instead of grilling because my grill-master wasn't home. I made the peanut sauce exactly as written except I used vegetable oil.
