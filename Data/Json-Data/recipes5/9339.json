I'm glad I did. I made a lot of substitutions due to personal preference: A small amount (1/2 t.?) of powdered chipolte chilies in place of the whole canned ones Saracha hot chili sauce in place of the hot sauce and nonfat plain yogurt for half the oil.I also added some lemon juice to brighten it up a bit. The end result was perfect. This is a tasty recipe that would also work well as a spread. Thanks!",

I only used 1 tsp of olive oil added 2 TB lowfat plain yogurt added 2 TB lemon juice instead of the water and 2 TB leftover salsa. Cilantro would definitely go well with this recipe. I omitted the salt and pepper... didn't seem to need it. Overall a great alternative to guacamole... especially since avocados are so pricey and edamame are so inexpensive! Thanks for the recipe!",

The cumin and garlic were way too strong and completely obscured the flavor of the edamame. Maybe that's the point but I love edamame and would like to be able to taste it. I think this would work much better with Asian flavors: ponzu or soy sauce sesame oil wasabi and pickled ginger served with home-baked pita chips sprinkled with Chinese 5-spice or even used as a filling for nori rolls. Thanks for the inspiration though.",
