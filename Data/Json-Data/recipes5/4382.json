It was very yummy but rich. The fish however was bland. I did salt and pepper it before I stuffed it even though the recipe didn't say to. When it was almost done baking I sprinkled some paprika on the top to give some color. It looked sickly without it. Next time I will use some Old Bay on the fish itself. Overall very good and I will make it again. The family loved it. UPDATE: 6 YEARS LATER..... I happened to find crab meat and rockfish on sale in the same week and remembered this recipe. (We live in CO so it's a big deal). This time I did not use but about 3/4 of the crab meat. I seasoned the fish with Old Bay before rolling. Then I just buttered salted and peppered the tops before baking. The fish was done before the filling was really hot. Make sure you leave your filling out at room temp for a little while so it is not stone cold. To give the tops some color I broiled it for a few minutes. Then the Piece de Resistance was the \"Wine Sauce for Seafood\" recipe that I poured on top of each piece as served. Wonderful!",

But it was delicious and flavorful all the same. I was afraid that the fish would look pretty (as another reviewer said) \"sickly\" without a coating so I brushed the outside with butter and sprinkled with paprika. This was a lovely filling that didn't take away from the fish at all. Nice balance. Some kind of sauce probably wouldn't be bad but wasn't necessary either. The fish was moist and the dish was very satisfying. I paired it with smashed red potatoes and green beans. I will make this again. Thanks to Chesapeake Baybe for the recipe and to Paula who encouraged me to try a dish with no photo (now submitted!):) I will definitely make this again.",
