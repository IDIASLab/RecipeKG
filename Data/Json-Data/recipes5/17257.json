I was looking for a healthy cake/bar with applesauce that we can eat as a family for dessert and not blow a bunch of calories! This turned out to be a good starting point. I used turbinado sugar (same sweetness as processed but comes in crystals--still has that molasses flavor but lighter). We had some leftover cinnamon applesauce so I used that and the little bit of extra cinnamon was great. Instead of raisins I chopped up half of a big gala apple (skin on important vitamins) and used about a third of a cup of chopped walnuts. I also used 2/3 whole wheat flour instead of all white. That said it's a delicious moist bar with a wonderful flavor and I think the apples and walnuts make it much more satiating too. It's also very quick and easy to make popped it in as I was making lunch. The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is because I made so many changes and didn't leave it as-is.",

Only used 1/2 cup brown sugar, but next time will use 1/3, because the raisins really make it sweet enough for our taste, even with wheat flour. Also increased the spice, since we like more of a kick: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves (I don't have or use pumpkin pie spice). I sprinkled 1/2 cup chopped walnuts on top, rather than ice them.  Thank you!",
