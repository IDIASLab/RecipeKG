A little vinegar-y for our tastes so I think next time I'm going to use half of the brine and use beer for the rest of the liquid once in the crockpot and add a little more brown sugar into the spice blend.  I like cooking meat with beer in the crockpot as it adds a certain sweetness.  I think this might balance the vinegar out for me.  I look forward to trying it again soon!!",

The BEST BBQ I have EVER had bar none! I stored the pulled pork in the liquid in the fridge and no one least of all me could leave it alone!

Every time I run into one of the guests they bring it up again. What I did was after pulling the pork I added about 3-4 tablespoons of KC Masterpiece Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce and mixed that up real well. Then I put a bowl of the same sauce on the table so everyone could put on as much or little BBQ sauce as they wanted. It's been said this BBQ was as good as any restaurant and I'm in NC where BBQ is a really big deal. While it takes a lot of time it's actually very little work. Other than the sauce I followed the recipe exactly. Best ever BBQ sandwiches",
