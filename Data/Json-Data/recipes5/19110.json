Didn't have the pie spice, pecans or egg, so I added a bit more cinnamon, chopped up an apple to add to the mix, and used egg beaters.  Also drizzled the top with honey and put it in an 8x8 pan.  Increased the bake time to 20-25 minutes so the middle would cook.  Found that with the addition of the apples it was awesomely sweet (just right for my taste).  However, I have some friends doing Weight Watchers and plan to try some adjustments next time for them.  Will try applesauce instead of butter, honey instead of sugar (and lessen the amount since I'm adding apples), and leave the peels on the apples (and add another half an apple)  to add even more of a fiber kick.  Think they will love it as much as I did!  Great recipe.  :)",

That second batch was slightly fluffier, moist and chewy, not crumby at all (the first was). i did omit the nutmeg and pie spice on both. I will try again with even less honey and banana chips, chocolate chips instead of cranberries/nuts. Healthier option than breakfast bars for the kids. ",
