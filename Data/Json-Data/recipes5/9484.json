I made it exactly as written except for one minor change: I had to add more oil to the parsley/walnut mix because it was a thick paste at first. No biggie. When I was done cooking the quinoa I thought there's no way this is going to be enough! Fret not bc this definitely makes enough for 4 good sized servings. I love how healthy this is and can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Next time I will add a bit of garlic as suggested. Thanks t_jones!",

I worried that I'd have to add honey to make this salad palatable but after mixing it all together it was absolutely delicious. I think I had more like 3 cups of broccoli but the pesto was still enough to coat all the ingredients. The only other mods I made were I used much more olive oil maybe 1/4 cup so that the dressing was easier to mix around and I used feta instead of blue cheese because I prefer it. The cucumbers add some crunch and the tomatoes a little sweetness so don't omit them. So tasty!",

I used brown rice instead of quinoa and my vegetables were broccoli red pepper and cucumber (I did not use cheese). I was having trouble blending the pesto so instead of adding even more oil (I had added about 1/4 of a cup at this point) I added balsamic vinegar along with some salt and pepper and a few more walnuts (I used about 1/3 of a cup). It turned out great! I kept the pesto separate so the vegetables would not get soggy. A perfect meal to take along for lunch during the week.",
