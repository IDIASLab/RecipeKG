The pomegranate juice inspired me to take a cue from Persian cuisine, so when preparing the braising sauce I (as the boss of my sauce) added cloves, a pinch of dried ginger and some Turkish pomegranate syrup. At the end, when making the reduction  I added some more spices and salt to taste and splashed in some Merlot before boiling it down. I had thought the meat needed to be in just one layer in the oven, but it cooked down so much I wished that I had cooked more.  \n\n@Chef John, you should start experimenting with pomegranate syrup!",

I used an entire head of garlic (why not?) I used fresh juiced poms (lucky me - just happened to have them) and i forgot all about the honey at the end again because we were so impatient. I thickened the sauce with a tiny bit of cornstarch (also because of impatience) and forgot all about the pumpkin seeds too. Next time and there will be a next time I'll try the details. But for now there is not one tiny scrap left. The mint and the rosemary with the pomegranate was a magical and aromatic combo. I served it with a side of couscous and yellow lentils roasted yukon golds with dill and tabouli salad - not bad for a school night;-)",
