Last, i added  a whole can of premade biscuit dough. i cut  each one in fours and topped the soup in the last 10 mins so we had cheaters dumplings.  SOOO good!!",

The potatoes are a great addition--they really add a nice flavor and texture to the soup. I would definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe!",
