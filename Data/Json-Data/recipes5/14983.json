Rather than garlic powder I tossed a few good sized cloves of garlic in the water to cook with the potatoes. I used probably half again as much horseradish as was called for and extra butter as well. The Parmesan cheese was a nice touch and is so subtle that my Parmesan cheese hating hubby didn't even notice it. We really enjoyed this and it complemented the roast beef I served it with perfectly.",

I also did not saute' the green onions because I don't really care for them cooked. Also I like my mashed potatoes very creamy so I added more milk than indicated. This would be an easy recipe to prepare low fat or even vegan with substitutions. If you are a fan of horseradish and want to try something a little different this is the recipe for you!

The only thing I did differently was use 2 garlic cloves instead of powder and cook them in the butter a few minutes before adding the green onions. I used red potatoes (a few extra since they were smaller) and skim milk. I wouldn't add all the milk first like the recipe states; I just splashed some in until it was the right consistency and it wasn't nearly 1/2 cup probably not even half that. Great with Slow Cooker Cranberry Roast from this site.",

Mashed potatoes are my favorite food so I was a little hesitant to try something different from the old standard I'm used to but these were fantastic. The horseradish really doesn't end up tasting like horseradish and with such a small amount it doesn't make the potatoes \"spicy\" or anything. It's just a really good flavor. I didn't have green onions so I used regular white onion chopped. I will try the green onions next time though. Highly recommended.",
