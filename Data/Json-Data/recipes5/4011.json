I doubled the garlic and sauteed the asparagus a couple of minutes more than called for. Skipped the olive oil entirely and used the bacon drippings for cooking the veggies. Very light tasty. I served it with citrus-marinated chicken but probably will skip that in the future and just go for the pasta. Thanks for the yummy combination of flavors!",

This version was particularly \"spring-like.\" And what elevates this version - it has bacon in it of course! Ohhhh BOY what fantastic flavor that added particularly since I left in a little of the bacon fat as well. Had it not been for the fact that this was a little heavy on the lemon juice I would have easily rated it five stars. I used only half the amount called for and it was still plenty lemony. A good sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan upon serving made this perfect.",
