You want to cook the meat not burn the buns. The meat mixture on the half a bun should not be a full quarter/third pound like a traditional burger. One pound of meat should be split between four buns (eight total open-faced burgers). Serving size should be two open-faced burgers (both halves of one bun). Make sure the meat mixture covers the entire bun surface even hang over it a bit. The meat mix will shrink as it cooks which will lead to a browning of the bun that is then exposed. Happy cooking & eating!",
