Since I am admittedly a sugar fiend I found the cookies to be a little less sweet than I would like so I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar for a total of 1 1/2 cups. The cookies received excellent reviews from the family both before and after the sugar adjustment though. The exact quote from a grateful taste-tester was \"You outdid yourself this time.\" Since canola is one of the wiser choices in terms of fats and walnuts also reside in the relatively benign family of fats alongside canola (let's not mention the chocolate chips I added though) I recommend this delicious oatmeal cookie to everyone.",

Thanks so much for the recipe:@) Update: I've been making these cookies with 1 1/4 cup LIGHT brown sugar (and no raisins) and (to me) they come out better this way...

It always turns out really well and my friends always ask for more. I love that it calls for vegetable oil instead of fat like many of the other recipes. I use vegetable oil to cook anyway so that is something that can always be used in my house but what am I supposed to do with fat? It's a good recipe that is easy to make. The dough is a little sticky so I set them by rolling them into balls with two metal spoons and then flattening it a little as I put it on the cookie sheet.",
