Using an oven safe skillet, I put in a lot of veggies, including cauliflower, broccoli, peppers, mushrooms, kale, spinach, and onion. Saut\u00e9 them until tender, mix in hashbrowns to slightly brown, add a good layer of cheese and cover with eggs. Any breakfast meat works great. Baking time is longer than noted in recipe, usually 20-25 min. at 325 F. Seasonings vary but our favorite is a Thai curry/cumin blend similar to cu-cu. Slices of tomato placed on top cook up nicely as well.",
