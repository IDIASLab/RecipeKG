While I liked it , it was a bit tangy for me as I am not a big fan of citrus zest, but it had a great holiday flavor that my family loved.  Make sure you taste throughout; you may want to add a little more brown sugar.  And, also, I had forgotten that cranberries float...just add enough water until they would be covered if they didn't float.  I don't think you can really mess up this really great recipe, so don't worry too much about that step.  Also, it makes A LOT of sauce.",

I'm guessing that's why the recipe calls for twice as much sugar as any other recipe I've seen for cranberry sauce. One comment even stated they were planning to add more sugar next time! Save yourself the trouble and simmer it for no more than 10 minutes after the berries pop. And add 1 cup of sugar instead!",

Next time I'm only lowering to \"5\" and I'll bet it doesn't take so long. It needed a little more sugar than listed as it was rather tart. Everyone liked it though and it was fun to make.",

UPDATE: I made the following changes for thanksgiving 2011: omitted the water slightly reduced the OJ used about 1.5c brown sugar and reduced the simmering time to about 20-25 minutes. SO MUCH BETTER! Because you're starting with less liquid you don't have to let it cook for so long to thicken up.
