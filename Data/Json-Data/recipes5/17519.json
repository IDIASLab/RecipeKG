As read in other reviews it is super important to let the ingredients soften. After cutting the ingredients in half I ended up only using two tablespoons Kahlua and one tablespoon milk. This dip is a lot thicker than other dips I have tried but you can change the consistency by adding more milk or cool whip. I am going to keep looking for the perfect fruit dip but this one is definetly a keeper. As for the ingredients I used fat free cool whip reduced fat sour cream and full fat cream cheese.",

Even though I put a cute little hand-made label by it so people would know what it was. They devoured the fruit platter but ignored the dip. (Oh well. And I bought a bottle of Kahlua specially for this!) It might go over better at a different type of event. (I think another reviewer mentioned bridal showers?)",
