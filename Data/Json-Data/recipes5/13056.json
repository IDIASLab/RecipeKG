I started by BOILING some boneless, skinless chicken thighs, (6 thighs). Then  I followed the beginning of the recipe with the onions and garlic..(.i sprinkled very little salt and pepper to the onions and garlic) because I was using real chicken thighs.  I cut a 1 whole red pepper, 1/2 cup olives, with pimento, and 1 1/2 box of raisins. I put 1/2 tsp cumin seeds and the original amount of oregano, with 2 bay leaves.  I put it all in the skillet and added 1/4 tsp ginger paste and 3 tablespoons of tomato paste. I added the diced tomatoes and then let it cook about 10 min. I removed the bay leaves and then...\n\nThen I added the boneless, skinless thighs, 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of rice and let that cook for 20 min. It was SUPERB!!! My home smelled like I was in another country. When the dish was done I topped it with a small sprinkle of cheese and a dash of tabasco sauce ( I like spicy) and the family went crazy. I can tell this is a keeper dish. EASY to make, flavorful and it will definitely taste better tomorrow. The downside is that I can tell I did not make enough. \n\nThank you for this dish...",
