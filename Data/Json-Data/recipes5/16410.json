Oh well.  Edit:  The next day it was much sweeter.  I guess it just needed some time for the flavors to settle.  It also stayed very moist for a full week.  I also forgot to mention that I made my own applesauce for this recipe and I added a glaze.  My fiance wanted an applesauce cake like his Grandma used to make so I did my best to accommodate.",

However it was half gone by 1 pm which is pretty good for our group and I got at least one comment it was really good. I thought it was a tad sweet but I tend to think that about most baked goods. Very easy too. I always buy butter flavored shortening so perhaps that added to it--not sure. I would like a few more spices in this to make it more of an applesauce spice cake. I baked in a bundt pan and while it was small it baked in the time alloted. Very good thanks for the recipe.",
