We used a 5 oz. can of tuna in oil, substituted 1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp. soy sauce for the anchovy paste, put in two large dashes of oregano and red pepper flakes, and added a dash of paprika as well. We also used two cans of Campbell's tomato soup, which is from concentrate, so we made the soup following the directions on the can, then used 3 1/2 cups of that for the sauce, so we didn't add the additional 1/2 cup of water. We substituted pre-grated Parmesan cheese for the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and 1 tsp. marjoram for the tarragon. And to finish, we garnished it with just some of the leftover Parmesan with no red pepper flakes. And although we weren't able to make this recipe exactly how it's supposed to be, we loved what we ended up with and plan to add this recipe to our list of favorites!",

But I do like traditional tuna casseroles, and this sounded good and different, so I gave it a go.  WOW!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the tarragon.  I swear I bought some, but somehow I didn't end up with it at home, so I subbed just a dash of fennel instead, which did lend a lovely flavor.  This is surprisingly and amazingly delicious!  The only non-condensed cream of tomato soup I was able to find was a tomato and basil variety, which was wonderful.  I had 4 cups of it, so I added it all, since the only tuna in olive oil I found was in cans, and I had a little over 8 ounces of that as well.  Yum, yum, yum!  Will definitely be making this again and again (and will definitely make sure I get home with the tarragon next time too!).  Thanks Chef John!  :)",

Thanks to Chef John I always have Pacific brand organic creamy tomato soup, low sodium version, anchovy fillets, and good quality oil packed tuna on hand so this is almost an \"instant\" dinner. Throw some frozen peas in with the pasta during the last 5 minutes of cooking for an extra veggie boost. You can also sub wine for the water. Tonight I'm serving it over Barilla brand spinach and cheese tortellini, since I'm out of penne. Thanks again to Chef John for clueing me in to the dry tortellini, they are delicious and handy to have around. I'll be making this with gluten-free pasta when my celiac houseguest arrives in a couple weeks.",

I also made two cans of condensed soup following the directions for soup with milk. (I did use half cream & half milk for a richer sauce.) Then I used about 3 1/2 cups of this soup in place of the soup and 1/2 c. water called for in the recipe. I followed the spice measurments in the sauce.

Maybe my expectations were unrealistic but this dish just didn't measure up as an alternative to the real thing. It isn't that the dish is bad -- far from it -- but that it just doesn't resonate with myself or my family like I had thought. My two girls thought that it had too much tarragon in it and that that flavor came to dominate the dish. This dish was good enough that I plan on making it again for another try but will cut the tarragon in half. Hopefully we'll like it better and if so I'll update my review accordingly. As a final thought though my recommendation is to stick with the soup and sandwiches for that flavor combination instead of this dish.",
