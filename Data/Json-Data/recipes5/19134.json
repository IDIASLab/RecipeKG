Bf said the sauce reminds him of the Jack Daniel sauce at TGIF that he likes but the alcohol in this was a bit too strong. We used Wild Turkey whiskey because that's what we had so we may try to use Jack Daniels next time or use less. It makes a lot of sauce in comparison to the Kielbasa so I may use more Kielbasa next time. I tried it plain and on a bun; it was good both ways we will just modify the alcohol a bit next time.

I added just a few more ounces of the ketchup and bbq sauce. I did use a little more brown sugar and kept with the 1/2 cup whiskey. Simmered on low for 6 hours just as stated and was very pleased. I did taste test throughout the day and it seems that while it tasted good throughout the day the long simmering time really does the trick and they became so tender after the full 6 hours.",
