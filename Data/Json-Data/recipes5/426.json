'Big Fat' refers not only to size of the beans, but also to the huge flavor of this dish. Use the largest beans you can find: Gigante beans are the best, but Corona and lima beans also work great. Serve alongside grilled meat or simply with extra feta for a great vegetarian main.",

It took much longer for the sauce to reduce and for the onions to soften; I kept adding 15 minutes to the baking time. I believe I baked this at least 2 hours maybe a bit longer. I didn t care for the feta on top the first night I made it; somehow it seemed to clash with the tomato sauce for me. But I love the dill and the other flavors. I even had it on top of leftover spaghetti aglio e olio and it was terrific! Tomorrow I m adding feta to my leftovers.",
