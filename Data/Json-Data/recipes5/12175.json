        "description": "A more complex version of ketchup that will make your kitchen smell great and has a bit of a kick. I made this when I had some extra tomato juice and wanted to figure out a way to use it. I'm sure you could substitute different peppers depending on what is on hand but the shishito and roasted Anaheim added a wonderful flavor. Adjust chilies to your heat preference. These amounts make it spicy but not hot.  I used the celery heart with two stalks because that is what was left.",
