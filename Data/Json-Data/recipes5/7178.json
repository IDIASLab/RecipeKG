Made as written except that I cut back the bread crumbs to 1 cup and the Romano and adobo seasoning accordingly. Even then I only used up about 1/4 of my breadcrumb mixture and the chicken was very well coated. Next time I will cut back the breadcrumb mixture to use only 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. Also I think I could have increased the initial bake time to 30 minutes. That said the chicken was wonderful (served up with Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes) and looked beautiful on the plate. I WILL be making this one often.",
