It came out delicious and my family absolutely loved it. Will definitely make this again!!!!!!",

I assembled the casserole as directed and baked it 30 minutes uncovered, as it did not say to cover but it really should have been covered. Some of the noodles on top got too dried out.  I topped with Mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  The layer of cream cheese, sour cream and cottage cheese was just that, a layer of rich cheese with little to no flavor - the top was dry - the middle too cheesy, yet bland.   The kids might like this with more sauce added to it.  Overall, we weren't thrilled.  Sorry, I wanted to like this recipe.",

Also, it is key to use cheddar cheese in this recipe, as stated. I was skeptical with it being a spaghetti recipe. However, the cheddar cheese really changes the flavor and is critical to the recipe. finally, if you find the creamy mixture too bland, add some garlic and/or Italian seasonings. Overall delicious!",

I had this dish at a friend's house and they gave me the recipe so I knew what modifications I would make when I cooked it for my family. With these modifications, I would give it a 5 stars - also, spray a large piece of foil and put on top of the dish while it's baking to keep it from drying out, remove before adding the parmesan cheese and then pop it back into the oven to bake the cheese, about 10-12 minutes. And as always, it's better the next day. USE SMALL CURD COTTAGE CHEESE!!! :)",
