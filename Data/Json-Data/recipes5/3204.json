In an effort to slim things out for a few of the guests that would be sharing it I used all low fat dairy ingredients and you never would have known it. That's coming from someone who thinks low fat dairy is tasteless. I used my magic bullet to cream the cottage cheese and everything was done within a half hour. There was such a unique combo of ingredients and the pumpernickel smelled wonderful in the oven. I can't wait to make this again this was gone in no time.",
