        "description": "Moqueca baiana is a rich seafood stew from Brazil, reminiscent of a mild curry but not made from a spice paste base. This recipe is for the Afro-Brazilian version of moqueca from the state of Bahia. There's also moqueca capixaba from Espirito Santo which uses tomato puree and annatto, lacking the African influence by omitting the coconut milk and dende oil (palm oil). Dende oil is the key ingredient in this recipe.",
