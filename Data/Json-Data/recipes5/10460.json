Use the beef, honeycomb. I've tried other types. It's just not nearly as good. I also cook the tripe in my pressure cooker. I'm sure its not necessary. But I think it makes it a lot more tender. Maybe it's just my pan, but I've found that using 1.5 cups of reserved tripe liquid in the 1st round (pancetta mixture) prevents some burning. I frequently also substitute a high quality, thick cut bacon for pancetta. Lastly, I like the dish a little more spicy, so I use 1 1/2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes.",

I am now working with a local large-animal veterinarian to find a source near me . The recipe here looks good , and I will use it as soon as I can .
