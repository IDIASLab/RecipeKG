        "description": "This meat loaf is so moist and full of flavor; you won't want to even call it meat loaf. I had this idea one day when I didn't want to add bread crumbs. Anyway, if you make this you won't be sorry. It's got tons of veggies, but the kids will never know it. It's so juicy, and you can add so many different things to make it more interesting.  Add two cups bread crumbs and a cup of BBQ sauce for another tasty variation. I've also added shredded Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese to the meat to make it like a cheeseburger! I've also just made this with onions, carrots, and A-1 sauce (that's the way I like it best).",

It's actually a really great way to sneak in some extra veggies and makes for a really delicious juicy flavorful meatloaf. I started to make this but halfway in I just couldn't complete the recipe as instructed. I would suggest using only half of the vegetables in this recipe omit the potato entirely and omit the extra seasonings; the vegetables really add a lot of flavor to the beef and I think the seasonings compete with it. That is a LOT of Dijon mustard and a large amount of dried herbs which tend to be more potent than fresh anyway. I used the meat vegetables eggs a few dashes of worcestershire sauce and a bit of extra salt but nothing else and it was fine.",

For the topping after the meatloaf was cooked I opened a small can of tomato sauce and put on top then cooked again for 15 minutes but it did not help with the taste at all. This recipe is a definite flop!",

Suggest leaving out the rosemary if you re not a fan of it. I did top it with a ketchup brown sugar coating and it contrasted poorly with the overall flavor. Excluding the ketchup it was a very very moist meatloaf that was too moist and vegetable tasting for most family members. If I was going to remake this recipe I would start by halving the vegetable mixture and reducing the carrot a little bit.",
