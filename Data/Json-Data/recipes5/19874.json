These two meets make the best Chislic.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because I am glad it is listed but left a star off because there is way too much added to good meat.   As a native South Dakotan that lives in the heart of Chislic Territory I have to tell you that \"real\" Chislic is made from sheep (mutton) or deer (venison).  Cut it up in cubes as shown here, (no spices, no marinating).  skewer 5-6 pieces on sicks and deep fry for about 3 minutes.  When it comes out of the fryer sprinkle with garlic salt--thats all--you don't need all the extra spices listed in this recipie to make true original Chislic.  Chislic is traditionally served with saltine crackers and beer.  (It is not necessary to use skewers).",

There are a lot of different flavors at play in this recipe. It s a little sweet with a teriyaki flavor but you can taste the chili powder. I didn t add any pepper thinking all of the chili powders were more than enough but it definitely needs to have some black pepper to round out the combination of flavors. My husband thought it tasted a lot like beef jerky and I was thinking the exact same thing. Also you could use any cut of beef if you didn t want to spend the bucks on sirloin but sirloin is by far the most tender and juiciest.",
