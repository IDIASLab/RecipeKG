The apple juice helps to cut some of the acidity of the lemon so there is still a nice tart bite to the sauce, but it's not overpowering. The addition of artichokes made for a nice, light sauce that complemented the chicken nicely!",

I love having too much sauce so I can sop it up either with pasta (capellini in this case) or with bread. For the oil I used lemon olive oil and because I didn't have fresh parsley I used cilantro. I only had a can of artichoke bottoms so I did add some marinated artichoke hearts but only a few for variety because the bottoms are so solid! Otherwise I followed the recipe. Excellent dinner!

My husband liked this but I thought it was TOO tart from the lemon. SO my best advice is if doubling the sauce to have with pasta I would NOT double the lemon juice! I followed another reviewers advice and didn't double the artichoke but wished i had because I love artichokes that much! I think with some tweaking this would be really good. I used half and half for the lower fat content and ended up having to thicken the sauce with the ol' corn starch/water thickener. I also added more parm apple juice and even a little sugar to alleviate the tartness. They helped some. Just not my cup-a-tea I guess!",
