I also used the juice of half a lemon and 4 or 5 tblsp. of orange juice and the sauce was not too tart at all. Next time I may use PAM instead of oil to fry the fish. Also I suggest doing the sauce in a separate pan from the fish and have them both going at the same time so that the sauce is ready as soon as the fish is done. This doesn't give the fish a chance to cool down at all or get soggy.",

The entire cooking of the meal came together in under 10 minutes....amazing! Served it with rice and asparagus. It was such a light and refreshing fish recipe. Thanks for submitting it.",

I didn't have any fresh orange juice so I used a Tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate. I also added 1/2 or 1 tsp (I didn't measure!) of honey because I had read other reviews that said it was too bitter. It took away just a little of that bite from the citrus. It was really good! We used it with some Wild Alaskan Salmon that I seasoned with salt and pepper seared on high heat and then finished off in the oven. The citrus complimented the buttery salmon very nicely. I'm going to use the extra sauce over some asparagus tonight.",
