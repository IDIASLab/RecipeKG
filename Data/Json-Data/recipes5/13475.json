I left out the milk powder as we can't have it worked fine. I baked it 325 degrees in my convection oven for 45 minutes and it was perfect. Even after cooling it's great with a texture very similar to heavier whole wheat bread which I love. I am thrilled to have this recipe. Thanks!!!",

I will try this recipe in a week or so. But I wanted to leave some tips. Use a thermometer and when the internal temp reaches 190oF then the bread is done. Also I preheat the oven to 150oF. Turn it off put the bread dough in and it rises quite well. Or if it is over 100oF outside I put it in the sun with plastic wrap over it.",

Maybe that could be added for other first-time breadmakers? I too found that an extra cup of water was needed. Without it it was as dry as pie dough. Other than those notes the bread is fantastic!
