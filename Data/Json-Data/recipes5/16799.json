As I scraped the flesh away from its skin, it was gritty and dry, not mushy or smooth as I thought it would be. I had already mixed the eggs, sugar etc. so I had to give it a try. It poured into the pie crust (two regular sized ones) like water! I was so upset because I was to take it to Thanksgiving dinner the next morning!! It baked up beautifully and not a crumb was left the next day!  I'm making another (one deep dish this time) and this time the pumpkin scraped off smooth like it is out of a can, NEVER fear, it will work out no matter the texture of the pumpkin!  I used the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe from this site.....it's terrific!!!",

The recipe itself is great otherwise. Note: I only use 3/4 can of the evap milk or my filling seemed a bit loose. I personally think making fresh puree makes a difference so I prepare more pumpkin puree (frozen in 2C containers) for another time. I'm also not into making crust so I use the Ms Smith pre-made pie shells or Pills ready crust which are pretty darn good for store bought and less fuss. Oh I forgot...I also blind bake the pie crust and cool b4 filling to avoid soggy crust (375 for 10 minutes) If your pie filling seems loose at the end of baking time turn the oven off and just leave it until it's more \"set\". Good stuff thanks for the post!",

Another variation is to use the struesel topping from the \"Brown Family's Favorite Pumpkin Pie\" recipe also on this site. The streusel is great with walnuts or my family's favorite- pecans. YUM!

I served a few different pie options and the ones that chose pumpkin literally stopped the conversation to go on and on, and ON about how this was the BEST pumpkin pie EVER.  A few things:  I cooked the pumpkin longer than it said (maybe mine was bigger?).  The pie going into the oven was SCARY with how runny it was.  I thought for sure it wasn't going to turn out (have no fear-it does set).  The filling was enough for two pies.  I mixed up my own pumpkin pie spice since I already own those spices.  Here is the ratio(have to make about 3 times this for this recipe and measure out what you need): 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice  Excellent recipe.  I will be using only this one.  Amazing what a difference fresh pumpkin makes.....",

I was told at Thanksgiving that they wished I'd made my sweet potato pie instead... The texture was good but the flavor was lacking. Not sure why but one pie cooked way longer than the other but still turned out ok.",
