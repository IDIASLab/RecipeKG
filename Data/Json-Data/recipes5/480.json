I thawed, then drained in screened spoon. Then, I cooked it for 5 minutes. Then I put in my veggie blender and processed with 2 eggs and cheese. Then you might want to frig for 20 minutes so it is easier to work with. (May I suggest that making several batches at a time and freezing for time saving) Then I took the onion, garlic, celery and chopped chicken and stir fried until chicken was cooked. Then I added veggies. Which I decided at this point I am using frozen veggies! Then I added chicken broth and butter. Also, Instead of using cornstarch I used Xanthum Gum. It has 0 NET CARBS! Also anthem gum is much thicker so start with smaller amounts in a separate cup, then add to the pan. I must say I am very pleased the way it turned out. The first time usually takes longer but now I think I have resolved some time issues. I may make it again. Hmm... Maybe..",
