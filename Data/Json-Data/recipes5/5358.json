They were not in more than 5 minutes (recipe says 5-10) and they were overdone.  I would also pre-cook the onions as they are still very crunchy when all is said and done.  I did not have a lemon to zest, so I omitted that and I substituted ground ginger instead of fresh, grated ginger since that was what I had on hand.  I made this with a garlic spinach recipe I found.  I was going to serve it over brown rice, but that didn't happen.  My daughter (5) liked it.  My 2 year old son, not so much.",

                "reviewBody": "Alright so several things are going on with this recipe that will lead to trouble. First of all I'm assuming \"spicy\" was meant in the hot pepper sense as turmeric is a very mild spice (in terms of heat). Second the recipe drowns everything in lemon. In fact there is far too much liquid here for a stir fry. If \"boil\" appears in your instructions then you aren't stir-frying you're boiling. Third that time estimate for the shrimp is way off. You certainly want to cook until opaque but that should take only 3 to 5 minutes. Here's my revision (I left out new vegetables but this recipe badly needs them. Broccoli snow peas cauliflower string beans or even a fruit like bell peppers would make great additions. I would also recommend serving this over rice or noodles) Juice and zest of half a lemon separated 1 Tbsp soy sauce or tamari (similar taste gluten free if that matters) 1 Tbsp oyster sauce 1 onion coarsely chopped 3-5 cloves of garlic minced 1 Tbsp grated ginger 1 tsp ground turmeric 1 tsp cayenne 1/2 tsp salt 2 tsp cumin seeds 1 lb of shrimp (size determines cook time) 1 Tbsp coconut sesame or peanut oil Pepper flakes to taste Mix lemon juice soy sauce oyster sauce ginger turmeric cayenne and salt then add to a plastic bag or bowl with the shrimp shake or mix them together and set aside in the fridge if made more than 15 minutes ahead.
