One tip is to mix the topping ingredients in the food processor--just pulse until it looks like coarse crumbs--fast and easy.",

Needs some spices, though, cinnamon, nutmeg or a combination.  I've tweaked this several times and my favorite included cinnamon in the topping, pecans instead of walnuts and I used fresh cranberries, not dried.  I spiced & sweetened them up by simmering 1 cup cranberries in about 3/4 cup water, the honey and  a cinnamon stick and a couple strips of orange peel studded with whole cloves.   Stirred that mixture (removing stick, peel & cloves) in with the apples and pears.",
