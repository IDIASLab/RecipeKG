This works with pretty much anything you want to throw on it and if you have crescent roll dough, that works for a good \"crust\", too. Just lay it out on the baking sheet like the recipe states, pinching together the seams, and bake for 12-15 minutes. My husband and kids like their breakfast pizza with bacon AND sausage but I like mine with a mix of veggies, like red pepper, red onion, mushrooms, black olives and jalapenos! This recipe is always a winner, no matter what you want to put on it AND if you coupon, it costs you next to nothing for the biscuits/crescent rolls. NOTE: Very important. If you have cranky pans, you might want to squirt a little non stick spray on your pans before you lay out your dough, otherwise you might have an issue getting your pizza out of your pan. I learned this the hard way.",

If you don't like the looks of one, click on it and find another! As to the recipe, I made my own crust-it is so simple and doesn't contain all the weird stuff in pre-made stuff.  I did make some gravy out of the sausage I added and put it on a partially baked crust.  I did it because my husband loves biscuits and gravy and thought he'd like it better that way.
