A trick I use for pasta and potato salads is to double the dressing and put 1/2 on when first made and then let the salad sit in the fridge so the flavors \"marry\".  Then add some of the left over dressing right before you serve and when you want to eat the leftovers.  Of course in this case there will probably be no leftovers as this salad is so good.",

Used 1/2 the pasta, 5 hardboiled eggs (since they were about to reach their pull date) a little green onion for color, some sweet relish, paprika, and celery salt, and I added a little extra mayo (light of course!) per others suggestions as well as a bit of sour cream. Took out the green peppers.  Even with half the pasta it made about 8 cups of salad, which is perfect for us.  This one goes in the recipe box. Thanks for sharing!",

The only other variation would be to use the small can of sliced olives as opposed to whole. This recipe is a keeper. I'm passing it around!",

I was making it just for me my wife and my daughter but later in the day after helping a neighbor work on his roof he invited us over for a barbecue so I brought this new macaroni salad I made. Not knowing how it was going to taste since I just made it for the first time I was pleasantly suprised that everyone at the barbecue kepted raving about it. Everyone kept asking me how I made it and I told them how I got the recipe. Cheese combined with black olives and pimentos give it the right touch. Thanks again for a great quick and tasty macaroni salad.",
