Used my KitchenAid to mix the butter/cottage cheese and switched to the dough hook to add the flour. I turned it out and did the kneading/folding and I had my doubts but it came together and I could still see the lumps of cottage cheese. I chilled it for about 5 hours and rolled out one portion and made some sweet and some savory pieces. They turned out nice. Next time I'll roll it thinner I think 1/4\" was too thick. It doesn't have the many layers but it is light and tasty.",

I am pleased to report that it does work! OK maybe it's not as light and flaky as \"real\" puff pastry but man this is far and away the best recipe that I have found. Since it was a test I only made 1/4 of the recipe and made the dough into veggie tarts as a main course for dinner. My family (only 3 of us!) gobbled it all up in one sitting and asked me to make it again the next day!",
