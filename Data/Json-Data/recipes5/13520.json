As a self-professed breakfast food, cheese, and egg lover, quiche represents to me all that is right and good in a culinary concoction. Traditionally quiche is not a healthy option, what with all the cream and cheese that typically goes into it. I have literally experimented with different versions of a healthier quiche for years, but a couple of weeks ago I stumbled upon the perfect mixture, and I am pleased to share it here with all of you.",

Once I moved it, it cooked wonderfully. Also be aware of the crust you are using. Mine was a bit sweet. Frozen crust don't work well either as there's just too much moisture in the overall end product..resulting in a very soggy crust. Next time (and there will be a next time) I'm making my own crust. Sadly, this was so good that three people ate it all in one sitting. That kind of defeats the purpose.",

I used a frozen but thawed crust- it did not get quite done in the middle. Next time I will pre-bake the crust a little and brush the crust with egg to help brown it. Mainly I do not believe 325 deg is hot baking temp for quiche. I followed directions but then baked an additional 20 min at 400 deg. Other quiche recipes bake at 375-400 degrees so next time I will bake it from the beginning in that range. I'm so happy to have found a quiche recipe that doesn't use heavy cream. Thanks Becky!",

I ve made it multiple times including teenagers waiting for their hardworking contractor father to finish a project at our house and professional chefs. While the chefs knew there was no cream they thought it was first class. The teenagers who had never had quiche after eating my spare ( I always make two) asked if there was more (lol). My favourite version includes half a small onion chopped and cooked in olive oil 3 oz of high quality smoked ham and 1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese (OK I cheat a bit) and 7 oz reduced fat milk (1%). Becky s cooking time keeps the filling custard moist not the typically rubbery filling that passes for quiche. I use a frozen crust and carefully follow the package directions to prick the crust with a fork then bake until lightly brown before filling. Perfect crisp crusts every time. Thanks Becky for a great recipe!",
