I only had low fat coconut milk, and peanut butter in place of cashew butter to use--so that's what I did, and it worked out great! I probably added 2-3x more peanut butter (because I have a slight addiction) just for personal taste preference, and since my coconut milk was lower in fat too. I also used chili powder in place of the cayenne. I really enjoyed the ease of making this, the fact that it makes enough for leftovers, it's nutritious, and it's delicious! Will definitely make this again! Thank you so much for the recipe!",

I was surprised how very mild the flavors were considering the amount of spices, the coconut  cream/milk really mellowed it down.
