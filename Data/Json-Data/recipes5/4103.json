The dressing is way too much for the amount of veggies though so I used two very large cucumbers doubled the rest of the veggies and the herbs and added a green bell pepper (or you could just halve the dressing but I was making this as a main dish and I wanted leftovers to take to work for lunch). The dressing is more like a paste after you mix it up but don't worry--it thins as you toss it with the veggies but it takes a few minutes of stirring (I would recommend not seeding the cukes so you'll have more liquid). This is a new favorite!",

I was frustrated by the tahini dressing when I made this but I liked the flavor in it so I did what another reviewer suggested and added yogurt hoping that would help with the consistency. For my single portion I added 3/4 tbsp. of low fat yogurt and that really helped. This has nice flavors so it's definitely worth a try and I ended up enjoying the whole salad very much.
