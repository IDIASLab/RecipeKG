                "reviewBody": "3.15.20 I followed this recipe to the letter (with the exception of using fresh green beans) down to the point where I had to make a few tweaks to salvage it for dinner.   First, I think this is WAY too much bacon to sprinkle on the top of a 2-cup green  bean casserole for 6 servings.  We\u2019re not big eaters, but seriously, 2 cups of green beans for 6 servings with nothing additional except the sauce?  I scaled this down to 3 servings, cooked it in a very small baking dish, and as suggested by the recipe submitter, I added French\u2019s French Fried Onions instead of of bread crumbs,  The cheese sauce was extremely thick, so I added more  liquid attempting to thin it out.  Still, the sauce consistency was not good.  I would also suggest making your cheese sauce, and then folding in your green beans at the end.  Before adding to my baking dish, I tasted, thought it was bland, so I added some salt and pepper.  I was hoping for a flavorful  green bean gratin with a creamy, cheesy consistency without the addition of canned soup, but that just didn\u2019t happen.  All I can say is there must have been a black cloud hanging over my house today.  So sorry for the bad first review.   I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying it, but this just didn\u2019t work for us.",
