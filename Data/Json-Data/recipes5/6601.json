I tweaked the recipe inspired by other reviews: doubled the oil subbed organic 2% cow milk for soy used 10 drops of liquid stevia instead of the powdered. To boost nutrition and moisture I added half a mashed banana and the only spice used was nutmeg because I think that marries better with the banana flavor. To increase the kid appeal I threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips. Very easy to make will add these to our regular breakfast menu.",

It was still plenty sweet. We'll be making this again!",
