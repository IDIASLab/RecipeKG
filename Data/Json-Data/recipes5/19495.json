Things I may change for the next time I make this: I used Teriyaki Sauce instead of soy (I didn't have soy sauce), so I should reduce the amount of brown sugar. I would also throw in the green and white onions at about 2hrs into cooking so they don't just turn into sauce, I think if they cooked for less time they would add more appeal and substance to the dish. I also added red pepper flakes to spice it up a little, I think I put in about a tablespoon and it was a mild spice.",

I used reduced-sodium soy sauce and think next time I'll reduce the amount of soy sauce slightly since it seemed a bit overwhelming taste-wise and left an aftertaste.  Followed another reviewer's suggestion to cook 2 hrs. and then add the onion and green onion and cook an additional 2 hrs. and this worked well.  I also skipped the pre-browning in a skillet - since the steak is cooked in a very dark brown sauce, no one could tell that it wasn't pre-browned in a skillet. One less pan to wash!",

For the sauce, I used 1/2c. soy, 1c. water, 2 tblspns of brown sugar, 3/4c hoisin, 1 tsp. fresh grated ginger, and 3 cloves of minced garlic. Mixed that together and pour that over the beef, onions, and grren onions. Cooked on low for 6 hours... The smell was so great! The sauce thickened nicely and the meat was so tender. Served over steamed broccoli instead of rice for carb reasons....Delicious with pleanty of sauce that was not too sweet. My family loved this dinner. Thanks!",

Overall it was close to the Mongolian beef I like at the Chinese restaurant. The next time I will try to add a little Chinese five spice....",
