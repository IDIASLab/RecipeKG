The fennel is a GREAT addition to this stuffing. When I was sauteing it made my whole kitchen smell wonderful! If you can't find a fennel bulb in your supermarket (I couldn't) it's perfectly acceptable to use a teaspoon of fennel seeds and add a 1/2 cup additional parsley instead. My only criticism is the time/temp for baking. I put the oven on 300 and after 20 min the fish was barely warm! After another 20 min on 350 I finally stuck it in the broiler for 10 min and that was perfect. You'll have to experiment with the temp to get it right but I recommend finishing it off in the broiler so it crisps up nice.",
