That's one of the great things about this one, you can customize it how you like by adding your favorites! I think the amount of heat in the dish depends on your cajun spice you use. I used 1 1/4 T of \"Slap yo mama\" cajun spice and it was REALLY spicy! I will use maybe 3/4 T next time. I did put in a heaping T of sour cream to mellow it out and I think it added a little thickness as well which was nice.
