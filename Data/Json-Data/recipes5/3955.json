                "reviewBody": "I left out the Burgundy because I didn't have any on hand.  I wouldn't recommend adding the raw steak to the cooking onion mixture.  It doesn't develop a beef flavor.  Better to brown the beef in a separate pan and add it, together with some of the juices, to the onion mixture.\n\n14 ounces of consomme makes a pretty liquid sauce.  If you have absorbent noodles they will take some of the liquid.  But I'd recommend making the thickening liquid (flour and water) with 3 tablespoons of flour.  You don't have to use the whole amount, just add as necessary.  (I ended up using 3 Tbs of flour).  Either that, or start by using only 9-10 ounces of the consomme and adding more as needed to keep the sauce at the right consistency.\n\nAs to the lemon juice, that can really overpower a dish.  I took 1/2 of a lemon and \"forked\" it over the pan a couple of times.  I probably added less than 1/2 of a teaspoon.  A little fresh lemon juice goes a long way.\n\nThese exceptions aside, this is a really nice and easy recipe.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company.  Thanks for letting us have this dish!",

Then I browned the meat BEFORE I cooked the onions, etc.  Once the meat was browned I removed it from the pan with the \"gravy\" that was made from the drippings and the flour.  Then I added a bit more butter to the pan and sauteed the onions and garlic in the SAME pan - this way you get the flavor from the leftover drippings and browned pieces in the pan (some reviews said the flavor was bland so I thought this could help).  I also cooked the mushrooms longer than the recipe called for to cook out more moisture since many previous reviews said the sauce was too runny.  I also used 1/2 the amount of onions called for, added a few glugs of Brandy rather than Burgundy (I didn't want my sauce to be reddish), and didn't use quite as much lemon juice as called for in the original recipe.
