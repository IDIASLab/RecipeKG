Next time I'll try to use the flour mixture on the scallops but maybe bake or broil them. *Update* I've tried this a couple dif ways and have had great success. First, leave out the flour-you don't need it. I put all the seasonings in a ziploc bag with enough olive oil and lemon juice to make a marinade. I used the seasonings called for plus, minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, parmesan cheese and old bay seasoning. Just put whatever amount looks good to you in the bag. Marinate it for several hours in the fridge, turning occasionally. I broiled the scallops, about 5 min per side and I tried some more in a nonstick pan with Pam instead of oil over med heat. Both ways turned out great! Just don't overload your pan in the oven or on top. I only cooked 8 or 10 at a time in a 9 x 13 foil covered dish sprayed with Pam and probably the same amount on the stove. I did get a little smoke in the oven towards the end but that was from the scorching juices and reuse of the same foil. I'm sure if you used fresh foil you wouldn't have a problem. I just threw away the foil! No mess at all! These have been scrumptious! I cooked the rest of my shrimp the same way. Even better! They are the huge 13-15 count that I found on sale at a local supermarket. They are the kind that come with the shell on but have been deveined so it is cut on the back and really easy to take off. Very nice and meaty texture.",

If a person was to use the amount of herbs and lemon pepper recommended I think they'd be very disappointed as it would be overpowering.  Also, scallops should be seared over medium high heat, not high heat.  Once they crust and release themselves from the surface of the pan, in about a minute or two, turn and finish on the other side for another minute or two.  Finally, using oregano and thyme on scallops was an experiment for me out of curiosity, but now that we've tried them we know oregano and thyme is not the best choice for the delicately flavored scallops.",

I defrosted mine, then placed them on top of 3 paper towels, and wrapped them with a couple of kitchen towels.  After an hour or so, I then put the flour and seasonings into a Ziploc bag, and shook about 1/3 of the scallops at a time.  The frying pan I used is a ceramic-lined Cuisinart frying pan - it's really important to have a good non-stick pan.  I heated the olive oil until very hot, then placed some of the scallops into it, being sure to leave some breathing room between scallops.  When those were nice and brown on each side, I took them out and placed them on a plate.  I then seared the 2nd and 3rd batches the same way.  When all of the scallops were seared, I poured about 1/3 cup of white wine into the pan, then 1/4 cup of butter and some lemon juice.  After pouring that delicious sauce over the scallops, I served them over fettuccine.  We sopped up the rest of the juices with some ciabatta roles.  Fantastic!!!",

I think this would be a hard recipe to screw up, as long as you don't overcook the scallops. They cook so fast.\n\nMy family really liked this. I served it with scalloped potatoes and wild green salad with walnuts, blue cheese crumbles and raspberry vinagrette. Very fancy but easy. I'll make this again.
