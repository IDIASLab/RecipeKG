My number one favorite entree at a local hole in the wall Cantina is Carne con chili and it's packed with flavor. I hate to knock anyone's recipe as I am not a cook by any means but this dish wasn't even remotely comparable. There is no flavor. It tasted like green tomatoes with an overwhelming amount of heat and I love spicy foods. \n\nI guess the only positive thing I can say is that it's likely a good start to a decent sauce but needs much more flavor added.",

You can also change it around, if you want more of a red sauce, by adding more tomatoes and less tomatillos. Also instead of discarding the garlic, I added it to the blender with the rest of ingredients. either way, it's REALLY good and very easy to make! Also if you don't have or can't find chile de arbol, you can use Cayenne peppers :)",
