My whole family, even the 2-year-old, loved the tacos and we ate the leftovers at our very next meal. After the mixture is cooked, fill flour tortillas with it (hard shells are great, too), add shredded Cheddar cheese on the top, and shredded lettuce.",

I found peach salsa and mango-pineapple though so I bought a jar of each one of them and used those so obviously omitted the can of pineapple. I expected this to be way too sweet (might have been if using straight pineapple) but the cayenne gave it such a kick that the faint sweetness was welcome. The chicken was great in tacos but would be great on a salad too. Definitely a keeper!",
