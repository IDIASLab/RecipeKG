Insteat of taco shells they put down a bed of tortilla chips and put the topping on that and ate it like nachos. WONDERFUL!!!",

My husband was stunned when he saw me mixing the preserves into the pan but was quick to say \"these are really good..I'm surprised\"! We didn't think they were too sweet, in fact there is just a touch of sweetness. Just be sure to use only the amount called for regarding the apricot preserves. I would recommend trying the cubed pork for some 'bite'. I used leftover shredded pork that I had on hand and by the time everything else was added, it was a bit mushy, so I would think the minced pork would be the same. I served these with the usual taco toppings.",
