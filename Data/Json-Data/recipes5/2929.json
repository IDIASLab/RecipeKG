This is one of the easiest and most delicious ways to cook veggies. I cut way back on the oil and used low sodium soy sauce. After the veggies were done marinating. We put everything into a foil pan that we sprayed with a bit of Pam so nothing would stick. Great side dish for grilled meats.",

I love everything about this recipe - the choice of vegetables, the cooking method, and particularly the marinade, which was just down right perfect. Light, fresh, and not overly seasoned, so the flavors of the vegetables are crisp and clean.  Hubs cooked this over a charcoal fire in a perforated grill pan, about 10 minutes. This went over well not only with Hubs and me, but with our dinner guests too.  I know Hubs will make sure this makes a repeat appearance as he was especially fond of this.",

I marinated the veggies in a gallon-sized Ziploc bag (for about two hours) and grilled them in an aluminum foil pocket sprayed with cooking oil. I sprinkled the veggies with fresh ground pepper and sea salt before wrapping them. We grilled them for 8 minutes on each side and the veggies were cooked aldente. They held their shape and color and the flavor was magnificent. We will definitely make these marinated vegetables again soon. We may also experiment with some fresh herbs from our garden (basil or rosemary?). Thanks for such a healthy delicious side dish.",
