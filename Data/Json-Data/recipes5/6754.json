                "reviewBody": "6.25.16  First, I don\u2019t think this recipe is written very well.  AR typically does a fair amount of editing, and I\u2019m surprised that they didn't question some of the issues that I had.  For example, it calls for \u201c1 pound cooked pasta.\u201d   How much dried pasta do you put in the pot? I have NEVER seen a recipe that called for \u201ccooked\u201d pasta.  I measured out 8 oz dry noodles, remeasured after cooking, and ended up 14-1/4 oz if that\u2019ll help you.  If you want to taste pieces/chunks of the tuna, I\u2019d recommended that you don\u2019t add in the tuna until after you\u2019ve mixed your other ingredients.  Just mixing up the soup, sour cream and mayonnaise takes quite a bit of stirring to incorporate, and if the tuna is in there, you\u2019ll end up with tiny tuna shreds...just my opinion.  What purpose does it serve to cook a casserole in a loaf pan, unless you want to slice it like bread?  I used a casserole dish sprayed with non-stick cooking spray to be sure that I didn\u2019t have a baked-on casserole dish to clean later.  And what kind of bread crumbs should be used...dried or fresh?  I used some Italian panko, what I had on hand.   The casserole dish had more top surface area to cover with the bread crumbs than a 9x5 loaf pan, and I stopped at 1 cup (more than enough).  I can\u2019t imagine a 1-1/2 cup bread crumb topping on a loaf pan.  On the positive side, it does taste pretty good.  I would give this 4 stars for flavor, but 2 stars for the way it\u2019s written, so averaged out, that's  3-stars.",

I served this to a friend who hadn't had a tuna casserole since he was a child and he thought it was the best he ever had too.  I did make a couple of adjustments as follows: I suspected it might be too dry with the noodles so I increased the milk to  1 cup, I used two  5 oz cans of tuna,  I used 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped parsley, I sauteed 1 cup of sliced portabella mushrooms and added 1 cup of frozen peas.  If you want an outstanding tuna casserole, this one is the 5 star!!!!!",
