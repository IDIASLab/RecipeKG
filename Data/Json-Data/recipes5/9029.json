But I (and others) believe that my version is infinitely better, and I'm sure you will agree.  This light, fresh and healthy salad is perfect for summer days and presents well for BBQ's, potlucks, and dinner parties alike and it is guaranteed to impress and get rave reviews every time.",

I made EXACTLY as the recipe stated (for all you purists out there!), and I will make it again, but next time there are several minor things I'd do differently.  #1 - I'd cut back on the oil, or perhaps omit the oil & spray the carrots with a spritz or two of Pam cooking spray before roasting (they get a little soggy with all that oil). #2 - increase the slivered almonds and the dried cranberries -- at least 1/2 cup of cranberries (which I soaked in hot water for a few minutes & then drained, to soften them).  #3 - Decrease the blue cheese crumbles -- the flavor was a little over-powering!  #4. Omit the argula or substitute baby spinach leaves.    We ate it mixed with the greens at first, but then decided we liked it better as just a carrot/cranberry/almond sidedish, served at room temperature.     Thanks for the recipe Morgan Nowicki. Very good!",
