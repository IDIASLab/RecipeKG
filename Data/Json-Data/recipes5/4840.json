I use more hard boiled eggs frozen salad shrimp omit the dill and use MiracleWhip in place of the mayo. It's the only time I ever use Miracle Whip! Make it a day ahead except for the shrimp as the flavors meld and the macaroni tends to absorb the MW you may need to add a bit more. Then gently fold the shrimp in before serving.",

The first time I made it, I chopped the shrimp up, but I didn't like that the pieces were so small you couldn't really get a strong flavor from them, so the second time I left them whole and it was so much better.  And I use some I get at the meat counter rather than canned.  I also sub dried dill for fresh, and use about 1 1/2 Tbs, and that works well.  I also double the lemon juice.  One time I made these I had no eggs, and it tasted delish without them, too.  Really, I think this is a hard one to screw up no matter what you do...which is nice.",
