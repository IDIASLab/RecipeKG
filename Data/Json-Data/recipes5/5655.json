It was super easy to prepare and I didn't end up needing any additional liquid. Our grocery store didn't carry dried jalapeno (even in the specialty Mexican section) so I subbed a whole (deseeded and demembrand jalapeno). I'd make this again particularly when we're entertaining dairy free friends. THANKS for the recipe erin!",
