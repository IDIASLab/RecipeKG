Just a couple of tweaks I'll mention -- used a graham cracker crust. Also after reading a couple of comments on too-sweet canned cranberries I made my own (\"Cranberry Sauce I\" I belive -- 1 c. o.j. 12 oz of fresh cranberries and just 3/4 cup sugar instead of the 1 c. called for cook for about 10 min.) so I could control the sugar (obviously). Anyway like I said HUGE hit at our house -- thanks for a great recipe!!!",
