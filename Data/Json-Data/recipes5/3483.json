I used 2 whole fresh chilies (about 3 inches long) in place of the dried ones and substituted zucchini for the mushrooms for some additional nutrition (and also because zucchini is what I had on hand). In the final step I added the vegetable stock directly to the veggie mixture brought to a slow boil added the couscous covered the pan removed it from the heat and let it sit for 5 minutes. It looked beautiful and tasted magnificent!",

This is also a recipe that can be made ahead of time and quickly reheated in the oven. Watch the time on the covered simmering couscous it barely takes the 3 min.",

The sugar from the dates nicely caramelized the rest of the veggies near the end of the cooking process. The warming spices are perfect for the coming cold months!",

I also used about a tsp Sriracha hot sauce instead of the dried pepper because I couldn't find any and it gave it just the right amount of spice.

That being said there are a small number of recipes this one included where not only do I not understand how it achieved 5 stars but I literally cannot fathom how ANYONE would give this 5 stars. My father and I made it EXACTLY as written (we even went to a Chinese market to buy star anise). What does it taste like? It tastes like couscous with onions and mushrooms and a little sweetness. Nothing interesting about it and you couldn't taste the dates the star anise or the vegetable stock. It was alot of trouble for a bland dinner. One more thing star anise pods become like little pieces of plastic floating around in the dish and they are almost impossible to pick out until you have the unfortunate occasion to bite into one. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I do like couscous with onions and mushrooms:)",
