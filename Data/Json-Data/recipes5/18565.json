Mixed together in a bowl the sugar, cinnamon, salt and walnuts, then tossed in the apples.  Split the apple mixture between the two halves.  Topped each half with a tablespoon of butter. Placed in a glass baking dish and put in the oven (preheated to 350 degrees F) for 25 minutes uncovered to roast, then covered for and additional 20 minutes.    My house smelled wonderful, and the squash tasted sublime.  Next time, I think I'll add another teaspoon of brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon each of nutmeg and ginger, an extra pinch of cinnamon, and 2-3 tablespoons of applesauce to keep the apples moist while baking.  Also, I'm single and had a half left over.  Still tasted just as wonderful when reheated two days later! I will definitely adding this recipe to my autumn recipe standards!",
