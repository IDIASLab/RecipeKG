I only used the five strawberries mentioned and wished I would have upped them by a few more...ok doubled them...because the strawberry flavor just wasn't enough for me at only five. The hint of basil was nice though and not overpowering. This drink just wasn't of a shake consistency to me...more like a smoothie. Perhaps it would have been more shake-like had I upped the frozen strawberries. Good though and worth a try.",
