I let set up in the frig for 12 hours from start to finish. You could not shape with hands so because it still had that chunky look to it I put it in my Ninja Processor to make it smooth. That thicken some but not enough to shape. And even on the plate trying to make a pumpkin...was difficult because it was slowly spreading south. The over all flavor was really weird. I could taste the spices but there wasn't anything that screamed sweet savory...it was just a savory weird flavor. It probably would have held up better if the recipe stated 8 oz of cream cheese and not 1/2 the package. I served with Savory Triscuit Crackers but after each person took one bite no one wanted anymore. It's like hummus(and I love hummus)....guess you must really have to like the flavors and texture to like the recipe. I'm sorry to say I won't be making again.",
