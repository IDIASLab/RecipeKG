However \"sugaring\" the almonds was tricky burnt them on the first try. watch the amount of butter. also the dressing though good is heavy. do NOT put on until just before serving. after that doesn't take long for the fruits to turn into mush. also the prep time on this has got to be wrong. 15 minutes? took me that long to do the mango and papaya and get them in the blender for the dressing. 55 minutes although I did use an extra mango. still way off. I gave it 3 stars because it took too long was expensive and not a light summer salad as I thought.",
