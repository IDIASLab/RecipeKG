I did make a change and I added the arugula at serving time and I think I switched the order of layers to protect the bread from moisture so the leftovers would still be tasty. I put the cheese on the bottom so it could be a moisture barrier. I wouldn't mind making these again but I didn't need nearly as much cranberry sauce as this called for so that was kind of a dilemma since it turns out no one wanted it as a side dish except my 4yo.
