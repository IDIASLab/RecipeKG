        "description": "If sous vide eggs had been invented 2,000 years ago, there would have been entire books of the Bible dedicated to their praise. But at the last meeting of the Jet City Gastrophysics, we took a giant leap forward. You see, the beauty of a sous vide egg lies in its exquisite texture. After about an hour in the water bath, the yolks become buttery with nearly the texture of pudding. The only way to improve on this amazing transformation is to add a crunchy shell. These fried eggs make excellent tapas, particularly if your guests aren't expecting what's inside. Perhaps in another thousand or so years, we'll discover something even more delicious.",
