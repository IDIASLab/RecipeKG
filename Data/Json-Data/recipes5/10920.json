I used more chorizo than called for but think you can use pretty much what proportions you want and it will turn out.  It is my new go to for ease and taste.   I made it ahead the second time and then just popped in a 350oven with foil on top till it bubbled.",

Somehow we forgot the poblano peppers while shopping so had to make due with just the 2 jalapenos for heat. It had a slight kick but was mild enough for our spice-sensitive friend to enjoy. As someone who likes heat though I will definitely be including the poblanos next time along with maybe another jalapeno! Almost too good though -- we finished the whole thing in one evening.",

I added the 12 oz of Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese (by weight) and what looked like a beautiful pan of cooked chorizo and peppers became a big ball of melted cheese with bits of chorizo and peppers. And my final product looked way cheesier than the one on the web. I will try this again but will cut the Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese in half (measuring by weight).",
