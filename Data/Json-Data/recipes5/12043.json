I did add a garnish of some chopped pecans which gave it an interesting crunch. I did not see the need to bake in the oven the carrots were cooked perfectly and I didn t want to see them cook to mush and the sauce was plenty thick. It s a bit on the sweet side but bursting with apricot flavor. So many carrot recipes are partnered with orange it s nice to see the variation with the apricot which really works. No complaints here it was easy everybody liked it and I will make again.",

Very sweet-maybe a bit too sweet but that's with my changes. My husband's first words upon trying it were \"Wow. It's very good. Very very good. Wow.\" Thanks for such a creative recipe! It's nice to have something different on the table.",
