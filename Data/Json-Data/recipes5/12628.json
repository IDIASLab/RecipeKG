When this has cooled, whip 1 pint of whipping cream and fold into pineapple mixture.  Spread over \"jello cake\".  Enjoy!",

It takes about 40 MINUTES for each layer to completely set, so there's plenty of time for the next mix to cool down but no need to get all the flavors ready at once.  Make sure a layer has completely set before adding another; even if it seems pretty solid the force of pouring another layer on top can disrupt the previous layer.  So also, pour gently, just in case.  I made a \"frosting\" consisting of 2 c whipping cream, 2 t lemon rind & 1/4 c pineapple juice... turned out great!",

First of all make sure you have a level shelf with enough space for your container in the fridge. Second, mix your first package of Jell-o with 1 1/2 c boiling water. Pour this in your container and put in the fridge. Set the timer for about 45 minutes and in about 15 minutes prepare the second layer: mix the 2nd box of Jell-o with 1 cup boiling water and 1/2 cup of sweetened condensed milk. When the layer in the fridge is set, gently pour the room temp/not boiling Jell-o/milk mixture on top. Third: Set the timer for 30 minutes, mix another package of Jell-o with 1 1/2 cups boiling water. When timer goes off, gently pour room temp mix onto layer. Fourth, Set the timer for 30 minutes and prepare a Jell-o/ milk layer. Keep going from step three until finished. You have to wait longer for the first layer, because you put it in the fridge boiling whereas the subsequent layers are not so so hot. You guessed it this takes a long time, so make it when you need to clean the house or something.",
