I did use leftover mashed potatoes that were mashed w/ butter milk and s&p so I had to add a bit more flour. These were super flavorful with a nice crisp outside and creamy goodness inside.

He had only ever had latkes one other time when we fortunately stumbled upon a Jewish food festival in Savannah GA a few years ago and he enjoyed the ones we had then but he LOVED the ones we made with this recipe!! The only adjustments we made was to substitute white onions for green onions which added a lovely color and allowed the flavors of the potatoes and the seasonings to really take center spotlight and to add a few more tablespoons of AP flour to make sure the dough could hold a shape before we put it in the oil. Other than that we followed the recipe exactly as written and we ended up with latkes so rich and delicious that neither of us ended up bothering to add any condiments like the traditional applesauce. I seriously cannot understate how much we enjoyed the latkes made from this recipe. My husband even begged me to save the recipe so we could make it again next year too! NOTE: I do not recommend pairing latkes with guacamole. My husband had made some a few days prior and we needed to eat it before it went bad so we ended up serving our latkes with chips and guacamole on the side. It wasn't bad but it definitely didn't make anything better either.",

It is malted and therefore produces a crisp that lasts. NO other changes were made.",
