Last time the 2 boxes of pudding were way too much, so I tried only 1 this time and it was way too little. I had to use the other box. I think it is because this time I poked more holes in the cake and possibly didn't allow the pudding to sit as long, so it was less thick. Whatever the case, next time I'll make it just like the recipe and make sure to poke lots of holes into the cake. It was delicious!",
