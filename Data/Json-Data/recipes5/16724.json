I increased the cherries to 1 cup and reduced the choc chips to 1/2 cup. I love cherries. Keep a close eye when pre-baking the crust. I sometimes cook it a few extra minutes if it looks too soft. It shouldn't be brown just not look completely raw. I have made this many times trying other fruit/nut/choc combinations. It is great with white choc. I made a version with chopped apricot white choc and pecans it was very delicious but I did add a Tablespoon of white corn syrup as the topping looked a little dry. A great recipe to play with. My next try is with candied pineapple. I haven't decided which chips to use. Probably white but I think butterscotch might be nice as well.",
