I was actually surprised at how light the flavor was given that cilantro has such a strong taste. I ended up using 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to give it a little more zip. I served it with whole wheat spaghetti and really liked the way the flavor of the pesto worked with the nutty taste of the whole wheat. I'll definitely make this again.",
