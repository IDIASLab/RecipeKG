The allspice is great but definitely needs more - and that's after I added extra from the start! Pine nuts toast very nicely on the stove with no oil (they release their own natural oil). I made my own hummus and only used about 1.5 cups. Layered: hummus, pita, meat, pita, hummus, meat, pine nuts, parsley, paprika, lemon juice. Refrigerate leftovers and heat them up the next day - tastes just as good if not better! ~UPDATE~: after years of making this (to absolute rave reviews), I have changed the layering structure: hummus, meat, pita, hummus, meat, pine nuts. With only one layer of pita, it is a bit lighter. We LOVE this dish!",

I have made it both with ground beef and ground lamb - both are great. I triple the allspice every time. Depending on what I have I make it into a sort of salad - just put a torn pita on each plate top with hummus then the meat then either shredded romaine or halved cherry tomatoes (or both) then sliced red onion then parsley. Salt pepper paprika lemon juice. SO good! The pine nuts are tasty as well but I feel like you can easily skip them if you don't have them to hand. Enjoy!",
