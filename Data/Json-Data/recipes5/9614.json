I cooked my potatoes in a steamer basket inside a pressure cooker. This helped keep the potatoes drier. Also, I didn\u2019t pre-cook the gnocchi. I just put them directly into the pan, covered them in sauce, topped with extra cheese and baked. This way, the gnocchi are cooked, but stay intact. Definitely try this recipe.",
