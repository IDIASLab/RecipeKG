It had just the right amount of bite to tease the palate but certainly would not be classified as spicy.  Would definitely make this again.",

The soup was exactly what it was supposed to be but I didn't love the sweetness of the sweet potato in the soup. \"What exactly were you expecting\" you ask? \"When you make sweet potato soup\" you say \"it is supposed to taste like sweet potatoes\". Okay so it doesn't make sense but I still didn't love it. The soup had a nice texture and good sweet flavor but for me to really like it it would have needed to get a little more savory. The addition of sauteed onion or more chicken flavor might have saved it for me or maybe adding one regular potato to mellow it out but it was just too \"sweet potatoey\". I think I will stick to less assertive vegetables for my soups like butternut squash.",

I have made a few changes on occasion:  I leave out the cayenne (I never buy it, don't care for it).  Sometimes I use veggie broth instead of chicken, depending on what i have on hand.  Last time I added a bit of apple cider and it was also delicious.  Once in a while I change up the spices - I might add a bit of ginger and cinnamon, or even some curry.  As is or with any of those little changes, it always turns out great. Thanks!",
