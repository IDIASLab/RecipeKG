I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 2 tbl. packed brown sugar, 2 tsp. of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. salt (because I used unsalted butter) to the crust; next time I would add another 1/4 tsp. salt. I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the pecan filling mixture. I used a tablespoon to measure both the crust and the filling, and got 61 tablespoons of crust and 58 tablespoons of filling...not bad given the yield of 60 as stated in the recipe! I filled the remaining three crusts with leftover chopped pecans and brown sugar, and they turned out to be pretty yummy little pecan packets! I took a lot of time to form the crusts so that each one had a lip around the edge, and I had zero problems with filling escaping them. After trying, my family has requested that I make these for Thanksgiving!",

I took these to a party friends admitted that they were hesitant to sample these due to their appearance but upon tasting them they thought they were delicious. Several notable tips are: make sure that you FORM A SHELL with the dough (do not simply create a depression) - mold the dough into a shell-shape. Also if you use too much dough for the shell it may not cook thoroughly. I also advise baking the shells and once they are mostly done add the filling and continue baking (as recommended in the \"Butter Pecan Tartlets\" recipe from this site). I had also added about one tablespoon of brown sugar to the dough mixture; next time I will add more. I am currently rating this as 3 stars but if/when I try again I may revise my rating.",
