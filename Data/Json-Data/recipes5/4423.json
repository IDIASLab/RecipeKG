We usually eat out in New York but as we are summering in Maine there isn't anywhere around that serves it so I wanted to make it for him. However I was unable to find any butcher shop anywhere nearby that could cut the meat that thin. I ended up buying half a pound of filet mignon cut into 1/3\" slices and then I rolled it out on a cutting board with a rolling pin until it was thin enough to work for the recipe. He was pretty happy with the result! I also topped it with a tiny salad of baby arugula with a touch of parmesan and balsamic vinegar.",
