First time I made it as written and we had it for dinner over whole wheat couscous with a green salad on the side. The next evening DH said why don't we have it for lunch the next day! This time I used toasted sliced almonds instead of peanuts and added some chopped cilantro. Also I reduced the soy to just 1t. since we're both cutting back on salt. Anyway, it was great both ways, but I think I'm going to continue the cilantro addition because we both love that flavor. What a great keeper recipe!",

The only changes I made was that I used lime instead of lemon (I love lime with curry), and I didn't have distilled white vinegar, so I used seasoned rice vinegar. I also used light mayo (will try yogurt next time), added more red pepper flakes to match our tastes, and tossed in some lemon cucumbers and sugar snow peas from my garden. That's what's so great about this recipe - it's perfect as is, but it would work with chicken and any other veggies you prefer. A keeper, for sure. Thank you!",
