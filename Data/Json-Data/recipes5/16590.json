The biggest change I made was baking them in a tray for 25 mins before cutting them into bars rather than using the mix to make drop cookies. However I also used margerine instead of shortening reduced the sugar slightly didn't bother with the vanilla or salt & used some raisins & linseed as well as almost the full amount of choc chips. These had a nice nutty flavour without being overpowering. Will definately make again!",

Once they cool for several minutes they seem plenty moist and hold together fine. I made mine a little bigger (larger Pampered Chef cookie scoop size) so I just baked them for about 15 minutes until just dry on the top and lightly browned on the bottom. I used 1 cup butter & 1/2 cup \"no trans fat\" Crisco old fashioned oats and substituted 8 oz chopped dates for 1 cup of chocolate chips. Quite tasty.",
