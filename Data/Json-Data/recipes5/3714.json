We don't care for the taste of lemon pepper so I didn't use it and I also didn't have any parsley. I used lime juice instead of lemon. Since I had less salmon than the recipe called for I cut the juice/honey mixture in half. I won't do this next time so that I have plenty of liquid to baste the fish with while it's cooking. Thanks for an easy tasty way to prepare salmon!",
