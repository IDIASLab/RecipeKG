I am a big fan of the old fashioned deviled eggs, but this for a summer picnic or cook out is a great alternative to the origianl!...good job!\n\nps. if you use real from the farm eggs you will get a more deeper yellow/orange yolk...but if you use store bought as i did when i first made these, I added a touch of red or yellow food coloring to deeping the texture a bit on the filling. Also, be sure and use older eggs, not too fresh of eggs do to the fact that fresh eggs can tear off the white in chunks when peeled, and you will think you did not cook them long enough. Hope this helps!",

Even better.\nI also added a little chopped chives and\ngreen onion and dusted the tops with paprika.\nEDITED: I've made this deviled egg recipe many times now and every single time it turns out fantastic. This is also just as good with turkey bacon or pre-packaged bacon bits and I've found that this is wonderful with just about any cheese, especially white cheddar cheese or pepperjack. I like to add a little hot sauce to the filling as I'm mixing it, too. For easy piping, I used a ziploc bag that I spooned the filling into, then cut a corner out of the side of the bag. I just squeezed the egg filling carefully into the egg. When I'm finished, I just throw out the bag. \n\nNom. My husband and I fought over the last one. These are definetly making an \nappearance for my next holiday dinner.",

It worked REALLY well and crumbled better than the regular bacon, with less mess! (You may ahve to use more than 4 though as they are much smaller.) I also crushed an extra bacon slice into a fine pulp and sprinkled in on top of the eggs. For a decorative twist I put the yolk in a pastry bag and used a wide tip to put the filling in the whites instead of spooning them in like usual. I also used light mayo, lowfat cheddar and I didn't know if I was supposed to use powedered mustard or yellow mustard, I used the yellow mustard and it worked great and added color. ",

My personal tweakings: a tad more mayonnaise a squirt of ketchup 1/8 tsp. horseradish and 2 shakes of tabasco sauce. I used 18 eggs (1-1/2 dozen) to present to 8 women and when spread rather generously on 36 toasted triangles (9 slices of bread) and topped with a tiny slice of cherry tomato they simply disappeared!:) I personally attribute my \"pretty platter presentation\" with the success of this recipe but more than likely the BACON (and 2 T. of bacon drippings which I added to the mixture) may have had something to do with it too:). I will DEFINITELY make this again.",
