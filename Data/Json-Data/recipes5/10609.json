The longer I thought about this today I just knew I had to make it as I knew the men in my family would love. Well I was correct. It says: \"Spread tastes best when refrigerated overnight to blend flavors but it can be served right away if needed.\" Well it wasn't needed right away but that didn't stop my DH from chowing down with a few pretzels. I took a bowl out to my dad and he liked it also. I told them both to wait until tomorrow or Sunday (Super Bowl) and it would taste even better. I'm taking a larger bowl down to my son in Tennessee to enjoy and I have no doubt he will like it also. I used a Yuengling Amber Beer for the flavoring. Can't wait to give this cheese dip a try on Sunday! (Super Bowl XLIX (49) New England Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks)",

If you want those....well there are recipes for that, go find one. Having said that, this dip has a wonderful flavor! You really, really do want to leave it overnight. The cheese flavor gets a little of its own back overnight and the beer flavor mellows out.  Basically, after a night in the fridge, the flavor is spot on.  If you eat it right away, be prepared for it to taste mostly like beer.   I usually use a lager or pilsner....sometimes a light brown beer even.  I let it come to room temperature and serve it with fresh, soft pretzels. There is never anything at all left over.",

I used a Bud Light that was gathering dust in my fridge, but I think I'll try a Sam Adams next just to see what will happen.  The best part is, the day after (when we were hungover on the couch), my guy surprised me by making a grilled cheese for me using this spread and copious amounts of pepperjack.
