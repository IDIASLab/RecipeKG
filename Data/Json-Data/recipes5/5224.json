They fell apart despite my tactics to hold them together. I also made them too big which contributed to the falling-apart situation. Next time I'll zing them up more with some deeper flavors (maybe curry) and I'll probably shred onion and zucchini and add them. I'll also cook them in a pan as directed and try not to be so clever. All in all great recipe for a weeknight that uses ingredients I had on hand.",
