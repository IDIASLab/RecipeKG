I soak an untreated cedar plank in water and bourbon while they are out fishing for the day and fix the barbeque sauce so that's it is ready to get grilling.....",

AND I used it to glaze the fish about three times while cooking so there was no need to serve any extra sauce on top at the table. My four year old LOVED it. He's my favorite and most honest critic.
