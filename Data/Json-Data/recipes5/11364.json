The curry flavor adds a lot of interest and is the star and it indeed shines! The potato did a great job adding texture and thickening. Served today with a scoop of tuna salad on lettuce along with fresh sliced tomatoes hard boiled egg slices and crackers Since this is pureed I also can see this served cold as an appetizer in a small bowl. Thanks for sharing your recipe it gets a thumbs up in this house.",
