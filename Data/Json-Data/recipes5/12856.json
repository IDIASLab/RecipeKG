My mom adds some hot pepper paste to the mixture to give it a kick. It's mainly made as a snack and for gatherings. It's as popular as serving chips at a party. You don't have to add all those ingredients mentioned. Might be too much. Make what you'd like. I recommend carrots, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. (slice carrot and cucumber really thin, like spaghetti 2 inches in length) To make sure the middle is cooked, push the middle with the back of your spatula to flatten it out.",
