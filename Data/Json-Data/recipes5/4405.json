Crunchy chewy savory sweet; fresh & dried; raw and cooked; robust yet light... This salad literally has it all! I made this three times in ten days for gatherings of 20 people easily adjusting the ingredient amounts with the servings calculator. Everyone commented on how good it was and sought me out for the recipe intrigued by the ingredients. I added an ear of fresh raw corn cut off the cob and used Greek yoghurt in the dressing. Even two days after adding the dressing the salad still tasted fabulous and fresh! I don't think you could hurt this recipe by utilizing any number of ingredients you may have on hand. I put in only half the amount of almonds because it seemed like too much. I rarely use muenster cheese and was impressed by its mild and creamy contribution to the medley.
