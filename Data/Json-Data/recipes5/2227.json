And other than that there just wasn't much flavor. This needs some onion herbs less bacon and more seasoning. I added some bacon to the sauce at the end and saved some for garnishing. I also wouldn't put the cherry tomatoes in at the beginning of making the sauce either. Put them in at the end for better flavor. This recipe needs a bit of help in the flavor department.",
