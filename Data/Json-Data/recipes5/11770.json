The second time I cooked it it was Christmas dinner for fourteen people so I made some modifications. I doubled the rice left out the celery and mushrooms used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of three;I used two cans of cream of celery two cans cream of mushroom one can cream of chicken. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper. Since I don't like chicken breast I boiled deboned and cut up six drumsticks and threw it in. Everyone loved it including my finicky 18-year-old nephew who even asked to take some home!",
