The combination of creamy sour cream buttery smooth avocado and smoky bacon was just out of this world. Whether eaten on its own as a salad or served in tacos you will not be disappointed. This will be my new guacamole and because of this recipe we will be eating a lot more avocados. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

I used low fat sour cream and fresh lime juice instead of lemon.  As suggested by another cook I made up the lime/sour cream sauce earlier in the day so that the flavors could mingle and \"get happy\". About 30 min before serving it I cubed up the avocados and mixed them in.  HOWEVER.. I served this at my burrito bar dinner and it was inhaled!  What wasn't slathered into the pulled pork burritos was eaten as a heavenly chunky dip with chips.  Not one drop was left over... :)  Next time I'll try a little fresh Cilantro...then it will be 6 stars...",

When it comes to regular guacamole less ingredients are better but the avocados must be very ripe or it will lack flavor and creamy consistency. This salad is excellent but especially good if your avocados are a touch underripe for standard guacamole. I added a clove of garlic and substituted key lime juice for lemon. Key lime is tarter than regular lime and gives it a unique flavor. I would even suggest regular Persian lime instead of lemon in this recipe. Overall excellent as a dip or even condiment to tacos or fajitas.",

What a pretty presentation this salad makes & I think it would be even nicer with romaine. I mixed all of the dressing ingredients together (minus the avocados) and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before serving. Just before dinner I then chopped up the avocados and very gently folded them into the sour cream mixture. My dad RAVED about this salad and said about 5 times how good it was; he never ever does that! Thanks TXG for such a simple & tasty recipe!!! I plan on making this often.:)",
