I then add pressed roasted garlic.  Don't worry about the left over larger pieces that are in the press.  The hand held mixer will beat it up.  Added a few minches of salt.  Then I added 3 tablespoons of marjorine.  Blend it well.  Last but not least I added a tablespoon of garlic spread marjorine.  OMG it was to die for!!!  WOW all around!!",

                "reviewBody": "First let me tell you what I didn't like about this recipe.  It tells you to cook the potatoes until \"tender, but firm.\"  What does that mean???  It's not like I can reach my hand in a pot of simmer water and feel the potatoes!  So I guestimated 20 minutes.  It came out a little mushier than I like it, so I think a time range would have helped.  Also, there's not enough garlic cloves.  Not much garlic flavor to this garlic mashed potatoes.  I recommend doubling the garlic...probaly a whole head.  Also, 45 minutes cooking in olive oil is too much.  Cooked all the flavor away!  I think about 25 minutes would have sufficed.  And that's why I'm only giving it 4 out of 5 stars.  Now onto the good stuff.  I added 4 oz of cream cheese to the mix too to give it an extra creamy flavor and texture and cut back a little on the milk.  I also added some garlic salt (about a tablespoon) to compensate for the nonexistent garlic flavor.  I also spooned it into a baking dish, topped it with cheddar cheese and paprika and baked it for about 15 minutes on 350 degrees.  It came out pretty well after I compensated for the overdone potatoes and the nonexistent garlic flavor.",

I then roasted the garlic for a half an hour at 350. I used twice the amount of butter and twice the Parmesean. I squeezed the entire head of garlic into the mash, and viola! Deliciousness.",

Make sure you buy the larger garlic bulbs if you are looking for more garlic flavor, and maybe leave the skins on 1/2 of the potatoes as the previous reviewer suggested.  I put these in my crockpot to keep them warm and they were the perfect consistancy.  I got rave reviews on these!  Thanks Barrett!",

                "reviewBody": "I know this is supposed to be an easy recipe but I am a little confused by the garlic part. I wonder if it was meant to have a little burnt taste/smell. Mine turned out a little dark brown half way through the cooking time. We dont like the taste of burnt garlic so i squeezed out as much of the soft stuff. When I roast garlic I usually use the whole bulb of garlic leaving the first layer of skin on and cut 1/4 at the end place in remiken drizzle olive oil then cover with foil. Maybe next time I will use this method for the individual gloves leaving the skins on. When cooled squeeze out the soft garlic. Now let's get with the whole result...it was bland and had to add more butter a little more shakes of salt and used more heavy cream. With little tweaks you got a winner.",
