        "description": "I get bored of regular red sauce meatloaf. I've combined my version of holiday stuffing and turned it into a meatloaf. This alternative is delicious and full of veggies and apples. Instead of using bread crumbs, crackers, or oatmeal, try Pepperidge Farm&reg; Herb Seasoned Stuffing! Perfect for fall-winter comfort-style dinners. Pairs well with traditional mashed potatoes and dinner rolls. After experimenting several times over the course of a few years, I've come up with what I call 'Meatloaf Stuffing'. You can use ground beef if meatloaf meat is not available. Enjoy!",

I used a cornbread stuffing, and cooked my hamburger meat before mixing all the ingredients. If you don't have an hour+ time to cook that cuts your cooking time in half. If you let it cool down a bit after taking it out of the oven it still holds together like a meatloaf if your wanton to serve it on a platter. If not like us, we just scoop it out and it was great :) thank you!",

I didn\u2019t have all ingredients. I used two pounds of chop meat minced onion,garlic powder,salt,and black pepper. I used corn bread stuffing . I also used cream of mushroom soup however my pot has a drip strip for the oil. So instead of putting it on the bottom I put it on top about 20 minutes before it was done. It came out delicious we even had it the next night again. Next time I will use all ingredients and see the difference. Thankyou for this recipe. Any suggestions will be appreciated.",

I used the whole can of mushroom soup but probably should have used on 2/3 since I had less ground meat in the recipe. Otherwise I scaled all of the other ingredients down by one third. It didn't brown and we weren't impressed. I won't be making it again.",

I cut it small, too and I love onion. Maybe I will use minced dried onion next time. Also, I loved the cream of mushroom soup addition. I didn't add water, just some milk. I also just used hamburg, that's what I had on hand. So good with mashed potatoes, salad and french cut green beans.",
