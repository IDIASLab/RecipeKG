I cooked it on a low heat & it took approx 2 hrs & checking frequently & stirring because there is very little liquid & it sticks very easily to the pot. Also I did add another heaping tsp of the red curry paste & this def. improved the flavor. Before I added it the taste was pleasant but did not have any zip to it & I like a little zip. Note: The Red Curry Paste I used was a Thai curry paste & NOT Indian curry paste big diff. In the end with this change to the recipe it turned out delicious. Loved it. Next up is a recipe is a true East Indian recipe.",

I added a little salt when putting in the lentils instead of waiting until the end to season and I used a heaping tablespoon of yellow curry paste. The boyfriend is a recovering vegetarian so I like to occasionally make meatless recipes that are hearty tasty and satisfy both of us. I served this over Jasmine Rice with a side of Naan. Thank you for the recipe will definitely make again!",
