I used with boneless skinless chicken breats.  I added the marinade before freezing and then thawed over night in the fridge.  I did not over cook the chicken as my instant read thermometer only read 180, but it was very dry.  I noticed when I placed it on the grill that the marinade had already started to cook the outside of the chicken.  I think the acid content with the lemon juice and vinegar may have been too high for the boneless chicken breast.  If I use again I would really like to marinade a whole chicken in this before baking.  I think that the larger bird may be better equiped to deal with the acid content.",

He didn't have a scrap left on his plate. We used it with boneless chicken breasts and they were moist to the point they fell apart. Brushing the marinade on while grilling helps keep chicken moist. A good hint for this recipe for those who think its too much lemon use apple cider vinegar. To add a little extra flavor you can also brush some marinade on before you eat it. I will definately do this again and recommend this to everyone I know.",
