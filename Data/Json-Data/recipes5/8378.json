I also added a bit more honey and heated it a bit with peanut butter to make it more liquid and easier to mix with dry ingredients.

I added 1T of vanilla and 1T of cocoa powder also to bump up some flavour since my protein powder is flavourless. Mine didn't turn out crumbly but they are crunchy.

I add 1/3 cup of wheat germ, 1/3 cup of ground flax seed, ram it full of chopped almonds, two eggs, vanilla and double the honey. I add apples sauce if I have it but not required, these taste great. Once cut up, I freeze the entire batch in a large freezer bag and pick one out a day, they don't last long in the house because the kids love them also. Thanks for the recipe!!",
