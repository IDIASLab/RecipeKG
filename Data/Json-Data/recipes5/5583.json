The breading adds a lot of flavor that reminded me of pizza crust and its texture has a little crunch to it.  Then with the sauce, pepperoni and cheese added on, it just got better with each layer. Next time I make it for dinner I plan on adding a few more of our favorite pizza toppings to our chicken.",
