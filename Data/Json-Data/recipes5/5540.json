And the dry rub had cinnamon nutmeg and cloves which seemed a bit unusual. That said I followed the recipe faithfully and it was very good. I trimmed the brisket by hand once I had it home so much of the excess fat was gone. Also I did sear the meat with dry rub in a cast iron skillet 2 minutes / side and I think that is an important part of the recipe. The process forms a crust on the meat. I extended the cook time an hour - so a total of five hours and for the last hour I removed the cover. The result was a flavorful fork tender brisket that everyone enjoyed.",

I did not add the carrots, celery, or lemon juice but it came out wonderful. I had a huge brisket so I ended up cutting it in half and putting half in the slow cooker and half in the oven in the pampered chef deep covered baker. The one in the baker was better but both were good. Even with how much meat I had there was enough of the rub. The meat just fell apart when we went to cut it. This was fine because we server it over rice. I am going to try this again with a beef roast tonight. This is a great dish. The left overs were good as left overs but not as good as the first night. Sorry I did not take photos of it. Next time I make it as a brisket I'll take photos.",
