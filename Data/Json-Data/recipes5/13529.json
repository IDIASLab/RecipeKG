Those that love garlic and basil will like these and they were a nice change of pace from the normal beef burger. The garlic was very strong in it and I wish I had used garlic powder instead of fresh. I only used 1 serving of egg beaters, mixed the rest per the recipe and refrigerated for 2 hrs prior to grilling.  The burgers held their shape fine.  Just a general tip, when mixing any type of burgers with add ins (like onions or liquids), refrigerate the mixture a few hours prior to shaping and cooking.  This not only lets the flavors blend together, it also helps the burgers retain their shape.",
