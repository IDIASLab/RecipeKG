Those who prefer a sweeter-tasting pie may want to increase the amount of sugar substitute blend that's used. Remember the brown sugar blend does have sugar, so diabetics will need to watch how much is added.",

I used about 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I made my own spice blend of cinnamon ginger nutmeg mace and I forgot the cloves but it still turned out great! Warning: when I mixed it up I thought it was too runny. In fact it made too much mix and I had to dump some of it out so it would fit in the pie pan. I may try cutting back on the evaporated milk (maybe using 1/2 the can) next time. It baked well though: I did the first 30 minutes uncovered then draped a piece of foil over it. I think I ended up cooking it another 30 minutes before I took it out. It still wasn't quite set but it set while it rested. My pie crust was a standard recipe that I use for all of my pies (I got it from The Pioneer Woman's blog her Pam's Pie Tutorial).",
