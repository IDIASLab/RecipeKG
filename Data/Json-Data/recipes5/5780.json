Really great combo of flavors and the dressing was just right IMO. I did use the optional ground sumac. I did not have Greek seasoning on hand so I just used Italian seasoning (I know it's NOT the same) but it worked well. Also I didn't measure any of the salad ingredients just eyeballed everything. This was a huge hit tonight and a definite keeper YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
