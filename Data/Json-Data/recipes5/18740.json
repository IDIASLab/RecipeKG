I subbed canola oil for vegetable oil, 1 cup of all purpose flour in place of 2 cups of wheat flour. For some who may not know rolled oats are old-fashioned oats, not quick cooking. Finally, I added 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed.  The batter was very thick, filled my paper liners 3/4's of the way full.  My muffins cooked in 20 minutes and I got 14 muffins.  Next time I will try applesauce in place of the oil and maybe a handful of chopped walnuts.",

I followed GodivaGirl's lead and cut back on the flour as she thought it was too thick. I did half a cup of wheat and half a cup of white. I added in a half teaspoon of salt and a little bit of nutmeg. End result was a moist flavorful banana muffin. I think if I were to make these again some chopped walnuts would make these perfection. Super fast to throw together tonight as to have less of a hassle for Sunday breakfast. I plan on pairing it with a fresh fruit salad.",

This may sound strange especially since there is no butter in this recipe but the mixture of ingredients comes together to give the muffins a rich deep almost buttery flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and the muffins did seem a little dry at first. (If we were to eat them the day they were made I'd probably add 2 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce for more moisture.) I tend to refrigerate the muffins and we eat them over the course of a week. This works really well since this gives the spices a chance to develop depth of flavor and the moisture of the bananas develops as well. This is a great recipe!",
