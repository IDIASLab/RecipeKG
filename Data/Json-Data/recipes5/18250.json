Also, I just mixed the cornstarch in with the brown sugar mixture, with no additional water, and cooked the apples until tender and the juices had thickened, then added a little vanilla. After filling and closing the turnovers, I secured the edges by pressing them with a fork, and slit a steam vent in the top. A fantastic bakery-style dessert just doesn't get any easier than this!

Pepperidge Farm pastry already comes in square sheets, so all you have to do is quarter them with a pizza cutter. Probably the most time-consuming bit is peeling and slicing the apples. Next time I will only use 3 apples and reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup, because we had leftovers--although I'm not complaining, they were delish. You can use apple pie filling if you want, but the crispiness of the sauteed fruit can only come from fresh apples. I cooked my apples a little longer and shortened the baking time since they were browned after 20 minutes. I crimped the edges with a fork when I closed them up--don't worry if a little sauce spills out. (Feel free to add another teaspoon or two of cornstarch/water if your sauce is not thick enough.) They looked like they were store bought but tasted better.",

Also, don't really need all the brown sugar, 1/2 or 3/4 is more than enough. Sprinkle some granulated on the egg wash if you want more sweetness. Also don't need glaze--sweet enough. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper for no pan clean up!",
