I was a bit worried as it doesn't have that creamy factor that frosting has but let me tell you I'm glad I tried it! Everyone loved it. Some did think it was a bit sweet although I decreased the sugar a bit but other than that I was pleasantly surprised that it was such a hit. Especially that it looked more like melted cheese on top instead of coconut!It is a nice change from the regular frosting and quite original of a technique! Thanks for sharing it really helped me out!:)",
