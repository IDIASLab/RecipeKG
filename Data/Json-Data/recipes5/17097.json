I boiled for a while and probably went over 10 mins and let them sit a little over an hour.  I just took my time about it. I started the crockpot at 12:30 on High and the beans were perfect by 4:30.  Right amount of sauce too and never added more water.  I still stayed casual and finished the recipe with the final steps and ingreds and went another hour on low for fear I've over cook them.  These are professonal, afordable, and gormet-looking and tasting!  This recipe is what your teen boys will brag to their future wives about!  No can will ever compare.  These are a wow!

I think we all need to remember that our crock pots are different heat and different ages. So cook until yours are done. I had some leftover ham last time and did not use the ham hocks just added the ham chuncked at the beginning. I do use Heinz Cocktail Sauce instead of plain Ketchup and a nice deli brown mustard. Gives it great flavor. I have made these three times now and Love them! I even use low calorie maple syrup because that is what I have in the house.",

I started this recipe in the early evening by boiling the rinsed beans on the stove then transfered them (with original water) into the crockpot.  My father has always insisted you never throw away the water you cook your beans in.\n\nI used bacon instead of hamhocks and I added 4 garlic cloves.  I think my quantity of beans was close to 4 or 5 cups, all said, my 1 gallon crockpot was full to the lid. \n\nI cooked them on high until I went to bed.  I had to watch my water level in the first few hours and did fine just adding more as needed.  I cannot imagine this recipe working with the prescribed amount!\n\nThe beans were ready the following evening.  They totally hit the spot for us particularly since we cannot get canned baked beans here.  I had been craving Bush's baked beans for weeks and these definitely worked.  Now if only we could find some kielbasa, LOL!",

I didn't read the whole recipe and added the ketchup and mustard at the beginning. Opps it took over 7 hours for the beans to be fully cooked even though I soaked them overnight. Make sure you add enough water to the beans if soaking them overnight. I didn't and the next morning there was almost none. That might have effected the cooking time the next day. Leave a couple inches of extra water on top of the beans. Th two pork hocks I used were big and I was surprised how much meat I was able to get off them. The meat just fell off. When the beans were finally cooked I added the same amount of ketchup and mustard again and some water because it was way too thick. Cooked another 30 mins. and it was done. Froze all of it for lunches. So thanks for the recipe. Grab the Beano and enjoy!!!! Michele Cambridge ontario",
