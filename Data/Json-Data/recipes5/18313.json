And next time I'll reduce the water to only 1 cup. Due to the volume of water (combined with the ham juices and the syrup runoff) the ham was literally boiling in deep liquid toward the end when I went to baste it. I won't use cloves anymore since they only flavored the ham immediately surrounding each one and they are bitter when accidently bitten into (they are small and easy to overlook). Flavor was good would probably be much better with a thickened syrup which remains on the ham instead of running off.",

I preped up the ham as directed (pineapple and cloves) and poured half the maple syrup brown sugar honey and butter mixture over the ham but ended up basting it with the pan juices which was the water and suryp mix and only basted a few times at that. Next time I will follow directions verbatum and even though I got plenty of compliments today I'm sure I'll get a lot more then.",
