I also use 1 egg and 2 egg whites instead of 3 eggs. Since I don't usually have buttermilk I use soured milk (add tbs lemon juice or vinegar to your milk). I gradually add the liquid until the batter is the right consistency since it tends to be thin. I throw in a tbs or two of ground flax seed for a little added nutrition. I usually double this recipe and freeze the extras. They warm up great in the toaster. They're also great if you add blueberries.",

I didn't measure any of the ingredients directly (I ususlly go by 'feel' when cooking). Because of this I wasn't too concerned about the fact that baking soda was missing from the ingredients list but was called for in the body of the recipe... If you want to make this recipe and you are going to use buttermilk do not forget to use the baking soda! I think I put about a 3/4\" of a teaspoon in. I also didn't have any buttermilk but I found that if you put about 2tsp of regular vinegar in whole or 2% milk it will cause the milk to curdle slightly and will closely resemble buttermilk. (By the way you can't even begin to taste the vinegar in the final pancakes after baking.) I've added this recipe to my box and will now make it my mainstay for making pancakes!",

The batter is quite thick and I found they were harder to flip being so heavy. All of the butter made them greasier than I like but the butter flavor was very good. I sprayed my griddle with cooking spray knowing these already had so much butter. I followed the recipe exactly although my son wanted chocolate chips in his and I used white whole wheat flour. My son wasn't crazy about these at all. I liked the flavor but they were just too greasy and dense. I do think these could be great with some changes though. I am going to experiment with canola oil and applesauce next time and just put a little butter on top of the finished pancake for flavor. I will also substitute some of the buttermilk for skim milk and see if this helps. If you want a very filling pancake these will really stick by you and I love the use of whole wheat flour and wheat germ.",
