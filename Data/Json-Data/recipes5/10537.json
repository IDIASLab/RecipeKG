Bought the veggies at Pike Place Market and made this as a special treat for my girlfriend--it was her first day at a new job. Was surprised the summer squash didn't disintegrate after 30 minutes of simmering but it was a-ok...nice and chunky and hearty. While the stew was simmering we had a little caprese-style salad--sliced heirloom tomatoes with fresh basil, balsamic vinegar, and oil on top. Altogether it was an easy dinner that won me major points!",

There is a lot of chopping with this recipe and I recommend you get everything cut up before you start cooking. I do not have the the knife skills a pro has so it takes me an hour to get everything chopped and sliced. But the result is well worth the effort. Enjoy. FYI - Use your large stew pot because this make a lot more than 4 servings. In my opinion it makes 8 to 10 servings.",
