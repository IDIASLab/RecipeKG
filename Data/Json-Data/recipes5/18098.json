I also always preheat my muffin oven to 500 degrees and then turn to the baking heat when I put them in. Particularly with the whole grain products this gets them crisp while the leavening has made them fluffy and puffy. People who say this is dry or not sweet enough are probably overcooking them. Using applesauce or vinegar-milk in lieu of apple or buttermilk will also decrease the sweetness tremendously and cause them to be drier.",

I used whole wheat flour and I also increased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 (the weight watchers points is still 1 even with the extra sugar!). They were pleasantly sweet although I could probably get away with using 1/3 cup. I also added some cinnamon and used a whole apple chopped with the peel on istead of just a half. The extra amount of apple made these terrific! Next time I think I'll add a pinch of salt. I individually wrapped these and stuck them in my freezer so I'm interested to see how they hold up!
