I've had many a Shoofly Pie before. This is the most authentic in flavor that I've ever tasted. God Bless her for sharing it with us. Serve this pie with homemade vanilla bean ice cream and a hot cup of coffee or tea, snuggled up by the fireplace with someone you love. It's like going to heaven, yet it's a devilish good time.",

I have given it 4 stars because it sounds delicious (and I had to rate it in order to get publish my question)and I will try it without the second layer of chips.",
