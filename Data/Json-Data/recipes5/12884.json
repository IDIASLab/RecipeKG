Threw in some jalape\u00f1os, scallion, roasted peppers, spinach, on top of bacon and saut\u00e9ed another 5 minutes.  \n\nSprayed an 8\" round casserole, dumped in the tater tots on the bottom.  Combined the egg mixture with the meat and veggies and poured on top.  Whisked up 2 more eggs and poured on top.  \n\nBaked about 55 minutes, just until the egg didn't run when I put a fork in the center.  Tasted great, definitely not bland.",
