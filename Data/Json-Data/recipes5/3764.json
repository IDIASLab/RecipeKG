All I can say is that it was easy to make (although a bit time consuming), and a huge hit!!! Everyone FLIPPED for the bean salad and it flew off the table.  Now this item is a must have.  Its light and great for the summer. To make the salad more colorful, I used all different kinds of beans instead of just garbanzos. Enjoy!",

I adapted it as follows: (1) Halved the recipe; (2) Did not use onion; (3) Added an extra splash of lemon juice and vinegar (and used cider vinegar; didn't have white-wine); (4) 1/4 heaping teaspoon of ground ginger (didn't have fresh) a little extra cumin and only a pinch of cayenne; (5) substituted one can of chickpeas for a can of rinsed black beans - was low on chickpeas; and finally (6) added some sliced meaty green olives marinated in olive oil only from an Armenian store.
