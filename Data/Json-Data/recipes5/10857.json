Didn't have any milk or yogurt on hand so I used sour cream instead. Since it was just me I cut up just one acorn squash then used all the stuffing to over stuff both halves. Cooking time took a little longer than expected but that may just be my oven or possibly because they were overstuffed (the top of the acorn squash was completely covered in sausage). Don't make the mistake of under cooking... you will know when they are done by the incredible aroma that fills your home. Do NOT skip the cinnamon and mint. The combination of hot sausage spices sweet acorn squash and long cooking time turned this into a mildly hot incredibly flavorful meal all by itself.",
