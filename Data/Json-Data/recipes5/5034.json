The original sandwiches are made from meat that is pressed into a loaf and grilled on a rotating spit. The meat is shaved off as it gets crispy and then put into a pita sandwich. My recipe calls for thin slices of meat to be marinated and then broiled to get the same effect without a huge rotating grill. Serve in a warmed pita with goat cheese, tzatziki sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pepperoncinis.",

I sliced the flank steak when it was still partially frozen so I coulld get it very thin (~1/8\" slice), and dried with paper towels right before broiling to get a nice sear. The tzatziki sauce was very good as well. This is a simple meal and results may vary if the ingredients are not high quality. I used Kronoz brand pitas from the regular grocery store and they were very good. I did change one thing, which is I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. You can do this with every recipe so long as it is not going to be cooked. Sour cream is not likely to separate the way yogurt can when heated.",

I hesitated before throwing out the marinade, added a bit more olive oil, then put it in a pot and boiled it for a good 15 or 20 minutes to make it safe to eat, then added about a tsp of sugar and cooked until the onions caramelized. I smeared this on the pita before adding the other ingredients. Wow, just wow. The tzatziki sauce was yummy too, except I only had dried dill weed so I used 1/3 of the amount called for.  I will use smaller pitas next time, I think the ones I had were just a bit too big. Thanks for the great recipe!",
