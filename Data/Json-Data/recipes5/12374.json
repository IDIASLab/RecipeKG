I also noticed one person mentioned it didn't set. There is a trick. You have to whip it really well. Also, really cool things happen when you add lemon/lime juice to sweetened condensed milk.

After that this recipe took 10 minutes top to put together. Obviously it still had to chill but I don't mind recipes where you make it then let it sit--it helps me with my time management to make things ahead anyway. I followed some reviewer's suggestions to double the cream cheese which worked well enough. Until I went to fill my pie crust. 16 oz is a LOT and I couldn't put it all in the pie crust--as it was I ended up using most of it but skimping on the pie filling since I'd already put the cream cheese in. I was using a store bought pie crust but be prepared for leftover cream cheese mixture if you double it and have a small pie pan. It didn't faze me for long though: I made little cheesecake trifles with the rest of the mixture some of the pie filling blueberries and topped with a cherry. It was very pretty and very good. I had absolutely no issues with this setting--it was definitely firm after less than 2 hours. I did make sure to mix the cream cheese and condensed milk very well then mixed very well again after adding the lemon juice. This made bf very happy--he loves cheesecake. Thanks for the recipe!",
