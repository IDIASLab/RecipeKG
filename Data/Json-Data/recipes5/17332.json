I let the ribs cook on low for about 8-10 hours.  Then I place them in the oven on a baking sheet for a half hour so that the sauce caramelizes onto the meat.  It works every time!",

For this, it deserves 5 stars!! Use any sauce (I like 1 C. ketchup, 1 C. Stubb's barbecue sauce, 2 T. brown sugar, 1 t. Worcestershire, and Tabasco hot sauce to taste.) The original sauce recipe (which I've tried) isn't sharp or hot enough for our tastes. We use boneless beef chuck country ribs, 2 lbs. or more. Stir once during cooking time so ribs don't stick to sides and burn. To thicken sauce a bit, put the crockpot on High, with the lid ajar, during the last half hour.  WONDERFUL!",

Do not make this recipe because if you read all of the reviews, no one actually made it by the recipe! Everyone changed it to BBQ sauce..so they should not have rated it higher than a star or two. No one hwo made it by recipe liked it. Just slow cook in your favorite bbq sauce, you will be 100% happier! But slow cooking th emeat that long is FABULOUS.",

I followed other reviewers' advice and substituted bbq sauce for the ketchup, (2 cups) and ketchup for the chili sauce. (1 cup) I cut back on the vinegar to 2 1/2 Tbsp. just because I thought 4 Tbsp. was a lot. I also left out the hot sauce, simply because I didn't have any on hand. I used boneless Country Style Ribs. I couldn't get them out of the crock pot in one piece, they were soo tender! Thank you so much for this recipe, it is definitely one of the BEST on this site!!!

FIRST, do not ignore the baking in the oven first b/c it removed 1/2\" of fat juice in a 9X13 pan!!!  THEN, it was hard to decide what sauce to follow since there were a lot of choices suggested, so I went to the most reliable (top rated on the site) called Sylvia's Ribs b/c why ruin perfect ribs?! Basically, dump 2C ketchup, 1C bbq 1C brown sugar, 2.5T lemon juice, 2t Worcestershire, several dashes of hot pepper, 3T steak sauce, cloves garlic ...directly into crockpot.  LASTLY, most of the sauces used will be thin in the end, so definitely take out and put in oven at 375 for 20 min to caramelize the sauce onto the ribs (make sure ribs are covered in sauce when you put in oven).  These were perfect!  You will be a hero if you have a house full of men like me.",

If you just dumped a bottle of barbeque sauce into the slow cooker instead of following the recipe to at least some degree, you really have no reason to write a review. Trust me, this sauce tastes nothing like KC Masterpiece, all you really did was look at this to find out how long to cook them. Why waste our time with a completely unhelpful review?",
