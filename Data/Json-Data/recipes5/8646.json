I ended up deciding on beef tri-tip, since it's affordable, flavorful, great for parties, and, using this low-temp roasting technique, nearly fool-proof. No marinating, no searing, no nothing; just rub on some salt and spices and pop it into the oven until it reaches the doneness you want. Plate it up with a Romano bean salad or enjoy as a roast beef sandwich!",

We ended up rinsing it off and throwing it on the grill for leftover sandwiches tomorrow. Also, the smoked paprika was too much smoke leaving a bitter flavor which was the only thing we could taste through the salt. Reduce the salt if you want to try this recipe. Also, we like medium rare but this was warmed raw with a brown exterior at just over 130 degrees before taking it out to rest covered for 20 minutes.",
