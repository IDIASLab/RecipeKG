I cut the potatoes each into 8-10 potato wedges, and they did still take the full 40 minutes. And, I baked them on a foil lined sheet. I did half the recipe and it fit the whole baking sheet. I would say the full recipe would be more like 6 servings though. Interesting recipe! And, I wonder if my grandpa ate a french fry like these in the the Navy in WWII? Happy Veterans's Day though!
