You're not going to be able to \"chop\" your tomatoes once their broiled because they basically turn to mush but don't fret they're still yummy. If you want a chunkier salsa I suggest chopping up a couple fresh tomatoes without broiling them. As for the actual taste of this salsa it's just \"alright\" for me. I am not a cilantro fan but my boyfriend & roommate are and they enjoyed it very much. Too much cilantro for me and I didn't even use the entire half cup it calls for. I also roasted up a jalapeno for more heat.",
