I used grapes instead of raisins left out the carrots used slivered almonds instead of toasted cashews and I didn't have any garam masala on hand so skipped that entirely. I also went a bit heavy with the curry powder because I love the taste of it and added a squeeze of lemon to the yogurt dressing. It turned out delicious! I will definitely be making this again.",
