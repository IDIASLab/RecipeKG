        "description": "This is a recipe my grandmother brought with her from Trieste. It is an alternative to baked artichokes that also uses the tasty meat even from tough leaves. As kids we always thought it was fun to eat! Serve in bowls with crusty Italian bread. Artichoke leaves will be soft near the yellow bottom but still tough near the tip. Pick tough leaves out of your bowl with your fingers and nibble the soft part from the bottom. Then drag the leaf over your bottom teeth to get the artichoke meat.",
