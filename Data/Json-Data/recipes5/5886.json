I hadn't planned on making this and was able to put it together in no time and it cooks quite fast. If you happen to already have puff pastry in your fridge or freezer then it really is a quick dessert to throw together.  I had issues with the amount of puff pastry versus the other ingredients though. Obviously one sheet of puff pastry in Canada is 450g (found out after I had started this recipe). Instead, I had a 250g puff pastry so I halved the amount of the other ingredients. I used 2 apples that weighed a total of 400 grams (once peeled and cored). The result was a bit dry. The last 8 minutes in the oven I spread a thin layer of cranberry jam on top, but of course it changed the color and flavour somewhat; I didn't have any light coloured jam on hand. The next time I will use a larger pastry surface so I can get the pastry to fold around it like a galette should. Also, I will definitely use a gelatine or light coloured jam on top to give it some moisture and shine. Thanks Liam Walshe for a very fast and easy, yet elegant solution for my mid aftenoon tea. Your recipe made my daughter's day!",

The problem I had was the apples didn\u2019t cook all the way and stayed slightly crunchy even thigh I cooked them all the way. Because of that I don\u2019t think you got the same gooey filling like you do on a pie. Also, plan on serving shortly after making because once it sits the puff pastry becomes a little soggy. It was quick and easy to put together.",
