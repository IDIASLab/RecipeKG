And I don't know why I thought adding sugar would be a good idea to try! I always put the beef in a colander and rinse with hot water before adding to the gravy, it cuts the salt a bit. Add some black pepper and that's all the seasoning you need. I'll stick to my tried and true SOS recipe from now on thanks.",
