First, I omitted the bacon, as I follow a pescetarian diet.   I also added mixed, sliced mushrooms (cremini, shittake, oyster, portabello) during the step where you add the celery, then cooked for 5 minutes before the next step.  I love mushrooms, as they help to add earthiness when you have to omit meat from a recipe.   ***Advice to those wondering about reheating:  this worked AMAZING for me, as  I was cooking it only for myself and knew I'd be eating it over several days: Make the chowder, but stop right before adding the scallops.  Portion out the amount you aren't eating that day, Cool and refrigerate. Finish the recipe for the part you want to eat right then. When you want to eat the remainder of the chowder, heat the scallop-less chowder on the stovetop. When it starts to simmer, add your scallops, cook for 2 minutes, and done! Finish off with your lemon zest and tarragon.  It actually tasted better in subsequent days, as most soups do.",

I just keep cooling milk handy...Oh--do take some of the potatoes and mash them, as Chef John suggests. It makes the soup much creamier--the way we New Englanders like it.",

I think I loved this more than my husband but he really liked it too. I didn't like the taste of tarragon - it was my 1st experience with this herb and it has a licorice flavor which I wasn't fond of and don't feel it enhanced the chowder. I think I will use fresh thyme the next time - which I keep in the frig. I also used a cherry red pepper - about 3/4 of it and the heat was just fine. Thank you for a great recipe - I will make again soon - only with the cheaper bay scallops!",
