We cut the recipe by about a fourth and it still made about 8 cups. We froze it in 2 cup sizes, as the bottles at the store are 16 ounces. \nThese are the modifications I made to the recipe, for our 1/4 size batch. I did my own calculations, as I didn't trust the ones on the site to be accurate enough, and they did turn out with different numbers than I did.\nI actually didn't have as much fresh tomatoes as it called for (nor did I have a food mill), so I actually just used 1/2 the amount in fresh tomatoes and 1/2 the amount in crushed tomatoes, and it turned out great. I used 4 large tomatoes. With the fresh tomatoes, I peeled them by cutting an x on the non-stem end and dipping them in boiling water to make the peel easier to remove. Then I cut them into quarters and put them into my food processor (I didn't bother seeding them). I put the crushed tomatoes into the food processor as well (one large 28 oz can) of crushed tomatoes and one 6 ounce can of tomato paste. Then you boil all of this and while this is boiling down (to reduce the liquid) you can work on chopping everything else. We used 1/2 bunch of cilantro, 1 bell pepper (seeded) and one onion, 1/2 head of crushed garlic and one seeded jalapeno pepper. I had never worked with jalapeno before, and I used gloves to handle it. I was afraid of making it too spicy, so I only used 1 pepper, but after I tasted a",

Be sure to make this recipe as it is stated then it will be fabulous! I dont have a mill so I just chopped it and pureed it in this little chopper gadget that I have. Worked great! Next time I am going to use only 4 jalepenos in the recipe that I halfed because with 8 it was a bit too spicy for me! My husband loves it spicy! This is the best salsa recipe that I have found yet. Just perfect. We are having mexican tonight now! Highly recommend and thanks for sharing Joyce!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great salsa recipe. I've searched for an \"authentic\" salsa recipe to mimic my favorite restaurant's recipe and this definitely hits the mark. I've made it several times following the 2o serving recipe and have a several things I changed to fit my tastes. Depending on how many serving you want to prepare you should adjust your cook time. For 20 servings you will only have to boil 30 minutes at the most to reduce it by 1/3. I boiled the tomatoes until the skin cracked to help with peeling them. I doubled the cilantro because I love the flavor it gives the salsa. I used 4 large jalepeno peppers and 2 serrano peppers to get a nice medium heat. I did not use the bell peppers because if I wanted that kind of salsa I'd just buy a jar of Pace. I also didn't use 1/2 head of garlic. Just use maybe a third of it. I made this once and it had no heat at all. I figured out that I accidentally put the peppers in when I first started boiling the tomato mixture. If you do that it'll cook all the heat out of the peppers. It'll smell hot as fire but actually be kind of sweet tasting. If the salsa is too \"soupy\" for your taste try saving 1/4 of the tomato chunks that you prepared at the beginning to throw in with your peppers towards the end of the cooking cycle. I hope this will help others learn from my mistakes.:)",
