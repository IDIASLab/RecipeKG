If the oil is poured to quickly or the blender is not on a high speed you get an oily mess.  It is simple if you follow that simple rule.  If you use olive oil it will have a strong taste, if you use canola oil it will be more like traditional mayonnaise.  The most important thing though is this is the type of mayonnaise that you get food poisoning with if its left at room temperature because of the raw egg.  DO NOT TAKE A POTATO SALAD TO A PICNIC AND LEAVE IT OUT.  If you are going to a picnic use commercially prepared mayonnaise.",

Before I had not much success making my own mayo but the stick blender makes it in less than one minute. Place all ingredients in the bottom of a tall narrow container that your stick blender can fit easily in. Place blender all the way to the bottom turn on and slowly raise the blender. If any of the oil doesn't blend right in just move the blender up and down to incorporate! Easy delicious! thank you for sharing Cynthia!!",
