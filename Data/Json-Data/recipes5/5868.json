I scaled the recipe to 2 servings for hubs and I,  skipped the hot sauce, added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder and used the thicker cut loins. My fish was broiled on high about 8\" from the broiler since it was thick and I knew it would take longer. I broiled about 10 minutes before adding the sauce and broiled for another 2 minutes as stated. I would consider a light oil coating before the first broil next time on the loins to ensure the outer doesn't dry out. This probably wouldn't be needed on fillets since they cook faster. The butter allowed some of the topping to melt off and into the pan. Save that yummy goodness and spread over the fish when done. Or just eat it with a spoon, which ever you prefer. This recipe is a keeper. Yum!",
