With half of the mix I used pepper jack cheese, blue cheese dressing and a scant 1/4C blue cheese crumbles.  With the other I used cheddar/jack cheese, ranch dressing and 1 tsp. of powdered ranch dressing mix.  Served them side by side with some blue cheese crumbles to spoon on top as they chose.  I did use low or reduced fat ingredients where I could but that's my personal take.\nHINT:  Blue cheese can be pricey and extras spoil if you don't use it frequently.  I always buy the amount I need at the salad bar in my local grocery.  It's less expensive by the pound there and I don't end up with a lot of leftovers to worry about wasting.",

I am one who does definitely prefer bleu cheese to ranch on my buffalo style wings, but it seems that not everyone has my good taste! The bleu cheese taste was a bit strong however, but that may be because of the dressing that I use which is Bob's Big Boy\u00ae brand. It is a very rich dressing. I may temper it by halving the bleu cheese dressing and adding in some ranch next time. Not sure. Anyway, 5 stars because I loved it and I'm sure that it can be made a little less potent so as to please most everyone.",
