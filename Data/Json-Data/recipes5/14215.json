For example I didn't have any hamburger buns laying around nor was I about to buy any specifically for this recipe. But I did have some odds and ends laying around that substituted quite nicely some partially smooshed bakery garlilc croutons and about half a dozen lonely crostini hanging out in the freezer. In other words any type of bread you have around works out fine. For a more complex flavor I used poultry seasoning instead of rubbed sage; enough to my satisfaction again I didn t measure. For richness and added moistness I added a little melted butter to the stuffing and didn t use quite as much celery and onion as the recipe directed again I added it to taste to what seemed right for me. I topped the stuffed chops with bacon and because my chops were quite large (thanks Hubs ) they needed about 45 minutes in the oven. Upon serving I finished them off with a quick gravy made of melted butter cornstarch chicken broth and a dash each of Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce for color. So use this great reference recipe confidently working with it to your own tastes and you ll be very pleased.",

I placed the seasoned chops in dish put stuffing over chops poured (eyeballed) chicken broth over stuffing...covered with foil baked 40 minutes uncovered and baked another 15 adding broth if neccesary.
