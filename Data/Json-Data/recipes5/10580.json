If you can find some wild mushrooms like morel, chanterelle, porcini, or lobster, use them.

I used a lot more mushrooms than called for, run through the food processor to slice very thin and just a bit more cheese because it was the portion size I bought. Note: sottocenere is not cheap but you need very little to give a BIG taste punch. I also left a little of the peel on the potatoes as I like the added texture. Do let the casserole sit for 10 minutes or so to set up. Guests raved about it and nothing was left. One thing: I would prefer that the potatoes be given in pounds rather than number because size varies so much. But thanks for this great, easy recipe. It's a definite keeper!!",

Because of the comments about it being too milky or liquidy I made a roux with butter and flour then added the cream and dissolved the cheese in that.  It was a little thick so I diluted with some chicken broth and then poured a little over each layer as I went.    Cooked for 1 hr 15 min then added the extra cheese on the top with some Panko.   Under the broiler for about 5 min and this came out perfect.  Better than any fancy restaurants!    The sottocerene was amazing in this.  I also added a little Gruyere cheese too.   Soooo good!
