As long as you cook the meat long enough, and season thoughtfully, there's really no way this sauce isn't going to be great. So, while you may not have grown up in an Italian-American home, with this comforting sauce simmering on the stove every Sunday, your family still can. Serve the sauce over pasta and top with the tender meat.",

Simmered for 4 hours, removed meat (which was tender / falling off of the bone), simmered for another hour to let the sauce reduce a bit more, and served it with garlic bread and fresh local pasta. Really a treat. I really want to suggest not pureeing the tomatoes or using tomato sauce - using your hands to break up the San Marzano's like instructed provides some great texture. A+, 5/5!",

I brown in a dutch oven and then brown my tomato paste a bit and add my San Marzano after deglazing the pan with wine. Plenty of garlic is the key!
