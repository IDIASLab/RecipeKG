I found using chicken stock a good choice, more flavorful than just water. As for the cooking time, check your sprouts before the directed 15 minutes - I don't think they need that long.  In addition, caramelizing of the onions won't happen at med-high heat (they'd BURN at that temp for that long!), and at a lower temperature the bacon won't crisp up at all. I'd say cook both together at a medium temperature until the bacon is cooked to semi-crisp and the onions have softened - add the garlic toward the last minute or so, so that it doesn't burn. Also, give this a good dose of fresh ground pepper.",
