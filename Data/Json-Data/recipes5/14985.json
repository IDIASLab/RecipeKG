The only changes I made were cooking my potato cubes in water with chicken base (similar to boullion but in a loose powder).  I did not even add any butter and they didn't need it.  I taste-tested at the end to check for any salt addition, as I had the boullion and ranch mix with salt already in there; they only needed a sprinkle.  They were so whippy light and thank goodness my electric mixer didn't give out until the very end!UPDATE:1/22/06...Since I love the flavor of these I wanted to make again and didn't have sour cream...no problem!  I just omitted it, again did not add any butter and just used the cream cheese and broth liquid from cooking potatoes in.  I grated some fresh romano cheese on top and into the oven...mmmmm, sooo good!  Texture and everything was still superb!",

I found these to be way too thick and not nearly seasoned enough. I added twice the amount of ranch dressing mix and still the finished dish was way to bland. I also thought there was too much sour cream resulting in a too sour taste. I did add cheese on top and would do that again. I also added a lot of milk to get the proper consistency. Next time I'd either go for triple the ranch dressing or just add more salt and pepper. But really I think next time I'll just make standard homemade mashed potatoes...the ultimate comfort food.",
