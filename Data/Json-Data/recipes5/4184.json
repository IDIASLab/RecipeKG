I added pepper and granulated garlic to the flour and salt mixture.  I also doubled the sauce because I was making 4 chicken breasts.  I didn't measure the amount of lemon juice I used, I just put in the juice of one extra large lemon.  The lemon flavor was great, and the chicken was cooked perfectly in the amount of time recommended.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!",

This recipe is amazingly awesome!!!!!!!Just like Olive Gardens. My only suggestion is to double or TRIPLE the sauce because I love to dip my bread in it as well as make sure my meat is coated well. I don't like to skimp. This is also great  substituting veal and I may try the sauce on pork chops. You can NOT go wrong with this recipe. EASY EASY and friends will think you fussed a long time over it. This will become a staple in my house. Everyone has GOT to try this one. ENJOY!!",

The sauce was so good, you could easily triple it and use every drop!  I did not find the lemon overpowering or the capers too salty -- it was just perfect for our tastes.  However, next time I will pound the chicken breasts to flatten them a little as another reviewer recommended.  I also think the butter could easily be cut in half and not be missed.

For a change I made it last night with garlic-marinated green olives instead of capers and it was great. The olives have a flavor quality similar to the capers and are a great substitute for those people who don't like capers. I like to serve this with couscous. Also I double the wine and lemon juice in the sauce but not the butter; I like the extra sauce but can't bring myself to use a whole stick of butter!",
