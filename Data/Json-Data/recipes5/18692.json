I was using steel cut oats (granular in appearance / not rolled flakes) so I used the box ratio of 4c water to 1c oats.  Plugged in at midnight. Awoke 7:00 a.m. to hot, creamy oatmeal. Required a stir to get rid of foamy layer, but not much loss in \"cling-ons.\"  *Note to self, use a crock pot liner for zero loss.*  I stirred in  salt and fat free 1/2 1/2, served a bowl with lite butter and Brown Sugar Splenda.  VERY creamy, but a tad gluey. The chewy nutty texture from steel cut oats was lost; more akin to what microwave instant oatmeal is like. I ate a bowl, buttered a loaf pan and poured the rest into the loaf pan and chilled, wrapped. Next several mornings, I sliced a piece of \"loaf\" into a shallow dish w/ butter/sugar, and into the microwave it went for 1-2 minutes. Hot bubbling oatmeal followed, topped with a bit more 1/2 and 1/2, which was delicious. It stayed fresh for days and days that way.  ",

To avoid a cooked on mess, your crock-pot needs to be 2/3-3/4 full when you turn it on. The recipe as written would fail miserably in a 6 qt cooker. Also, due to the long cooking time, use 20-25% more liquid than the oat container calls for.  I wouldn't use instant oatmeal here.  Try Old-Fashioned or Steel-Cut oats.\n\nI have a 6 qt crock pot and I used:\n2 cups old-fashioned oats\n1 cup steel cut oats\n8 cups water\n3 cups milk\n4 Tbsp butter\n1/2 cup brown sugar (should have used more)\n\nI cooked on low for 8 hours and stirred.  The result was creamy and delicious and there was just a little stuck in the corners.  This made a lot, but for the rest of the week I'll just portion it out and add a little milk before re-heating.",

Use the slowcooker like a bain-marie (water bath)! Inside my slowcooker I put a crock of some type (I use a corningwear pot or a 4 cup pyrex measuring cup). I put all of the oatmeal and water/milk per the recipe into the corningwear pot and then add water to the crockpot AROUND the corningwear pot to about halfway up the side of the corning wear pot. I don't put a lid on the corningwear pot. I put the lid on the slowcooker and put it on low overnight which for me is usually about 6 or 7 hours. In the morning the oatmeal is perfect and just needs a stir. Nothing has ever been stuck to the corningwear pot and because I didn't put the oatmeal into the slow cooker itself I don't have to clean the slowcooker. I just empty the water and wipe it dry.",
