Just use a half cup of the water called for to do it. I stay away from white flour in most bread recipes if I can so if using whole wheat you will only need about 4 cups. I used the rye flour called for great texture. No egg yolks so I used 3 large egg whites beatened with a fork. I love oranges so I grated two whole navel oranges and rinsed grater into pan with the water in recipe to get it all. Use everything else called for. I enjoy mixing my bread by hand.
