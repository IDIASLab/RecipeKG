These are easy and wonderful, and the best thing is they stand up beautifully to adjustments if you don't happen to have everything or want to add something.  I live outside of the city in the mountains, so (especially with fuel costs skyrocketing) I can't just run to a store to pick up extra ingredients.  The first time I made these I made them exactly as written ... DELICIOUS! Everyone raved!  We invited some friends over for a cookout, and among them were people who had been here the first time I made these, and they asked if I would make them again.  This time, however, I used what I had in the cupboard for beans: black beans, pinto beans, red bean and Garbanzo beans.  I added some chopped garlic and used chopped saute's Brats instead of the burger, and threw in a chopped jalapeno for good measure.  MORE raves!!  I made a huge crockpot full, and even had people ask if they could take some home ... but no leftovers to speak of.  So feel confident with this recipe and make minor changes if need be - this is a keeper!!",
