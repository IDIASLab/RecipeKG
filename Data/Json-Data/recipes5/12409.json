I took the roast out of the refrigerator for about an hour to warm up.  I used olive oil instead of butter to cook the spices and I ended up using more course ground pepper - what can I say, we love pepper.    I cooked the roast at 300 until it reached 125 degrees and then turned the oven up to 425 and cooked to 145.  Took out and rested while I did the gravy.  I did do the gravy a bit different.  I used 2 T butter and 2 T flour - made a roux in a seperate pan.  I removed the cooked vegetables and strained the juices from the baking pan - I used the drippings plus 1 cup pork stock to make the gravy.  Very good!",
