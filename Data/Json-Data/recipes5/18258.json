For the sauce I used light margarine and cut the brown sugar to 2 tablespoons. Also cooked it in a saucepan instead of the microwave which eliminated the grainy texture some others encountered. I definitely recommend cutting the sprouts in half before coating with the sauce. It allows the flavor to soak in.",

I used fresh brussel sprouts roughly two handfuls and then pretty much followed the rest of the recipe but eyeballed the rest of the ingredients. I don't have a microwave so I simply let the sprouts remain the strainer and put the butter (margarine actually) nuts and spices in the same pot I cooked the sprouts and let it all melt and warm up. I put the sprouts in a glass dish and poured the sauce over top. This is worth trying and I'll make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!",
