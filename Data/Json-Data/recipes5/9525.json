Great for busy nights with little time to cook.  Might try diced tomatoes with jalepenos next time.  Overall very good.",

My changes: skipped the onion, sauteed a little bit of frozen diced green pepper. It seemed like a lot of sausage for just 1 can of kidney beans, so I used 2 cans of light red kidney beans. I used 1 can of petite diced tomatoes, drained the can into the pan and only used half of the tomatoes (my preference). I added the following seasonings while everything was simmering: garlic powder, creole seasoning, cayenne pepper and oregano. I can't wait to have leftovers for dinner this evening! Yum!",
