You just need to make it a day or two in advance. Definitely make the homemade croutons! They are delicious, and so much better than the pre-made kind (I used fresh sour dough bread from Publix). The only thing I would do differently would be to decrease the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp. My husband and son didn't think it was too hot, but it was burning my mouth! I will definitely make this yummy soup again. Thanks Chef John!!",

In fact my guest were eating them as fast as I could make them and I was afraid I might not have enough for the soup! They did add to the flavor of the soup. If I were to make this again I think I would add the sausage as some suggested or bacon to up the flavor. Thanks Chef John for this recipe. You are right it would make a good base for other meals.",
