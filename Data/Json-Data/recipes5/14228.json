I took some to work and my co-workers raved about it also. I tweaked it a little. I used pork loin instead of shoulder and I used two 24 oz. jars of La Victoria green chunky salsa (medium). Very delicious. Even better the next day.",

I did make a few changes but only one to the ingredients - I used a jalapeno pepper in place of the serrano because serranos are too hot for our family. I mixed all the ingredients together rather than layering them in the crock pot because I wanted all the flavors to mingle around the meat. I also used 3 lbs of pork chops because I couldn't find a 3 lb roast. The chops worked great and the flavor was wonderful. To serve the meat I made baked chimichangas. I shredded the meat and mixed it with the solids from the salsa and onions and about 1/2 cup liquid. I then placed about 1/4 c Monterey Jack cheese on a tortilla and then covered it with about 3/4 c meat and rolled them up. I placed them seam side down in a 9x13 baking pan brushed the top with some butter and baked them in a 425 oven until the tops were tanned. This meat was perfect for chimichangas and I will definately make this recipe many times! Thank you for sharing!",

My only change will next time will be spicing up a bit more as the serrano chiles weren't that spicy. I will probably follow others suggestions and add a jalapeno along w/ the other peppers",
