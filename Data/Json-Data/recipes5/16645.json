I think the name is old fashioned; before browned butter became \"cool\" they just chose a name that reflected the flavor rather than the texture (again there is no caramel texture here). I would definitely call these \"Browned Butter sandwich cookies\" now... cooler and more accurate! All that said these are delicious. I make the cookies much larger (more like a walnut than a marble) and flatten them to more like 1/4 inch. Then I double the frosting! They come out chewy that way. Rich but awesome!",

I chilled the dough for about 20 minutes then made the cookies... I got a total of 116 cookies (58 sandwiches) out of the batch. Instead of using my palm and a fork I dipped the bottom of a smallish glass in sugar and pressed the cookies down so they all ended up close to the same size. Instead of the caramel cream I used a peanut butter cream filling ( cup PB 1 cups or so of icing sugar a teaspoon of vanilla and 4 or 5 TBS of milk). Very fabulous and next time I'll try the caramel cream! Thanks for sharing Robin!",
