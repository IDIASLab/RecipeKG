I went to the store to buy tahini (i have never bought or used before) and the stuff is expensive and only comes in fairly large amounts...so i decided to make my own since all it is is sesame seed paste.  To make, slow cook sesame seeds for 15min @ 300. make sure the don't brown.  I did 1/4 cup seeds. the ratio is 1 part oil to 4 parts seeds.  Place seeds in food processor with 1/2 the oil and pulse until mixed then add the rest of oil and chop/pulse until it forms a paste. When I first mixed all my ingredients together I though the tahini overpowered the recipe but once it chilled for about an hour it was PERFECT!!!  I will make this all the time!!",
