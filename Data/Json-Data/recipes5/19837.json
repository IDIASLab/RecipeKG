You can easily add spices and other ingredients to make it your own, although, we have to say - it's quite good the way it is. This can  easily be prepared the day before or put into the freezer for later use. Serve over baked potato or corn chips with 'fixins' such as sour cream, grated cheese, onions, etc.  For a richer flavor, you are able to make this dish the night before and keep in refrigerator until the next day. Enjoy!",

I used extra lean ground beef instead of the turkey because that's what I had in the house and a bottle of ale because I didn't have beer. I've never added sugar or cinnamon to meat before. It really was delicious. This is a keeper. I put it over white basmati rice.",

I had never added beer to a chili recipe before either, but I honestly liked the flavor it added. I did add a little less chipotles though, because 6 are way too much for any dish. I added 2 chipotle peppers, and 2 teaspoons of sauce. Also I upped my chili powder to a 1/4 cup. I also did not have whole cloves, but I did have them in powdered form, so I added a few dashes. I also added some smoked paprika, which was delicious. I will make this chili again, but I will tweak it a bit.  \n\n**EDIT**\n\nAfter serving it to my family, it was a HUGE hit with them. I changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars. My hubby begged me to save the recipe.",
