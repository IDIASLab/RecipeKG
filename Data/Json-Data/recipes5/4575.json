He's not big on trying new things but when I told him about how healthy quinoa is and had a way to make it that he'd like he went for it. I read over the reviews to see what adjustments we could make and with them it was delicious! We omitted the salt used half the lemon juice and added chickpeas. I cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth and used red instead of green pepper (that's all I had). I also am weird about raw onions so when the chicken was almost done I threw in the onions so they could cook a little. We will definitely make this over and over again! Thanks a ton!!! (:",
