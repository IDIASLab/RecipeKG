I followed the recipe exact only using one full batch of Scotdog's dry ranch dressing mix minus the dry buttermilk powder which I ended up stirring in after all once I tasted it. I think this dip is GREAT. The cilantro with the tomatillos and the ranch and the peppers all work together with the sour cream base into this dip of wonderfulness. New favorite dip. It's really great. I think this would be a great topping for a low-calorie nacho plate or part of a sour cream filling for burritos/enchiladas. I might just use it. Way to rock it BBQgirl. NOTE: I did not have whole pickled jalapeno peppers so I used pickled jalapeno rings....gosh....a good handful.",
