Fage (pronounced \u201cfa-yeh\u201d) nonfat yogurt is very thick and creamy and will NOT interfere with other flavors.  1 tablespoon of mayo is 90 calories, 10 grams of fat, 5 mg cholesterol, multiply them by the 1 cup (which has 16 tablespoons in it) called for in the recipe and you now have 1,440 calories, 160 grams of fat, and 80 mg cholesterol!!  1 cup of fage nonfat yogurt is a Total of 120 calories, No fat, No cholesterol, and plus you get 20 grams of protein.  I used the yogurt and kept the rest of recipe the same and it was delicious!!  If you want to use chives in place of green onion you can, and for those of you who don\u2019t want to deal with the messy anchovy fillets, you can use Giovanni\u2019s anchovy paste.  1 hour of chill time was sufficient.  Thank you Lisa! Your recipe is full of flavor!!",

It is a very thick dressing so you don't need a lot to cover the salad. I made it about 1 hour before I served the salad.
