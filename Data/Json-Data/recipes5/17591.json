I do have a tried & true recipe but I was too lazy to dig it out.  I have made it enough times to remember that  this crust was the ingredients I liked. Some pointers from a Canadian:  I always find the filling too sweet in these recipes.  What I am used to is just the dates and the water(reduce to half a cup) and LEMON JUICE (extract is the best).  This makes the date flavour smooth.  Cook on the stove & mash with a fork until it becomes a paste. I like to use an 11 x 7 pan, spraying it with PAM.  Use 3/5 of the crumb mix for the base and press it down tightly.  I don't put it up the sides because the PAM prevents sticking and I get nicer squares.The date filling I take small scoops with the fork and start in corners to flatten it, then the middle, and use the remaining to fill it it.  This prevents the bottom from coming up when you are trying to spread it.  For the top I usually use my hand to crumble it evenly over the top, then press down firmly.  When I take it out of the oven I quickly cut it (4 squares across & 6 down the top) and let it cool in the pan.  Then when you are ready to serve them you recut.  Freeze beautifully(however, I never seem to have enough left to freeze).  Just some tips!",

The only thing I changed was eliminating the sugar in the date mixture, as I felt it was sweet enough, and I substituted coconut oil for butter (if you're not familiar with its health benefits, google it, or Dr Mary Enig).  The coconut oil stays solid at room temp so it is no different to cut in than butter.  I also added about 1/2 cup walnuts to the date mixture.  I used an 8x12 pan, which seemed to be the perfect size to keep the proportion of date and oat right.  Yummy and healthy!",
