I typically don't care for eggs and tomatoes but the canned tomatoes changed my mind. They burst with tomato flavor but don't have that crunch like fresh toms so the texture mixes perfectly with the eggs. I cheated and used some leftover peperonata (bell peppers potatoes and olives) instead of the roasted peppers. I topped it with some habanero sauce but as is the flavor is right on. Thank you.",
