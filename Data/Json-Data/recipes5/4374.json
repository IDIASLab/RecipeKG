I used different veggies based on what I had at home (fresh onion carrot celery red pepper potato canned lima beans and tomato and frozen peas). The only thing I would do differently would be to not roast the beets. I don't think it's necessary because the beets will soften if you simmer the soup long enough and they were much sloppier to peel after roasting than if I had done it while they were raw.",

Also i didn't have crab so I used the perch we had in the freezer from our fishing trip. I cooked the filet pieces right in the soup. The perch cooked well and did not fall apart. This soup had great textures and was delightfully sweet and hearty. Great comfort food for a cold winter day.",
