I wasn't certain if the Smithfield breakfast sausage would contribute enough spices and salt so I used garlic salt and black pepper to season the eggs. That's the only additions I added. We also suggest using flat bread the type one would use for wraps the thinner ones. The pita was too much bread for us making it difficult to cut through without losing the toppings. All in all very good Smithfield!",

Make ahead a few and keep warm in the oven on low until ready to serve. The recipe is very versatile where you can top the breakfast pizza with any ingredients you prefer. Drizzle some sriracha on top for a spicy egg pizza & serve for dinner. I will be making this again.",
