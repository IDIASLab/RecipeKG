At breakfast this morning we dubbed them \"Pear Puddles\" :) because the do spread out a good bit and that's what they look like.  I used 4 pears (didn't bother to measure, just needed to get rid of them) and because of the reviews I added a little more flavoring. I used cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and some finely grated orange peel just because I had it. They were very tasty! We ate them with a little butter, and they were sweet enough (but not too sweet) that they didn't need anything else. Will make again :) Thank you",
