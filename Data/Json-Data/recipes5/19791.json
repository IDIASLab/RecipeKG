I also used drained canned plums instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand. Instead of the brown sugar I poured about 2T of the heavy syrup from the can over the pie. It probably came out a little too moist but it was still scrumptious! I want to make this recipe as written sometime soon.",

I cut that amount back significantly and mixed it with 3 plums (not 4) and I still had a dish full of chicken...would do that again. Thought I had mace on hand but I didn t so I did add some cardamom which is a good flavor affiliate for plums. This cooked up beautifully has not only a wonderful balance of sweet and savory but lovely presentation as well. I wouldn t hesitate to serve this to company. Very very nice recipe.",

Next time I will try adding some veggies especially some cubed pre-roasted butternut squash which we usually have on hand(I think this will blend well with the sweetness of the plums). But overall this is a great idea. The sweetness from the plums and the savory of the seasonings and chicken really go well together. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",

It was different but good. I am pretty sure the puff pastry will make it even better. EDITED 7/2014 -- I've made this several times now following the recipe exactly. I think it's a 5 star recipe and I tend to be stingy with 5 star ratings. The only thing I do that is beyond the directions is cook the chicken in chicken broth before shredding so its more flavorful.",
