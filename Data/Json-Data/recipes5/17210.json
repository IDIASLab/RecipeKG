I added sliced onions and mushrooms, which I sauted before browning the chicken and returned to the pot after adding the liquid.  I also cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup, as per others suggestions.\r\nIn addition, I only used 1/2 cup of a nice \"Concho y Toro\" chilean merlot and added 1/2 cup of reduced sodium chicken broth for the liquid.\r\nI dredged the chicken in seasoned salt and the paprika and let it sit 15 minutes which helped to create a nice color during the browning process, as I decided not to fully cook the chicken before the simmer to reduce dryness.\r\nI also thickened the broth, as per a suggestion, after removing the cooked chicken by adding 1 tablespoon cornstarch and heating to boiling.\r\nThis recipe was excellent!  My two year old gobbled up the chicken and demanded not only seconds but thirds!  The sauce, thick with onions and mushrooms, made a wonderful gravy for mashed potatoes.  \r\nI was paid the highest compliment for this dish as my mother-in-law asked for the recipe!  What better endorsement than that?  Enjoy!",

Next time I may use 3/4 c. wine and 1/4 cup water or broth. It was pretty powerful but good chicken. I also coated the chicken with salt pepper and paprika before I started cooking.

First off, I seasoned chicken with salt pepper, and seared in olive oil until juices ran clear.  Then I removed from pan, drained some of the oil, added 1/2 cup of sliced red onion, i garlic clove chopped, 1 cup of red wine, 1/2 cup of chicken stock, and 1 good tbs of brown sugar.  DO NOT USE ALL THE BROWN SUGAR RECIPE CALLS FOR, I also added some garlic powder and onion powder, and 1/2 tsp of dried basil, and a good pinch of crushed red pepper to balance the sweetness.  I let sauce simmer for awhile and added the chicken back to the pan, coating well with sauce.  Let reduce down a little.  Meanwhile I cooked 1/2lb of spaghetti noodles.  I removed the chicken from the pan, and placed on platter, and tossed spaghetti in remainder of sauce. The sauce this way is wonderful!!!NOt sweet at all, and a little spice from the crushed peppers. It will be a winner if you tweak with it, and the spaghetti with the sauce was out of this world, it was a gourmet meal!",
