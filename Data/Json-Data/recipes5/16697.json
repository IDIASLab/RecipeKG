This gave the cookie a more of a pie flavour! Ugh! A whole CUP of butter? I did without the butter and used 1/4C applesauce & 1/4C of oil. I also reduced the white chips to 1C. I think 2C. would be too much and take away from the cookie itself. I wanted these cookies to be plump so I added 2 Tsp of baking powder. Also for my first batch I followed the directions and baked at 300 but I decided to finish the rest at a 350 oven and baked for 15min. In direction #2 it says to put in Pumpkin PIE puree but in the ingredients it say pumpkin puree. There is a difference in the two products. I used plain pumpkin puree. Overall I think the cookies are good. They have a cake/muffin texture very soft and moist. THX",
