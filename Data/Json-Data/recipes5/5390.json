And while this is quick and easy saving on time and effort in the kitchen due to the pre-made sauce it just doesn't meet expectations in the flavor department. I followed the recipe exactly but found that seasoning the flour is a must so I added a little garlic powder along with the salt and pepper. I also used olive oil vs. veg. oil to pan fry the chicken. The sauce leaves something to be desired and is thin and watery vs. thick and creamy. I ended up adding a little cornstarch to thicken it but in the end it was bland in spite of the additional parsley and lemon zest. Even with some tweaking I don't think I would make this again....",

The canned sauce is pretty bland and sort of reminded me of extremely watered down cream of chicken soup. Honestly I expected quite a bit more flavor from a Progresso product. I had to add salt and pepper to the sauce to get any real flavor from it. I didn't measure the lemon juice but I estimate that I used about 2 Tbs which was plenty. Any more would have been far too tart. I also did not simmer the chicken in the sauce as that would have destroyed the beautiful golden crispness obtained by sauteing the chicken. I served this with brown jasmine rice cooked in home made chicken stock and bacon/onion flavored green beans.",

I have a Tones spice roasted garlic combination so melted butter added the roasted garlic lemon then braised the chicken breast. Removed the braised breast added flour making a rue. I baked the chicken. Then added to the rue chicken bouillon cream and milk making a tasty gravy. Did not have rice I usedpasta shells. Turned out fine to me (my husband liked the chicken but not the pasta in the sauce). It was not as simple as this recipe BUT this recipe gave concepts for what I did with my lemon with chicken search. What I had on hand I made my own creamy roasted garlic with chicken stock cooking sauce thanks for the idea Progresso. I ll see if I can find the product and try it.
