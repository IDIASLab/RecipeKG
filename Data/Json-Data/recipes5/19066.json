I used Pam instead of olive oil and shook salt and black pepper over the tray before popping them in the oven (10 minutes per side). The mixture of seasonings and liquids cooked down nicely into a sweet, yet spicy sauce. I would recommend that if you aren't a fan of spicy foods or are using a mustard that is spicier then Dijon (like I stupidly did) then you should cut the amount of mustard and horseradish in half. Other then that, it was great!",

I cut the red wine vinegar to 1 Tbsp. and cooked the onion and garlic in a small saute pan then added the rest of the sauce and let it sit on the burner that was still warm but off. We had it with pork chops and I put about 1/2 tsp. dijon mustard on the chops with about a tsp of sauce then baked them. I then poured the sauce over the cooked chops. We had it with horseradish mashed potatoes(potatoes sour cream horseradish kosher salt fresh ground pepper). The sauce was delicious mixed with the potatoes also.",
