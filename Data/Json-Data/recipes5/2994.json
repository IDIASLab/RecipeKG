I added two tablespoons of black bean sauce some dark sesame oil and a pinch of sugar (or Splenda). I also toasted the almonds as well as the sesame seeds. After those additions to the dressing this recipe was fabulous and my husband and two boys (ages 1 and 3) loved it as well. I made all 8 servings and we polished off the whole bowl. This will easily become a regular recipe in our house!!",

The sauce was bland so I added 3/4 of the chicken seasoning that came with the ramen and about a teaspoon of vinegar.  I made everyones in an individual bowls so that the leftovers would not get soggy. Only for a pot luck would I mix everything together before serving.  Cabbage can be used in place of the bok choy.
