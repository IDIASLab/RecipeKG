The citrus syrup seemed to bring all the flavors together, contributed a just right sweetness and prevented the fruit from turning color.  Versatile too, since this would work with whatever fruits you choose or have on hand.  I made this for just Hubs and me, so I just tossed the fruit and syrup altogether and served the salad in individual dessert dishes.",

One change - I did not layer it but mixed it all together and it was so beautiful, mixed together.  The syrup was great too.  There were about 70 people at the Picnic and people kept coming back for more.  I made it bigger than called for and it still went faster than anything else.  A definite keeper!!!  Wish I could give it more stars.  I acutally cut up everything the night before except the banana, and even made the sauce the night before too.  Then a few hous before I served it I tossed it together, then cut and added the banana.  YUMMY",
