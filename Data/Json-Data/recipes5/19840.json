I used a variety of mustard; dijon spicy brown and yellow for a total of just under the 1/4 cup called for. I added a little extra ketchup along with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper about a Tablespoon of Worchestershire sauce about a Tablesppon of Crytstal hot sauce in addition to the Jalapeno pepper sauce a large clove of fresh chopped garlic and about a quarter of a finely chopped yellow onion. The result was a delicious blend of a little sweetness with just enough spice to make it interesting! I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey white and dark meat and cooked on low in the slow cooker for about 3 hours before serving. A big hit with the guys helping to remodel my basement the weekend after Thanksgiving. Even my husband who is not a big fan of turkey loved it! Will definitely hold on to this one for future turkey leftovers!",

I have the turkey and sauce in the slow cooker now and the time can't pass fast enough for mom and I to have dinner. I used three turkey legs since that is how many came in the pack. I doubled the sauce to make sure there would be enough for the additional turkey leg. Thank you for sharing this recipe. JP 8/19/15 My my this was absolutely delicious. Rave reviews from family and coworkers. I took some for lunch to share -- they truly loved this BBQ Turkey. So much so they are requesting it again. They suggest I make it every couple of months. We have a holiday party every year in December if it is an afternoon party I am to make this dish. I will definitely use this BBQ sauce on ribs and chicken. Yummy! JP",
