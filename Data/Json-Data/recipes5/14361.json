                "reviewBody": "I had not seen a recipe for Buffalo Chicken Meatballs before so decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe exactly. This was my first time working with ground chicken was quite sticky. My meatballs were a little flat on the bottom but no big deal. The recipe tells you to line the pan with foil. Do NOT skip this part. I had a good quality non stick pan and there was black goo all over it. I think this is from the French fried onions caramelizing. Next time I would be sure to line the pan. Ok now for the meatballs themselves. They were very moist and did not fall apart. I am not sure about the cilantro. I like it but not sure that it worked well in this recipe. I would either cut the amount in half or leave it out all together. I believe minced celery or celery salt instead of garlic salt would be a nice addition. Also was not a huge fan of the hot sauce mixed with the ranch dressing. I believe I would try mixing some hot sauce in with the meatballs and then dipping in blue cheese along with celery and carrot sticks. I would try this again with the mentioned changes. I do think this is a good base recipe that you can adjust to your own tastes. Thanks for the idea!",

I added a dash of ginger powder since these balls will be in a oriental dish. I plan to use pad thai rice noodles with an asian sauce. They are perfect for it!

I used a half pack of Lipton onion mix instead of the fresh veggies bc I'm not the best dicer and I have to say it actually comes out more flavorful and the meatballs more uniform that way in my opinion. I subbed panko bread crumbs for the oats. I went very heavy on the seasoning bc I've found that otherwise meatballs tend to be bland. old bay was perfect with this recipe. I added only about half the hot sauce since we don't like it too hot and a quarter cup of sweet Chile sauce with the ranch. I heated the sauce up over the stove quickly and served it on top of the meatballs. The sauce came out a little thousand islandy but it was good. I left the meatballs in the oven a little longer about 20 mins and they were perfect! my boyfriend thought they were store bought!",
