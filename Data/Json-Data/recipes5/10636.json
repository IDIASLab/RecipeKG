Hubby loved it, told me don't lose this recipe. I would never have thought to fry pastrami.It turned into delicious,crispy little bits that tasted amazing with the tangy dressing. Shaving the asparagus was a bit difficult. I don't have a V-shaped peeler and kept hitting my knuckles on the counter and I couldn't get the last strips thin enough. I finally held the asparagus close to the edge of the counter and solved the problem. It was definitely worth the effort. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John.",

Instead of the pastrami I used the bacon chips (a teaspoon or two just to flavor the dressing is all I needed)you buy in the salad toppings area. I am not a fan of oil so I dropped it to 1 Tbsp. Next time I may cut the oil out altogether (don't hold me to this when I make a vinegar and oil dressing I use 1 oil to 3 vinegars.) I couldn't wait to taste but when you do wait that couple of minutes the wilted asparaus allows you to enjoy more. Thank you John for this fabulous way to eat raw asparagus. Nutrition wise this packs a heck of a wallop!",

The contrast of the crispy fried meat with the fresh raw vegetable is a real taste treat. I added some shaved Parm & onion powder and served with a nice slice of melon. What an easy way to impress guests. Next time I think I will add maybe 1.5 - 2 tablespoons of finely chopped onion to the meat the last minute of cooking (just to wilt) but that is a personal preference. Can't wait to make it again (I honestly ate the entire 4 servings myself as a lunch) but be sure to use fresh asparagus. Both Costco & Sam's Club package their fresh asparagus really well & it is always so much better than the supermarkets that just put it out unwrapped with a rubber band around it.",
