I mixed the first ingredients listed & put them in a glass loaf pan. Then put in a 400 degree oven for 12 minutes. Then added the remaining ingredients & finished it off in the oven for another 15 minutes. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts on the grill with seasonings of my choice. Instead of heavy cream I used sour cream. I used Rotel instead of salsa since I'm not too fond of salsa in something like this. I think this is good but would prefer more texture in it like onions or bell peppers. Will I make it again; probably not. I gave it 4 stars because I changed the recipe I think to my taste for the better but would not rate the recipe down since I had changed it. Still would not have changed the texture though which to me was mushy. It does taste better after it cools down.",
