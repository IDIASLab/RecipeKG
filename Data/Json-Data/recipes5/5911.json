As it is so salty I am going to use it in a wrap or sandwich with fresh grilled chicken or other toppings that don't have salt and see how that works. Only change I made was using 1 tsp. of dried basil for the 1 Tblsp. of fresh. That worked fine. However after a day in the fridge even the basil was very dominant. I definitely consider this more of sandwich or wrap spread than a dip though imho with it being a thick consistency. Still prefer just a little mashed avocado on a sandwich or a simple guacamole.",
