Some changes I made, I didn't have quite a pound of collard greens (only 11 oz), and I used a whole onion and a lot of pre-minced garlic. I followed the rest of the spicy exactly. I felt that it was a little too gingery for my liking and if I make it again, I will half the ginger. It overpowered all the other flavors. I would probably also toss out half of the reserved water next time; I cooked for the said amount of time but it was still quite watery and I am rather impatient. It was still quite good though! I also only divided this whole dish between two people and served with a tilapia fillet. I was surprised to see that all of the ingredients were key players in detoxification so that's a plus!",

First off, when chopping the collards, remove the hard stem.  What I did was sort of cut an elongated V shape up the center of the leaf to remove the most of the hard stem and rib together.  Also, I dumped all of the collards and the water into a large bowl, and used the same vessel the collards had been in to cook the onion.  When ready I poured the collards, water and all, back into the onion mixture.  This saved some time and energy.",

I did put a pinch of salt in the water to boil the collards and I doubled the tumeric and allspice. This dish is perfectly balanced.  In my experience with Ethiopian cooking (limited), I have found the flavors are even better the next day. I've made this dish a few hours ahead of dinner time so it can develop a little .",
