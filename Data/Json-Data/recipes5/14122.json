That however is not why I docked the star. I didn't drain my Rotel tomatoes (because the recipe didn't say anything about draining) and the end result is more of a dip than a cheese spread. You should put \"drained\" after the tomatoes in the ingredient list. I made the recipe as is mixing in a food processor. We will enjoy this dip that is not pimento cheese. I will probably make it again and will be sure to drain the tomatoes.",
