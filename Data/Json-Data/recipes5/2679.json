However I omitted the fish sauce because I didn t have any. I also substituted small egg noodles for the rice because I was craving chicken noodle soup but with a red curry flavour. Lastly I used 4 cups of broth because I like there to be plenty of the liquid part of the soup and next time I will probably add 5 cups broth. It was excellent with noodles nice red curry flavour and I will make it again soon.",
