        "description": "Thirty-five years ago, a group of friends went to a little Italian restaurant south of New Orleans. We all fell in love with their oyster dressing. We ate it so often the guys made a bet to see who could duplicate the recipe. After many tries, one of our friends figured it out and won the bet. During this time I was pregnant with my son and I craved oysters any way but raw. My husband made this for me at least twice a week (35-year-old son came into this world loving oysters). Last year I found the original restaurant recipe in a New Orleans cookbook; our friend hit the nail on the head. This is his version.",

Not sure why mine turned out as it did and everyone else that has reviewed it said theirs was perfect. I will probably try again but cut the butter down and use less liquid and maybe less spices or plain breadcrumbs as the spice flavor was a little strong for me.",
