I love the fact that oatmeal makes a nutritious breakfast and I was looking for a new way to prepare it rather than eating pre-favored packaged instant oatmeal which is not that healthy. Finally I found one. However I made mine low-fat. I opt out the chocolate chips and used 1 tsp brown sugar for one serving (I scaled down to one serving) only. It is sweet enough for me as banana has its natural sweetness added to it already. And I used half water half fat-free milk. It turned out fabulous! All you health conscious people out there if you want a low-fat low-cal delicious oatmeal porridge without compromising the good taste do it this way!!! I promise you you won't be disappointed. Thank you so much for the recipe idea.",
