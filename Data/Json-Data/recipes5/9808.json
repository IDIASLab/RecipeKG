I love the stuff but you can just do so much drizzling.  This caught my eye.  Like popcorn with bacon grease, this is unusual, very tasty and decadent; and in this case, rather gourmet.  But also like popcorn with bacon grease (or cinnamon sugar) it was a nice diversion but not a worthy replacement for the traditional hot buttered popcorn. I just sprinkled and tossed as it suited me, not measuring precisely, and skipping the dried parsley.  I also used a fine popcorn salt, very sparingly, as the Parmesan is already fairly salty.",

Once done I sprinkled & mixed the truffle oil & Parmesan cheese on top. I found that the popcorn absorbed the oil too much and didn't spread as I'd liked. On the second go-around I melted some butter then added the truffle oil and drizzled on top of the popcorn salting lightly (Diamond Crystal Kosher salt) without the Parmesan cheese (didn't have any left). This worked wonders!",
