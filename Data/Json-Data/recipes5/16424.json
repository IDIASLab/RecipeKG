(We have neighbors who eat the extras that we fix.) With the spice cake, I used 1 & 1/2 cans apple pie filling. With the yellow, I used 1 & 1/2 cans PLUS added apple pie spice to the mix. They both turned out great, either is a great option, however, we really like the spice cake over the yellow. Next time we make this we'll use spice cake mix PLUS 2 cans apple pie filling. Even with 1 & 1/2 cans it didn't quite seem like enough. The cake is great though and I recommend it. Edited to add: For those that really like a more intense flavor, the spice cake may be for you. The yeloow is wonderful as well. I might consider using less brown sugar next time.",

So I decided I would try the two cans of apples instead. But really I only used 1 3/4. The recipe is soo much better! What I think happened is everyone is just using the 2 cans and thats how they know it. But I know it both ways now, and the original way is fluffier, and not so gooey like the 2 cans is. I think everyone should definitely just use the 1 can of apples. It suffices. Also, I cut up the apples this time (never have before) and I did like that better.",

Per other reviews, I used 1 & 1/2 cans of pie filling, added cinnamon & nutmeg to both the batter and the topping, only used 1/4 cup brown sugar for the topping,left out the nuts, and baked for 37 minutes.  Tastes even better after a few days in the fridge! I like to heat it in the microwave, but hubby likes it straight out of the fridge.  Thanks Mary Ann!*******UPDATE*****  Made this in muffin tins & they turned out really well!  More like personal little apple cakes, but you can still pick them up & eat them like moist muffins!  Baking time was about 30 min for the muffins.",

I use the \"premium\" apple pie filling and add a pinch of pie spices. For those who don't care for nuts, use uncooked oatmeal instead. Turns out really well in a Bundt pan, too, made more like a coffee cake; double the amount of streusel topping in that case. My golden retriever puppy loves it, too.
