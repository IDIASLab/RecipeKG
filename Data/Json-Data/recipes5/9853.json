I cut the cheese way back to less than a cup.  The end result was delicious.",

Not sure if the pasta and sausage were supposed to be hot or cold so I did the pasta and sausage first so they could cool for a while then added everything else. I added a small amount of olive oil to the pasta and mixed it then added the sausage veggies and cheese. As a result it worked as a cold pasta salad and that's how I served it along with some Irish Wheaten bread. Although I'd like a little more flavor so garlic salt and pepper would be welcome in this it was surprisingly flavorful for not having those ingredients. I added in some chopped cucumber just because I had some on hand. It added some additional color to the salad. thanks for the recipe!",
