After I got out on my own, I was determined to make barbecue beef just like hers, so I tried lots of recipes and finally came up with one of my own. I was so pleased! I called her to tell her and she laughed. She had always just used a bottle of barbecue sauce! We still laugh about that and now I've had to give her my recipe!",

From the fat drippings I caramelized one large onion then added chicken broth and the remaining marinade and boiled that down to a gravy.

I used a chuck roast hickory liquid smoke and substituted dried minced onion and some onion powder for the real stuff.

I loved that this used a homemade sauce and not some bottled stuff thanks Adrienne we really liked this barbecue! This is a keeper.",

The large amount of vinegar gives it a lot of tang so you could adjust it there if desired. My girls are native Texan BBQ fiends and they loved it.",

It was even better the next day after the meat soaked in the wonderful sauce all night. I plan to do this again and again. Next time I might caramelize the onions first if I have time. Also I did not have the 10 hours needed so I cooked it on high for 4 hours and then low for 2. The meat wasn't as tender as it probably would have been had I had the whole 10 hours to just cook it on low. Next time I'll plan ahead. One great thing about your recipe is I had all the ingredients on hand - no special trip to the store needed. Even my picky husband who isn't a huge brisket fan went back for seconds! My mom wanted me to tell you that she loved it too:). Kudos!!!!",

This is the most delicious BBQ meat I've ever tasted - definitely a keeper!! It should be noted that despite adding corn starch at the end as directed in the recipe the liquid sauce is still very then - like broth. Next time I'm going to shred the beef add it back to the corn-starch-thickened sauce mix well drain in a strainer and then serve.",
