Never had such good salsa verde and who would have thought it would come from my own kitchen, using tomatillos, peppers and oregano fresh from my own garden? I added a little more of the peppers (I used jalapeno) and a little less water, then simmered until it was not only tender, but the consistency I wanted. It was just a tad hot for me, as I included the seeds and membranes of the peppers, but after the first few bites my tongue and throat got used to it! I'm sure others would find it to have just the right heat.  Excellent! (And all gone...)",
