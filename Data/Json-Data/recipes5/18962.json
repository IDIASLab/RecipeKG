My partner got sliced sourdough by mistake but we still managed to make it work by gently squeezing it into a pan to hold the slices together. Otherwise I made the recipe as posted and the four of us ate the whole thing in about 5 minutes!! Edit 04 Jun 07 - Last two times I made this to serve a couple more people I used two brie side by side with a little gap in between them still in the one loaf of bread. I doubled all the other ingredients too so there was more pear topping to add to the extra cheesey goodness!",

The only change I made was to use Hawaiian sweet bread because I couldn't find a loaf of round sourdough at the store.

I have to say that eating the bread that the cheese is baked in is far better than any crackers. THe sourdough bread toasted and was crunchy and good. Maybe I should have used a larger round so I would have had more toasted bread to enjoy it with! Oh and baking 45 minutes is way tooo long. I did 20 and that was plenty. Otherwise it is very runny Had to let it set a bit before we ate it. I will still search for more exciting appetizers in the future.",
