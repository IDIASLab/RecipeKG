I followed the directions and put the condensed milk in a sauce pan and filled it with water half way up the can and boiled it for 3 hrs...well I ended up with half a can of dark carmel (over cooked) and half a can condensed milk. I tried putting it all in a saucepan and mixing it all together and that worked somewhat. It was burned in some places but I still served it! Everyone said it tasted fine but it could have been better my suggestion...boil can in water with can completely submerged and only boil for 2-2and 1/2 hrs. That might work better.",

Their recipe requires the condensed milk to be boiled fully submerged for 5 hours.   Originally it was served on a pastry crust.  However I use digestive biscuits crushed and mixed with butter for the base, which I assume is similar to the graham base in US, but I don't cook this - simply cool in fridge before topping with the dulce and bananas.  3/4 pint cream is whipped with 1tsp sugar and 1/2tsp  instant coffee. p.s. in UK pre-made dulce de leche is now available by the maker of a popular brand of condensed milk.
