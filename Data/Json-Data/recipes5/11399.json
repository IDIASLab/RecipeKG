The veggies need to be cut extremely thin for them to cook as quickly as the fish does. I followed the directions exactly worried that maybe there was some reason the zucchini wasn't seasoned and the veggies were separated. But as far as I could tell the flavors all merged and coking wasn't affected by being separated so now I think it is silly to have the zucchini and carrots separated. Put the zucchini in the seasoning along with the carrots put veggies on parchment paper top with fish fold and bake.",
