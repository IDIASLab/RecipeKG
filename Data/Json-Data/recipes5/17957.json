Therefore I have adapted the recipe just a bit to acomodate canning the cabbage.  First I increased the recipe by 6.  Also I added 1 quart of my homemade applesauce which does include some sugar and cinnamon.  I used cider vinegar because it is not quite so strong, and I added caraway seed, ( about 2 Tablespoons) to the recipe.  I do not add the butter because I am canning the cabbage and sometimes giving it as gifts to my husbands Checz family. The butter though should be added upon heating as it does add so much to the flavor.  An excellent recipe, and I do find it to be too tart.",
