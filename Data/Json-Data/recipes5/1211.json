I made it without the chives since I don't have them either. I did use 10 eggs instead of 8. The next time I make it, I will probably use sausage instead of bacon, and I will use a dozen eggs as even ten wasn't quite enough. I did use the cheddar cheese , but I topped it off with a shaved Mexican 4 cheese mix. I think the possibilities are endless as to what you would like to use for toppings. Enjoy!",

I will add more eggs in the future because I didn t have quite enough to adequately cover all of the potatoes (maybe I flattened too much?). Also would suggest really undercooking your eggs because they re going into a very hot oven to cook for another 8-10 minutes so you might end up with rubbery scrambled eggs if overcooked. This one s a keeper and I can see this as a good breakfast for overnight visitors.",
