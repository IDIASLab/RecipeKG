I will however next time making this use less cheese as I thought it was too rich and somewhat over powering the other flavors.  Also, to make the prep easier with the quinoa, just add 1/2 cup water to the 1/4 cup quinoa, bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer for 15mins.  This way, the liquid absorbs on its own, and you don't have to drain it if you don't have a fine mesh strainer, much easier and quicker to do.",

I QUADRUPLED it to make about 4 \u2013 5 servings.  I use pre-rinsed quinoa, so I followed the cooking directions on the box for 1 cup (dry) of quinoa.  I used pine nuts (which I\u2019m crazy about) and parmesan cheese.  Next time I will add the nuts with the garlic and cook for only 2 minutes because I was afraid of the nuts getting too brown.  I did not quadruple the olive oil and lemon juice, though.  I still used only 3 Tbsp. olive oil and about 1 Tbsp. lemon juice.  And I used 2 large garlic cloves.  Thank you, thank you for this amazing recipe!!",

Such simple ingredients turn into an amazing dish that I would eat as a main course not just a side dish. I used half the olive oil and half the cheese called for (grated parmesan romano blend) to save quite a few calories and still get the same flavor. Because I cut out half of the salty cheese, I ground sea salt and fresh pepper to add just before I mixed in the spinach. Do Not leave out the lemon juice! It really sets of the flavors of this dish. Also, I used pine nuts since so many people recommended it and I'm so happy I did. I could eat this once a week for years to come and hubby agrees!",
