I followed the advice of others and added a 1/3 cup white wine to the poaching liquid and when I did the sauce reduction I also put in a teaspoon or two of the liquid from my jar of capers. I love the way the salmon came out perfect so moist. It was simply scrumptious. I am definitely going to keep this recipe as a family favorite.",
