You'd better be feeding a crowd or do what I did; Keep the topping cheese separate from the mixed dip and dish out about 8-16 oz (a dip size portion) into a small microwave dish. Heat the dip up then put an appropriate portion of the two cheese topping on the top. Cover for a couple of minutes to melt the cheese. Don't heat the dip up with the cheese on it. The cheese ends up all melting into the dip and disappearing. You can dish the refrigerated dip and cheese out for several nights as leftovers. Oh I used a whole package of the taco mix and used pepperjack cheese instead of the monterey. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee. Yummmy yummy!",
