The beans were very very flavorful, but I couldn't help myself...I did drain and rinse the beans.  The liquid they're in just seems too gooey to me.  I used buttered jasmine rice with the beans, and it was a meal we'll definitely repeat.  Also I had to leave out the recaito because my husband and I both have those weird taste buds that make cilantro taste like soap.  Nevertheless, the beans were still perfect for us.  Thanks, Goya!",
