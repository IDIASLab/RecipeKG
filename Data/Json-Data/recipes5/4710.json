I give it five stars because I welcomed no vinegar in this salad! So five stars it is! I love cucumbers prepared this way but never really liked the tang of the vinegar so much. Using lemon juice instead of the vinegar took away the \"puckeriness\" of the vinegar while still contributing just enough tang to give it some dimension. I also loved the addition of the chives something I've never included. Other than using full fat sour cream and adding salt and pepper I stuck to the recipe as written and found it perfect.

Since I had to go the store for sour cream and chives anyway I figured I could pick up a couple of brand new cucumbers while I was at it. Well neither of the two stores I went to had any fresh chives. I wasn't about to embark on one of my 3-hour ingrediemt searches so I ended up using green onions that I diced up finely instead. I also used 2 cucumbers which I seeded with a melon baller before slicing (they were in little half-moon shapes but I didn't think that would matter much) and all the juice from a whole lemon. We absolutely loved this salad. Nexti time I see chives at the store I will pounce on them and make this salad again. Thanks so much for the post!",
