In fact, I just made a little bit for my lunch today using GF spaghetti (can't get GF bucatini pasta). I did have problems getting the technique down the first few times I made it as the cheese was just glumping up on me instead of being more like a cream (still delicious with the little glumps of cheese here and there). After some time and much trial and error I have it down pat to the way it's written. If you find it tricky making this, try adding a little pasta water to bottom of dish first, then add your pasta, and put the finely grated pecorino romano on top and stir with a fork, adding a little more of the pasta water as needed. Delicious and a favorite quick meal in our house to this day! Thank you for the recipe and for all the help you gave us in making this recipe successfully BQ, to Bikerfamily for making this recipe in which we otherwise would not have discovered it before publication, and to DIZ for sharing in our crazy 'must master Cacio e Pepe' adventure!  :-)",

My secret to success is a combination of gradual addition of the cheese, using residual heat to melt it, and gradual addition of water. Do follow the advice of putting a bit of the water first, then the pasta then the cheese and add more water by 1/2 tbs as needed. My only \"tool\" was mixing in the same Teflon pot where I cooked the pasta and stirring with a silicon fork. I simply removed some pasta the water I needed for the recipe, poured the rest and left just a little then proceeded as described. The pasta was creamy and delicious! Will absolutely make it again as it is a very quick, easy, and satisfying dish good for lunch or dinner! You can try linguini if it happens that you can't find bucatini or found out at the last minute that you didn't have spaghetti.",
