Reminds me of the traditional Midwestern macaroni salad my grandmother made when I was a kid. This is no nonsense....no relish no red or green peppers no pimentos no eggs and no sugar. I'm sure you could add one or more of the above BUT there is no need for it. The green onion makes the salad crunchy and the last minutes addition of the bacon makes this a true winner. I will repeat what another reviewers said \"I will never again buy premade grocery store macaroni salad\". Additionally a nice change from the oil and vinegar-based pasta salads that I have been making.",

Mural of Flavor seasoning -salt free (from Penzey's Spices)Just bought it and thought it would add that little something I think some people said it was missing no salt all other ingredients stayed the same It made about 1/2 gallon of salad. Very colorful and I'm waiting till flavors meld and it sits in refrigerator before adjusting seasonings if needed.",
