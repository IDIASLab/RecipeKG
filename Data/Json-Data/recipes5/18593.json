Didn't give it 5 stars because it needs less sugar - maybe 1/3 cup next time - and more milk - at least 2 cups.  Used quick oats instead of rolled.  This was so good that I actually saved the leftovers (who saves leftover oatmeal???) and warmed it in the microwave with extra milk the next day.",

Make sure you whisk the egg well and continue to stir as the heat rises. You can cut the sugar back to 1/4 or 1/3 cup. 1/2 would be way too sweet.  As written it makes two good sized bowls or 3 quite small servings. This is the best oatmeal we've ever had :)",

I used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar and it was \"just right\".  I added raisins during the cooking in order to soften them, rather than adding them after cooking. To cut calories, use brown sugar Splenda and egg substitute and low fat milk.  This is a very versatile recipe, so on future oatmeal mornings, I'm going to try adding 1/4 cup chopped apples and a 2 Tbsps of pecans and a tsp of cinnamon, or put sliced bananas on the oatmeal after cooking.  Try this recipe and you will NEVER eat instant oatmeal again (ugh). Make this the night before, put it in the fridge and heat it up in the microwave the the morning. Thanks for a great recipe!!",

So I use 1 cup Vanilla Almond Breeze, 3/4 cup water, only 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 cup of oats, and no butter.  It comes out very creamy, plenty sweet.
