Next time, I'll leave the salt out entirely and add it to taste after baking.  The bake time of 20 minutes was perfect for runny yolks, but I went to 25 minutes for a slightly firmer yolk, as is my preference. I recommend a good sharp cheddar--as that adds a ton of flavor--and some chopped parsley added at the end doesn't hurt either. This was so easy to make, nice and cheesy, and a perfect breakfast alongside some toast and tomatoes! I will definitely be making this frequently! Thank you!",
