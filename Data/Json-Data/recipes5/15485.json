We made taco seasoning by Bill Echols and divided it equally between the sour cream and the bean dip. We didn't have garlic salt so we sprinkled garlic powder and sea salt on the mashed avocado and mixed it all together with the lemon juice. A little too much lemon juice but that may have been our fault because we squeezed the juice from 1 really small lemon and didn't measure. The lemon added a really nice flavor to this. Didn't use velveeta we used about 6 oz of shredded cheddar instead. We made this in a round pyrex pie plate it was the perfect size. 4.5 stars",
