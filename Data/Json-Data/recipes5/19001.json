I had bonesless short ribs but this was the recipe I wanted to use. I only used one cup of sweeteners (about 7/8 cup of brown sugar and a tablespoon or so of honey) and went short on the sesame oil. I only marinated this for 8 hours and the taste was very delicious. I loved how they grill because you get crunchy parts on the edges and the insides were perfectly medium rare and perfect. I served this over sticky rice a perfect complement to the meat! I have more to BBQ waiting for us and I can't wait! Thanks for this recipe!",
