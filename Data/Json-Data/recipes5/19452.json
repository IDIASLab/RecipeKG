The more I ate it the more I liked it as is. I took the recipe submitter's advice and made it with arugula since it is readily available in my local grocery store. The salty gorgonzola compliments the sweet pecans and peppery arugula perfectly. I liked how the pecans were toasted with the egg white mixture. They turn out really crunchy. Next time I will add a bit more cayenne since I couldn't really taste any spicyness. For optimum flavor make sure you get a piece of pecan and some gorgonzola in each bite!",
