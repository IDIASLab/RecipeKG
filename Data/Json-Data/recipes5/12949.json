I used McCormick BBQ seasoning and the mix was really lacking any sweetness. I ended up melting brown sugar a little salt and butter together tossing it with the not-sweet-enough snack mix and throwing it back in the oven at 250 for 45 minutes (tossing every 15 minutes). Totally corrected for the seasoning issue!",
