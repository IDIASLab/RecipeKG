I have to admit I tried it because it was low in cholesterol - no eggs but I really think it needs at least egg whites to make it a little fluffy and I didn't have pineapple to use as was required by several other recipes. It is incredibly dense although it is also very moist. However it truly is not very much like cake. I never should have doubled the recipe but I wanted to make a bundt cake. The directions say to use an 8-inch round cake pan. It would have to be a VERY deep pan to accommodate the recipe as written. I had so much batter after doubling the recipe that I was able to make a bundt cake AND an 8-inch square cake. The bundt cake took about an hour to bake which is to be expected. Pick inserted in several places passed the \"cake is done\" test. I sent the entire bundt cake to work with my husband to share and he said everyone devoured it. My husband said he ate it because he liked the cream cheese frosting I put on it. There is no accounting for why anyone else ate it so I gave it 3 stars. However I really wanted to give the recipe 0 stars or just 1 star. I really would suggest that you try a different recipe unless you happen to like an extremely dense cake. Although being so dense it was no problem removing it from the bundt pan!",

I recommend using larger than a 9\" pan as it rises too high to cook thoroughly without slightly burning. It took a full hour with a slight burn with the 9\".. probably 45 minutes in a rectangular one or two loaf pans would work perfectly. I really enjoyed the crispy outside but of course that turned into more 'moist' after i wrapped it for the night.. so i recommend baking it the day of. It was still quite moist although i added a few things like the prev recommendations: 2 cups of milk 1/4 cup oil and a 1/4 cup of applesauce (healthier) an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar.. it ended up nice and slightly sweet the orange was subtle the cinnamon too:) Def make again!!",
