I cooked them until the tops were brown and they were soft. I combined them with a ripe avocado half a bunch of cilantro salt lime and 1/4 of a white onion in the blender. I omitted garlic because I find garlic to overpower the other flavors even though I usually love garlic. The resulting salsa is amazing!!",
