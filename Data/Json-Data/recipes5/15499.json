Much to my surprise after the time in the slow cooker the roast was no where near tender enough to shred with a fork. I had to put it in the pressure cooker for about 1/2 hour-ish to make it shreddable. I then seasoned with the remaining taco seasoning. I guess we're spoiled with ground beef in our tacos. We didn't care much for this. Even my deer hunting venison-lovin' husband wasn't a fan. Sorry.",
