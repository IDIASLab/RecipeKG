        "description": "We. Love. Squash. Simple, with only 3 other ingredients, besides salt and pepper, this recipe sets off the delicious, slightly sweet flavor of crookneck or summer squash. Mom used to stew squash, but this vegetable releases a lot of water when it cooks, so I don't add any water. The long, slow cooking helps to release the natural sugars in the onion and the squash. You can add additional herbs or seasonings, if you like, or cook it for less time to make it firmer, but this is how we do it. Just squash.",

I selected this recipe tonight just to get my ratio of  onions to squash clear. And yes I changed it, I added more onions.  \n\nA short-coming of the recipe was no reference to the fact that it is cooked and turned frequently  to mix a browned (caramelized) layer and flavor into the whole end result. And that cannot be done in 15 to 20 minutes. To evaporate all the excess water and carefully brown the squash takes an hour!",
