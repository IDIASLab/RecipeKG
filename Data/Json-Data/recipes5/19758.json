The only thing wrong with these is that the maple flavor isn't all that present...you can taste a delightful hint of it in the bars, but they aren't extremely maple-y. I may decide to add some maple flavoring to the next batch I make, because adding more syrup would mess too much with the texture of the filling. I lined my baking pan with Reynold's release foil so that I could just take the whole section of cooled bars right out of the pan for ease of cutting. I did cut them into triangles instead of one inch squares...I thought they looked prettier that way. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...it's a winner!",

Here are my additions: 1). doubled batch; 2). used 1/3 brown and 1/3 white sugar in the dough; 3). added 1/3 c. shredded coconut and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the topping; 4). lined the pan with foil and lightly coated with Wilson's Cake Release; 5). Immediately after removing from oven I sprinked lightly and evenly with miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips (don't spread when they melt - just let them 'dot' the cookies with little bursts of chocolate).\n\nAfter cooling almost completely; the bars cut beautifully!\n\nFor first time shortbread makers - let the butter come to room temperature naturally - don't try to microwave it. Then cut the sticks into little cubes, and sprinkle the cubes into the flour/sugar mixture as you're mixing it. Mix on low to medium speed and don't overmix. Taking this extra care with the butter and using a standing mixer will make a beautiful dough that is evenly incorporated, allowing you to just lift the dough out and press right into the pan.",

In future i will make 2 trays worth. If i do that i would double the shortbread crust and triple the filling. I found the crust was perfect for 12 cupcake size bites but i could have used a bit more filling. Seriously good. You have to try this easy and addicting treat!",
