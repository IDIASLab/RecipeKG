                "reviewBody": "Good cooking method, but the original recipe is not so tasty.  Made this to a T the first time and all I tasted was taco seasoning, taking away from the nice, sweet flavor of the sweet potato. So since then, I've tossed the potatoes in a large ziploc bag, drizzled with olive oil (about 1-2 tablespoon), and lightly sprinkle with kosher salt, sometimes with pepper if the kids aren't eating and toss to coat.  I bake the first 20 min. on 400, last 15-20 min. on 425.  1 hour is too much and burns them.  I've dipped these in ranch sauce (kid's fav), garllic aioli or just eat plain.  Good way to get the kids to eat sweet potatoes without frying - full of vitamin A and beta carotene.  Also great with steak dinners.  2 stars for original recipe - 5 stars with changes. Tip - put a greased sheet of foil on your cookie sheet - no sticking and no mess.",

Didn't even need to flip them; the top was crispy enough. My suggestions pretty much go along with the rest listed in the reviews:\n\nCook at a lower temp ~ between 400-425 (NOT 450!)\nI cut them into approx. 1/4\" sticks (regardless of the size, I still think a lower temp is necessary to stop burning).\nI just used kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, olive oil..tossed in a bowl to coat.  No extra spices.\nMost certainly coat your cookie sheets with oil and you really do need to put them in single layers.\n\nFollow these tips, and you should enjoy crispy, healthy, tasty sweet potato fries!",

Also lowered the temperature to 400F for the first 30 minutes and turned it up to 425F for the last half of baking.  The key to keeping these from sticking is spraying the pan with cooking spray - I had no troubles.  They were soft and crispy all at once and were fantastic paired with the Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers from this site.  Definitely recommend these fries, and don't be afraid to play with the seasonings to suit your taste!",

Also, instead of using the spices the recipe called for, I used old bay seasoning (it's all I had at the time - and it's what I'll use from now on!) and everyone loved them!

They weren't as crispy as deep fried one but they had a slightly crisp exterior. The second time I made them I steamed the potato sticks until nearly done then put them in the over for about 20 minutes. Much quicker and they seemed to crisp up more. DH loved them! Great dipped in cranberry-mustard sauce. Just mix canned cranberry with a good quality mustard. Honey-mustard is my favorite. Thanks for sharing!",
