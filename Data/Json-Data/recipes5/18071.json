I halved the recipe but only used a total of 3 cans of beer instead of six. I marinated the ribs in a Ziploc freezer bag with two cans of beer and used one in the sauce. It was very runny at first even after cooking for the prescribed time. I put the rest of the sauce in a foil-wrapped pan on my grill and allowed it to thicken up as the ribs cooked. By the time the ribs were finished the sauce was nice and thick. This sauce has a wonderful barbecue flavor.",
