I used 1/2 white & 1/2 whole wheat flour added 3 tbsp applesauce in lieu of margarine/oil added 1 tbsp ground flax seed used twice as many walnuts added an extra splash of vanilla and didn't use any raisins. For those interested I timed the cooking and it took one loaf 37-40 minutes with no burnt top and a moist inside. NOTE: The whole wheat flour makes it a more dense bread and the lack of oil/margarine affects the consistency but neither change the good taste!",
