To make the roasted garlic easier to use, I just smushed it with the back of a spoon into a paste, then mashed it into the butter before adding the butter to the skillet, then the broccoli (I skipped the browned garlic step). I did add just a touch of crushed red pepper when I added the fresh ground black pepper. This was delicious. My one issue with this recipe is there wasn't enough for bigger servings, we all wanted more. Next time, I'd double the recipe in the beginning.",

It's best straight from the pan to the plate to your mouth, so make it your last item removed from the stove. I gave it 5 stars because overall the recipe title says it all- it's easy to prepare, lemony, and garlicy.\r\n\r\nEdited: after making this recipe multiple times (we LOVE broccoli!), I now steam my broccoli in a steamer basket instead of cooking it in a pan. (I didn't like that the broccoli turned brown). I pour my lemon juice over the broccoli and leave it to steam. When finished, I place the steamed broccoli in a glass pyrex bowl and squeeze 1/2 fresh lemon over it, pour the melted butter & slightly browned garlic directly in the bowl, cover, shake and serve. DELICIOUS!",

The only thing I changed was cutting the black pepper in half. I also only needed to cook the butter garlic sauce for 4 minutes and the garlic was golden browned. I weighed the 1 lb of broccoli out and it came to 7 3/4 cup of fresh brocoli florets. I put them in a pan with 3\" sides to steam. I felt the steaming method with so little water was literally dry steaming. For that reason the larger pieces stay a bright green but the smaller ones get a little browned. I might tinker with that a bit next time. I would also like to see if a lighter sat fat version of butter will work like butter with olive oil or canola oil blend. As is though I ate 2 servings and had to stop myself! As it cooks down a little this will only yield about 2 good sized servings. Thanks!",
