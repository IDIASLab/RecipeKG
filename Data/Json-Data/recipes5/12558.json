I bought a very large wholesale club bag of \"fingerling\" potatoes and wasn't quite sure what to do with them. This recipe is perfect. I quarter the potatoes lengthwise put everything in a large bowl toss it all together (except the cheese)and bake it in a greased 13 X 9 pan. Be sure to use the \"kosher salt\" as called for - it is very coarsely ground and has about 1/2 the sodium per tablespoon as regular salt. Or if you do not have kosher salt on hand and are using regular salt cut the salt to 1/2 a tablespoon. The cheddar cheese sprinkled on top at the end makes these really delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I loved the onions I would cut them in bigger chunks next time. I threw in about 6 whole cloves of garlic crushed under the side of my knife (in addition to the garlic powder). Those were delicious too! I only used 4 pretty small Yukon golds so I only used 2 TBS of oil and this was too much- would only add 1 TBS next time. I reduced the salt quite a bit- just sprinkled some on. The cheese (I used sharp cheddar) is a nice touch but it would be good without it too. I was making roast beef at the same time so I baked these at 350 for over an hour. I think I will keep this method and try different spice/herb combos. Thanks for the recipe!",
