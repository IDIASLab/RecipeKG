Easy to make too but do use your time well (i.e. cut the other veggies while the spaghetti squash is in the IP). I didn't have cherry tomatoes and chopped a couple of small plum tomatoes from my garden. My zucchini waived goodbye and I decided to add in some frozen broccoli/cauliflower before adding in the tomatoes (just put glass lid on top of IP for about 5 minutes and stirred intermittently). Otherwise I followed the recipe instructions and ingredient amounts exactly and both of us loved the flavor of this dish a lot. It's very filling delicious healthy and perfect for a meatless main dish. Thank you for the recipe Bibi!",
