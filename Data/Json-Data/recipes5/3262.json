I made it a couple of years ago for a birthday brunch for my mother, and people still ask me for the recipe! It\u2019s wonderful as is, but since I like to throw it together fairly often, sometimes I don\u2019t always have all the ingredients. I omit the Swiss and the chestnuts sometimes, and I do vary the fruit a bit. I like to use red and green grapes, just for a little color variation. I\u2019ve also added diced green apple with scrumptious results. If you don\u2019t like mayo (like me) a nice light variation is to use half Miracle Whip and half sour cream or plain yogurt. There is so much flavor with the fruit and veggies, the dressing doesn\u2019t need to be so mayo-y. This is amazing just plain, or on a toasted bagel or croissant. Once you try this one, no other chicken salad will suffice!",
