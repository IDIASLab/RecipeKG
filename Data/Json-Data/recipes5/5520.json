One very important thing is to be sure you buy FRESH mozzarella cheese (not the kind you get sliced i.e. american swiss etc). Your Italian supermarket OR any large chain supermarket will carry this type at their deli counter. When ordering be sure to tell them you want the fresh kind. My guests and my family liked this recipe.",
