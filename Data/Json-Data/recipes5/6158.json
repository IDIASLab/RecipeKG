It had a tex-mex taste to it, perhaps the cumin and parsley gave it that twang.  :-)   I tasted it immediately after mixing all the ingredients and then let it sit in the fridge for an hour before serving.  It is definitely much more flavourful after melding.  Its flavour is not overbearing in any way.  I served this with a light quiche type savoury pie and it was a perfect compliment.  I will serve it on a bed of spinach leaves the next time!  Thank you Manella for sharing.",

Simple, inexpensive, quick to put together and it uses ingredients that I always have on hand. The cumin gives it a nice Moroccan twist and because I love cumin, I did add an extra half teaspoon and I might try a pinch of cinnamon next time. I also used green onion instead of the white and will try it with a red onion next time.  This one is a keeper!",
