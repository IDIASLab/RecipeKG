I followed the recipe for the most part but adjusted the amounts of a few ingredients cutting back fairly significantly on the crushed red pepper flakes (to about 1/8 tsp.) the artichoke hearts (about half the amount called for) and the lemon juice (again about half the directed amount). Delicately flavored with a beautiful and elegant presentation. I served this with grilled chicken but this could easily stand on its own. (Note: If your pasta is dry it is easily remedied by adding some of the reserved pasta cooking water)",

I think really small mods - but this dish was a hit and a certain keeper!!! Thanks Rentsch!",

I would also use uncooked shrimp because the cooked shrimp get overcooked before everything is warm enough. This is always a fast and delicious meal.",
