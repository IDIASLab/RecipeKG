I didn\u2019t boil the carrots, rather, steamed them in the microwave for 3 minutes and reserved the necessary water for the sauce.  When you add the water to the mayonnaise mixture, your sauce will be fairly thin, but it thickens up after coming out of the oven.  I left my carrots in the oven for 8 minutes to get some color on the breadcrumbs (I used Italian panko).  We LUV carrots in this house, and this was not only a quick and easy side dish, but most importantly, a very tasty one.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it will be made again, we thoroughly it!",
