If you have a food processor, I'd recommend you use it rather than a blender.  The drained garbanzos do not process well in the blender even after adding some of the reserved bean liquid...I switched to the FP.   OK, but not one of my favorites, but I definitely like the way this breaks down nutritionally, 5 stars for that.  Thanks for sharing htiz.",

Such an easy, quick snack. \nThe 1st black bean hummus recipe on this website adds cayenne, paprika & Greek olives to this recipe. I think I might try that next time. LOVE THIS RECIPE",

When my husband tasted it he asked where the fajitas were, so I broke out the tortillas and ended up smothering it in jalape\u00f1os and served some salsa and guac on the side. I used Chef John's Tahini instead of regular and much more of it than 1 tsp. so yes, this is a very good recipe but I wouldn't consider it a replacement for traditional hummus. Thank you for the recipe.",
