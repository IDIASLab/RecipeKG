Had 1/2 lb of nettles but since we wound up with more than 2 cups of chicken broth (the can we had was around 20-22 oz) I used the full 1/4 cup of rice and the whole medium onion to thicken it a bit. This is a nice simple recipe which has an unexpected depth of flavor. It made our first experience with actually EATING stinging nettles (rather than simply getting stung by them) a very good one. We'll definitely make this again!",
