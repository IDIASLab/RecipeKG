The main thing I didn't care for is that it turned out all the same color. I wanted to add something like red bell pepper or tomatoes or something with color. Honey Mustard II from this site would have been a good mix with this. When I actually ate it I added Tajin and more salt and pepper. It resembles other recipes here for chicken salad that add more spices. This is a nice beginning and I liked that the submitter mentioned how easy it would be to make everything ahead of time especially for a major event. It sounds like I didn't care for this but it certainly did make me a nice dinner. Thanks jsmisek!",
