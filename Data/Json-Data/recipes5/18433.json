It was soo good that you didn't even care if your meat was rather tough but next time I'll save the round steak for a crockpot recipe & top a N.Y. Strip w/ this delicious sauce. The only changes I made to the recipe were cutting back just a tad on the mustard in the sauce (I didn't have sweet/spicy mustard so I added a bit of honey to spicy brown mustard) & I used real bacon bits instead of frying bacon. I did cook my steaks in just a little bacon grease though. Will have the sauce again on a better cut of meat...thanks!",

Also I added a few sliced mushrooms saute in the sauce and it turned out really well. Go easy on the Rosemary three tablespoons is too much. One or two works or just eyeball it.",
