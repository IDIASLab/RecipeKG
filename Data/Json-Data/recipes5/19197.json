I would make one minor suggestion though (for those who like cinnamon), I would add a full teaspoon of cinnamon, rather than the 1/8th. The extra cinnamon gives the muffins a nice sweetness. Personally, the original recipe isn't sweet enough for me, but the full teaspoon of cinnamon makes it perfect.   Lastly, I know cooking times do vary based upon location and glassware/cookware, but it took a full 30 mins for the centers of the muffins to be cooked fully (rather than the 20 mins suggested).   P.S. The topping is soo yummy and sweet (must be the full tablespoon of cinnamon ;-) I could eat the topping just like that",

When adding the topping it would be helpful to press it in to the batter a bit as a lot of mine fell off while removing muffins from tin. These are tasty but a touch plain. They are good as is or would be the perfect base for any dried fruit (i like craisins) shredded coconut fresh berries more spices or pineapple. Great recipe!",
