                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe! My husband and I both LOVED it! As usual I did have to make a few changes. Since I had no jarred applesauce (I usually make my own) I quickly peeled cored and chunked 3 Granny Smiths and cooked them on low for l5 mins. with 3 Tab. white sugar & a dash of lemon juice (tender stage) and \"smashed\" them a little but did leave small chunks for extra flavor. This made a perfect substitute! My only canned peaches were sweetened with Splenda and they worked fine. I did cut each slice into 3rds(fits into the mouth better). Could not locate 8 oz. can of pineapple chunks in my grocery store so used tidbits instead and they worked fine. I had a can of \"lite\" apple pie filling in my pantry (impulse buy) that needed to be used so I tossed that in. The end result had a wonderful texture and taste! Next time I will probably add a can of pear halves drained and chunked. This would make a beautiful presentation at a holiday meal because it is so colorful! It does make a lot (almost filled up my 13x9 dish) but you can enjoy it in a variety of ways. I warmed it and served it with teacakes as dessert ate it as a side dish and will serve it over pound cake slices with whipped topping for dessert tonight. Also it will be wonderful with vanilla ice cream. A delicious and versatile dish! Thanks for the recipe!",

I am not sure why anyone wouldn't like it. It tastes exactly like a wonderful warm fruit pie without the crust. It is also actually pretty healthy! (Well there is some sugar due to the canned fruit). The only thing I added was canned pears because I thought it would make a nice addition the other fruits. I really loved this recipe and would make again! I think it would go great over pancakes!
