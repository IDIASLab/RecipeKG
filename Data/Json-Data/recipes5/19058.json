These strawberry fritters make my mouth water, they are so good. I love the combination of airy, crisp pastry, with lightly cooked fresh strawberries, and rich chocolate sauce.",

Kind of like a funnel cake coating with a strawberry inside. Making them I halved the strawberries after cutting the tops off. The batter to coat them was VERY thick. I finally just got my hands in there and got messy trying to coat the strawberries then just dropped blobs of batter with strawberry into the hot oil. Eating them I wasn't sure if I liked the warm strawberry or not...it is kind of a taste sensation! I loved the chocolate sauce and pwdrd sugar and whipped cream all of that went together wonderfully with the coating...I am just not sure if I like a warm strawberry LOL! But 5 stars for such an original and fun recipe to make thanks so much Austin! I can't wait to make more of your recipes! Tan",

Also I think instead of semi-sweet that dark chocolate would add a little more contrast. I plan on making this again and changing the ratio of dry to wet to make it a thicker batter with still a lot of taste. Great alternative to cakes or chocolate covered strawberries!",
