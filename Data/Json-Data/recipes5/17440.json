Doubled the raisins and left them whole. Tossed in a coarsely chopped onion when I returned the chicken to simmer. One drop red and two drops yellow food coloring stirred in really brought out the color. Served it over lightly buttered white rice with the orange slice atop the chicken and a maraschino cherry half in the center of the orange slice. Presentation was GORGEOUS and the taste is unbelievable. You never taste the bourbon! But it really lends flavor. We ate the whole thing which should have been enough for two meals. This has got to be just about my favorite dish! And you never miss the fat. DE-LISH!!!!",
