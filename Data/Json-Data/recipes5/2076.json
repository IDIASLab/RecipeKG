ALSO if you are interested in baking your own dog biscuits I have some excellent tips in an AR blog that I have written.",

They rolled out so nice and smooth, i wish some other recipes were so easy to make as these were. As for the taste, they must have been yummy as my dog quickly downed it. Instead of squares i made little round ones, they make a good size batch, i will freeze the rest to keep them fresh and thaw a few out when needed!!",

Had some bananas that were going to go bad soon so I mashed one of those into the applesauce/egg mixture and added a 1/2 tsp mint extract. Used crunchy PB cause that's what I had on hand. Instructions very clear easy to follow - THANK YOU!! Cut mine with a pizza cutter super quick. I love that these are made with ingredients found in my kitchen and this recipe is forgiving so you can add items without totally messing up the outcome. IF there are any left at the 2 week mark I can always throw the leftovers out to the chickens and make a new batch. But my little girl loves them so I doubt there will be leftovers. Looking forward to trying some of Bries other recipes!!",
