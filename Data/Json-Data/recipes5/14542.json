Because of that I let it cook longer hoping the rice would absorb some of the excess liquid but in doing so I overcooked the rice. Don't make the same mistake I did by reading over the part that the 4 cups of water is divided. This is one I would make again to go along with a Mexican themed meal. I'd like to try it with cilantro instead of parsley.",
