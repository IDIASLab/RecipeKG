        "description": "If nachos and French onion soup had a baby, it'd be this no-fry version of Outback's famous 'Bloomin' Onion.' Though easier to make and way less messy, it tastes every bit as good. Maybe better, since every bite is cooked perfectly crispy. This came out so well, I didn't even think about making a sauce, but anything that pairs well with onions would be good scattered over top of these 'onion nachos.'",

I've never tried the original blooming onion dish but this is like a healthier alternative to onion rings or like he mentions in the vid French onion soup turned into a solid bite.

I used the broiler, but the panko got very brown very quickly, so I think I will bake it in a 400 degree convection oven next time. Also I pre heated my gas broiler, and it reached 400 degrees and turned off before I could finish laying out the onions! \nWhile my guys said that these are not a substitute for a blooming onion or onion rings, as the onions stay soft while the panko is crispy; they are delicious in their own rite! A tasty new way to get your zinc - so important these days!",
