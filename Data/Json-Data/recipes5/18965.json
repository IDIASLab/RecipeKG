I used buttermilk used two packets of organic caramel apple instant oatmeal (my batter seemed a little thin so I folded in another packet) and added a little vanilla and pumpkin pie spice. These cooked up beautifully and I had no issues with pancakes that weren't done in the middle. Both the kids and I loved these and I'll for sure make these again. For those who make these pancakes don't overmix! And this recipe made nine medium pancakes and between my kids and I we ate them all! EDITED TO ADD: These have become my kids' favorite pancakes. My son asks me almost every morning if I'm making \"those really good pancakes\". I can't thank the person who posted this recipe enough. Thank God Walmart has cheap instant oatmeal! EDITED AGAIN: I now make these with whole wheat flour half the sugar a teaspoon of baking powder and buttermilk and organic ingredients if I can. Still one of our favorite pancake recipes.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a good \"base\" recipe that can be easily modified to suit individual tastes. I used mixed berry oatmeal instead of banana. My husband and I both enjoyed the pancakes and they had a nice texture and consistency. They also browned very nicely. My comments are: 1) Instead of using a combination of salt and baking soda I used 1 tsp. of baking powder which provides a little bit more fluffiness; 2) My other pancake recipe uses 1 Tbsp of white sugar for 8 servings so I scaled the sugar back to 1 tsp since the instant oatmeal obviously contains a lot of sugar. I cannot even imagine how unbearably sweet these would have tasted with a full 1/2 c. of brown sugar on top of all of the sugar in the instant oatmeal. For kids who have a sweeter palate I would say maybe 1/8 c. of sugar would be okay but any more than that would be a sugar overload.",

I used a total of 2 cups of regular oatmeal instead of the instant packet. I tried 1 cup but felt it was still too runny. I also added a whole ripe (I mean really ripe to the point where the banana peel is almost all black) banana. I smashed it in with the dry ingredients and then poured that into the wet ingredients. I used a spatula to mix it all up. Delicious! Btw I did not use syrup. The sweetness from the banana was the perfect touch.",

After reading the other reviews, I agreed and used 1/2 the amount of brown sugar and baking powder instead of baking soda and salt, AND I let the oatmeal sit in the milk for 10 minutes before mixing everything else.  Finally (seems I made a lot of changes...) I added some cinnamon to compliment the banana, around a tsp or so.  I used butter flavored Pam cooking spray on the skillet so I could omit buttering them after they were cooked. My boyfriend and me ate them up quick...and my dog really enjoyed the little pancake I made out of the leftover batter! I had no problems with the batter being runny...maybe some of the changes I made fixed that!",
