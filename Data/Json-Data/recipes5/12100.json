I also used less olive oil and broke up 1 Tablespoon of butter for the onion. For a thicker sauce I added 4oz. sliced, cooked white potato. To help the sweetness of the 2 (granny smith) apples (based on the other review of this recipe) I also added  4 oz. sliced, cooked sweet potato. No additional sugar was necessary.  You really can deviate at this point and spice it up with Worcestershire  sauce or Sriracha sauce or even a Teriyaki. My husband liked it and said he'd eat it again. That's really all I'm looking for. Thanks.",

Two bottles seemed too much and as it turned out for me, probably could have just used a half of  bottle because I still had plenty of liquid after simmering for 1 hour.   Removed the sausage and added 2 Tbs. of brown sugar and  a pinch of salt and cranked up the heat for a few minutes to reduce to a syrup for the apple and onions.  Wow!  Yummy!  Considered adding  a dab of butter but it didn't need it.  Wished I'd had a second apple like the recipe stated. Will do next time.",
