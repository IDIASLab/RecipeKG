To those who had trouble getting the sauce to stick to the ribs, try this: put the plain ribs (meat side up, seasoned with salt & pepper) on a rack in a roasting pan.  Cover them super tight with foil, and bake an hour and fifteen minutes at 350.  This will get them nice and tender.  Then, remove them from the pan, drain the fat out of the bottom of the pan, and put the ribs back in the pan (with no rack this time).  Cover them with the cooked sauce, and bake them again, uncovered, for 35 minutes.  The meat will fall off the bone, and the sauce will be thick and yummy.  I do this with pretty much every sauce I try on my ribs, and it really works.  Yum yum yum.  These were so loving, thanks for the recipe!!",
