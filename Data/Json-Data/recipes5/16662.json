I substituted 1/2 a cup of ground flax seed for the oatmeal to give it a more nutty nutritious flavour and substituted the peanut butter with butterscotch chips as there is always a risk of peanut allergies when serving to the public.  Personally I would have preferred the peanut butter, but to be on the safe side. . .  Nice and simple!",

When the oats were nice and soft, I pressed the first half into the pan firmly, then after I added the chocolate I lightly pressed the oatmeal that goes on top into the chocolate. I had very minimal crumbling. Great quick recipe!",

I guess I was expecting something more on the level of a Hello Dolly (aka 7 layer bar). I won't make it again. Also even though it was \"no bake\" it still made plenty of mess on the stovetop and took 2 hours to cool down so it wasn't any easier than oven bars.",
