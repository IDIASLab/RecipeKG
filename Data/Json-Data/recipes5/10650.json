I heated up the broth water and simmer the shells for 10 minutes. I removed the shells and made the broth per the recipe except I substituted dried tarragon (1 tsp) for the fresh tarragon. The shrimp cooked very quickly perhaps 3 minutes. The other modification I made was the Chili Sauce. I didn t want to buy a bottle because I doubt I would use it again. Upon looking up the ingredients online I substituted (more or less) with ingredients I had on hand: 2 Tbsp tomato paste 1 tsp white vinegar and 1 tsp Huy Fong Chile Garlic Sambal.
