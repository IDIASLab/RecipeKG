As well as imparting sharp fresh flavor, the acid in the lemon juice affects the protein in the fish, causing a cooked texture on the surface of the meat whilst leaving the centre rare and soft. Serve with buttered crusty brown toast.",

The texture is firm enough to overcome the eww factor and raw enough to not destroy the raw feeling of the fish. Address the pickle on an as desired basis. If you're not a pickle fan go lighter but don't omit. I've tried this several times because I like sushi but was looking for a less than Japanese way of eating it. This fits the bill perfectly!
