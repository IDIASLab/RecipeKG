It just adds to the whole Mediterranen feel. I love this one. Our family is divided, though. My husband is not an olive fan (and there is no way I'm skimping on those yummy kalamatas), and my youngest son is sort of picky, but my oldest son and I LOVE it. I think it would make a great sauce for pasta also.",

I did change three things though- I used regular onion a lot fewer Kalamata olives (I was afraid it would make it too salty) maybe half what it says- and fewer capers (about 2 Tbsp)- again afraid of the salt.

Placed in the oven for the recommended baking time...created the perfect \"crust\".  Crispy on top-moist and flaky on the bottom! I think it's really important to simmer the sauce until reduced by at least half....otherwise too wet. My 4 year old and 8 year old boys LOVED it!  ",
