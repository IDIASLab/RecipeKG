I would definitely suggest baking the popcorn on a cookie sheet covered with foil, in a 200 degree oven for approximately 20 minutes to crisp it up a bit.  Otherwise it is extremely gooey.  Also, I made two batches for a crowd and had better luck on my second batch where I used one bag of popcorn for the amount of sauce the recipe says should be used for 2 bags.  I think it was much easier to coat and came out yummier with twice the sauce.  Also, I added slightly more peanut butter for the second batch, but I am a peanut butter lover.  This recipe would be great to add salted peanuts to.",

                "reviewBody": "I have made this a couple times now. First time was to fill X-mas tins as party gifts over the holidays and now for a summer barbecue/picnic. It's very easy but as others have suggested it needs to be baked to prevent soggy gooey popcorn. I baked it at 250 degrees for 30 minutes stirring once in the middle. The first time I made it I didn't think it had enough of a peanut butter taste (tasted too much like caramel corn with a subtle peanut butter flavor which was fine but I wanted something more flavorful and different from the caramel corn I had also made). So the second time I made it I increased the peanut butter to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of peanuts too and it turned out perfect! I have popped my own popcorn both times with coconut oil (only the BEST oil to use and it gives the most amazing flavor). If you like chocolate and peanut butter flavors together you can drizzle melted chocolate over the mix after it cools or try what I did which was to make the Chocolate Popcorn recipe from this site that was submitted by sueb leave out the peanuts in it and after both batches cool mix them together. It makes for a fun mix! Thanks for sharing!",

But I feel this recipe is only worth it if you go the extra step and put it in the oven to dry it out and crisp it up for a half and hour or so. When you let it cool which is very hard to do it turns into a wonderful carmel corn. I love to make this recipe with the \"microwave popcorn\" recipe from this site. Gotta try it. If you don't do the oven step then it is just too gooey and sticky and I would only give it two stars.",

I put 15 individually wrapped caramels in my bowl and melted them in the microwave with a little water. Then I added slightly more than 1/4 cup peanut butter 19 marshmallows (didn't have 20!) only 2 T butter and only 1/4 c. of light brown sugar. I also added walnuts. I also followed the suggestion of crisping it in the oven on 200 F for 20 minutes in foil-lined pans. Yum! I could see drizzling this with almond bark next time or adding chocolate chips or another kind of nut. I did use 2 bags of microwave popcorn and thought that it was the perfect amount of coating while still letting the popcorn flavor come through.",
