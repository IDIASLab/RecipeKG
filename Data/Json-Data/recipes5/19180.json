I got just a small taste as they were eaten up very quickly! Very sloppy joe-like but different from the Manwich I typically use for a quick meal. Thanks Kendra:) UPDATE I made these again tonight and once again I only had one pound of hamburger. However I forgot to halve the rest of the ingredients and they still turned out great! Since they were extra sloppy we used the potato chips I had made to go with it as scoops. This leads me to believe this would be great over mashed potatoes or wide noodles for a nice change from buns:)",

I liked that the ingredients are something I always have on hand but I had to almost double the sauce ingredients. When I got to the simmering part the meat tasted a little bland and was so void of liquid it wouldn't hold together. Afraid of it burning while it sat there for 20 minutes I threw in some more of each ingredient and added some garlic powder as well. I would make this again if I needed something to throw together but I don't find myself serving it to company or adding it to my cooking repertoire on a regular basis.",
