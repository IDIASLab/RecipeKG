If you are like me and prefer your tuna medium rare cook as the recipe suggests. My husband likes it a bit more well-done so we just put his back on the heat. (But keep in mind if you let your tuna sit/rest 3 to 5 minutes off of the stovetop it will continue to cook a bit more from its own internal heat. That way you can be assured that it won't get dry from overcooking which is always a concern with seafood.) This recipe is a keeper. It's the second time I've made it this month.",

I think it cooks the tuna for too long at too low a heat, so it ends up overcooked and tasting somewhat like canned tuna. We did not marinade the tuna for a whole 20 minutes (due to time constraints), but otherwise followed the recipe perfectly. I'm glad we didn't marinate it any longer, otherwise I think all we would have tasted is soy sauce. The marinade was very salty and really clung to the tuna steak. I would advise rinsing off the marinade thoroughly before cooking to avoid a too strong soy sauce flavor. Unfortunatly, I would actually just skip this recipe all together.",
