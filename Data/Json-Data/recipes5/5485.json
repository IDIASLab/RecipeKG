I think with a little tweaking it could be a five (maybe make a homemade graham cracker crust instead of store bought, omit/reduce the powdered sugar as it is really sweet to my taste buds at least).  The lemony flavor is not as strong as you would think considering - I think that maybe because the sweetened condense milk sweetness just dominates.  As it is it's good though.",
