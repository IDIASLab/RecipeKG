A suggestion for the reviewer that said it wasn't getting done in the middle: When cooking the zucchini and onion, be sure allow the liquid to evaporate almost completely! Have had this problem with another zucchini recipe, but this does the trick. Thanks, Mrs. Walter, for the recipe.",

I read all the reviews and took some advice.  I added some minced garlic to the zucchini were cooking. I also added some parm cheese to the egg and cheese mixture. I also followed someone else's advice and let the veggies cool a little before I mixed it with the egg and cheese. This is a keeper, which is great because we have so many Zucchini. I just made this again last night. This time I added fresh tomatoes to half to try it out. Hubby loved it.",
