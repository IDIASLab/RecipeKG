My husband doesn't like salmon, and was really disappointed when I told him that was for supper(I buy salmon for me and the girls-NOT for him) but since I'm out of groceries and this was all I had, I looked here for a really good salmon recipe. This one worked, he ate the fish, and said it was really good, \"where did you get that recipe?\". Here's a tip: Let the salmon sit in the sauce for at least 10 minutes before you serve it- it soaks it up and makes it moist- the fillets I took out and plated right  as soon as it came out of the oven were kinda dry, but the ones that I was putting away after supper were super moist and flavorful.\nThanks for making my husbands salmon dinner a pleasant experience!!",

I boiled the onions in the vinegar/brown sugar...waiting for the \"sauce\" to reduce...it doesn't. So after about 45 minutes or so I just spooned some of the liquid over the salmon along with the onions. The sauce which pooled around the bottom of the salmon burned onto my pan creating a lot of smoke; we couldn't taste the garlic butter at all (just added calories IMHO - you could omit this and I'm surprised nobody else mentioned it); and in the end the onions were very chewy/sticky...not a nice meal in the least. We will not be making this again.",
