I also cooked the cheese balls in the oven to avoid deep-frying - 350 degrees for 30 min. was all that was needed. I also placed them on parchment paper so I didn't have to grease the pan either. I substituted my own spiced tomato sauce but next time I'll try the one on the recipe. Thanks Debbie!",

I think thre's more flavor with walnuts. Strict carnivores I know don't care for this recipe and my kids hated it. I love this recipe however and so do all my veggie friends. NB: I avoid all frying so I brown the cheese balls in the oven first - 40 min at 350 F. It makes for a lot of oven time but cuts way down on the fat intake.",

I use pecan meal instead of chopped pecans and only 3/4 c bread crumbs. I bake mine for 15 minutes at 350 then cover with store bought or homemade marinara sauce mushroom gravy sweet and sour glaze etc. I bake the sauce covered meatball for 30 minutes at 325. They are wonderful! These make great breakfast patties if you use an ice-cream scoop to scoop them out onto a baking sheet. Then flatten to 1/2 inch thickness. Bake at 325 for 30 minutes. Cool then package 3-4 patties in a zip-lock bag. Nuke about 30 seconds and they are ready to eat!",
