I made a bunch of modifications so that the cookies would be super-appley. They came out ridiculously good. Here's what I did: \n1) Put in about FOUR cups of chopped up apple. I know, craziness. \n2) added about 2 cups of rolled oats (to soak up the extra juice from the apples)\n3) omitted raisins. I am anti-raisin.\n4) doubled the baking soda\n5) doubled all the spices and added a touch of ginger\n6) used greased cookie sheets instead of parchment \n\nThese changes made for some AWESOME cookies. \n\nThen I got more adventurous and for the last tray's worth, I added a handful of coconut. WOW!!! That provided a really neat flavor to meld with the apples and walnuts and all the spices. \n\nMy husband has ordered me to get them out of the house immediately, or he will eat them all. ",

We're dieting at our house and this seemed like a fairly healthy cookie, so I made the following revisions to make it healthier:  whole wheat flour, 2T butter, 1/2 c. applesauce, Splenda brown sugar, 1/2 c. pecans, 2T Cinnamon plus spice blend. I soaked the raisins which helps add moisture to the mix and used an electric chopper to get a finer chop on the apple.  They do have to be formed by hand.  They are a sweet, moist cookie with a good flavor.  We skipped the glaze because they don't need it.  I made a few w/out raisins & nuts for my young girls and they ate them.  And my husband who is picky w/ treats said they tasted healthy, but were really good.  Happy to have found this recipe.  Thanks!",

The kids all prefer craisins, and don't complain when I use wheat flour!  If you do add nuts, pecans tend to have more flavor in cookies, so we choose that over walnuts.  We soak our raisins/craisins in warm water while I'm getting the other ingredients ready which allows them to become nice and fluffy to bring out their flavor instead of biting down on dry fruit you can barely taste.  I've also done this several times w/o cloves.  We love sweets in this house, but can't imagine turning this healthy cookie into something that's not by adding the unnecessary glaze.  This turns out to be really soft and we prefer to store this in the fridge or eat right away.  We found no need to use parchment paper especially if you have any decent baking sheet.  One of the few recipes on this site that is delicious w/o a bunch of revisions.",

I only used half of the flour and for the other half I substituted rolled oats. I left out half of the butter and used applesauce instead. And lastly half of the sugar was changed to sweetener. Maybe that is the reason why my cookies turned out really sweet... too sweet actually. I used the sweetener as advised on the packet the exact amount of the gramms of sugar I wanted and it still didn't work. Maybe next time I won't try to reduce the sugar calories. But overall- loved the cookie!",
