I think there might be an error in the listing of 2 cups of Oil...I did NOT use that much oil to pop the popcorn in. I used my Stir-Crazy popper instead of using a pot to pop it in and 1 cup of unpopped popcorn made plenty. I also added a teaspoon a vanilla when I added the baking soda. Thanks Yvonne...you've given me something new to make now.:O)",

I halved the recipe and the end result was a lot of popcorn that wasn't coated enough with caramel. My peanuts weren't even sticking to the popcorn. I had to go back and make some more caramel to make it look and taste more like Poppycock. The next time I make this I will halve the popcorn but keep the rest of the ingredients as written. As far as the oil goes I think I may have used about 4 TBS for 1&1/2 cups popcorn kernels.",
