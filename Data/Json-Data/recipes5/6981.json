I've never tried it before and despite the price I will definitely be looking for more ways to use that ingredient. On the other hand that dressing as written is one of the worse things I've ever put in my mouth. I ended up mixing a small amount with about 1/2 cup of mayo to dress the salad and the rest went down the drain. This was good but not great overall. Still I can't thank you enough for the introduction to grilled halloumi!",
