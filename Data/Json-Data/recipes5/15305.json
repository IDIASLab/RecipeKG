Things I would do differently:  When I added the two jalape\u00f1os, I discarded all but about a teaspoon of  the seeds, so the dish came out very savory but mild in terms of heat.  Next time, I'll include about a tablespoon of the seeds for more heat, and go up from there.  Also, needed a little more salt.",
