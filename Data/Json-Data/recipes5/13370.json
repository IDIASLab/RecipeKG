It is easy to prepare which is another plus and it has ingredients that I usually have on hand.   I made as directed and in addition, I lined my pan with parchment paper for easy removal.  This took 50 minutes in my convection oven to bake.  It was still jiggly in the middle at 40 minutes so I kept checking at 5 minute intervals.  I'm not a fan of the aftertaste that canned frosting has so I will likely prepare a homemade frosting next time.",
