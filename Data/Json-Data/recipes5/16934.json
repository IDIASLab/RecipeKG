Following the advice of others who reviewed this recipe I substituted half the ketchup with my favorite BBQ sauce. Then I poured a little of the sauce down in the pan before placing the chops in. Finally I covered the pan with foil and baked them for 45 minutes. Perfection. They were so tender they melted in my mouth and my husband and daughter both thought they were absolutely delicious. I will definitely be making this dish again and again. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I also cooked them on the stove top in a non-stick pan. I cooked them covered for about 30 minutes (adjust for thickness of chops) and then cooked at medium high heat for 10 minutes with the top off so the sauce would thicken. You could remove the chops while you thicken the sauce to avoid drying them out.",

Also, if you want the marinade to stay on top of chops, just put a little bit of marinade on bottom so chops don't burn and pack them tightly together without any extra space on the sides. Then pour marinade over and it will come out thick & almost glazed on top. My hubby loved this! Definite keeper! Thank You!!",
