Here are a few tips to cut the prep time:  Oven bake the meatballs at 350 degrees for 20 minutes on a foil lined broiler pan.  The fat melts off, and the meatballs stay firm, instead of crumbling apart.  Cuts down on calories and fat, and improves the taste.  Also, when making the sauce, just dump all the ingredients in a saucepan at the same time, and whisk the heck out of it.  No lumps, and cuts down on dishes.  Enjoy!  We love this recipe!",

Much less messy, and faster too.  I can cook the meatballs in the oven while I do the sauce on the stovetop.  Plus, my meatballs never fall apart this way!\r\n",
