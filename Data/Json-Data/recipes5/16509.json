I doubled everything and got 10 dozen cookies!  Even half of that is 5 dozen!  Here are the changes I made:  I put a teaspoon of vanilla and about a cup of finely chopped pecans in the (doubled) batter,  and after rolling into a one inch ball,  dipped each one half way in a bowl containing Sugar In The Raw.  It's light brown, has larger crystals then regular sugar, and very sparkly.  Then I flattened each cookie with the bottom of a glass and put a nice whole pecan in the middle.  They are absolutely delicious and they look wonderful!  These are now on my list to make every year!  Thanks!!.....12/15/09 an update: My last batch is in the oven so I have time for a quick update.  This year I got 16 DOZEN when I doubled everything!  I think it's because of 2 things: refrigerate the dough over night and use a melon baller to scoop out the portions.  BTW, mine took 10 minutes per batch.",

We tried different \"add ons\" i.e. chocolate chips cinnamon powdered sugar etc. and found that turning this recipe into a Pecan Sandie by adding chopped pecans to the batter leaving the balls whole for baking and rolling in powdered sugar after baking was the best. By leaving these in a ball the cookie was thicker and more cake like so it would just be your own personal preference to do this.",
