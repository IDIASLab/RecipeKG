First bite into his salad and his eyes lit up and before he could swallow he stuck his thumb up. With this kind of instant reaction I couldn't help but try it. Still not a fan of blue cheese but this is pretty darn good. It's definitely not your standard blue cheese dressing but the smooth texture tartness from all the vinegar and the sharpness of the steak sauce (I used A-1) made it very tasty even to me. 10 stars from the hubs and 5 stars from the blue cheese hating me equals a definite winner.
