To speed this process up and eliminate the need for overnight refrigeration assemble the ingredients in reverse order and heat up the honey! Honey and lemon first. Microwave on high until honey/lemon is hot and very fluid. Then add mustard and mix. (I reversed the quantities. I like Dijon better, a personal thing) Then mayo and mix well. The residual heat from the honey ends with a slightly warm sauce, but without a 12 hour delay.",

There is another recipe on AR for this sauce that I\u2019ve tried and loved but I was in the mood to experiment with something different.  Right off the bat I knew this one would be too sweet for our tastes so I reduced the honey by nearly half.  Still, Hubs found it a little sweet, tho\u2019 I was fine with it.   My problem was that I found this a little heavy on the yellow mustard.  Not a bad sauce, but it would be much improved by reducing both the honey and the yellow mustard. Start out with small amounts of each. You can always add more, but you can\u2019t take it out!",

So we hopped on AR for a quick simple recipe and this was just what we needed. I had almost \u00bd c. of mayo left in a qt jar so I added what we needed to make it and had Austin add the rest of the ingredients to the jar. Then he shook it for all he was worth for about 2 min. maybe 3. This was his review of your sauce JILLENA. Awesome!! Better then Mc D\u2019s.

I don't like to modify recipes the first time that I try them, but I don't keep Dijon on hand and wanted honey mustard with the chicken fingers I was making for dinner.  It was good when first made, but I agree with the observation that it improves overnight, so I would recommend that if you want the best flavor, make this a day ahead.
