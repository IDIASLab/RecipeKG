Then it struck me that there is no salt in this recipe.  I would definitely make this again, but before adding all the wonderful flavors I'd sprinkle some kosher salt on the bird.  Since we don't eat the skin, I'd also recommend putting at least half of the seasoning under the skin with the butter.  You want to leave the skin on because it helps keep the meat moist, and moist it definitely is!  Thanks for this recipe!  NOTE:  This was even better as leftovers!  The flavors had had a chance to permeate the moist meat!",

As for the gravy I preferred to use chicken broth rather than water and bouillon. All and all given all the spices and wine the fact this was just average was disappointing.",

We used actual garlic and onions instead of powders and took the advice of prior reviewers and added salt--we used coarse sea salt. Also did not have dry white wine so used white cooking wine which was fine. The outcome was a juicy turkey with plenty of juice to make a yummy gravy. We had put in lots of extra onion and celery to roast with the turkey which is now cooking on the stove with the carcass for soup. We will definitely go back to this recipe I saved it in my recipe box!",

I salted the cavity, added some salt to the spice blend, and also put some of the spices underneath the skin along with the pats of butter.  My 6 lb bird was done in 2-1/4 hours, perfectly moist, tender, and loaded with flavor.  That spice blend really works, and it made delicious gravy, as well.  This now is my go-to recipe for baking a turkey breast.  This is a 5-star recipe with the few tweaks that were made.",
