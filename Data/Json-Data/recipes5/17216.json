The trick is to let it \"set up\" before you use the cookie dough (that is why some people have greasy cookies etc).  Butter has different qualities when it is hot and cold.  If you like crispy cookies refrigerate this dough then bake for a slighly longer time.  For softer cookies mix dough then let it harden up at room temp. Bake only until edges are set.  Finally measure brown sugar accurately--a little over and you will have FLAT cookies! Hope this helps! Thanks Allison for sharing:)",

I am a culinary student in Baltimore, MD, and I am always looking for new recipes. I am a baking major, so I am especially fond of cookies, pies, cakes, etc. \r\nBut these cookies!!! The end batter is very uniform and not at all sticky. You can easily handle the batter with your bare hands for shaping or whatever. The end baked result is an even textured slightly 'butterscotch' flavored cookie with just the right ammount of sweetness and chewiness. The butterscotch flavor is in no way overpowering. It is just back in the background of the layers of flavor in this delectable cookie. Overall, 5 stars and a great end result. Well worth the time.",

Most of my friends & I like the super soft type of chocolate chip cookies but these cookies came out like floury scones instead of cookies that cooked up like little cakes instead of cookies with a high vertical measurement. Also I could taste the 1 teaspoon of baking soda throughout the batch. The batter looked so good I was hopeful but I think a mix of butter & oil or butter & sourcream creates a better cookie softness. 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda is all that's needed not a full teaspoon since it was too much. Vanilla extract would have helped take away some of the floury taste too but that was missing from the recipe. If you love scones however you may like this recipe.",

My 2 favorite ingredients in chocolate chip cookie dough (other than the chocolate) are the brown sugar and the butter (hate shortening) so looking at the recipe I knew I had to try it. I added 1 tbsp vanilla and about 1/2 tsp salt used bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semisweet no other changes. I thought the bittersweet chocolate went well with the brown sugar dough by complementing its sweetness. The one I used was Ghirardelli Double Chocolate chips. Thanks for the great recipe!",
