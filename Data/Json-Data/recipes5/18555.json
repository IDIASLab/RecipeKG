I have brought it to many social events and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews, looks very pretty and many requests for a copy.    My \"tweeks\" include:  Spread the cashews on a foil lined cookie sheet and bake @ 350 degree for 10-15 minutes until lightly toasted/browned.  Saves time, uneveness and greater chance of burning when cooking on stove.  I cut back the olive oil to 1/3 cup (use very high quality olive oil) and maple bacon.  I use a whole pear sliced then cut each slice into halves or thirds, depending on how large the pear is, and toss.  For a more formal presentation, toss the greens with the vinagrette, place on a decorative plate, then sprinkle with the bacon, grapes & pears, leaving pears in slices vs cutting in pieces and fan out in a circular pattern.  Use a firm pear and make sure to wait until the very end to add the pears to prevent browning.  If desired, blue cheese, roquefort or gorgonzola sprinkles can also be added.  YUM!!",

For the dressing we put in 3 tbls toasted sesame seeds and 1 teasp. minced garlic. It also suggests you use peanut oil if you have it in place of the olive or veg. oil. With these extra ingrediants I give this recipe a 5 or in my rating system a 10. Second note: Try including Arugula (rocket) in your salad mix. It has a great nutty flavor when it is picked young and will really compliment the flavors in the rest of the salad.",
