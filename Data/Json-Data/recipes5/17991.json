You may want to chop your bananas & cucumber smaller to make this more like a salsa I just brushed my shrimp with the dressing and ate it all like salad. Thanks for the recipe!",

Didn't have any fish sauce so I used soy instead-- worked great! Also subbed the red pepper with red pepper flakes as it's what I had on hand. And finally subbed with queen-sized shrip instead of king prawns. One thing I wasn't sure about was whether the dish should be served warm or cold. Guess I'll have to taste test both! I will definitely make this interesting dish again. (Gave it a 4 since I didn't follow the exact directions.)",
