I do like to salt the cucumbers for about an hour beforehand - pour a bunch of salt on your pile of sliced cukes sitting in a colander over a bowl or sink. (Like...a bunch of salt. You're rinsing it off anyway so don't be shy.) Let them chill out for an hour then rinse all that salt off and dry with a paper towel before moving on. Keeps things from getting watery once it sits for a bit. And you don't want to water down that dressing - really I could just make that and skip the cukes and eat it with a spoon instead. Anyway I don't always have tamarind around so will substitute lime juice in a pinch. (Although tamarind is delicious - it's what gives Worcestershire sauce that little extra sumpin' sumpin'.) Scallions don't hurt either but you can survive without them. The sesame oil is non-negotiable though - it doesn't seem like much but trust me you want it in there.",

Great for normal cucumbers but is offputting when combined with this sauce. I think it would be better to leave the juices and eat the dish quickly.
