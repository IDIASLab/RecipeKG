This at least will give you a good basic pancake recipe. From here add or omit the cinnamon apples etc. Didn't do the glaze but a brown sugar glaze sounds intriguing.",

I halved everything in the recipe to feed fewer I thought they turned out great but I had to add a little more milk to thin them out since I like thinner pancakes. I'm not sure why so many people feel they need to modify this recipe... I think you should take them at face value. With whole wheat flour and no sugar this recipe will only appeal to a few people. Our family was one. Everyone devoured them! I didn't make the brown sugar glaze but if I did I sure wouldn't want sugar in the cakes PLUS this glaze on top.",
