The rosemary flavor is unusual and special; the brown sugar and cayenne adds enough heat/sweet to perk your palate and make you do a double-take. (What spiced nuts are these?!) The salt adds a tiny bit of crispy crunch. And I used salted butter. I was introduced to these cashews when visiting my brother, who'd received them as a Christmas treat. When I was gifted a big tin of cashews the following Christmas, I decided to make them myself. Make sure you watch the oven carefully -- depending on the heat of your oven (ours runs hot) and the size of the cashews, they may cook a little quicker than expected, and as with all nuts, you will taste a burned flavor if they're even a little overdone. I'm not speaking from experience at all. ;-) These would be delicious made with almonds, too.",
