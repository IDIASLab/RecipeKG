Came across this recipe and poured a swirl of extra virgin olive oil in the skillet and added about half a tablespoon of butter and, then, the green beans.  Stirred until coated and added similar seasonings (I used an all purpose seasoning sold by U.S. Wellness Meats, that is made in St Louis.) Turned to coat the green beans and periodically turned again in the skillet.  I didn't time it, but, checked with a fork until done to my liking.  They were great this way!  Will make again!",

They were delicious! I followed the recipe pretty closely adding fresh garlic cause I have tons of it! And adding butter with the olive oil like someone else suggested. Yum!\nFirst I warmed the skillet with olive oil and butter. While that was heating I cut the tips/end of each green bean(GB) then cut them in half and cleaned them. \nSecond I threw the thinly sliced garlic in the pan then the GBs then the seasonings. Covered and stirred every 10 min until our desired firmness. Per my hubby \"2 thumbs up and definitely make again!\" :)\nOk so maybe I had more to say than just \"wow\"",
