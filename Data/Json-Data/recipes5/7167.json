I ate a similar version at a friend's house who recreated it after eating it at a Syrian family's house and then made my own version at home. I usually roast the eggplant the day before or in the morning and then I can make the dish quickly when it's time to eat. I usually serve it with bread. It keeps well in the fridge as well for a yummy lunch the next day.",
