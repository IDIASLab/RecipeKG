I used a 15 oz.container of Sorrento ricotta instead of the cottage cheese. Slowly melted cream cheese in onion mix,then added ricotta and rest of things until heated through. I used fresh shrimp and 1/2 pound scallops that I cut in half. Fried in pan with some butter and garlic until shrimp turned pink. I used Bumble Bee lump crab(more expensive than regular) but it all broke up so I will use regular kind in can next time. I will also add more scallops. To sauce mix, we use skim milk, so I added 1/3c half n half and also added 3 T fresh grated parmesan cheese. Didn't use the wine. I used mozzarella instead of cheddar and used between layers and on topping with parmesan. I let stand 10 min. after taking out of oven before serving and it held up great, it wasn't runny at all. Very good! Thanks Rayna!",

Also, I thought chedder might be too sharp, so I used a mixute of shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheeses (you can buy the mixture in a bag).  They melted perfectly over the top!  It turned out absolutely fabulous!!!  I fact, I have been asked to make it every night (and I just may)!!",

My lasagna was neither too salty or too liquidy it was perfect. Added a little mozzerella on top in addition to the other cheeses and used 1 lb of Maryland jumbo lump crab meat no substitutes and 1/2 lb of scallops. Perfect!!!!",

Made a few changes: used medium shrimp coarsely chopped ( pat dry between paper towels) ricotta instead of cottage cheese and no boil lasagna noodles. It is easy to spread the cream cheese mixture onto the no boil noodles (4 per layer). I topped the last layer of seafood mixture with a layer of noodles covered the noodles with mozarella and parmesan cheese. Sprinkled a tiny bit offinely minced fresh basil on top for color. I assembled this in the morning and baked it several hours later. It set up well not soupy at all. This is a keeper! Thanks.",
