Next time I think I'll start teh carrots and add the sweet potatoes after 5 min. I'll also get the applesauce out of the fridge and let it sit while cooking the potato and carrots. Our mash cooled down quite a bit with the addition of the applesauce. But really I do think this is a good recipe. Next time I make it I'm sure I'll give it a \"5 star\". I think it could use a little something in the spice area but I'm not sure what. If anyone has any thoughts please post them. A little ginger maybe?",

At least I'm hoping so, because I really did enjoy the recipe so much the first time around!  I'll definitely give it another shot...and be careful with the sugar this time!
