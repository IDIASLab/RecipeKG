Make sure you drain the potatoes very well, drop the butter in first, give it a couple of mashes and add the rest of the ingredients.  This will help with the consistency.  Do NOT overmash or they will get sticky.  There should be a few small chunks of potato in the mix when you are done.  I know a lot of people do not like raw garlic (I do!), as other reviewers have noted, you may like it better with roasted garlic.  Do not add the garlic to the boiling potato water, or you'll end up with almost no garlic flavor at the end.  When scaling the recipe, use the \"scale recipe\" feature on the recipe page to reduce the chance of any math errors.  IF you decide to reduce the butter and add milk... the milk MUST be added after you mash in the butter, or the butter will not bind properly with the starch in the potatoes and you'll end up with a weird consistency.",

But I'm adding my 2 cents anyhow: Very good - VERY garlicky. \r\nI, too, scaled it down for 10 people. Red potatoes boil up very nicely and make it easy to use your blender on them once they're done. I very much liked the strong garlic taste - but a few of my guests did not.  However, one did ask for the recipe, and that rarely happens. I did not use quite so much butter as the recipe wanted - I used 2 sticks for the 5 lb of potatoes. After all was said and done, it was more like creamed potatoes than mashed. But I liked it a lot. \r\nMy suggestion on the garlic: next time I make these, I plan on blanching (boiling) the garlic.  This, too, will cut down on the rawness of it without killing the flavor. I would suggest putting in the garlic with the boiling potatoes during the last 10 min of boling as this would both flavor the potatoes and tone down the garlic as well.",

I made one serving and just eyeballed the amounts of ingredients to my preference.  I used russett potatoes, parmesan, margarine, and milk.  I boiled the garlic along with the potatoes, which resulted in a loss of all garlic flavour.  Next time I will try oven roasting the garlic, instead.  This was an enjoyable recipe and a nice change from the norm.\n\nETA:  The pungent carmelized flavour of oven roasted garlic was fantastic!  I peeled the cloves of garlic and placed them in the centre of a doubled piece of aluminum foil.  I drizzled extra virgin olive oil over the garlic and closed the foil, leaving a small vent for steam to escape at the top.  I placed this onto a pie plate and then into the oven to roast alongside my meatloaf at 375F for approximately 45 minutes.",

Instead of chopped garlic, I simply roasted a bulb of garlic in the oven, mashed it and added it right in. That way the garlic was more mellow and not overpowering.  I was a bit nervous that the recipe didn't call for milk, but DON'T WORRY... the butter will make up for it!  I added a bit too much (16oz - 4 sticks) and they still came out PERFECT!  I used fresh grated romano cheese that I bought at the store in a little tub in the cheese section.  Even those who don't like skin-on potatoes raved about them! Virtually foolproof and exquisite!",

If you are scaling this recipe down to 10 servings I recommend boiling for only 35-40 minutes.  Enjoy... (It's very good!)",
