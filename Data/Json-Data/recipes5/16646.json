I also used a cookie scoop which made tablespoon-sized scoops but smaller would have been better so next time I will use a teaspoon as the recipe states.",

However, and I'm not sure if it's because of being high-altitude/low humidity or what, but when I tried to mix the sugar mixture in, it looked incredibly too dry.  I ended up beating another egg white and adding it in - that seemed to get it at least to the point where it looked workable.  Even then, some of the batter ended up so crumbly I had to discard it.  Everything tasted wonderful, and the cookies had an excellent consistency!\n\nUpdate: did this recipe again, toasted the pecans first, used two egg whites again, and it came out beautifully...the pre-toasted pecans really make it pop.",
