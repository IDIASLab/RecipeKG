The difference is that instead of the lemon juice and the pineapple juice Gramma put in 1 cup of sugar with a bag of fresh cranberries and a box of any red colored jello. She boiled this mixture until the berries popped open. Then She mixed this together with a large can of crushed pineapple. Finally she added the chopped celery apple and nuts and put the mixture in the fridge to chill for several hours. I've tried to adjust the ingredients when cranberries weren't available but nothing compares to the original.",
