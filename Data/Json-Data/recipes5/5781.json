I swapped minced garlic for the minced onion but to still get a little of the onion flavor swapped onion powder for the garlic powder. Used garlic pepper blend in placed of the black pepper. The first time I made this it was just enough for 5 palm-sized pieces of backstrap - perfect. I doubled it the next time for 1.5 lbs of leg steaks - enough steak to comfortably fill a quart-zize zip bag and I found that I probably didn't need to do so. I don't think you need to increase the marinade if you're using a baggie but definitely would if marinating in a bowl or similar container.",
