I skewered the meat separate from the peppers, onions, and cherry tomatoes as they cook at different rates.  The meat was very tender and full of flavor - perfect with a side of rice.",

I only had about 4 hours to marinade but it turned out amazing. I can only imagine what a steak would taste like after 24 hours in this stuff. I wouldn't change a thing! I made a double batch and not only marinated the steak but also the shrimp, mushrooms, carrotts, and zucchini. I used a seperate bag for the veggies. Also, used a low sodium soy sauce and used as much as the recipe called for and it was excellent, not too salty at all. I would give it more stars if I could!",
