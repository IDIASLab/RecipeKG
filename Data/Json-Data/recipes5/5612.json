I had to substitute the cumin and parsley. Instead I used savory and chili powder. Also I had to make my own tahini with the following recipe: 1 1/3 cup sesame seeds 1/8 - 1/4 cup oil I baked the sesame seeds on a shallow pan at 350'F shaking the tray every minute or so for about 8-10 minutes. Let the seeds cool and pureed them with the oil. As a twist I put the hummus on a tortilla wrap with chopped carrots. Delicious every way you serve it.",
