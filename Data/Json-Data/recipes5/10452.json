I asked her to teach me how to make it about five years ago and have been making my homemade herb salt since then. We always add onion and garlic. I love the flavor. Also the onion helps blend the herbs together since I use a regular blender. My grandma adds marjoram to hers but I can never find fresh marjoram when I need it. Since I love basil I use it instead. I never tried to season cooked food at the table with this and I don't see it working (maybe it is because I add onion and garlic?) but I use my herb salt to season pretty much anything I am cooking. Try it on your rice. You won't believe how much better they will taste.",
