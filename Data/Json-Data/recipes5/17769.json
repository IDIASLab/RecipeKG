I made a few changes based upon previous reviews:  Used only 3 bunches of green onions instead of 4.  Added a medium yellow onion cut into wedges.  Added 4 cloves of minced garlic and approximately 1\" of fresh grated ginger root to the marinade.  Used 2 tablespoon of Aleppo pepper instead of the crushed red pepper and whole dried red chile peppers.  I found that the Aleppo adds a nice bite to the dish without being too hot (I'm a whimp when it comes to hot food).  I did not think the soy sauce was too overpowering and there was plenty of salt.  With the above changes it makes this dish great!  Good luck!  \r\n\r\nUpdate: You may substitute vanilla extract for the sherry.  I tried this and it tasted the same.",

This surpassed it.  I added a tablespoon of hoisin sauce and 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the marinade/sauce.  I also reduced the cornstarch to 1 tablespoon.  I stir fried the green onions along with some thinly sliced yellow onion and green bell pepper because that's how King's Garden does it.  I also didn't use quite as much oil as called for, and everything came out terrific.  My daughter claimed it was much better than the restaurant's!  Thanks, Kimber!",

I disagree with the two previous posts- this is \"eat it 2 times a week yummy!\" Doubling the sauce is not a bad idea if you like more sauce. I just kept it covered while cooking so the sauce didn't cook down. I added some sweet onions along with the green onions- just me preference. This is my new favorite recipe.",
