I have to admit though I subbed olive oil because we don't have grapeseed oil and I only used half the amount. I think using a half cup of oil would have actually made it way too oily. It wasn't until later that I realized I left out the carrots too but it was still excellent without. I decreased poppy seeds to 2 teaspoons instead of tablespoons and think that was just enough too. A thought on the apples - if you don't plan to serve the salad immediately and put the dressing on the salad right away you might want to shake them with some lemon juice ahead of time to keep them from turning brown.",
