I have been baking for years and have not seen such a flat cookie recipe in about as many. They were hard to remove from my well greased sheet even after I let them sit on the sheet for a few minutes to cool off. They are crumbly and not a very solid cookie at all. On a positive note they are a very tasty cookie. I won't be making these again. sorry just not happy at all with these.",
