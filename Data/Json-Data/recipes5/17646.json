My husband doesn't like Honey ham at all so I was afraid that he would think this too sweet. So I started with a 1/2 c. packed brown sugar...then whisked in another 1/8 c. un-packed until the taste was spicy with just enough sweetness. I then cut (not scored but actually cut slices into the ham steak) and put a few tsps of the marinade into a ziploc bag and marinated the ham for an hour while reserving the rest. We don't have an outdoor/indoor grill because we live in an apt and have an electric stove....so I put this on a cookies sheet and broiled it while basting it a few times. I served the remaining marinade on the side for dipping....but I found simply pouring a little over top after cooking tasted the same. For myself I sprinkled on a little red pepper flakes (but that's a new craving for me so I eat it on everything) I tasted my husband's without it and it was DIVINE!! I served with steamed corn. We will definitely have this again. It was AWESOME!!!",
