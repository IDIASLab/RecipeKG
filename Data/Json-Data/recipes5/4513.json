When I pulled out ingredients for my dinner I noticed I was short of fish sauce. Since both my intended recipes used it I had to portion what I had left. I used about a tablespoon for this. After simmering sauce I dumped it in the blender and used half and half instead of cream. This was just fantastic! Every bite was a symphony on the tongue each element is available and noticeable yet blends together to a fantastic result. This recipe would be well suited to anyone that doesn't really care for the taste of fish as the other flavors really explode and hide any fish flavor.",
