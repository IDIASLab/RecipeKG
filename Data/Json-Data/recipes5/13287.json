I think they most likely meant for the recipe to call for 5 pounds total, not 3x five pound bags which would mean 15lbs of meatballs in total. (Mama Mia!) I did mine with about 3.5 pounds of meatballs and still had a couple extra cups of sauce. I'm sure you would be able to do this with up to 5lbs but not much more than that without adding more jelly/chili sauce.",

I think the written recipe shows the wrong amount.  Anyway, even though the ingredients gave me some trepidation, this meal was the hit of the party, and the first to go!

One suggestion with the prepared frozen meatballs is to cook them in an oven on a broiling pan, to get rid of the fat that would otherwise be in with the sauce (it's surprising how much there is!!!). I assemble everything the night before, throw the crock in the fridge, and turn it on the next day to heat through - also great to serve with hot dog buns - the sandwiches are delish!",

I used a 18oz jar of Grape jelly, one 12oz jar of chili sauce and one bag of meatballs more then enough for us two.  I thought it needed more flavor so I  added a can of chili. The chili gave it a little more taste and it worked out great. I added the chili at the last half hour of cooking.",

When making the sauce be sure to whisk it until there are no lumps of jelly to prevent pockets of overly-sweet flavor.  I made way too much, but these reheat so well that the large batch was totally gone in three days!  I do think the portion is incorrect as was noted in another review, and I used pre-made meatballs from my local grocery store.  I have made meatballs before, but these are the first to stay very moist, even when reheated!  This is a keeper!!",
