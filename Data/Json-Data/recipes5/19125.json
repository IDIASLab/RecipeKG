My kids will tolerate the store bought organic, but they LOVED this. It's just like eating the inside of an apple pie. I upped the quantity of the pumpkin pie spice to a full tsp. and I also added the spice and the brown sugar to the crockpot during the cooking process. Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing.\n\nEDITED 06/17/08: I made this today\nwith half pear and half apples. This \nis a great way to use your excess crops\nor fruit that just didn't get eaten \nfast enough. My kids just can't get enough of this sauce!",

Go to AllRecipes! This applesauce was incredible. I used all the different apples in the pantry (I had 11 of them!) including Gala, Fuji, Grannysmith and Honeycrisp. Threw 'em in the 6 qt. slowcooker on low with a cup of water...they were done enough for me at 5 hours. I added a cup of raisins (o glorious plump and juicy raisin, how I worship thee!), a half-cup of brown sugar (the apples would have been fine without it, but I was jonesin' for some sweetness), threw in 1 teaspoon of cinammon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a pinch of allspice, mace and cardamom...and the house smells wonderful. 1/2 hour later I was eating applesauce for dinner! \nBig sloppy kisses to ASG for this wunnerful recipe, that was perfect for my sore lil mouth after surgery, but I will be making again when I feed the firemen next month, and have potlucks in the future. Otherwise, I know me...I will make this pile of yumminess and eat it all myself! I can just imagine what this would be like over vanilla ice cream....sigh.",
