I greatly reduced the portion for just me and for convenience used baby kale greens I find them to be tender and sweet and because they were baby greens I did not have to massage the dressing into the leaves or wait an hour to eat. For anyone who doesn't know what liquid amino acid taste like it taste like soy sauce. I grow my own sprouts so this salad was an ideal way to enjoy them! The dressing is great and what makes the salad. I added sundried tomatoes because I like them. Nice recipe hawkeye154. Thanks for sharing.",

Now that I've moved I have wished to make it myself and savor those days at the deli waiting my turn to order this salad. I've made it several times and I'm giving it a 4 star rating is because I can't seem find a good balance using equal amounts of ingredients for the dressing without it being too salty. I believe it is best to start with less Amino Acids and adjust to taste. I also like Meyers lemons for their slightly sweeter lemon flavor. This is the only two adjustments I make. ENJOY!",
