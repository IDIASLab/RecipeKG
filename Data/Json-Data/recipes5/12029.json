I figured that ahead of time (thank goodness).  I ended up making it in a 2q round casserole dish.  Fit perfectly.  Also, I had no idea how to use phyllo dough.  My bad... but all in all, I used the amount stated for each layer and still had more than half a package left.  Other than those concerns, no problems with recipe.  I did tweek it a little.  I added garlic to the spinach, mushroom, onion saute.  (used baby portabellos).  Then I added about 1/4 cup of Parmesan to the cheese filling.  I added a dash or two of garlic powder to the butter when I melted it.  This was a heavenly dish.  Husband raved and had two helpings, which he never does.  Thanks so much for the recipe.",
