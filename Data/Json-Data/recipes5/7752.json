This recipe uses an immersion blender, but don't worry if you don't have one--I've included instructions to make it without it in the note section of this recipe.

Then slowly pour in the oil through the holes in the top with the processor running. Nothing will happen at first, then all of a sudden it will emulsify and get all creamy and thick. Voila, Mayonnaise! The first time I did it I didn't wait long enough for it to emulsify, I thought it was a failure, but after that I realized nothing was going to happen until most of the oil was added. I can't quite imagine using an immersion blender, you need one hand for the blender and the other to pour in the oil slowly, I'd want another hand to hold the jar just in case. Unfortunately, I only have two.",

This affected the texture, I really couldn't blend it long enough to get it to properly thicken.  We'll be investing in an immersion blender, for sure.  Also, it had a strong olive oil taste, with not enough of that \"mayo tang\"  I will probably use a bit more canola & a bit less olive oil & use a stronger blend of vinegar, lemon & mustard powder.  It was good enough to give it another try, with the tweaks.   May just be a personal preference thing.",
