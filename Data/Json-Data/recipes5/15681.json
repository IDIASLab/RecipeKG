The concept is creative and the potential for improvement is there, but the execution is completely wrong, IMHO. Combining the tater tots with everything else was where this went downhill. The tots were mushy and barely noticeable. I suggest layering the tots on TOP of the meat / corn / bean mixture. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over all, cover with cheese and bake as directed. I also do not think it's necessary to use frozen corn (I used canned Fiesta corn but PictSweet brand sells a frozen Southwest blend that would also work and eliminate the need for a separate can of beans). Since beans are only sold in 15 oz. cans at my local grocery store, I added a *tad* more than called for. My final change (per the advice of others) was to add a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies because my hubs and I LOVE spicy food. The usual taco garnishes (i.e. shredded lettuce, tomato, green onion and sour cream) added a little pizzazz to our plates. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Mama Smith. I am looking forward to trying this again - with MY changes! :-)",

I did a couple things differently...I used ground chicken instead of beef (because thats what I had thawed) I also used regular frozen corn because I couldn't find Mexican Style and I didnt put cheese in the dish because my husband doesn't like cheese. I just sprinkled some on top for me! :) This will definitely be made again, and I will thaw beef out next time to try it that way! Thanks for a great recipe!",
