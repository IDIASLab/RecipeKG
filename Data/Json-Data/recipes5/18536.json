The possibilities for condiments seem to be limitless- although these sandwiches need nothing else to be awesome. These are great- so easy and HUGE results! (I used a thick cut ham steak instead of a whole ham because there were only two of us for dinner last night.) We're having a birthday party here next weekend and I'm going to make a big pot of these for our guest- this recipe is TOO GOOD to keep to ourselves!  Thank you so much for sharing this! UPDATE 1/15/07 I used this recipe 3 times over the holidays for my 'holiday ham' and it was a SMASHING SUCCESS!!!!!!  I don't think I'll ever do ham any other way ever again!  We even had a repair man here one night who wanted to stay for dinner because it smelled so good!",

I bought those trays of rolls that are in a metal pan I placed the ham in all of the rolls placed the rolls back on the pan tied the plastic cover back up and placed them in the fridge. The kids just help themselves sometimes eating them cold sometimes heating them up in the microwave for 15 seconds. They don't care for a bunch of condiments so this recipe works out great!
