This was perfect as a nest for Texas Beer Boiled Shrimp. I used angel hair pasta and cut the water back to just 1 tbs which I added to 1 tbs lemon and lime juice and 1 tbs EVOO for 2 servings. Cilantro isn't a favorite so I used basil instead and reduced the sage to a rounded tsp. The possibilities are endless. Thank you Ryan this is a keeper!",

The seasonings mimicked those in my seafood so I thought it'd be a nice accompaniment. I did change it a bit though. I omitted the water completely and used about 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead. I used about 1 teaspoon of sage half a tablespoon of parsley half a teaspoon of white pepper and a teaspoon of sea salt. It was a refreshing change from the norm and the flavors did go really well with our fish. Definitely something I'll make again.",
