I cooked the onions in with the beef and etc instead of sprinkling them with the cheese...definitely used more salsa (I used HOT salsa so good!), and I baked it for half an hour at 350 and then put the cheese on and baked for another ten minutes. I think just half an hour would have sufficed though; the shells were a little bit over cooked. Didn't stop me from eating them though. I want to make more of these right away. Thank you Jennifer!  EDIT: I made these a second time recently.  The first time I used regular canned beans, as compared to the refried beans, because I couldn't find the refriend.  I made them with the refried this time and I think I like with the beans better.  And a tip for vegetarians: Omit the ground beef and use the refriend beans WITH canned red beans, or whatever your preference.  =0)",
