Olive oil drizzled over. Bake in hot oven--550 til liquid is boiling, then reduce heat and bake 20 minutes. 5 minutes before serving, drizzle one tablespoon of whipping cream over fish (only if creme fraiche is not in house.)\n\nMost importantly, Marie says \"if the fish is good, the dish is good.\"",

The only changes I made to the recipe were that I added a sprinkle of salt to each fillet and in addition to parchment paper I wrapped a second layer of tinfoil around the first packet to make sure if the parchment didn't open up. 15 minutes was long enough for me unlike some of the others however I did use small fillets. I served with hollaindaise sauce. Will be making this again.",
