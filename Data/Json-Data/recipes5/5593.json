I felt the garlic went well with the cranberry sauce. I had a little trouble getting the cranberry sauce to melt all the way next time I might try melting it in the microwave before adding it to the skillet or I might try a can of whole berry cranberry sauce. I cooked this quite a bit longer than the recipe calls for but one of my guilty secrets is that I really like my broccoli mushy. I know not the healthiest way to eat it but IMO the tastiest. A side note to those of you needing to use up cranberry sauce it goes really well with curry too.",
