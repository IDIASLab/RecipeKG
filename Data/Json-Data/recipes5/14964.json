UPDATE 5/12: I made them again with little changes: used minced garlic and put it in the oven for 30 minutes with the oil. used 1/4 of heavy cream instead of milk. again no water. and I add sheddar cheese...Oh my goodness! delicious!!! better than the first time Definitely a keeper!!!",

I mash the white potatoes with the milk/butter a little sour cream - separately. I rough mash S/P's with 1 T finely minced FRESH rosemary (I don't recommend dried) and fresh Asiago cheese (didn't have parm) and add it all 'in' the potatoes. Salt & pepper both kinds of potatoes and don't use any 'potato' water - why use that? THEN - I gently fold the two types together. I make ahead so these do get baked but covered. I think it looks rather unique since it's kinda two toned and everyone thinks they're delish. Have made several times but go a bit less on the S/P portion to white potato. I prefer white pepper in this vs black. I add fresh ground coriander nutmeg & couple shakes of ground cayenne in the S potato mix. Nice idea & something easily modified for personal pref thanks!",
