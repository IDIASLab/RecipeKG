        "description": "I have never used raw kale for anything except juicing, so I was really pleased that my first attempt at making a salad with it was a success. Even though I see variations of this recipe on menus all the time, I was not sure how it would work for me in a salad, so I was a bit intimidated.  Browsing through the internet I found an article on massaging kale and I decided to give it a try. This is an absolute MUST if you do not want to feel like you are eating plastic. It was so good, I will have to make it again and try it out on my finicky family.",
