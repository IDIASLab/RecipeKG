I added walnuts (though macadamia nuts would have been good too) and a little bit of coconut shavings for texture and flavor. I also mixed half regular rum and half coconut rum as to offset the actual coconut shavings and not overpower the dish. I got the flambe to work though it didn't last very long. It depends on the strength of the alcohol you're using. I continued heating it after the flambe to cook off the rest of the liquid and it worked out well. It was very good served over brown rice!",

Made the recipe to order once and I think that I got a buzz just readying the recipe. Flambeed it and it burned for no less than 5 minutes and it still was too rum-my. I will try to cut the sugar/butter/rum next time and base it more off of awesome Banana's Foster II recipe. The banana's will be cut chunkier and nuts should be added too to create some texture other than mush and chicken. 1/4 cup butter 2/3 cup dark brown sugar 3 1/2 tablespoons rum 1 1/2 teaspoons amaretto 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3 bananas peeled and sliced lengthwise and crosswise 1/4 cup coarsely chopped walnuts",

The bananas become kinda mushy and the dish is sweet so if you're not into that avoid it. I was worried about the rum because well bad mornings after rum have left me disliking it...but the flambe really took care of the alcohol taste. TO FLAMBE THE ALCOHOL: get the pan and ingredients nice and hot add the alcohol let it bubble on the sides of the pan ignite the alcohol fumes just above the liquid. Step back! The flames really shoot up! Take the pan off the burner and serve when the flames go out.",
