I added a can of chick peas as well as the black beans and I had to add more taco seasoning liquid and salt because of that. I mixed it all together rather than putting the beans/pineapple on top so that it was easy to divide up and refrigerate for later. Good for lunch with a piece of fruit on the side.",
