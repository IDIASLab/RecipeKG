Beat the appropriate amount of water with the egg replacer to make four eggs and added that when the yolks were called for. Rolled them into balls probably twice as big as suggested to make large cookies and then rather than dip them in egg whites rolled them in brown sugar instead. He made bigger thumbprints and he used APPLE JELLY to fill them and sprinkled them with SKOR TOFFEE BITS BEFORE putting them in the oven. Took 15 minutes because they're larger. These turned out to be reallllyy incredible cookies! Now me home on a sick day from work am keeping myself cheery by making these Angus-tweaked Thumb-print Cookies.",
