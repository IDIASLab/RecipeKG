Redid another batch w/ half the soy sauce and doubled the (coconut for mayo) mixed both batches (too salty one) w/ remade one... awesome!  I used it as a topping to rice w. veggies AND as a dipping sauce w/ raw veggies.  I loved this and will be doing it again. It was so easy to make.  The longer its refrigerated the better",
