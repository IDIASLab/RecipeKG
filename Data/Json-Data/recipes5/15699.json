                "reviewBody": "This is actually extremely delicious and well worth the effort.  The issues are first, never use lettuce in layered dips because the lettuce wilts and makes the dip unpleasant.  Next, mix the taco seasoning in with the beans instead of the sour cream and cream cheese.  The reason is if the salsa and jalapenos are spicy then the sour cream with cream cheese mixture is the perfect opposite and adding the taco seasoning takes away from the slightly sour taste.  If using chips or pork rinds, slice the tomatoes in thirds otherwise they will be too heavy.  If eating this as a salad of sorts then leave the tomatoes in halves.  I used yellow cherry tomatoes which was the perfect compliment to the sweet red onion and the heat.  You can use whipped cream cheese at room temperature or heat it in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Stirring with a spoon works just as good as a mixer.  Very tasty!",
