I really liked that this had carrots, apple, pumpkin & PB. I used two small shredded apples instead of applesauce as that's what I had on hand. I eyeballed most of the measurements, and they still turned out great. Just add flour til it gets to the proper dough consistency.  I also just rolled and flattened teaspoon-sized bits of dough in my hand rather than rolling & cutting with cookie cutters, just for ease. They make a really nice softer cookie that my older pups appreciate! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!",

I added a teaspoon of vanilla and mostly omitted the water as the dough was wet enough.   I did the whole recipe in the food processor starting with grating the carrots.  I used small Christmas cookie cutters to make them more festive.  These are not \"hard\" dog biscuits, more like a cookie.  They will mold, so keep them in the freezer.  The dogs love them frozen!",
