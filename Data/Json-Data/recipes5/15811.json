For the meat mixture closely followed the recipe other than omitting the olive oil and using Taco Seasoning I from this site rather than store bought. Elected to use the HERDEZ Mexican Cornbread recipe from this site since the Krusteaz Honey Corn Bread Mix suggested by the recipe submitter was not available at local grocery stores and we prefer cornbread made from scratch. However if the Krusteaz brand is locally available it s probably a good choice as there are 20 reviews on Amazon.com as of this date and all are 5 rated. The HERDEZ cornbread perfectly complimented the meat mixture. When making this again I would only use 1/2 - 2/3 of the HERDEZ cornbread mixture for this pie as the full amount makes a top layer of cornbread that is somewhat thick relative to the meat mixture. The remaining cornbread batter would be baked in a separate dish alongside the tamale casserole dish and then frozen for future use. After 20 years of tinkering with this recipe bcummings221 it s time for you take a victory lap as it s as close to perfect as it can practically get... thank you for sharing!",

Having lived in Arizona for the last 6 years, what a culture shock THAT will be  !!!\n\nSo, I looked at my poor dwindled cupboards & said hmmm, I wonder what I can scrounge up.  Small amount of taco seasoning - A/R recipe, salsa & canned chillies, corn, olives, corn meal, pkg. bread sticks, can of tuna, some grated Cheddar, spices, an onion, and a few others that said \"childhood favorite - Tamale Pie!!!  A/R recipe says \"Sweet Tamale pie\" & I was in business!!!  \n\nSO, here I sit, replete, (I can't believe I ate the whole thing!), having enjoyed the INCREDIBLE dinner this was!!  The recipe didn't call for olives, like my Mother used to do, & since they weren't on the recipe, I didn't add them in.  Next time I will, but when I intend to review a recipe, I try to be a purist the first go around.  However, if they weren't a \"part of the memory\" addition, I wouldn't bother!  Very few times in my experience, is a recipe exactly like I love it, & totally without need for changes, but THIS one IS!!!\n\nVERY nice work \"bcummings221\"!!!!!!  And, thanks for sharing!",

And my tomato and corn products were not \"Mexican\" flavored just tomatoes and corn. As always in our family I used for the beef: elk venison or extra lean free range beef. I doubled the recipe and froze one (cooked) for later but I didn't entirely double the cornbread portion so the meat to bread ratio was more to our liking.
