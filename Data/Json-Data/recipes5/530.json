A HUGE hit. \nI use 2-4oz cans of roasted chilis in place of the Anaheim, low fat mayo, and I reduce the oil, using \u00bc c olive oil.  I also find I prefer the fuller flavor of grated Parmesan to the traditional Cotija in the dressing (but sprinkle the Cotija on the finished salad. \nThis dressing is also a great dip (I use one cup LF sour cream and \u00bd cup LF mayo), for chips, veggies, on top of roasted potatoes, spread on sandwiches, and swirled into tomato soup.

I used to only buy the bottled El Torito dressing once in a while on a splurge and then use it sparingly ... on fish tacos which is our favorite use of it.  I like making foods from scratch and especially \"copy cat\" recipes.  Maybe I will post my \"copy\" of Chevy's Restaurant (Southern Calif. again) with my own twists.  I also roast the tomatoes and onions on our patio \"chimenea\" with a little  grill place on top like I did for the Anaheim pepper for this dressing recipe.  The dressing already was tasting heavenly even before I put the cilantro it.  It is so much better than the bottled; you can taste the little crunchy pepitas much better.  I cut the recipe in half as we are empty nesters now and it still made a little more than 12 oz. plus what I ate off the spatula!  I used my 4 or 5 cup food processor  for this half recipe and it was perfect.  ( I don't like my blender.)  Oh, I am one happy camper.  Thank YOU!  I wanted to post my photo of the dressing in a large canning jar, but the pixels were too big. :-(",
