It is more pudding like than bread like (which is what I originally expected) and the caramelized sugar made me think the dish was very burnt. Still, anyone who has tried it has raved.\n\nI make it as written for Thanksgiving, but I have tried cutting back the butter and sugar when I make it at other times. This is what I have learned: \nHalf the butter gets you closer to the bread consistency, tastes pretty good, and doesn't ooze butter. On the downside, you can of course taste the missing butter.\nHalf the brown sugar with all the butter tastes like butter. I do not recommend it.\nHalf the butter and half the brown sugar gets you the more bread like consistency and doesn't ooze butter, but is definitely much more bland.",
