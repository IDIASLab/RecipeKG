I love TGI Friday's Chicken Piccata so I was looking for a similar recipe and came across this one and I'm so glad I did! I made a few changes and it was perfect. I read some of the complaints about not enough sauce and the sauce being too lemony so I didn't reduce my wine to half and I didn't quite use 1/4 cup of lemon juice. I also added marinated artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers. I also increased my capers by about a Tbs. (We love capers) and I used dried basil instead of fresh parsley. I also try to make lighter versions of my meals so I omitted the butter used lite chicken broth and I used whole wheat angel hair pasta instead and even with the modifications this recipe did not suffer one bit--as a matter of fact it tasted exactly like TGI Friday's version and my family LOVED it. I definitely will be making this again.",
