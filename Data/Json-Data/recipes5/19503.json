                "reviewBody": "Very tasty recipe. A little temperamental though. Here are some tips to avoid frustration. 1) Your frosting mixture should be at a gentle simmer (or it may burn) so adjust the heat accordingly. I had to use med-low since med-high was bubbling way too furiously. 2) Melt and mix butter cream peanut butter and vanilla first then gradually mix in sugars. 3) Taste test as you add the sugars: I found 1 cup of each type to be plenty sweet so I left out the 2nd cup of confectioners' sugar. 4) Keep gently simmering and stirring constantly (not frequently) until all sugar is dissolved. 5) Spread quickly and use the back of a spoon to pound it out if necessary. As stated in the recipe quick spreading is important. As it cools (quickly) the PB oil makes the frosting not want to stick very well. It just wants to peel right off. Fortunately my brownies were 95% covered by then with only a little unevenness so I took the back of a spoon and pounded it even. It was my first time making this recipe and it came out awesome with the mentioned modifications. I gave it 4 stars because I really didn't change much I just had to take a few unmentioned steps.",
