I sometimes substitute chickpeas for the lentils, but  be aware that they have a slightly stronger flavor. The white wine is used for flavor but can be left out if desired. Reduced-sodium chicken broth can be used. This recipe keeps well in the fridge and can be served warm or cold.",

                "reviewBody": "I know what it's like to have a great recipe to share but no photo so I thought I would give this a try based solely on how it sounded and I am glad I did. This dish is really delicious but there are a couple of changes I suggest. First the amount of time needed to brown the garlic is way too long...it only takes a couple of minutes. Anymore than that and it starts to burn. Second and this is really minor but it makes a difference in how well the mixture blends is that it helps to chop the spinach before adding it to the recipe. That being said I made a couple of changes due to taste and necessity as well. I like corn but by itself and tend to dislike it added to this type of recipe so I eliminated the corn. That was a matter of taste. Second in my area the only lentils available in a can are in lentil soup. The only other lentils here are dried. Since dark lentils take longer to cook and this recipe didn't specify what lentils to use green black orange or red and since orange lentils cook really quickly (and I actually prefer orange and red ones anyway) I used dried orange lentils and mixed them in with the broth. Since they don't plump like other dried beans I still used a cup. Other than those changes I made this as directed and really enjoyed it. The best thing is that it was yummy both warm right after cooking and cold as a light lunch the next day. I wish I had taken a picture to post but I will do this next time if no one else posts one. Good!",

Next time I may try to spice it up a bit more with something like cumin. I used a red onion for extra colour and a diced green onion for more flavour (and colour.) I may leave out the spinach next time and add some other vegetables maybe zucchini or yellow/green beans...anything summery. I did also use some white wine not sure if it added much to the recipe but I enjoyed drinking the leftovers while making the salad:-)",

I also used a cup of frozen baby spinach since I didn t have white wine and I figured that would add the liquid needed. It came out very good.
