Also used 4 Tbsp lemon juice.I never added the last 1 and 1/2 cups chicken broth leaving it thicker and it was delicious. I divided some of the soup and did add some cut-up ham which I served at dinner but will plan on leaving the remainder meatless for a nice light lunch. A little bit of sour cream was lovely but not necessary I can t rave enough about this recipe. It reminds me of a pea soup I had years ago served in a fine restaurant. Perfect for the summer and tastes garden-fresh. Thank you so much!",
