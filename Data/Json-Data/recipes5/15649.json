I used mild store-bought picante sauce, but I think next time I will use something with a little more flavor.  I was skeptical about using turkey, but it was fantastic!  Texture turned out great.  I added fresh cilantro to top with as well and that added a ton of flavor!  This is a great basic recipe that I will definitely make again and again and add to over time.",

He LOVES tacos so I knew that this would be perfect and it was. I did use a bit less of the red peppers b/c 1-1/2 cups seemed like a lot to me. I rolled the taco mixture into the tortillas earlier in the day and refrigersted them until I was ready to finish and bake them. I topped them w/ all the topping loosley covered it w/ foil and baked. I also added some green onion to the top which was nice. My little guy thought these were great and so did we. I will def make these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
