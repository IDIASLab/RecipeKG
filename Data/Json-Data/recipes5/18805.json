For my family dinner I use a 9lb butt end Bone-In Ham and before any preperation I check for salt content and decide whether soaking is required. To proceed I take two lengths of Heavy-Duty foil and lay them crosswise on the counter. Then I place the Ham in the centre and loosley cover it making sure that is completely enclosed. I place the whole bundle on a rack in a deep roasting pan and cook at 325F for 20 minutes per pound. Thirty minutes before it is done I lift the whole package and carefully remove the ham carefully pouring the juices into a bowl. I then remove all the skin and make criss-cross cuts across the ham and increase the oven temperature to 425F. I then spread a mixture of dry mustard and honey and stud all over with whole cloves. I then return the ham (without the foil) to the rack in the roast pan and finish baking. The Ham should rest for at least thirty minutes before carving. The juices in the bowl will seperate into bacon fat which can be used later for potato-boulagnes and the jelly for lentil or ham-bone soup. I serve with a Cumberland sauce.",
