I followed the recipe to a \"T\" but couldn't get the vinaigrette to emulsify. No matter what I did I couldn't get it to blend together nicely. The oil kept separating and immediately going to the top. I considered putting it in my food processor but I didn't want to dirty it for such a small amount of dressing.

I don't know if it was the brand of tomato paste I used (Contadina) or if its because I used one of those wire Blender Balls for mixing (just put it in the container and shake 5 or times) but it blended perfectly and has not seperated. And I'm not sure why the other reviewer said that it made less than a 1/4 cup when just the EVOO alone is 6 tablespoons but I got about 9 tablespoons out of mine. True thats not much but a little does go a long way. But it's so good I've been finding reason to eat more salad so it won't last long I'll probably make a double batch next time.",
