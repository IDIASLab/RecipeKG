The only thing I changed was I used 2 tablespoons of mayo instead of 2 teaspoons (essentially tripling the mayo) because I thought it was dry as is. I may experiment with using plain yogurt next time for a more dietetic version. Thank you so much for posting this wonderful recipe. I signed up just so I could rate it.",

If I made this again I would double the mayo and take the cinnamon down to 1/2 tsp and up the curry powder. Cinnamon is a strong spice and that was all I could taste. I think it would be a lot more interesting with just a hint of cinnamon. Thanks for sharing Dave. I always love to try a new tuna recipe.",
