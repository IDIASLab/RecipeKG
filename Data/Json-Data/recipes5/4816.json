I had some shortly after I made it and the water chestnuts distinctly tasted like the lemon juice. However when I had some the next day all the flavors had melded together perfectly and it was awesome! (I didn't add the grapes when I made it because I've done this before to other chicken salads and it makes it a bit watery and unattractive. So I just add in some grapes right before I serve it.) This chicken salad is much better the next day. Thanks for posting the recipe!",
