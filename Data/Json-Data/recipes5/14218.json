Chicken stock rather than bouillon. I also used shallots rather than white onion, because it is what I had. Still came out GREAT!! \nNext time I will plan better and follow the recipe, but this goes to show that you have a LOT of leeway with this recipe.",

I used almost every part of the recipe exactly except Cotija (it's difficult to find in some places) substituting it for Pepper Jack. I also added another cup of water during the final cookdown process (I found the initial mix didn't have enough liquid for a stew consistency). A few final thoughts: the tomatillos provide a sour note that may not sit well for some alongside the starchy lentils. If that's the case use half a tomatillo. Also on second trials of this recipe I used a can of tomatoes with green chiles instead of a roma. This is a quick substitute. Finally I'd be interested to see if anyone is brave enough to substitute black beans for lentils.",

First off I didn't use bacon. The oil from the chorizo seemed like enough and I was right. I also think bacon would have just tasted strange in this recipe. I couldn't find tomatillo (unfortunately because I think that would have been a nice addition) so I just used a can of crushed tomatoes. I omitted the water because crushed tomatoes are liquidy enough. Blended everything as suggested cooked lentils as suggested and then mixed it all together. Next time I will use more chorizo since all you really got was the flavor of chorizo not the texture.",

I cooked the vegetables with the chorizo and skipped pureeing them in the blender. I also microwaved the bacon in layers of paper towels for five minutes and then I combined everything into the lentil pot. It tastes even better after sitting in the fridge over night. I will definitely be adding this to my regular mean rotation.",
