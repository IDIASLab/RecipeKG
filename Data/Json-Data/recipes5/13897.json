The brisket was so tender and juicy there was barely a chance to cut it into slices. Not complaining and neither was anyone else in my family. There are hardly any leftovers from the three of us who eat meat in the house. My brisket was only 3lbs. I baked it in a roasting pan with foil tightly on top of roasting pan and put the roasting pan lid on top of that for 6 hours at 275 F. I know you recomended 250 F and maybe thats why it was just fall apart delicious. The ony things I did differently were minimal. I know everyone has their likes and ideas of what they want to do or have no idea and thats what brings them to this site. So this is what I did different. I used only 3 cups of Guinness Extra Stout and made a 1 cup vegetable broth of which I only used 1/2 cup or so. To that broth I added 1/2 tsp. horseradish (prepared) 3 cloves minced garlic 1 tsp. worcestershire. In the bottom of roaster I put 3 pcs. of celery to keep brisket off bottom onions then brisket on top. Added stout vegetable broth (slowly) over top and put carrots around it. In the city of \"Constant Chaos\" great food will keep them quiet for a bit...",

My only complaint is that the final drippings were quite bitter because of the Guinness and did not make a good gravy. I didn't like wasting all that beautiful flavour. Next time I will reduce the Guinness and maybe add more water or beef broth.",

Don't get me wrong it was super tender but I like it with a little more texture where you can slice it. This turns out more like a stringy roast beef. I did let it rest for an hour after it cooked so I'm hoping the leftovers firmed up in the fridge overnight. Regardless this was super tasty and got a nice bark on it.",
