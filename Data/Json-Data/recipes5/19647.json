It reminds me very much of my cola chicken recipe i use.....i found the amout of cider vinegar VERY overpowering i would reduce it to about 1/4 cup.....and probably decrease the brown sugar as well.....theres lots of sweet in the ketchup. Some other liquid would need to be added though.....it would be too thick otherwise. Maybe just some chicken broth. It has potential...but need some major tweaking. The acidity was too high.",
