I loved the addition of hot sauce and paprika but this was a little heavy on the mayo for me. I ended up adding a little more mustard when it was all said and done to suit my taste. You could definitely tell the difference between this and real Hollandaise but it IS a mock version and a pretty darn good one at that. Thanks for sharing!",

The only difference is the addition of hot sauce. For my baked salmon,I chose to include as the hot sauce a well made sriracha sauce and OHMGosh!! What a   difference then to my oldie mock hollandaise sauce! I prefer this hollandaise sauce as standard then the classic made with egg yolk and lemon. Try it and see what you,and your family's preference     is as a topping for any fish,or vegetable.",
