I boil the lentils first and sautee the onions in a separate pan, adding them to the pot once the lentils are near finished.  Then, I add the salt, some pepper and the spinach and simmer at medium-low heat until the flavours blend.  I personally don't use dried mint in this recipe.  My husband would find the original version to be too be \"lemony\" also, so we only add a small amount to the pot, then add lemon to individual servings, as preferred.  Just a thought for an alternate version:  you can substitute Swiss Chard for the spinach.  My family is split down the middle as to which of these tastes better.",

Took all of 15 minutes to put together & 35 to low-boil/simmer, covered to save the broth from evaporating.  Lentils are amazing little suckers ... peppery, almost smoky, they carry the simplicity of this soup almost on their own.  For those that say it was missing taste, try this: Instead of using plain water as a base, start with about 4 cups vegetable broth (or even 3-4 boullion cubes & 4 cups water).  Secondly, I had the time to use chopped fresh spinach, and also used fresh lemon juice ... nice touch (certainly wasn't too lemony for a full pot of soup!).  Lastly, don't hesitate to season with some Kosher salt (the chunky stuff ... the best for cooking!), and plenty of freshly ground pepper.   Bottom line: never use plain water as a soup base ... get some broth, or at least some boullion.  You may even try cooking the lentils separately as another reviewer noted, and adjust the broth level as you cook.",
