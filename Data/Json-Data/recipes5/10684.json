This time the part of egg is played by mayo. Needless to say, you can season this a million ways and use any combination of hot chilies, but the little kick the habanero adds is really nice.",

I was a little leery about how spicy they would be but maybe I was lucky with the peppers. They had a wonderful fresh jalapeno taste but not hot at all. They were super tasty chicken was moist skin crispy. Don't forget to dust very lightly with salt (I used sea salt) before taking them off the grill. It added another dimension to the taste. Thank you Chef John for yet another great recipe! As the other reviewer I will keep some seeds the next time for additional heat.",
