I would definetly double the recipe to fit into a normal bundt/tube pan. It doesn't rise much and barely filled the bottom half of my pan. I also had to add 10 minutes to the cooking time. I would probably bake this again but just double the recipe and really watch the cook time. This is more like 6/8 servings not 14!!",

I wanted a more lemony flavor so I added a teaspoon of lemon extract and I also added some cornstarch to the flour to make it cake flour. This is definitely a drier pound cake... about the texture of a scone. But that's perfect for serving with strawberries and whipped cream or some other fruit that's been macerated.",
