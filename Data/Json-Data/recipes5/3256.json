I put the wings in the crock pot on high for four hours, removed the wings to an oven dish, added some corn starch to the sauce to thicken, poured it over the chicken in the pan, then roasted them in a 300 degree oven for an hour or so to help the texture.  They were a hit at a Super Bowl Party.  Oh, a side note, most frozen chicken wings are ice glazed, and if you thaw them or rinse the glaze off before using, your recipes will be MUCH less watery.",

The chicken was very tender - fell off the bone - which was good. The sauce, however, didn't stick to the wings the way I like it to. The fat from the wings combined with the sauce I used and just ended up being watery. I would not recommend doing wings in a slow cooker unless you like wings without much sauce sticking to them.",

I made the sauce then put the chicken with it into a ziplock bag. ( I used some wings and leg quarters) my husband prefers dark meat. When I got ready to make dinner I preheated the oven to 350. I put the chicken on a hot grill for about 10 minutes or so turning often. Then I put the chicken in the oven for about 30 min. I am rating this a five because this has to be one of the best sauces I have tried. My husband loved it. It was tangy spicy ( not hot tho)and sweet all at the same time. I printed this recipe out so I will always have this sauce. Thank you. Sincerely Judy",

My care group LOVED them! Those were like the best BBQ chicken wings I've had in a long time.",
