I did do something a bit differently; instead of adding both the meat and potatoes, I just added the meat, because I was afraid that I couldn't get a good browning, which is so key. After the meat was well browned, then I added the potatoes, and continued with the recipe.. It's great for those times when you want a break from your regular meals. Thanks for a great recipe.",
