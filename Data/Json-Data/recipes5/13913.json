We love curry, so that was the motivation to make this recipe which I scaled down to 3 servings.  Takes a little time to cook, but it really is super simple to prepare.  I\u2019m not convinced this needs a full hour to cook, so I may reduce the time in the future.  Recipe said to chop the carrots, but I will probably slice to about a 1/4-inch thick next time.  My carrots were too small, and they were overcooked/browned. I\u2019ve never had this Indian dish before, so I can\u2019t speak to whether or not it measures up, but I can say that it was very good, and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make again.  Served with saut\u00e9ed shrimp and white rice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it\u2019s a keeper!",
