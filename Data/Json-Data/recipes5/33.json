        "description": "I'm a fanatic bread maker who likes to tinker with recipes by altering weights and ingredients in order to achieve my goal of a great bread. As a big fan of King's Hawaiian&reg; bread (and rolls), I tried all kinds of online recipes but did not find one that was close enough to the original. While King's does not use a roux (nor pineapple juice), if you want fluffy, pillowy texture that keeps for a few days, this technique is key! All my friends go nuts over this bread.",

I followed this recipe exactly and it does come out with a nice flavor (although could use a little sugar sweetness) and could be lighter. My loaf was heavy and denser than the Kings loaves. I brushed with egg wash for a brown crust on top. However, because my dense dough could have been user error (me), I did not want to give this less than five stars. I wish the ingredients were uniform in grams.",
