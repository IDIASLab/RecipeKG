(left the leeks out) But the rest was the same and it was really good! I thought it might need something to spice it up but the nutty brown rice added a nice bite as did the garlic and ginger. The veg did need more than 2 minutes to soften them up. More like 15. This is a nice way to snaz up plain ol' rice. And gets the kids eating extra veg! The photo is for Sept 2013 Faceless Frenzy.",
