First off 3 under ripened peaches to 1 cup of wine that is reduced is going to produce wine soaked peaches. Even doubling the wine and spices didn't create any sort of sauce it essentially created peaches in juice. The peach/riesling/nutmeg/cinnamon combo was great however using the word sauce here is entirely misleading. Also the pork only being seasoned with salt and pepper before going into the oven? This made a bland pork which in all fairness I expected but counted on the sauce to redeem the recipe. The flavors are on point however this recipe is no where near a state of completion.",

I definitely played around with the chops and seasoned to my likings and added ginger. As far as the sauce is concerned, I would not mix it with the tidbits from the pork. This causes the sauce to become salty. I would use a fresh pan and go from there. I used a cp of brown sugar instead of tbsp. And then let it caramel into a thick sauce.Peeled the peaches and diced. The leftover sauce can be used in the morning over frozen or fresh waffles.  Of course salt and pepper is going to be bland on anything esp. pork chops. Like all recipes sometimes they have to be tweaked. TRY IT! you just might be surprised!!:D",

Diced and added the peaches near the end of cooking the sauce. In addition to the salt and pepper on the chops I used ginger. This didn't come through much, maybe I will use fresh, grated ginger rubbed onto the pork next time. Also, I think ground cloves and/or allspice would add depth to this dish. As for the wine I just used the white wine I had in the house. Very simple and bursting with flavour! Definitely going to make this again when peaches are in season for an even fresher taste.",

I wanted to serve some of the sauce over rice, and it didn't make all that much, so I would double the amount if I made it again.  If you reduce the wine as the directions state, the sauce should be thick enough without adding cornstarch.  This dish goes together quickly, and it would be an easy yet elegant dish for guests.",
