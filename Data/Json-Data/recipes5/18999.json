I ended up putting in on the stove top and thickening it a little bit by putting instant potato flakes in it. The chops were not near as tender as I thought they would be judging by other reviews. They were moist but not overly tender. I did cover them for 45 minutes of the cooking time because in my experience they turn out more dry and less tender if cooked uncovered. I'm glad I didn't cook uncovered the whole time now. Hubby isn't a big fan of tomato based things but he liked them. Didn't love them but liked them enough. They could have been a lot more tender though. Over all a decent recipe and I will make it again from time to time.",
