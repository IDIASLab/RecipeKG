Second the amount of flour was way too much for the amount of chicken called for--maybe just use half a cup. Third the amount of cornstarch was way too much---maybe just start with 2 teaspoons and add more if needed. The ingredients are good and with just a couple of these changes I think you'd have a great meal. I hope you will try this! This recipe deserves a chance!",

If I make this again I will try the butter to brown the chicken instead 2 try 2 get it more crispy. Otherwise it was really good. Oh ya using oil made the chicken cook faster & when it was in simmer mode it cooked it too much. It came out a little dry but not horrible.",
