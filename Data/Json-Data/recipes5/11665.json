Instead of putting the cheese on the top, I actually integrated it with the recipe and cooked it within the meatloaf, which really worked and added a subtle cheesiness throughout. I will definitely be making this again. One hint though: the peas were a little bit hard. I recommend defrosting them a bit (not fully) before adding them into the mix. Otherwise, perfection!",
