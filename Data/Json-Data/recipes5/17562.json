I used 2 cups of bread crust crumbled (white rice) Read review and doubled milk used three banannas no eggs or apples. Doubled honey and brown sugar. Left other spices the same. May sub some pear sause for a bananna next time. Cooked at 350 took out 5 mins early. This was bannana bread pudding. If more banannas were added you could add more bread crumbs up your milk a bit and it would be a bit taller. I served with choice of cream or ice cream. Wonderful",
