I felt I just had to rate and review Grandma's Sloppy Joes because of the mixed feelings of other reviewers regarding the sweetness of the recipe. I followed the recipe closely substituting red bell pepper for green and adding only a 1/4 teaspoon of cloves instead of 1/2. I found the recipe to be delicious not overly sweet (these are Sloppy Joes after all) and the 1/4 teaspoon of cloves to be just the right amount. I do agree that 1/2 teaspoon would be overpowering (but we all have our own likes and dislikes). Overall a great recipe and a keeper. Thanks!",

Very thick so I tried to thin down with a bit of water. It just tasted like eating hamburg with ketchup. I'll stick to my mom in laws recipe: 1 pound hamburg browned and drained one large can tomato puree 1 tablespoon brown sugar salt and pepper to taste garlic salt 2 tablespoons prepared mustard and 1/2 package of taco seasoning or chili powder. It's really good. Sorry about the review I hate giving low scores and everyones tastes are different but maybe I can help someone whos tastes are similar to mine and prevent wasting money on something they may not like.",

I also put a slice of monterey jack cheese on the sandwich and it was great! I was scared off of the cloves by some of the reviews I read so I only used 1/3 the amount of cloves. But I really loved the smell and flavor the cloves imparted so next time I will try the full amount. One more thing - I found it a little salty but this may be because I scaled the recipe to 6 servings. I don't think you need extra salt if you increase the servings.",
