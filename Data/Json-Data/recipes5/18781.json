First the good: It had very good flavor especially the glaze on top. (I wouldn't change this at all). It also made a huge amount! It served my family of 4 with tons of leftovers. The bad news is the texture was just not there. It was mushy. I had to bake in loaf pans rather than 9x13 pan because it wouldn't take shape of a loaf.
