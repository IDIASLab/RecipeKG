Honestly I was surprised how much flavor this has considering how it breaks down nutritionally (often a disappointment there)...it's Super Star healthy but tasty too! Do allow time in the fridge as the flavor definitely improves. MissaLissa thanks for sharing your recipe. I most certainly would make this again.",
