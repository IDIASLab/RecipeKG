Adjustments: Used fresh ripe tomatoes added crushed chiptole pepper & more cayenne at the end. Used chix thigh meat only 1/2\" dice. Omitted sesame seeds. Salted modestly (since fresh tomatoes were used). Served inside a crispy cup (wonton). Best if made 1-2 days in advance. Flavor development was amazing! I'll make again (for fewer than 65 people!) and will serve w/mini tortillas as a gourmet taco.",
