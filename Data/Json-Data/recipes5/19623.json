I added 1 tsp each of dried orange peel nutmeg and ground cloves as well as 1/2 tsp. ginger and an extra 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. Also I'm a firm believer that if you decide to leave your diet for a bit and indulge the indulgence better be over-the-top-worthy so I added an extra 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup pumpkin spice coffee creamer to the batter. Half-&-half would work just as well but this added some great flavors. To finish I had some leftover cranberry sauce in my can so after I poured half the batter in the pan I spooned about 3-4 tablespoons cranberry sauce on top then poured the rest of the batter on. VERY moist and it looked rather pretty.:) Thanks for giving me the perfect base to work off of Jenny!",

I added an entire can of pumpkin and a full can of whole cranberry sauce and then only doubled the rest of the recipe (2 eggs 2 bananas 2 cups of light brown sugar 2 1/2 teasps of baking soda etc.). I added a little bit more cinnamon nutmeg and then some pumpkin pie spice. Regarding the 3 cups of flour I made one of those cups of flour whole wheat. Essentially doubling the recipe led to a full 9 X 5 loaf pan and about 10 muffins. I put the muffins in for about 20-25 minutes and the loaf in for a little over an hour (until the toothpicks were clean). DELICIOUS.",

I used a full can of whole berry cranberry sauce and 4 very ripe mashed bananas. It made 6 extra large muffins and 2 dozen smaller muffins. The extra large muffins took about 45 minutes and the smaller ones about 40 mins. I baked them simultaneously so this could account for longer than I would have expected cooking time. I tried one of the smaller ones warm and it was yummy. Haven't tried room temperature yet. I think my hubby will like them a lot and he will have one of the extra huge ones for breakfast. I'll be freezing some of these and taking some to a friends house this weekend.",

I had made 4 loaves (I did one batch at a time) and I gave one to a family friend and it was not baked all the way through. I had even used a toothpick. I checked it at an hour and it was nowhere near finished so I kept it in the over longer and kept checking on it. After 1 hour and 45 mins FINALLY a toothpick came out clean. But apparently that didn't even make a difference. The bottom part was soo moist. Needed more flour/dry ingredients I believe. I will try it again with more flour and see how it goes. Other than that it tastes good! I just didn't want to make anyone sick. Has anyone else had this problem?",
