Baked oatmeal is a favorite breakfast or mid-day snack for everyone in my family.  My changes: 1/4 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar (1 cup of sugar is way too much), 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup applesauce, 3/4 cup raisins, add 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 cup oat bran and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. I only bake it for 25-30 minutes at 350.  Just right.  Not dry.  Baked oatmeal is great as a \"breakfast-on-the-go\" for anyone who doesn't have time to sit down and eat breakfast before going to school or work. A square of it can be eaten cold or nuked in the microwave to warm it up a bit and then, you're out the door.   I like to cut a piece in half and have it with a cup of coffee or tea around 3 PM. So Good!!! ",

I had something similar when I went to the PA Amish country and changed up this recipe a bit to be more like that one.\n\nI use 3 tsp cinnamon instead of 2 tsp.  I also use fresh or frozen blueberries (whatever is on hand) and put 1/2 cup on the bottom of my pan and 1/3 - 1/2 cup mixed in with the batter.  This helps it be more moist and tastes so good!  We also like this served warm with some milk poured over it.\n\nOverall, a great recipe and is wonderful for when you have guests over.  I have also made these into muffins by adding 3/4 - 1 cup of flour to the batter.  Enjoy!  We sure do!",

The card reads by Marge Weaver, 1946.  lol  Cool huh?  Only thing is, it calls for 2 tsp of Baking Soda, not powder.  Sometimes instead of cranberries we do raisins and nuts, or during the summer, dried strawberries, dried pineapple or even dried papaya chunks.  Layed out in a 13x9 pan, it is done a little crispier and used with milk as cereal, or in a couple small 3x8 pans, as a deep dish goodness.  Really wonderful stuff.",

When I saw that it called for a full cup of sugar I almost gagged -- it would be so overwhelmingly sweet (more of a dessert like another reviewer said) with that much.  You'd be eating 1/4 c. sugar for breakfast!  (It actually made more like 6 servings, but even at that, it would still be almost 3 tablespoons of sugar per serving)\n\nAnyway, with the lower sugar it was a nice alternative to everyday oatmeal.  It baked up nicely and we've been snacking on the leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!",

It is a crumbly cereal for breakfast, like a heartier version of stove-top oatmeal.  I ate some plain and some with milk.  Used sultana raisins instead of cranberries only because no cranberries around house, but you could use any dry fruit or chocolate chips, anything that doesn't absorb water which you'd put in oatmeal.  Easy and tasty.  Just plan for the baking time.  No extra sugar needed to serve, it's plenty sweet.",
