Just for personal preference I added summer savory, marjoram and tarragon. To make it a meal I added about a cup of dried navy beans that had soaked overnight. When everything was cooked I removed roughly a litre of soup, blended it with an immersion blended then added it back to thicken the broth up. Yummy!  Thanks for the inspiration",
