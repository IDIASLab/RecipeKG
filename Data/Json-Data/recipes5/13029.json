A friend of mine likes to add some sweet corn to the mixture and then serve the rolls with Thousand Island Dressing as a sort-of dipping sauce.

Used chicken breasts I boiled for about 10 minutes until they were no longer pink and then shredded them with a fork. Because I had so much chicken I ended up using a little more mayo and added some cream cheese. I also added chopped onions (sauteed them in a bit of garlic oil with the red pepper since others had posted that they didn't cook entirely when added to the mixture raw). I used closer to 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese because I had so much chicken and I just really like cheese. I also saved some and sprinkled it over the top of the pastry. I think it looked pretty that way:) I didn't have lemon zest or nutmeg on hand so I just skipped them and I totally forgot to add the salt. I didn't miss any of them. This recipe was so much easier than I thought it was going to be. I can see myself experimenting with all kinds of stuff inside the pastry ring in the future!",
