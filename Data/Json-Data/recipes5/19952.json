I was worried it would be too strong when I tasted some of it directly but the end result was a subtle creamy savory taste that blended perfectly with the fish with just a hint of sweetness. My kids loved it! Served really well with some steamed kale and rice on the side. The problem I can think of is that some of the ingredients are a little pricey to buy just for making this dish once (sake miso mirin etc.). But I generally have those around so it wasn't a problem.",
