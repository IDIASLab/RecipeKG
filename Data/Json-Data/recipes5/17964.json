                "reviewBody": "I'm editing this to add a few suggestions I've worked out over the years. First an hour is rarely going to be enough time to cook the pumpkin/stuffing mixture the pumpkin will be tough. Two hours may be more reasonable or at least until the pumpkin meat is relatively easy to scoop out with a spoon it really depends on the size of your pumpkin. Check it every 15 minutes or so after an hour and a half to be safe. Make sure you cut the top opening almost straight across to ensure that there is enough 'lip' to hold the pumpkin top for cooking the pumpkin will deflate and shrink a bit when fully cooked so you will need to adjust for that. Finally I take 2 tablespoons of brown suger and 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice mix them together coat the inside of the empty pumpkin as if you were flouring a cake pan then pour out any excess before I spoon in the filling. This really helps to give the pumpkin a nice flavor when you spoon it out with the stuffing when serving. Hope you enjoy this one!",

Also - I drained my meats - THEN added the spices - so they don't get drained away! I used HOT pork sausage. Also I cooked some frozen French cut green beans and used those instead of canned. I also used fresh mushrooms and added them after draining the meats but before the spices. Next time - I will use 2 lbs of ground beef add one more can of cream of mushroom soup and add a generous sprinkling of cajun seasoning. That way - it's great in a pumpkin - or great on it's own (at other times of the year) on buns! Love the spices - they mixed well with the the hint of cajun seasoning too (actually Sylvia's Soul Food Seasoning)!!! I think next year - I will also spread cajun seasoning on the inside of the pumpkin too! Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!",

This is a fun-to-cook festive different recipe that I would definitely recommend you try. Be sure to put a cookie sheet under the pumpkin as it bakes. Oh and be sure to have some nice crusty rolls with the dinner too. Updated review - I've now been making various \"Dinner in a Pumpkin\" recipes for the past several years and this one is by far my favorite. This year I added some roughly chopped water chestnuts to the mix and liked the results very much. This recipe for Dinner in a Pumpkin will probably be the one I make from here on out. Great find Teri!",

Great complex flavors. Would be good with soft french bread or dinner rolls and a salad. (Made me pretty thirsty too so it could be that I added too much salt. I usually don't add salt when cooking so everyone can just add it to their own taste. This time I salted as I cooked. Flavor was great but I've been thirsty for two hours now.)",

My children and husband were skeptical also and turning their noses up until they tasted it. They each had seconds and licked their plates clean literally!
