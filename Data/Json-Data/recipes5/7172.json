Also a little more water may be needed since rice came out little dryer and harder than desired. Sauce needs to be in saut\u00e9 mode for longer than 10 mins and reduced down considerably to thicken. Aside from some minor tweaks it is an excellent recipe. I definitely will be making this again since it is my daughter and my favorite dish.",

I accidentally bought coconut yogurt I added cinnamon instead of a cinnamon stick and I didn't have turmeric. I also used faux-chicken instead of real chicken. It still turned out very well. In future I'll add a bit of extra water and time for cooking the rice as I found it was chewier than desired (and that's from me liking chewy rice). I will probably try paneer next instead of faux-chicken or just make without either. And perhaps make a double batch of the sauce to freeze some for later. And I'll either wear gloves when chopping the peppers or ask my husband to chop them.:D Although this recipe is a lot of work (compared to other dishes where one can put everything in the pot close the lid and forget about it) It was very flavourful and worth the effort. I look forward to making this again.",

There are no instructions to add salt anywhere in the recipe, and adding salt to bone-in chicken thighs after the fact has little effect. I used regular chicken broth, not reduced sodium, and it wasn't enough. If I try this recipe again, I mean to salt the chicken thighs before marinating. \n\nI doubled the recipe (I have a large crew to feed) and there was a ton of sauce left over, far more than the amount of chicken thighs. It was hard to try to reduce the sauce in the IP without it burning. If I cook this amount of chicken again I think I will use the original amount for the sauce.\n\nFortunately my husband liked the sauce and I assume will be eating it without the chicken on various dishes.",

As an other reviewer said, there was a lot of liquid, which was actually good as I ate it over rice for day 3 of left overs.    My biggest thing is the flavor was unbalanced.  If it make it again - and in searching - I may because I haven't found a better recipe - I will probably cut the garam masala in 1/2.",
