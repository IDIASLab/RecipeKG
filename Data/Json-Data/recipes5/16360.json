Let the yeast \u201cbloom\u201d in 115 degree water, then added the yeast/water mix and molasses & oil to the dry ingredients, kneading for about five minutes in my KitchenAid. 2.) I made a \"rustic loaf\" by forming the dough into an oval on a cookie sheet (oiled and sprinkled with cornmeal) and let rise for about an hour. 3.) Baked it at 375 for 40 min and it came out perfect. It looked pretty with some slashes and an egg wash to make it shiny, and it tastes great! Wish I had had some caraway seeds to add, but I will buy some before I make this again as I'm sure the bread would only be better with their addition. Thanks for the recipe - I'll definitely use it again!",

It took me a minute or two to realise it was like 4 am and though the smell was awesome I should probably consider sleeping more before eating it:P Seriously though it has a rich rich taste great toasted with peanut butter and for sandwiches. I made mine on the medium crust setting and it was a little tough on the outside this time I'm doing it on the light crust. Also I have a hard time digesting refined flour so I put 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of all purpose. DEFINATELY worth a try to all of you rye junkies out there!",

I will try cutting the water to one cup next time.  I let it rise for one hour then punched down and put in a 9X5 loaf pan.  I let it rise another 45 minutes and then baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  Next time I would use an 8X4 loaf pan for a taller loaf.  I will certainly make it again!",
