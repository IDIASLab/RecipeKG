Absolutely restaurant-quality shrimp. In my opinion, the caper brine makes the dish -- it adds a certain sourness/saltiness that for me puts it over the top. Very simple to make too! I can't say enough how great this is. If you're planning on making this, DO NOT leave out the caper brine. I served it over toasted baguette slices to soak up all of the yummy sauce...amazing. Thank you so much for this recipe Chef John!!",

My suggestion for it is: you must have mise en place for it, otherwise it can go south in a hurry -- expensive shrimp will get over-cooked in a hurry (I used 16/25 Gulf and shelled them myself -- really, NOT a problem if you have 5 minutes -- also, really, really pay attention to Chef John's directions and timing). Please be prepared before you put this together -- don't be going all \"Oh, I forgot to mince the garlic\" before you attempt this recipe. Do follow Chef John's directions -- and have your ingredients all lined up on your stove top before you begin. Set your timer(s). It especially rocks if you add some (drained) chopped artichoke hearts and some steamed asparagus to it. Oh, also, fresh lemon juice and fresh garlic work far better than bottled/jarred varieties. Trust me. And ... you're welcome.",
