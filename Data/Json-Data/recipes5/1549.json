My 10 year old son is not a big fan of eggs. He had a couple bites and ended up eating a plate full. We will definitely be making this again. If you like breakfast burritos this will work great with that. My husband and son both made a burrito with these eggs. You can use any veggies and you can also spice it up. They added tobasco sauce to the burrito. Next time I plan on putting spinach in this. Very easy to make!!!",
