For the salmon I rubbed in the oil seasoned it with fresh ground black pepper wrapped it in foil and baked it at 425 degrees for 10 or 12 minutes. The garlic really gave the spinach a nice kick and I LOVED the red pepper flakes in the fruit salsa. My only recommendations might be to put the salsa together a few hours ahead of time so the flavors meld and to possibly make about twice as much salsa since it's so tasty! Just added a warm multigrain roll for a healthy delicious rounded meal. Thanks!",

I made a salad dressing in my mini cuisinart (could use a blender too) with 1/3 c of the fruit salsa 1 TB oil 1 TB oj couple pinches sugar pinch salt and pepper. I tossed the greens with the dressing and then served the salmon (foreman grill 5 mins) on top and the fruit salsa over all. Wow. This was sooo good. An impressive dish like a restaurant! We loved it. I posted the pic so you can see how yummy it is. It will be in our regular rotation. Thanks!",
