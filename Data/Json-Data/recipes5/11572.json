The chicken was a bit overcooked so I suggest delaying adding it to the farro for 15-20 minutes.",

My husband hates mushrooms and refuses to eat anything with them (he s my picky eater) so instead of mushrooms I added a can of diced tomatoes (oregano basil & garlic flavor). It was delicious topped with the parmigiana cheese. I served the entire meal with a side salad and butter bread. Delicious will definitely make this again.",
