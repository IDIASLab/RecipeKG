You may be put off by the lemon, but you really don't taste it that strong, it's overpowered by the Worcestershire Sauce. It seems the acid in the lemon helps make the more meat tender and helps the flavor soak in. The garlic is just a hint also, not too strong at all! Garlic powder could also be used.",
