My only remark is that when we added the wine, we turned the heat up for a couple of minutes to high to cook out the alcohol and leave the flavor. We did this before adding the shrimp to avoid the shrimp absorbing the alcohol. We served it on a bed of spinach leaves to add some color and it was very presentable. It was also easy to half for 2 people (1/2 stick of butter, 1 lemon squeezed, dash of worshishire, 1 teaspoon of the wine, 1 tbs of fresh parsley, 1/4 white onion). One note is no matter how strange it may sound, the avocado is essential. It really adds to the dish and works wonderfully. I like tomatoes in my scampi so I added some but it did not work very well after all. ",

Two more cloves of garlic and 1/4 cup of white wine.  I also cut the butter by 2/3ds and replaced it with olive oil.  Really good!!!",
