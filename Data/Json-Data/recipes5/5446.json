Oh well - this met all expectations and preferences. It's a healthy, rich, vegetable-based pasta dish and the ingredients included as written play well together without any flavor disappearing during the cook time.  And thank you for helping me like fennel!  I want to, and fennel cooked this way, a little caramelized with onion, makes a rich dish that would be great as a side or main dish.  When I smelled it after adding the wine I was sure it would be great.  I thought about adding garlic, meat, red pepper flakes, or butter and anything like that would either overpower the more delicate flavors here and/or make it much less friendly to a middle aged woman's waistline.  One notable item - added salt is unnecessary because the fennel essence, lemon juice, tomato, wine, and Parmesan satisfy most all but the most salt-addicted palate.",

Neither hubby nor I love fennel but we regularly get it in the CSA box and keep trying different recipes. This is the best recipe we've tried yet. We both enjoyed this and will make it again. By the way I used the full 1/2 C of oil and didn't find it to be too oily. Oh and I guess I did make one other tiny change: using canola instead of olive oil. Olive oil doesn't like to be cooked; better to use a high heat oil on the stove.",
