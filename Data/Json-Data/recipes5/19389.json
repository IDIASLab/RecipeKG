These are great for Summertime cookouts at tailgate partys or just for get-togethers. The sauce is fairly versatile and can be used for an array of different meats and applications (I originally used the sauce for chicken wings). For people such as myself who have acid reflux I have indicated some ingredients that can be left out in order to help curb the heartburn.",

The only thing I changed was to use chili sauce vs the hot pepper sauce in the marinade because the bottles are identical and I didn't have my glasses on! Doubled the marinade. One half I poured into a sauce pan to thicken on the stove top with two tsps of cornstarch. When I cut up all the veggies/meat I skewered them right away while I had the mess out. Then I put the kabobs into a 9x13 glass pan and poured the marinade over them. This way the kabobs were ready to go straightaway to the grill and there was no need to soak the skewers. Marinated overnight which produced moist flavorful chicken. Brushed the kabobs with the thickened marinade while grilling. Grilled the maraschino cherries and the pineapple chunks on separate skewers. Delicious. The marinade is sweet and spicy. Served over white rice. Fantastic.",

The only things I changed in the marinade was Ouzo for the white wine (I thought the licorice flavour would pair well with the other sweet flavours in this recipe) reduced the soy to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup mandarin juice (well syrup from the can- it was already open so why waste) skipped the cayenne omitted tomatoes and switched the red onion for a Vidalia onion. The cooks up perfectly in 10 minutes and the taste is quite good. The heat from the hot sauce definitely comes through (I used a Louisiana-style one) and the others play to mellow it a bit. I can only imagine how it would be if marinated longer!",
