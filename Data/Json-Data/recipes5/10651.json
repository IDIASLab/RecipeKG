When most of you hear the word succotash, you probably don't think of a delicious vegetable side dish, you probably think of the catchphrase, 'Sufferin' succotash!'

I used canned drained stewed tomatoes and frozen everything else so omitted the water addition since it wasn't needed. Served this with sliced smoked dinner sausage that I added to the mix for a complete 1 pot dinner and it was delicious. So easy to make and such a forgiving recipe - a little more this and less of that for personal choice. I used a whole and large jalapeno with the cayenne and we didn't think it was that spicy - it was the perfect amount of heat. Thank you Chef John this one replaces my own standby.",
