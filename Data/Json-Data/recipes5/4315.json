I give it four stars though because I found the recipe needed some changes.  \nI did the last steps of making the cream cheese filling and whipping the cream first, and I put it in the fridge. I'm glad I did this, because cooking the crepes was VERY time-consuming.  2 tablespoons of batter made the crepes too tiny, even when I did tip the pan every which way. So I upped it to about 4 tablespoons or a little less than 1/4 a cup. I also had to cook it on less than medium heat or else it set too fast before I could spread the batter.\n   If I had to change anything about my experience, I would have made sure my husband was home to entertain our 15 month old daughter.  Cooking the crepes took so long, let's just say by the time I was done I had a screaming baby, a toy-scattered kitchen, and a messy diaper by the end of it.  If I had used 2 Tablespoons of batter each time, I would have been cooking half the day and brunch would have become afternoon dinner. \nTime-consuming-- yes, but it's worth the result-- at least until IHOP brings back the crepes!",

The cream cheese mixture is too sweet.  I ended up adding another 8 ounces of cream cheese just to cut the sweetness and then discarded about a cup of the filling before adding the whipped cream.  I would make these again; however, I would use only 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar (you can always add more if you like, but you can't take it out after the fact).",

I really liked the lemon flavor of the filling but the kids not so much. The cream cheese powdered sugar vanilla and cream proportions are just right.
