The only change I sometimes make is to make a sauce to pour over the chicken (which is especially great to pour over sides like mashed potatoes or vegetables.  When I remove the chicken, I deglaze the pan with some extra chicken broth and add the lemon juice to the sauce. Sometimes I will also add a little white wine or extra butter to it. Then I turn up the heat and let it reduce a bit (and add a small amount of cornstarch if needed). And once the sauce is thick, I pour it over all the cooked chicken and any sides.  It adds extra flavor to the dish.",
