I used homemade apple butter and white whole wheat flour. These didn't spread out really at all. I used my large cookie scoop to make these and got 23 cookies from the half recipe so I believe the servings might be off a bit. I did drizzle a simple glaze (powdered sugar and water) over the cooled cookies. They were great without it but this put them over the top! Thanks for a wonderful fall recipe!",
