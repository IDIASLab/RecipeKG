I will cook the salmon first in some oil in a pan, remove to a plate to keep warm, then whisk the cream sauce in the pan. Then I'll either return the salmon to the pan to cover with sauce, or just serve the pan sauce over top of the salmon.  I found when the sauce simmered in the pan the whole time, the cream had a tendency to separate/curdle, and there wasn't a whole lot of liquid to simmer the fish in.  Very tasty and great for company!",
