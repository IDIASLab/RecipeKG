I would probably use a bit less bread crumbs next time (personal preference texture-wise) but otherwise the seasonings are spot on. I served the meatballs over mashed potatoes but normally I'd eat them with zucchini noodles. You could even freeze half the mixture for later use. I do have to note that using 3 bowls is unnecessary. I just threw all the ingredients into my Kitchenaid bowl and mixed together. Also the bottoms were getting overly browned after 15 mins so I took them out of the oven and let them finish cooking (although they were likely done) in the sauce. Thanks for a healthier meatball option!",
