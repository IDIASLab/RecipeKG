The flavors of this dish are wonderful - the richness of the artichoke with the slight sweetness of the roasted red peppers and the saltiness of the sausage... very nice. The broccoli gives it a nice contrasting color too making it very pretty. It helps too that I could serve it in one of my favorite pottery dishes. The only difference I made besides the broccoli rabe was I used fresh Romano cheese as that is what I have open. My husband and son gave it a four but I give it the full five! I will definitely make this again - especially when I have guests over. It's pretty simple and delicious!",
