                "reviewBody": "Made as written and this turned out pretty good. There are a couple of things I want to point out. Use a smaller dish. A can of refried beans does not cover the bottom of a 9x13 no matter how thin you spread them. Same goes with the ground buffalo. Another thing I want to point out is the cost. While this is good you are looking at a minimum of 30 (don't forget the chips) and that is using generics and buying everything on sale. I will definitely make this again for my own family but it is not one I'd take to a food day at work or a potluck due to the cost. You can buy a couple of nice steaks for that kind of money. The only ingredient I found to be off was the black olives. I bought two 3 ounce cans and 1 can ended up being more than enough. I love me some black olives but 6 ounces would have overpowered everything else in the dish. With all of that being said this is a good recipe and one I would make again. Hubs loved the fact that it didn't call for tomatoes. I really liked the leanness and flavor the buffalo gave it compared to ground beef.",
