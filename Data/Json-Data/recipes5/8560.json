The recipe I used for the frosting is as follows: 1-8 ounce package of softened cream cheese, 1 stick of real butter, 2 tsp. real vanilla extract plus seeds from 1 vanilla bean pod, 2 cups of sifted powdered sugar. Beat all ingredients together then fold in 1 container of cool whip. Pipe on cupcakes and enjoy!",
