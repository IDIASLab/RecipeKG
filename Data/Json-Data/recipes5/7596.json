I think kalamata olives would be a nice addition for color as well. Overall this is a good recipe and one I will make again with a few minor adjustments.",

Next time I might cut back on the lemon juice and replace part of it with vinegar. I used Mediterranean-flavored feta cheese for added flavor. To get a nice crisp on the artichokes, I recommend patting them dry first. Instead of 20 minutes in the oven, you could accomplish the same thing in 4-5 minutes under the broiler. This was a nice change of pace!",
