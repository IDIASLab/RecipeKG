I candy the walnuts by melting a small amount of brown sugar in a pan on low heat and then moving the walnuts around in the melted sugar using a rubber spatula. Then I place the walnuts on a sheet of wax paper sprinkle immediately with coarse salt and break apart the stuck-together pieces. You can use more or less brown sugar depending on whether you'd like the walnuts coated with sugar or just slightly sweet (as I prefer). The mixture of roasted beets goat cheese (chevre) sweet and salty walnuts and spinach is terrific! I've never made it with pickled onions (because I haven't had any) or fried onions (because they're pretty unhealthy). I make the balsamic dressing using my own recipe but I'm sure the quick dressing would be fine too.",
