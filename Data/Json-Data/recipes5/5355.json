Instead of peeling and shredding 2 lbs of potatoes with a grater, I just used 1 2lb 4oz bag of defrosted Ora-Ida hashbrown potatoes. I used a sweet yellow onion and it was gigantic, so I just used one onion. It would have taken forever, and a lot of tears, to mince the thing so I just chopped it large and then put in my Vitamix blender on medium speed about 10-20 seconds, processing them down with the tamper. It created closer to a puree. It worked fine and at least I know the onions got cooked through. Lastly, I highly suggest using a a large plug-in griddle if making the recipe. Only 4 will fit in a standard sized pan and I found one batch takes 20 minutes. I got 14 patties, using a mashed potato scoop, and all would fit on one of those large rectangular plug in griddles at one time. That would save a full hour of cooking time.",

The only quibble I have with this recipe - you have to squeeze the juice out of the grated potatoes before mixing them with the rest of the ingredients or it becomes one big soggy wet mess! In addition I was unable to make them crispy with just half a cup of oil - I ended up going the traditional route and frying them in 1.5\" of oil in an electric fryer - after draining and sitting on paper towels for a few minutes they have the same amount of oil in them as with pan-frying and the oil can be re-used if it's not overheated. But still good recipe and I'd make it again - with those minor changes.",
