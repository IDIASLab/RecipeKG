Sam Adams was the worst bread I've ever had while Big Flats, Pabst, Bud Light etc were good. The nicer bottled beers (go for a CAN) actually don't taste as good, they overwhelm the bread. You really want just the carbonation and earthy beer flavor. Sounds counter intuitive but I've been making beer bread for a long time. Overall this is a great basic recipe for beer bread to play with.",
