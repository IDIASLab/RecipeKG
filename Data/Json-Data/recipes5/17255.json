                "reviewBody": "Excellent. But then it's impossible to go wrong with a banana's foster recipe -- it's just such a great dish. I doubled the recipe and flambeed it slightly differently: after the bananas softened I poured the alcohol directly into the pan waited a minute for it to warm up then lit it on fire. The result was great poured over ice cream though the remnants at the bottom of the dish were a little rummy. (Most of the syrup was fine.) I might've stirred too soon while it was on fire thereby putting it out too soon to let all the alcohol burn off? Or maybe I should've just taken other reviewers' advice and used a little less alcohol. Before cooking this recipe I did a lot of research on the web. There are dozens of recipes out there all varying wildly in the amount of the various ingredients. So this dish is apparently very forgiving about quantities. The alternative flambeing technique I used is actually more common than the two pan method called for in this recipe. Incidentally the best page I found discussing this recipe is a very entertaining read: http://www.gumbopages.com/food/dessert/ban-foster.html",

I forgot the lemon juice (I think I was very worried about setting the rum on fire a technique which I had never done before) but it was still great. Maybe a bit over sweet but then again I had to use Southern Comfort instead of Rum because we were fresh out of Rum. Despite all these \"mistakes\" it was delish and smelled amazing. I ate it over vanilla ice cream but it could make a DIVINE topping for French Toast or practically anything else banana goes with. Will make again because it is so simple!",

The banana liqueur is a nice addition and the combination flames very easily. I would not reduce the rum ratio and if you are making this for a large dinner party I recommend you error on the side of making too much. Depending on your serving size it s easy to come up short and awkward to start over to make up the difference.",
