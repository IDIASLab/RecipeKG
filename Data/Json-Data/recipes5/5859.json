It won't replace our \"go to\", which is the standard for earning 5 stars, but it is a solid 4 star marinade (and, who knows, it may be a 5 star in YOUR world)!.  We used it on a NY Strip and 2 small filets Mr. LTH grilled.  I omitted the celery salt per personal preference and realized we were out of sage, so that was left out, too.  Our meat marinated about 5 hours and that was enough time to impart plenty of flavor.  THANKS for the recipe!",
