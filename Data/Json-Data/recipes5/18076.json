Unfortunately I found the flavor very mild with more of just a \"sweet\" taste than anything else. Mid-way through cooking however I tasted the milk/sugar mixture just before putting in the egg and before adding the vanilla. I actually thought that it tasted more like butterscotch at that point than at the end. I think I will try this again but I will make some changes. I will either increase the amount of brown sugar used in the recipe or I will try using dark brown sugar instead of the light brown sugar that I used. Also I think I will omit the vanilla.",
