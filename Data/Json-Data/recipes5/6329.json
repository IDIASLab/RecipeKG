Should've been covered.\" Peering at the more recent reviews, I see folks mentioning that they covered their cabbage partially, which I guess I should've done b/c the texture of ours was mooshy in parts, and burnt in others. Absolutely adored the idea behind it and plan on doing it again, as we eat cabbage frequently and are always delighted to try new methods of preparing it.",
