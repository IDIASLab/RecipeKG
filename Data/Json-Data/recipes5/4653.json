Amazing recipe: and I've passed it on to my friends. Tangy, fresh flavour. Kept me coming back for more! This is a keeper. Thank you for submitting this.  ***edited to add: If you use a stock that isn't homemade, don't use the amount of salt noted in the recipe; it will be overly salty. ",

I scaled the recipe back using red potatoes and at least double the garlic called for. I upped my herbs somewhat as well and used all olive oil instead of both olive and vegetable. I really liked how the recipe used the hot water while they baked have never done potatoes like that before. Unfortunately I was out of fresh parsley they would have been even better with it. Served these along with Red Wine Flavoured Beef (also from AR) and a salad. - great!",

Made nearly as directed except didn't peel the red potatoes must have cut smaller chunks of potatoes as mine were done in much less time tripled the garlic and used all olive oil. Everyone had seconds--even my \"picky\" niece who then took leftover potatoes for lunch the next day. Believe me there is no more resounding endorsement than that. The picture looked like it had feta sprinkled on top but the recipe did not include. I'll try that next time as I think that would be really good. I will also use even more garlic next time.
