It is great with steamed white rice and some simple salt and pepper saut&eacute;ed asparagus with garlic. I sometimes use chicken tender strips to save time. You can also use shrimp instead of chicken. I understand that many of you don't have sake, but if you use white wine instead, the chicken will not the taste the same.",

I also misread and actually simmered the sauce that you're supposee to toss the chicken in at the end. Simmering brought out some of the sweetness though and made for maybe an even better final product maybe? Would give 5 stars but it was a few too many steps for this frazzled mama. Other than that absolutely delish.",
