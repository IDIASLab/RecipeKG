The saltiness of the Gorgonzola is a wonderful contrast to the dry rub. I cant say I followed the recipe to the T but I was close. I didn't make the dry rub and apply it but I added each ingredient to the each steak individually. Nor did I measure the Gorgonzola cheese again I treated each steak individually. Thank you for this wonderful idea of Gorgonzola cheese and steak!",
