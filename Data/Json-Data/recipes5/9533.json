I followed the recipe pretty much exactly besides not having the two different Chile powders ( I just used regular Chile powder for both measurements). And probably added an extra clove of garlic for the garlic mayo because I love garlic. My boyfriend added hot sauce to his tacos in the end. We both enjoyed this and I\u2019d probably make it again. It\u2019s a nice veggie alternative to regular tacos!",
