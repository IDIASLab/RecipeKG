Wow, haven't looked at this site in awhile... anyhow, in defense of this recipe... this is a variation of the more traditional New England baked bean dish (made with just brown sugar and/or  molasses with ground mustard) and it is meant to be \"subtle\".   Bland and slightly sweet actually with a hint of ginger zippiness.  It is not like the baked bean dishes from the American West and South which are much spicier and zesty (which I also love, been looking for a good bbq/ranch style/southwestern type of bean recipe to try).  Ketchup and other spices, as some reviewers suggested and added, seem almost sacrilegious.  LOL  As for the amount of water you add to the beans, the recipe as I originally submitted stated that it had to be monitored and adjusted accordingly.  Different altitudes (I'm in Colorado) and crockpots will require some tweaking.  Also, I always stir the beans a few times in the last few hours, which crushes a few beans and thickens up the dish overall.  If there is too much water, I remove some.   Cooking is an art, not a precise science...  tweak as you go... adding more of \"this\" next time and less of \"that\"...  which is why there are so many recipes for the \"same dishes\" out there.

There were a few subtle things that I changed only because of previous experience with cooking beans. The first was I added an extra cup of water so that the beans were nearly covered with the liquid mixture. I also added 1/4 cup more of brown sugar to help off set the extra water. I used the syrup I had on hand and it did not come out too sweet. I cooked the beans on high in the slow cooker for 5 1/2 hrs. and the beans soaked up most of the liquid so that it was not watery like previously stated. This recipe was a big hit with the family and we will be enjoying this for years to come.",
