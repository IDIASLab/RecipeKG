I skipped the lemon juice entirely and used only about 1/2-3/4 of a can of sweetened condensed milk. I also used about 2-2.5 cups of extra crunchy peanut butter. Finally I started with a layer of hot fudge then alternated with the peanut butter. Make sure the fudge is really hot when you spread it on the crust otherwise it makes a mess. If you have the time and inclination you may want to freeze the pb layer before putting on more fudge if you're concerned about making it look perfect. A great recipie!",
