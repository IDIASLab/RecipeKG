Therefore I would say cook time ranges from 3-12 hours. In addition to the onion powder I added lima beans chopped onions and two smoked ham hocks. If you have company for a couple of days this is a wonderful recipe. Serve it with the cornbread muffins II family and guest will love it! Also this freezes well!",

The negative ones made me try it.  First of all, I kinda doubt the person actually made this recipe who thought the b.sugar and cayenne pepper was a terrible idea.  Secondly, if you think about this recipe truly it is an awesome base.  I have made many of bean soups.  My husband said this one was one of my better soups, and he loves my cooking.  I used an onion instead of onion powder.  This was all I did to the \"base\"recipe yet I know what I love in a bean recipe.   I added celery. with about an hour to cook I added on can kernel corn and 1 can stewed tomatoes. Served with buttermilk biscuits.  Remember the sugar does change the flavor and it for the better... it give it a rich deep flavor.  Not too sweet at all.  Then of course I added other veggies.  Thank you for this great \"base\" recipe and if I wanted a thick bean and ham... I would leave it alone and add a lot less water.",
