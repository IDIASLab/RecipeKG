So I went and bought puff pastry and nutella (actually, the store brand) and just made two trees this afternoon.  So quick and easy that I didn't even need to refer to the recipe.  If I had, I might have remembered the egg wash--but even without it came out beautifully.  Hint--zap the nutella jar for 10 seconds so it spreads easily.  Go ahead and just slather one entire sheet of puff pastrywith nutella on a piece of parchment on a cookie sheet.  Ease the top pastry on.  Then cut the center triangle.  Use the two half side triangles to make a second tree.  Seal the two sides together on top with fingers dipped in water.  This is a new family favorite!",
