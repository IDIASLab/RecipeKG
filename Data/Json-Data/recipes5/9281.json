I don't see why a little sweetener or dairy free marshmallow cannot be added. This drink served along with another Bailey Almande hot chocolate recipe posted by Baileys with dark chocolate and marshmallow was well received for something different. Experiment with the hot chocolates. This is a great liqueur as any made by Baileys.",

I absolutely adored the added almond flavor from the almande - hubby prefers regular Bailey's but he's wrong;) I would absolutely make this again & have recommended it to friends as a lower-calorie more easily drinkable (not too rich) version of hot cocoa for parties!",
