I sauteed the sausage first so my kale would not be quite so wilted. I took the sausage out and sauteed the onion in the frond and tossed in a clove of finely chopped garlic with about a minute to go on softening the onion. Then I added in the kale and cooked it for a few minutes before adding in the cooked sausage and tossing that together. Turned off the heat and squeezed half a lemon over it. Tossed it again and sprinkle the cheese over it. Let the cheese melt by covering the pan. This is very keto friendly and hit the spot for a quick unplanned dinner. Thanks for posting!",
