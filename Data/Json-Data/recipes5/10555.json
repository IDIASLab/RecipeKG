I substituted a hard mozarella for the gruyere, and did a simple coating of egg followed by cornstarch instead of the batter (to make it gluten-free).  I also added a clove of mashed garlic to the cheese mixture.  I served them with avocados and green chile salsa.  They were absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make these any time I have squash blossoms.  It isn't a hard recipe, it just seems hard the first time, and it is very much worth it.",

I prepared a beer batter with 1 cup fine harina flour, 1 egg, onion powder, black pepper and 1 can of beer. Will definitely make again, maybe with cream cheese and chevre.

I had to add more water than specified to get the batter the right consistency for dipping, but if you eyeball it you should be fine. \n\nThe final product was almost like tempura in texture/richness. It was great.  I might try replacing the batter with a lighter flour dusting another time just for comparison. I dipped the final product in tomato sauce as I saw suggested on another site, and it was a great counterpoint to the richness. Great recipe.",
