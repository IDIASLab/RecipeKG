It's important to drain the artichoke hearts very well otherwise It can result in a very oily dip. I fried the jalepenos (we used 3-4) sprinkled cajun pepper on them and then put into processor. I also saved time and ran the hearts through the food processor as well. We fry our own tortilla chips w/ corn tortillas which hands down will beat any store bought anyday. Besides my husband and I enjoy sharing the kitchen time together. Always a hit in the small crock when I take it places or at home.",
