Using the ingredient search, I typed in what I had on hand to work with quickly--leftover grilled steak, lettuce, blue cheese,green pepper and tomatoes. This came up and it was perfect--and didn't break the calorie bank!  I made a few minor changes, just to suit my own taste preferences, including adding some crumbled bacon and excluding the green olives, not that they wouldn't have been good. I also had some homemade Italian vinaigrette on hand, so didn't need to bother with this dressing, which was probably just as well since the Worcestershire in it didn't really appeal to me. All and all, no matter what little individual spins you put on this, a great idea, and just a delicious simple dinner, made perfect with the glass of red wine I had to accompany it.",

And while the vinaigrette was nice and light I opted to leave out the Worcestershire sauce and instead added just a bit of dijon mustard. I dressed up the greens with a bit of crumbled bacon and subbed some roasted red pepper for the green pepper. I love the addition of the olives which gave it that nice little salty surprise. Very easy to put together and great with a side of garlic bread!",
