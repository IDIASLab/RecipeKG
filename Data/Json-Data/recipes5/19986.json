I LOVE balsamic vinegar and could practically drink the stuff so I had to try this. Instead of cooking the sauce I decided to use it as a marinade.  I cut back a bit on the balsamic (use a good quality one and you can't go wrong) and added 2 Tbsp. of olive oil. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. I used thick cut bone-in chops and put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for a full 24 hours. The smell coming off the grill was fantastic and the taste was sensational. Just as the submitter states it's just the right amount of sweetness and the chops were definitely moist, juicy and full of flavor.  This was perfect served with \"Grilled Tomato, Onion, and Bread Salad\" from this site. Thanks Sarah for a great recipe!",

Used boneless pork chops and marinated them in enough sauce to cover them for about 5-10 minutes while I figured out it was too windy to grill outside.  We don't have a baster for the grill anyway so I used the bowl I had them marinating briefly and made sure they were coated before putting them on the pan under the broiler.  I rarely have broiler success but this dish was exceptional.  I used a thermometer and the pork was perfectly done and super moist.  I had leftover sauce that I saved out to use with chicken the following day.  This is my favorite sauce hands down and I'm not a big BBQ sauce fan especially if it comes from a bottle.  I use a higher quality balsamic vinegar, you can really tell the difference, and this brand I use is Modenaceti Balsamic Vinegar of Modena.  I've used better balsamic vinegars than this one before but never wrote the names down.",

I ended up letting it simmer on very low heat longer than the recipe called for and it got super sticky and thick and fantastic. I let the chops marinade in about 1/3 of the sauce while I prepped my side dish and then grilled. I ended up having to finish them in the oven for 20 minutes because mine were cut thick and I didn't want them drying out on the grill. We all really enjoyed this recipe!!
