This month we read \u201cThe Last Days of Night\u201d about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse over their newly patented technology:  the light bulb.  I loved that this recipe has two different kinds of bulbs:  fennel and garlic!\n\nI used about one pound (approx. 4 cups) of the meat from a rotisserie chicken\u2026so easy.  I used only 1/4c of olive oil, which was plenty, and I added a few slivers of carrot for some color. I think red pepper would be good for color, too.  I served this chilled.  Five stars for this delicious BRIGHT dish!",

Since I didn t have any fennel I Googled it and found that bok choy is a good sub so that s what I used. Just really enjoyed this very different version of chicken salad which is very delicate in flavor. The garlic flavor certainly is there but does not dominate. I did cut back on the mayo (would do so again) and served on spinach leaves (what I had on hand) although I think arugula would be even better. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
