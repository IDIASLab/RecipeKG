Being it s 9 degrees out I had to use dry parsley instead of fresh but even with the dry herbs the shrimp was very good! Thank you Barbra for a healthy quick and easy dinner!",

So, I\u2019m always adding extra seasonings to everything. This dish was no different! \nBefore I baked the squash, I rubbed a bit of olive oil on the cut sides. Then sprinkled with the salt / pepper... then added Italian seasoning & garlic power. \nAfter the squash came out of the oven& was cooling... I saut\u00e9ed an onion with the garlic.... then added the shrimp with 1/2 of a chopped green pepper & 1/2 of a red bell pepper. ( this added more flavor, crunch & color)\nI then added the crushed red peppers,  & more Italian seasoning. \nAfter I scooped out the squash with a fork, i drizzled a little of the lemon juice on it. \nI did not mix it all together... we did it ourselves on our plates. I did sprinkle with fresh parsley & a little chopped ( food chopper) pram. cheese. ( only because I had some in the frig) once on our plates.",
