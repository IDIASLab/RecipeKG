I grate the squash in my food processor (this way I don't have to mash it after it is cooked) and then put it and the onion in a casserole dish with the lid on and stick it in the microwave. I have a fresh vegetable button on my microwave so I just use that twice. After the second time I take the squash out drain it and add the rest of the ingredients. I only use 1/4 cup of milk though or it is too liquid for my taste.",

I had a little left over and added some hot peppers from my garden to it and gobbled the last bit up that night. Thank you for the great recipe! Will be making again...",
