I omitted the sweet potato and celery and subbed green cabbage for mixed greens and sunchoke for jicama. I doubled the pepperoncini but I would add even more. I also used herbed feta. You definitely need the Greek seasoning (I used a mix of oregano thyme garlic onion powder and fresh basil); it adds so much flavor! Kalamata olives would be a great addition. I'll make this the same way next time because the cabbage adds a nice texture and holds up well the next day.",

Agreed it is a misnomer as the ingredients are available all year round but it is nice crunchy change and good for us!!! The only thing I would change is a bit more dressing but don't double it and I did chop up a few more pepperoncini peppers than called for. Do give it a try very different and will have folks guess exactly WHAT is in it!!:)",
