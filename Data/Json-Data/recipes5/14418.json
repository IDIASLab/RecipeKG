                "reviewBody": "This is the second time I have tried this recipe. The first time I followed the recipe I can't say I really enjoyed the result. I marinaded the meat and broccoli for the stated time. I found the meat was very salty after cooking and the broccoli made tough and discoloured by the marinade. 1 cup of broccoli was not nearly enough either. The flavour over all was quite good and made the recipe worthy of a second try - with alterations. Second time around I marinaded the meat for a couple of hours only and blanched the broccoli - using much more this time - before adding it to the pan just before serving. This way it kept its colour and bite. You could use a cheaper cut of meat for this because it is tenderised with the marination. The addition of about 1/2 tsp cornflour mixed with 1 1/2 tsp water to the sauce at the end of cooking makes a slightly thicker sauce which holds onto the noodles a lot better. This is a 'once in a while' dish because of the salty sauces but nevertheless a good standby if you have a bit of time for preparation and want a quick meal with not too much cooking at the end of it.",
