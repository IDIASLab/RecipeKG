The mustard I used was Gray Poupon Country Style (if type and brand make a difference). I took MARGALITA4's suggestion to try it on pork after making the wings (which were very good). I used country style pork ribs marinated them overnight and we all though this marinate made them even more delicious than the wings--so I next tried lamb chops. If anyone reading this recipe likes lamb chops this marinade is fantastic on lamb. Oh don't use bottled chopped garlic in this recipe. The difference between fresh and bottled is dramatic. One of my 3 tests used the bottled for 1/2 the recipe as a test and it was not as good.",
