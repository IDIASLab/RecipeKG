I wound up poking holes (picture is before I poked the holes) over the top so that the pound cake would absorb the sauce (it is not a glaze). A few minutes later I noticed that the sauce that ran off of the loaf had puddled at the bottom of the loaf and crystallized. If I ever make it again I will use a different glaze.",

I felt the glaze left too much of a bitter aftertaste like many \"artificial sweeteners\" do. I was also confused by having two types of the stevia product in the glaze. Something tells me it would have been better without the liquid extract. For someone who needs to avoid sugar due to health reasons I would recommend the cake. You could top it with some fresh berries and sugar-free whipped cream instead of the glaze. The only change I made was to bake this in a bundt pan and then I topped it with some fresh raspberries and lemon slice wedges.",

I did add a bit of extra lemon juice to the glaze because I left it in the pan a bit too long and it hardened so I had to recook it but it turned out great. Next time I'll use fresh lemon zest but dried was just fine. I'm also not sure why the two Pyure products in the glaze (I think the granules would have been fine without the small amount of the liquid sweetener). It does have a tiny 'artificial sugar' aftertaste but I'll make this again. Lemon is a favorite and this is a low carb dessert option - and with 6 grams of protein per slice it's a winner!",
