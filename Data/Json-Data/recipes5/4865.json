I scaled this down to eight servings and used 1/2 tsp. of anchovy paste for the one lonely anchovy.

The dip was light and refreshing. Those fresh herbs were just the thing for a refreshing summer taste. Every last bit of dip was eaten and I was complimented by almost everyone. I did make sure the dip had at least four hours to sit in fridge so the flavors could develop. I grated the garlic rather than mincing it. This gave it quite a bit of extra garlic punch. I think next time I will use one clove of garlic rather than two if I m grating the garlic again. I served it in a small bread bowl with veggies and pretzels. I also garnished the plate edible flowers. I m really glad the dip tasted as good as the plate looked.",
