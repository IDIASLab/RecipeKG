I also increased the baking time to 5 hours because i used a 20 lb turkey ( put in oven bare then added tinfoil after 30 minutes then removed tinfoil after 2 hours). it came out absolutely perfect! the brown on the skin was perfectly colored and the turkey was so flavorful and Juicy! I am def adding this recipe to my index!!",
