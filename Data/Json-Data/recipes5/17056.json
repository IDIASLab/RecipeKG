Served over white rice and chow mein noodles.  GREAT STUFF!! And soooo easy to make.  The hardest part was cutting up the chicken!  thanks for sharing this recipe!  Don't add too much flour or cornstarch...you need enough sauce to saturate the rice (if you serve over rice).",

I skipped the zest and the salt and toned down the garlic for personal preference. When I started, I cooked some spaghetti noodles and set those aside. Along with the bean sprouts, I added broccoli, red pepper, and a small can of mandarin oranges, juice and all (you can also use the mandarin juice to mix with the flour when you thicken the sauce). Then threw in some extra (low-salt)soy sauce to balance out the extra juice. Stirred in the spaghetti noodles and served. We added the cashews and chow mein noodles at our plates so they wouldn't get soggy with any leftovers. Next time I think I will also add carrots, snap peas, and mushrooms. It was so fast and easy that this is getting added to our meal rotation!",

I also served it over white rice and added broccoli instead of bean sprouts. It tasted similar to Orange Chicken you get from chinese restaurants without the breading on the chicken. Maybe next time I will add a little red pepper flakes to give it a little heat. Will definitely make this again.",
