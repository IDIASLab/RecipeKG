I mixed the confectioner's and cream cheese together first then blended in the Cool Whip. UPDATE: I would use 1 tsp of Almond extract with the whipped cream mixture. Mine was a bit flat on flavor. Next time I will cut the whipped cream amount in half (didn't care for the airy texture as written). Overall a good tasting dessert.",
