What I find so ironic is that my 11 yo who doesn t like cheese of any kind to such a degree that we have to clarify NO CHEESE! on his burger when we are out to eat & wants his home made pizza made w/o cheese. (Huh?!!!!!) My other kids loved cheese so much that I could get them to eat just about anything if it had cheese in it or on it! My picky eater LOVED it so much that he s requesting this as his everyday snack at school! It didn t hurt that we made it together tonight either. It was a fun and a very easy recipe to do with kids. The video helped guide us to make sure we were on track. I m looking forward to mixing up the recipe w/ different spices and cheeses as Chef John suggest. This is definitely worth giving this recipe a try!!",

Sifting the cheese into the flour till it becomes cornmealish and using something like olive oil instead would allow these to be thinner and more elastic when rolling out. And adding baking powder would give the classic store cheese cracker look and texture. The spice is correct but I would add 1/2 tsp turmeric for color and a little deeper spice level. I will not be making these again.",

Make sure your cheese is a warm as the butter, cold cheese is harder to work with than cold butter. 2. Do not re-roll the scraps, makes them tough and chewy, if you're making these for guests just nibble on the uneven ones. 3. Don't bother wasting your time docking them with a skewer five times just poke them twice with the times of a fork, 4. Use your hands to mix the dough, at least for the last few minutes. 5. They're easier to dock if they stay sitting next to each other before putting them on the baking sheet. 6. Do use foil but just spray it with non-stick spray  instead of wiping oil all over it.",

I used Cracker Barrel Extra Sharp Cheddar and Kraft Parmesan Cheese, as it was what I had on hand.  It took a little less than half the 8oz. pkg. of cheddar.  The only change I made was to sprinkle with coarse salt before baking. The baking time was perfect and they puffed up nicely.  I was surprised that they did not stick to the baking sheet.  Such a FLAVORFUL cracker!  Thank you Chef John, you've done it again!",
