The comments I would note are: the water makes a very soupy sauce- would omit next time. The butter browns the chicken better than oil (I tried both) but in the end you could OMIT either as it make little difference in taste. Also bone-in breasts are tastier than boneless and were preferred over the drumstick-thighs I also used. I added a 1/4 tsp. garlic powder 1 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper.",
