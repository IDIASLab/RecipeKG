It is absolutely delicious and it consistently gets rave reviews.  Here's what I do:  double the marinade, except for the cinnamon.  Mince 2 Tbsp. fresh onion in place of dried.  I try to marinade all day, but I have found that even a few hours is sufficient. I bake the tenderloins in a 400 oven for about 40 min.  And the biggest tip:  take the leftover marinade, boil, and add cornstarch or a flour roux to thicken and make a delicious sauce/gravy. Other Tips - #1) don't leave out the sherry.  It really makes the recipe.  You can buy cream sherry at your local spirits store for around $7 a bottle and you can utlitize it in many recipes. #2) if you are looking for a good side dish to match this pork, try Baked Pineapple Casserole off of this site.  It is excellent!!",

The best part was the chargrilled outer part -- mmmmmmmm!  Next time I'll probably sear it on the stovetop and finish it off in the oven.  I'll probably also boil and reduce down some of the left over marinade to make a yummy sauce.  This is now officially the only pork tenderloin recipe I'll ever need.  My husband thought it was amazing, as did my very picky ten year old.\n\n\n\n\nEdited to Add -- Made this a week later (couldn't wait any longer, it was that good) and did just that -- I seared it on the grill pan, stuck in a meat thermometer, and finished it off in a 350 oven until it reached 160, about 25-30 minutes.  I boiled the marinade to reduce it to a nice gravy.  Mmmmmmm!  It was moist throughout and so good.  My husband had thirds!",

Like other reviewers, the only change I'd make is to increase the number of servings you prepare, because people will ask for seconds.  Also, double or triple the marinade, and reserve some to be made into gravy by boiling it down with a bit of cornstarch or flour roux.  This gravy is always a hit and is well worth the few minutes it takes to prepare.   By the way, take the time to make sure that you have all of the marinade/gravy ingredients.  Several people who gave this recipe a poor review commented that they replaced the sherry and/or certain spices. These ingredients are the essence of the dish, and really are essential.  I'm always happy to use shortcuts and make substitutions, but this recipe really should be followed precisely.  It's worth an extra trip to the grocery store!!!!",

Followed other comments & used 1/2 onion + 4 garlic cloves as substitute for powders.  Marinated only 4 hours b/c that's all I had time for.  Cooked at 350 for 1 hour, wrapped in foil.  Broiled last minute or two (flipping once) to give outside a slightly browner 'crust.'  Boiled remaining marinade for 5 minutes or so to reduce, then added 1 TBL of cornstarch and moved off heat while stirring.  Great as gravy.  Only mistake I made was making 1 loin vs. 2 so I could save one for later.  Entire family devoured the 1st one so there is nothing left for weekday lunches.",

This was the BEST pork tenderloin we've had so far.  Every bite was eaten and I'm making it again this weekend for company.  My husband..(who really dislikes cinnamon) gave this 2 thumbs up.
