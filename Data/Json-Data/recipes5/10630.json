For those of you who don't know, moussaka is a stunning blend of spiced ground lamb, tomato, and eggplant, topped with a creamy, cheesy white sauce. I decided to integrate the eggplant right into the burger itself, instead of topping the burger with cooked slices.",

My patties did fall apart a little, so next time I'll form the patties and refrigerate for an hour. \n\nThese were so moist and delicious, that I will never again order a lamb burger in a restaurant.",
