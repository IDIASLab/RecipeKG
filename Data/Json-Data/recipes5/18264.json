I have used sugar substitute for my diabetic mom.  I have added oats, wheat germ, flax seed, grape nuts, and walnuts and raisin to make a breakfast bread.  We bake this daily and use it for everything.  We make sandwiches with it, toast it,or eat it plain. It is great sliced thick with soup, chowder, or stew.  One of our favorite things to do is to roast it in the oven with garlic butter for a side with pasta, then we cut the left overs up into cubes, roast them again and use them in meatloaf or stuffing or on salads.  I don't eat butter so i like to toast or roast this bread and then dip it in seasoned olive oil.  Yumm! It is addicting.  Not only is this bread delicious but it is sooo easy to whip up.  No one in my family thinks twice about it. Everyone over the age of 10 has the recipe memorized. I take this to any meal I go to and have given this recipe out at least a dozen times. Thank you for a delicious, easy, healthy recipe. ",
