I did make a few changes: I first sliced the pita into two faces, cut them into small squares (much nicer for presentation) threw them all in a tupperware container, added about 2 tablespoons olive oil and a good amount of salt, and shook it all up. I then spread the pieces onto a flat cookie pan and baked in the oven for about 10 mins. You can literally eat them as chips when they're done! I always make more as we all like to load them onto our salads! I also run the dressing through a small blender when I'm done, because I prefer it smooth, expecially when I'm using fresh herbs. If you can, let the dressing sit in the fridge for an hour or two, so the flavours can blend well.",
