I like the consistency and the flavor of the sauce - not too thin or runny yet not so thick I can't pour it on pancakes or spoon over Panna Cotta. I prefer this to store bought as it is not overly sweet and I know what ingredients are in it. Just use a little more sweetener like a a few more tablespoons if the blueberries are sour(taste them first) or do ALL orange juice - instead of 1/4 cup of water and 1/2 cup orange juice - do 3/4 cup orange juice. If the sauce is too thin use more thickener (cornstarch) and/or cook it a little longer. Most times the sauce thickens pretty well on its own in the fridge however if it's too thick - use less thickener and/or less frozen blueberries (thaw and drain) next time. Same with the lemon flavor being overpowering - use a little less. It's a fairly forgiving recipe. Experiment and make the recipe your own. Thanks you Bri bri for the recipe - it's become a family favorite.",

My citrus loving daughter can't get enough but I think that I would have preferred a sauce without so much citrus flavor. No fault of the recipe (hence the name) just a personal preference. The way the recipe comes together and thickens is terrific and easy. Will probably use this again but reduce the OJ or omit the lemon juice. Thanks!",

I used dried wild blueberries in place of frozen using half the amount called for and it resulted in a much thicker sauce than I am sure is normal. I thought I may have to reduce the sugar as well because of the dried berries but it was perfect. The lemon keeps it from being overly sweet. Served over blueberry flax panakes (allrecipes) it made for a double dose of blueberry deliciousness.",
