It still turned out deliciously purple. Very hearty and a great way to use up the veggies coming out of the garden right now. I didn't have cabbage, so I substituted kale. This recipe could easily be made vegan by using vegetable oil instead of butter and using a vegan sour cream substitute. UPDATE 14.7.2012 - my beet greens were still nice, so I threw those in too at the end with the kale. Everything was fresh from the garden except the mushrooms and beans, so no bouillion cube needed :)",
