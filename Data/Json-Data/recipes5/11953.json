The filling itself though delicious was fairly homogeneous and the recipe made a lot for a 9 inch pie pan (ours made a little hill in the crust and there was still more to spare!). If I made it again I would cut the amount of sweet potato by a bit and reserve some of the parmesan to put on top for a bit of browning and visual appeal.",
