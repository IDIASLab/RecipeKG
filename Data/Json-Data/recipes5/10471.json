I great alternative to the fat laden original alfredo sauce. I followed the sauce instructions to the tee except I used half & half instead of cream b/c that was all I had on hand. Though I expect that it would have been creamier if I had used heavy cream instead of half & half. Still it was very good. I skipped the bread crumb topping and served with cheese tortellini.

I believe it's the cauliflower taste which persists in the sauce no matter how you try to modify it. I made mine according to instructions. I will try John's favorite ww pasta recommendation to see if this improves on the taste next time. Also I should've cooked my pasta under al dente. I didn't time the cooking of my pasta and completion of my sauce well and so I had to reheat the pasta in the saucepan in order for it to absorb the lemon and meld with the flavors of the sauce and cheese...by the time I was done my pasta was a bit overdone. I added some roasted veggies and sauteed sausage to fill out the dish more. I honestly would rather have the full fat version and portion control seeing how this recipe does not quite hit the spot for me. I still really enjoy watching Chef John's videos.",
