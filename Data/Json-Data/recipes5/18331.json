I've made these a number of ways and like them best when adding 3/4 cup of quick oats to the dry ingredients for the base muffin. A mashed banana added to the bran/buttermilk mixture is yummy. I have also added a teaspoon of blackberry butter (can get from an Amish store) or any fruit jam to each muffin tin in between scoops of batter in each muffin tin for a nice filling. I have also substituted unsweetened dried apples (soaked in the butter milk for 10 minutes before adding the wheat bran) or a fresh chopped apple for the raisins and it came out great. For a nutritious breakfast I like to eat these muffins split and spread with almond butter (or peanut butter) with a banana on the side and a glass of milk. A great way to start the day!",

This recipe had all the sweetness, but was just moist instead of dense. I did use applesauce instead of oil, white whole wheat flour (from King Arthur) instead of all purpose, and increased the molasses to 2 tbsp. and the golden raisins to about 3/4 cup.  Baked in jumbo muffin tin (six giant muffins) at 375 for about 25 minutes.  Yummy!",
