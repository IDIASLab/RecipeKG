I only thickened the sauce slightly, as we wanted enough to spread over rice. Served this with fresh steamed green beans, as well.  ",

I doubled the liquid, (wine and lemon juice), used an 8 oz. pkg. of baby bella mushrooms, chopped in half for a deeper flavor and more texture, added a little butter to the olive oil, and probably 6-8 garlic cloves.  Also threw in a good quarter cup of fresh chopped basil leaves, and finished with a fresh chopped tomato just before serving.  This is a quality, healthy dish with deep flavor.  By doubling the liquid, the cornstarch thickening was minimal - just enough to keep it from being watery.  Served it over whole wheat cous cous cooked in salt free broth, and garden fresh green beans.  The little leftovers from lunch today were even better.  A real keeper.",
