The recipe takes MUCH longer to prepare than the said prep+cook time. I also believe there are too many ingredients. Most of the best cuisine is created with few ingredients - just travel to Italy or Spain and it is apparent. Some of these could have been modified or left out (maybe bumping up the quantity of more important ingredients).  I won't be making this again; a little too rich and way too time consuming for a side dish. Don't let that deter you, though, because Im glad I made it and if you love all things mac-n-cheese, go for it. That being said, the outcome is good. Very gourmet tasting, and has beautiful aesthetic appeal.",

                "reviewBody": "This was THE BEST macaroni and cheese I've ever tasted! I cut back on the fat by draining and discarding the bacon grease, and using non-fat cream cheese and non-fat sour cream elsewhere in the recipe.  When adding butter to the cooked pasta, I only used 2 tablespoons, instead of 4.  In place of the milk, I used non-fat canned milk for a nice, creamy taste and texture.    I've tried this with both medium and sharp cheddar cheese.  I think the medium is best because it doesn't overpower the wonderful flavor of the asiago cheese.  For the bacon, I put it into the freezer just long enough to firm it up then thinly sliced it before frying.  Like many reviewers, I doubled the topping. Because the recipe takes awhile to make, I usually double the recipe, baking it in 2 9x13 inch pans plus an 8x8 inch pan.  I chill it after baking, cut it into serving sized squares and pop it into individual freezer bags for a quick and easy treat.  Pepper Bacon is wonderful in this recipe.  My family loves this recipe.  I'll be making it again and again.   Thanks to the submitter!",
