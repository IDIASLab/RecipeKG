Cut a slit lengthwise in each cooked potato and used a pair of bent tongs to peel the skin off. I used a mixer to make everything super smooth. I transferred the mixture to a small round corning ware dish. To top it off in a bowl I crushed three cinnamon graham crackers added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and about three tablespoons of melted butter. I mixed everything till it had a meal consistency and then sprinkled it on the potatoes in the corning dish. With the oven at 425 degree F I baked the mixture for five minutes just to get everything golden and crispy. Result: YUM!",
