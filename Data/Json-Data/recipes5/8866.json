In place of the chicken broth, sub in beef broth. Second,  skip the soy sauce and use Worcestershire sauce instead. When you add the egg noodles, stir them in to the dish, don't just pour them on top and leave them there. The instructions are not very clear on this as written. When you make these few changes, this is a delicious meal for sure!",

The next time I will incorporate some of the changes others have made - beef broth not chicken & Worcestershire sauce instead of soy.  I think both of those will help give it more depth.  I'm also going to flour the meat prior to browning.  The recipe itself is poorly written & a bit hard to follow when it comes to the cooking time.  You don't need to time how long it takes to come to full pressure, just how long it cooks at full pressure.  So the steps about 10 minutes, then 10 minutes at high pressure - just confusing & unnecessary.",

Changes I made - 2.5 pounds of meat, beef broth (just made sense), and Worcestershire (because SO many reviews said so).  Next time I will just brown my meat in another pan because there was too much meat to brown efficiently in the pot.  I also changed the order up a smidge based on my experiences so far.  I started cooking the onion first, then browned meat, then added spices.  Removed the meat mix (to be sure I was able to see the bottom) and deglazed with the beef broth.  Added back the meat and mushrooms (sliced), stirred, and pressured. I did NOT add flour (because I had a prior burn experience with flour), but chose to thicken with a few tablespoons of cornstarch (tempered, of course) after the noodles cooked.  When I started pressurizing the first, I was skeptical that there would be room for noodles but I waited to make a decision until It was done with the first pressure cycle.  It had cooked down to under the halfway mark, even when I added in about 8 ounces of noodles.  My bag was 12 ounces but I boiled about a third of the package plain on the stove for my littles.  This was delicious and only took me about 10 minutes longer than the listed time, which is saying a lot about the accuracy of the recipe because I am VERY slow in the kitchen!  I highly recommend this recipe (definitely at least with the change to leave out the flour and thicken at the end!)",
