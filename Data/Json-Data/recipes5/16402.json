I used a cupcake pan with paper liners instead of the 8x8 pan and it made 12 cupcakes. They were done after baking about 27 minutes. They are SO moist and tasty, the banana flavor shines! The oatmeal adds an amazing soft texture. The only change I made to the recipe was to add about a tablespoon of flour to the oatmeal topping mixture in hope of avoiding the \"too loose\" issues other reviewers mentioned. My topping held together pretty well, so maybe it worked. The texture is like a homestyle \"snack cake\" cake, not an elegant bakery type of cake. Plan to eat this up right away, it doesn't keep very well at all.",
