However the unnecessary amount of salt and oil the recipe calls for made me ill. Simply skip it. There s no need to \"stuff\" the legs either. Just poke them all around (or create slits) and the seasoning will penetrate them. Brown them in oil with a few drops of teriyaki. Put them in a pot. Add a can of Tomato Paste a can of Tomato Sauce then the bacon onion and peppers. Also instead of simply using Oregano and Pepper the following seasonings result in a wonderful flavor: Cilantro Garlic Bay Leaves Cumin Coriander and/or an Italian Seasoning mix (consisting of: Marjoram Thyme Rosemary Savory Sage Oregano and Basil.) Also give it a splash of White Cooking Wine and Bitter Orange. Have it all simmer together for the approx. cooking time of 1 hrs.",

Then wrapped two pieces of bacon around each leg and fried it in a pan just like you would regular bacon. Turning carefully so the bacon doesn't fall off. Then I placed the legs in the crockpot. Poured 1Tb. of Hoisin sauce over each leg and cooked on low for 6-8 hours. It was delicious and easy!",
