Changes I've made: I always use mozzarella instead of cheddar and I use fresh basil, and plenty of it, instead of the dried. This makes a HUGE difference. Just chop or tear it in pieces and sprinkle it liberally over each layer. I use beefsteak tomatoes and let the slices rest on paper towel to drain a while before placing them in the dish so it doesn't become too watery.  Also, I use a little bit more garlic and cheese than the recipe calls for.  This has become one of our favorite Italian dinner side dishes, and it really does go very well with grilled meats.  It's easy and so delicious! An excellent Summertime side dish!",

When preparing the recipe, I 1st sliced all the tomatoes & layed them out on several layers of paper towels on a cookie sheet to drain.  Usually tomato recipes like this are runny but his tip from another reviewer really helped.  Also, instead of adding salt & pepper to the cheese mixture I sprinked them lightly on each layer of vegetables as I went.  I used fresh basil & oregano.  When the casserole is finished cooking allow it to cool & set-up for about 10-15 min.  We had this with grilled Italian sausage & a crusty loaf of bread!",
