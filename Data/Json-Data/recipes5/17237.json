I'm glad I did! I started by seasoning my chicken breasts with some white wine vinegar and lemon juice. I used the vinegar to offset the sweetness \"problem\". I then sprinkled black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder over the breasts. I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe as written. I used a fresh peach(with white flesh though) and used a \"light\" brown sugar to save calories. For the sauce, I used a combo of half cold water/half chilled white wine(Pinot Grigio) mixed with the corn starch. I sprinkled a bit of fresh parsley leaves over it all too. The end result was just fantastic, and even my boyfriend said he couldn't wait until I made this tasty dish again! And, the whole recipe was very quick and easy too. What more could I ask for? Try this, you'll love it! Thank you Lor for a delicious recipe!",

I used pork chops instead of chicken seasoned them with meat tenderizer salt and pepper and browned them before assembling and baking the rest of the dish. I bought a large can of peaches and only used about half the can with some of the juice. I wish I had used the whole can as the peaches were so yummy in this dish. At the end of the bake time I put it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown it nicely. The combination of the pork and the peaches and the \"to die for peachy clove-y gingery\" sauce made this an unforgettable dinner. It was also super easy. I made this for a casual meal at home with my family but would definitely serve it for company too. Thank you for this delicious recipe!",

I prepared it in the afternoon sampled some for lunch to make sure I liked it (which I did) then placed the remainder in an attractive casserole dish to reheat in the microwave later for the dinner. While it smelled and tasted good the chicken absorbed the brown sugar and turned a brownish shade. It was passed over by many people but the ones that did try it said it was good. My recommendation: try it but prepare it then serve it immediately.",
