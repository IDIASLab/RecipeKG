The taco seasoning should be held until the end to add the nice football color. If you look at the photo that I submitted, you will see the pasty color under the sprinkled taco areas on my \"ball.\" I was afraid to sprinkle too much on top of it because of other reviewers who complained of the taco seasoning's over-powering taste. This would have been much more presentable had I used the taco seasoning to color the ball instead of mixing it in with the cheese. Also, the taste was SO much better the following day after spending some quality time in the fridge. I will make this again, but I will make it at least a day ahead of time and I will sprinkle the taco seasoning on at the end to give it a nice \"football\" color. The color of it as written is terrible, but my hopes are high for a better next time. Thanks.",

I attempte the crumbles bacon for the outer layer but that was going to take a TON of bacon and I didn't have much on hand. I tried leaving the taco seasoning on the outside but if you plan to wrap the ball up and tote it anywhere the seasoning either sinks into the cheese or gets stuck on the plastic wrap and you have a really strange colored football. My advice: bring the taco seasoning with you and sprinkle it on once you get to yur destination. The cheese slices for laces turned out well. Despite the appearance of MY football half of it was gone by the end of the game so that earns it 4 stars. Had all of it been eaten like most appetizers I bring it would have recieved 5.",
