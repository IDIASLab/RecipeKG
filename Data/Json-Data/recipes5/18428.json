The recipe sounded so good that I had to make them but I didn't have any dried apricots only apricot jam. I substituted 1/4 cup of the white sugar for splenda and added 1/2 cup apricot jam in place of the apricots. The result was a super sweet cookie with amazing taste that was too runny. I WILL make them again and if I don't have dried apricots I will leave out the white sugar as the jam is sweet enough and add a little more flour. I also froze part of the dough but haven't cooked them yet to see if there is any difference. WOW! Apricots in chocolate chip cookies what a great idea!",

I'm starting with simple ingrediant lists and advancing with every success onto another type of recipe. I found this one to be runny the cookies were gooey and spread out too much without any advance warning that they would be a very chewy gooey type cookie. I thought the sugar content too high with chocolate and apricot (both of which need little assistance to stand out and which are competitive in flavor and do not need a third overpowering flavor added.) I would make a slighty stronger batter with more of a shortbread in the future as that would have a better complement for chocolate and apricot. Otherwise it was o.k. but not an all star cookie.",
