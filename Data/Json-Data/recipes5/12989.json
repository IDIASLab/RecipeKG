I did make it last minute, so I didn't have some of the ingredients.  Here are my substitutions...   1.  No cream of celery soup, so I chopped some celery (abt 1 cup) and cooked it with the onion.   2.  No milk...  Added 1 cup half & half and 2 cans of chicken broth and 1 can cheddar cheese soup. Only used 2 cups cheese (shredded cheddar, not processed) 3.  Had frozen grilled chicken breast strips.  Used them instead of the canned. 4.  No mushrooms...  no substitution.  : ( Will definitely do this again.  VERY easy! One suggestion:  If you have one of those small food processors, chop the onions, celery & broccoli in the same container.  Makes it very simple & fast!",
