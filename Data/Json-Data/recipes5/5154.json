Now I can make it myself as a dessert-loving adult, but I love it more when my mom makes it! I've never been much of a fan of desserts containing fruit, but this one just gets me! It's just fruit juice, essentially, so it's made to please your toughest fruit dessert critic.",

My mother was working in a grocery store at the time and the rep was handing out recipes. We tried them all but THIS ONE was the keeper!! We make it in a bundt pan. Add the eggs one at a time beating for 2 minutes after each egg. (adds more air for a fluffier cake). Bake for about 1 hr. check frequently....cool for 10 min then plate it out...poke holes in cake top and sides using a skewer. Mix 1 cup sifted confectioners sugar with enough lemon juice to make it a VERY thin glaze. Pour over warm cake and cover. great the next day.....This cake is very moist and I think my favorite cake of all time.....so easy and so impressive looking. You can't see the glaze but it has soaked into EVERY morsel of the cake. Great!!",

I've been wanting to make it for a long time but can't find the apricot nectar Mom used. It was in a small can (DelMonte?) and very thick. I found another brand in the Spanish foods section but it's not quite like the one Mom used. The cake was still good though. Thanks crimsontide for posting this one. It brings back many happy memories.",

My friend insisted on bringing dessert. I didn't want to hurt her feelings so I scraped my dessert plan. When her family arrived she handed me a plain yellow cake in a 9X13 in. pan. She assured me that in spite of the fact it was plain it was very good. I served it and was astounded at at the flavor. My friend has passed away and my family has talked about her cake for years. I followed this recipe using 1/2 cup oil. While it was very close to my friends recipe and it was very good but it was a little dryer. I easily identified the difference it was the oil. I am making it again today. I may try 2/3 cup oil. Hoping for a 5 star result. I learned a lot from my friend. She was a wonderful cook. This would have been a 5 star recipe except I was comparing it to what we call \"Evelyn's Cake's.\"",
