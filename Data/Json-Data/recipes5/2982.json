It is meant to enhance the flavor of the meat by giving it a little kick. It is not however meant to overwhelm it. Some people make the mistake of putting to much on or flooding a stake with it. This will certainly leave you with sometimes tears in your eyes or having a garlic breath that will not go away for days. In my opinion, one should slightly dip the meat in it or put a very light layer of the marinade on top of the steak.  this way you taste the meat while you taste the marinade. For those people that think that the marinade taste a little bland, use very very fresh ingredients only, and if you want it to kick even more than it already does, you can add some leaves of fresh cilantro and/or cilantrillo (sorry i don't know the english word for it). Another tip is to cut the ingredients very fine by hand or you can use a blender but the lowest power. The appearance should not be like a mulch. One should be able to see all the ingredients (very small of course)    ",

I substituted cilantro for the parsley and lime juice for the lemon. FANTASTIC. I know this gives a whole different flavor than the original but try it. It's pure heaven! We marinaded the steak then grilled it using the leftover marinade as a mop. YUM!",

Used fresh parsley and learned that the flat leaf variety probably works best fresh oregano small amount of fresh cilantro red wine vinegar fresh squeezed lemon and extra garlic (pressed). Also added finely chopped red pepper and onion. The key is to balance out the salt with the amount of vinegar and lemon juice you use. In my opinion this should be made well ahead of time so that all the flavors can mesh. I served it with roasted pork but Im sure I can eat it with anything!! Love love love it and look forward to making it over and over again! it is GREAT with slightly warmed pita bread eaten like tabouli! Mmmm. This will surely be a staple at our house! Next time I may add some diced tomato to the mix!",
