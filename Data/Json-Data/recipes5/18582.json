Also make sure you drain your bacon before mixing in. I don't believe the recipe called for that and the chili was a little too greasy. And one last thing is I'll add more cumin. Chili I like has way more cumin in it. My boyfriend absolutely loved it! He ate almost the entire pot over 2 days! I will definitely make again with a few adjustments!",

All my guy friends loved it and devoured it VERY quickly. Plus I And I also used Chili Beans instead of Northern Beans and frozen corn for more flavor. Then the green chilies that it called for I used Spiced Rotel tomatoes with green chilies in it meant for cooking chili and also added a can of diced peeled tomatos. Turned out FABULOUS!!!!",

I did cut back on the salt by one teaspoon and I found that this recipe was plenty salty (and I generally like a lot of salt in my food.) I also do not own a meat grinder so I diced the venison and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!",
