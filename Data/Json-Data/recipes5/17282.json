I mainly made it for my husband who has been wanting oatmeal for a while and he said it tasted so good. We used Cinnamon Bun creamer from Coffee Mate and it was the perfect amount of cinnamon flavor. I didn't use quite as much creamer as the recipe called for and I'm glad I didn't because it didn't really need it it had the right amount of sweetness. Will probably be making this alot!",

After the oats had cooked it was a little more watery than I thought it should be. I removed the oatmeal with a slotted spoon to the bowl. I only added a small amount of the brown sugar so I could taste for sweetness. The non-dairy creamer really scared me. My family doesn't drink coffee but my parents do. When they came to visit they had recently brought fat-free Coffee Mate French Vanilla non-dairy creamer. I decided to use a small amount of the coffee mate powder with half n half. I loved the outcome of this oatmeal! It was smooth and creamy. This will become a regular breakfast dish for us!",
