        "description": "A delicious beef and vegetable soup that is a variation on the okra and tomato-based soup my great-grandmother used to make on the farm in Alabama. It's great with fresh or canned veggies, works with just about any alterations - I use fresh, locally-grown ingredients and it's always amazing. All ingredient measurements are approximate. The important thing about Granny's okra soup is that the tomato is the main ingredient, but okra, lima beans and potatoes are important too. Adding or subtracting other vegetables to taste or based on availability is perfectly acceptable.",
