For those like me who have trouble estimating quantities in the grocery store 2 cups diced salmon is about 12 oz (3 of the 4 oz packages was perfect). I also did not have to add any salt because the salmon was plenty salty for me. I eat this with tortilla chips with pretzel or pita crackers or on top of baked polenta. It's a great snack alone with some good cheese and bread as well!",
