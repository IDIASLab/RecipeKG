She has a big mortar and pestle for this kind of thing; I don't, so I end up using both sides of my meat mallet; you just want to get the ingredients well combined and at least somewhat reduced in mass. And since they're baked, not deep-fried, they're a (relatively) healthy pile of wings!  I particularly like them with roasted sweet potatoes.",

I also did some chicken breasts with the wings and they were really good. I served it with a rice dish I do and a tossed green salad.

I put the garlic shallot and turmeric root in the food processor along with a red jalape\u00f1o (this was the only red chile pepper that the store had). Once everything was finely chopped I added the rest of the ingredients and marinated for an hour. I baked the wings according to the recipe except I put them under the broiler for a minutes at the end to achieve a nice golden brown color. Next time I think I'd add 1/4 tsp more of brown sugar for a sweeter flavor and I'd marinate for longer than an hour. My wings were not spicy at all but that may be because of the type of pepper I used. Thank you for this recipe!",
