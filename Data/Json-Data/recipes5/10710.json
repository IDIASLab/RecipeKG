There are three keys to producing sufficiently seared scallops. First, they must be perfectly dry. Second, the oil goes on the cold scallops, not in the hot pan. Third, your pan must be extremely hot, which means you have to use a very heavy, cast iron or stainless steel pan.",

Served with baby spinach salad using pomegranate arils and chipotle cheese cubes....YUMMY:)\n\nPS...because your are using a super hot skillet to sear the scallops...a lot of smoke is generated and at least for me...my smoke detector was going off multiple times!",
