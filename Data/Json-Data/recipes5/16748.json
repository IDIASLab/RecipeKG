Not dry or crumbly at all and SOOOO easy to make.  Definitely double the recipe because these disappear fast and the original recipe doesn't make that much.  I've also added 1 teaspoon lemon zest to the jam b4 before baking and it enhanced the flavor wonderfully.  Tip: if using cold jelly, warm it up about 20-30 seconds in the microwave.  This will make spreading much easier!   I used jelly with seeds and it tasted great, can't tell a difference.  These also keep soft and tender for days - so great for giving. You can't go wrong with this one - tastes just as awesome as the ones in my local gourmet bakery.  This will be my master recipe for these bars.",

I used seedless blackberry Polaner All Fruit and slightly less than called for (a double batch would call for 12oz and I used a 10oz jar).  I made a double batch in a 9x13\" pan and greased it really well and had no trouble getting it out.  I also sprinkled the jam with a few handfuls of white and semi-sweet chocolate chips before adding the final topping layer and pressing it all in.  The key to this not crumbling is to really work the SOFTENED butter into the dry ingredients with your hand.  If you just stir it, it won't work enough of the fat through it and it will fall apart after it's baked.  All in all, a nice, sweet, easy, cookie.",

I use canola in all my muffin recipes with great success I never use artificial sweeteners just cut back on sugars till I get it right.
