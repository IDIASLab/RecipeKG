Everyone\u2019s tastes are different.  For example, my husband likes cumin, but not a strong cumin taste.  In my case, it\u2019s lemon.  I can tolerate a little bit of lemon, but not a lot.  Then there's cayenne.  Some can take the heat, some not.   With all of that said, I really wanted to try something new with pork.  I adjusted the cumin, grated lemon peel, and cayenne to a level that our tastes would accept.  I also baked this in the oven with a watchful eye because tenderloins will dry out quickly if not cooked properly.  After it was cooked, I thickened the pan drippings with corn starch and made a thin gravy for spooning over the top.  Needless to say, this was absolutely amazing!",
