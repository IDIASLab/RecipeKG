I sauteed some chopped onions with the ground beef, and added some seasoned salt and Penzy's California Pepper. Instead of the tots, I used potato \"crowns\". I thought two soups and a can of evaporated milk would make it soupy, but it was fine. Definitely use a cup of shredded cheese on top.",

This was just okay for us and I blame it on the corn.",
