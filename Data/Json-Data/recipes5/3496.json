Watch the shrimp closely and remove from pan as soon as it turns pink so you don't get rubbery shrimp. I also reduced the flour (1/8 C) and added the milk slowly. I used the full amount of cajun seasoning it was McCormick's Creole Seasoning and maybe a dash more. (It wasn't too spicy for us) I added black pepper to finish and left off the salt and lemon juice. I will make this for friends soon!",

However, when adding the seasoning to the skillet, you must only combine it with the butter until a paste forms - DO NOT COOK FOR 5 WHOLE MINUTES! If you did that before adding any liquid, it would result in a burn (this should be obvious to anyone over 10, no biggie, just adjust!).  Easy prep, a short ingredient list & yummy flavor make this a wonderful recipe!",
