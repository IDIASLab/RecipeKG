I wanted to try to bake this, so I put the salmon in a glass baking dish skin down, poked holes in the salmon, poured the marinade over it, and then covered it with foil.  I let the salmon sit at room temp. for 30 minutes.  I then baked it at 375 for 20 minutes and it turned out perfectly!  The marinade is really good, it was tangy and slightly sweet but not overpowering.  I will make again.  thanks for the recipe!",
