Everything was going fine in the saucepan, and then I poured it into the sugar as instructed.  I used my mixer to blend, the sugar incorporated well, but it never became \"smooth\", even after 5 minutes of beating.  It was just a bowl of pebbles basically.  I thought I'd go ahead and press it into the pan anyways to see what would happen.  Oh MAN!  What a disaster.  The butter FLOATED to the top!!  If I had put it in the fridge like that, there would have been a layer of hardened butter on top!!  Please someone tell me what happened!",

Hint: Line the pan with Saran Wrap before pouring in the fudge.  When the fudge has cooled, you can just pop it out of the pan and peel off the Saran Wrap.  This gives the fudge a smooth professional look and gives you no sticky pan to clean!",
