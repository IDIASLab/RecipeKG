        "description": "Creamy risotto with softened mushrooms and a sprinkling of cheese seems like a dish best ordered at a restaurant instead of made at home. That's because traditionally risotto is made slowly, stirring often, adding 1/4 cup of hot stock at a time, then more stirring. It's a labor-intensive dish that's worth the fuss. However, risotto made in a pressure cooker is so simple and quick that it feels like cheating. It's not. This is the real stuff. You'll probably start making risotto far more often after you try this one.",

                "reviewBody": "I made a few minor adjustments to this recipe. First, I scaled this down to 2 servings, but kept the arborio rice at 1 cup (instead of 3/4 cup for 2 servings). I have made risotto in my Instant Pot many many times, and always do the 1 cup rice to 2 cups chicken broth ratio, and it comes out perfect! I also only added the olive oil in step 1, and saved the butter to stir in at the end, before adding the Parmigiano Reggiano, which makes for a creamier risotto. I also added the sprig or rosemary during the saute step, but removed it after the oil was flavored with the rosemary, before adding the white wine. This was due to personal preference, as we didn't want the rosemary to over power the risotto. My Italian husband commented that he could taste the rosemary, but ever so slightly, which was perfect in our opinion. I would definitely make this one again, exactly like I did this time.",

Served it with roasted asparagus, which we ended up just stirring into the risotto.  Super-creamy and super-easy!  (Also, agreeing with some other reviewers, just turn on Pressure Cook -- High and set it for 6 minutes.  It will come up to pressure (think of as pre-heating) for 10-15 minutes AUTOMATICALLY (you need do nothing to achieve this), then when it beeps, which will be like 20-25 minutes later, just release the pressure entirely (this will take about 5 minutes) then continue with the stirring til creamy / Parmesan / salt / pepper.  :-D",

That worked but I'm not thrilled with the texture and it seemed lacking in spices. I prefer my traditional stove-top method.",
