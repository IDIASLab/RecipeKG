Added 1/4 cup water during kneading b/c the mix was too dry. Final result was still a bit dry. Texture about as expected for the flours (medium grainy). I don't understand why this recipe used all purpose instead of bread flour. Bread had a hint of sweetness faint orange flavor ginger undertones. Overall I'd say it was too mildly spiced to be a specialty bread and too flavored to be an all purpose bread. I won't be making this again.",
