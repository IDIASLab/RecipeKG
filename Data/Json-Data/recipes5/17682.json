My recipe of 50 years ago uses 1/2 c. unsweetened cocoa rather than 2 Tbsp. 2 eggs & 28-30 broken arrowroot biscuits. I cook & stir all ingredients except vanilla biscuits & Nuts in double boiler until thickened. I add vanilla and sometimes add 1/2 small pkg. miniature marshmallows stir until melted then remove from heat & add other half package. The arrowroot cookies are broken into medium size pieces (each biscuit quartered) and then stirred in with the nuts. Push into 9\" pan and smooth top as best you can. I usually ice with chocolate buttercream icing and store in fridge and cut into squares after an hour or so. It is a much less sweeter version especially without the marshmallows. Of course I would give it a 4 or 5 star rating with these variations.",

Also it never really firmed up. Kind of like fudge that didn't quite work. It needs to be eaten with a spoon not quite finger food. I skipped the nuts don't like nuts. My toddler loves it as well. Kid friendly and easy can't beat it!",
