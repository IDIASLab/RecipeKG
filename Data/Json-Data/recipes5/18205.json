The limited ingredients are great. It's refreshing. We liked it better with toasted pecans instead of almonds. The almonds didn't seem to do anything for the salad but the pecans you could really taste and seemed to enhance it. Remember to toast them first. My husband actually made this dish both times as I was busy making other things so it's easy enough for someone to make who doesn't cook a lot. One warning - if you bring this to a party it may cause a stir if people have never had pomegranate before. Most everyone at my parent's new years party had never had it so my husband ended up demonstrating how to clean a pomegranate and what part to eat. It was pretty funny as he is fairly shy. If you're looking for a refreshing and easy fruit salad recipe you just found it!",
