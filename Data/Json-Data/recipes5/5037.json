Also since I was using jalapenos and cilantro lime juice seemed like a better option than lemon juice but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Incredible flavor the perfect amount of spice. I would have happily paid for these in a restaurant! Thank you so much for the recipe this is going permanently in my dinner rotation.",

I prepared this recipe and just tossed the shrimp in at the end to warm them up and WOW! Best salad EVER! Didn't need any other dressing but the EVOO I used to cook the peppers & garlic. I didn't have seasoned salt so I used a mix called \"Vegetable Supreme\" by McCormick and left everything else the same. Delicious!",
