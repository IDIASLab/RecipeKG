Thanks so much!  \r\nI made one modification, however.  It didn't taste \"caramelly\" enough to me initially - just sugary from all of the powdered sugar.  So I tripled the butter/brown sugar/milk portion of the recipe.  Turned out fabulous. \r\nTrue to everyone's word it stiffens up very quickly.  But nothing a few seconds in the micro didn't fix.",

What I can say, however, is if you use about half the powdered sugar called for, and a little extra cream till desired consistency, this works beautifully as a glaze. I used it as a caramel glaze for apple muffins (1/2 recipe was just right for 12) and it was perfect--exactly what I was looking for! When hubs came home from work I had him taste a little dab of it for his opinion and he instantly knew it was caramel and thought it was very good! Smooth, not grainy, with a beautiful caramel color. I'll remember to use this again in just the same way for a great caramel icing for muffins or coffeecakes. It does, however, dry hard, so I'm not so sure I would like it as a cake frosting...",

I now triple it for a 3 layer cake.\n\nI did not have any of the other problem as stated by others. It was not runny not did it crack on me, but all that has to do with timing tho. You must vigorotsly boil this to have a good turn out. It does ser quickly therefor it is to be poured and not spread on.",
