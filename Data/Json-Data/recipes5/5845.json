SO note I'm not an expert but this recipe was epically a disaster. So I'll break it down on where I hade issues. Direction 1. No specific size springform so I used a 12in after looking at the ingredients. 1 tsp of melted coconut oil didn't cover much of anything. I had to use more then then a tbsp. Direction 3. There was more butter then coconut flour & I couldn't get it to resemble coarse crumbs for nothing & I had my butter in the freezer for an hour prior so it didn't melt with working with it. I ended up adding more coconut flour (close to 4tbsp additionally). Direction 5. I mixed wet & dry separately & added together. Everything else was standard to a T. I took my time with this recipe & felt it was going to be good. But 35 minutes into baking it it was burning on the top did a prick test for doneness & wasn't ready. So I tented it with foil to prevent anymore scorching. At the 40 minute mark checked again & the edges of the cake were already extremely dark pricked again & came out clean. I pulled immediately. Waited the allotted time removed the ring from the pan tried to cut a portion only to have the cake crumble & split. The layers didn't bind or marry together at all & the bottom still stuck to the foil. It tasted awful nothing like it should taste & the fruit was still crunchy. Sorry...was very disappointed.",
