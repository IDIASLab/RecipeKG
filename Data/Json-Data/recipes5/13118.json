Cheaper bags will open up and ruin the omelet. Second, use a straw to suck all the air out of the bag after mixing the ingredients or just lay the bag against a sharp corner of a table with the egg mixture below the edge and the top of the bag flat on the table top. Press out the air and seal. Use whatever ingredients you like but crumbled bacon or sausage is my favorite. If you do a three-egg omelet, increase the cooking time to 15 minutes.",

Then one of the kids wrote the names of everyone on the bags. This turned out cute because he was only seven we wouldn't tell him how to spell anyon's name so he had to guess how to spell names and it was funny to see what he came up with. Everyone threw in what they wanted. The kids shook the bags for everyone. Then we (adult supervision is a must with the hot boiling water) cooked them in a huge pot of water. The bigger the pot, the better. Using a big pot helps to keep the bags from hitting the sides of the pot and melting. We gently stirred them around too, which helped. We served them with a bunch of quick breads we cooked ahead at home and fresh fruit. They were a huge hit and the kids really felt like they were contributing to the group effort. The best guage for time was to pull the bag out and give it a little squeeze to see if it was firm enough.",
