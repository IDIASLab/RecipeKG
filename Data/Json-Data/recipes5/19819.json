You may devise whatever combinations are convenient and inexpensive for you. Throw in whatever's in season, also leftovers you've got (cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving, oatmeal from breakfast, old bread, etc.) Mincemeat will take anything, it seems, and still taste just exactly the same -- that is, exquisite! So for Heaven's sake make whatever changes are thrifty for you, but you may keep the quantities about the same.",

The next time I will use 6 apples since I thought there could me more filling in a 9\" pie and I may cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup but those are personal choices and no reflection on the recipe.
