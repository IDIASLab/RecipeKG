This recipe is the closest thing to the lumpia his mother makes.  The only changes I tried were to half the green onions and add in 1/4 cup chopped fresh green beans, omit the salt and use low sodium soy sauce and add 2 tsps Adobo seasoning to the meat.  This adds a little more flavor without too much extra salt.  I also doubled the recipe and made beef, beef and pork, and just pork lumpia.  We like the mixture of beef and pork best!  We also dip our lumpia in a sweet chili sauce, which can be found in any asian market.  This is a GREAT recipe!  Thanks Christina.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great base recipe.  Lumpia recipes are flexible and you can add or subtract whatever you want.  Traditionally the raw meat is mixed with the spices, rolled, and cooked.  One advantage to precooking the meat is you can add more spices/ingredients to taste after the meat is cooked.  Before I remove the final mixture from the stove I will add dashes of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil until it tastes the way I want it.  Another good tip is to let the final mixture sit over night. This makes a big difference in the following: 1. the juices/spices coagulate and soak into the meat giving a much nicer flaver 2. Rolling is much easier because the filling is no longer wet and soaking into the wrappers 3. Since the wrappers don't absorb all of the moisture, they brown very slowly and you get a super crisp lumpia without over browning the outside and blackening the ends.  Thanks again for the recipe!!",
