Later review: Oh my goodness! This has become our new favourite salad dressing. It is sooooooo good!!! I do use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic simply because I think it might keep longer than with the fresh garlic. And don't think you can shake it up in the bottle like some other dressings. If you do that it won't thicken properly. Make sure you stream the olive oil in while blending like the recipe directs. Get your mouth ready for a big treat here! Lots of flavour! It would make a great sauce or marinade for fish or chicken. Tonight I used it to dip my leftover roast beef into when I didn't feel like using ketchup. Ooo la la!",
