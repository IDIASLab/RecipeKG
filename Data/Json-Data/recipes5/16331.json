They took NO extra time to bake because while the oatmeal was soaking I went ahead and measured all the other ingredients out, turned on the oven, and put liners in the muffin cups.  They were absolutely wonderful and yummy.  I will use this recipe many more times.  Everyone LOVES them!  Very moist and delicious!  I freeze them and keep them around! Usually I double the recipe, cut the oil in half, and use half whole wheat flour and half white flour, which really adds some flavor to the muffins.",

I omitted the nuts (known nut allergy in the group) and substituted some butterscotch chips along with mini chocolate chips. I found these difficult to get out of the tins, as the topping wanted to adhere itself and then broke apart in places as I tried to release them. As for taste, if it wasn't for the chocolate and butterscotch chips there wouldn't be much flavor at all (maybe I should have added vanilla) and what flavor there was seemed to have an almost starchy/acrid taste (maybe too much baking powder and salt?). There was no way I would send these with hubs--if I'm not proud of what I make or want to eat it myself it's not good enough for anyone else. I hate to waste food or my time, but knowing hubs and I wouldn't eat them either, they went into the garbage.  ",

I used old fashioned oats.  I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  I added 1 t vanilla.  I used 1/2 cup ap flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup flaxseed.  I used 3 1/2 t baking powder and 3/4 t salt.  I used miniature chocolate chips.  They turned out soooo good.  They were very moist and I think the topping made the muffin even better.  My 3 year old yummed it right up.  Thanks for a great starter recipe.  ",
