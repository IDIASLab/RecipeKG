After preparing the garlic/crumb mixture I sauted the chicken in the same pan. I added salt and pepper and the some Worcestershire sauce (about a tablespoon) and some chicken broth. Cooked the chicken until it was done and decided it needed a little kick. Siracha sauce is the old standby so I squirted some of that in. More cooking tasted and it was great. I then added the egg noodles (what I had) and the crumb mixture. It soaked up all of the juice. The dish was great but I would make with thighs next time. I doubled the chicken without doubling the crumb mixture since I had two breasts in the package. It worked fine just more chicken.",
