I did half with the puree and half with diced figs. On all of them instead of just putting \"a few ribbons\" of basil I covered the whole piece of bread with basil which I think added a lot of flavor. The ones with the puree had more flavor held the vinegar better and you could put a lot more topping than with the diced figs. The diced fig ones were noticeably less flavorful probably because they didn't hold as much vinegar. If I make this again I will do the puree and add the vinegar to the puree instead of drizzling.",
