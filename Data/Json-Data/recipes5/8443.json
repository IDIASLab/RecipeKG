I didn't have chocolate chips so I substituted 4 oz. semi-sweet chocolate.  I also could not find 5 oz. cans of sweetened condensed milk so used a full 14 oz. can.  I took Cookiesprite's suggestion for the topping and melted 1 oz. semi-sweet chocolate and dded 1 tbsp. of butter to make the chocolate coating for the top. The last few times I have reduce the peanut butter to 1/2 c., as it was a little to peanut-buttery for us, and add an additional 4 oz. cream cheese.  We really like the crust, by the way!

Most of the ingredients I found cheaply at Grocery Outlet so it wasn't expensive to make. I did use Super-Chunk peanut butter and I sprinkled the top with chopped honey-roasted peanuts. I don't care for peanut butter and chocolate and I liked this as did my husband whose a Reese's fanatic. I think using the homemade whipped cream really makes it good. NOTE: This is a VERY rich pie. Make sure you cut small wedges of this and share with your friends/family! This would be great for a potluck or family dinner.",

I took the advise to reduce the rice crispies to about 1 3/4 cups and increased the chocolate chips (I used milk chocolate) to about 1 1/4 cups. next time I would probably reduce the whipped cream to 3/4 c to give a little firmer texture. we also left this in the refridgerator instead of freezer. was wonderful!

The only thing I changed when I made this was I didn't have any vanilla probably would have been better with it. And I didn't have any chocolate sauce so I took milk chocolate chips which I used for the base also and melted them in the microwave with some butter about a tablespoon or two to a half cup or you could use regular oil kind of like you do when making a coating to dip truffles in. Then I drizzled this over the top of the pie and ran a wooden skewer through the chocolate to make a spiral spoke pattern then again making lines like cutting a pie. Not only was it pretty but the chocolate topping hardened to a softer version of a hard shell for ice cream. Sauce or this topping it's all good! I made this for a 15 year old boy's birthday and all the kids loved it their mom said this recipe is great for ice cream she has Celiacs and couldn't eat the crust so I put some filling into a bowl and topped it with the chocolate then froze it she loved it. Thanks for the great recipe! Cheers...",
