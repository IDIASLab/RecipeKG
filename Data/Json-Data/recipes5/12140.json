The boyfriend and I found that some of the recipe was vague, particularly the direction about adding the flour to the \"remaining butter\" which was quite hard and ended up with me straining out the lumps of flour. It might be better to just add the flour after you put in the half and half while stirring, but that is just something we ran into. It was super delicious. We served it with mashed parsnips and cornbread.",
