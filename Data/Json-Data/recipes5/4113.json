                "reviewBody": "I have made this recipe many times over the past couple of years and love it. Actually, I like the meat preparation method here better than that for traditional gyro meat (using ground lamb, etc.) Here are the changes I make to the marinade part of the recipe: (a) substitute extra virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil; (b) omit the brandy completely (usually I add a little extra lemon juice and no more than a couple of teaspoons of balsamic vinegar); (c) drastically increase the marinade herbs (i.e. 1 tsp. each of rosemary, thyme, oregano, pepper, and marjoram along with an extra clove or so of garlic); and d) add a teaspoon or so of dried chicken broth granules to the marinade. If it's available, I buy fresh cubed lamb stew meat for this recipe--saves a lot of time cubing meat and trimming fat away. Also, I don't bother with the skewers when roasting the lamb. They really aren't necessary as long as you have some way of draining the fat/juices off of the meat while it's roasting (e.g. using a broiler pan). Finally, I like Yia Yia's Tzatziki Sauce(on this site) better than the tzatziki recipe given here. If the tzatziki is too bland for your taste, try adding in a little freshly ground pepper, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, lemon juice, and/or olive oil. Finally, don't skip the feta cheese (even though the recipe says it's optional)--it adds wonderful flavor to the finished product. These gyros are GOOD! Thanks for the recipe!",
