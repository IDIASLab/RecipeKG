I don't know about grating (?) tomato but I just chopped mine into a very small dice and that worked out well. I wouldn't recommend putting the salmon in for the full 10 mins to simmer. Since it's already cooked it was starting to fall apart after only 4-5 mins and I didn't want to overcook it. I served it over brown jasmine which definitely completed the dish. Yum!",
