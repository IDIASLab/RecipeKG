I made my half exactly as written (with 1 tbsp of parmesan in my half) and omitted the parmesan for her. We both loved it - so nice and fresh and healthy. As it turns out as much as I love cheese I didn't really notice the parmesan in my half so some people may choose to omit it. One minor thing: I used a very large red onion for this and I thought it was too much so others might be advised to use a medium or small one (or a half onion like one reviewer suggested). I had mine by itself on a plate and served hers on a bed of hearts of romaine - a great salad either way. I'm going to make a double batch for her next weekend and so on.
