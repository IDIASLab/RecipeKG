I always prefer more vegetables so I added chopped carrot bell pepper and two jalapenos at the same time as the potato and for the last 10 minutes some frozen peas that I had on hand. Many vegetables would go well in this dish. I also added a chicken bouillon cube to the water. Salt was a must add! Awesome recipe! Everyone was begging for more and for thee recipe.",
