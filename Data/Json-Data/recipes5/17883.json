I used 3/4c brown sugar and only 1 Tbls. corn syrup.  (Now that I have made this I might sub maple syrup for the corn syrup next time.)  I only used 4 eggs and it was plenty \"eggy\".  I can see what others were talking about.  I was able to fit 8 slices of French Bread in the 9\" x 13\" pan.  I left the crusts on with excellent results.  I would suggest not skimping on the orange liqueur as it definitely added the extra layer of flavor that made it an \"over the top\" recipe.  Our liqueur stores sell small samples of liqueur at the registers, and I was able to buy that for just a couple bucks!!  I sprinkled the top with cinnamon before baking.  Would recommend that too.  After the casserole was done baking I flipped all the slices over and put the dish under the broiler for just a few minutes to brown the tops until golden brown.",

I make a couple of changes as follows: I use 1/2 teaspoon orange extract in place of the liqueur or omit it entirely - you won't really miss it. Use challah or Hawaiian sweet bread instead of french bread. Don't bother to remove the crusts and pack your pan tightly with bread pieces cut 1\" thick to absorb the excess liquid. (I use almost an entire loaf of challah for one pan.) Melt the butter in the microwave, stir in the brown sugar and corn syrup and then pour into the pan. The sugar will dissolve during the baking process. No need to bring the pan to room temperature before baking. Invert the pieces as you serve them. The brown sugar mixture is a substitute for syrup, don't use additional syrup when you serve or it will be too sweet.",

I read ALL the reviews before I proceeded and combined all the wonderful suggestions as I beleive that helped make this recipe even better. I used a large loaf of 2-day old French bread and left crusts on --- this is soooo key and especially helpful in \"flipping\" half-way through baking (you MUST to this to saturate the bread fully otherwise too eggy as others warned) and then again at the end before broiling to get the caramel sauce nice and brown and bubbly. If you left the crusts OFF I beleive it would be too soggy and not as \"chewy\". I made it with 4 egss and thought it turned out great. I used 1 TBL vanilla vs 1 tsp. The Grand Marnier is a must or do something to bring out the orange flavor even more (I will add orange zest next time in additon to a TBL more of GM). I did add cinnamon to egg mixture before dipping each slice of bread into it. Then I poured the remaining egg mixture over the entire thing before putting in fridge overnight. I used 1 TBL maple syrup v. corn syrup (liked this!!). Served with slices of strawberries for more elegant presentation (will do seasonal berry for future). I used about 8 slices of bread per pan (vs 6) at LEAST 1 inch thick is a must as well and liked having these individual servings when flipping and plating. I also like the idea of using a Frenc",

Mine turned out a bit eggy but I think maybe that was my fault - I didn't beat the eggs enough. But it was pretty and fluffy when it was finished. Still I'm considering cutting out one of the eggs the next time I make it. I did make some changes though. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and only 1 tblsp of corn syrup. It was the perfect amount of sweetness. I didn't bother to remove the crust from the bread. It's not necessary. Also to all of those people who are leaving out the Grand Marnier you are missing the point... the orange flavor is what gives this its Creme Brulee taste! As for me I decided to use 1/2 tsp. of orange extract instead and that did the trick for me. Just a hint of citrus much like Creme Brulee. I cooked it for about 37 minutes and it came out perfectly. It was a practice run for a shower brunch I'm throwing & I'll definitely leave it on the menu.",
