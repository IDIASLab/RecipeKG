I don't use butter-flavored shortening so I just used the traditional type and I prepared the dough exactly as specified. I would do precisely the same thing next time - to do otherwise would be messing with perfection. I did NOT however grease the cookie sheets. Perfectly spiced perfectly cinnamony perfectly tender light crispy and chewy. Perfectly beautiful too. This is just a perfect cookie all the way around! I used Hershey's cinnamon chips which I know are only sold in limited regions of the country. But the cinnamon chips are really essential in this cookie so if you can do seek them out rather than eliminating them or making substitutions. While it may be pricey to order them online I've seen them at King Arthur Flour Calico Bean Market and on Amazon. One of the better cookies I've ever made above average in my opinion. Great \"cookie-jar\" cookie.",

I don't have shortening on hand so I used butter in it's place. I don't normally keep a lot of brown sugar on hand and I never have dark brown sugar on hand at all so I used half white and half light brown sugar and for the extra quarter cup of dark brown that the recipe asked for I added 1/4 cup of molasses (which is what google told me to sub in a pinch). To compensate for the extra moisture that the molasses added to the recipe I added an additional quarter cup of flour. I did not add the full amount of salt a half teaspoon was plenty. After I added the one cup of cinnamon chips I didn't think that was near enough so I dumped the rest of the bag in. The more the merrier right? This recipe turned out a soft and chewy cookie which is a favorite in this house. Very cinnamon-y and just......wonderfully comforting. What I liked best about this cookie dough is it was ready to go right off you didn't have to chill the dough even with using butter and it didn't spread much and it adapted well to substitutions which I think speaks volumes for a great recipe. I'll make this again! NOTE: Next time I make these I'll roll them in sugar. I think they might be prettier that way.",
