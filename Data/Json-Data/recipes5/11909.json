Definitely needs jalapeno extra garlic cumin chili and oregano. I was trying to use up leftovers so threw in home made black beans leftover street corn leftover rotel cheese dip and fresh chopped cilantro and tomatoes. Used chicken broth to make it thinner and added some rice and let it all simmer covered till thick and the rice was cooked. I crumbled tortilla chips with a bit of Mexican blend cheese for the topping. Worked out great. Didn't mean to change it so much but it is a great starting point to add your own thing to.",
