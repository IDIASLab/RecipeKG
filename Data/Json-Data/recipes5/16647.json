I have been looking for a simplified mincemeat pie recipe since I attended a semester of college in London---the refectory at my school had mini-mincemeat pies every day for the entire month of December....and I NEVER tired of them! These bars come close in flavor without all the hassle of making your own mincemeat or bothering with a crust. I followed the recipe exactly except I used an entire (27-oz) jar of mincemeat and just zested a whole orange instead of measuring. Thank you so much for this recipe--it will definitely be a tradition in my family from now on!!!",
