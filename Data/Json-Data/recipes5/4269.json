This was a HIT with my guests for dinner, super easy to prepare, gorgeous presentation and doesnt matter what temperature its served at, so its ideal for a get together.  I did not cut up the shrimp or even go through the process of shelling and flavoring the pasta with the shrimp.  I did, however, cook the asparagus in the same water as the pasta.  For the commenter below who said their asparagus turned brown, they need to remove it from the water when its cooked and immediately put it into cold water to stop the cooking process, it wont brown if it gets shocked immediately.   For depth I added some sliced grape tomatoes and some sliced black olives, and now that I've tried it both warm and cold... the flavors really come out after its been chilled overnight! When I do it again I might consider adding some small cubes of cheese, but depends what I have on hand.  Try this, you won't be disappointed! ",

Simplicity is key for me:) I also use the basil that's already minced in the tube. I know fresh basil is better- but it still tastes awesome:) I get compliments on this dish all the time!!",
