I had forgotten to preheat the oven and wanted to really sear the breasts first so I needed the extra lemon juice to ensure nothing burned. I also used bouquet garni instead of straight tarragon. The flavor ended up being quite good from the mix of herbs. My husband and kids were quite happy with it and I couldn't believe how easy it was. I'm definitely going to experiment with this one!
