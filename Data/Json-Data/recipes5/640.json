I add a pinch to the onion/zucchini mixture while sauteeing which really helped bring out the flavors of the vegetables. Very easy to make and a healthy filling breakfast - or in my case dinner! I sprinkled a bit of extra feta over top before serving. I did need to adjust the salt a bit at the end with a couple twists of my sea salt grinder. The dill really makes the dish and I imagine using fresh dill would be even tastier.",
