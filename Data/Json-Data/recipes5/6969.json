While normally shawarma is sliced off a rotisserie, it can be made at home with just a few changes. Be warned, it takes a day of prep time. For lunch, serve as a sandwich in warmed flatbread with cucumber sauce, sliced onion, and seeded tomato. For dinner, serve with rice and lentils (for a treat, look up mujadarrah on this site).",

I served on mediterranean pita bread with tomatoes, lettuce, cucumber, red onion, feta, and a lemon yogurt sauce.",
