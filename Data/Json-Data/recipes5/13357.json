I made the first batch without spraying oil on the top of them, and they were not the right texture. I sprayed them with oil for second batch, and I sprinkled a little bit of garlic salt into one of them. That one was much more flavorful and delicious than the originals, so I put garlic salt in the rest of the filling. Yummy! \n\nDo not over stuff these. I put more than the 1 tsp of filling called for, but they often busted open during cooking. The ones with less filling remained intact.",
