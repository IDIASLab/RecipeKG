But this was really not very good and after doing some looking it seems that the proportions are \"backwards\" from most michelada recipes. This had one part beer to 3 of clamato -- the majority of recipes are showing 1 part clamato to 3 or 4 parts beer! No offense but to me this ended up being bizarre tomato juice rather than a beer cocktail. I think I will try a more \"straight\" version and honestly I hope someone posts \"the usual\" version so that there's better representation and choice regarding this drink.",

For two drinks I doubled and mixed all the ingredients for the seasoned tomato juice and split about 60% of it between two mugs that were filled with ice then I had the seasoned juice on the side for the next round!",
