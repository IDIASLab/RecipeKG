It\u2019s almost exactly the same except I use 3 cups confectioner sugar, 3 sticks of butter and 3 eggs and I mix for literally 20 minutes. I also use ready made pie crust most of the time. It\u2019s easier and I think it\u2019s just as good. I actually made this tonight but I cut the whole recipe in half because I don\u2019t need 2 of these pies sitting around. The only thing  I usually do different is I drain my crushed pineapple very well before I put it on top of my bananas. Even with them being drained and plotted with a paper  towel there still moist when eating the pie. I love this dessert and haven\u2019t come across to many people who didn\u2019t love it.",
