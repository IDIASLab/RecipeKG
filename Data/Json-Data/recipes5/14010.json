First, I used three ripe Jersey tomatoes, by far the best out there.  I used just one large green bell pepper, one medium sized sweet onion and one fresh jalepeno pepper.  I added more lemon juice to taste, and lots of fresh cilantro.  I also added kosher salt to taste.  The original recipe had too much green pepper and subsequently not enough tomato. It needed salt desperately, as it was very bland. Also, it tastes much better the next day, it needs to marinate. My family is enjoying it, and I plan to keep making it as long as there are Jersey tomatoes out there!\r\n\r\n",
