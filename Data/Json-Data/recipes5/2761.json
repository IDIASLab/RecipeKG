OLD AUNT. I WILL MAKE ANOTHER ONE AS SOON AS I FINISH BECAUSE I NEED MY \"FIX\" AFTER 3 1/2 YRS. OF NOT BEING ABLE TO BAKE IT! IT IS SO MOIST AND IMPROVES WITH AGE. I USE LEMON SUPREME CAKE MIX AND A BOX OF APRICOT JELLO MIX; I MIX THE JELLO (DRY) WITH MY CAKE MIX BEFORE ADDING THE OTHER INGREDIENTS. I ALSO USE ONE CUP OF WESSON OIL AND ONE CUP OF APRICOT NECTAR. I MIX MY GLAZE WITH APRICOT NECTAR AND LEMON JUICE; I POKE HOLES IN THE CAKE WHILE STILL IN THE PAN AND POUR HALF THE GLAZE ON THE CAKE WHILE STILL WARM; THEN I USE THE LAST HALF OF THE GLAZE TO DRIZZLE OVER THE CAKE AFTER IT IS REMOVED FROM THE PAN AND COOLED.
