I made one using 4 eggs, spoon of water, salt & pepper, mushroom pieces, Colby jack, and black Forrest ham. I lined the pan with foil and sprayed with butter spray. I put it on the middle shelf, turned the oven to the 350, and baked 5 minutes, flipping half way with an extra large spatula. I cut in half for 2 servings as in my picture. I will make this again trying a variety of fillings for a hot yet fast breakfast.",
