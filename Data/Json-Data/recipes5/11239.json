I use vegetarian ground beef instead of the 1/2 beef 1/2 sausage mix and pasta sauce on top instead of the tomato mixture to avoid it from becoming too soupy.  As long as you cover it in the oven, it doesn't dry out.  As others stated there are no seasonings in the recipe so i suggest browning the meat with some garlic and adding some basil and oregano to the filling.  I've had a lot of fun making it a little different each time I make it, but it's such a great base that it always turns out delicious.",

I of course made a few changes or else I don't think there would have been enough flavor for our taste (that's just how I roll). The biggest difference in how I prepared it is that I used a pound of ground beef/deer that was pre-cooked (I pre-cook about 6 lbs of it at a time portion it and freeze it to save time). I would think that preparing it raw like a meat loaf would leave a lot of grease behind but maybe that's just me. I added minced garlic a pinch of salt and pepper and Italian herbs to the mixture. I omitted the sausage since I didn't have any on hand and honestly there wouldn't have been room for it in the \"boats\". I also omitted the onions since my husband doesn't like them. I also added a pinch of sugar salt pepper garlic powder and Italian herbs to the tomato sauce and next time to save me time I'll just use jar speghetti sauce which will probably taste better anyways. I also added a ridiculous amount of mozzerella cheese 30 minutes into baking and baked it until bubbly (about 10-15 min. more). This is a fantastic way to use up zucchini when you have an overabundance of it in the garden! Thank you!",

Half way thru baking I sprinkled with parmesan and it turned out delicious. It's not a real quick meal but the results are well worth it. Another way to stuff the zuke would be to cut off the stem end and insert a filet knive cutting out the insides and a spoon for the very bottom it makes for a cool presentation.
