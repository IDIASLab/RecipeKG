This recipe does not indicate to drain and press the moisture from the tofu very well but I went ahead and did so (paper towel-lined plate under another paper towel w/ cast iron skillet on top replacing the soggy paper towels occasionally) to ensure maximum adherence of marinade. I baked mine as mentioned in cook's notes for closer to 30 min. to get them even crispier and I was delighted w/ the texture.",
