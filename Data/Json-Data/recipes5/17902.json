I doubled the brown sugar and the worcestershire and omitted the water. I used white wine vinegar instead of distilled because it's milder and only 1/2 cup of V8. Whenever I see ketchup in a marinade I always substitute chili sauce as a rule of thumb because it provides that little extra kick. I let the chicken marinate overnight and finished it on the grill. You can even baste it with a bit of your favorite BBQ sauce towards the end if you want it extra special.",

I have a 2 1/2 month old daughter and I am always trying to find something that can be cooked between feedings and/or during naps this is so easy to make and so tasty that I make it a lot. I have discoverd that if you put is in the crock pot for double the oven time it is so much nicer to shred and so tender too. Just put it in on high for 90 min then shred and put back for 30 min it takes longer but is so much better. My husband eats it just on the plate but I prefer to have it on a hoagie with sweet onion and cheddar cheese. I also make a \"Texas BBQ Chicken Quesedilla\" with it buy putting a tortilla down and putting mexican cheese mix that is already shredded it's by Kraft on half of the tortilla then chicken fallowed by onion top it off with more cheese and fold the tortilla over nuke it in the microwave until cheese is melted and VIOLA. I serve with either mashed potatos or french fries and baked beans.",
