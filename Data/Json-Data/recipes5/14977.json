I use this recipe quite often for church pot-luck meals because not only can I make it the night before (it is actually better made the night before so the flavors can combine), it goes well with any meat--ham, chicken, or roast and it makes a lot.

I liberally added garlic salt in the boiling water - this gives a little more flavor to the potatoes.  Again, I'm pleased to save some time away from the kitchen during a holiday.

I used more fresh chives added 1 clove of garic and baked them with cheddar cheese in the middle and on top. Put 1/2 the potatoes in the dish then add a THIN layer of cheese. Repeat with remaining potatoes and cheese. I did dot it with butter and added a few chives for decoration. These were good. I also made chicken gravy to go with them but they already had enough flavor. Even the boyfriend loved them!!! Definatly a keeper. Next time i will try the sour cream and cream cheese in plain potatoes. THEY ARE SO FLUFFY!!! THANKS FOR SHARING J.CARTER!",

Sprinkle a little garlic and onion powder and it tastes great!  Also, it says to cook for 30 minutes, however, after being refrigerated, it almost always takes 45-1 hour to get heated throughout when making a full baking dish.  Tastes best when allowed to sit in the refrigerater for 24 hours before cooking.",

This time I took a chance and made these. Boy was I glad I did. They taste delicious creamy and smooth. Only one person at the table even detected the slight \"tang\" of sour cream. Everyone loved them and thought they were my usual mashed potatoes. And I was one happy relaxed cook. Instead of chives I used the finely snipped ends of green onions (scallions ) in the same quantity. When you've got a huge multi-dish dinner going on this recipe can be a real life-saver.",
