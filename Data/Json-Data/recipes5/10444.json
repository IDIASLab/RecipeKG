While the breading seems very plain, the browned butter does give it a good flavor, though we did add a little dried parsley to the breading.

Doubling the fish and cutting the amount of flour in half (leaving the peppers full amount, but reducing the salt) still left us with enough for another day (frozen in a zip-top bag).",
