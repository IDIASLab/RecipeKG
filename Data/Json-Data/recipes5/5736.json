Additional vegetables can also be added which is a plus. I agree with the previous reviewer that the lemon flavor was weak so I also added more lemon juice and brushed the chicken with lemon juice while grilling. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. A good picnic salad. Thanks!",

I think this pasta salad is a bit lacking in seasoning so I did add some pepper and a little more garlic salt. If you're looking for a bold pasta salad this isn't for you as the flavor is mild and mellow. I'm not the world's biggest pasta salad person but I do enjoy one occasionally. This made a nice dinner along with a fresh fruit salad and hot bread. Thanks philly6288 for sharing.",

I used olive oil and found I needed to add more after I'd tossed in the pasta and chicken along with more garlic salt and pepper. I like the idea of using arugula and will try that next time as the spinach leaves seemed a bit unwieldly (and a 10 oz bag is way too much. I used maybe 3 oz.). In the interest of time I also cheated and used pre-cooked and sliced seasoned Italian chicken strips.",
