Also I had 3 trout to make and it did not seem as if the ingredient measurements adjusted properly as the spices/herbs did not make a paste so much as a thick syrup. Too much lemon juice? Therefore the sauce did not stay on the fish very well. It was still tasty (it's trout for goodness sake!) but really could not taste the flavoring that much. So may give this one another try as I think most of the problem was user error.:-)",
