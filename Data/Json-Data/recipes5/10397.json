It's meant to have a strong peanut taste and if you don't like that you should be looking for another recipe. I love the sauce just as written. It gives the wings a lot of meatiness that they normally don't have. I've made these for regular dinners parties and functions and they've always been a huge hit! When I put them alongside more traditional wings this is always the plate that runs out first. The only thing I change is that after a lot of experimenting I've found 30 minutes of initial cooking (turning half-way through) and then 5 minutes afterward gives me a much juicer product.",

I made the sauce first and wound up doubling everything but the PB or I would have thrown it out. Depending on your love of peanut butter I would half the measurement or add to taste. The Jalapeno jelly is actually sweet and slightly spicy not hot at all. I added extra Sriracha because my family loves hot wings. I didnt have fish sauce. I looked on the internet and used 1Tbls Soy sauce and 1Tbls lime juice as a substitute. In the end this was pretty good and the kids got a kick out of eating PB & J wings. I'll probably make it again but without peanut butter.",
