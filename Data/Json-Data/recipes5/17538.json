Overnight would be overkill and probably just about disintegrate the meat! Make sure you do use fresh lemon juice as it imparts nice fresh flavor. One point to note: browning the chicken takes nowhere near 15 minutes - about 5 minutes is right. Adding the lemon slice & parsley is great too. I've made this twice now; once with the brown sugar (only about 1 tsp. for 3 breasts though) & once without. I don't really notice a big difference but I guess it adds a nice touch. The sauce at the end is also very good over rice.",

First of all i did not marinate overnight but rather placed the frozen chicken in the ziplock and let it thaw in the marinade. I took the chicken out mid afternoon. I browned it as per the direstions but then added the brown sugar to the stock rather than sprinkling it on top. I DID NOT reuse any of the marinade in the sauce cause thats just gross! Instead i added a tbsp. of lemon juice. I cooked it uncovered so the sauce would reduce and it ended up coming out perfectly. It thickened nicely and looked delicious. I cant even describe how much my family loved this and have been told i need to make this ALOT!",
