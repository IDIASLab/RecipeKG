I made a few additions: since our garden is giving with abundance, I added 2 large, ripe tomatoes cut up with the cucumber, and a small bunch of fresh chives-finely cut up (about 1-2 Tbsp) then marinated the 2 hrs as the recipe stated. Poured off the marinate solution, and followed this recipe except used 2 green onions equaling 2 Tbsp instead of 3 Tbsp. I shall use this recipe often!!! Thank you---we really loved it!!",

I will try this recipe and hopefully it will be just like his or close to it.
