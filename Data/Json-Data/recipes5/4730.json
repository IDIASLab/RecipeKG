Using Greek seasoning however was not something I've used often and I enjoyed it. Can't beat a dish that requires such little clean-up is SO good for you and so flavorful. Other than using grouper instead of halibut (any mild flavored white fish would work) I made this with the ingredients as directed just winging it with measurements. While I did miss the golden color that comes from grilling roasting or sauteing I was nevertheless very pleased with this and since this calls for ingredients I always have in my kitchen it's something I plan to treat myself to frequently.",

I used half an onion rather than whole and sauteed the onions and olives in about 3 or 4 Tbsp olive oil on medium heat until onions were mellow and brown. Added a basil leaf and some chopped fresh lemon thyme because I had some from the farmers' market and have no idea what to do with it. I also added about a teaspoon of dried oregano. I added three cloves smashed garlic the chopped tomato one can artichoke hearts chopped capers and about 2 Tbsp tomato paste - again because I had some sitting in the fridge. Covered the whole deal and simmered on the stovetop stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes more. I greased a pyrex pan generously with olive oil placed the halibut in rubbed with salt and pepper and poured the lemon juice directly on the fish and then poured the pan sautee mixture over everything and baked until done. Served over sauteed spinach with a side of rice. Yum.",
