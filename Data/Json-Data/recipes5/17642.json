WHen we cooked the chicken the marinade was delicious but the chicken became barely edible in the end since our mouths were on fire. When we left the habanero out of the marinade recipe the chicken was nice and tender flavorful and FAR less spicy. So this marinade is quite good but i recommend a limited amount of habanero.",

The combination of ingredients sounded odd to me... all that curry with beer and bourbon and hot sauce and red pepper flakes... I thought \"What a strange brew this is gonna be!\" But just follow this one to the letter and you cannot go wrong. Thanks for submitting such a GREAT recipe! I'll be trying it with chicken pork and shrimp in the days to come. I'll bet it's good with anything!",
