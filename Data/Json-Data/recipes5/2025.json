If you want to cut it....just mix everything.....and I mean everything including the melted butter.......together well.  This makes it able to be cut into squares.  I personally like the original way better ....but it is nice to know in case you want to be able to cut it and serce it with more fresh fruit/ilce cream/whipped cream....on top.  I would be interested to hear if anyone else has made it this way.",
