My changes--an extra slice of bacon white onion instead of red (didn't have any red) 1 bunch of collards (didn't measure it in cups) chicken broth instead of water no red pepper flakes and pintos instead of cannellini beans. Some of the changes had more effect than others I'm sure. I used what I had. Oh and one other thing--while the greens were simmering I tossed some raw sweet italian sausages in to cook on top. Served with very basic biscuits--the biscuits were yummy with the pot liquor. Anyway given that we're not working with our favorite ingredient and the recipe was still yummy even with all the things I had to do to fit what I had I rate this five stars. Very good.",
