When I came across this recipe I decided to go for it as I happened to have all the ingrediants called for. I almost thought it was a mistake when it called for the ingrediants to be put into an already baked pie crust and baked again but it's not. It got RAVE reviews and is simple as well pie! I suggest that you try this recipe AS IS before fooling with it...it TRULY beggs for some rum extract I think but a FABULOUS and impressive pie all on it's own. Am making three for a funeral dinner tomorrow. P.S. If you have brown sugar use it. This is the one of few recipes I've made that I really believe would be noteably downgraded by a substitute. FABULOUS. This is going to be one of my new favorites to make and take. One you can really be proud of.",
