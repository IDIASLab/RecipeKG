We thought this was good but when it came to the leftovers there were no takers. We use that as a hallmark of a recipe. I love all the ingredients but for some reason they seemed like they'd do better with chicken tenders rather than pork tenderloin--and maybe they were just a little dry. I appreciate the recipe and would try it again with a little sauce over the top made with lemon juice and butter.",
