I made a bit more than the recipe called for: 6 avocados 3 finely diced pears 1 finely diced small onion about 2 cups of green grapes that I quartered because they were huge the seeds from 1 pomegranate the juice from 1 large lime and two de-seeded serrano peppers. I had no idea how many seeds one pomegranate produces but found just 1 to be plenty for my liking. And I'd be careful with the serrano peppers unless you know you like things hot. I only used two (and de-seeded them as well) to make sure my spice intolerant family members will actually be able to eat it. I can't wait to bring it to our Christmas festivities!",
