I'd recommend that you double the marinade because the sauce is so good, you'll want more!----UPDATE 6.17.13------Here's another reason to make enough for leftovers.  I always make extra marinade for extra sauce.  I had some leftover pork from a dinner two days ago, so I heated the leftover marinade, shredded the leftover pork, and added it to the marinade, warming briefly.  Use this as a filling for a flour tortilla burrito, topping with shredded cabbage and carrots, and fold up burrito style.  My husband loved this!!",
