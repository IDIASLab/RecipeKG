It turned out a little sticky but the taste was great and it was even better the next day. Next time I'm going to cook the rice and lentils separately so the rice won't be so sticky and I will double the lentils to make it a more substantial main dish. Excellent recipe; thanks!",

It's important to use lots of fresh lemon (add the zest too for brightness of flavor) and be sure to add it last. Use a food processor to chop the carrots and beans--not just because it's easiest but also because it chops the vegetables to the perfect texture. Add red pepper flakes or a pinch of ground ginger if you'd like some heat. This is a tasty healthy side perfect for pairing with any fish or chicken dish with citrus notes.",
