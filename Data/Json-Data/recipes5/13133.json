I make it for my coworkers for Christmas and always get requests for the recipe.  What's nice about it is you can vary the proportion of snacks that are in...more oyster crackers, less pretzels, etc. For reference, it makes probably 2 plastic gallon bags' worth of mix. This also freezes well to stay fresh longer.",

The one thing I didn't care for was that the savory snack mix with toasted cereal (such as Chex Mix) is already seasoned so they got a double dose. Next time I'll toss them in at the end after the other stuff has absorbed the homemade seasoning. This is fairly expensive to make but it makes a ton!",
