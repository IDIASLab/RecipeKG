Just the right amount of sweet and tangy flavor. I also didn't have enough pork chops so I added in some pork tenderloin instead which I think soaked in the flavor a lot better than the chops. If you plan on air frying this, which I did - it's 280F (140C) for 5 mins on each side for the thinner cuts (tenderloin) and 320F (160C) for 6 mins on each side for the thicker cuts (chops).",
