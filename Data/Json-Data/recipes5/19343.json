I cut the recipe in half to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised. Along with the pineapple I added some sliced strawberries and blueberries I had on hand. This was a great way to use cottage cheese and it has a nice crunch from the granola complimented by the sweetness of fresh fruit. Very easy and very tasty!",

I did sub strawberries for the pineapple one- because I had them and two- because I'm not real big on pineapple and cottage cheese together. This was a great filling breakfast. I would make them again the same way. I feel you could omit the brown sugar and it will be just as good. Thanks Katie for a new breakfast idea.",
