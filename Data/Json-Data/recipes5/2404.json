It\u2019s cut into 1/2-inch strips, and when checked after 7 minutes, it was done (I checked with a meat thermometer). They were crispy golden brown and there was no need to put them under the broiler. The breading is very tasty, the cooking time just needs to be adjusted, and I think you\u2019ll be happy (we were). Served this evening with honey mustard dipping sauce, and they were a hit!   As a side note, this recipe could be easily adapted to an air fryer.   Thanks for sharing your recipe, I will make this again.",

I dredged in seasoned flour before dipping in egg, then seasoned panko\n\nI used the oven at 420 because I put it on parchment paper, but then realized I had to move them to aluminum foil if I wanted to use the broiler, so next time I'll just use aluminum foil. \n\nI though the timing was perfect.
