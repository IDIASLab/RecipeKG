It was AMAZING! The only change I made is that I used 2 avocados instead of 3, and I used fresh pico that you can buy in the produce section which has tomato and onion all chopped up nicely and mixed that in I also used lime juice which gave it a nice flavor and helped it last  when we had it for lunch again the following day.
