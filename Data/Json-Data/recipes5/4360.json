I followed directions EXCEPT I used marinate artichokes! Guess what VERY GOOD but not perfect as I imagine the recipe should and could have been. I used 26 ounces of drained marinated artichoke hearts and the result was very good. It would have been FANTASTIC if I had compensated for the marinated artichokes by eliminating the white wine and lemon juice due to the marinade! This is a great recipe; just make sure you follow the directions and as the first reviewer suggested you may want to reduce the artichokes by half but if you LOVE THOSE ARTICHOKES... go for it! Thank you for a great recipe!",

Since it did not specify marinated I bought simple canned artichoke hearts. In Step 5 there is absolutely no way all these solid ingredients with so little liquid will produce something that will boil. It turned out as a big dry glob I could saut\u00e9 for a bit and then add to the broth. The final product was one unsatisfying meal.",
