I did get a bit nervous when the quinoa took longer to cook than I'm used to, but it came out perfect! I too added a can of rinsed and drained black beans. Of course to make it unhealthy, I added a small dollop of sour cream and a teaspoon of shredded cheddar cheese to mine. I doubt the bf will touch it (he's weary of quinoa), but perhaps if I drown his in cheese and sour cream, he just might touch it. Thanks for the recipe!",

After a few minutes a added a full cup of salsa (didn't have the Rotel) also didn't have the taco seasoning but used 2tsp. of cumin...cook as directed. Once it was done I topped with a large amount of fresh cilantro and diced green onions. It's great as a side dish this way...if you want a main dish add a protein (chicken and black beans or?) top with melted cheese or add it all together in a burrito. It's also great with diced avocado/sour cream on top. Thanks so much for this recipe I made a huge batch!",
