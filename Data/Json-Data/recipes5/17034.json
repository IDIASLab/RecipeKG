I served it on a meat and cheese platter with little slices of party rye. Everyone was amazed that we had made our own summer sausage.Thanks P Bautsch!",

Also I cooked at 170 for 4 hours and it was browning nicely but still pretty raw in the middle so I bumped up the temp to 250 for another hour. I looked for other recipes to compare cooking temps b/c the 150 worried me a bit since it's ground meat. Most of the other recipes out there that cook at 150 had a cooking time of 6-8 hours which sounds about right.",

For the wild game you must add fat but I won't go there and just rate this as made with beef. Honestly there is no need for MSG. We never use that and it is not necessary. What you do need to use it its place if you want the sausage to solidify like what you buy at the store is curing salt. This is a must. While you can hand roll it I recommend buying a cheap package of casings to stuff it in. Do not skip the overnight in the fridge step (recipe says 24 hours but overnight works just fine) because it needs this. When you think store bought summer sausage you imagine that bright deep red/pinkish color right? Curing salt. I cannot stress enough how you need to switch out the MSG for curing salt. I'm sure curing sugar would work too but I don't know for sure. By using the curing salt all three meats turned out excellent and looked professional when sliced. For the venison and duck we opted to ditch the liquid smoke and smoke them in out smoker instead. This was even better. But if you don't have a smoker the oven works fine too. Good recipe if you lose the MSG and add curing salt instead!",
