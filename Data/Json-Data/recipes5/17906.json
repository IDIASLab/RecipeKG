The geletin when placed in ice water turned into a rubber disk. Stupid me tried to cut it into pieces and mix it into the batter. I had a total mess. I was about to throw it away when my husband said don't throw it away I want some of that batter. So i thought what would happen if i heated the whole batch of batter? Would the geletin globs melt? Well they did! I had used peanut butter and milk chocolate chips (out of cinn) on top I put chopped peanut butter white choc milk choc and crushed pecans. Let me tell you this pie was WONDERFUL. The whole point of the geletin is to cut the over rich cream cheesyness. I will try is with lime and several other cream cheese pies.",
