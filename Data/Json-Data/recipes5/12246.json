Next time I ll probably cut the cream back a little and bake a bit longer as well. But on the positive side it s DELICIOUS and it s screaming for its spot on the Thanksgiving dinner table. Many layers of different flavors distributed throughout this creamy gratin but the sweet potato-gruyere-fresh herb partnership is almost magical. I used my mandolin to slice the potatoes clipped the fresh herbs from the pots on my porch and bought my shredded gruyere cheese at Aldi (they carry it all the time not seasonal and it s inexpensive). Honestly this was pretty darn easy to make and I wouldn t hesitate to serve this to company. Thank you Sandy Wilson Wickberg for sharing your recipe we thoroughly enjoyed it!",
