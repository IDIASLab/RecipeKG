I used chicken broth instead of water, added a dash of cajun seasoning, worcestershire and a bit of parsley and tomato paste (to give it some color). When the whole thing was cooked I thickened it a bit more with some cornstarch in white wine (gave it a nice finished touch) I ended up with a traditional tasting true New Orleans style Shrimp toufee.

I was astonished! this tasted perfect. this will be a regular for me.
