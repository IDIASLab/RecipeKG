Any extra dough and scraps were rolled out, left to rise, fried, and sprinkled with sugar to create a simple, but delicious donut-like treat.\u00a0Here we're doing a savory twist, using the same technique to make a pizza featuring ricotta, pancetta, and peaches. Garnish with extra sprig of thyme if desired.",

Those Ewws quickly became Wows when I brought these to the table however. Every last one has always been eaten. I've made them without the Parmesan or Romano when I didn't have any on hand and they were just as good I think. I've made them with prosciutto instead of pancetta and they were still good. I've added some of the following spices: cinnamon mace nutmeg allspice cardamom and ginger. All good. I've added pinches of crystallized ginger. Equally good. It all depends on what you like. The black pepper ricotta peaches and dough are all obviously essential ingredients but go with what you personally like as embellishments - you will not be disappointed. For me cardamom is essential.",
