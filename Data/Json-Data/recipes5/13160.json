It turned out but it's more like a heavy biscuit dough despite two different leavening agents or perhaps because of them but I suspect the problem is the oil. I expect flakiness from empanada dough. The filling is just meh, certainly not the bang I would expect for the time involved which is NOT a prep time of 35 minutes unless you wield a Gordon Ramsey professional cutting speed which I do not. Was it edible? Yes, which is why it gets two stars rather than one. Would I make it again? No. Also, I saw 5 stars when I decided to make it without checking the amount of reviews (1). Caveat emptor, I won't make that mistake again.",
