They take minutes to whisk together, there's absolutely no culinary finesse required, and the combinations of oils, vinegar, and flavorings are limitless. How about balsamic vinaigrette on some grilled skirt steak? Maybe mustard dressing on some pork chops? How could grilled chicken drizzled with Greek dressing and feta cheese not be awesome?",

I did use a meat thermometer to make sure the internal temp hit 130 degrees before removing from grill. If I had to guess when these were done I would have ruined it as I was thinking they were ready way before they actually hit it. I know we will be making this one again.",
