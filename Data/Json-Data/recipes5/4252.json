I might also add some oatmeal or rice to make it a little thicker. I had a really difficult time with the burgers sticking together; they just fell apart. I like the idea of using tahini and almonds though. I felt like the almonds gave it a nice texture (and I'm REALLY big on texture). This is at least worth experimenting with.",

I think they just need to be heated and crisped on the one side a bit. But these are on the regular rotation in our house- everyone enjoyed the flavor and texture. I may suggest switching the soy sauce to light for less saltiness or even tamarind sauce for the flavour but I enjoy it with regular or tamarind just fine.",

Assuming you aren't intolerant add a few tablespoons of vital wheat gluten to the mix. It helps glue the burgers together and adds some protein. (Tossing all your ingredients into the food processor also makes the chunks small enough to pack tightly) Replace some of the soy sauce/tamari with water to cut the salt and keep the mix moist enough to hold together.",
