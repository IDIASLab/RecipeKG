I would like to try to figure out a way to make more,  Hogs just don't have a lot of fat on them these days.  I am married to a farmer.  I left out the cayenne because the farmer can't take spice, but I bet it's awesome with it.  Next time i would probably add more fat to possibly double in the end?  i had to add water a couple of times during the browning of the ham by the way. I just used a slice of ham which might be part of the lack of fat problem.  Anyway it was worth it and i will do it every time I make a slice of ham or a whole ham. Just amazing. Even Farmer Brown liked it and his palette is plain, lol   Thank you so much for sharing!",

May need to rinse if too salty AFTER cooking. Real country ham doesn\u2019t take long to cook at all. That being said, I personally use bacon drippings to start with, in order to have grease at the end. Ham will flavor bacon fat.Cook ham in bacon grease and pour grease into bowl afterwards. Pour strong black coffee into the iron skillet, I hope you are using. Reduce and sometimes I add a pinch of brown sugar. Pour into bowl, and pour reserved grease in that. Grease will float to the top, this the name red eye. Over CRISP biscuits are my favorite.",
