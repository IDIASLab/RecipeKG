        "description": "I grew up on these delicious, sweet, and tangy barbecue sandwiches made from chipped deli ham. This dish is a  staple in Western Pennsylvania, although each family seems to have its own way of making them! It's a terrific last-minute meal. Chipped chopped ham is a pressed ham loaf sold at deli counters in the Pittsburgh area which is always chipped. If you can get Islay's Chipped Ham, that is the original and still the best for these sandwiches. Otherwise, just get any deli ham and have it chipped or shaved paper thin. Enjoy!",

Also, its very important to use Isleys chopped or \"chipped\" ham, if your region sells it. The ham makes this sandwich! My mothers recipe is quite different though, she uses the onion and butter, 1 bottle of Heinz chili sauce, fill the chili bottle with water, 1 tablespoon of vinegar and a 1 tablespoon of sugar. So the only reason I gave it this rating was because of the thickness, was hoping for a thinner sauce.",
