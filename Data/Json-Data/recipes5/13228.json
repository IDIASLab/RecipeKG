Served over spaghetti, so I was longing for a little more sauce, so next time, I\u2019ll probably just serve the pasta as a side dish with olive oil, salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  This is easy enough for a weeknight dinner, but I\u2019d serve to company, as well.  Served with a caesar salad and toasted garlic bread.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
