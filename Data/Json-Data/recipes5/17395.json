I wouldn't eat this dish without 'Breyers Natural Vanilla' ice cream because it's very sweet and rich but in a good way. Unless you have quite a few people to feed, you shouldn't need to double the recipe either.\n\nI've never seen anyone use melted butter to make crisp but I would recommend using hard butter from the fridge and mashing it with a fork into the dry ingredients. It should be a crumbly texture sprinkled onto the cherries. If the topping gets creamy and has the consistency of cake batter, it will stay that way when cooked and you won't get the desired 'crispy' consistency of the topping.",

Yes, it kind of tastes like a \"store bought\" one, but hey - it takes 15 minutes to prep and you are using canned cherries (or other filling).  Per other suggestion, I doubled the crisp part of the recipe.  When I was making it, I thought double crisp looked wierd, but when we tasted it - awesome!  However, the can of cherry filling I had in the cupboard didn't have enough for what I like.  So, I ended up adding about a layer of mixed frozen berries on top of the cherry filling and patting them down into the filling goo.  Adding the frozen berries was a good idea; it cut down on the \"canned\" feeling of the crisp.  Omitted nutmeg, used real butter, sub'd walnuts for pecans.",
