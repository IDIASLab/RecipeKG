As soon as it left the pan and hit the cake it 'set' so I had to 'pat' it on in chunks. The second time I beat it 1 1/2 minutes: it poured down my Pumpkin bundt cake and set very nicely in a thick glaze. Don't be fooled by the liquid/honey consistancy: it will start to set as soon as it leaves the hot pan. The only reason I gave it four stars not five is that it cracked and crumbled when the cake was cut. It was easy and very VERY yummy.... I'll make it again I'm just not to sure for what!",

Since I noticed that people had said that it got a little hard I added about 1 tsp extra butter when I made it. It was perfect! Just the right consistency after it set up on the cake. It seemed really gooey when I first put it on and I thought \"Oh well caramel sauce is really good.\" But after a few hours it had set up just perfect. I can't keep my hands off of it! Great flavor great consistency great amount for a topping. Definitely a keeper! I skipped the nuts also mostly out of economics.",
