I used a package of Costco organic chicken breasts that I cut in half horizontally and did not pound out.  I cut the other ingredients in half, and they were just right.  I used panko crumbs, and I used 2 tablespoons of Grand Marnier on top.  I do think that 25 minutes at 350 would be too much for what I made, so if the chicken were to be pounded out to 1/4 inch, I wouldn't want to bake it for that long.  As it was, I baked mine for about 15 minutes at 350.  We will definitely have this again, and I'd serve it for company any time!  Thanks, NANNYMM!",

I never change anything the first time that I make it & I can not see that I will make any changes. It is outstanding as is!\nOne lady complained that it mentioned the wine twice, the #1 was to make the wine sauce & #2 was to tell you when to add the sauce...both times were necessary! The other complaint was that it did not say when to place the lemon slices on the chicken nor when to add the lemon juice.  You add the lemon slices after you salt & pepper the chicken in the baking dish & it tells you to add the lemon juice & broth simultaneously after scraping up the bits & pieces.\nI'm 80 years old & my daddy & \"Mama\", my grandmother taught me to cook. The first thing they taught me was  \"if\nusing a recipe, take the time to read ALL of it slowly, then make sure that you have everything on hand, take your time, always follow the recipe the first time.\" I would like to add that food should always be prepared with love, many people are so into fast food that they think cooking should be as fast as fast food. NOT SO! There are recipes can can be rushed but never do a recipe as excellent as this one without taking the to do it right! My thanks to NannyMM & her mother for this excellent dish!  Margo",

I was too lazy to pound the chicken, cutting the breasts in halves instead. The orange liqueur added another dimension I didn't expect. I forgot the lemons, but I'm sure they would have boosted the flavor even more. I served this with risotto on the side. I would be proud to serve this to company! Thank you for a terrific recipe!",

After draining the milk, I toss the chicken in the crumb mix and I fry the chicken briefly on each side, then add to a greased dish. I top each piece with a thin slice of lemon and prepare the sauce. I leave a small amount of oil in the pan, to which I add 1 c wine, 1 c chicken broth and 1/4 c lemon juice. I bring this to a boil and reduce it by about half. I add the sauce to the dish and bake for 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees.",
