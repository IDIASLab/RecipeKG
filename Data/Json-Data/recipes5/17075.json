It reminds me a little of Cuban food.\r\nSome of the reviews said this was too sweet. My guess is it was their stewed tomatoes. This was not a real sweet dish with PLAIN DICED CANNED TOMATOES(instead of stewed)like I used. The idea of adding onion (esp. RED onion)sounds, to me, like it would be great; but I don't think mushrooms would work with this(and I love mushrooms). I think, a mix of sliced red onion,and red, yellow and green peppers (in the last 15 min.) steamed in the sauce, would compliment this sauce better; although the recipe is perfect just  AS IT IS.\r\nI made with white rice and stir-fried, garlicky, fresh-cracked peppered green beans to make a meal. Although, any starch (noodles, rice etc.) and any green vegetable would be excellent with it. \r\nIt made about a cup of sauce with flavorful chunks of tomato that we spooned over the chicken and rice. I made only four breasts, so I will double sauce for more servings. 'Gotta' have enough of the sauce to add to the rice!\r\nNancy, you said your husband hasn't gotten sick of this in 15 years... mine liked it a lot too. I have a feeling I will be making for the next 15 years, also. Thank you so much for sharing this one!",

I scaled it to three using the exact measurements provided when scaled down.  As a preference I used canned diced tomatoes, chicken broth (had it left over in the frig - water would have been fine), cayenne pepper since I didn't have hot pepper sauce.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and added a small onion sliced into rings - I would never leave that out now. Also had some leftover corn in the frig which I threw in at the end.  I pounded the breasts so they would be the same thickness, cooked them in 25 min. and they were incredibly moist.  Keep an eye on it when it simmers - I did have to add some more broth which was fine - it held its rich, spicy flavor and was great over the rice. Another keeper.  Thanks Nancy.",

I reduced the chili powder to 1/2 the amount, used 1/2 the amount of water so that I could do the other half in WHITE WINE; the wine really made the recipe as we've since used it and forgotten the wine, and could tell the difference. An extra splash of Frank's Red Hot Sauce doesn't hurt either! I love the combination of flavors and using all of the somewhat unusual-together ingredients to get there. The meat is tender, moist, and flavorful. SO good! A definite keeper. Thanks, Nancy!",
