I made one batch of chocolate caramel corn and then made a second batch of just caramel and almonds. I mixed the two together and it turned out great. I also cooked the popcorn for about 50 minutes and it seemed to make my second batch a little crunchier...I'm sure it helped that it only had one coating instead of two. Also had trouble with the popcorn sticking to the waxed paper. I used cooking spray on the second batch and it was better. Just made one more batch (easy Christmas gifts!) and used aluminum foil with a little cooking spray to let the popcorn cool. No sticking...yeah! So ditch the waxed paper and save yourself alot of time.",
