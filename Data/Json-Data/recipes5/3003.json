There just didn't seem to be enough seasoning so I needed to add quite a bit more. I also used half spinach and half broccoli with the spinach adding a bit more taste. I did as others mentioned and put in the parmesean cheese last which created a creamy mixture. All my vegetables were fresh except for the broccoli. I'd suggest this recipe to anyone who doesn't mind swaying from the recipe in order to make a really tasty dish. My boyfriend loved it especially with the extra garlic powder I added.",

Too much black pepper add 1/2-1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes instead. I like more lemon too and increased the amount of juice to my liking and microplaned a bit of zest in there as well. If you use salted butter you may not need an entire TB of salt. A splash of half & half was a great addition too. Next time will add chicken or shrimp for the meat lovers in my family. I give it 1 star as written but a 4 with the tweaks.:-)",
