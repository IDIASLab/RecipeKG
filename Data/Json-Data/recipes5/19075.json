Tastes much more like ketchup, and less like a sweet tomato based dipping sauce.\n_______________________________________\nFANTASTIC alternative to store bought ketchups!  The add in/customization possibilities are endless as well.  I think store bought ketchup is nasty, but I WILL use this.  I did find this recipe a bit too sweet, but that's no skin off my back.  I'll just use it to make BBQ sauce, and make another batch with only 3 tb of brown sugar.",

But I think store bought ketchup is disgusting and wanted something homemade. This was PERFECT! It was the perfect base so all I had to do was add my secret ingredients. It made my sauce taste even better than it already did. I'm going to use this as a regular ketchup as well. A little tip; Instead of letting it cook for just an hour I put it in my small crockpot and let it sit on low all day. YUM! Thank you for this GREAT recipe! :)",

So, although my family was skeptical, I went to AR to find a recipe.  Let me tell you something: I'm never going to buy ketchup ever again.  This recipe is fantastic.  I didn't even follow it exactly and it turned out fantastic!  I didn't have tomato paste so I used a 4-oz can of tomato sauce, and omitted the water; also I had no onion powder or syrup, so I didn't use them.  I really wanted to eat right away so I skipped the simmering part, although that made it more liquid than regular ketchup it tasted perfect anyway.  My family was stunned.

Definitely cheaper and better than the store-bought stuff I'll never be buying again.  Next time I will cut the brown sugar amount in half, though, use less salt, and only use 3/4 cup of water (adding the extra 1/2 cup just increases the cooking time, because you reduce it right back out.)  Thanks for an easy, easily customizable recipe!  EDIT: made again with allspice as indicated, and IT'S WAY BETTER. Don't skip it if you don't have to.  Cut the brown sugar to 1 tbsp second time (we all thought it was way too sweet), which I liked better also.  That's just preference though.  Using only 3/4 cup water, I only had to simmer for 5ish minutes. Score!",
