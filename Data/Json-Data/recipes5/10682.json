One key to this simple combination is letting it chill in the fridge for a few hours to marry all the flavors. You can substitute parsley or basil for the mint, but I beg you to try it with the mint. There is something about the taste of fava beans that the mint really brings out like no other herb.",

I heated a couple small cloves with the skin still on in a small pan over medium heat for 6 minutes until the garlic was slightly colored and soft. I added about 1/2 tsp salt but it wasn't enough. Unfortunately I brought this salad to a picnic so I couldn't adjust the seasoning later. I would make this again - trying different herbs This time I made it with mint.",
