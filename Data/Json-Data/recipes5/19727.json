Besides when using soy sauce I always try not to use the exact amount since to much soy sauce is to salty.  Did use the right amount of the other ingredients.  I was able to marinate 6 chops. Instead of grilling chops I browned them on the stove top and poured in the remaining marinate.  Let them simmer until the marinate became a glaze.  They were delicious.

I started with just 4 tbsp. of brown sugar and I added about 1 tbsp. of minced garlic.  I tasted the marinade before adding the pork and found it plenty sweet with just the 4tbs of brown sugar.  I only marinated the pork for about and 1 in the fridge I took the meat out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter for about 20 min.  It was too cold to grill so I used my grill pan the get the grill marks and then put the meat in a 350 degree oven for about 12-15 min and it turned out great. Will make this again.",
