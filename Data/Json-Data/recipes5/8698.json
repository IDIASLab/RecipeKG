Dill used sparingly is really nice, but if used excessively, it defeats the purpose. I would recommend to experiment with no more than 3/4 tsp of dried dill then adjust to taste. I also highly recommend using a bit more mushrooms like someone suggested. My personal touch was precisely when sauteeing the mushrooms. I added a splash of white wine and also sauteed them first before adding the onion and lastly the garlic to prevent burning of it. I served this over penne pasta and the presentation was restaurant worthy. Served with crusty bread and it was excellent for cleaning up remnant sauce.",
