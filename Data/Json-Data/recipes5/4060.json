I would've given this recipe 5-stars, if not for the over-bearing cinnamon taste that put-off both my husband and 3-year old, so next time, I will scale it back to 1/4, if not, 1/8 tsp. The only thing that I changed was using way less than the 5 TB olive oil called for. Overall a very exotic and yummy way to prepare carrots! I served it w/ 2 recipes from here -- \"Brilliant Sauteed Broccoli\" & \"Roasted Pork Chops with Mushrooms, Tomatoes, and Garlic Sauce\" and the result was a vibrant, colorful plate of complimentary flavors.",
