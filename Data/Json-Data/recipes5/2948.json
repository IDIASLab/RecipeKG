You should definitely make some changes to it, but once you find your perfect combination, you'll be extremely satisfied.  First alteration I made was halving the cream cheese.  Second, I halfed the mayo and added a little sour cream.  You will definitely want to do something with the artichokes if you don't purchase marinated ones, or even if you do.  I chopped mine up some more after they were drained and seasoned them with two kinds of seasoned salt, onion and garlic powder, a little black pepper, a small dash of italian seasoning and a couple of drops of hot sauce (I'm from Louisiana....We put that sh** on everything!  Lol).  I also mixed a little garlic powder with the spinach after it was drained.  Didn't use garlic cloves however next time, I will use only a couple and they'll be diced.  Make sure you grease your dish with a non-stick cooking spray as well as a little Country Crock and you'll have one of the best spinach dips you've ever tasted.",

I took the advice of others and used only 1 block cr.cheese, 1 jar marinated artichokes(cut up),1 box spinach, 1/2 cup mayo, 1/3 cup sour cream and shredded parmesan cheese. Save a couple tsps of the artichoke marinade and add to dip, too. I serve it w/blue corn chips.  Everyone has loved this dip and wanted the recipe. I even make it the day before my party and refrigerate. Then I bake it for about 40 mins if it's coming from the frig. This recipe is a winner for sure!! No fail!!",

The only changes I made (on the advice of other reviewers) was only using 1 tbsp lemon juice, marinated artichokes, 8 oz cream cheese, 8 oz sour cream. I chose to use the reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. I also used the shredded parmesan, romano, & asiago cheese instead of just parmesan, added a small jar of diced pimentos and 1 extra garlic clove. Everyone loved it!, even if it was reduced fat. Thanks for the great recipe.",

The dip was excellent but was VERY strong tasting. Next time I will omit the garlic and lemon altogether since the marinated items are so flavorful. NOTE: You should chop your artichokes and spinach very well which makes it a very messy process but worth the effort! If the dip becomes dry (which mine did) just blend in some sour cream.

I followed the recipe mostly--but since I tend to like things with lots of garlic and a bit spicy-hot I added an extra clove of garlic and some red pepper flakes. I was also pleased with how easy this recipe was to make; I had never made a dip like this and was extremely pleased at how simple it was. My only warnings are: (1) unless you are taking this to a large gathering you may want to half it because it makes a ton of dip! (2) even though you may purchase chopped spinach--chop it again to avoid large pieces. The brand I bought said chopped on the package but there were many whole pieces included.",
