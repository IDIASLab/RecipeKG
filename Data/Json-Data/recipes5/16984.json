Though the recipe calls for one vanilla pudding mix and one butterscotch pudding mix, I've never used the butterscotch (since I never have any in the cupboard!). Instead, I've used two vanilla mixes or one vanilla and one chocolate mix. Either way, the cake has always turned out great. Also, for a little extra flavor dimension, I've added a couple tablespoons of espresso or instant coffee to the water. The addition of coffee gives the cake a nice, subtle bite--and makes it into a true 'coffee cake.'\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a moist, yummy recipe that my family members always ask for. And because it's so easy to make, this would be a great cake for beginning bakers. Thank you, Janis, for your tasty submission!\r\n",

This literally takes 5 minutes to throw together and then you've got an entire family excited you made something so pretty (submitted pic).  For optional icing/toping, I put 1/2C powdered sugar and 1T of milk in a ziplock bag, cut off corner, and pour over.  Looks real pretty and it's only enough to zig zag over.  DEFINITELY take the advice of using Duncan Hines cake mix (white or yellow) or one that doesn't already have pudding in it.  My oven is fast, and I still had to bake for 45 min at 325, so definitely check with toothpick!  Also, you can use 2 pkgs of vanilla INSTANT pudding or 1 of cream cheese if you don't have butterstotch.  I think putting 1/3 off batter, 1/3 off brown sugar mix, 1/3 batter, 1/3 brown sugar mix, then last of batter, last of brown sugar mix is the best.  It VISUALLY looks prettier when you cut it (again, see pic), and it also isn't too overwhelming.  Plus, any more layers then you don't get to taste the brown sugar mix and that's the best part right?  I never put nuts b/c the kids don't like it, but if I did ...I'd use pecans.",

Secondly, shame on the reviewers who gave it less than 5 stars when they altered the recipe!! When you substitute ingredients for lo-cal or change amounts, etc. you can't expect good results. And to the reviewer who gave this 3 stars because he used grape seed oil? instead of vegie! the oil DOES make a difference! Grape seed oil has a distinct flavor and mainly used for sauteing, and not baking. This cake is fabulous when YOU FOLLOW THE RECIPE~",
