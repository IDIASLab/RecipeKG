My one gripe would be that I followed the advice of others and seared the meat first which I found, after baking for 45 minutes left my chops a little on the dry side.  Next time, I'll probably just stick to recipe directions and not fry ahead of time.  Also the suggestion to bake the chops and apples over a bed of onions was a good idea and really added to the flavor of the dish!",
