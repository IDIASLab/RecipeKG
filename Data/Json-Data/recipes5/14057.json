Next time I think I'll use thick-cut chops and stuff them as I think they will hold together better - the stuffing wanted to fall out of the roast when cut. This made a great pickley olivey \"sauce\" in the pan. I had already made pasta with a parmesan/ garlic coating - but would have coated it with this if I'd realized it would be there...
