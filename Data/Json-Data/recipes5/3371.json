Chopped everything up, added mayo, and a generous slurp of hot sauce (the way I like it). Not your run-of-the-mill chicken salad. Good way to finish up those leftovers! I put the onion slices and mushrooms in a grill basket so they could be turned without falling apart as they cooked. Hope you like it!",

I really debated between the 3 or 4 stars, but in the end I really did like it, just don't think I'll be making it when I'm wanting a chicken salad sandwich.  My husband also liked it, but asked that I please make my usual chicken salad next time.  I used a little less onion than called for, but that is personal preference as I don't care for dishes with a strong onion taste.  The grilled onion was actually very good in this and gave it a slight sweet taste and crunch.  Overall a mixed review.  While we both acually enjoyed it, it won't be an everyday thing for us.  Maybe next time I'm in the mood for \"something different\".\r\n",

The chicken cooked nicely in a cast iron skillet and then we set it aside to brown the vegetables (in the skillet)...both were cooked in olive oil and we drained well before putting it in with the mayonnaise mixture. The onion used was \"Mayan Sweets\" purchased at Walmart. Neither of us can have soy so we used a canola-based mayo. Tabasco was used for the hot sauce. The mixture had a very nice color. We served this salad between toasted English muffins which made for a great taste....I would recommend chopping tiny if done this way (messy). If chopped small one might be able to do an open-faced sandwich on English muffins. The amount of sauce was perfect-not always easy to get by following the recipe for a chicken tuna etc. salad. It tasted great served a little warm-we were hungry and couldn't wait to eat it. I would serve this to guests (with or without some sort of bread) and that is saying a lot about my confidence in this dish as many of our guests have very conservative palates. We usually score dishes out of 10...this got a 9.",
