I would do 8 hours maximum for my slow cooker.  The sauce was really good and next time I\u2019ll serve them with something I can use the extra sauce on. \n\nUPDATE: I wanted to make this and I was sure I had both chili sauce and french onion soup but I had neither and I really wanted this dish so I made my own. This is how I made the chili sauce. \n1 cup tomato sauce\n1/4 cup dark brown sugar\n3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar\n1/4 teaspoon allspice\n1 teaspoon red pepper flakes  \nand for the french onion soup I used 10 oz of beef broth and mixed in a couple tbsp dried minced onion and 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce. When it was all cooked I thickened the sauce with 2 tbsp cornstarch mixed in 2 tbsp water. This sauce was just as good as the bought chili sauce and soup. I would do this again.",

I used this as the meat in a taco which I topped with some coleslaw. It was very good. I saved the \"gravy\" last night along with the leftover meat. Today (after removing the fat from the gravy) I added some vegetables to the meat sprinkled it with flour for thickening stirred the gravy in topped it with a pie crust and made a fantastic meat pie. This is a very good and versatile recipe.",

Since we didn't have any on hand I thought I might use Chinese restaurant packets of \"chili sauce.\" LOL! I squeezed one packet only and stopped because I tasted a drop of it and my mouth was burning like mad! Certainly the Panda Express type of chili sauce wouldn't be right for this recipe. I couldn't imagine dumping 12 oz of THAT on this dish EVER. LOL! I followed the recipe but added half an envelope of dry onion soup mix in addition to the canned. Also added minced garlic and about 1c. beef broth in order to cover the meat. I don't eat ribs; I made them for my husband and he said they were excellent with some bbq sauce added at the table. Will use this recipe if I let him have ribs again. I cried when I saw the ugly hard grease that cooled and covered everything --- this is bad for anyone with cholesterol issues. All in all I give this recipe a thumbs up!",
