I spread it on mini croissants for finger sandwiches at a party and it was a HUGE hit--they were the first thing to go from the buffet table. I reserved some leftovers for myself and it was even better the next day after the flavors had melded. I didn't use nuts since I was making it for a group but I think they would go great in it too.
