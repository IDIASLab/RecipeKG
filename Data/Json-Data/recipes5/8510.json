The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly but it tasted a bit watered down from other Butterbeers I'd had at Harry Potter parties. I blamed the club soda. It also didn't have a very buttery flavor and I blamed the caramel addition. So I made it again and this time I substituted cream soda for the club soda in addition to the cream soda it already called for and then instead of adding caramel I added more butterscotch to the whipped cream. Perfect. It was very similar to a root beer float just... butterier.:) Enjoy!",
