I found this recipe and decided to try it based on the reviews.  I used Habenero pepper instead of the jalapeno, dried Thyme instead of fresh (1/2 recipe calls for since it was dry), added about six cloves of garlic, and one kiwi.  It is very much like the chicken at DeBuss in Negril, but not as spicy.  We then used the leftover mix (you'll have tons leftover you can freeze for later) on some Halibut that remained frozen, then defrosted for three days in the fridge.  The flavor was very different on the Halibut; not nearly as spicy and more of an Oriental flavor (probably the soy sauce really sinking in the fish), but yummy still -just in a different way.  This is a very easy rub to prepare, and it worked great under the broiler and on the grill.",

If I could only quote my husband and my guests....\"unbelievable\" \"awesome\" \"sooo tender\" \"great kick to it\" etc. I marinated boneless breasts for about 6 hours. I did make a couple of changes...added 3 cloves crushed garlic two or three tablespoons lemon juice a good dash of black pepper used dried thyme and reduced to 3 green onions. I used Wildtree Herb's Roasted Garlic Grapeseed Oil instead of Veg. Oil. Next time I'll add more jalepenos I think. I can't wait to make it again! I'm a big fan of Wildtree Herbs' products...no preservatives MSG or questionable ingredients. I don't know where they're available around the country but their website is www.wildtreeherbs.com",
