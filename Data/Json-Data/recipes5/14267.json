This is my favorite Mexican breakfast dish and is great for a light dinner as well, serve with refried beans and some pico de gallo and you'll be craving for more! Garnish with more cilantro and sour cream. Great for leftover salsa verde or stale tortilla chips, perfect for a family brunch or other special breakfast occasion.",

Two of these guys forbid any use of cilantro, however and I don't think Cotija cheese adds much either, so neither of these ingredients were used.  I might also reduce the number of chips to 8 oz instead of 10 oz. since it was a bit on the \"chip-py\" side.  I did put chopped avocado on top which added great color.  Hubby might want the radishes on top for himself next time.",
