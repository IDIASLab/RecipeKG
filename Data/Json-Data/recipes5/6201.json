(Oh, I couldn't slice the cauliflower into \"steak slices\" so I just roasted big florets. Still FANTASTIC!  Will try using this marinade on broccoli and asparagus and bell pepper....and eggplant!",

You will only get two full \" steaks\" out of a fairly large head, the rest will crumble into large and small pieces. Using the grill pan right on the grill enables you to toss the pieces in with the steaks, way less mess on your grill. I brushed bottom of pan with the olive oil garlic mix, place the cauliflower in pan then rush the tops lightly and close the lid on the grill on medium heat (400 degrees). Veggies will start to sizzle in pan after a few minutes. Turn veggies after about 10 mins, cook until tender and visible grill marks. Cauliflower took about the same amount of time as my chicken kabobs on the other side of grill.",

Admittedly, I don't do steaks all the time, I do florets in the majority, but the flavor is divine either way.  It is very quick and easy to mix up and the flavors meld beautifully. Just enough spice to keep it interesting, and the acidity of the lemon counters the bitter of the veg.  I do enough for a week and use them in salads, reheat for sides, a great addition to tacos, or cold straight from the fridge (I have no shame!).
