Normally I would saut\u00e9 my vegetables and add about 2-3 table spoonfuls of Chinese cooking wine (Shao Xing wine) and a drizzle of sesame oil (you can find these at any Asian food store) when I'm cooking the vegetables. The wine and sesame oil will give it a fragrance but don't overdo the wine. If you use leftovers, you can stir-fry it again in a tablespoon of olive oil on a pan, add a bit of mushrooms or fresh vegetables to give it a fresher taste. I just added the egg mixture in the baking tin and topped it off with a combination of mozzarella and cheddar pizza topping cheese and baked it for 18 minutes in the airfryer.  Et voila! Delicious.",
