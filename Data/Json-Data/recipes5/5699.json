But when I looked at the ingredient list, based on my past experience, this type of flavour on fish wasn't my cup of tea. I couldn't find anything else and my family thought it sounded good so I made it. The only thing I did differently was to use olive oil since I didn't have vegetable oil. And it only sat in the marinade for about 10 minutes because that's all the time I had. I was completely blown away. This TOTALLY works on tuna. In fact it was perfection. Can't wait to make this again. Definitely a keeper!",
