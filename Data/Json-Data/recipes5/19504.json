I serve it with a stack of unsalted crackers and some apples (if I have time to \"lemonize\" them) if in a rush a pile of fresh cold seedless green grapes. If I am serving this as a dessert I will usually buy some brownies from \"Divine Brownies\" each one with a different flavor and frosting cut them diagonally it makes a beautiful presentation just so I have something else to offer if someone doesn't like or can't have cheese.",
