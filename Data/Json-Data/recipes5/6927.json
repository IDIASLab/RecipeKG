Not real sure why other than we didn t like the floral taste of the herbs de Provence in the mayo. Perhaps mixed a few hours or even a day ahead would have helped the flavors meld better and softened them some. I cooked the burgers in a Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven on medium grill for 5 minutes to perfection. I also spread softened butter on the buns and sprinkled with garlic powder before grilling in the CIO as well. I forgot to add the soy sauce to the mushrooms and didn t miss it one bit. The Ball Park buns were great and this was my first time using them. A lot of buns I ve tried tend to be a little on the sweet side and sometimes a little dry. Ball Park buns are fresh and great tasting.",
