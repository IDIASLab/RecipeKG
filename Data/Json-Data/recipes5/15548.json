Then for the ground beef I added two med sized cans of green peppers.  I did not put sour cream in with the ground beef.  I layered as follows: chips, ground beef, (2 cans) black beans, (1 large jar)pace chuncky salsa and mexican blend cheese.  I repeated all the layers one more time.  My husband said that it was a killer dish and he means that in a good way so I am making this again with my additions.  Thanks for the recipe",

I had it in my head to make this for supper when I realized I didn't have a taco seasoning packet, nor did I have a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I opted to use spices from my rack:  cayenne pepper, seasoning salt, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and italian seasoning.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used salsa instead of the canned tomatoes.  Due to many reviews saying the dish comes out dry, I used 1 1/3 cup salsa and 2/3 cup water in addition to the 1 cup sour cream.  I also added some diced black olives to the meat mixture before layering.  A wonderfully yummy, mildy spicy enchilada tasting casserole.  I have no doubt that if I had followed the recipe to a T (had I had the right ingredients) it would have turned out just as great.  ",

The chips were soggy and soaked up all the liquid which made the whole thing a little dry. I think it needs more meat and more cheese.",
