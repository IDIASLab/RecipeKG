I topped it w/ thinly sliced onions and salsa for the last 15 minutes. This tasted like an enchilada w/out all of the fat and calories. I also used my own blend of spices w/ no salt...salsa has plenty of salt in it already. I know I changed this recipe around but thanks for the idea...it will definately be cooked in my house again!",

Also made my  own bread crumbs with 2 pieces of toast.  Very moist and great flavor!  Will make again the same way!",

I added 3 tbsp of salsa since I figured the lean turkey would be dry.  Then I added only 1c plain breadcrumbs and ~1/4c rolled oat.  I did follow the other suggestions and added only 1/2 packet of taco seaoning, added some thawed corn and also 1/2c cheese inside as well.  My husband isn't big on onions, so I put in some onion powder instead.  It had tons of flavor and was very moist.  My husband is picky, but loved it!  I will definitely make this again.  I don't eat beef, so this is a great alternative for my family!",
