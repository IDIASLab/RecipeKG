The quartered with sugar tasted like one of my favorite restaurant dishes; when sliced, the sweetness of the sugar was overwhelming. Without sugar, quartered tasted like warm bananas. In conclusion, add sugar if you cut the plantains into bigger sections; omit the sugar if it is sliced more thinly.",

By the time I wanted to sautee them, the sugar and the moisture from the plantains had turned into a caramel sauce.  I used a non-stick pan and omitted the peanut oil. Absolutely delicious!  I served with the Cuban Pork Roast and the Corn and Black Bean salad from this site, along with my mango salsa (warmed) to top the pork and some basic Cuban rice for a fabulous meal. Will definitely make again and again!",

This makes each slice longer than the width of the plantain. I made 1 plantain, and it really is about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar per plantain. I added the salt into the brown sugar before dipping the plantains, and found this to be better than adding salt afterwards. However, before putting the plantains onto the pan, I gently wiped off excess clumps of sugar. It should really be a thin gooey coat of brown sugar on each plantain prior to placing them on the pan. I kept the heat on medium, and cooked each side until it was very dark brown. As far as the completed texture - it should be soft, but not mushy - and the coat should be nice and gooey and slightly sweet / salty. Enjoy!",

I bought them when they were yellow with slight black spots and let them sit on my counter for 2 weeks (yes, 2 weeks) until they were completely black and felt mushy.  Then I cut off the ends and used a sharp knife to cut thru the skin and peel it back to take out the flesh.  I sliced them lengthwise.  I melted 2 TBS of butter and 2 TBS olive oil over medium low heat.  I added the plantains and cooked them slowly for about 5 minutes then flipped them over.  I let them cook about 3 minutes longer then sprinkled the plantains with 2 TSP cinnamon and about 2 TBS of the brown sugar.  Let them cook about 1 minutes longer, flipped them one last time and immediately took them out and put them on a serving platter.",
