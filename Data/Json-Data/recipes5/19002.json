The only problem I have is using only a 1/4 cup of beer and then the rest gets wasted because I always start the marinade in the a.m.  So, I have learned to make a large batch of the marinade.  I freeze it with my chix breasts and also bags of cut-up peppers for my future fajitas.  I just pull it out in the a.m. to thaw and it's ready to grill by the time I get home.",

I added a little more of all the spices and a couple more cloves of garlic marinated 2 chicken breasts (cut up) in the fridge for about an hour.

It would be better in a category for just citrus marinade for chicken.",
