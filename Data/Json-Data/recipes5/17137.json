Instead of the flour for the thickening, add about 2 tlbs. of cornstarch to  3/4 cup of ketchep, mix it up well until there are no lumps and pour the ketchep mixture in the hot sauce, it's thickens nicely and ketchup is a must in sweet and sour sauce I think.  I added lots of chopped different colour peppers and onions.  Yummy over rice.",

Everyone at our Christmas party said it tasted very authentic and I suppose due to my slow cooker, the chicken was incredibly tender. Thanks so much!",

Took this to a pot-luck, served over white rice, and it was all but licked clean.  The best part: my family loves it.  Thanks!",
