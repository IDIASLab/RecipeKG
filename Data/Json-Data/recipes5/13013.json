I made horsey sauce from scratch at home instead of using prepared. I also made a mock-cajun topping instead. The red pepper sauce is excellent. I added about a TBSP of lemon juice and a little salt to bring out the flavors more. Yum. I'll probably just use crushed ritz crackers on top next time for simplicity and so other flavors don't compete with the flavor of the sauce.",
