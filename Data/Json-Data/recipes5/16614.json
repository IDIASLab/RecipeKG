The recipes are identical except an explicit statement that says: DO NOT BOIL the mix but simply heat and stir until brown sugar is completely dissolved and to let it cool for about 10 minutes before pouring slowly over the graham crackers.  This is a little time consuming but definately worth it in the end!  Mine turned out just as anuty has always made them :)\nUpdate:  Apologies, I didnt look at the pan size, my cookie sheet is roughly 12x16 and fits 35 crackers perfectly.",

For people who have had problems, this is what I do and they always turn out great.  Make sure the cookies lay flat in the pan - don't stack them.  I use 12 full graham crackers, broken in half (24 halves) and they fit the pan perfectly. Bring the ingredients to a light boil, stirring contantly.  As soon as the butter and brown sugar form a homogenous syrup, take them off the heat, add pecans (I also add some vanilla here), pour over graham crackers.  It should JUST cover the graham crackers, you may need to spread it with a spoon.  Immediately put in oven and bake on NONSTICK pan.  Let them cool until they come off in one piece, but no longer. Put on foil to cool COMPLETELY and harden before eating.",

I followed the recipe exactly, but first of all, it doesn't say how long to boil the ingredients. So as soon as mine came to a rolling boil, I added the pecans and poured it over the crackers.  #2 Graham crackers do not sink. lol!  Basically all the liquid ended up underneath the crackers. #3 The crackers turned to mush, and although the liquid thickened, it did not harden, so there was no way to eat these as \"cookies\".  There was no substance, just a layer of soggy cracker surrounded my a rich liquid.  If any of you have suggestions, I'd love to hear them. I can't imagine what went wrong, but unless I hear a great suggestion, I won't be trying this recipe again. Too bad...the ingredients sound heavenly!  Ally",

I've made this several times and without any additional ingredients, its excellent, but I also enjoy how you can tailor make this one to please a special someone by adding their favorite candy crushed topping a minute or two after it has come out of the oven.  I've added miniature candy coated Kisses, M&M's, and Reeses Pieces, but our all time favorite addition was 3/4 cup Heath Milk Chocolate Toffee Bits found on the baking aisle.
