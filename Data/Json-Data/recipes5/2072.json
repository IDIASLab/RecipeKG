These are time-consuming, and I recommend using oil in the deep fryer that is ready to change as the marinade will ruin it for cooking anything else. I've also done this technique successfully with squid. I've also added in very thinly sliced onion and green peppers to the marinade and it was really good.",

I followed the recipe as written until the step where the chicken is wrapped in foil. Here I substituted parchment paper putting 4 pieces of chicken on each square and a drizzle of the marinade and a few slices of scallion. I folded my packets and I baked them on a rack in a shallow pan at 375F for about 20 minutes. 15 minutes would likely have been long enough but we enjoyed the flavor and texture of the chicken.",

The marinade was so darned easy which is a plus. I had to make another change because I didn't have enough oil to fry these. I put them in a single layer on a aluminum foil lined jelly roll pan and baked them at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. The eating was the fun part. Yum! Will def make these when I do an asian menu to impress my guests. Thanks for sharing WitchyWoman.",

I did add two pieces of chicken per package used heavy duty foil and crimped and sealed them VERY tightly. They were perfectly cooked in 4 minutes. I didn't have a problem with smoking at all. The chicken was very moist and tender. I laid out (on a large platter) the chicken packages lettuce leaves grated carrot and scallion and let everyone make lettuce wraps. This does take a little time (wrapping the foil packs) so I enlisted the help of my husband. Fabulous chicken!",
