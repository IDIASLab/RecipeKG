I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and sprinkled the top of the pie with instant espresso and nutmeg before baking. If you try this add the espresso halfway through. I ended up with burnt espresso on top which didn't taste too bad but the aroma wasn't pleasing. Also don't go too heavy with the espresso because it can be pretty strong. We also decided to use a graham cracker crust which was extra delicious. Hope this helps!!",
