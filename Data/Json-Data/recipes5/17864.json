I needed to use up some evaporated milk (a cup exactly!) and some large marshmallows left over from S'mores this summer so I made this to top Cheesecake Bars from this site. It is yummy on those! I'm sure it would be great on ice cream too. I used walnuts instead of pecans just because that's what I had. Will have to try pecans next time. When I was stirring in the evap milk at the end it didn't look like it would incorporate at first so I got out the ol' whisk and that did the trick. This would be delicious without the nuts as well. This was so good I had to eat a few spoonfuls as I was putting it away!",

I used the remainder on ice cream and talk about good! Yum Yum! -19/09/07 Update: 16/10/09 - I have made this recipe countless times since I first found it and I have had trouble on occasions with the brown sugar not melting completely. When this happens I just pour the finished sauce into my blender and let it run for a minute - smooth sauce! This truly is the best caramel sauce I have come across and I use it for almost any recipe which calls for caramel topping. It is also great with some peanut butter blended in as well - but not too much to overpower the caramel flavour (just eyeball it) It thickens up a great deal with PB in it but is so delicious either way!",

When I read the ingredients with the pecans marshmallows etc. and I saw the picture I thought this was going to be a thick and gooey ice cream topping. It appears to just sit on top of the ice cream in the picture. Anyway it does taste like a melted praline candy but it is very \"soupy.\" It is good but really sweet but so are pralines. I just wished it was much thicker. But this would make a nice change to a regular caramel sauce on cheesecakes or other desserts where a thick dessert sauce is not neccessary.",

So to remedy that I put the sauce back over low heat and that enabled me to get my sauce totally combined. The flavor of this is excellent but I wished it had been a little thicker. I d also be tempted to add more pecans. I d make this again and maybe cut back a little on the evaporated milk in the hopes of getting a thicker sauce.",
