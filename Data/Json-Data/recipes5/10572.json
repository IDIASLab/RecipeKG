Added minced onions to the rub mixture and let it sit in the fridge for 2 days to dry-age. NOTE: It's important to the final dish to let the roast \"rest\" the appropriate amount of time after you pull it so the juices have a chance to absorb back into the meat. Glad I went ahead and made the vinegar sauce as it gave the roast that little something extra! Served with Amatriciana also from AR as the \"primo or first course\" of our dinner party. Rave reviews all around! Thank you Chef John.",

I omitted some ingredients (I don't have fennel seed) and added some and I think it was fabulous. I had made chef Johns butternut squash soup earlier in the day (YUM) and had leftover fresh sage. I used olive oil, seasoned panko (just a dusting), Rosemary, garlic powder, fresh sage, prosciutto, and Parmesan reggiano for the filling. Rolled it up and lightly coated the top with the same and put strips of prosciutto on top. I think it was one of the best dishes I ever made.",

Everyone was raving about how tender and tasty the pork was even though they never heard of porchetta before. I purchased a 6 pound pork roast and had the butcher butterfly the meat for me. The seasoning and flavors were perfect even though I forgot the orange zest. I did make a thin pan sauce from the drippings & served the pork with saut\u00e9ed apples (also from AR) twice baked potato casserole (also from AR) steamed broccoli & say to green beans.
