First I added sweet vidalia onions instead of ordinary white onion. I used diced tomatoes with basil and oregano instead of crushed tomatoes. I sauteed all the veggies except the tomatoes in olive oil along with mushrooms and black olives. I added the tomatoes near the end just to warm through along with a pinch each of red pepper flakes and italian seasoning. Also i used radiatore instead of angel hair pasta just because I like it better. With a few changes this was so good even my meat loving mother loved it! This is a new family staple.",

I did take a few liberties with the sauce though; instead of the crushed tomatoes I used a can of Hunts tomato sauce and a can of Hunts diced tomatoes because we like our pasta to have a more liquidy sauce. I also added oregano because I love that stuff. All in all even though boyfriend wished it'd had meat he still liked it and the roommate and I absolutely LOVED it. Very tasty and it isn't such a heavy pasta that it makes you feel sluggish after you're finished eating. I will definitely make this again and will definitely recommend it to others!",
