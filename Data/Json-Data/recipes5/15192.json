I've made biryani rice dishes before but never one with such rich, complex flavor and such a marvelous fragrance. After cooking, our home was filled with a subtle, exotic aroma that lingered for hours. NOTE: This and other biryani recipes are adaptable to simplifications and time savers, such as using thawed/steamed frozen peas;1/8 teasp crushed red pepper instead of seven whole peppercorns; crystallized ginger and dried garlic; and pre-diced onions, carrots, and potatoes.  Of course, the dish is best and most authentic with the freshest ingredients -- but better a \"quick\" biryani, I think, than no biryani at all at the end of a long day!  Depending on your preferences, you could eliminate some vegetables, but keep the onions, garlic, herbs & spices, broth, and rice. The turmeric imparts a lovely golden hue and sublime flavor.  I've had great success adding mushrooms as well. I advise a great mango chutney as accompaniment, with yogurt or sour cream.  It also keeps and reheats nicely for next-day dining!  ",

If eaten as a main I would suggest some cashews and raisins and perhaps a few green cardamon pods toasted in the begginning.  Good quality spices (not some old spice jar forgotten at the back of the cupboard) is key and makes the difference between  a mildly spicey rice and a truely authentic dish. As one other reviewer said the recipe is best with fresh, good quality ingredients (except for the peas which are usually sweeter when bought frozen), there are many shortcuts you can take with the veg but there is no compromise with the spices.",
