The aoli was a great compliment to this burger, and I made mine to look just like the one in the picture. Quick tip for this recipe. When done making each patty, lightly coat each side in flour. Put in freezer for about 10 minutes prior to frying. This, along with the egg, helps it stay together and not stick to spatula when placing in pan. \nAddt'l tip: I made a simpler version for my wife, who doesn't like onion or green pepper. I replaced these with onion powder and paprika, still turned out great for her patties.",

I also used my cuisinart griller to grill them in olive oil first, then I stuck them in the oven for 10 minutes to finish. For the mayo, I added fresh chopped cilantro, used regular mustard (just as good), and fresh ground pepper instead of lemon pepper.\n\nI also made my own \"focaccia\" buns by using two one inch pieces of french bread and covering them with a butter sauce I made out of\n\n2 tablespoons butter\n1/2 sprig of fresh chopped rosemary\n1/2 tbs dried onion\n\nI used my griller for the bread as well and it was PERFECT for the salmon!
