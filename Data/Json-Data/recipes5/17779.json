I made it exactly as written with the exception that I used walnuts instead of pecans. I did have to cook it a bit longer than the recipe but that is probably because I had cooked the yams the previous day and they were cold from the fridge. The topping came out slightly crunchy and made the walnuts almost seem candied. Yummmm!! Thank you for a great recipe!",

I had already cooked my yams in the oven, so I peeled them and put them in the blender with almond milk (we are dairy intolerant) and coconut oil in place of butter.  Mixed it and put into 9x9, topping with brown sugar mixed with coconut oil and topped with shredded coconut. This dish is lightly sweet in spite of the candied topping which was a nice surprise! For my husband (who HATES yams) this was a great recipe.  And of course the kiddo loved i (especially the brown sugar and coconut topping).  Way better than your typical (& nasty) marshmallow yam dish.",
