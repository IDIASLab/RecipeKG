In truth too, lots of folks confess to disliking them. I cook them anyway with chicken broth, vinegar, smoked sausage, bacon, ham, whatever I have, including boiling them in plain old water with some salt. This recipe was such an unusual break from the Southern norm I had to try it. I have never thought about using onions, garlic or liquid smoke and never dreamed of molasses and sugar. Collards are bitter so people disguise their servings with the brine from pickled peppers (hot or mild-\u201cpepper sauce\u201d as they say) and a dose of the peppers. These are delicious without the pepper sauce. Not sweet, easy to make and no one will ever guess they are healthy without the usual greasy flavorings. Very rich and mellow with a satisfying \u201csneaks up on you\u201d garlicy aftertaste. Thanks Billy, I finally found a way to make collards that I actually like instead of just endure. I\u2019ll never go back!",

Don't worry that the greens will be sweet because of the molasses and brown sugar- all they really do is cut the bitter taste of the greens resulting in smooth-tasting collard greens. There is nothing fancy about this recipe- it's just a really nice basic way to cook your collard greens for an everyday meal. I only rated it a \"4\" because the recipe should indicate that the stalk of the greens must be removed prior to cooking- a greens newbie would probably think the stalks are to be left attached like with swiss chard.",
