My 13 year old and husband gave it a \"10\" (we rate all of my food).\nI understand that the secret to this amazing recipe is doing it a mortar & pestle.  If you do nothing else in the mortar, at the very least add the oil and incorporate it this way as oils tend to get bitter when whipped in a Vitamix or other blender/processer.  This is one of the (many) keys to why this is so amazing.  Use all of the freshest ingredients available and you'll have yourself some RAVE reviews!  I only wish I had a huge mortar!!  This was gone in one night with three people eating it.  It is amazing on fresh, toasted (wood-grilled preferably) buttered sourdough bread as an appetizer, too!  DON'T heat it as it will ruin it.  Just mix it into hot pasta or serve on buttered bread.  Indulgent!!  LOVE!!",

But THIS...this recipe is worth it. It\u2019s so good. Just try it. I bought a mortar and pestle at tjmaxx for about $12. My tip is to fold a kitchen towel and place it under the bottom so that it doesn\u2019t bang as loud. And let the tool work for you, you don\u2019t have to put a lot of force into it or your hand will start to cramp. Then buy 2 baguettes and enjoy your life.",

It\u2019s really not that much work, even if it feels like it at first; I was surprised at how quickly the basil leaves were pulverized. I ended up putting the garlic through a garlic press into the mortar, because I wasn\u2019t having much success pounding it into a paste. The variety of basil I had might have been spicier than the Genovese type I\u2019m used to--this pesto was SO sharp, and so fragrant! I even pulled the green sprouts from inside the cloves of garlic to keep it from being overpowering. I only used about 1/2 ounce Parmesan and 2 Tbsp olive oil for my half batch; my cup nearly runneth over. I put a few tablespoons of my amazing pesto on penne pasta and inhaled it. I need bigger and better equipment because I want to eat this stuff all summer long.",
