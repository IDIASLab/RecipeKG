It had a lovely roasted taste and smell. For the larger, I cut in half, left the seeds in and cooked it open side down. Not only was it perfect, but the seeds were steamed and easily came out with a gentle scrape of a spoon. I put them in my air fryer til just crispy. They were delicious. How many times have I thrown away the seeds because rinsing, boiling then baking was just too much trouble for a handful of seeds. Not anymore! Nothing could be easier. Keep this recipe handy for the holidays to save time and have real pumpkin any time.",
