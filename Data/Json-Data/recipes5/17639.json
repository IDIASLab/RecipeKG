The second time I used mild italian sausage cut the italian seasoning in 1/2 used just a pinch of crushed pepper used a whole bell pepper & onion and added 1/2 to 1 Tablespoon of regualr sugar (still used brown & confection as well). It was soooooooo good! Probably the best spaghetti sauce I've ever had. Hard for me to say cuz Spaghetti has been my favorite since I was a kid! You'll love the waves of sweet and spice... Enjoy!!",

I used 5 roma tomatoes instead of 4 and simmered it for 4 hours or so. For the last 20 minutes I added meatballs. the family loved it and says i now make the best spagetti sauce they ever tasted. If you don't like overly thick sauce add a little bit of water. Will definitely make again.",

I think it was the allspice had a strong clove taste to it. I followed the recipe exactly except used mild Italian sausage.

I really never found one that I was crazy about until this one. The closest I get to homemade is to buy the Spatini packages at the store. While this recipe is time consuming and probably better made on the weekend if you are one of those busy working moms like I am it really came out great especially if you are a person that likes spicy food! (my family loves spicy:) The only change that I made to the recipe was to add some water to thin it somewhat. We tend to like thinner sauces and this one is most definitely thick! It smells wonderful while it is cooking and will certainly become one of my recipe box recipes:)",
