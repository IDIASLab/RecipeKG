As I served it I sprinkled Chili-Cheese Fritos over each bowl. This was a great quick dinner and a nice compromise for a mother that's sick of regular taco dinners and kids who can't get enough. I made homemade fry bread to serve with this. I would make this again but I think I would mix the sour cream into the french dressing next time and fold it in with the rest of the salad ingredients.",

We used lean ground beef reduced fat sour cream lite french dressing and lower fat cheese and substituted tortilla chips for corn chips. The beauty of this recipe is you can add \"extras\" if you like: sliced black olives are good and I chopped a handful of cilantro and squeezed fresh lime juice over it to make it to our liking. I garnished it with avocado slices too. The pasta is what makes this taco salad anything but ordinary -- tasty great mix of textures and good fresh meal to serve.",
