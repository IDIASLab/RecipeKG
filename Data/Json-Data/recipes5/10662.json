After deciding to grill swordfish steaks but not having carb side dish I looked around to see what I could find to put on top of the fish to add interest and flavor. This recipe popped up and the tomatoes called to me. I didn't have red wine vinegar and just added red cooking wine - more than a splash if you get my drift! Then I added an additional clove of garlic some snipped fresh parsley and a teaspoon or so of capers. After it sat in the fridge for about an hour I put the sauce with the chopped tomatoes in the pan and cooked it down to the thickened stage. We found it a perfect accompaniment to the swordfish and will definitely even buy tomatoes to make this again.",
