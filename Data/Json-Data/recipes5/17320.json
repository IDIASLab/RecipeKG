However....I adapted it 3 yrs ago from TX Land and Cattle restaurant's version, only they use brown sugar and Shiner Bock dark beer!  With this bourbon version, I lay my fillets out and gently press the brown sugar into the fillets, then sprinkle them with the bourbon - I let them \"rest\" for about 30 minutes before quickly browning the sugar glazed filets over med-high heat in a non-stick saucepan, about 2 min each side. I wrap up the cooking process by popping them in the microwave for 1-1 1/2 minutes, depending on the thickness of the filets. These filets make a terrific presentation in a romaine-based salad with a topping of honey and brown sugar glazed coarsely chopped pecans (Johnny Carino's restaurants serve it like this) Enjoy! Impressive and will work well over the holidays.",

I was hoping that the bourbon would make \"saucier\" caramel but it all evaporated off & the caramel was indeed, caramel. I made extra to use as a topping & as soon as it hit the plate it solidified into a pretty tasty, chewy morsel of caramel. But who wants to peel caramel off their plate? LOL The flavor was great paired w/ the salmon though so next time, I'll add the bourbon later so that it doesn't all cook off. I paired this w/ brown rice cooked in wine & chicken broth & a salad w/ rice pudding for dessert. Thansk for a nice recipe Debbie F...we enjoyed it.",

I let the sauce simmer to a glaze after I removed the fish.  The glaze is very flavorful/sweet, so if you are afraid of overpowering your salmon, I'd skip this recipe or leave the extra glaze off.  I, however, enjoy the strong, sweet flavor and used a generous amount over my fish and brown rice :).",
