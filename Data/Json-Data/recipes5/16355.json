My complaint with this was the writing of the recipe, which leaves a bit to be desired.  1  1/3 tsp?  2 2/3 TB?  Who has those measuring spoons?  I found the recipe too wet and had to add quite a bit of extra flour to be able to knead it.  It definitely needed to be cooked longer - 40 minutes was still not enough to cook the center.  Also, the kneading instructions were a bit vague.  Knead 15-20 minutes until...?  I used my mixer and only kneaded about 5 minutes.  I'm going to play again with this recipe, because, again, the flavor was very good.",
