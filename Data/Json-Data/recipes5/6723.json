Oh my, the onions with the jerk marinade are just lovely and next time I'll definitely be (at least) doubling the thinly sliced onions.  I think if I were to follow this exact recipe again I might add some jerk seasoning to the marinade- it just wasn't seasoned strongly enough for my liking.  I'm sure that's related to the strength of the marinade used, though.  I did not remove the skin- I like letting the skin get crispy and being able to remove it easily after it cooks.  An easy and delightful dinner!",
