It will start sizzling and you could get a minor burn.(You don't even need to add water ) Other than that I think you'll enjoy it.

I dilute my cornstartch with a few tablespoons of very cold water before adding to any recipe. That way you don't use as much and aviod it from turning to sludge later!",
