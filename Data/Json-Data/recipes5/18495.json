I followed the exact recipe - the only thing I changed was the baking dish. I used a pie dish because I was serving this as a dessert for dinner company and wanted something different from the same ol' dessert square. The pie dish was a little deeper than the recommended dish so I could have let the shortbread cook a little longer but I found that I really like the slightly chewy center. I served it topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream a couple dashes of ground cinnamon and nutmeg and fresh berries. My guests thought it was TO DIE FOR and are still raving about it. This will be a staple dessert in my house from now on.",
