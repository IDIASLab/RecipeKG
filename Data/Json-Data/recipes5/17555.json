I let it come to a boil then boiled it gently for about 2 minutes to make sure the sugar was dissolved. Making a half recipe of this as well as a half recipe of \"Hot Fudge Sauce\" was perfect to use a full can of the sweetened condensed milk and both sauces complemented my homemade banana and vanilla ice creams (for Turtle Sundaes) nicely.",
