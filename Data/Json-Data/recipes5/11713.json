The result tasted only barely if at all of curry and was not even remotely creamy. The first problem is that the yogurt curdled. If you look at the recipe photo you'll see that this has happened there as well. In retrospect this isn't surprising. Yogurt (even full-fat yogurt) doesn't have much fat and will curdle when added to a hot pan if not properly prepared. Adding some starch (flour or cornstarch) to the yogurt beforehand can prevent this. The second problem is that the corn tasted primarily of garlic. I don't have a problem with garlic but this recipe is called \"curried corn\" not \"garlic corn\". I followed the recipe with two exceptions: I substituted red pepper flake for the cayenne and I omitted the chives.",
