I sliced the kielbasa thinly and fried in a pan with a 1/3 cup of diced green pepper, a half cup of chopped onion and thinly sliced fresh garlic until the veggies were soft. I set this aside and began on the sauce. Following others advice, I used only 1 cup of ketchup, 2 tbsp of butter, omitted the water and added 1 cup of crushed pineapple with the juice. I also added a tbsp. of flour to thicken a bit. When the sauce was done, I added the kielbasa with veggies back in. Oh my! The taste is soooo good. I served on a bed of yellow rice. I was looking for a tasty way of adding zip to my kielbasa.  Try this and you won't go wrong!",
