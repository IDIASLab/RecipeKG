I'd like to point out that although the nutrition information makes it sound like this recipe is high in fat, most of the oil stays in the pan when you're done.  It's just there to make the seasonings adhere to the chickpeas, and to keep the chickpeas from sticking to the pan.  Probably some cooking spray would do the same trick if you're concerned.",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent!  A few tips: first.. the quality of your chickpeas will cause these to be mealy, or not. Field Day organics sells amazing chickpeas in a can, and they are creamy, not mealy, so they roast the best (make best hummus too). Next choice is Westfield organics. While I use Trader Joe's organic chickpeas in other recipes, this recipe will taste mealy if you use Joe's for this.\n\nNext, the lemon.. if you use a meyer lemon for juice, its great. I also added zest from the meyer and that's even better, has a lemon flavor but not too tart.\n\nAs for the oven, if you make these in a conventional / older oven, they will likely not crisp well at 25-30 minutes if at all with more roasting. However, in a convection oven, the coating was perfectly adhered to all the chickpeas, the Fieldday and Westfield organic peas all came out non-mealy, and they crisped up in 25 minutes. \n\nSuggest making this in a good quality toaster oven with convection roasting if you can and otherwise have a regular oven. Saves energy too.",
