You can use a food processor to 'mash' the livers, but the result is too refined for my taste, too much like a pate; traditional chopped liver is lumpy! If you're willing to do the mixing with your hands, you'll get the best results. NOTE: Under NO circumstances should you add beef or any other kind of liver or filler; this will spoil the flavor. Enjoy!",

I had never made any kind of liver, so I didn't even know where to begin.  I found your recipe and followed it to the letter, even down to the Hungarian Paprika (which was wonderful).  Everyone raved about the chopped liver, and there was not a drop left.  I was worried when I saw the first person reach for the liver, but when she commented that it was wonderful, everyone stood at the dish, eating until it was gone.  Thank You Val, for a wonderful recipe.",
