Great as a side with steak, chicken, or our favorite, Louisiana style barbecue shrimp. 2) By no means do you actually need an hour and a half to make these. Cook on the stove for the quick-cooking method (5-10 min), reduce the amount of added liquid and bake for 15-20 min. They will be very soupy at first, but will thicken when cooled.",
