Proportion of sour cream to mayo in that recipe is 2 to 1 so it does not have an overwhelming mayo taste. The secret to keeping dip from being runny is to squeeze as much water out of the spinach as possible. I use paper towels for this.",

I added half a can of very finely chopped water chestnuts only 1/2 cup each of sour cream and mayo sprinkled in some parmesan cheese and added an 8 oz. container of cream cheese and an extra couple of drops of lemon juice. In addition to the seasoned salt I sprinkled in some McCormick's vegetable seasoning since I couldn't find any Knorr's. Oh and I only added 1/4 cup of green onions. Yummy!:-)",

I've served it with cubed sourdough pumpernickel Asiago cheese bread cocktail rye or even whole wheat crackers. Even the dip in the veggie tray is usually passed over for this. This dip even works with reduced fat sour cream and mayonnaise. I also add garlic powder a little white pepper and on the suggestion of other posters water chestnuts. Fabulous!",

I doubled the recipe because I was feeding a big crowd and added 8oz cream cheese a can of chopped water chestnuts two packages of Lipton vegetable soup/dip mix cut back half on the mayo and sour cream and also on the green onion. I thought it was delicious right after mixing it but I let it set over night and it had too strong a spinach taste for me so I added more mayo and it snapped back just the way I wanted it and people were very complimentary.
