The potatoes were absolutely delicious!! I think the recipe should read 1/2 lemon and not a 1/2 c? That is a lot of lemon juice which over powered the citrus flavors. The chicken was ok rather dry some of the breading became soggy. My kids asked for ketchup/mustard & even I opted to dip it in mustard. Overall I like the idea of using one pan for dinner and using parchment paper was genius however this was a little bland and had a lot of prep for one sheet pan. I would prepare the cutlets as written then fry them and roast the vegetables as described on the parchment because the potatoes were amazing!!",
