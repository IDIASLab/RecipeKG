The final result is addictive and goes with everything on this menu, so I like to make 2 batches--one plain and one with the optional turmeric--which adds a little extra flavor and a pretty orange color.",

The only thing that I did different, was I used about 10 - 15 cloves of peeled garlic, which I smashed, Just as the garlic started to brown, I removed it from the oil with a slotted spoon and set aside and then added it back on top of the rice while it was browning. This allowed me to let the rice to get good and crispy without worry of the garlic over browning, which I\u2019m not a fan of. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!",
