I had to mix everything in my Dutch oven after cooking meat on onions in my largest skillet as the skillet wasn t big enough to hold all the ingredients. I went heavy on the curry and cayenne since we like spicy and a bit lighter on the cinnamon and cloves. It was wonderful! I m enjoying trying new recipes to use the bottle of curry powder I bought. Thanks for sharing this is a keeper!",
