I did use chicken broth instead of water and strongly suggest you use chicken or vegetable broth for a more complete flavor which compliments the mild Italian sausage. I also added garlic and used Italian seasoning. This recipe is a great base to begin with and gives you the opportunity to make it all your own with your ideas and additions.",
