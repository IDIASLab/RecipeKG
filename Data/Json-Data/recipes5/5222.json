Hubby wants canned salmon but I'll use this more often and buy the canned salmon for him. Great recipe. So easy and light.",

( It smelled great when it was cooking! ) I did set the patties in the fridge a few min. To firm up which helps a lot....anywho once everything was all ready I took one bite and spit it out! It was awful. It tasted like fishy nasty in my mouth. If you're thinking I don't understand the \"star system\" you're wrong. My family seriously like it. My 13 year old daughter even ate mine AFTER eating her own. They all just ate it up! So I would recommend it maybe I am the only one that hates it!!",

I only had bottled lemon juice on hand and reduced to half as the mixture smelled a little too lemony at that point. They were perfect but found we had to add more bread crumbs to try binding the mixture (used fresh salmon). Recipe needs some sort of binder to hold the patties together better. Ours fell apart a little in the pan but not too bad. Used Jan's Old Bay Seasoning Substitute (from this website) which worked great flavor wise in this recipe. Topped the burgers with McDonald's Tartar Sauce Copycat also from this website. Overall a very tasty recipe and will make it again with some minor tweaks. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
