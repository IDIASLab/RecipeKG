Then I put the two fillets in a 9x9 pan, drizzled most of the marinade over the top, and then baked it in the oven (covered) at 350 for 15 minutes, and then I uncovered it and baked it at 375 until it was done (probably another 10 minutes, I didn't set the timer).\nThe salsa is great, too. It really makes enough for about 4+ fillets, but I enjoyed the leftovers with chips, so I don't know that I would ever cut the salsa recipe in half. I paired this with some coconut rice and asparagus. I'll definately make this again.",

The mango has roughly 110 for 1 cup which is what my mango chopped up came out to.  That is of course divided into for 2 people.  The olive oil is high caloric and fat, but it is in the marinade.  Most stays behind in the bag.  The calories in the rest of the ingredients is small. Nutrition facts on the website need to be more accurate. Great dish.  Thanks for posting. ",
