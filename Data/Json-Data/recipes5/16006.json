I used medium salsa which I highly recommend. It gives enough heat to keep the casserole from being bland. I also used more turkey to finish the leftovers and I don't think it negatively impacted the dish. I liked a glob of sour cream with my serving and I think it sliced and served neatly because I assembled it early. You could also kick in some sliced black olives! As written with the extra cup or so of turkey it easily served 4-6",
