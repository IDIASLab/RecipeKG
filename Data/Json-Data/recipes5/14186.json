You can add more heat by doubling the chili powder and cayenne pepper and adding a few of the seeds from the jalapeno. You can use beef, too! You can serve these on burger buns, in tortillas or in pitas garnished with with some shredded cheddar, pickled jalapeno slices and chipotle mayo. (If you have a more classic taste, American cheese, pickles and ketchup still tastes good as well!)",

It has a nice seasoning and gets bonus points because it does not use ketchup.  The tavern (a.k.a. loose meat sandwich) originated in the 1920s.  It\u2019s nothing more than browned ground beef that contains very little or even no seasoning what-so-ever.  It caught on quickly with businesses because it was cheap, easy, and \u201cone-sandwich-fits-all.\u201d  It was served on a bun and via a condiments bar, the customer could create their own sandwich by adding whatever toppings or sauces they desired.  It could be turned into a traditional topped hamburger/cheeseburger, sloppy joe, etc.   The only thing that\u2019s changed with the modern day tavern is the number of ways it\u2019s served.   I\u2019ve seen many organizations use these for fundraisers, giving the customer the choice of having it served on a bun, tortilla, hard shell taco, or even fry bread.  The combinations are endless.",
