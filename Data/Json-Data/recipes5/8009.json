My mom made this dish often when we were little and occasionally she would switch it up a bit by chopping the bologna and eggs adding minced onion and mixing it with an oil and vinegar dressing. My grandfather was a butcher so we always had good German bologna in the house. If you're lucky enough to have a German butcher store in your area I'd suggest going for the couple of extra bucks instead of using bologna from the grocery store. Haven't had this in years and I must say it brought back a lot of memories. Thanks so much Margaret!",
