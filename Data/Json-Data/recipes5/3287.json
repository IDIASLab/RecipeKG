I recommend doing a test falafel... and if it falls apart, just add another egg. I would use very little bread crumbs, if any.\n\nAnother scary problem is that the baking powder (which may be a typo.. as every other falafel recipe I know uses baking soda), cause the oil to bubble up/foam... one batch it foamed over creating a fire hazard on my stove.\n\nAs for the sauce, I didn't use the dill, but I added two cloves of finely chopped garlic. The second time I left out the mayo and didn't miss it at all.\n\nAll in all, this is a good base... but be wary of the falling apart and foaming issues.",

The sauce tasted great, but, a tad too sweet for me.  So, I added in some more salt to even it out.  Plan on using the sauce for salads in the future!\r\n\r\nI mashed the chickpeas without a blender, as the recipe says, and the texture was nice.  This is really laborious, so if you're short on time, just use a blender on a gentle setting.\r\n\r\nI also made the following preparation changes:\r\n\r\n1) After forming the falafel balls, I covered them in bread crumbs.  This creates a nice texture.  Form the patties after this.\r\n\r\n2) To make less fatty, baked the falafel patties in an oven instead of deep frying.  I covered an oven pan with aluminum foil (easy cleanup!) then very lightly greased it with olive oil.  Bake the patties at 425F  for 20 minutes then turn over and baked for another 8-10 minutes.  They brown well and turn out great.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",

                "reviewBody": "I had to make a few alterations... this recipe would best be used as a \"guide\" for making falafel.  \n\nFirst - DOUBLE the recipe!  The mixture will hold for a few days in the refrigerator and also freezes well - especially important for busy individuals/families.\n\nMashing the chickpeas by hand is very important for texture/consistency.  I used 2 (15 oz) cans of chickpeas and it took less than 5 minutes to mash by hand - so it's not as laborious as others have stated.  \n\nMy best recommendation:  Use a generous handful each of fresh parsley and cilantro for great flavor.  The seasoning measurements are perfect.  DO NOT use egg or breadcrumbs, use flour instead.  You will need approximate 4-8 tablespoons - start with 4 T and add additional flour as needed until you are able to form a small ball and it doesn't stick to your hands.  I recommend test frying one ball (or disk); if it falls apart you must add more flour.  It is also highly recommended to refrigerate the mixture for a few hours to allow the flavors to mingle.  I typically make the mixture the night before or the morning of - and fry in the evening for a quick fix meal.  These can be baked but are must tastier fried!  Fry in 2-3 inches of oil at 375 degrees.  Traditionally falafel is served with a tahina sauce - but I much prefer using homemade Tzatziki instead (made with strained yogurt, strained shredded cucumber, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and dill).  MMMM delicious!",

I would say the whole thing is a bit labor-intensive so do it on a slow night, but TOTALLY worth it.  I can't cook at all and I still managed to make this perfectly.  I followed the first reviewer's great suggestions to roll the balls in bread crumbs and to bake (at 425 degrees, 20 minutes then flip then another 8 minutes) instead of fry.  I also replaced the baking powder with baking soda.  Finally, I skipped the dill weed and used a sprinkle of coriander on the cucumber sauce and it turned out delicious.",

With damp hands shape into balls and put on a sheet brushed with olives oil. I bake at 425 for 15 minutes on one side and 10 on the other the outside was crispy and the inside was moist.
