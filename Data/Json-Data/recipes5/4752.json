For the turkey broth I used my leftover gravy and I added 2 cups of water to that.  I used  1 percent milk instead of half and half. I also used a packet of cheddar potato soup mix by Bear Creek. I have to say this soup was better than any soup I have ever had at any resteraunt. I am making one more batch in a couple days and freezing it for a cold winter night.",
