I was looking through the barbeque sauce recipes hopefully looking for some ideas to doctor up (believe it or not) a couple of bottles of plain old Kraft Honey Barbeque sauce that I had! Better yet I had all the ingredients for this recipe and it got good reviews. Thanks Sue for my Real Recipes from Real People cosmic connection for the day. Just what the doctor ordered for my pulled pork. Didn t change a thing 5 stars tangy and yummy. Exactly the flavor I was wanting. Seems like a lot of brown sugar but the lemon juice keeps it from being too sweet. The whole can of cola seems like it will be too thin and watery. But stir it up really well and it s thicker than you think. I simmered mine a few minutes to soften the dried onions.This makes a lot. Next time I might scale the recipe in half.",
