There is no need for a lot of salt. I usually use cultured butter it has a bit more flavour than regular unsalted butter but is not always available. You can certainly use salted butter if you want. But the amount of sugar certainly makes up for the lack of salt. The dough is also more of a shortbread or pastry dough that's why there is no need for chemical leavening. Also if you dry the chopped cherries on paper towel before mixing into the dough your log should keep it's shape and easily be cut. When you do make the dough take some photos if you can.

I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla which could be part of them not having a very bold flavour. The dough was so soft that I couldn't roll it into a log so I stuck it in the fridge overnight (almost 24 hours) and tried to roll them into a log again still too soft and sticky resulting in losing a lot of the dough to my hands. But not one to waste ingredients I put some flour on some wax paper and rolled it that way and stuck it back in the fridge for a couple more hours. When I went to cut it the dough was too soft resulting in me having to roll each slice and press back into shape. The taste is good just not a very strong cherry flavour and that's okay the almond extract would've helped with that. But the difficulty in making them made them lose a star perhaps using them as a drop cookie would be better.",
