Follow this....\nI, like others suggested...added a little bbq sce..already open in the fridge.. like 1 Tbs.  I threw in fresh garlic w/ the celery and onion. (buy one of those big jugs of garlic at the store) That brings me to the people that left out the celery and onion for the kids.  Everyone has a little handy chopper in thier pantry, right?  Add the onion, celery and whole garlic to the chopper and grind up really small. Then throw it in the dishwasher... Brown that with the meat, set aside after draining.  (I also used 1/2 turkey) Then put the tomato soup (with no \"E\" on the end spelling it,, sorry it makes me crazy :) with the splash of W.sce, vinegar, ketchup & bbq in the pan and sautee.  I did not add any b.sugar since I read the reviews first.  I did however add ONE drop of liquid smoke.  Cook a few minutes then add the meat/onion/celery/garlic mixture back to the sauce.  Cover and simmer 15 mins or so... I guarantee it wont be bland! The whole thing took 25 minutes, maybe.  Thanks for the post! Great way to use canned tomato soup in my pantry ($.25) It was delicious, and the kids loved it WITH the onion and celery, no body even noticed! ",

It's one of my 4-year old's faves, so I tried this recipe and it was really good! I modified it a bit by skipping the onion & celery (the kid won't eat chunky stuff) and substituted onion powder. I also used tomato puree b/c that's what I had on hand and it was just fine. Along with being incredibly easy, it's a great base recipe and easy to modify depending on your tastes.

My 9 year old was not so thrilled with it.\n\nI changed things up just a bit.  I omitted the celery, used canned tomato sauce instead of soup and substituted real garlic for garlic powder.  I used onion powder and instead of  salt I used a few shakes of Lawry's seasoned salt to get the celery taste without the chunks. I also cut down on the brown sugar since the first few times it came out a little too sweet.  I left out the vinegar and put in a healthy  few dashes of  A-1 steak sauce. I reduced the ketchup to a few tablespoons and put in a few shakes of hot sauce.\n\n Other than that, I toasted the  buns and put out shredded cheddar for those who wanted it. I put a few extra dashes of hot pepper sauce in my older son's sandwich since he likes hot and spicy.\n\nIt's a keeper recipe for me when I need a one dish meal.",
