And that wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the color; the brownish-green color was the most unappetizing smoothie color I've ever seen. The Cook's Notes said to add ice so I did blend it with crushed ice. Yes low in calories and fat but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's healthy with 892 mg of sodium. All I could taste was the Clamato and a hint of lemon but would never know that there was any spinach in this. I like fruit smoothies but I also like kale and spinach smoothies. Sorry I know that this is the first review but this just didn't work for me and I won't be making it again.",
