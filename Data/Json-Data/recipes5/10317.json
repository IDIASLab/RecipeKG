In the video Chef John used a silpat liner which I am sure would have worked better for non stick but I didn't want to clean even the silpat.  I served these for the Monday Night Football crowd and there was not a single one left.  I did add some granulated garlic and onion powder.  I mixed up the spices and wings without the flour and held them in the refrigerator.  Just before baking I sprinkled with the flour and tossed them to coat them well.  The wings were nicely carmelized and took about 45 minutes total.  They held well in a chaffing pan for over an hour.  I am going to make this with chicken thighs - I bet they will be great.",

I marinated them for about 4 hours turning them every 45 minutes or so. EVERYONE in attendance asked for the recipe so I decided to post this comment.",
