Used red onions for color. didn't have fresh mint but tons of dried so added two tbsp. to the dressing. Made an emulsion in the food processor with the mint sumac salt oil and lemon juice. I like a burst of lemon flavor (as opposed to just acerbic) so did grate some fresh rind of the lemon too. a sprinkle of EVOO on the pita before popping into the oven. thanks for the recipe.",
