Then I sliced the sprouts lengthwise and baked sliced side down in the oven at 475 degrees for 15 minutes. They will get a nice little char on them, just watch carefully to ensure they don't burn. While the sprouts cooked, I added the butter and seasonings from the recipe (all quantities the same) to a small sauce pan. Then I added about 8 tbsp's of coconut milk and reduced the sauce slightly. Once the sprouts were cooked, I placed them in a large bowl and tossed with the sauce. To quote both my girlfriend and roommate, both of whom assured me they hated brussel sprouts, \"Oh my god, these are the best brussel sprouts I have ever eaten.\"",

This recipe could help to change that! I soaked the sprouts in salt water for 1 hour prior to cooking. For the jerk seasoning I used a recipe from this website. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and added a little water near the end of the cooking time and then covered the pan for a bit in order to steam them and make sure they were fully cooked and tender.",
