It's has a slightly sweet taste from the thousand island dressing.  My husband really liked it.  It makes another good chicken dish to serve instead of beef or pork.  Think twice about putting the crushed chips in the salad.  This recipe makes a large bowl of salad.  If you don't think you are going to eat all of it and may have left overs, put the crushed taco chips on each individual serving.  Otherwise, the left overs will have soggy chips in it.",

I ate mine with just the lettuce, a little 2% cheese and a little FF sour cream but the family ate as is, with the thousand island, cheese and sour cream on the side. My husband liked it with the dressing but the kids wouldn't even try it. For me, this was a low calorie/low carb dinner and a boy pleaser, even though it was made with ground turkey. I suggest you make yours with a homemade taco seasoning only because the flavor is a lot better and there's less salt/fillers.",

Waiting also afforded us the ability to heat it up right before serving the leftovers. We will be making this again. It was also very economical. Thank you.",
