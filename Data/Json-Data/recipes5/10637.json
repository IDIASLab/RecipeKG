This recipe for fromage blanc, or farmer's cheese, flies in the face of that conventional culinary wisdom. So why bother? Because, for any self-respecting foodie, making a batch of homemade cheese is definitely on the culinary 'bucket list.' Before you cash in your apron for good, you should experience the magic of watching a pot of milk turned into cheese. And if all this sounds kind of cheesy, so be it.",

This did not remind me of ricotta, but sort of a mild feta, which really appealed to my ricotta hating, feta loving hubby. So simple and VERY tasty...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Before putting it into ramekins I divided it  in half and put a little  Old Bay and as much crab meat as it would take and still hold together.  The second half I added a little onion powder (not onion salt) (be very careful and use less then you think) and chopped fresh oregano, thyme and chives.  My husband loves both versions.  More experimenting with flavoring in the future.",

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and did have to add the additional teaspoon of lemon juice. The juice may not have been acidic enough since I squeezed it from an older lemon last week. Anyway, the curds were loose and wet. The flavor is going to be wonderful! On the second batch, I used 1/4 teaspoon of lemon juice (just for the flavor) and one scant 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid. Ding, ding, ding, we have a winner! The cheese curds were perfect and the finished product just rolled off of the cheesecloth. Very tasty too! Only one other change, I used one layer of cheesecloth instead of four.  I wash the cloth so it has a tighter weave and it allowed the whey to properly drain. LOVE THIS RECIPE! I can't wait to try different herbs and spices in it! Thanks Chef John for ANOTHER great recipe!",
