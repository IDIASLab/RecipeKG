Here's the difference: She layers in a 2 qt. casserole - 3 C. fresh apple chunks with peels (I used the bag of tart sliced apples from the grocery store) 2 C. fresh cranberries 1 1/2 C. sugar (I use Splenda). Then tops it with a mixture of 1 1/2 C. rolled oats 1/3 C. flour 1 1/2 C. chopped pecans and 1 stick melted butter or margarine. Bake covered at 425 for 1 hour. This has a bit fresher taste has more crunch and less syrupy-ness. Both are great but wanted to offer this version made with fresh fruit. Enjoy!",

Loved that recipe so much I doubled it so still had some left over -- maybe about 2 cups or so. Cut fresh Gala apples -- about 4 large ones -- until the consistency looked rather like not just cranberry sauce but somehow more like pie filling -- no spices or additional sugar then put topping on. I loved it and will always keep this in my recipe file as I hate throwing out homemade cranberry sauce after the holiday feasting is over. Very very tasty. Needs no tweaking on spices at all. The fruits (in my case apple cranberry and orange juice) carry the recipe to perfection.",
