This requires more time but less stressing over sticking and burning. The outside of the potatoes were nicely browned and the insides were smooth and soft. Don't rush this but keep an eye on them the last 15 minutes, mine were cut a bit smaller and were done beforehand. I just used my iron fry pan in the oven and it worked very well.

I'm not a potato lover in general b/c I think they are too starchy and bland.  This recipe was delicious and super flavorful!  I followed the recipe exactly with only two changes.  I substituted Savory (dried) because I did not have fresh or dried rosemary or thyme on hand.  I used it generously. And since I'm not wild about potatoes, I cut the red potatoes into bite-sized pieces, so you get less potato center in proportion to the crusted browned edges. Use a  small metal spatula to get under the potatoes without breaking them up instead of a spoon. Oh, I also added yellow peppers to the red ones suggested.  It made the dish so pretty! A wonderful recipe that I will definitely make again, especially for company since holding them only enhances the flavor!",
