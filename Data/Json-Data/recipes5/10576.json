I rated it 4 stars because I changed the spices so much to add more flavor. Here are comments and changes:\n1. Used 5 skin on chicken thighs vs duck legs and took skin off after browning\n2. Used 1.75 lbs andouille sausage because I did not use cray fish\n3. Cooked roux in oblong cast iron pan so only took 20 min\n4. I did not add 2 more TB of flour because we wanted soup bowls not plates\n5. I used a lot more stock 2.5 32 oz boxes( for Roux I used his amount of stock and added extra in soup pot)\n6. I used Chef John's thyme and cayenne but added a large sprinkle of garlic powder and 2T of Emerl's Bayou blast and file powder in the end\n7. I strained off a lot more fat and used 2T in the rice instead of butter\n8. Chopped green onion and parsley sprinkled on rice\n9. Loved John's tips of using some fat from meat for roux and using pickled okra\n10. Only make this when you have a day off and for friend's and family who appreciate gumbo\n\nI made this last Sunday and making Chef John's American onion soup this Sunday",
