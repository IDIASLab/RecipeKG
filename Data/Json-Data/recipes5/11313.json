I also didn't have spicy refried beans so I added 1/8 tsp Cayenne and I think next time I'll add even more. I also used a mixture of pepper-jack and cheddar cheese. The only thing I'd caution about the recipe is the serving sizes: the recipe says it makes 6 servings but those would be 6 measly little servings that would only leave you sad and wanting more (each serving would be about 1/3 of a cup which might be a true \"serving \" but most people tend to eat more than that for beans). I made the recipe for a dinner with 6 people and after making one batch decided I needed to double the recipe. I'm glad I did because at the end of the night there was only a spoonful left and everyone commented on how yummy they were and kept going back for 2nds 3rds and 4ths!",

My cream cheese was right out of the fridge, so I just put the flame to low and added it in, so that it would melt and combine easier. We really enjoyed these, and I will def be making them again...great way to do something different w/ refried beans! Thanks for sharing. :)",
