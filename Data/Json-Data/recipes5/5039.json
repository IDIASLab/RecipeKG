I added half a yellow onion-- finely diced-- and a small shallot (it was an allium extravaganza!), and I think I used a little more lemon than recommended.  Finished it off with some Frank's Red Hot sauce to taste (the red pepper flakes just didn't quite do it for me), and boom!  Tasty greens.  Really well-rounded flavor.  My boyfriend had seconds!  I will definitely be making this again and possibly apply the lemon-garlic flavor to other more bitter greens (collard, turnip, etc.).",

You can watch their eyes pop out of their head while you silently smirk behind your glass of buttery Chardonnay. \n\nOriginally I found the lemon garlic rainbow chard recipe, and was having a hard time choosing between this and that, so I decided to augment this recipe with a little of that  one.   I  decided to followed this one, but used lemon-infused olive oil instead of EVOO, omitted the onions (they hate me and I wasn't in the mood for a revolt), added a pinch of red pepper flakes, and topped with pine nuts.   I also used Mediterranean style feta because that's what I had.\n\nBetween the feta, oil and pine nuts there are probably 10,000 calories in each bite, but you'll be to blissed out to pay any mind to that.",
