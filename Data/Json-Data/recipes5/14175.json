Delightful attractive and a pleasure to eat asparagus that was neither too crunchy nor cooked to mush. The onions and garlic were great flavor enhancers but to kick it up a notch I saut\u00e9ed some chopped yellow and red bell peppers along with the garlic and onions for additional flavor and garnish. Some halved cherry tomatoes would be nice too! Served this with Pork Tenderloin Diane and Lemon Pepper Pasta recipes also from this site. Hubs declared it a home run dinner perfect to usher in spring.",
