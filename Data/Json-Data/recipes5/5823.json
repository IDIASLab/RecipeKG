I have made enough recipes with lemon to know that all lemons are different. I added the zest of one lemon and tasted the soup. It was \"almost\" perfect. I added just a tablespoon of juice after that and it was perfectly lemony, just how we like it. Also, I just added the uncooked orzo to the soup and let it boil for about 8 minutes. We didn't have any left overs. Anyone that isn't familiar with cooking with orzo should know that it does completely soak up the broth where leftovers are concerned, so if you know you are making more than will be eaten, you should make it on the side and add to each bowl; otherwise, the next day there will not be any liquid in the soup left. Delicious and I will be making this again soon!!",

I found this recipe and it totally nailed the soup!!! I was fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. So delicious, so light, so lemony. I even made some homemade croutons to go on top and shaved a little parmesan on top right before serving. It was a huge hit with the family. The only thing I did differently was I cut up the vegetables smaller cause I don't like big chunks and I cooked the soup in the crock pot. I put in the orzo uncooked and it did not take long for it to get done. I can't say enough good things about this soup!",

I took the advice of another reviewer and used lemon rotisserie chicken...a real time saver. I tossed the spinach in right before serving and just wilted to keep the flavor. This was such a nice light refreshing soup and I actually like it better without the cheese, but the guys loved the cheese. I've never had Panera's soup so can't compare to that, but we all sure enjoyed this and I'll make again. Would be a wonderful soup for someone with a cold.",

For the chicken, I used the remains of a Roast Sticky Chicken - Rotisserie Style which I baked yesterday.  I cooked the orzo in boiling water in the microwave versus boiling on the stove. I also used my own homemade chicken broth. We love all of the spices that were called for in this recipe so they were all included. I sliced the baby spinach into ribbons and sprinkled it, along with the freshly grated Parmesan cheese, over the top of each bowl. This soup would be an excellent soup to share with someone that is under the weather. The aromatic scent of lemon in the broth just puts this soup over the top.
