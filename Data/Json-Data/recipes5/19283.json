Mix the green onions cream cheese and stuff the chicken. Wrap in bacon (as many slices as needed to cover) secure with toothpicks and bake 25-30 minutes. We have also grilled these for about 5 minutes a side and finished off in the oven which has amazing flavor as well. I think these flavors work so well together it illiminates the need for all of the other ingredients listed. Instead of green onions I've also pan seared some priscutto and used that with the cream cheese. It sounds like it may be too much of the bacon flavors but it turned out really well. Enjoy!",

However, as written the chicken is bland and flat, a blank canvas for seasoning of SOME kind. I used Penzey's Chicago Seasoning. The cheese mixture is richly flavorful, really delicious - I used garlic and herb flavored Boursin, omitted the garlic, and used multi colored bell peppers rather than just the red. I used no salt! The bacon was a snap to wrap around the chicken after microwaving it just briefly. I finished the chicken off under the broiler just to brown the bacon a little further, but unfortunately, as others experienced, much of that wonderful cheese mixture had oozed out. I'm not sure how this could be avoided, but it really detracts from the dish.  As long as the cheese is going to ooze out anyway, this might just be better used as a sauce - saute the onions and peppers first, add the cheese and heat until melted. I'd give this dish five stars for its concept and for the combination of flavors, but three stars for lack of seasoning and faulty execution in the method. But even with its flaws hubs and I enjoyed this!",
