I didn't think the recipe called for enough ingredients for the marinade/basting sauce though as it is.  I put just that amount in to toss with the pork and there wasn't any left to baste the kabobs with when they were on the grill so I had to mix up more of that.  You need at least double the recipe I think for the marinade part.  I let the pork pieces sit in marinade about 2 hours before grilling.  I also only used about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes because my 10 year old doesn't like things overly spicy.  Everyone really liked the kabobs and said make it again.  I served this with the Florentine Pasta Salad recipe that is on this site also.  Someone had mentioned the marinade wasn't thick enough, I bought a teriyaki marinade/GLAZE rather than the teriyaki marinade sauce and I didn't have any problems with it not sticking to the meat at all.",
