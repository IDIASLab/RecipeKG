The brown sugar carmelized the chicken on the grill and the result was very nice in both color and flavor.  It went great with rice and veggies!",

The key is to grill on low heat to retain the juices.  This is a simple and quick recipe I will make again and again.  Served with spicy vegetable chow mein and hawaiian rolls.",
