We're big bratwurst fans but I was sick of just grilling them up and serving them on buns with sauerkraut. This will be a new go-to recipe when we want something different. My boyfriend deemed the sauce \"fantastic\" and said he could eat it forever. I don't know if I could eat it \"forever\" but it was REALLY good. I made a couple of minor modifications: only one cup of ketchup instead of two (two cups just seemed like it was going to be way too much) and only two tablespoons of curry since I was worried 3 tablespoons would make the curry flavor overpower all the other spices too much. The only reason this didn't get five stars is that it involved too many dishes for my taste: the skillet the saucepan a bowl and another saucepan for making sauerkraut on the side. (You can see from my other reviews that I prefer dishes with minimal kitchen clean-up afterward!) I have no idea how authentic this is but I think it was a great fall dish.",

Honestly I didn't care for the cinnamon or cloves in the sauce and the tomato paste was a bit overpowering. I made another sauce from this site that called for tomato sauce and it was much better. I refuse to give this a bad rating though because it is hard to know what her original recipe was.
