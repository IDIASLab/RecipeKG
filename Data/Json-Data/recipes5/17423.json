I don't pour in all of the milk at one time when making biscuits bread etc... because some days you need it all and some days you don't depending on the weather. I floured my parchment paper my hands the rolling pin for rolling out the dough and had no problem. When rolling the dough into the roll just use the floured parchment paper to roll and it won't be sticky. After it's rolled you might want to place in the fridge for a few secs to make slicing easy. I didn't use the muffin tins and only cooked half of the log. I made icing by using 1 cup confectionary sugar 1 tbsp vanilla and maybe one tablespoon of milk. (Add slowly until you get the consistancy you like.) Just drizzled it over hot rolls with a spoon and they were beautiful!",

They turned out great and didn't last through the day. The only negative thing about them is they lose the delicate texture several hours after baking.

These taste like Pillsbury cinnamon buns! I was shocked at how easy they really were. Other reviewers have mentioned a problem with the dough being sticky and the dough being too salty-I had none of these problems I followed closely and they came out sinfully good! I added flour until it was the texture where I knew I was able to roll it easily. I would suggest to those add a little less salt next time and be patient with the dough until it is the consistency that you can work with... This is going to become my new \"Holiday Morning Cinnamon Bun\" recipe. I can not tell you how much time this recipe saves compared to your standard yeast roll recipes and is just as good if not better! Thanks a bunch-It's a definite keeper!!! =)",

I added a bit more brown sugar and melted the butter into it before spreading the mixture onto the rolled out dough. Rather than using muffin tins I greased a pie pan and fit them all into it.
