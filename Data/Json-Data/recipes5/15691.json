A serving is a large portion, very flavorful and filling.  Even my picky son LOVED it and asked to have it again tomorrow!  I followed some of the suggestions other reviewers had, such as not using the full pack of taco seasoning because of the high sodium content.  I added rinced black beans, drained whole kernel corn, and I sliced up two medium onions and added it to the mixture.  I threw this together on my lunch break and it cooked on high for about 4 hours and the chicken just fell apart and was so moist and juicy.  I will make this over and over again...no doubt!",
