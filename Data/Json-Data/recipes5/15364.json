I would recommend keeping the lid ON when it's simmering because I noticed too much liquid was evaporating with it halfway covered. This will also thicken up upon cooling.  The only thing that I don't see working is cooking this big batch of stew in a skillet. Use a large stockpot!",

The actual modification was in the procedure I added the lentils and the potatoes last after the beef was cooked to tender fork soft.  I also added one bay leaf to the soup and discarded it at the end. Overall very good soup for this chilly autumn temperatures! Will make it again!",

I'm on a low sodium and fluid restrictions diet so I didn't add salt and used 2 cups of Lino Life low sodium beef broth+1 cup of water. Delicious!!!!",
