After tasting it and deciding I had to do something...I added some salt, pepper and some mixed dried herbs after draining some of the liquid out of it and shredding the chicken. I then let it slow cook for another hour and it was better.  I really think it was the salsa I used and maybe if I had used the fire roasted diced tomatoes that Paula suggested in her review it might have been a lot better.  My suggestion?  Use a really flavorful salsa and the fire roasted tomatoes and you might have a winner.  Thanks Carajeanne for submitting this as it has great potential using the right ingredients.  **Addendum 9-21-14--Because mine turned out extra spicy I added it to some cooked white rice...and...Viola!...it made a great tasting \"Spanish Rice\"!  So, you never know what a difference one ingredient can make!",

My mom had given me a crockpot after she found a really good deal on it so I started asking people for great recipes that could be made in a slow cooker that were not all that unhealthy. A coworker introduced me to the Slow Cooker Salsa Chicken recipe on AllRecipes so I tried it. I have since made the recipe about 20 times, I am absolutely in love with it and I make sure I have all of the ingredients on hand. I have substituted the diced tomatoes with green chilies with plain diced tomatoes if I don\u2019t have the ones with chilies; it still tastes just as good. This is such a super easy recipe to make and there aren\u2019t many ingredients to it. I have used this concoction in burritos, on top of rice and even on top of a salad. It is such a versatile meal that tastes different depending on how you prepare it. I would highly recommend this slow cooker meal to anyone I know and as a matter of a fact I do tell everyone who asks me about a great recipe about this one.",
