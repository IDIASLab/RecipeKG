We like things spicy in this house so we added a few dashes of cayenne to the butter just enough to add a hint of heat. As soon as the nuts come out of the oven get them into a large bowl and pour the butter mixture over the nuts and Todd thoroughly. The nuts will sizzle and soak up the lovely sauce. Spread them back out onto the baking sheet to cool slightly going a little coarse salt over the top. Serve in a nice dish or wooden bowl.",
