Though I discovered that if you put it in the fridge after it does sort of retain it's shape and develops a thin outer crust. Since it was too sweet I ended up using only half of the recipe. Luckily I also made a chocolate cake which was originally just a 1 layer cake with cream cheese frosting. So I decided to cut the cake in layers and used this in between the layers of chocolate cake and added some chopped nuts. Worked well too.",
