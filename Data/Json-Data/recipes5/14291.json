I didn't realize it was for only 2 servings which explains why my sauce wasn't quite enough but the flavors made up for that! The addition I made from another recipe was to pre-sliced then boil a couple red potatoes in salted water then layer them on top of the fish before putting the top layer of sauce. Other changes I made were leaving the fish whole using dried oregano and red onion because of what I had. My three guys all liked it and the pickiest never said anything about the onions. I didn't have capers but I'll be sure to have them next time. I used some of the olive brine as a substitute. The snapper's flavor wasn't great on it's own; I would want to try it with other white-fish maybe cod... Thank you!",
