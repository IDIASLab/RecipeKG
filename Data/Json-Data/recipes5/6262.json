Prepared this recipe as directed but with all the fresh veggies I had in the fridge: broccoli cauliflower and green beans and without a word of a lie... IT WAS PERFECTION! Didn't have lemon zest so subbed in plain old lemon juice. Hubby thought garlic drizzle was too much but then again sometimes salt is too spicy for him so please disregard his opinion in this matter. (Note: if you have a garlic adverse freak in your household hold the garlic drizzle remove their portion add garlic to remaining drizzle to use on remaining portions and enjoy. I'll begrudgingly admit that the lemony roasted veggies are beautiful on their own but VIVA LA GARLIC!)",
