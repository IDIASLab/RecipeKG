I did cook the chicken separately with a little roasted garlic oil and the left-over coconut milk, which kept the chicken amazingly moist.  At first taste, it did seem like something was missing - a little extra lemon peel and ground coriander made it perfect.  I served it on a bed of steamed shredded red cabbage to keep the meal lighter.  Thanks!",

I also added some red chili powder. After this modification, it was nice and spicy and tasted great! ",

I did change a few things due to reviews and lack of certain items. I slivered 4 garlic cloves and browned them in the oil before adding the curry paste. I did double the curry paste and used a hot/spicy curry paste (amazing!) because we love things spicy. I replace all of the lemon ingredients with lime and I think I will continue this. Also some finely shredded carrots make the sauce more visually interesting...just my preference! But definitely going in my recipe-box!!",

I also cooked lo mein noodles and added those in as well towards the very end. I used 2 tsps. of red curry paste and that was plenty spicy (I think the amount of curry paste should really depend on your personal taste) and used dried cilantro and probably more than the recipe but I like cilantro so...
