Although you get a hint of banana bread it s definitely in the background as the cocoa/chocolate is what s upfront in flavor. As the Cook s Notes suggested I did sprinkle some chocolate chips on the top before the brownies went into the oven and that may account for why I didn t taste as much of the banana bread flavor as I would have liked. Regardless these are good brownies with or with the additional chocolate chips and I would make again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
