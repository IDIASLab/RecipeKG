My advice is to make this the day before you want to serve it so it will have a chance to become more solidified. I only had three small Roma tomatoes and wish that I had more. You definately need the tomatoes in this dish. Also do not add any salt whatsoever. Didn't bother with making the fresh mayo though I think it would be terrific with this. Went wonderful with a Chianti.",

I again used tons (maybe 3/4 cup?) chopped fresh basil (YUM!!) instead of dried and used the ready-to-serve Hillshire farm sausage (8 oz of the 16 oz \"U\" link it comes in) to cut down on all the oil & grease cooked sausage would have created. Also did not pre-cook the onions-- I don't think they need it. Tossed 1/2 of a chopped green pepper too and layered each of the main ingredients. Used LOTS of garden tomatoes - more than called for. MAKE SURE you remove the seeds from the tomatoes first!!! The first time I made this it was way too watery. The second time with the seeded tomatoes it came out perfectly! I think allowing a full 30 minutes for it to cool before cutting is important too. DID NOT make the basil mayo \"topping\" for this - blecch! Don't think it needs any sort of topping but is nicely accompanied by a fresh cucumber-dill salad on the side!:-) THANKS!!!",
