Not in the sauce, which tasted wonderful, but in the fact the beans never finished cooking!   I think the bottom line is to follow the advice of a previous reviewer & soak + boil before slow cooking.  The allrecipes site has an advice section, which addresses the issue, I've pasted it below.  \r\n\r\nTime your Seasoning\r\nFor the most part, you can go ahead and add spices, seasonings and aromatics  to your pot o' beans when you start cooking them, but there are a few things that you should never add until the end: salt, and anything acidic, like tomato products, lemon juice, wine and vinegar. Salt will toughen the skins of the beans, and acids can keep beans from ever getting soft. Once your beans are tender, you may add these ingredients to your heart's content.\r\n\r\nI'm coming back to let you know I've tried this recipe again, but soaked the dry beans overnight, simmering in the morning till soft.   Worked beautifully!   I will use this recipe's ratios in the future, but those beans are being cooked first!",

The ACID in the tomatoes prevents the beans from cooking thoroughly.  The radio cook suggested not adding acid ingredients until after the beans are cooked.  I always follow that advice now.",

Then brought beans to a boil and then simmered on low for one hour before putting in crock pot.  Followed reciped exactly, sauce was excellent.  Cooked 4 hours on high and then 2 hours on low.  Beans were perfect.  OH!  to avoid sauce being to watery I put paper towels over the crock pot before putting the lid on to absorb condensation that gathers.  I do that on alot of my slow cooker meals to avoid watery sauces, etc.  Will definetly make again!!!",

I soaked the beans overnight-10 hours and boiled them for 30 min to an an hour so they were soft enough.DO NOT SKIP THE BOILING  or you will be cooking them forever and wondering why they don't get soft. Older beans take longer so if they are fresh 30 min may be enough.  Also do not add salt until cooked it also prevents the beans from getting soft. They were not dry and the ratio of tomato to molasses was perfect.  I gave 4 stars instead of  five because  they are a lttle too sweet because of the ketchup. So next time I pureed a can of tomatoes instead, so a cup of pureed tomatoes and half a cup of ketchup and used half the brown sugar recommended.  They were still sweet but much less so.  If I have it I add a smoked ham hock.  Gives it a delicious smokey taste and the meat just falls off the bone.  My husband doesn't like beans but likes it cooked with a ham hock.   In addition you can cook them for about 5 hours on high if you are in a hurry.",

I coked them on \"high\" for 4 hours until they were moderately tender then added the ketchup and cooked on low for another six hours. I also cut the brown sugar in half since others mentioned it was too sweet. Next time I wouldn't though...because I kind of like mine a little sweet.
