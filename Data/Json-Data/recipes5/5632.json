In this particular salad, they blend perfectly with the creamy feta cheese while balancing out the tang of kalamata olives. You'll convert even the most skeptical eaters who have always turned a nose to the wonderful world of beets with this salad topped with a citrus dressing over a bed of nutty arugula.",

Canned sliced beets shaved off a lot of time and effort. And my wife and cooking partner prepared our favorite lemon vinaigrette which I drizzled over the salads just before serving. Finally I darn near pass out at the sight of feta cheese so bocconcini (little balls of fresh mozzarella) filled in nicely and contributed a certain balance and mellowness to the salad. A delicious attractive and different alternative to the ho-hum tossed green salad.",

When I first made this salad I didn't bother reserving any of the lemon dressing and simply tossed all of the dressing with all of the beets. The salad tasted quite \"lemony\" but very good. It was when I made a second salad the next day using the \"marinated\" beets that I absolutely feel in love with this recipe. The flavours having had time to blend together were absolutely wonderful. My friend who I served the salad to (Day #2 version) said it was \"the best\". This recipe is just excellent I will be making it again very soon!",
