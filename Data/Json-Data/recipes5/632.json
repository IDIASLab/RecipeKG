I've gotten past most of my cravings but I can't seem to shake the craving for one of these biscuits. This is my first attempt to make them. They smell good baking. You can refrigerate any leftover icing for up to 5 days.",

Stevia powder, i wasnt sure if thay meant granulated stevia or powdered stevia. When I search Stevia powder the granulated kind comes up. I use monkfruit sweetener so I was trying to figure out which to use as a replacement. I ended up using granulated in the biscuit and powdered in the glaze and it turned out well.",

I\u2019ll stick to my own biscuit recipe that actually tastes like a biscuit and just add blueberries next time. I also don\u2019t recommend blending the blueberries.
