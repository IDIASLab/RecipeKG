On the whole a great way to do steak though. I used a whole tenderloin instead of sirloins (it was on special) and marinated in the mixture for several hours after mixing everything up right in a gallon-size zip-top bag. I also omitted the salt since there was soy sauce and I was pretty sure it didn't need it. (I was right.) Tasty main dish though - thanks!",
