'Sweat' the cucumbers - peel slice in half _lengthwise_ core and cut halves into 1\" crescents. Toss with a little salt and let pieces sweat in a collandar for a minimum 1 hr. Shake off the sweat (do not rinse it's not salty any more) and queeze out whatever more water you can. Blend this and it will not be runny.",
