Those were the major changes other than ditching the garlic and using some ginger powder. I used my white wine vinegar and 2 T Garam Masala powder.... that's all i had. And...I did not put the oil/butter on top because there was plenty of sauce to cover the fish. It was moist tender and delicious. I hope I didn't change it too much but it turned out great.

I followed the advice and used about half the amount of cayenne pepper and still found it quite spicy (and my husband and I are both fans of very hot/spicy foods). I liked the spiciness but it was definitely intense. I'll probably cut the cayenne pepper even more if I make this again. I couldn't find ginger-garlic paste but it was easy to just add some ginger and garlic to the dish. I also couldn't find the tandoori masala paste so I substituted a bit of garam masala instead.
