This fresh, light, and colorful salad is sure to become a favorite for your family. Chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and parsley combine with a drizzled dressing of lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and mint leaves. Goes great in a pita with falafel, hummus, and tahini, but also works as a side dish with any middle eastern, Greek, or even north African food.",

(7/11)\n--so i made this and immediately ate a big bowl with a panzella cracker.  just super fresh, clean flavors, delicious. i used persian cukes & followed recipe exactly.  while licking the bowl it occured to me that chick peas and some feta would make it spectacular. and that second bowl was indeed. (oh yeah, fresh tomato was the only item i didn't have. i did have a can of muir glen diced toms but decided to wait until i put everything else together.  honestly, i thot it was perfect w/o them. i only drizzled olive oil as well.)",

Took a lot more prep time than I imagined it would - lots of peeling and seeding and chopping. WAY too much olive oil. I would at least halve it and drizzle slowly till you get the consistency you want. Too much salt for my liking too so I will play with that. Nice and refreshing and will definately make again though!! Served in a pita pocket with some cream cheese.",

Don't make ahead though I made the huge mistake of making this the night before and the dressing leached all the liquid out of the tomatoes and cucumbers and it was like soup. When it was fresh it was fabulous. If you want to do anything ahead of time just keep the dressing separate and dress at the last minute. I should have known this but I wasn't thinking. Definitely keep the mint it gives a little something you can't even tell it's mint it just tastes herbal and good.",
