This of course added a bit of moisture to the cookies, even after draining completely, but it didn't really affect the outcome, the cookies were a bit crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Delightful and I will make again.  Everyone was intrigued by the flavor combination.",

We even screwed it up horribly by not draining the pineapple then added more flour to make it not as soupy and in the end we don't know how much of which ingredients we added and they were still very tasty!

I followed the recipe to a T but after I stirred in the flour the mixture was crumbly dry. I went ahead and put in my drained pineapple and butterscotch chips and mixed it up still too dry so I put in a little pineapple juice and mixed then a little more maybe 2-3 T. I didn't measure exactly. Baked them up and they were delicious! Do let them set up a minute before you take them off the cookie sheet. I used cooking spray on my airbake cookie sheets and they came off easily. They are a little on the sweet side. Like another reviewer said they remind you of pineapple upside down cake!",
