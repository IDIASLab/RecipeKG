The dough is truely like glue and adding flour to my hands and work surface didn't help this at all. I ended up using a spoon to pour them pancake-style onto a generous amount of cornmeal (okay, I did use about a 1/4 cup) while using a second spoon to help it along. This worked very well. Despite not being able to hand-form them, they did become English muffins. After letting them rest for 90 minutes before cooking, they were dry on the outside and full of lovely air pockets, like I hoped. They were easy to handle with a spatula and came out crispy outside and the right texture and taste inside. Thank you for a baking success (rare for me).",
