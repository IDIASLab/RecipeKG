I have to admit I was a bit worried about the cumin spice as it can overwhelm most dishes but everything turned out very well. Had minor changes such as using dried herbs (omitting the rosemary as we hate them) to the potatoes. For the pork I used a tiny dash of ground cardamom and used 1/2 teaspoon of the ground ginger. I found out later I had fresh ginger after all...I will use fresh next time. Also I added chopped green onions to the potatoes right before adding the pork because my husband likes green onions on his potatoes then covered with foil to prevent the pork from drying.",
