I think the people that had a problem with flat cookies was that when they melted the butter and sugar, they OVER melted. I actually did mine in the microwave. I did it for 1 min. with the butter, sugar and water and then just wisked until all the butter was melted. Then added the chips, microwaved for 1 more min. and then used a wisk to stir the chips until they were all melted. The batter at that point it still pretty thick, not thin like it would be if everything was much to hot. Make sure to let it cool well! Also, when I chilled the dough, I put it in a rectangular pan and put it in the fridge. Let it cool all the way through! I promise, your cookies won't be flat!\nI WILL make this recipe over and over! My kids and husband ate them all up! ",

The mint just gives it just the right elegant touch that you can serve it to the girls when they come over for coffee. It says 36 Andes mints but you really only need 18 since you cut them in half!! Then after you finish this recipe why not impress everyone by using the rest of the Andes Mints and making \"Thin Mint Crackers.\" They're IDENTICAL to Girl Scout cookies and gives you a reason to buy a big box of Andes! BTW this took me 9 min exactly to cook and I really recommend putting the baking sheet BACK in the fridge after you've placed the mint and swirled so chocolate can set and you can then store in lock n lock container at room temp.",

I used a melon baller and scooped out just enough to fill the scooper level. Mine were a little flat but still soft. I would recommend covering the dough when put into the fridge to chill as the dough got a little dry on the top. I ran out of Andes mints ended up with Junior Mints on the second batch. They are ok. I tried to spread the Junior Mints as I did the Andes mints and they don't spread as well so I just left them sitting on top whole. The cookie was small enough to take a bite and still get half the Junior Mint taste. I definatel will only use Andes mints again and will definately make these cookies throughout the year!

Like other users have stated this recipe makes more than 3 dozen cookies so make sure you have enough mints for the tops! I got 4 dozen generous sized cookies out of this recipe. I substituted a bag of Andes Creme de Menthes pieces and 1 TB cocoa for the semi-sweet chocolate chips. This gave the cookie itself a nice minty taste as well. I was nervous about the consistency of the dough once I was finished mixing it - it was more like brownie batter or drop cookie dough. But I stuck it in the freezer for about 30 mins and it was very easy to work with. These cookies came out perfect. Nice and chewy on the inside crispy on the outside like a good chocolate chip cookie should be. I'll be making these again and again and again.",
