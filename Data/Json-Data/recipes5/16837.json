I used ready-made pie crust and followed recipe using rum but also mixing in 1/2 cup each golden raisins & sweetened dried cranberries. For the top pie crust I used a Linzer cookie cutter to make 1 decorative cutout brushed with milk & baked. After 30 minutes we brushed the top crust with beaten egg & dusted with sanding sugar. Pie was lovely & hubby loved it! Obviously a good recipe with winning results on my first try. Thanks!",

I figured I'd use my deep dish pie pan so I used 4 small apples and the whole 27 ounce jar of mincemeat. After I'd let it chill overnight I discovered that even with the extra filling it was too little for the deeper pan. I used a regular pie pan and it was fine. I'm not sure how it would have worked with only 18 ounces of mince and 2 apples though! I also added about 1/4 cup of flour as the filling had a lot of liquid. It went over surprisingly well. A very tasty pie!",
