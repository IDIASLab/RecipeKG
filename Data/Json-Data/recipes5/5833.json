I cut the chicken into strips rather than chunks.  Didn\u2019t bother with either the lemon juice or cayenne, but did add garlic and fresh sliced cremini mushrooms along with the minced shallots and some chicken broth to the tomatoes, cream and wine.  At the submitter\u2019s encouragement, I used chopped, fresh basil and parsley rather than the tarragon, which I\u2019m no fan of.  Rather than measuring any of the ingredients strictly I simply used them in the amounts that looked right to me, but I think it\u2019s safe to say I probably used about equal parts of my tomato sauce and cream and fairly generous amounts of the chicken broth and wine as well.  I served this over pasta along with a Caesar salad.  Hubs and I really enjoyed this pleasant, homey dish.",

The sauce isn't too flavorful and when ever I make it I add extra cream and chicken also I use lemon pepper and hardly any cayenne pepper. I also use extra tomato if I have any extras available.

It is simply sublime. I served it over mini farfalle pasta (tossed first with EV Olive Oil and butter) with grated Parmesan for sprinkling. This is similar to Alfredo Sauce and the lemon and tomatoes gave it a nice zing. Will definitely be making this often... easy and elegant.",
