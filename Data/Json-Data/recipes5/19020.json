I did the following to help ensure they turned out great:  used a slicer to get a consistently thin chip, lined my pans with foil, used someone else's suggestion to melt the butter in a bag and shake the slices to easily coat them and then with the oven at 400, I made sure to flip them all over after 10 minutes and carefully watched them for those last 10 minutes, pulling out some of the browner ones as needed.  When they came out of the oven, they crisped up so nicely as they continued to bake a little on the pans.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!",
