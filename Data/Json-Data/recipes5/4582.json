Took the advice of KymInNM and left out tomato paste and that of Nuttycat22 and roasted the pecans first and it is divine! I used sea salt on the pecans as they roasted and then used the sea salt from the pan to season the soup when it was done. Thank you for the recipe I will certainly make this again and again!!",

It tasted like tomato-chipotle soup; the pecans added more texture than flavor. I used veg broth and coconut milk (my standard sub for cream); otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I'd probably try this again and use a tomato rather than paste--or omit it altogether. A dried chipotle would add an interesting smokiness.",
