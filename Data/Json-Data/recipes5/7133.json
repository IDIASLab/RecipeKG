I made this recipe this evening and based on the current reviews, made the following modifications. For my liquid, I used 3/4 cup water, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 2T liquid aminos (use soy sauce if preferred). I put the frozen filets in the IP on the steamer rack, then poured the liquid over the fish. I seasoned my salmon with salt and pepper, because it will stick to the wet fish! I cooked it on high pressure for 4 minutes, did natural release for 2 minutes and finished with quick release. I think I could have just done a quick release and been done. The salmon was flavored well and cooked. I served it with the Back Burner Ratatouille from this site and quinoa. Picture uploaded.",

The cauliflower was overcooked so I mashed it, salt and peppered and buttered it and it was good. I've tried for 1/2 hour to submit my beautiful photo but it claims my photo is too big, soooo....",
