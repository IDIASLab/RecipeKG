I made this twice and changed a couple things the second time. - Doubled the recipe as it doesnt make very much. - Halved the chilies as this was super spicy. - Extra water needed to be added. After I added the amount of water and lemon juice that was called for there was no way it would come to a boil. - Needs to be cooked longer. Both times I made this it took about 45-60 minutes after the potatoes were added. Leave yourself time for that!",
