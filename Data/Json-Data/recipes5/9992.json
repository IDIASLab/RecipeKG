I was trying to use fresh green beans, and although the cream of mushroom came out fabulously well, the green beans never cooked all the way and it was watery. So this time I sweated some onions and garlic in a good amount of butter, then I added the green beans and sauteed until good and done. Think canned french cut as an example. This removed a lot of the liquid. I used tongs to move the green beans from my pan to the casserole dish so that there was no excess liquid. But don't throw it away! I used it in the cream of mushroom which I made with heavy cream instead, and used a corn starch/water mixture to thicken. It came out PERFECT! And was sooo good and got plenty of compliments. :)",
