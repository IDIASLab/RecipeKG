After making it last evening I thought to myself that there was some way to improve on what was done. My thought was to make a roux with the liqeur and the peach juice. We had leftovers so this is exactly what we did. Then I reheated the potatoes with the roux that was made. It was so good. Another thing that I'd change next time is the butter. I would not add any butter to this. I feel it is not needed. Bottom Line is I loved it and Thank you so much for sharing.",
