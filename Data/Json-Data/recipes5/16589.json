The dough handled beautifully required no chilling and didn't spread in the oven. They taste wonderful too. The icing recipe included is also good though I had to add more milk to make it go through the decorator without effort. If higher humidity makes the dough sticky (which I doubt will happen with this recipe) you can always roll it between sheets of parchment paper and freeze it. It will be easy to cut almost straight out of the freezer. Works with any roll-out cookie dough. If all else failed you could make drop cookies. Throw out cookie dough? Not in this lifetime!",

The gingerbread dough is very stiff and I used my mixer with the dough hooks to mix. It has a lovely mild taste that is spicy enough for me yet my husband loves these cookies too. It will be a Christmas regular for the rest of my days!!!!!",

I think if you changed the name of the recipe to Christmas Cookie Cutouts you would have a ton of rave reviews- I don't think enough people are finding this gem of a cookie recipe:) Thanks for the new favorite!",

Roll them a bit thinner and cook for the entire recommended time (or maybe even a bit longer) and they're hard enough to make ornaments - just make the holes before you bake!",

I made changes to the spices though because i only used what i had at the moment...i used grated fresh ginger instead of the powdered and changed the nutmeg to freshly ground cloves. The molasses i used was the Billington's Molassess unrefined cane sugar and it worked very well. Great recipe to begin with i can't wait to experiment and just use freshly grated lemon and orange rind in leiu of the spices for a more refreshing taste. Thank you for this recipe!",
