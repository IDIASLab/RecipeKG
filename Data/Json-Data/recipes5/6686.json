The flavors were perfect, a little on the spicy side, and hubby agreed that this was a keeper.",

So taking that into account I believe this to be a pretty good recipe - the tandoori masala definitely transforms the dish into a bright red Indian colour. I will make this again but next time I will add 50% more chicken and possibly use chicken breast instead. I may add a couple of tablespoons of sugar as well.",
