I halved the entire recipe and it made 7 fairly large burgers. Next time I will need to add more seasonings to make it more flavorful but overall I think this is a great bean burger recipe. Especially since I\u2019m technically still a beginner and actually was able to pull this off without problems. Thank you to the contributor.",

I have since cooked them and they are nice and moist on the inside, crunchy delicious on the outside. I did use a beautiful orange bell pepper instead of green. Next time I would only use one tablespoon black pepper. My feeling is people can spice this up to their liking when they eat it. I fed this to my 93 year young client and she loved it!!! I made these and froze them for a quick and easy meal for my daughter to prepare (she is a new mom) and apparently oats are some kind of magical food for new mothers! Next batch I will make for her I will include a qty of brewers yeast (also magical for new mothers). I would personally grind the oats and seeds first, keeping the bowl of the food processor dry, then the wet ingredients. I did add additional ground up oats and the mixture was still very wet - the veggies were very high moisture - but freezing them was great. This was delicious!!!",
