I also used a tea with cinnamon added to it instead of the plain black tea and cooked up dried chickpeas instead of using canned. I found the dish never thickened even with the lid only half on the pot (maybe my ingredients were a bit wetter than the ones in the original recipe). We all ended up adding a bit of yogurt to our plates and that thickened it up a bit plus added the extra bit of sourness the dish was missing.",

(Probably it's better with multiple types of beans anyway.) It's different which is why I was drawn to trying this recipe and I may just make this a regular light meal type dish. FYI: It has quite a kick to it in terms of heat so if you have a delicate palate dial back on the spices. Even if heat doesn't phase you I suggest adding a cooling raita dish to a meal that includes this dish. I used decaf brewed black tea as I knew one of the people eating it is sensitive to caffeine. Very different and very nice!",
