I used fat-free cottage cheese and sugar-free whipped topping. Unfortunately I didn't have any mandarin oranges on hand - and it was fine without. This had 2-3 hours to set but could have used a little more. Enjoy everyone - and thanks for sharing!",

Original review: I used this recipe but kind of combined it with another recipe that I had. I was a little nervous about putting the powdered gelatin in with the other stuff and not actually making the jello per say (ie boiling the water). But it actually turned out really well! I subbed the cottage cheese for 8 oz. of sour cream and added cherries & crushed pineapple. My 3yo is calling this 'shark salad' since we got the other recipe with the cherries and cr. pineapple from the kids section of our local newspaper and the section was about sharks LOL! (: Thanks for the post! My 3yo had like 5 bowls through the day!",
