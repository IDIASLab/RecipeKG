I wouldn't call them \"snaps\" because they are chewy but I prefer chewy cookies so they're perfect. Unlike other reviewers I didn't have a problem with the cookies spreading too much. I used real butter and softened it by smashing it up with a wooden spoon rather than the microwave. That might be why they didn't get super thin in the oven.",

Initially I thought that dropping the dough by 1/2 teaspoon increments wasn't large enough but it definitely is so don't make my mistake and drop by 1 teaspoon increments; this dough spreads quite a bit. I'm going to add some coconut the next time I make these. As written though this is a fabulous recipe! Thanks for sharing it.",

I made one batch and dropped them by full tsp. and those were done in 8. 12 minutes?! Not in my oven that's for sure. Thanks for the recipe there aren't too many cashew cookies on here!",
