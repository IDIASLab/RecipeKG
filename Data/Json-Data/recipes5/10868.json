I was hoping that 1) this would be close to what we grew up on and 2) that it would be phenomenal due to it being one of Chef John's recipes but after all the work to make it (no modifications other than used gluten free AP flour) and the resulting flavor I am disappointed. My husband said he would not want me to make it again and really I don't have any desire to. I served it over GF biscuits (figured toasted bread like in childhood was too plain for a meal that took this long to make). I really don't know what would make it be five stars. I guess I'll keep looking.",
