Aside from the ground mustard I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought 1 Tablespoon of ground mustard would be to strong for the kids,so, I used 1 teaspoon ground mustard & 3/4 teaspoon prepared Dijon mustard and I also used regular white wine instead of cooking wine. I cooked the salmon in my cast iron skillet.  Definitely will make again. Thank you.",
