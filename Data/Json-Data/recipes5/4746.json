My mother used to make this for us when we came back from school or on Sundays for a quick lunch. It is delicious and very refreshing. Serve with some plain yoghurt or curds. If you want the sweet-salty taste, you can also add 1 teaspoon of sugar. My kids like it this way.",

And the rice turned out a little dry for our taste. I used only 3 green peppers and it was enough. And I didn't use cashews. With some modifications it will be a very good recipe. Absolutely easy to make.",
