In fact, my husband just had to share a picture on Twitter of the slices I gave him, because he was very excited about how this tasted.  I used the \"Quick and Easy Pizza Crust\" recipe from this site (with lots of extra herbs in the dough).  I made a few small changes to the toppings that put this beyond 5 stars:  1) Instead of seasoning the BBQ sauce with chipotle chili powder, I spread the sauce and then lightly sprinkled some cayenne pepper and some garlic powder on top.  2)  After the sauce and seasonings, I put an even layer of grated parmesan cheese on top.  3) Then, I put an extra 2T of BBQ sauce on top of the pulled pork layer, b/c I knew it would dry out a bit in the oven. (Don't skip this extra step - it's important!)  4) Sprinkled shredded cheddar on top (b/c pizza doesn't seem right without cheese).  5) Finally, I brushed the outer crust with a mixture of olive oil & garlic powder.  I can't wait to make this recipe again!",

I add pineapple to this pizza but the dill pickles are what really make this pizza very good. I have made this on breadmaker pizza crust dough and also on Focaccia bread cut in half. Both came out very well. The trick to a good pizza with dough is a really hot oven. 500 degrees at 15 minutes is what works well for me. It makes the crust crunchy, which is what we like. If the temp is too low, it is doughy.",

I was searching for something to do with almost a whole pork loin that I cooked too long and was quite dry and here you were! I used a quick homemade pizza crust recipe from this site (which was awesome!) and thinly sliced my pork loin then put some bbq sauce on it and a little water and nuked it to rehydrate it. I did add a little bit of sriracha sauce to my bbq sauce to give it a little bite before spreading it on that delicious Italian seasoned crust and topped with the pork thinly sliced purple onion and red peppers and thin slices of sharp cheddar. It was divine! Hubby wants to try it with pineapple next time! Oh and this looked as beautiful and yummy as it tasted. Including the homemade no rise crust cook time was only about 1 1/2 hours from start to finish. If you read this don't think about it - \"Just Do It\"!",

I have always liked the bbq chicken pizzas so this was a bit too salty to me compared to that. I also couldn't help but miss the cheese on a pizza.
