Instead of rolling in additional coconut roll in powdered sugar - works great and costs less! Also you can leave these out overnight covered with a tea towel to \"dry out\" and they won't be mushy as they are when you first roll them. One more thing...I think these are sweet enough without brown sugar. Great recipe - I was surprised but happy to find a version on this site for comparison!",
