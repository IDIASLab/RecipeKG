I had to make 3 batches of caramel to coat all the popcorn (that's why only 3 stars) I also turned the oven up to 300F this seemed to keep the caramel softer so it coated the popcorn better when stired. My recipe has more corn syrup and is just brought to the boil and no baking soda. My daughter works in a popcprn making store and says they too use baking soda but I don't care for how it make the caramel thicken up so fast I found thios harder to work with. I will make again I likedthe crunch and the family gobbled it all down right to the last kernel. I daught liked it too!",
