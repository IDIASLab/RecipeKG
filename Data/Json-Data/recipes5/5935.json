I couldn't find radishes at the 2 grocery stores I went to and finally found the sumac. It can be bought at Whole Foods. I believe this would be best when vegetables are at their freshest in the summer. Definitely consider if raw peppers are a favorite when making this salad. It made for a quick easy and healthy addition to dinner tonight though.",

I went to get my green pepper and it was not there (who knows? lol) so I had to omit the peppers (I will add them next time but reduce the amount as per the other reviewer). This had a nice fresh flavor which we really enjoyed. I do wish I had the optional olives and feta tho...just to take it a notch further. All in all the family liked it. I will make this again (with all the ingredients lol). Thanks for sharing.:)",

I used only a 1/3 c. of green bell pepper because I find the flavor overwhelming and I didn't have any red bell pepper. I added extra radish for crunchiness. I also didn't have sumac on hand so I just used a dash of Italian seasoning and a spicy seasoned salt and freshly ground pepper. Don't make it in advance if you want it to remain crispy.",
