I didn't add the carrots green beans or peas because my wife doesn't like them however I'll probably add them to my bowl. SHHH LOL. Also I substituted the parsley for a bit of Italian seasoning in the dumplings. When I make it again I'm going to experiment with just rosemary in the dumplings. It's a wonderfully fragrant and delicious recipe either way.",
