I did make one change to the recipe in that I used ham base rather than chicken base but other than that I followed to a T. I'm not a big fan of allspice but once the soup had a chance for all the flavors to meld it was perfect. I served with little pieces of toasted french bread with parmesan cheese broiled on the toast. Take a chance on a new recipe I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one.",

Roasted the parsnips and one large carrot along with four turnips, one onion and one celery root.  Sprinkled first with herbes de provence, along with the oil, salt and pepper.  Sauteed a carrot or two and about six cloves of garlic along with the onion and celery, and used half and half instead of the milk and cream.  Definitely took additional stock to thin it sufficiently.  Finally, seasoned with the ginger and nutmeg, and added some ground cumin and a few squeezes of lemon.  Left out the sugar and other spices.  Garnished with snipped chives.  Altogether, really complex and delicious, not at all bland.  You can really taste the vegetables.  Worth investing in all that produce!",
