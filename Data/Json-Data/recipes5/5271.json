                "reviewBody": "Great easy recipe.  I would suggest a couple of things: 1) I added paprika to the flour mixture. Overall, make sure that you season the flour liberally, this will make a big difference in the taste of your cutlets.  2) Definitely do as others have suggested and dip the cutlets a 2nd time in the flour mixture - this makes for such a great crisp coating, I was amazed. 3) Make sure that you wipe the cutlets dry before coating them.   I had no problem with the coating sticking to the cutlet (I am vegetarian so I used tilapia fillets). I used a non stick frying pan and only turned them one time.  After the cutlets were golden brown I put them into a baking dish in the oven, preheated, at 350 degrees for about 17-20 minutes.  In the meantime I made the sauce and other side dishes.  When the sauce was done I took the cutlets out of the baking dish and served the sauce along side. This way of serving gives you the crisp cutlets and you can customize the amount of sauce to your personal taste.  Try this with tilapia or other white fish fillets as I did, it is great. Thank you for sharing this recipe.",
