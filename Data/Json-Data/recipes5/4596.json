The only thing I felt was missing some heat. To counteract the sweetness of the pineapple I added a small bit of cayenne. I also would have liked a bit more flavor from the sweet chili saice since I love that stuff. next time I'll add a drizzle of that to my wraps.",

I did make a few tiny changes - no green onions on hand so I used vidalia slices and my sweet chili sauce is actually pretty sweet so I added another splash of vinegar and a few dashes of dried red pepper flakes to add the kick. I liked the coleslaw with the cheese in it but for the future might not top the sandwich with another pineapple ring - a tad to sweet for me and made the bread a bit soggy. I will make this again!",
