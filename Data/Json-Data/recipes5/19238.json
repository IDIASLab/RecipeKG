I'm pretty sure that was user error though--my brown sugar was hard as a brick so I had trouble measuring the pieces I sawed off; I just added till I thought it was sweet enough and I don't think I used the full amount. I added some fresh grape juice to the pomegranate (about 15 grapes to six poms) which may have cut the tartness a bit and I used fresh ginger. Nice spicy flavor!",
