A few notes based on other reviews and my subsequent experiences with the recipe: YES - follow package directions for the rice noodles... when I created this recipe I was buying noodles from an Asian market and could not read the text on the package. You can actually even use linguini or fettuccini if you don't have access to rice noodles (not quite as good but this is obviously an Americanized recipe anyway). You do not have to sautee the noodles before tossing them with the sauce -- I too have problems with them sticking to the pan and have pretty much just eliminated this step. Finally when I have it on hand I also substitute lime juice for the lemon though lemon works just fine. A side of shredded cabbage and julienne carrots/cucumbers provides a refreshing break from what can be a heavy dish (especially with all that sauce - but I love it!). Hope that helps!",

                "reviewBody": "OK...too peanut-ty and lacked some depth. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and reduced the peanut butter (I used smooth ground natural with no added salt/sugar) to 3/4 cup and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup but it was still too much. I also used 3 cloves of fresh garlic pressed chili paste instead of cayenne pepper and lime juice instead of lemon. Here's some helpful hints that I will try the next time: don't cook peanut sauce too early...it goes from that nice smooth sauce to a gloppy thick mess that doesn't want to stir through the noodles. Don't skimp on the oil when sauteing the noodles. I'd never made rice noodles before and mine ended up all clumped together (I didn't soak them for a full hour either). Skip adding the extra peanuts. Julienne carrots instead of shredding to add some crunch. Maybe increase the lime juice chili paste and add some fish sauce...give it a try! Thanks Sarah for sharing.",

A few caveats: I used a can of coconut milk in place of the 1 c. milk and only about 1/3 c. brown sugar despite using Adam's natural chunky PB which is not very sweet; I also used Asian chili sauce not cayenne. For veggies I used 1 pkg firm tofu snowpeas onion greens and shredded cabbage. Everything came together so quickly and easily & angel hair pasta was just great with this; we'll be making this recipe again and again in the years to come!",

However I for one don't usually have all of these ingredients on hand. So I've been looking for a recipe that closely approximates the flavors without requiring all of the traditional ingredients. This recipe comes the closest of any that I've tried. It was too sweet (and I only used 1 c. of sugar to begin with!) and I add a bit more lemon juice to give it that tang. Also don't be skimpy with the cayenne; it takes at least 1/4 t. or more to get the right heat. I will definitely make this dish again and I'll probably keep tweaking it. One last thing--this recipe makes an absolutely enormous amount of sauce! We barely used half of it. But it's a good leftover too. =)",
