Also the dough seemed easier to work with after it sat out on the counter for a few minutes. My fondant rolling pin worked best for this dough. I was able to get it thin enough to resemble a store-bought graham cracker. I used the smallest size from my biscuit cutter set to make graham rounds sprinkled them with cinnamon/sugar and baked them for 8 minutes. They came out perfect. Once cooled I scooped a small amount of light whipped topping and made mini sandwiches. They are a great light snack or guiltless dessert.",

I used to make them with McVities Digestive (only whole wheat crackers I was able to find) but the graham cracker crusts are so better with real graham crackers that I will certainly bake a batch any time I need a cracker crust. Thanks for the recipe. P.S.: I rolled the dough after only 4 hours refrigerating and it was really ok. Don't forget to put enough flour on the surface you are rolling the cracker dough though.",

I love the texture that the whole grains add; I used whole grain spelt flour for the whole wheat and King Arthur's White Whole Wheat for the all purpose. I also added a small sprinkle of cinnamon. I rolled them out on a well floured surface with parchment on top and baked them on parchment which worked really well. I cut them out into rounds and got 59 crackers. They're great; not too sweet and very tasty on their own with a bit of orange curd or a homemade marshmallow and a couple chocolate chips!",
