I also added a couple of teaspoons of grated lemon zest along with the parsley at the end.  Really nice, fresh flavor.  For those of you who found this to be bland, adding the garlic & lemon zest really does add a lot of flavor.  Next time I will only make 8 ounces of orzo, as I had a lot left over (I could see it was too much compared to the onion/zucchini mixture - so I left a good bit out, which is fine, because I can use this in another dish.  Maybe a nice orzo salad).  This one's a keeper!",

Although I was reasonably pleased with my results, I do think this recipe is poorly written.  First off, what is the point of putting the cooked and drained orzo in a large saucepan?  Why dirty another pan?  Secondly, my zucchini were done in 8 minutes; they would have turned to mush after 15 minutes.  And the volume of food this recipe produces would surely feed way more than 4 people.  I reduced the amount of orzo significantly, using only about a third of the amount indicated.  I also tossed in a pat of butter when adding the final seasonings.",
