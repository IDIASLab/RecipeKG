I didn't have white wine,and a family member who doesn't like any wine,I had to substitute 1/4 cup of lemon juice with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and marinaded for 1 hr. I made a quick microwave recipe on this site for the hollandaise, ( probably better then packaged anyway!). I coated the chicken with almond flour,and browned it on the skillet first,then placed in a baking dish and topped with frozen asparagus spears. I poured the hollandaise sauce on top and baked in the oven for 25 minutes at 350. Delicious!",
