I also increased the amount of tarragon and dill. My salmon filets were 8 oz and I kept them in the oven for 20 minutes. Because I needed to increase the cooking time I steamed the asparagus separately from the salmon packets. Wonderful. I may just make it for Easter Dinner. I am hosting this year and my brother in law is a chef! This may be my chef worthy meal!",

My husband later requested it as his birthday dinner he liked it that much. The first time I made it I used regular mustard and a small amount of Tabasco for the hot sauce but found it a bit vinegary. I also personally found the asparagus to be a bit undercooked (as did several of the guests). The second time around I used Sriracha hot sauce and it was the perfect flavor for the mayo filling. I also cooked the asparagus separately and wrapped the fillets in phyllo instead of parchment (I was out of paper and had the phyllo on hand). That was a brilliant idea. It worked much the same way as the parchment paper but was edible and provided a nice crunchy texture to the salmon. Definitely something I will do again.",

After reading reviews I made 2 separate packets and cooked the fish in one and the asparagus in the other totally divine and both were done to perfection. The only thing I left out of in the ingredient list was the soy sauce as I do not keep any in the house (never use it too much sodium) and I can not see the difference a 1/2 tsp would be in the overall recipe anyway. Definitely a nice way to serve salmon albiet with the mayo one that shouldn't be served too often as the fat content is high...but a nice treat once in a while:) Thanks for the recipe Lizzie!",
