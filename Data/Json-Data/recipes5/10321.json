I could have probably let it rise longer after shaping it into a loaf but the loaf seemed to be spreading rather than rising and  I was afraid I would de-gas it when I scored the top.  No worries though the loaf really rose nicely in the oven.  Follow the baking directions - a friend of mine who made this decided that the baking time was too long and  took it out too soon - her bread was a little doughy in the center.  This would make excellent bread bowls for chili or stew.  I would expect to get 4 individual sized bread bowls from this recipe.  Thanks Chef John for another 'keeper' recipe.",
