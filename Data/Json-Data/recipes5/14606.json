Kimchi is a fermented dish, the more it ages the better it tastes, likewise with the sugar. Use a persimmon in place of the apple, if you prefer. If you want to serve it the very next day, don't refrigerate.",

I've found in previous kimchi making that red pepper flakes were just fine but you just get that firey red color I was after. I still didn't achieve that and will just add more sambal next time. Overall good recipe and super easy. I will definitely make this again with some minor tweaks to suit my taste.",
