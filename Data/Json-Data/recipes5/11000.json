I doubled the recipe so I would have 24 rolls so I used 6 cups of flour.  (I also doubled all the other ingredients)  The dough never came together like it should it was very dry and hard to mix properly.  I tried adding some warm water but that didn\u2019t do much.  The dough rose the first time but never got elastic and easy to handle so I scrapped  the whole mess.   I wish someone would tell me what I did wrong!  Thanks, Kathy",
