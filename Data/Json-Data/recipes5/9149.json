I didn't have a popover tin, so I used a muffin tin, and found that the amount of batter actually made 12 popovers instead of 6.  so i cut the butter down - 1/4 tsp per muffin tin (12) and reduced the baking time slightly - 15 minutes in 425 degree heat and 10 minutes at 325.  They turned out wonderful, very light and very very fluffy. Excellent with some melted honey. This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper!",

My only advice is do not wait for your butter to get bubbly, mine never did. After two minutes the butter just burned so I had to wash it out and start over. The popovers alone were a little bland, but amazing with the Cinnamon Honey Butter. Do NOT open the oven until it's time to take them out, not even for a quick peek!",

They all popped beautifully without having to leave the ingredients at room temperature.\n\n***UPDATE*** I have made these several times now and I have found that if I heat the milk in the microwave to feel warm to the touch and set the eggs in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes the popovers pop much higher than using cold or room temperature ingredients. I also use these in a popover pan that makes 12 and I set the oven at 425 for 15 mins and 325 for 10 mins. Comes out perfect every time. Also, make sure you mix the flour in last and make sure it is mixed until there are no lumps left. Good luck!",
