The changes I made were to omit the evaporated milk (I was making this with 8oz meat and didn't want to open a whole can for for a couple of tsps) add a heaped tbsp of French Onion soup mix and I put a thick slice of cheese on top at the end so it would melt down nicely. We both really enjoyed this. Thanks so much!",
