I also don't make many meat dishes in a slow cooker because I don't like the mushy texture. I wanted to find a way to use pork chops because they are frequently a good buy and voila - success! I wish these were more visually appealing, they really do taste better than they look! I put the cabbage on the bottom of the slow cooker so that the chops weren't in direct contact with the hot crock for real slow cooking. Then I put half of the onions and half of the apples under the chops and half on top. IMPORTANT NOTE: I THINK THAT THE DRYNESS OTHERS HAVE FOUND MAY BE DUE TO THE TIME GIVEN FOR BROWNING THE CHOPS. Five minutes per side will cook the chops through at that medium high heat. That creates a dry, tough pork chop. Heat the oil over high heat, then brown for about two minutes per side. You only need to create a nice brown sear. They chops will finish cooking in the slow cooker. Add the liquid to the pan and stir to deglaze. You don't want to leave that flavor in the pan. Be sure to use fresh, flavorful spices. I might try a little less vinegar next time and maybe a little more brown sugar. But, with less searing time, this is a good recipe to serve an affordable and tasty meal to your family.",
