I let the chicken marinaded in the sauce for a few hours until I was ready to bake it for dinner. It was so convenient to walk away and get some work done and not think about dinner until eating it! My husband and I like to have extra sauce to go with a side of rice or quinoa. So 2 chicken breasts and half the other ingredients was perfect for the two of us!",

Also I'd shorten the cook time to maybe 40 min and/or take it out immediately so it's less dry. Thanks for sharing!",
