This is remarkably easy and tasty and I have been able to make it work in many variations\u2026so here goes:\n1. Yes, the Hormel/Oscar Meyer Real Bacon is perfect for this.\n2. Swiss is good for the first time, but don\u2019t be afraid to try gouda, cheddar, or any hard cheese you like (add 5-10 min cooking with cheddar).\n3. Don\u2019t leave out the (approx 1/3rd Cup) parmesan/romano cheese even if you\u2019ve changed the swiss, it helps add to the creamy texture of the final product.\n4. Adjust onions to taste; oldest daughter wants none, I want more. Scallions give it a very rich onion flavor and the frozen chopped save time, but fresh Vidalia is best.\n5. I\u2019ve also discovered frozen chopped red/green peppers, these needed to be chopped a bit more finely.\n6. I have found that adding frozen ingredients adds to the cooking time (\u201cduh\u201d).\n7. Add \u00bd tsp of salt & pepper to taste to the eggs and cream.\n8. For vegetarian, I\u2019ve used approx 3 oz of spinach (cooked in 1T water and drained) OR approx 3 oz of frozen broccoli florets instead of bacon.\n9. For just a few cents more, I\u2019ve found the Marie Callendar\u2019s frozen pie crusts to be the best for this.\n10. Right now I am making one with 2 oz frozen broccoli florets AND 2 oz bacon with cheddar cheese & frozen chopped onion.  I let the pie crust, onion, and broccoli sit out of the freezer for 1 hour first\u2026Pefrect!",

Also, use the 2.8 oz. bag of Oscar Mayer bacon PIECES (available near bacon bits- but DON'T USE BACON BITS).  Finally, to make it easier, Ore Ida makes frozen chopped onion (makes everything go quicker to not have to chop onions).  Truth be told, you can use any cheese or other ingredients that you like in your quiche.  It is very versatile! Hope this makes it easier and tastier!!",

I followed all the other posts suggestions as well. I would like to note, though: place foil around the edges of your quiche when you bake it so the crusts don't overbake!!! Make this...it is simple and yummy!!! :)Thanks to the originator!",

Although I like swiss it seems like it's often too strong in quiche so I followed the recipe except used sharp cheddar in place of the swiss. Also I cooked the onion in EVOO (crisp/tender) first. I used an unroll and bake crust layered in the cooked onion cheeses (real shredded parmesan) and bacon pieces before pouring on the eggs as directed. Baked up perfectly and was so tasty I couldn't stop eating it. I plan to add other ingred's in the future - maybe some cooked mushrooms or sundried tomatoes! And it was soooo easy and quick. This will definately be one of my regulars from now on!",
