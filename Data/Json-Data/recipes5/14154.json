We made slight modifications to this recipe because we did not have all the ingredients on hand and we prefer baked chicken. We used fresh serrano peppers instead of dried peppers and added garlic salt in the blender. We put the chicken breasts in a baking dish covered them with the tomatillo salsa and baked covered for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. I underestimated the heat of the serrano peppers but we solved that issue with a little sour cream. Served with a side of Spanish quinoa-brown rice blend this meal was a hit! Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
