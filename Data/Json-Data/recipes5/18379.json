It was simple enough for him to help with with minimal supervision. I did have to cover this with foil about 20 minutes before it came out because it would have scorched if I hadn't. Good contrast against Cha Cha's White Chicken Chili. NOTE: To make your molasses slip easily from your measuring cup, give it a good spritz with your baking spray. Comes clean like whoa.",
