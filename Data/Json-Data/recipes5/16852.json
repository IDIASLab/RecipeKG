I used maple syrup instead of the brown sugar and a very small turnip. I also forgot to put in the margarine and I don't think it mattered. Another thing that impressed me is how easy this recipe was to make. The hardest part was peeling the potatoes! It took less than 30 minutes start to finish which is an accomplishment for me since I'm a beginning cook. I was also pleased that the ingredients weren't expensive. I'll definitely make this soup again and again.",
