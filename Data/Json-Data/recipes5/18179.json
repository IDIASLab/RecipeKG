I kept the bare bones of the recipe the same only using whole wheat flour upping the baking soda to a full teaspoon and adding a teaspoon of baking powder. I used one teaspoon of SD's pumpkin pie spice and organic honey instead of molasses (I just happened to be out at the moment). I did use lowfat buttermilk an organic egg and organic carrots and raisins. I started out with the original amount of carrots raisins and nuts and ended up increasing the chopped carrot to 3/4 of a cup and the raisins and pecans to a half cup FOR A HALF RECIPE. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. We don't like walnuts in this house so I used pecans. Right before baking I sprinkled the muffins with a slight amount of sugar. These turned out almost like carrot cake. I think as a base recipe this is really great but it really does need the extra added stuff. I think had I not increased the additions it would not have turned out as good. NOTE: For a half recipe I got 12 medium sized muffins not 18. 350 for 15 minutes was perfect baking time.",
