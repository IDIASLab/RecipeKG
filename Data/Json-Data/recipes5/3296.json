I dipped each mushroom cap into the melted butter. I accidentally added wine to the stuffing.So,I added the entire 16 oz of crabmeat. I shredded the gruyere and chedder with the other ingredients, & stuffed the mushrooms. I put them in the fridge overnight. I baked them in the white wine, and they were wonderful. However...one day later, I found out something else that makes them even better. \nI baked them in the oven at 400 degrees. I wasn't ready to eat them when they were done, so I left them in the oven, & turned the oven off.2 hrs later I was ready to eat them, but they were cold.I put the pan in the microwave for 2 minutes and re-heated them. \n\nWell...OH MY GOD!!!!! They were incredible...I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I just ate them.It seems that they are best if you bake them, let them cool,then re-heat them just prior to serving them. Adding wine to the stuffing mixture, and marinating overnight makes a difference also. The first time I served them, they were cooked, but the inside portion of the mushrooms were still white, although soft and warm. When I baked them tonight, let them sit, and then re-heated them...I ended up with that really nice soft, brown, totally immersed in butter mushroom through and through...and the crabmeat stuffing really popped.",

I used imitation crab meat, added 3 large cloves of garlic and sauteed in butter with the green onion and added salt, garlic powder & pepper. I also used whole wheat bread chopped up finely. The dill is a must. I usually don't care for dill too much but it was excellent in this dish. Also the Jack Cheese is a MUST! I also used medium size portabello mushrooms and used chicken broth in place of the wine. I also put Monterey Jack on the top and Baked for about 20 minutes then broiled for a few minutes to make the top nice and crispy! mmm thanks!",

I used fresh dill weed from my garden - fresh herbs make such a big difference in the end result! And I added a few dashes of Original Mrs. Dash. I think next time I will not add any cheese to the bread crumb mixture - I'll just put it on top. These turned out wonderful and they were the hit of the party!

Made 30 medium sized mushrooms with this and could've filled another 2 or 3. Next time I make these I'll add some fresh chopped garlic and saute it with the onion for a little extra kick! These are definitely restuarant quality. One suggestion would be to fill the shrooms first then just place them in the melted butter and move 'em around to get them coated otherwise they get too slippery to handle.",

I was surprised at the omission of garlic too, but wanted to try it as written.  The mushrooms turned out delicious even with out bacon, garlic, or all the other ingredients everyone else seems to think they need. The stuffing was easy to make and they looked beautiful when the cheese got golden and bubbly.  The hubby and I fought over the last one!! \n\nSo, maybe next time a sliver of garlic or two, but then again, maybe not. I liked the recipe as written.",
