Cooked bacon with onions & jalape\u00f1o with a little molasses to carmalize.  Also used a combination of cheddar, Colby, jack and cream cheese.  And put crushed potatoe chips on top.  Amazing!

I halved this recipe (as the main dish for two servings) and it was so easy! I made it in my cast iron skillet... melted the butter added the salt (omitted the mustard powder) and per other reviewers I reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups from the listed two cups (half of the recipe.) Added 1 1/2 tablespoons of corn starch to the milk whisked and poured in the skillet. Took less than a minute for it to thicken probably because the skillet was already hot. Added some onion powder and paprika and 1 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar (saving the other 1/2 for the top.) Sprinkled with just a little bit of paprika and put in the oven. Took less than 8 minutes to get ready to go in the oven and only 20 minutes to bake (convection) so super quick! Didn't use any toppings other than the cheese but I plan on making this for Thanksgiving in a bigger stainless steel skillet and I will put the cheese in the middle and surround that with crushed plain potato chips. Sure to be a hit!",
