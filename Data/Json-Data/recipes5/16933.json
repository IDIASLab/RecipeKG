I sauted the onions and apple slices in butter then put them in my crock pot. Next I browned the pork chops in a little butter and cooking spray and put them on top of the apple mixture. I put about 2 cups of chunky applesauce on top of the chops then poured the spices (doubled) and 3/4 cup of apple juice on top. I cooked it on low for about 10 hours. We LOVED the flavor! Some of the reviews said there was no flavor in the meat but using the crock pot let the flavors soak into the meat wonderfully! Try it this way and I'm sure you will agree. Sherry",

I first covered the pork chops in chopped onion minced garlic and pepper and let them season in the refrigerator all afternoon. I came home from work sauteed them in a skilled and transferred them to a baking dish. I placed the apple slices on top and poured my modified sauce. I used orange juice instead of water; added cinnamon as well as cloves; used prepared sweet hot mustard; added more brown sugar and added about 2 tablespoons of flour. I whisked this all together and poured over the top. I then added several baby carrots wherever they would fit in the dish. WONDERFUL! The sauce was thick like gravy sweet and was excellent! Although I don't like baked apples they added some terrific flavor and I would not leave them out. Make some garlic-herb roasted buttered potato chunks and you have a quick meal that can baked while you unwind after a long day at work! Definitely will make again!",

I read through many reviews and these are the tips that I culled which worked great for me. I replaced the water with apple juice (I think cider would taste the best though!) and replaced the cloves with cinammon. I let the pork chops marinate in the mixture all day. Since I was using small boneless pork chops I used a smaller baking dish than was called for so that the marinade was almost to the top of the pork chops. I cooked covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for 20 more (probably could have gone 5 minutes less). During the last 5 minutes I pushed the apples and onions down in the juice to cook. It was a great dish this way. The meat was flavorful and tender and the apples were delicious. I think the onions were something I could do without if I didn't have one. If you're not a huge onion fan skip these - I think you'll enjoy it more! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I also suggest using apple juice instead of water and doubling the spices. I made twice as much sauce (so i quadrupled the spices) in order to cover the thick chops. i used a clove-cinnamon mix and i also added some flour to thicken the sauce. Frenching the bone (removing all of the meat from the end of the bone with the back of a knife) adds a nice touch and the presentation is worth the trouble.",
