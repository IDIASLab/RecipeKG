I ended up with about 8 pounds of pears that were so-so as they were very gritty. The citrus flavor from the orange zest was a bit much so next time I make this I will eliminate it. I did not have any cloves so I used extra allspice and increased all the spices for the additional pears. I increased the lemon juice to almost 1/2 cup. I love the flavor a lot. Next time I make this I hope to have better pears and cloves.",

Followed the instructions to the letter- by the end of max cook time it had the consistency of a very wet and yet chunky sauce. I spent an additional 4 hours simmering to get as close as I could to a fruit butter consistency. It never really got there. It yelided 7 8oz jars. I suspect I am going to tinker with the recipe and try more pears with the same amount or perhaps a tiny more of everything but do it in the slow cooker and see if tweaking it might help. Flavor was great really great but it just doesnt get thick like fruit butter is supposed to do",
