I made it and immediately took it to the party. Having some leftover I put that in the fridge and just had it with chips. The flavor was decidely different. Should I have put it in the fridge overnight? Also I have read the responses and believe that fresh salsa and a bit less chili powder should do the trick. Overall a great dip for us vegans and a potential hit at any party. One other wonderment...think it's better with chips or tortilla skins? Thanks for the recipe; I'll let you all know how 'take 2' works out.",
