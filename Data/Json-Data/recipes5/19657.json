Marinated a 5lb. bone in-pork shoulder in A&W Root Beer for 10 hours, applied rub, wrapped in Saran wrap for 3 hours, seared to perfection and into the crockpot on low for 7 hours. Substitued apple cider vinegar for the whiskey (didn't have any). Piled on a steamed kaiser roll with coleslaw, and I spread microwaved Sweet Baby Rays Hickory bbq sauce on the both sides of the bun like you would other condiments for your favorite burger and it was superb.  You can eat the pork like pot roast too which is why I didn't want to sauce it all up.  The next day it was great used for pork tacos, with fresh cilantro and finely diced onion on a corn pan fried corn or flour tortilla. The kids prefer flour.  Top with your favorite hot sauce and hang on as your taste buds take you for a ride. AWESOME PORK for three totally different dinners!! I might try a little liquid smoke next time as others mentioned just to see if it improves the outcome.",
