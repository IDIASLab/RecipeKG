I only made 1/4 of the recipe, because I wanted a little salad dressing just for this evening. I followed the recipe. I then realized I forgot the garlic and it tasted fine. I used grapeseed oil for the walnut oil and safflower oil for the vegetable which was what I had on hand. For the cranberry sauce I used Trader Joes cranberry sauce with orange. Flavor works for me, just wish it was a little lower in calories. A little goes a long way on a salad though. ty",

                "reviewBody": "I made this dressing to go with my Thanksgiving meal. As another reviewer pointed out it does make a lot (over 2 cups). I blended the ingredients with an immersion blender and that did a fine job of emulsifying the oil. One reviewer said the Dijon overwhelmed the cranberry flavor. That was not my experience but I suspect that might be due to the style/brand of Dijon/cranberry sauce used. I tend to dislike Dijon (too strong) but have found I don't mind the Musette \"traditional\" Dijon. As for the cranberry sauce rather than canned or jellied cranberry sauce I used a Cranberry-Orange Relish that Publix grocery stores sell in their deli around the holidays. The results were a good blend of Dijon and cranberry flavors... but I still felt that this dressing was lacking something in its flavor profile. The recipe as it stands is very heavy on the sour end of the flavor spectrum. Tart cranberry relish (using canned or jellied might well sweeten it up some though) tart Dijon sour vinegars (even rice vinegar is more sour than sweet)... I think this dressing needs something sweet to balance all that sour! I plan to make this again for Christmas but I am going to change it up slightly. I'm going to use jellied cranberry sauce and make it a few days in advance to allow the flavors to develop. At that point I'll see if I need to add some honey for balance. I already know I need to add more salt/pepper. A similar recipe called for 1/4 teaspoon for each so I'll try that.",
