I did tinker a bit with the recipe but nothing drastic. I cut the recipe in 1/2 first. I don't like beef so I use a turkey and sausage mixture for most anything calling for it(1/2 and 1/2) ommitted all peppers used 1 (15 oz.) can Mexican chili beans instead of kidney beans used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and added 1/2 tsp of cumin to the orginal spices. It came out absolutely amazing. Thick a bit spicy (not much b/c I have two small children) and wonderful with Club crackers. No more buying chili in a can for me ever! Thanks so much for the recipe.

They are evil hot! Don't touch your eyes after chopping them. Of course your fingers will be tingling a little after handling them so I doubt you'll forget. Next time I'll reduce the amount of tomato sauce and use a variety of peppers.",
