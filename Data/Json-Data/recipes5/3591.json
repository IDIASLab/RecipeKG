If you read the other reviews that said this didn't \"set\" then they probably made one or both of these mistakes: The blender you use to make the mayonnaise must be COMPLETELY UTTERLY DRY. Only make this recipe if you haven't used your blender for at least a day and it's totally air-dried. Also you must add the oil to the blender at a very very slow drizzle to get the mayonnaise to set up properly. Do these two things and your mayonnaise will come out perfect every time!",

The dijon mustard lemon juice salt & 1/4 t paprika was whisked first then the SLOW (this is absolutely essential--I probably whisked very quickly for 6 minutes or so) process of whisking the oil in which worked great! At the end I put in 1 t horseradish for more bite paprika and 4 cloves of garlic crushed minced and pounded. Tomorrow I will adjust seasonings and strain. mmm! I'm surprised I haven't seen this dip with yam 'fries' which is one of my favourites to order at a restaurant. I dunno what they put in it but I think I'm getting closer! ps if your mayo 'separates' (tastes like yucky oil and is lumpy) don't throw it away! Get a new bowl a new yolk with some seasoning and whisk it. Now pour in (VERY SLOWLY!!!) your ruined mayo very patiently and wha-la!! your mayo comes together beautifully ';-)",

I make it on Thanksgiving to serve over halved scored oven baked potatoes sprinkled with olive oil and paprika. Add this sauce and the potatoes are delightful. My entire family waits anxiously for aioli & potatoes on Thanksgiving...and all are hoping there's some they can take home. I now make each family a container of aioli. I wasn't taught to use the mustard but was taught the egg yolk must be room temperature and to use several cloves garlic...for a \"zip\" in the taste. I was also taught to use a submersive mixer...or whatever that gadget is called...that comes with it's own mixing cup. When made as Puri taught me...this recipe deserves 5 stars. Grandma Pam",

I read all the reviews and suggestions...egg yolk at room temperature add paprika increased raw garlic to 4 cloves. I would add that I would run the garlic thru a press for the most garlic flavor. Also this tastes very different alone as opposed to with food. Don't discount it until you accompany it with shrimp salmon croquettes or crabcakes. Next time I will add chives fresh basil and some herbies too lazy to wander to the garden today: November 1 and 90 degrees in Tucson AZ! Thanks to all for suggestions and LIANNEF for a great recipe! UPDATE: I just made my Salmon Cakes and for the sauce here I doubled this recipe with 2 egg yolks 2 teaspoons of dijon mustard and then added 4 giant cloves of fresh garlic but STILL only put in 1 cup of EVOO. Lemon juice ended up at 1 Tablespoon; I added the 1/2 teaspoon of Giant Kosher Salt Flakes while whipping the Aioli. At the end added Freshly Ground Black Pepper on top to taste a splash of olive oil and toasted pine nuts. YUMMY! No paprika. Enjoy it we keep it in the frig for other seafood for up to 2 weeks.",
