I didn't use a full 2 tsp of salt in the stuffing, I also didn't have currants so I used chopped dried cherries.  Use a thermometer to test the internal temp - my tenderloin was seared stove top and then was done in 20 minutes in the oven.  One thing I really like about this recipe is that it can be completely assembled in advance and cooked later, which is great if you have making this for company.  (If you plan on doing that - take the meat out of the refrigerator about 45 minutes prior to searing & roasting.)  I served this with mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and apple cranberry sauce. **Note: there are usually two tenderloins in each cryovac package.  If preparing both tenderloins, one is most likely going to be smaller than the other.  Adjust cooking time and test the internal temperature of both roasts.   Pork is done at 145 - you can always pull one and let rest while the other one finishes.",

We used curly parsley instead of flat and if I use curly parsley again I might not use 1/2 of a bunch - it seemed like a lot putting it in and while the flavor was great, it overpowered in some bites.  My husband also added 3 sprigs of fresh Rosemary from our garden and it overpowered at times, too - 2, as in the recipe, would be perfect.  Used Panko breadcrumbs to make non-dairy - perhaps will add a little more nex time.  Really good and fairly easy, though!",

Next time I'll use 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. We liked the texture of the stuffing w/ the pork though. Watch the video and make the Dijon sauce! Tasting the sauce alone I didn't like it.
