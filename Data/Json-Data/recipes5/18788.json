I did have to make small adjustments based on what I had on hand - no garlic-chili sauce so I just used 2 cloves of garlic and a tiny bit more red pepper flakes warm water in place of the chicken broth and no salt as the soy sauce added enough saltiness for my tastes. I added about 1/2 tsp. toasted sesame oil and omitted the chicken (will add some leftover from tomorrow night's dinner) and added broccoli and snow peas. A squeeze of lime and this is a perfectly seasoned dish - my only problem is the amount of dressing. I only used half the pasta (whole wheat) since I wanted more veggies and I feel it could use just a little more of this yummy sauce. Next time I will increase that part of the recipe by half and this dish will be perfection in my book.",

I added fresh minced garlic and Thai sweet red chili sauce to the recipe since I did not have garlic-chili sauce. You don't need a food processor for this recipe if you simply warm the soy sauce and chicken broth in the microwave first, which helps to melt the peanut butter. Just whisk them together until smooth. You can therefore make the sauce right in the serving bowl, making clean-up so much faster! I also added some stir-fried broccoli to this dish and next time I might also try water chesnuts for added crunch. Delicious. A definite make-again--next week!",

But when I started to mix it all together I had second thoughts. Turns out at the end it was excellent. My husband and I enjoyed it he even had a 2nd helping. I'm proud to be the first to rate this delicious recipe. BUT I DID MAKE SOME CHANGES sorry... I didn't change anything as far as the ingredients and how much you use. However rather than just pouring the sauce over the cooked chicken and pasta at the very end i cook the chicken then add the veggies until they soften just a little then i add the sauce i made in the blender. I let the sauce cook for maybee a minute or so and then pour over the noodles. Also I don't add the cilantro till the very end. It looses flavor if you cook it.",
