I like that this one is made in the instant pot so I don't have to cook the pasta separately and is thicker. I added some bell pepper and threw in the sundried tomatoes to cook under pressure. I used bowtie pasta. I used 2 large chicken breasts cut up into large chunks and barely sauteed it, and cooked under pressure for only 4 mins. I read the recipe wrong and let it NPR for 5 mins and the chicken ended up tough but that was my fault. I only added half a block of cream cheese because I used heavy cream instead of half and half and felt it was rich enough. This was yummy and my family agreed!",
