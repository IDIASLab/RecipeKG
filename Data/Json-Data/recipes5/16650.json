I came on here to see if there was anything better because mine look like regular cookies in the middle and the nice stuff on the outside.  I didn't have a teaspoon to actually measure so this is probably my problem.  I also didn't use molasses.  After the first batch I took smaller scoops and patted them flatter.  Looking better that way, but I'll try to be more accurate next time.  Also in the same book, it later describes that there is a certain stage after baking where the cook(y)s are soft enough and strong enough to roll around something.  Makes for a very nice presentation; the kind of very special cookie people would look forward to at Christmas time!  Oh and I forgot to add that parchment paper was a lifesaver.  My spatula squished some of the beautiful crispy crumble, but parchment paper made it so simple.",

I followed the recipe exactly but used the parchment paper this time. Oh and instead of stirring all the ingredients together I used a mixer the second time. Made for a prettier cookie. They still look a bit greasy at first but the longer they sit this will go away... if you can wait that long. The crunchy edges are wonderful. With the parchment paper they lift right off the paper...no spatula needed to break the fragile edges. They MUST sit and cool before you remove them from the pan. It only takes 2-5 minutes for the to harden. I wouldn't try these without the parchment paper again. Not a recipe for beginners but as long as you follow the directions and time them just so they are PERFECT! Best cookies ever!",
