Canned clams are cooked and brined to the point that it would take an act of God to change their texture - it really doesn't matter when you add them. If you are expecting a \"sauce\" you won't get it. This recipe is more like a flavor coating for the pasta, clams and mushrooms. I was worried it would be too salty, but I actually ended up having to add salt after tossing the pasta. I also added some nutmeg, which was nice. For reheating, you may want to add a little olive oil for \"cling\". The guys LOVED this; I liked it. Thanks for the recipe!",

As a matter of fact because they are already cooked, brined and canned, they will become less rubbery as they absorb more liquid during the cooking process. One reviewer who as acutally made the recipe states this as well. This is a GOOD recipe! I didn't add mushrooms or fresh parsley (used 1 tsp of dried) and it was FABULoUs!! I also added a bit of kosher salt (1/4 tsp) to the clam sauce as it was cooking and LOTS of salt to the pasta water. It was perfect! Don't expect an alfredo style \"sauce\" that you are going to sop up with bread - that's not what linguine and clams is! If you like REAL linguine and clams -try this recipe and don't be afraid to follow it as written. I will make this again and again - we loved it!",
