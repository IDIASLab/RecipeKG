We cut the head into small florets, and I think it made a big difference because they browned up and got a little crispy on the bottoms.  I can imagine that larger pieces would not roast similarly.

I was running late with dinner and it took forever to cut up the cauliflower. I followed someone's suggestion to cut the flowers smaller and cooked it a little longer. I apologized as I placed it on the table. My daughter took some and said delicious so i tried it too and agreed with her. We both had seconds. I will definitely put this on my to make list. Thanks for a recipe that is both healthy and delicious.",
