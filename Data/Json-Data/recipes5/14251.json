I followed the recipe with two exceptions: I had to sub Pablaneo or Anaheim peppers (my store was out of the Anaheim) and I used pork loin instead of pork shoulder. The veggies were too mushy and the entire thing was too hot. I love hot but this wasn't a good hot. Maybe I didn't roast the veggie properly but this wasn't for us. I've tried one green chili recipe that I liked I'm determined to fine the very best.",
