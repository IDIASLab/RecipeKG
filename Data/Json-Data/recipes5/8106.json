I boiled everything in water instead of chicken broth because I'm trying to cut back on sodium. I don't think it affected the flavor much because this was so good! I made sure to carmelize the onions for a long time and tossed in the chopped garlic during the last 4 mins of cooking the onions rather than boiling the garlic with the other ingredients. I also folded the onions and garlic into the potato mixture rather than spreading them on top. I also felt like the mixture was a little dry when I mashed it in my Kitchen-aide mixer so I tossed in a little rice milk and that did the trick. Ate this with \"incredibly cheesy turkey meatloaf\" from this site and asparagus with lemon. Delicious!! This one will go in the recipe box for sure!",

We didn t just tolerate this or even just like it. This was a real hit for all of us. Fairly even amounts of the potato rutabaga and parsnips ensured that each would contribute to create a new flavor all its own - and oh what a wonderful flavor it was. The icing on the cake was the caramelized onions on the top. What a rich and lovely finish but you MUST let them cook slowly for a good long time until they truly are golden brown and caramelized. I half-heartedly made this as an alternative to mashed potatoes with our roast beef and gravy dinner tonight. While the entire dinner was perfect and delicious this side dish single-handedly took my dinner from JUST delicious to exquisite.",
