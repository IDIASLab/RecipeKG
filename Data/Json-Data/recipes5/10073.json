(it's low fat and lower sodium than soup) I used sauteed fresh mushrooms and also added 3 cloves of garlic to the ground beef while cooking. I used frozen veggies since I think canned ones are really gross! It was really good with some cheese sprinkled on top of the potatoes the last 15 minutes of baking. My husband has requested that I make this once a week! Thanks for the great recipe - even though I tweeked it a bit - I hardly ever stick to an original recipe, though.",

For the filling, I used the ground beef, 2 stalks of celery (chopped), half a small onion (diced), a 15-oz can of kernal corn, a can of 'shrooms, and a couple handfuls of frozen peas. I omitted the celery soup. I did use a can of mushroom soup, plus a splash or three of milk and a few TBS of sour cream. Yum! As recommended by MLTS, I decided to do potatoes on the bottom, then filling, then potatoes on top. Oh, I also used an 8\" square pan for a thick pie, and it was almost overflowing - in fact, I put foil under it in the oven because the filling started to ooze around the potatoes! Very tasty! Thanks for sharing, Sue! Maybe this will convince my husband that Shepherd's Pie isn't horrible!",
