Cream cheese works well too\u2026just choose one or the other. If you need to adjust the consistency, try a little milk. The sugar is pointless \u2013 there\u2019s not enough to make even a slight flavor difference in so many potatoes. The chicken bouillon does make a nice flavor enhancer for potatoes, but if you use it, cut the soy sauce.   ",

You MUST try this potato recipe. I substituted 1/2 TB kosher salt for the soy sauce because I was out but other than that followed to a T using red potatoes. It's creamy flavorful rich but not overwhelming complex but totally familiar. It's the perfect mashed potato dish. Nevermind the other reviews that claim too much is going on.
