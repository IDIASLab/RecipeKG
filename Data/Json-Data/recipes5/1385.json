Not only is there no pie crust to mess with, but I think the vanilla wafer cookies pair even more perfectly with the fruit and custardy pudding. We want the bananas to match the texture of the custard-soaked cookies, so make sure you buy them a week beforehand. Other than that, not much can go wrong with this simple Southern classic.",

Since it is difficult to eat the whole thing in one sitting, I divide it up into 3 Corelle 28oz pasta bowls.  Though these are not rated for the 400 degree temp in the recipe, since the cooking time is so short, I have not had any issues in baking the pudding in them.  The wonderful thing about these bowls is that I have the lids that go on them.  This way, we can eat them over several nights without the bananas going bad. I also have used 1/2 t of banana flavoring in place of the liquor.",
