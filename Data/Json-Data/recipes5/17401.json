I love them along with everyone else. I can't eat frosting so I am one of the few who eat them plain. But we usually frost and decorate most of them and everyone else eats them and loves them. Our recipe I think has a 1/2c sugar in it too though so maybe for the one's who want a little more to it and 1/2c sugar too. But these are more like a tea biscuit not sugar cookie so do NOT expect sugar cookie. But my family makes these for every holiday (we have hundreds of cookie cutters) and for our birthdays every year my mom makes us these instead of cakes (of course no frosting on mine!!) YUM!! Great for dipping in coffee tea or milk or hot coco if you do not frost them. (P.S. frost the flat back side for easier decorating and use the frosting mix of just milk and powder sugar add food coloring).",

They were different from all the other cookies we had and grandma was the only one in the family to make them. I have her old cookie cutters but her recipe can't be found. I tried this recipe and found it to be very close to hers. The cookies were very good but I think I'll add a little more anise next time. I remember helping my grandmother put the colored sugar sprinkles on the cookies just before they went into the oven so many years ago. I'm 57 and grandma has been gone for 4 years now. Thanks for sharing your recipe and bringing back those wonderful memories of grandma's cut-out anise cookies",
