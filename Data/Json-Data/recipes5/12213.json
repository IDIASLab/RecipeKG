I  used my daughter\u2019s which does not quite have the velocity and power as the Vitamix.  Maybe that will help it be a bit smoother in texture.  Also, seasonings need to be upped as well, I found it somewhat bland as written.",

But the texture is off - this didn't puree down to a smooth soup at all, it's very grainy.  I did add more liquid and it still didn't smooth out.  The taste is great, but I definitely wouldn't share this batch with anyone else!  I will try again - the one thing I didn't do was to puree it right after cooking, I ran out of time and pureed it the next day after it was refrigerated.  The other thing I did was used dried beans, soaked overnight, instead of canned.  I will try again when I have time!",
