The second translation I found is from a popular Cantonese homonym that literally means 'swallowing clouds'. If given the choice between eating 'irregularly-shaped pasta', or 'swallowing clouds', I'm going with the clouds every time! You can add ginger, onion, soy, hot pepper, cilantro, lime, lemon grass, etc., to suit your taste and customize the broth.",

I just threw the frozen wontons in the soup and they cooked in no time. This does make more wontons than you will need for the soup, but they keep well in the freezer. I wish I would've watched the video before making them though, b/c I totally shaped them wrong, lol, but it doesn't matter how you shape them, they are wonderful and the pork filling is EXCELLENT. I couldn't find shitake mushrooms at the store, so I just used an 8oz. pkg. of sliced white mushrooms, and that was great for us. Also, I didn't have anything to do w/ the rest of the carton on chicken broth, so I just added it in the soup, as well. This was simple to make, super light and fresh tasting...a definite keeper~YUM!, YUM! YUM!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Brought to a boil, added wontons, snap peas and cilantro. Cooked for the 5 minutes. Make sure to added snap peas last if you like them crisp. My family loved it! Son had 3 bowls. Will make again!",
