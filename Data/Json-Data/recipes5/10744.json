I didn't have smoked paprika on hand so I combined a little bit of chipotle chili powder with regular paprika. Followed the rest of the instructions until the pan frying. The reserved pork fat didn't work out for me - too much liquid in the fat and a LOT of splattering. So I used refined coconut oil instead. Wowza! Amazing! Crispy outside and with that luscious melt-in-your-mouth fat inside. I served it on a simple arugula salad with drizzled olive oil, sea salt and cracked pepper. I just got another pork belly in my farm share and I can't wait to make this again!",
