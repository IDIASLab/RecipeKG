Added just about 8-10 tiny cubes of mozzarella and about 2 tbs of crumbled Feta cheese just before serving.  Substitutes were for on hand availability/savings.  It was absolutely fantastic.  I approximated all measures and adjusted for taste, I ended up adding more half and half to reduce the excessive lemon juice I had over squeezed from a half of lemon. I hope I can duplicate it next time, All four of us really enjoyed it and I will do this again soon.  My compliments to the contributor of this recipe.   I also made a bruscietta brushed with EVOO, using some of the pan fried shrimp, mozzarella, sliced baked/dried tomato slices, red peppers and garlic to go along with it.       ",

I used WAY more garlic than called for (we just love garlic around here) and I used fat-free half and half (thanks Linda) instead of cream.  I stirred about a tablespoon of flour into the half and half and that was all I needed to thicken the sauce.  The lemon seemed to disappear into the sauce, so I squeezed a bit more in at the end of cooking.  I served this over whole grain linguine (which looked awful in the package, but came out okay).  I took the leftovers to work for lunch.  Very good recipe, DonnaT.  Thank you.",
