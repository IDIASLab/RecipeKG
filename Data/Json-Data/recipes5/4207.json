I used canned cannellini (a.k.a white kidney) beans instead of dried simply to save time so I skipped the first two steps until it came time to add the pork. I cut the roast into large cubes and rubbed with my own version of all-purpose spice mix then browned and placed in the pot with the simmering beans. Next I sliced button mushrooms (was on a tight budget...) along an onion and let it cook down then added the garlic and rosemary. Tossed that into the pot. I didn't steam the fennel or artichokes- Fresh artichokes were unavailable the canned ones were costly so I opted to use the marinated kind which I rinsed thoroughly and diced. Also diced the fennel cooked it down a bit in the skillet then added both veggies to the both. Made the garlic-chili oil then added to the pot (I went a little crazy with flakes so it came out a bit too spicy next time I'll stick to what the recipe asks for). I didn't have any wine but opted to use some Ouzo to replace it as it is an an excellent pairing with fennel (due to the licorice flavour they both share) and chose this moment to add that and the lemon juice to the pot and let it all cook for 2 hours on low. I made the topping described subbing some of the parsley for fennel fronds. It seemed quite soup-y not like a stir-fry as described in the heading of the recipe. So I added 1/2 cup of pearl barley and it thickened nicely. Served with biscuits.",
