Instead of waiting to add the wine I just threw the wine in together w/ the rest of the ingredients and simmered it for about 1/2 an hour. It was less heady that way and could accommodate even the worst of red wines. Also I put in entire orange wedges instead of orange rinds. Although I adjusted the water sugar and fruit juice for having only 3 cups of wine (thanks to the reviewer who said that 1 bottle = 3 cups) I kept the same amount of spices and oranges and left out the salt. Next time I'd add even less sugar. It was a tad on the sweet side for me.",
