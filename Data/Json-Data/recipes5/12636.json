Once that was set up, I proceeded with this recipe, and spread it over the dark layer (an offset spatula works great here!).  When you break it, it looks quite similar to a candy that is sold by a national kitchen chain...and it's so much cheaper to make it at home!Thanks for a treat that everyone loves!\n\n** Update ** Made this again, and have another tip!  Put the crushed peppermint into a strainer, and shake the finest particles into the white chocolate.  Then, reserve the bigger chunks to place on top of the white chocolate, for more texture, and professional appearance.  Wow!  Beautiful...just beautiful!",

I melted the semi-sweet choc and spread it on as the bottom layer, then put it in the freezer to harden while I melted the white choc and crushed the mints.  I used 30 Starlight mints instead of candy canes.  I crushed half of the mints into a fine powder that I mixed into the melted white chocolate before spreading it as the top layer.  I crushed the other half of the mints more coarsely and sprinkled them over the top.  Tastes great!",

I only melted one pound of chocolate at a time.  I crushed 4 regular size candy canes and mixed them in the cocolate and then spread it on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.  It works best if it is spread thin, not too thick.  Then I had one candy cane crushed to a fine powder that I sprinkled on top while it was still warm, this made them shimmer and look so much more appealing.

All of the peppermint \"dust\" gets stirred into the melted chocolate to flavor it. After it is poured into the pan sprinkle the bigger pieces on top. It looks really pretty! I also like to drop a few spoons full of melted milk chocolate (or semi-sweet if you prefer)into the white chocolate after it is poured into the pan them swirl it with a knife and and sprinkle pieces of peppermint on top. It looks like the Peppermint Bark that you buy in specialty shops!",
