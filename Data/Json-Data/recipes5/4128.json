I took the previous reviewers advice and used 3 large frozen bananas (When I freeze bananas I usually freeze three in a freezer bag at a time.) but instead of greek yogurt I used FF plain yogurt and added just a little vanilla flavoring. I happened to be out of lemons or lemon juice at the moment but I did have an orange so I used a little fresh orange juice and a little orange zest. I followed the directions as to how to prepare it only at the second freezing time I poured the liquid into Snack Cup containers I'd cleaned and saved and stuck them into the freezer for an hour then stuck the popsicle sticks into them and let them freeze the rest of the way. Great way for me to portion control and very low in calories and sugar plus it's a way to use up the bananas that ripen too quickly that I just stick in bags in the freezer.",

I guess I had a happy accident because I was able to enjoy this in ice cream form within 5 minutes. I used ripe bananas that I had frozen previously Oikos Greek yogurt with honey on the bottom (I left out additional honey) 1 TBSP lemonade instead of lemon juice thinking it would be too sour. I mashed it all up with a potato masher because I didn't want to bother with more dishes. Minutes later it looked too good to put away in the freezer. Very tasty and amazingly fast to pull together. I had a cup of \"ice cream\" right then and there and put the rest in ice cube trays with toothpicks for popsicles later. I will be making it again this way!",

Greek yogurt is very similar in consistency and taste to sour cream so if you are expecting this to takste like a sweet yogurt dish you might be disappointed. It will also depend on the sweetness of your bananas as well. I tasted it after blending then added a tad more honey to make it a bit sweeter. I also tossed in a splash of amaretto to hopefully address the hardness of the dessert. We'll see if that works but after freezing it for 20 min in my ice cream maker I found this stuff to be delicious and the consistency of soft serve ice cream! Thanks for the recipe!",
