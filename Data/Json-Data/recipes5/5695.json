It IS very thick - it\u2019s possibly because even after buying 2 regular sized herb containers at Trader Joe\u2019s of basil it still wasn\u2019t the full amount called for, but since others have said it was thick it may not make a difference adding more basil. You can thin it with water not just oil. Believe me - there\u2019s so much fat in this, it\u2019s not going to lose it\u2019s richness by watering it down incrementally until you reach the desired effect. This was an expensive dish to make due to the cost of the pine nuts, cheese and the herbs - next time I\u2019ll try with almonds. We left it fairly thick. We served it over pasta with sun dried tomatoes and chicken.  The next day it was spread on sandwiches of sliced tomatoes and melted mozzarella - yum.",
