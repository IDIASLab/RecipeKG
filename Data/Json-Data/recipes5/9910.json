I ended up with a lot of leftover tomato gravy, so I will reduce the amount  of tomatoes next time. I didn\u2019t read the instructions closely enough.  I saw \"atural-pressure release\" in step #6 and stopped there.   To me, that means don\u2019t open the lid until the valve drops on its own.  After waiting 30 minutes for the valve to drop,  I just released the remaining pressure which was just about none. Meanwhile, my  cooked potatoes were sitting on the stove in warm water waiting to be mashed\u2026didn\u2019t think it would take 30 minutes for the valve to drop.  So warm mashed potatoes instead of hot, but that\u2019s OK, just spooned on some of the hot tomato gravy.  When I looked more closely at the recipe, it says to use the \u201cnatural-release method\u201d for 5 minutes, and then release remaining pressure using the \u201cquick-release method,\u201d about 5 minutes.  I think the recipe submitter intended for one to wait 5 minutes, and then use the quick-release method.   I have to wonder if something was changed in the editing process, but in the future, I\u2019ll wait for 5 minutes, and then release the pressure.  Sorry, step #6 is just confusing to me.  On the positive side, the beef was very tender, the tomato sauce/gravy (those Italian tomatoes are important) was tasty, and we really enjoyed this.",
