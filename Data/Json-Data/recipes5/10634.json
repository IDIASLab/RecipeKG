I couldn't find any sole so I bought 12 oz of flounder. My fillets were maybe a bit bigger than sole so it made 4 nice sized rolls. I tried to follow the recipe exactly but I used normal italian bread crumbs because I didn't have any panko. Also I used canned crab which I hated to do but it worked out fine. Because my rolls were a bit larger I cooked them for around 25 mins. The seasonings for this recipe was delicious. I was afraid of mixing fish poblano peppers and cayanne pepper but it tasted great. Just a tiny bit of heat but certainly not too much. The mayo mixture kept the fish very moist. Next time I'll do everything the same but will try to find fresh crabmeat.",

I used minced red bell pepper in place of the plobano because it's what I had on hand. I skipped the last step of piping the mayo mixture on top to save time and just lightly doppled it on. Those were the only changes. We are trying to eat more fish these days and need new and different ways to eat it. If you are lucky enough to live near a Trader Joe's they stock Dover Sole in the freezer section. I do imagine that this recipe would work with other fish as well.

I didn't change a thing except that I didn't have any Poblano peppers and used marinated jalapenos instead. It added an extra dimension of heat due to the fact that the peppers were marinated and were thus stronger so if you like less heat use the fresh Poblanos. I doubled the recipe so the cook time needed to be about 5 or so minutes longer. I recommend to keep checking it towards the end to make sure they are not drying out. Enjoy!",
