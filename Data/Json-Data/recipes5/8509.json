They don't expand in the oven so go ahead and fill them all the way to the top like it says. I baked them for 6 minutes cooled slightly then chilled them. They were ready within an hour of being put into the fridge but I left them overnight anyway. To fancy them up I added some lime zest to the top along with a couple lemon balm leaves from my garden.
