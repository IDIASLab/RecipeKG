Enjoy the complex and satisfying mix of garlic and chili pepper, with just a tinge of sweetness. These are great for appetizers, a light lunch with salad, or even for brunch! The sweet potatoes can be replaced with a winter squash, such as buttercup. Serve them warm, plain, or topped with maple syrup or a fruit chutney.",

I followed the recipe completely EXCEPT I found the mixture to be too wet and in reading some of the comments I figured it would have the same problem of falling apart that others had ran into. To fix this I added 1egg and around 1/4 cup of flour to give it a little body. They fried to a perfect golden color. The outside was perfectly crispy and the inside was still creamy and amazing! Even the hubby says they were a 5 star! We will definitely be having these again!",

Also I have never made this type of \"cake\" before and they didn't hold their shape as well as I would have liked. Not sure if there is a trick to it or not or if it just takes practice. They didn't completely fall apart. All in all a great recipe and I plan on making again. Thank you!",

It worked pretty well didn't crumble as much but they did absorb all the oil and did not form a crust the way I would have wanted to. I skipped the jalape\u00f1o. I was also a bit confused about what sauce to serve this with so I served them plain but they were a bit dry for my taste might try some tomato sauce next time; might also try adding an egg to see if they brown better and using less sugar to make them more savory.
