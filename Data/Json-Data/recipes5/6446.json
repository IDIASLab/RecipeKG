I ended up adding another 1/4 cup of blueberries which helped a lot. I'd recommend doubling the berries, and only using 1/4-1/3 cup of vinegar. I also found this needed some salt and a touch of fresh black pepper. With the changes, it was delicious! I served this over a simple spinach salad topped with blueberries, sliced strawberries and sliced almonds. Thank you EvilJekyll!",

The reason why I gave it 4 stars was my own error because I believe I may have added too much vinegar! I added a teaspoon of honey to bring down the vinegar taste I also cut the ingredients by half because I'm a single person who lives alone so there's no sense in making so much food. It does seem a bit on the early side but again I've never made dressing before and this one seemed like something simple and tasty and it sure is! I will definitely be making this in the future",
