I used the entire egg, also cut the recipe in 1/2 bc I only had1 lb of turkey. added cheese, put in 1/2 of the green ench sauce in the mix and topped the rest before putting in oven. small onion, garlic, rotel tomato sauce, cilantro, fresh thyme and oregano, canned mushrooms, and I used the homemade taco seasoning from this website as well. Really good, I cooked for about 1 hour at 350 and I had left overs from a family of 4. It was a huge loaf bc of all of the additions and it was sooo moist. I am def making this again! Thanks!",

But crumbled too much.\" I'm normally a meatloaf purist with just the basic ingredients so this was a fun change. Had to halve the recipe having only 1 lb. ground turkey but stuck w/ everything else as directed in the recipe. (Mine was more like 350 deg. for a little over an hr.) I used a mild enchilada sauce which turned out to still have a little kick to it so I had to scrap and salvage the sauce-less loaf bites for my little one. Husband and I agreed that since it was kinda fall-apartey that we would've eaten it in a tortilla w/ some melted cheese and been happier that way than trying to slice and serve it like a traditional meatloaf. Still muy delicioso!",
