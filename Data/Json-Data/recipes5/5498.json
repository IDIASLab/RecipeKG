I've been changing it over the years, and now I call it my own. When we started dating back in 1997, my husband would every now and then order shrimp scampi at a restaurant and always regret it afterwards, saying none of them competed with mine. You can vary the amounts of some of the ingredients, like the cayenne and garlic, to suit your taste. That's what I've done here because we like spicy and garlicky. Yum! Serve over angel hair pasta or any pasta of your choosing.",

I did use all of the ingredients as listed (except for omitting the cayenne entirely), but changed the execution of the recipe. Most important, I did not cook the shrimp first!  Shrimp cooks so quickly that I knew not only was this unnecessary, it might even be detrimental.   I poured a mix of melted butter and lemon juice in the bottom of my pan.  I mixed up the bread crumbs with enough olive oil to moisten them, and added the minced garlic, chopped parsley, and some salt and pepper.  Coated the shrimp with this mixture, then baked it at 400 degrees for 12 minutes.   Beautiful and excellent!  I served this with Lemon Butter Herb  Pasta and Garlic Vegetable Saut\u00e9, both recipes also from this site.  Five stars with the above-mentioned changes.",

Make it for someone you love and they will think you are a great cook! Oh yeah, i did cut down on the cayenne pepper as other people said it was too spicey. Also, I did not cook the shrimp beforehand, and just kept the dish in the oven for longer than what it called for. This time I used the exact amount of cayenne, for the kick.
