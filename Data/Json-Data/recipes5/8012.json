As some of the other reviewers said it is a thin sauce so I thickened it with a flour/water mixture for a truer \"Alfredo\" texture. We served this with a side vegetable and a salad so we left out the asparagus but it still tasted very good. My daughter begged for the leftovers for lunch today and it tasted even better - definitely making this again.",

I used what I had on hand: fresh linguine steamed broccoli and a can of navy beans. To make the sauce I gently sauteed the garlic in olive oil and then added the beans which I did not drain all the way. The beans tasted nothing like alfredo and they were pretty bland so I added a bit of curry and lemon juice to the beans as they warmed. I did not like the sound of adding milk so I incorporated a bit of the pasta water instead.",
