I doubled the recipe and was a bit short on brown sugar so had to use a cup of white sugar which may have made it slightly sweeter than actual Kahlua but still good! I also used an extra 1/2 cup of ground coffee because I like a strong coffee flavor. Makes a very tasty White Russian and makes great gifts! My friends were very impressed and it saved me money on Christmas shopping especially since I got a decent bottle of vodka on sale!",
