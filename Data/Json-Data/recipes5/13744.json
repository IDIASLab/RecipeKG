This was way better and much tastier. \n \nHere is what I did:  Bring the water to a boil, and drop your onions in,  skins and all, let them boil for 1-2 min., drain them. Then, you cut them,  by doing it this way, it is much easier.  \nFar as the white sauce goes, equal amounts of butter and flour, combine the milk with the cooking water. I did it a cup at a time. 1 C. of cooking water mixed with 1 C. of milk, pour that in gradually. \nThe spices I used were salt and pepper to taste, and Paprika. \nOn any spice, you can always add more of it at the end, so go sparingly while in the pan. Paprika is a great spice, a nice hint of color, and a great taste too. \nMy husband and I loved this dish, he's never had them before and he enjoyed this. \nWill definitely be making this again. Thanks Ibby! Really enjoyed it.  ",

I make the Wondra White sauce and add a little mild cheddar and dry mustard. Put the onions in a casserole dish pour the sauce on top and sprinkle a light layer of bread crumbs.
