We shared 20 pounds of the cooked meat, served with garlic mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables and cresesnt rolls to 36 of our fellow VFW and American Legion members for a recent K.C. Chiefs' football game! Many responses were \"the best pork roast they have ever had....\" \"Wonderful\" nd \"Succulent\" is VERY understated! It was the talk of the weekend and past week! Many have requested the receipe from us. The cherries really add to the flavor and color of the roast! SO VERY EASY! YUMMY!",
