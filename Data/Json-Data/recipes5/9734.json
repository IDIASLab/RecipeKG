        "description": "Make good use of your leftover dark meat without the fuss of boiling the carcass. Simply pick through the carcass before you toss the bird and save the meat for a quick next-day soup. Serve with warm bread for a great hot meal on a cold winter day. I substitute fresh herbs wherever possible, but for a quick meal after the intense preparation of a whole turkey, dried herbs do nicely. If you don't have chipotle chili powder, regular chili powder can be substituted. The chipotle provides a very light smoky flavor in the background. White meat can be used, but your broth will be less flavorful. Leftovers freeze well. Use whatever type pasta you prefer.",

I also doubled the recipe so now have many smaller containers in the freezer for future lunches/dinners. Subs: Did not have summer savory so used oregano. Did not have regular chipotle powder so used McCormick Chipotle & Roasted Garlic grill blend. Did not have sherry so used dry white wine I simmered the turkey carcass all night so had decent stock but I also added some Kitchen Stock and water. I definitely agree with the earlier poster about sauteing the veg's in butter and then simmer in broth/stock. The tip from me: if you can find them use noodles from essenhaus.com. My local small grocer carries them (for their soup) and they are best egg noodles I've ever eaten. Thanks Tonya for sharing this wonderful recipe.",
