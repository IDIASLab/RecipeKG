I made this recipe and it was a HIT! I had so many people asking for the recipe for it. I agree with a previous reviewer in that the sauce is too runny to layer over the top. I just mixed it all together. I also substituted canned mandarin oranges for the oranges in the recipe and walnuts instead of hazelnuts. Also I live in a small town and was unable to find \"vanilla sugar\". In fact I've never even heard of it. So to compensate I added 1 more T of powdered sugar and then a T. of vanilla extract. An excellent recipe! I can see making this over and over again. My 2 year old neice refused to eat anything else once she tasted this salad.;)",

I make some variations - even though this is the exact same recipe that was given to me from my sister. My version omits the orange in the fruit mixture. I also use canned pineapple tidbits instead of the crushed pineapples - as I find it is more of the same shape as the apples. I keep the strawberry sauce the same. I changes the crunchy topping - as I did not like the nutty taste. I use homemade granola. It lasts longer and doesn't get as soggy as quickly. I have even made 1/2 of this recipe and it still makes a a lot. I like to chop up the apples before my guests come place it in a container and sprinkle about 1/3 cup of orange juice on top of the apples - so the apples will not turn brown. I also layer mine a little differently. I use a clear trifle bowl and pour 1/2 the mixed apples on the bottom them 1/2 the can drain pineapple tidbits 1/2 the strawberry sauce about 1 1/2 -2 cups granola and then layer everything again - ending with the granola on the top.",
