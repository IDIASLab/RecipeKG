She never could recall the recipe and we talk about it every so often now that our Mom has passed.  This caught my eye, and I could tell it was the same from what flavors I remembered tasting as a kid. Except for the cherries.  THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH for bringing a wonderful memory back to life!!

One of the reviewers had mentioned it was very runny... i have had this problem to once before but figured out that the whip cream truly has to be completely thawed out. If it is frozen still at all when you mix the ingredients you will end up with what i fondly refer to as hawaiian soup! And no matter how long you keep it in the fridge at that point it will never firm up. so make sure that the whip cream is totally thawed out and you shouldn't have any problems!",
