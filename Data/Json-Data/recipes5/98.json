They released during the pressure cook and became a wonderful part of the sauce.  We forgot to add the cornstarch before pressure cooking, so added it after and it thickened up just fine.  I added more lemon juice than it called for and a bit of white wine.  We served it over noodles and used fresh bread to mop up the sauce. \nOther enhancements we didn't try but will at some point:  add capers, parsley, and a bit more garlic to make it closer to a picatta.  \nThis will definitely be on our \"make again\" list (again and again and again!!).",

I will make it again, such a time saver for me to make a meat & potatoes kind of meal without a lot of time left in the day. We do NOT like the adding of Italian seasoning. It was way too heavy and don't feel it belongs in a chicken dish like this. Hubby was not too impressed so next time I will omit that entirely. He's pretty easy to please so I know it wasn't to his liking when he doesn't go back for seconds and picks at it.. but I didn't care for it either. Leftovers we were hoping for got tossed out this time around. I feel the consistency and ease of making this was wonderful, but it would have been 5-star perfect if I would have omitted the Italian seasoning. Leave that for the tomato based/spaghetti or pizza recipes.",
