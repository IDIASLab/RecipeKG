I did end up adding some chicken bouillon, Italian seasoning, and a little crushed red pepper flakes at the end after having followed the instructions exactly to up the flavor.  If I were to make this soup in the future I'd definitely use spinach rather than kale, but that's just a personal preference.  The whole family enjoyed this one!",

I added two more cups of chicken broth I used 2/3 of a pound of chicken sausage and 2/3 of a cup of half-and-half. I also use mild sausage instead of hot and spicy for the kiddos. Personally I would not add the half-and-half next time. Not because it was too thick but because I personally love clear broth soup.",
