                "reviewBody": "This was quick and easy and good.  I chop the sweet potatoes (with the skin still on) into 2\" thick circles, and then cut the circles in half, before boiling them in an enormous stockpot-- this makes the boiling time really fast.  After they are boiled, the skin practically falls off, which saves you the effort of peeling them beforehand.  Based on the reviews, I reduced the butter and sugar all the way down to 1/4 cup margarine and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  The Thanksgiving guests said it was perfect that way, but no one had a super sweet tooth.  Personally, I will try 1/2 cup margarine and maybe 3/4 cup sugar next time as I felt the reduced version was too healthy and not decadent enough.  :)  Although chunks are good, the potatoes should still be mashed a little bit while you stir them into the sauce.  If you have too big chunks the butter/sugar will not penetrate the center of the chunk.  Did anyone notice that this recipe is very similar to making rice krispie treats-- except you don't add sugar when making rice krispie treats?\n***Update*** I've made this every year for Thanksgiving, and it is always a hit.  Definitely go with 1/2 cup salted butter (NOT margarine!) and 3/4 cup brown sugar.",

Even though I reduced much of the brown sugar, this was very sweet. Here is  how I modified the recipe. .....\n\n4 pounds of yams,\n1/4 cup of butter (salted),\n1/2 cup brown sugar,\n3 cups of miniature marshmallows, divided,\n1/2 tsp vanilla,\n1/4 tsp cinnamon,\n1/8 tsp nutmeg.\n\n .....  Many people claim baked potatoes provide the best taste and texture. So, I baked the cleaned yams for 45 minutes in a 350 F degree oven. After removing the yams and letting them cool, I peeled the yams, and mashed them. Then I folded the marshmallow/sugar mixture into the yams. Once mixed, I placed the mix in a baking dish, let them bake for approx 30 minutes at 350F degrees. After 30 minutes, I placed the mini marshmallows on top of the dish and let bake another 5 minutes. Just long enough for the marshmallows to puff and get a touch golden.",

Also we like our potatoes a bit chunky so I will cube them before boiling and then mix them with the sauce before putting into the oven instead of mashing them.
