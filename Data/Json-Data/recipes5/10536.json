The texture of the potatoes was crispy, creamy & yummy.  I didn't think these were too time consuming, considering the professional result.  Served as a side dish to BBQ NY Strip (also on this site).  Can't wait to make these again with fresh herbs!!  Thanks Chef, for an awesome recipe.",

While a bit decadent in terms of fat content, these potatoes make a unique and luxurious side dish for a special meal.  I served them alongside grilled king salmon for Christmas dinner, and it was a surprisingly great combination.\n\nI followed the recipe to the letter, and the one thing I will say is that mine needed closer to an hour in the oven (and I used about a cup of chicken stock total) for the insides to be cooked through and nice and creamy. I ended up having to stick them back in after removing them at 40 minutes, when my daughter tasted one and commented that it wasn't done yet.  So be careful to make sure they are cooked through before serving them.  I will say that the presentation on the platter with the flourish of thyme sprigs was quite striking!  Great recipe, and fun to try to something new.",
