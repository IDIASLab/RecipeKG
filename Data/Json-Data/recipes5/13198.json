My wife and I just had a lovely dinner of the scallops with pesto cream sauce.  I had recently frozen my own homemade pesto sauce which I put to work here. I also added a luscious black bean stock  I had cooked and frozen, then added it to the rice, which gave it an extra depth of flavor.  I spooned the scallops and cream sauce over the rice, then paired it with a beautiful Honeysuckle  sauvignon blanc from Fiddlehead Cellars( at this moment in my wine journeys it's still my favorite sauvignon blanc..  Gotta love the vinter Kathy Joseph).  I sauteed some asparagus with Maui onion and threw in some of that luscious bean stock as well.  My wife has a wonderful palette and she was truly gushing over this dinner.  Thank you for bringing such elegance to my table so quickly!",
