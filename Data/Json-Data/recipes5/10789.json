I can't wait to try this with sherry vinegar as I think it would be even more delicious! I think I will also add 1/2 a sliced onion just because onion makes everything taste better ?? I paired it with roasted Brussel sprouts and sliced avocado. Amazing meal!",

Depending on the thickness of the fish it may require much less especially at 450 so make sure to to check it sooner. I got busy and overcooked mine which was a real shame. The recipe itself however is very good. It's rather easy to make with a good amount of flavor! Would make this again for sure!",
