This was very good, but it lacked the more complex flavor of that served in a restaurant.The second time I made it,I pan fried the steaks as recipe calls for, then sauteed onions and mushroom slices in a sauce of 1T Dijon, 1/4 Cup brandy, 1T Worcestershire, 3T beef bouillon granules, lemon juice and the garlic. Left out the dry mustard. Very good.....",

I would look elsewhere for a good Diane recipe.",
