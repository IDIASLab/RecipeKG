I made this one using the golden butter cake mix from Duncan Hines and it turned out absolutely wonderful. I made it two ways as I had two boxes of mix that I wanted to get rid of. I did a layer cake with caramel frosting and a bundt cake with ganache poured over it. I wish I could give it a better rating because this is one of the few cakes I have come across that need no icing at all I found I prefer it alone although everyone at work loved it with the caramel icing. It's absolutely perfect. DON'T under any circumstances add banana creme pudding mix to it (like I did for the bundt cake). It's cake but it takes away from the banana flavor. This recipe is perfect just the way it's written. Thank you for sharing it Beth.",

I made a few minor changes--I used 1 cup of milk and added only 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp lemon juice to the bananas (I only had a half of a lemon) I also used 2 tsp pure vanilla extract and melted the butter in the microwave so it would mix into the batter easier. Instead of baking it in a 13x9-inch pan I used two 9 inch round cake pan and baked it for 30 to 35 minutes. I split the cakes horizontally and filled the cakes with a banana custard mousse filling and added some sliced strawberries to that and frosted it with a banana cream cheese frosting and decorated the cake with a few strawberries.
