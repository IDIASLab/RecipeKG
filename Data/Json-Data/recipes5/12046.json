For something different, try adding some Parmesan cheese to corn flake crumb mixture.",

The coating was a mixture of almond meal which is very low carb and a few crushed saltine crackers.  I added some Parmesan cheese as well.\nI was really surprised at how good it came out.  There was absolutely no mess, maybe because I used a fat-free cooking spray to coat the tinfoil on the cooking tray.  I served the hot dogs with steamed snow peas & carrots, and some fresh celery sticks.  I will definitely make this again, and plan to adapt the recipe so I can make it with my students during our nutrition unit!   ",
