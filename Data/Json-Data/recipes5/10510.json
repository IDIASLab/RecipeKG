Second time couldn't find fresh oysters so used a quart of shucked.  Made the butter mixture the same and improvised.  Toasted some homemade french bread using EVOO since plenty of butter in the mix.  Then I took medium sized ramekins and placed like 4-5 oysters in those using a little bit of the oyster liquor then topped with the butter mixture.  Cooked them at the same temperature for same amount of time.  Gave everyone their own ramekin and slices of toasted french bread, just spoon on top of the bread and wow, it is also awesome.  Next time I am thinking that I might try doing them in the same way you make creme broulee or flan, putting the ramekins in boiling water in the oven so it is more poaching I guess.  Will let y'all know how that turns out.  Thanks as always Chef John.",

Two tablespoons of Pernod was too little to purchase a bottle of it.   Anise is not a flavor my family uses often.  I made this recipe for 12 oysters and have 2/3 cup herbal butter leftover.
