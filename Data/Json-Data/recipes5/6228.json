I ended up adding in a full additional double amount of the dressing (lemon juice, olive oil, and salt/pepper), meaning 6 T each of the juice and olive oil in total, in order to get the consistency I wanted (still fluffy and not oily, I promise!). Still finding the flavor lacking in depth, I added some cumin, which for me was the magic pop that made the salad good. With these changes, I might make it again.",
