Another little tip is to heat your milk in the microwave before adding it to the potatoes.  If you add cold milk it sort of cools off your potatoes, and hot potatoes are better! For some reason it also makes them creamier AND taste better. TRY IT!!",

                "reviewBody": "Mmmm just like Mom used to make! I used 5 Tbs of butter and skim milk because that's all I had. After straining the water out I put the taters in the hot pot back on the burner on low and let the excess water steam away for a minute. Emeril suggests this for avoiding goopy or runny taters. I used a hand electric mixer right in the pot just like Mom. (Make sure your nonstick can handle it--mine can Cooks Essentials is tough.) Use a low speed to avoid overbeating. Add milk gradually until you get the consistency you want. I like mine thicker with a few little pieces to letcha know they're REAL. If you like a more perfectly whipped version a stand mixer would work better. Just keep an eye on it so you stop it at the right time. Do NOT substitute a food processor--wrong tool for the job. You'll get a glutinous glob. If you use a stand mixer preheat the bowl in hot water to keep your taters hot. Good idea to warm up your serving bowl too if you're using one. In addition to the add-ins other reviewers have mentioned try whipping in sour cream or fold in grated cheese crumbled crisp bacon sprinkle chives on it or anything you top taters with. I like just fresh ground salt pepper and butter. Good quality taters have a wonderful taste without needing to be hidden behind strong flavors. And don't let highly seasoned spuds upstage your main dish. Thanks Sandra for the recipe/prep tips!",

                "reviewBody": "Yes the use of the electric mixer is a great tip but the recipe in and of itself is a little more bland than I prefer. Not a bad start but I used heavy cream instead of milk (adding a little at a time to reach the desired consistency) more butter and my \"secret\" mashed potato ingredient -- just a tiny pinch of nutmeg as well as salt and pepper. Garlic black olive onion cooked carrot or spinach wasabi powder or shredded cheese are nice variations on the mashed potato recipe too. This is a versatile base. Use your imagination and add what you like. Also sometimes I scrub the potatoes well and leave the skins on. It makes for a less-smooth texture but adds nutrients. Adding a little dry milk powder will also enrich your mashed potatoes.",

If you want them to be extra fluffy as well place your bowl of mashed potatoes covered over a simmering saucepan of water for 10-15 mn. In addition to keeping them warm the texture will be fantastic!
