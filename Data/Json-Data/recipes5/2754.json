Measure out your confectioner's sugar or at least part of it. Cream butter alone (make sure your butter is NOT soft enough to hold an indentation - usually 30 minutes for me). Begin adding in sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, continue creaming it in, add ALL your banana mixture, cream that in, continue adding in sugar in 1/2 cup measures. I wound up adding more lemon juice, myself, to counteract the sugar. I've iced all 18 of AR's \"Banana Cupcakes\" with this & it's in the fridge -- I may revise this review if it's brown in the morning :=) Thanks for the recipe! (Note: I used 3 drops of yellow food coloring.) UPDATE: As of the following morning, my refrigerated iced cupcakes had NOT turned brown or discolored or wept in any way.",
