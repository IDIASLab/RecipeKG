It was kind of interesting that after taking a sip he said that years ago he used to make this for himself when he was sick or had the flu! Good call! This would be the perfect thing to drink when you're under the weather! It's light refreshing good for you with just a little bit of fizz. I do have to make it clear however that I used club soda and NOT tonic water. We agreed that we're not so sure we'd like this made with tonic water as it would be rather bitter.",
