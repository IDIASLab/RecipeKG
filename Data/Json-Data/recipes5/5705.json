I've never made breaded/fried mushrooms at home and was looking for an easy way to do it this was it! These were perfectly cooked...the breading stayed on nicely and the mushrooms themselves were tender and juicy. It's not even dinner yet and they are pretty much gone lol. I will def be using this method from now on and I can't wait to try the sauce next time too! Thanks for sharing.:)",

When you let the sauce sit it looks like a normal sauce but when you stir it up and start dipping it's like cottage cheese looking. It taste fantastic though but the feta just does not get a smooth texture to it. Would definitely make again...just season up the breadcrumbs more:)",
