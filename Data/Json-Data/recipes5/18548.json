I didn't have the heavy whipping cream but after some quick searching online found that a decent substitute is using half the amount of cream cheese so instead of 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream I used 1/4 cup cream cheese.  I also used two 40oz cans of yams which when cooked on the stovetop until softened and mashed with the mixer yielded almost exactly 6 cups.  It was a big hit all around and we will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!",
