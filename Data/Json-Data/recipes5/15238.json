Made as instructed, this is a very onion heavy dish. It would definitely benefit from  some addition of peppers and diced tomatoes without changing the nature of the dish over much. I will be making it again. Also, a Punjabi friend suggested to use lemon juice and not vinegar, but that may be a regional thing.",

I thickened it a little with a tsp of cornstarch in a little bit of cold water. As suggested I served it over rice. When I make this again (and I will) I'll try one of the reviewers suggestions to use prepared curry powder. I was reluctant to tell my husband what was for dinner because he can be a little picky but he LOVED this. I think it could use a little more spice; I thought it was just a tad bland but it may be that I used so much tomato that it watered it down. This will be on the regular rotation for Meatless Monday.

I also used a can of diced tomatoes in addition to a small can of tomato sauce (I don't find a huge difference between tomato puree and tomato sauce besides cost myself so I nearly always use plain tomato sauce when puree is called for). I always have a jar of ginger garlic paste in the fridge so I used a nice dollop of that instead of separate ginger paste and garlic paste. I left out the black pepper because not everyone here likes things hot. Next time I might cut down the coriander just a bit and honestly I can't help wondering how this would taste with a can of coconut milk.",
