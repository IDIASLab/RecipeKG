I don\u2019t use cake mixes often, but the simplicity and few ingredients of this recipe are what sent me to the kitchen.  In a word, we thought this was AWESOME!  I scaled the recipe in half, weighed the cake mix, and obviously, baked in a much smaller dish.  I\u2019m glad that I have enough for a second cake, because I feel certain that\u2019ll happen pretty soon.  \u201cGooey\u201d is a pretty good word to describe the texture which is somewhat similar to a brownie except much softer, and chewy would be another word. Follow the directions, and don't overbake.   The chocolate flavor is bold, and yes, it is very rich (smaller servings in this house).  Thanks for sharing, two thumbs up from the two of us.",
