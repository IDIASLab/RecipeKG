These people scraped the bottom of the pan and there was NOTHING left! They absolutely loved it!!!! I'm not sure I've ever had so many compliments over a recipe!!!! \n\nAs it turns out, our local grocery store actually had French vanilla pudding in stock, which is rare, so I made it with the French vanilla pudding this time. But I've made it with regular vanilla pudding in the past and it has been just as good. Enjoy!!!!!",
