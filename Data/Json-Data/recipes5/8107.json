Made changes based on necessity and preference.  halved the recipe but kept garlic amount the same.  Used red balsamic, dried basil, red onion, fresh chopped parsley, and roma tomatoes squeezed out and seeded.  added a bit of lemon zest and 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice to the dressing and this brought on an incredible level of flavor without being overwhelming.  Only had honey dijon mustard.  The colors are beautiful.  Followed the recipe proportions exactly even weighing potatoes, and using measuring cup.  I've never had a recipe where the dressing amount was so well-proportioned to the dry ingredients.  Just the perfect amount.  Excellent flavor and such an eye-appealing dish. **this would be a perfect potato salad to take on a picnic...no mayo to worry about heating up in the sun.",

I didn't have tomatoes so those were omitted. I also used regular balsamic vinegar instead of white balsamic vinegar. I really can't say enough about this salad! One tip: I always overcook my potatoes when I boil them so I cubed them and roasted them in some olive oil at 450 degrees for about 20 minutes and they were perfect. Because I used olive oil to roast I cut the oil in the dressing by a tablespoon. I will probably use even less next time. There will definitely be many next times!!!",
