        "description": "While this recipe is high in fat it works great for people on the Atkins diet. Even after eating two bowls per day I was still in ketosis. Heavy cream has no carbs which is why this works so well for folks on low-carb diets. Also fat is more filling, leading you to eat less and feel more full. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator. It's even better the second day. However, I've found if it sits longer than that the broccoli can become too strong.",

Set aside and continued cooking as originally directed. Even with my mistakes and changes, It still came out awesome.
