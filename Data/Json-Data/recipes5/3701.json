It's the life of the chicken. You need to baste it on the chicken while grilling, as the chicken can run dry. And that is where all the flavour is. I would recomend to leave the chicken in the marinade overnight for best results.",

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts that I should have pounded flat but didn't.:) I ran a little short of lemon juice so I didn't feel I had enough sauce on my chicken so next time I'm probably going to make double sauce if I use boneless skinless breasts again. This was wonderfully tasty and reminded me of naked hot wings in a way but so much better. The ginger and garlic give it a great flavor. You definitely need to appreciate spicy food to like this one! I served with oven roasted asparagus. Next time I think I'll try baking zucchini/squash maybe in the same pan. Also I'm going to pound out my chicken breasts or slice them into strips so the sauce really gets appreciated. Definitely a keeper for me and I can't wait to cook it for my fiance and friends.",
