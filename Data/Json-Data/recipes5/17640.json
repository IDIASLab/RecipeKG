The submitter of this recipe (Annabel) is going to cringe when she reads that I tried this will canned french style green beans - but that was all I had - couldn't get to the store for fresh beans and I wanted to jazz up canned beans.  I have a few recipes that do that but I decided to try this.  I used all the ingredients Annabel suggested - I ended up grinding the peppercorns with dried cilantro with my mortar (again-all I had at the time).  Then I heated up the oil, added everything except for the drained canned beans - sauteed everything for 60 sec., then added the beans and heated through. No one suspected they were canned and everyone loved them.  I ended up admitting I used canned and shared the recipe. Annabel, I will do you justice and do this again using the real thing next time.

While the green peppercorns aren't totally necessary (used black pepper here), it is absolutely essential to be able to use yardlong beans. They are less sweet than the western versions of green beans, which helps bring to life the sugar in the recipe.  I also subbed red chile pepper with about a tablespoon of Asian hot chile sauce and it turned out quite well.",
