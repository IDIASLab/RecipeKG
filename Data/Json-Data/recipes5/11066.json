But I don't like to review a recipe and say \"Okay this recipe is great but first you have to do this this and this\" and by the end you're nowhere near the original recipe. I also like to make a recipe from start to finish by the letter the first time I try it. Having said that even with a few changes/additions of spices this recipe is on the bland side. But that's what I was looking for!! I wanted something I could eat for breakfast that was on the savory side not spicy not offensive smelling when it was re-heated. This recipe was great for that. If you're looking for an impressive wowza side-dish look elsewhere but for what this is and for a change of routine for breakfast this was good.",
