A couple of holes in the recipe though that I had to fill in. Like the cucumbers. I wasn't sure what kind I was supposed to use. I ended up with an extra large garden cucumber and peeled and seeded it. Not sure if I was supposed to or not. Same with the tomato. There seemed to be an awful lot of juice coming out with the seeds included so I used one with seeds and one without. When it says 2 bunches, I guess it would be a different outcome if you had small bunches as opposed to large. I had really huge bunches so I only used one. I wished the measurement was in cups because I am such a tabbouleh newbie. Regardless, hubby and I enjoyed it and was happy to use all of my CSA veggies. We did a cheers to Maurice with dinner. Thanks for sharing your dad's recipe Charlie. I will make it again. My pic will be included in Sept 2013 Faceless Frenzy. :)",
