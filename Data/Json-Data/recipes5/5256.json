My picky husband and I have very different tastes and we both LOVED this dish--he said it's one of the best things I've ever cooked (I consider myself a decent cook).  I came on looking for a different recipe for blackened catfish that we use whenever we find catfish on sale, stumbled on this recipe, and I don't think we'll ever go back to the other recipe!  I did only use about 3 Tbs butter and that was plenty.  High marks from our house!",

I added some extra virgin olive oil to the butter and cut the amount of butter in half. I also used Tilapia instead of the catfish because that's what I had on hand. I also added a bag of jumbo shrimp already deveined but with the tails on. For the side I had asparagus. I placed the tilapia and shrimp together on a baking sheet on tin foil and the asparagus to the side of it but in the same pan. I baked in a 400 degree F. preheated oven for approximately 20 minutes. The rice I had pre-made and reheated back up in a steamer container in the microwave (took about 4 minutes) and timed it so every thing would be done at the same time.",

The blend of seasonings was very good but it was too much heat for us even with reducing the pepper and cayenne to 3/4 t. (Next time will reduce to 1/2 t and use less salt.) I coated the filets with 1/4c melted butter, sprinkled the rub on both sides then baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 mins. Part way through I turned the fish, drizzled with the remaining butter and finished baking until flaky.",

Will use some Extra-light Olive Oil when cooking the fish and halve the butter next time. There will still be enough butter after basting the fillets to add to the pan to help impart that smoothness. It was good and all but we like to use a lot of pan sauce over the rice and fish and it was very buttery. Using the Extra-light OO would cut some of the extra calories and such yet still allow the great flavors to come through.",
