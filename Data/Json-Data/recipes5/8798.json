                "reviewBody": "I've made at least a dozen types of keto/fathead breads which all have slightly different variations of ingredients. The flavor of these is delicious! The execution, however, is problematic, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I tried 1 bun using the stated method (cutting in half BEFORE baking) - the two halves turned out like small \"cookies\" and were very small and thin, about 3\" in diameter, about slider bun size but thinner. It was also difficult to keep the dough from becoming misshapen when cutting it raw.  I baked the next three buns without cutting them in half first. I rolled the dough into a ball, flattened it to about 3/4\" thickness and baked for 12 mins. Not only did these produce bigger buns, it was much easier to slice them in half after they had baked and cooled. Another issue: 425F was too hot (at least in my oven), so I lowered it to 400F and they came out perfectly browned.  I made my first one into a turkey sandwich - DELICIOUS!  These would also make great breakfast sandwiches with egg and sausage rounds, or shaped into biscuits.  They definitely have an eggy texture, but if you are used to fathead breads, you will love these!",
