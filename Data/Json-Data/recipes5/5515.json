In this variation I loved the additions of the fresh dill and chives and bacon almost guaranteed this would be a winner. I did use mayonnaise rather than Miracle Whip (haven't had Miracle Whip since I was a kid) and I could see as I was adding the mustard (I used all Dijon) and the salt that the amounts of both were going to be too much for me. I used about half of what was called for and that was right for us - better to add little by little and taste to adjust. It wouldn't be egg salad without chopped celery for us so I added some. Rather than a sandwich I used this for a light supper: a bed of lettuce dressed with a Lemon-Dijon vinaigrette and topped with a scoop each of this egg salad cottage cheese and tuna salad.",

To add a little more crunch I threw in about a half cup of chopped fresh celery. I did not have kaiser rolls I used whole wheat bread. Out of one recipe I was able to get five sandwiches worth of filling. Everyone really liked it my husband asked me if I would make this again for his lunch this morning. I made this again but omitted the honey mustard the second time--he texted me that he liked it even more today.",

We also didn't have the exact mustard the recipe calls for so I substituted a horseradish dijon for the regular dijon and added honey to the little regular dijon we had left...still turned out great. Definitely worth trying and adding your own flair!",
