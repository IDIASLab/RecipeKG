I had some fennel that I got from our local CSA that I needed to cook so I found this recipe here - thanks so much for posting it! It is fresh tasting a bit crunchy and is great either with pita crisps or other semi-salty chips OR even better served over grilled salmon or chicken! I added a bit of lime juice too and added an additional avocado and used a regular cucumber from the CSA too and it was perfect! I think you could also add a little dijon mustard (1/4 t. or so) or a dash or two of green Tabasco to kick it up a bit... but otherwise it's perfect as is! My semi-picky husband and 6-year-old daughter loved it too!",
