We prefer Ghiradelli brownies, so that's what I used (and used an 8X8 glass pan since they are a smaller yield).  I halved the PB and chocolate toppings to make up for the smaller pan.  I wasn't sold on the PB when I licked the beaters, but it really works on the brownies.  I'm super lazy, so I nuked the chocolate chips and butter for 45 seconds before pouring them over the PB layer.   I'll definitely make these again!  THANKS for the recipe!",

There is no way the three of could consume the whole recipe (or at least we shouldn't) so I cut the recipe in half. I used a kitchen scale to measure half of the mix accurately. We used an 8x8 glass pan. It was fun to make and very good. I have to admit that we altered the last step.  Instead of melting the chocolate chips with butter, we omitted the butter and sprinkled the un-melted milk chocolate chips on top of the peanut butter mixture. TIP-Before you measure the peanut butter, spray the measuring cup with baking spray or wipe the butter wrapper inside the cup so the peanut butter slides out easier. Works for us. As other's mentioned, it is very rich. But we'll be making it again. Thanks for the recipe!",
