I had an overabundance of dates that my inlaws sent from my husband's native country of Tunisia so they were rough chopped.  I also used hot brewed coffee instead of the boiling water to soak the dates/butter in.  When I was reading the recipe, I thought there was no way a bread made with only one quarter cup butter could be moist...boy was I wrong!  After cooling a bit, I immediately wrapped it in wax paper then aluminum foil and into a ziplock bag.  I then refrigerated it for several hours.  I couldn't resist any longer so I had to try it....I can't believe it is sooo moist and tasty!  A definite keeper and will use this when I receive another 'surplus' of tunisian dates!  thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.",

While I did modify the recipe somewhat, the core stands true.  I ran out of dates, and as one reader suggeted I used 1-1/2 c. dates and 1 c. chopped prunes.  I also used the orange idea another reviewer suggested. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 c. and after I toasted my raw walnuts in the oven I broke them apart with my hands, instead of chopping them b/c I like to taste my walnuts.  The other thing different I did was to use all whole wheat flour and add 1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten (you can purchase this at a natural foods store).  In my baking class I learned that whole wheat flour has very little gluten (the protein in flour) and by adding in the vital wheat gluten (which is almost all protein) it adds lightness to baked goods.  This is exactly what it did to my loaves.  I will do this again b/c IMO whole wheat is better than white or unbleached flours.  I also used three mini pans and baked them for only 30 minutes and they were done.  I really enjoyed this recipe.",
