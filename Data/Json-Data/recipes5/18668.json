Dumped drained beans into the crockpot one by one (I also added pinto beans just because I LOVE them). Then I mixed the 'sauce' ingredients together in a glass measuring cup stirred and added to the crockpot. It was a tad 'dry' (likely from adding the extra can of beans) SO I added 1/2 cup of hot water. PERFECT!! Let them cook on High for an hour and then turned it down to Low for another hour. I used a regular sized Crockpot and it was FULL to the brim. Everyone (read: KIDS) loved this dish. Follow the recipe seasonings and you won't be disappointed.",
