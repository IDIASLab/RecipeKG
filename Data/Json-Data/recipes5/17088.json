From the first time I went to make it, I didn't have all the right ingredients and found I could just about substitute anything, so long as I kept the dry-to-wet ratio the same. However, I have made one improvement, in my opinion, after having made this recipe at least a dozen times now: mix (or sift) all the dry ingredients in one bowl, all the wet ingredients into another (including the raisins and nuts) and then add the liguid to the dry. It requires less stiring this way, mixes more thoroughly and produces a more consistent result.\r\n\r\nI was also able to reduce the cholesterol and calories with a few minor changes without changing the flavor or texture.\r\n\r\nI used Enova in place of the vegetable oil, cholesterol free eggs (in the carton) and fat-free powdered milk (mixed according to the directions). No one could tell the difference.\r\n\r\nI also found it's possible to substitute squash for the carrots or applesauce (1-3/4 cups) for the apples and even to leave out the nuts entirely and increase the raisins to 2 cups (my husband doesn't like nuts).\r\n\r\nWhen using applesauce in place of apples, increase the cooking time by 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poster of this recipe deserves my hearty thanks!",

Love! this recipe! \r\nBesides the fact that they are super yummy and convenient (keep them in the freezer then pop them in the toaster oven in the morning for about 10 minutes for healthy hot breakfast muffins) the recipe is pretty flexible and hard to mess up so you can have fun with it. \r\n\r\nA few suggestions if I may: add shredded zuccini for a little more vitamin oompf, use applesauce and more carrot (or zuccini) if you don't have fresh apples, and throw in some fresh blueberries!!  I use whole wheat all purpose flour.\r\n\r\nRemember that it's always better to get whole flax seeds and grind them in your coffee grinder (store unground flax in cool dry place). Flax looses its oh-so-darn-healthyness really quickly. But if you do buy ground store, sealed, in the fridge.",

We bought a 92oz (huge) jug of Flax seed that was being sold at a local home and garden show becase the salesman said it would help with lowering my husband's cholesterol. Once we got it home and started adding it to food as suggested my husband decided that he HATED the taste of flax and refused to eat anything else I tried to \"poison\" with the stuff. He even threatened to bury it in the backyard. Then I found these muffins...which have been a real life-saver. We may get the rest of our flax seed eaten yet! Thank you for sharing this recipe. Compared to everything else we've tried....they are truly excellent.:)(Eventhough my picky hubby also made me leave out the raisins and the nuts!)

With the amount of moisture the shredded carrot and apple add this recipe could easily do away with the processed white flour for whole wheat instead which would take care of the pastiness and add flavor. Definitely increase the cinnamon to one or two tablespoons. It was barely noticeable.",
