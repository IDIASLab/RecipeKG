The only change I made to the recipe was to add cooked chicken instead of chick peas at the time of adding the spinach and cherry tomatoes.  I also used rotini pasta (as that is what I had on hand). I also added the curry paste and spice to the oil, garlic and onion mix before adding the liquids.  I intend to make this recipe again, except this time I will try pre-cooking the pasta first (very firm), and won't add water to the recipe, then I'll add the liquids and pasta and allow the pasta to absorb the liquids.  I found the taste of the starch from the pasta cooked in the liquids kinda prevailed in the overall taste which is why I rated it a 4. It wasn't terrible, just discernable. I plan to make it again with chicken.  I will likely also add chopped green or red peppers when cooking the the onion and garlic for extra veges. Having said all this, for those wanting a tasty one pot vegetarian supper, the recipe as written is it!  Overall, very good!",
