I had to use 2 lbs of ground beef because a 1 lb meatloaf is just not enough for my family. I ran out of breadcrumbs at 3/4 cup so I used enough French fried onions to make 1 cup and I used 1 cup of chopped sweet onions. I used fresh peaches sliced with the skin on and I doubled the sauce. It was really good. Hubby said it was okay but my one son and I both loved it (my other son refuses to eat meat loaf period). I will definitely make this again.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this last night for company and got rave reviews. Everyone took seconds. The loaf is a little denser than I normally prefer but wasn't a problem. I used 8 small fresh peaches and mixed the slices in with the sauce. I used only 1/2 tsp of salt which was plenty. I shaped it into a normal meatloaf (with the indentation in the center to hold peaches & sauce). I just couldn't see where all the juices and fat were going to go other than the bottom of my oven otherwise. I prepared it a bit ahead of time (about 1.5 hrs) and reheated for dinner. After cooking I found the loaf solid enough to easily transfer it to a serving platter without mishap. Oh last thought - I couldn't see the point of pricking the uncooked meatloaf with a fork before baking. Meatloaf by its very nature is a permeable thing. However I can see pricking it before adding the peaches and sauce - although I didn't bother. Fresh peaches tasted fresh: even after baking and reheating there was no doubt these were fresh peaches. We got to talking about how compatible fruit and meat are: turkey/cranberry sauce ham/pineapple and so on. Peaches and meatloaf is a great combination. Thanks for the post I'll be making this again. BTW - I served it with mashed potatoes & caramelized onions homemade baked beans and fresh tomatoes.",
