I'd never been a huge fan of liver before, but not only have I come to love dirty rice, I've also started to crave it with even more \"dirt,\" i.e. more liver, pork, and aromatic vegetables, hence this redundantly named dish. While the traditional method cooks the rice first before \"soiling\" it, here we add all the \"filth\" at the beginning and cook it into the rice.",
