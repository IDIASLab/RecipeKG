I did a couple of things differently though:  I used a 1 1/2 pound tenderloin, and for the vinegar I used half balsamic and half white (I was out of cider vinegar). I didn't want the pork to dry out, so I covered it for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Next time I would slice the tenderloin and mix it in with the apples and sauce - that would warm it up a bit and coat the pork as well, since much of the sauce cooks away.   As a side note, the apple sauce would be amazing on top of vanilla ice cream or french toast! It is absolutely wonderful!",

My only recommendation would be to brown both sides of the pork making sure not to overcook..otherwise the meat will dry out. Set aside as directed and prepare the apple mixture. Then while apple mixure is simmering add the pork back into the pan cover and cook for a few minutes on each side. Love love love the tender apples..mmmm.. so good!",

I cooked it in my dutch oven instead of a skillet so I knew I had room for the extra apples. I also put the meat back into the apples (not cut into medallions) and put the pot on low until my husband got home from work -- probably an extra 45 mins or so. The meat was tender and juicy and cooked perfectly. The apples were awesome. I used 2 Ida Reds we will definitely have this again!
