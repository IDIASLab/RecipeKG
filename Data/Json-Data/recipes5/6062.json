        "description": "Here's an Italian classic that needs no adaptation to make it paleo.There are plenty of everyday meals that are paleo and many people don't realize it.  Broccoli rabe and sausage is one of them. Luckily for me it's also an Italian dish. This is a meal you will most likely find on an Italian restaurant menu. It should be made with olive oil, not butter, and you can ask to omit the shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano. Although, darn, that stuff is good. Lemon zest brightens it and adds a subtle, yet significant flavor.",
