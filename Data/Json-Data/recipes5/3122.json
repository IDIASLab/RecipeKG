Also - we had to add a lot of extra water to get the dough to be able to be kneading, probably more than twice as much water as is called for in the recipe.

I ended up using more water to get the dough more \"elastic\" - I was reaching almost a full cup but then I just stopped and dealt with it as is for fear up messing up the entire recipe. The meat (beef not lamb) cooked fine. Smelled even better. But when I had to add it to 4\" \"half circles\" I laughed. No way that can be done is such a small tiny bit of space (not without taking an hour to assemble them/using all the dough called for). So I started making bigger circles but half way through THAT I noticed that the \"completed\" ones sitting out waiting to be fried were oozing some liquid. They were not by any means full or stuffed. But the oiliness from the beef makings made the seals open. I tried to fix them but I made it worse. Next time someone might take the time to follow their own recipe and make sure the instructions are well written and yield good results. I'm now going to try and find a recipe to use for that left over samosa beef",
