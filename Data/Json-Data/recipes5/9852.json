I found cream/sausage/mushrooms all for around 1$.  The crusts were 2$ (you could easily save money by making your own: 1 cup flour, 1/2 c shortning, 1/4 c tepid/warm water, pinch salt. Mix w/ dough cutter or two forks in crosswise motion against each other till makes little crumbleys and then work into ball with the tips of your fingers. Trick is to get to a ball and then roll out. no need to knead! Then roll out to 1/8 inch thick. Your good to go. This makes 1 9inch crust, repeat if needed.) This is easilly a winner to serve for friends or family as the mmmm factor of richness plays off the back of your throat tickling your savory taste buds.  Umami all the way!",

The only thing that made this a 4 rather than 5 star is that I thought the egg/liquid ratio was for perhaps 1 quiche rather than 2. I doubled it (the egg/liquid) in mine (and perhaps could have even tripled it). In my opinion it would then be perfect for 2 quiche!!! Flavor was VERY good and simple ingredients!!!",

I didn't realize when I bought my pie crust that I bought deep dish crusts! So I cooked an extra half pound of sausage another carton of mushrooms and double the egg and cheese mixture. Since I wasn't planning to double (except for the mushrooms since they always cook down so much) I didn't have enough of the heavy whipping cream so I substituted regular whipping cream which worked just fine. I'll be using the regular whipping cream from now on. This dish was creamy and smooth. My husband asked that we eat this for more than just holidays!",
