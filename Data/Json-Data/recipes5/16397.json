I followed the recipe EXCEPT I added my own twist: I make the glaze without the oil and added enough lemon juice (maybe 1 tbsp) and an extra tbsp. of apricot nectar. I poked holes all through the finished cake (while still hot in the pan) and poured this glaze over the holes. Let it sit for about 20 minutes to soak up the glaze then turned out onto a cooling rack. Made another batch of apricot/lemon glaze (this time a bit thicker) and drizzled that over the top of the cooled cake. This is one awesome cake! Very impressive!",

I baked this in a chrysanthemum-shaped bundt pan. I had to pour the glaze in batches for it all to soak in and still had a little left over. I was extremely happy with the result-- moist and flavorful definitely tangy-- but I will say I didn't taste much apricot. I used Kern's Apricot Nectar. I think the coconut makes this recipe as does the glaze. This was REALLY yummy and my husband enjoyed it too (perfect for our second anniversary!)",
