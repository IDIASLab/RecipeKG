I was a little hesitant on the cook time of the lentils but figured I'd just make it as written. I was right - after cooking for only 15 mins and sitting for 30 the lentils were nowhere done. I had to put the soup back on heat and simmer for an additional 15 mins but by then the pasta and zucchini/squash was mush and I also had to add an additional cup of liquid. My recommendation is after adding the carrot mixture and lentils simmer for at least 20-25 minutes (instead of 7) before continuing on with the rest of the recipe. You will also likely need to add additional salt to your tastes. I used ditalini pasta because that's what I had on hand. Thankfully I snapped a pic before the additional round of simmering while the vegetable colors were still nice and vibrant.",

As the previous reviewer said the cooking time is way off but the flavor of the soup is fantastic so I decided on 4 stars because it was too yummy to go lower. Here is how I made it and it was cooked perfectly. Instead of cooking the lentils for 7 minutes before adding the pasta I cooked them for about 30-40 minutes. I started with 20 minutes and tasted the lentils which were still very firm and kept adding an additional 5 minutes until they were tender. Then added the pasta and another cup of liquid (broth) and cooked for 3 minutes. Then added the squash and another cup of broth and cooked an additional 5-8 minutes. Done and delicious. Next time I will add the pasta and squash at the same time. BTW I didn t add any oregano (don t care for it) and I used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of the Italian tomatoes called for. I thought this soup had a very fresh taste to it. I will make this again.",
