In celebration and anticipation of our return to Italy Hubs and I enjoyed this wonderful buttery smooth after dinner drink tonight as a commemorative toast Frangelico being my favorite liqueur on the planet. The thought of bits or even chunks of hazelnuts ruining what would otherwise be a smooth and creamy treat didn't appeal to me so I left them out just sprinkling a few chopped hazelnuts on the whipped cream garnish. Just as I had anticipated this was really delicious - rich and creamy and because of the outstanding Italian Frangelico a very fitting after dinner drink on the eve of our exciting trip.",
