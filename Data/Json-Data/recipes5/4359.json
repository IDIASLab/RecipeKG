My plan was to make this for my family but I just proceeded to eat the entire bowl myself. I made it with plain long-grain white rice (didn't have basmati). And next time I make it (which will be today) I think I'll omit the olives because as much as I love them they tended to dominate (rather than compliment) the other flavors in the salad. Adding pistashio nuts is a stroke of genius! Thanks for the great recipe!",

I used tomatoes from my garden and the lemon mint and parsley makes it so fresh-tasting! The olives give it a nice saltiness and the pistachios are crunchy. Loved this recipe. Will definitely use it over and over again.",
