Spooned out  a cup of chili so that the cornbread mix would fit, and that reserve came in handy to chili-fy my husband\u2019s 2nd serving. Super yummy & easy recipe.",

I used the Gluten Free Corn Muffin Mix from Bob's Red Mill since the regular Jiffy mix was out of stock, and used regular sharp cheddar cheese. I just followed the instructions on the package of corn muffin mix and doubled the cheese since gluten free stuff tend to be drier. Crust tuned out moist and perfect. For the chili, I could only get regular diced tomatoes so I used two cans of that. This recipe is very forgiving and hard to mess up. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Chef John!",
