I did a couple of things different; cream the sugar with the butter and peanut butter instead of mixing the sugar with the flour mixture. It made for even mixing. Also be sure to mix the wet ingredients well before adding to dry mixture. I also didn't use the streusal topping just made a simple chocolate frosting instead. I like this cake because it was so fluffy and wasn't too rich just the perfect amount of flavor.",

                "reviewBody": "This cake was actually the first cake I've ever made from scratch and I was quite impressed with the results. I did however change a few things. I made this cake in two 9 in. round pans instead of in a rectangular pan. Because of this I baked it at 350 degrees for 20 min. instead of 375 for 30 min. I also added a tablespoon of vanilla to the batter. Like another poster stated the streusel was much more like cookie dough than crumbly streusel. I had to add it by hand so that I could make sure it was broken up into pieces. I reserved some of the streusel mixture so that I could spread it around the sides after the cake was done. I'm happy I did because after baking the streusel on top of the cake looked beautiful but almost blended in with the flavor of the rest of the cake. Next time I think I'll do what other posters did and cook the streusel on the stove top and add it to the cake after it's done baking or go with some chocolate frosting as I can see how chocolate frosting could probably bring this cake together nicely. As for the moistness of the cake mine came out odd where it seemed like a mixture of moist and dry. It would seem moist when I first put it in my mouth but dry after it sat in my mouth for a while. My husband said it was more moist than dry but he's a cookie lover so anything moister than a cookie he'd probably call moist:)",

I did not use all the strousel topping I just baked it seperately on a frying pan and ended up with a nice soft sweet thing. I over-baked the cake a bit (35 mins) it caused some of the strousels on the top to burn. I removed the burned strousels by hand and no problem. My mom and Dad loved it. I used normal white sugar instead of brown sugar and crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy peanut butter and no problem at all. Thanks for this wonderful recipe",
