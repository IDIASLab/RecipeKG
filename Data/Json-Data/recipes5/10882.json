I\u2019ve been wrapping things in bacon for years and there are some tricks to it. First, par cook the bacon for say 25 minutes on 325 between 2 sheet pans or something to keep it flat. I use parchment paper in between as well. That doesn\u2019t cook the bacon fully. I then wrap the loins and  cook at 375 until an internaL temp of about 128-130. I do this to then broil on high, both sides of the roast to crisp the bacon up, about 5 minutes a side is all that needed. My temp turns out around 140 when I pull it out which goes up to 145-148 after resting. I also doubled the spice mixture because I make two tenderloins at a time with this recipe. Excellent recipe though. I added no additional ingredients. Thanks John.",
