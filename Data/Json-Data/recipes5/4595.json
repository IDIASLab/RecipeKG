I did substitute oregano and Italian seasoning for the thyme and basil but I don't think it was those spices that made it taste strange. I think its the wine. Maybe not so much? Also I wouldn't puree the soup. It turned out brown. Maybe reduce the broth by half so it creates more of a \"stew\" consistency and leave the veggies as they are.",

I then transferred to a pot and added 4 tsp bullion ground thyme basil parsley juice and I used spicy sea salt. Brought to a boil stirred well and simmered on low 1 hour. No red wine lime juice instead of lemon juice water and bullion instead of chicken broth. I based my soup on this recipe because of the amount it makes. I substituted based on what ingredients I had on hand. I always blend my soup veggie and fresh spices raw. It is faster and safer. Apparently the wine added a lot of the flavor. I did not like the way the flavor of mine turned out. I served 1 1/2 cups of the soup to test. Then I added 1 small can of chicken. This improved the taste for me.",
