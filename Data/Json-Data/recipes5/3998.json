I let the chicken marinate for about 2 hours, turning once.  I lined my baking tray with foil (lightly greased) and covered and baked chicken for 20-25 minutes at 350.  I then removed foil cover and took the \"basting mixture\" and spooned mixture over the top of the chicken (making sure to have plenty of red bell pepper and garlic pieces on top of the chicken) and returned to oven to bake for approximately 10 more minutes; towards the end I set the oven to broil for just a couple minutes to brown for color and crisp up the tops.  This chicken turned out so moist and flavorful.  I read many reviews that said they did not have a red bell pepper, and therefore did not include it.  I'm sure it tastes delicious both ways, but in my opinion, using the finely chopped red bell pepper adds so much flavor!  I couldn't imagine this dish without it (maybe it's b/c I purposefully spooned on a plentiful amount when I put the extra mixture over the chicken).  Either way, this was a definite hit in my house and I will be making again!  Thanks for sharing!",
