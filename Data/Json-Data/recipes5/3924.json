Some were quite good but I never could find exactly the right touch till this one. Some are too garlicky some too sour some too bland. All seemed to be similar but not quite right. With this recipe the curry powder is the winning secret ingredient. The slight changes I would make is to add 1/4 c. water instead of the 1/2 (it is runnier than I prefer). As others have said I would lessen the curry pwd. just a mite. The next day seems to even intensify the flavors making the curry issue even more noticeable. The quantity is perfect using the two cans of chickpeas. Thanks so much for the recipe!",
