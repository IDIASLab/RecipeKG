Also a word to the wise--I'd recommend using normal-sized vegetables.

I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes (lazy)including the juice and added about 3 cups of shredded cabbage that I needed to get rid of (not traditional I know but it does such an amazing job soaking up the spices!). I ate this with Syrian bread which I used to scoop the veggies and soak up the broth and it was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!",
