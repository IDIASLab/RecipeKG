I recipe note though....instead of putting marshmallows in pot I transfer mixture to a baking dish, then add marshmallows and bake at 375 until mallows are melted and golden brown. Enjoy!",

I had baked sweet potatoes on hand (1 hr 40 min @ 350 degrees) so I substituted an equal measure for the canned; I too put the warm sweet potato mixture in a serving container and then browned the (small sized) marshmallows with a quick zap under the broiler. I noticed the first time I made these that they hold their shape upon serving which gave me the idea to use this as a super-quick easy cheater version of sweet potato pie - just put the mixture into a graham cracker crust top with marshmallows brown. Really yummy! If you won't be serving the whole pie the same day I suggest washing it with egg white baking (to seal out the moisture from the filling). Definitely a must-try.",
