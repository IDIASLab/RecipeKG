I would maybe next time bake the brownie a little longer before topping it with the s'mores mixture, and cover it with foil to avoid too much darkening of graham crackers and marshmallows. I will definately bake it again in the future. It would be a great dessert to take to a potluck. It really goes further than you might think, given the fact that it's so rich.",

To make it not so rich, i always bake my borwnies on a cookie sheet  (15\"x10\"x3/4\" or about that size) It makes the brownies thinner, then when you add the toppings, cute and serve, that are the perfect portion!! I also add about 2 TBS melted butter to the graham cracker mix, to keep it together a little better!!  YUM YUM!",
