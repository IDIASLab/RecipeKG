Everyone loved the goat cheese and the arugula salad on top and could not believe this was a CAULIPOWER crust it was so nice and crispy. I would cut back on the lemon juice next time around maybe use the juice of half a lemon. I also used just one roasting pan to save some cleanup. This was a nice delicious-tasting change up for pizza night. Thanks for the Great Recipe",

The CAULIPOWER crust also makes it much easier to follow a low-carb lifestyle, plus it's gluten-free! I cooked my pizza directly on the rack, as I find the crust gets more crispy that way.  The goat cheese mixture really takes the pizza over the top. The finished product is like a symphony of flavors and textures  in your mouth - sweet, tangy, creamy, peppery. This makes a lot of arugula, so if you're serving it on the side, make the full amount. If you're serving it as a topping, you can probably get away with half. I also didn't use the full amount of lemon juice, since 1-2 teaspoons was plenty. I will definitely be making this again!",
