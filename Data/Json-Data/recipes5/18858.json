I agree with Mollytina and her review completely that the wonderful apple flavor just shines through! And the bit of cinnamon in the  topping is just the right amount to complement the apples. (No wonder Jan calls these Apple Pie Muffins!)  If I had added all that cinnamon and other spices that others thought it was necessary to do, I would have never known what I was missing!  These muffins are refreshingly delicious. The recipe stands, in my book, with no corrections necessary and will become a favorite I'll go back to often. Thanks for your wonderful recipe Jan! ",

I made these exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing. The crumb topping is so out of this world that the muffin itself does not need any added spices. The two were a perfect balance for each other. Moist, flavorful. Grease your muffin tins very well and fill the cups to the top as directed, and you will obtain gorgeous, huge muffin tops that hold all of that spectacular crumb topping. It took a few minutes of careful excavation to remove them from the pan with the tops intact, but letting them cool for about 10 minutes helped.",
