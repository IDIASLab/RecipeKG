Couldn't believe it when I found this recipe using those exact veggies :)  I regularly use lemon juice on veggies, and I love coriander but have never used it on veggies that I recall. Turns out I loved it.  That along with the lemon juice complemented the produce very well.  I'll be trying coriander on other veggies in the future.",
