As others have noted it seems to be missing the main ingredient fire roasted red peppers. Also 2 tbsp of pomegranate molasses lemon juice would be mouth puckeringly sour! Also and I promise this will be the last 'also' the taste of this dip is great enhanced by roasting walnuts. I've made this twice now from a recipe I found on epicurious and subbed panko bread crumbs the last time (time saver!) and it turned out fine. Definitely worth your time and it keeps well in the fridge for days.",
