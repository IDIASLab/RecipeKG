I substituted ground turkey breast for the beef and light Polish kielbasa to make this chili really healthy. Also by mistake I used Cubanelle peppers instead of Anahiem (although they are almost identical in taste). What also drew me to this recipe was the lack of salt as we are on a very low sodium diet. I was really nervous because there was no liquid other than the vinegar but the tomatillos and the tomatoes gave off a lot. The end result was a medium spicy delicious chili with great flavor! I did sprinkle in some cumin after tasting but that is just personal preference. Thank you for the recipe!",
