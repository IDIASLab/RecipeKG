I had a small boneless breast, about 3 pounds, so I adjusted the method, measurements and cooking time to accommodate it, but other than rubbing the roast with some olive oil before sprinkling it with salt, pepper and a little chopped rosemary, I made no substitutions or omissions of ingredients.  I cooked it about 6-1/2 hours on low.  This was fragrant, immensely flavorful and so tender and moist.  The juices it gave off during cooking made for excellent gravy.  When I\u2019m the first reviewer of a recipe, as I am here, and it turns out this good I couldn\u2019t be more pleased to review it.  I served this with Ann\u2019s Rice Pilaf, Chic Green Beans, recipes also from this site, and a tossed green salad.",

                "reviewBody": "I could only find a 3 lb boneless turkey breast.  It did not have a cavity (I guess since it's boneless), so I put the thyme and rosemary sprigs on the very bottom of the crockpot.  Then I placed 32 oz. peeled baby carrots, one bunch of chopped celery, and one medium chopped onion on top of the herbs.  I topped that with the pats of butter, but only 1/3 of a cup instead of half. I placed the turkey on top of that and sprinkled with a little bit of salt and pepper.  Then I poured in the wine and cooked it on low for 6 hours.  My crockpot tends to run hot or cook fast, or something of the sort.  I think I inadvertently poured a little more than half the bottle of wine in the crockpot.  It was delicious.  It smelled wonderful while cooking, the whole family enjoyed it, and the turkey was very moist.  I served this with some stuffing on the side.  This is an excellent meal, and I will definitely be making it again.  Thank you for posting!",
