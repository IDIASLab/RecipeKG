I used olive oil and salt instead of butter and I actually just cooked the chicken breasts right in the non-stick skillet with everything else. I made sure to keep basting as I was cooking. The chicken itself lacked something...probably just helps to marinate it in something beforehand but the sauce is SO good! It tastes comparable to something you find at a Chinese buffet. I think next time I'll cut the chicken breasts into chunk-size pieces in order to get the sauce all over it. I think it would also be delicious with chopped or whole peanuts if you like them. Definitely will make again!",

Maybe needs one or more of these ingredients: salt pepper season salt hot sauce or other spices. My kids liked it though. If I make this again I'm going to add some ingredients and maybe make kabobs instead of using the half of breast. I think using smaller pieces would really bring out the flavor of the sauce. This recipe has potential! Update July 29 2005. OK I tried this with kabobs I cut boneless skinless chicken breasts into bigger than bitesize chunks put them on skewers with red onion red and green pepper. I bought a 3 pound package of boneless skinless chicken from Costco. I have a family of 4 I did have some leftovers but not much! I tripled the recipe but I used two tablespoons of lemon pepper for the whole sauce recipe and omitted the lemon juice added salt and cayenne pepper to taste. I kept the cayenne mild for the kids. Cooked it on the grill and basted with the sauce. Soooo good! Thank you for the inspiration! I would have never came up with this without this recipe posting!",
