It really is a 'throw-in-whatever-you-have' type recipe and I added chocolate chips and crushed pecans and it was delicious. I took previous reviewers' advice and cut the brown sugar in HALF and it was perfect! TIPS: When melting butterscotch: Someone said they chucked it because it was curdled - don't chuck it! Just keep melting and stirring! It won't be smooth the way chocolate chips are when you melt them in the microwave. The butterscotch may look grainy but don't worry just keep stirring and melting in 30 second intervals. Once you mix in the eggs and vanilla extract it'll become smooth and shiny. You'll be fine and you won't regret it!",
