Half the receipes on this site call for a half pound of bacon and copious amounts of butter. No kidding. Even with the added spices and mashing -- no matter how I wished them to be like mashed potatoes these suckers had a life of their own. They retained their diced shape -- no matter how much mashing I subjected them to. The hubster, a man who claims to love vegetables and would like to go vegetarian but in reality will only eat maybe 3 vegetables (green beans, cauliflower (raw only) and I'm hard pressed for third vegetable), was very adventurous in his forkfuls...and I had to call it early -- Dear God Man! Back away from the turnips! I still gave the receipe 4 stars as it's not the recipe, we just don't dig turnips. ",

If the turnips you grew in your garden came out kinda small tough and strong not even a generous dose of fat and sugar will magically make them edible!
