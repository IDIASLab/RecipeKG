I made this recipe as stated except I used fresh chicken breast because I had some on hand I needed to use. My husband loved this. It didnt come out as pretty I used pillsbury crescent dough sheets. I got tired of making the crescents so made balls instead. I have filling left over(only used one crescent) so I am making a calzone for dinner. Will make again!",

Everyone was raving during the New Years party my husband commented at the end of the night AND next morning about how good they were and my mom called to tell me how much my dad liked them and that when he went back for more they were gone. My changes were: 1. pulled meat from leftover buffalo wings (meat only skin tossed). 2. Replaced chopped onion with chopped celery. 3. used half the cream cheese and added chunky blue cheese. 4. didn't stir in hot sauce...dribbled a little on crescent roll dough first then added mixture and rolled up. 5. omitted cheese on top. 6. didn't serve with dipping sauce. I forgot to but it certainly didn't need it. Will definitely make again....I think I'll be requested to.",

We filled all 4 and still had some filling leftover, which we used for dip.  I added 1chopped celery stick, and omitted the ranch dressing.  I also put cheddar cheese inside and on top of each bite, and found that it was just as easy to roll the filling up in the precut crescents, rather than rolling and cutting into rounds. These bites were a big hit with all our guests and I will definitely make again.  Thank you!",
