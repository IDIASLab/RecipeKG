The sauce is SO SO good and I think adding the lemon slices early on really makes it POP like you suggested with a beautiful fragrance and taste.  My family was very impressed.  UPDATE:  Made this for my husband's business client and he asked for the recipe to take home.  Also, someone said they thought the sauce was too acidic.. adding lemon slices in at the end only heightens the acidity, not tempers it.  I happen to love the taste of lemon like this, but that's just me.  Try adding some white wine to the first reduction, then add the chicken broth and go from there.  That might help.",

Also pound the chicken breasts out a little so they cook faster.  I use white wine instead of chicken broth for the sauce.  This sauce really requires some tasting to check for tartness as it reduces.  If it's too tart, add a small amount of sugar starting with a tsp.  Chicken Picata is probably my favorite chicken dish and it's truly elegant and 'company' worthy.",

To stop the bitterness do not add the lemon slices to cook with the sauce, use lemon zest and finish with the butter, the white pith is what is making it bitter.  Add lemon slice when serving.  I also am going to try grilling the chicken and making just a quick lemon pan sauce with shallots, white wine, perhaps a riesling or pinot grigo and garlic, however; no chicken broth.  I would not cut into medallions leave in breasts in tact.  To thicken maybe a little cornstarch and water if necessary.  I will let you know how it turns out.\nAfter making this, the grilling part probably not needed, pan frying would have been fine.  The sauce I made was great only wish it had made more.  Cornstarch not necessary.  But a great recipe!",

I just never cook exactly by any recipe.  Here is what I did differently... I pounded out the chicken but did not cut it in medallions.  I pan fried it in a cast iron skillet using olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  After the chicken, I wiped out the pan and added a little more olive oil and some margarine (I have a dairy allergic person in my family so no butter).  I added 2 cloves of garlic then a 1/2 lb of thinly sliced baby portabella mushrooms.  After the mushrooms released their juices, I added the liquid.  I used 2 cups of good chicken stock plus 1/2 cup of a reisling.  I also double the lemon juice and left out the lemon slices.  I zested one lemon into the sauce and saved the lemon slices for plate garnish.  When correcting seasoning at the end, I added a generous amount of sea salt and fresh cracked pepper and a pinch of raw sugar.  I served the chicken with the extra sauce over mini bow tie pasta.  All three of my kids ate this and my husband gave it a thumbs up and I loved it.  I would definitely make this one again!",

Maybe, the lemons I used were the problem?  I loved the cooked chicken before adding the sauce. It was both tender and crispy.  I tried to fix the sauce by removing the lemon slices and adding white wine and a little extra butter.  I served with rice and the person I ate dinner with ate all of theirs, but I couldn't get over the bitter bite still lingering.  Although, he did not seem to notice for some reason. Make sure you use really fresh lemons!  I believe that could have been the issue, but not sure? Great sauted chicken either way.",
