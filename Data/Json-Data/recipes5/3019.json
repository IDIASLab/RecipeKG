The rest of the dressing ingredients in the recipe were already full of flavor so we didn't miss the mayo. I also removed all the chicken skin (I know all the fun bits!). I just eyeballed the whole recipe and it still turned out yummy! The creaminess of the dressing counters the relative dryness of the pita and chicken. I kept the veggies on the side (used leftover salad instead of shredded lettuce) until we were ready to eat. Hubby took the leftovers to work the next day (pita chicken with dressing and veggies all packed separately to prevent sogginess). So quick and easy I know this will be a regular at our table. Hubby already requested for this to be packed for his lunch regularly.:)",

I didn't measure -- just poured in some ketchup a little more chili sauce and even a little more mayo until the mixture (onions chicken and cheese was already in there) was the consistency I'd want in a sandwich. Also I'm usually not a big fan of ketchup and mayo especially mixed together but I was pleasantly surprised by this. I did add a dash of nutmeg and maybe 1 tsp of dried parsley so that maybe also helped it not taste like ketchup&mayo. Oh and I added some chopped almonds for a little crunchy texture. Like someone else mentioned I didn't add the lettuce to the mixture but rather added it to the sandwiches as I was assembling them. And lastly I don't understand why the recipe only calls for ONE pita bread. Maybe others have huge pitas but I've only ever seen 7\" ones - we needed way more than one! (I think we used 5 total.)",

I didn't have roasted chicken so I used 3 boneless chicken breast(1#) and sliced them thin while still partially frozen. I made the sauce minus the onion and added 2 T honey to compensate for the flavor. I then cooked the chicken in a fry pan with about half of the sauce until done(had more sauce than I needed) Then I filled the pita with chicken/sauce mixture the cheese lettuce and some chopped tomatoes. I also used fresh lime juice instead of lemon. So I didn't change much except the way it was prepared. My son and I thought it to be kind of ketchupy flavored and agreed it had that sloppy joe taste. This was a different change from the usual pita fillings and if you like sloppy joes I think you will like this. Thanks Irene!",
