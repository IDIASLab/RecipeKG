I am reviewing myself today and giving myself 2 stars for failure to give you guys the correct recipe.  DO NOT use an entire jar of sauce.  I always use 2/3 to 3/4 of a jar.  It won't turn out terrible with an entire jar but it's unnecessarily saucey, filling up the entire glass baking pan and will then take longer to cook. My apologies for any confusion.  Please try this meal for a healthy and delicious way to enjoy more fish in your diet!!",

I used less sauce and more haddock- just under 2 pounds of fresh haddock to 1/2 jar of sauce (i used Roa's marinara)i left out the tomatoes (if you do include them i would recommend a flavored one or add seasonings. and use a good sauce cause its the main flavor off the dish) lightly sprinkled the top with italian seasoning before baking i also did half the cheese and replaced the other half with paremsan. i served with angel hair but larger sized pasta would work well too.",
