Well Pop was at the market at that very moment and an hour later I went to try my first taste of this new obsession. \n\nMy tomatoes and basil were abundant in my garden.  In case the color is distorted,  I used yellow and orange low acid varieties,  please don't think this was an unripe red.\n\nI love the presentation,  the flavors divine.  I wish I had company planned so I could impress someone!  I did not use any vinegar;  would have been a shame to mask the delicate flavors.  Also used Himalayan pink salt, slightly too much.   Definitely  have some crusty Italian bread on hand,  not to spread the cheese,  but to mop up every last drop of goodness from your plate.  Summer ripe tomatoes and fresh mozzarella are one of my favorite food.  I shall never think of them the same way again.",
