        "description": "Mike came up with this recipe during the first dinner we cooked together in our brand-new apartment! We were inspired by a similar dish we've had at an Italian restaurant, but used it as a side dish instead of an antipasti plate, and substituted the prosciutto with bacon. The cheese, a relatively mild cow's milk cheese, should be relatively easy to find because of its increasing popularity. Super easy to make, and super tasty!",
