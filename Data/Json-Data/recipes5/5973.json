I decided to use them all and in the amount suggested. The lemon juice helped give the citrus taste of an orange the honey gave the sweetness and the chia seeds work as a thickener. My mango and banana was frozen so on the water part I had to add an additional 1/2 a cup for half the recipe. I am not sure what mineral water is but I used cold spring water. I like having a smoothie that incorporates a vegetable or two. ty",
