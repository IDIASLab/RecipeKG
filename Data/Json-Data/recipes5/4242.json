Another change I made was to \"sweat\" the eggplant before cooking. I find that I do not like the taste of eggplant unless I sweat it first. To do this slice the eggplant into about 1/2 inch slices sprinkle both sides of each slice generously with salt and let sit for at least an hour. The eggplant should release a fair amount of liquid. When ready to cook rinse off the eggplant slices and pat dry.",

Cover with another layer of paper towels. Let stand for 15-25 minutes. rinse & pat dry. Dice or cube as needed and continue with recipe. I think it will help.:)",

I also doubled the spinach and used probably 2 tbsp lemon juice. I will make this as often as I can find a decent-looking eggplant!",

I left the skin on the eggplant and I used 6 cups of spinach because it cooks down so much. I used whole wheat rotini and threw in a handful of toasted pine nuts. Very tasty!",
