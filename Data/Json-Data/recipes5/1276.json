I make this with a decent bottle of Sauvignon Blanc because the acidity in the wine pairs well with the lemon juice and the fresh cut grass-like aromas of the asparagus. Chill the rest of the bottle and have it with your meal! Remember to always use a wine that you enjoy the flavor of by itself if you're going to cook with it because the food takes on the flavor of the wine.",

I added the photo because there was not one yet but I actually forgot to take one before. So it\u2019s taken after I tossed it all together and we ate most of it. I made it as written but  I had cavatappi pasta rather than penne so used that. My son can\u2019t do spicy so we all just added the red pepper to taste which worked well. I saut\u00e9ed some mushrooms I had on the side and those of us who like mushrooms dumped them in too. When I make again I might try reducing the butter and upping the wine and lemon to cut back on fat and calories. As is, I would happily serve to guests. Thank you!!",
