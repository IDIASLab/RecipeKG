This recipe is a solid base and can be 5 stars (maybe not Thai 5 star) with a few adjustments:\nWhen browning meat: add garlic cloves & pepper of your choice ( I used 5 dried chile de arbol). Tip: If chiles are not cut open exposing seeds it really lessens the spiciness. \nHigh quality peanut butter matters!! Use fresh grind or an unsweet type (I used \"Tree of Life\" crunchy PB). I used a generous helping of PB and increased coconut milk by about a 1/2 can. \nTo the crock pot I added: 1 stick cinnamon and 4 dried lime leaves (Keffir if you can find), also kept those dried chiles in. Added 1 more large fresh garlic clove to pot with 1 hour of cook time left.  More optional pot adds: white pepper, tamarind paste, fresh lemongrass (I didn't have these on hand). When cooking is finished discard the chiles. \nSERVING TOPPINGS: try pickled ginger, cilantro or roasted peanuts. \nI chose to serve steamed broccoli and carrots on the side with this dish.  The whole dish was flavorful, rich and super delicious.  I will make it again!",
