I think I'd cut back on the ice next time and only use one packet of cocoa mix. I think maybe using two packets of instant coffee granules (I actually found a box of those individual packets at Grocery Outlet and each packet makes one cup of coffee. New one on me. Obviously.) and one packet of hot cocoa mix to get more of a mocha flavor. You really need to blend the heck out of this to get the hot cocoa and coffee granules to fully dissolve.",
