Grocery-store yogurt when blended turns to liquid which is what I forgot when making this. Far better to blend the feta and seasonings into a small bit of yogurt then gently stir in the additional yogurt. This is wonderful served with sliced fresh onion in it and a cucumber-tomato salad. Last note: This may be six servings but it does not serve six people!! (Unless each person is fine with only about 3 tablespoons of meat!) =)",
