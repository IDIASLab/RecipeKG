First, for a low calorie version, you can use 1/4 brown sugar baking splenda instead of 1/2 cup brown sugar, and use fat free mayonnaise instead of regular. About a month ago, I was playing around with this recipe and added 1 cup of craisins, 2 diced braeburn apples, and 2 broiled and diced chicken breasts. I took it for Mother's Day and everyone loved it, and although I still love the original recipe to go with a simple dinner of burgers, hot dogs, or sloppy joes, the updated version is my new favorite salad to take for pot lucks and to serve with pork chops.",

It has the perfect taste and texture for what I am using it for. At first the color kind of set me back (I'm from VA cole slaw is white there) but it will go well with the vinegary bbq. I followed another reviewers advice used a bag of the preshredded cabbage and halved the recipe. Perfect. I added maybe another tablespoon of mayo to thicken it up a little but other than that the flavor is great. It will be amazing once it's chilled. For the record anytime I make a salad (potato macaroni pasta slaw) it always needs to chill for awhile. If anyone is trying this recipe without chilling it first and giving it a bad review then try it again and let it sit for awhile. The flavors need to blend.",
