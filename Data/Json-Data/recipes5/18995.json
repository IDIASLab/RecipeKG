I didn't re-fridge the bread pudding over night but I did soak the bread for 10 mins and made sure the bread was fully soaked. I made half the recipe used all milk instead of adding heavy cream and also instead of having plane chopped apple for the top I added 1 tablespoon of butter (melted) 1 tbsp brown sugar 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Mixed it all together and spread it over the bread pudding. It came out tasty moist and perfectly sweetened. And instead of using nutmeg I used a all spice blend to give it more of a stronger spice taste. My husband ate half of it and he's not a fan of bread pudding. I will be making this again for sure.",
