I've twisted the traditional recipe by substituting Gouda for Gruyere, adding a splash of white wine to the cheese sauce, and building it on San Francisco-style sourdough bread. To make this sandwich into Croque Madame, top it with a sunny side up egg and a grinding of pepper. Enjoy!",

Instead, just use some sort of french loaf.\n\nFor those that are having issues with the sauce, what Sarah didn't point out in her original directions is that you are actually making a White Roux.  To help make it consistent and easy, heat the heavy cream and wine to just below boiling.  Then start melting the butter in another sauce pan.  Once the butter is melted, whisk in the flour and stir until the mixture begins to bubble.  Remove from heat and whisk in the hot cream and wine mixture.  Return to the heat and add cheese, stirring until the cheese is melted.\n\nBy heating the cream/wine first and insuring that the roux is bubbling, you should get a great sauce every time.",

Brought me back to junior year abroad in Paris and my favorite brunch place near the Tuileries.\n\nMy only comment to this recipe is the order of business - because of the delicate nature of making the cheese sauce & keeping it from separating, I would put the butter & mustard on the bread slices first and then, while the griddle or skillet is heating up, make the cheese sauce - then you can throw the bread, ham (I used mortadella), and cheese on right away.",

My son usually likes only American cheese but he doesn't take a pass on this one. I had no trouble with the cheese sauce separating - I just use a large whisk on it. I find the gouda about impossible to grate so I just cut it into small pieces. Ordinarily I would think that sourdough would be too strong a flavor but I use Pepperidge Farm and when grilled it adds just the right not too \"bitey\" flavor. This is a treat for the palate any way you slice it. The sauce would be excellent for many uses. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!",
