I always add extra spices to recipes and I did just that for this one. I added parsley oregano and basil sprinkling it on the chicken with the paprika salt and pepper. I also sprayed the top of the chicken with cooking spray to keep it moist. It took about 45 minutes to cook the chicken. The chicken was very moist and by itself was a little to much lemon juice but I mixed it with white rice and the flavors where perfect. I will def. make this again and would recommened it.",

Instead of white wine I used white zinfandel- this type of wine with chicken is awesome gives a very unique but delicious flavor. I would have used half the amount of lemon juice; I love lemon but I don't want it to be the main flavor of the dish- a little overpowering. I did not use a whole head of garlic and probably would have prefered it minced instead of sliced. No paprika. I used garlic powder instead. Other than that it was great!",
