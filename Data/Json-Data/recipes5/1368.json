Sometimes the flavor of a dish is the combination of ingredients not the added seasoning. I get so tired of reading reviews where a rating is given and they don't even come close to trying the original recipe. Especially when they change a bunch of ingredients and then rate it poorly. smh I used tri color quinoa and experimented with cooking it in the microwave so I could cook that part while getting ready. I would love to post how but I havent perfected it yet. lol BTW burnt quinoa is as bad as burnt popcorn.....take it outside. haha I added some salt to the cooking quinoa and to the egg and avocado. I have fresh blue eggs from my hens and avocado and feta are staples in my fridge. Quinoa is a nice alternative to the usual breakfast carb. I like the tri-color because it has different textures.",
