I think the addition of artichoke hearts and some freshly shredded parmesan would've been nice. Due to the nature of the consistency of all the cheese though you MUST serve it immediately to a hungry crowd. It starts thickening immediately and starts breaking chips quite quickly. That's not the recipe's fault just the result of so much melted cheese. Also if you make ahead as the creator suggested you can (which I did and she's right it's fine) keep in mind that you need to keep it in the oven a little while longer because you're having to heat up your dish and the cold center of the dip. This dip was a huge hit at our dinner party last night. Thanks!",
