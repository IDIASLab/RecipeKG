This is how I like it but I think I can speak for the majority and this is not what you consider chili. Secondly, this lacked in flavor and was in desperate need of at least salt.  I'm thinking with the exception of the chili beans that the other beans were supposed to be rinsed and drained? That would have thickened it up for sure. This was also very tomato forward and could have used more chili powder and spice. I will add things and make the leftovers edible but this one needs some mega tweaks and I will not bother making it again.",
