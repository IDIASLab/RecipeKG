I tried this with silken tofu because that's what I had on hand and it's fine but the regular kind is better--has a better texture. Mine took longer under the broiler than this recipe says--just go till it looks good. It has a a bit of a tang to it and I'm not sure if that's the vinegar in the marinade or the tofu itself. But it was good. Oh and I didn't use wine because I didn't have it so I use broth.",
