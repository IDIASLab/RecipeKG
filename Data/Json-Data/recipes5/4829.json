I do think the red pepper flakes it calls for was a little much so I halved it to 3/4 teaspoon and that was perfect. I did NOT add the pasta water. I thought the pasta water would dilute all the other favors and I'm glad I didn't add it. I was really able to taste the lemon, garlic, wine and butter with each bite. I may add a little more garlic and some lemon zest the next time I make this and see how that goes. Oh and I cut the red and yellow peppers with a tiny heart cookie cutter just for some fun.",

I was also out of red pepper flakes so I too a few whole dried red peppers and added them to the roux when the pasta was absorbing the liquid. They added just the right amount of pazazz. I took them out when I served of course. I dusted the dinner with a little Parmesian which is a no-brainer. But after dinner I thought it would be a good touch to drizzle on a little lime juice just before serving. Sliced black olives seem to make sense to me too.",
