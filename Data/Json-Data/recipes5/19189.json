The only variation I made to the recipe was to decrease the brown sugar by half.  Other than that, the only thing I did differently was to \"grill\" it in the oven @ 400 for about 20 minutes on a panini grill, rather than cooking it outside.  Although this recipe is not designated a \"fajita\" recipe, we found the flatiron steak with this marinade worked perfectly for that.  Thanks for this -- we highly recommend it!",

It is often described as having both the tenderness of a ribeye or strip steak while still having the full-flavored character of a sirloin or skirt steak. It has a large band of connective tissue running down the center that must be removed - hopefully by your butcher. Searing steak on the grill or stovetop (in the right size pan) and finishing in the oven is a very common method of preparation. Finishing the steak in the oven prevented the wonderful crust on the steak from burning on the grill. Excellent recipe this is a keeper.",
