Adjusted the amount of water and sugar to taste, but used the full amount of cinnamon called for. After the apples had cooked, I pureed the mixture  in the food processor. **Used this applesauce in \"Baked Oatmeal,\" which is also on this site. Used applesauce instead of the oil called for.**",

I scaled the recipe to make 8 servings, and used only 1 tsp. of cinnamon, instead of a tablespoon of cinnamon.  I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe calls for way to much cinnamon. I served this with vanilla ice-cream, and the tart apples with the sweet ice-cream was heaven!  Kind of like apple pie without the crust.  Great recipe!",
