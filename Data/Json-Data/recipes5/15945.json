However when I made them the second time I served them immediately and they still became soggy within a few minutes. I think this would work better if the layers were arranged in a horizontal dip and you just dragged the pretzel across. This way there would be no wait time.",

Regardless they are equally as good with or without the cheese. Five stars from both of us. I switched out the olive slice on some of them for jalapeno slices oh yeah. No need for a special occasion to enjoy these company worthy appetizers. Thank you lutzflcat for sharing this.",
