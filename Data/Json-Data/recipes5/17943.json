The filling was scrumptious but only 4 stars because I never had marjolaine before so not sure if it supposed to be like this. After refrigerating for 3 hours part of the puff pastry was getting a bit soft (which was something I thought may happen but was hoping for it to remain crisp) and I wasn't too pleased with that. Overall this was very delicious yummy. Thanks for sharing.",
