Ditched the rosemary used marsala wine as I didn't have the sherry on hand. I cubed the chicken breasts and after marinating I skewered them and cooked them right on top of my stove on my grill pan. Flavors were wonderful and the chicken carmarized beautifully. Served this with grilled yellow and green squash. Family loved this Ray and thanks!",
