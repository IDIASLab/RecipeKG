If I were to compare this to other \u201cnon-traditional\u201d Eggs Benedict, it\u2019s terrible and only worthy of one star. The reality is, it\u2019s just an egg on buttered toast and there is no comparison to a true Benedict style dish.  Non-traditional or not, to be classified as a Benedict it must include a sauce of some sort.  I thought the seasoned butter spread would be enough to compensate for omitting the sauce, but I was wrong.  Again, it\u2019s just buttered toast.  After several bites, hubby and I had enough.  I quickly whipped up some Hollandaise sauce and turned  this into a proper Eggs Benedict.",

The kids loved it. The husband loved it.  It also took about 10 minutes total to make, which was awesome.  Try to find a 10 minute meal as good as this. I have a feeling this might become a regular, and we're not the kind of family that has a rotation of meals. I need to work on my poaching technique, but I imagine that will improve with time.  Don't be afraid of it, because even ugly eggs taste good.  Add a nice vegetable to the side, and you've got dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!",
