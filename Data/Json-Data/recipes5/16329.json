This probably made the texture and taste of the bread even better than it was supposed to be but oh well. The finished loaf looked a little strange (It didn't quite fill out the whole bundt pan) but the taste was very very tasty and the texture was moist and very soft. It is a hit with my family and I'll be making it again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

I baked mine a little too long (25 minutes but I'm going to guess my oven bakes a little hot) so it more brown and has a crust unlike the one in the photo of the recipe. It's still good but better fresh from the oven or re-heated with butter/margarine. I think the recipe is called a 'cake' bread as the method of bringing together the ingredients (notably the ingredients in different amounts with others could be used to make a cake) and the fact that it is baked in bundt add to the 'cake' factor. This takes some time to rise though mine didn't rise much the second time (guess I didn't wait long enough) but it also doesn't bake up into the whole pan FYI. Had egg whites and sour cream to use wasn't disappointed.",
