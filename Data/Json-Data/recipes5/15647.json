But other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great! I was able to get 6 fully stuffed rolls out of this. Which was fine because I did lose a few noodles while cooking. My hubs really enjoyed these. I'll def be making again! I served with refried beans. I agree with the submitter....take the time to roll these up and everyone will be impressed!! I also used spaghetti noodles (broke down to toothpick size) to hold them together instead of the toothpick:)",

I seasoned my ground turkey with onion & garlic powder and oregano then I added the taco mixture when it was done browning. I used low sodium taco seasoning as this recipe seems awefully high in sodium. I couldn't bring myself to throw a glop of the salsa con queso on top of the already dry looking lasagna noodles so I diluted the queso with some milk covering the entire noodle. I ended up using only about half the jar. In retrospect I think heating the queso may have done the trick also. I will be making this again but I will try adding fresh cilantro to the meat mixture next time and maybe some sliced green onions on top to garnish. I served it with sour cream on top and salad. Very good!",
