They also do not fry well but are meant to be steamed or used in fresh spring rolls. Without even thinking I bought those kind on my first go around and they were a huge failure. I knew it as soon as they hit the oil. What you need is the ones that are more like egg roll wrappers and I'm certain that is what the recipe submitter intended here. I went out the very next night and bought all of the ingredients again but this time used egg roll wrappers (the right kind of spring ones were not available at the store) and they were a big success. I just had a leftover one that had been in the fridge all night and they held up nicely too. The filling is very good and it all goes together well. Shiitake's are expensive so they didn't make it into the 2nd batch but everything else stayed the same. I highly recommend these using the right wrappers. If you do happen to buy the wrong wrapper as I originally did I bet they would be good steamed like a potsticker.",
