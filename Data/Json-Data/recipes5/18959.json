I set it in the fridge in the morning and by afternoon the chicken was soaked with the flavorful liquid! A little more brown sugar at the end and in the broiler it went! Out came a delicious chicken dish! With the left over marinade I made a quick glaze which was a nice topping for the chicken! Thanks!",

It did take longer than 8 minutes under the broiler though but that didn't really bother me. It turned out great especially if you leave it under just a little longer to get a tiny bit of a burned edge. I found the sauce thickened once left standing it made a great sauce to dip the chicken in for more flavor. Thanks!",

When I first read the ingreds it sounded like they may not go together well but surprisingly it merged to make a nice taste as a whole. I personally found the amount of oils too much and so dimmed them down some.. I also put mandarin juice instead of orange juice but a little less than instructed(which REALLY improved the taste in my opinion) and then cut back a tiny bit on the italian spices. Definitely something different yet good enough to not be \"weird\" tasting. Will be making it again... So thanks for sharing your creation with us!",
