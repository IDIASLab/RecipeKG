Then, a few minutes before they were done, I transfered them into another pan dabbing off any grease onto a paper towel.  Then I poured the remaining sauce over them in the new pan.  It got rid of them sitting in the grease and the sauce didn't just bake onto the pan, it stayed on the wraps.",

Great reviews. I baked them in the oven and then drained them before putting the sauce over them.  I turned the oven off after putting the sauce on and left them sit in the oven another 15 minutes. I only made a half batch of the sauce and it was perfect for the amount of pineapple. After draining the bacon fat off, this is the perfect amount on top of the pineapple. My family loves these and request them often. ",

I used 3/4 cup chili sauce to 1/3 cup brown sugar and left out the mayo. The bacon made the dish greasy enough. After thirty minutes cook time I drained the pineapple wraps on a paper towel. Because of the grease I refreshed the foil liner in the baking pan then returned the pinapple wraps and brushed them with the sauce. I then broiled them for about 5 minutes to get a little more \"crisp\" going on. Hubby was my guinia pig. He LOVED them. I also experimented by wrapping whole water chestnuts and also wrapping shrimp. Nice contrast to the pinapple and also adored by my guinia pig. I do have to say that these are a little time consuming to make but can be made ahead then reheated before serving. I plan to serve all three at my daughter's engagment party. Great base of a recipe.
