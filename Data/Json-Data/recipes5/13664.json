I'd eat the whole tray if I had no self control! Here's how I did it: I boiled the lasagna first rinsed it with cold water and then laid it out on baking sheets covered with towels to get rid of excess liquid. While they rested I cooked the spinach (used a bag of frozen chopped) shredded the carrots (2 cups not 1 I would actually do 3 to 4 cups next time. We like carrots) I didn't have 45 minutes to roast garlic so I took the skin off of all of the cloves and roasted them in a pan. To speed the garlic process up i added about 3 table spoons or water to the pan and covered it to cook them threw. The water boiled off and then they roasted some more. I made Alfredo sauce next. That sauce is to die for. I would double that next time or maybe quadruple and use it as a dipping sauce for bread or to put on top of the lasagna while serving. It was so so good I cooked it exactly as directed and it came out perfect. Thank you! Happy family for dinner with plenty of leftovers.",

I forgot to add the red pepper flakes, which may or may not have been a mistake for church. I thought it was a little bland without them. I also used all heavy cream since our power had been off and I wanted to use the cream before it soured. I didn't have quite the required amount of ricotta, so I threw in a scoop of cottage cheese to make up the difference. The next time I make this I am going to cut the Italian seasoning down to half of what the recipe called for and add fresh basil instead.",
