I cut the chicken breasts in half and did not brown them. Chicken breasts tend to dry out fairly quickly. I then cooked them for 6 minutes instead of 11. They were perfectly cooked.\n\nI added an extra pound of mushrooms, an extra tbsp of tomato paste, and used better than bouillon instead of bouillon cubes. If you go the better than bouillon route you will need to add salt. Bouillon cubes are salty by themselves. \n\nFinally, after it was cooked I removed the chicken, turned the instant pot to saut\u00e9, reduced the sauce and added some corn starch to thicken it even more. I then shredded the chicken into large chunks and returned it to the sauce for about 2 minutes.\n\nExcept for the added mushrooms and tomato paste I did little to change the taste, and I have to say it was and is wonderful. It is great the first time you eat it and better the second and third time. \n\nA great recipe. Thank you.",

I followed the ingredients exactly, except that I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before browning.  I added in the tomato paste before adding in the chicken so I could stir it around easily to blend it in.  My chicken thighs were rather large (8-9oz) so I set the Instant Pot for 12 mins instead of 11. Once the cycle was done, I removed the lid and simmered on LOW for 5 more minutes since the chicken was a little underdone. I then removed the chicken and simmered the sauce an additional 10-15 mins to thicken it up, as suggested in the recipe notes.  The herbes de provence really make this dish! Absolutely DELICIOUS!",

Instead of chicken bouillon cubes, I started using Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base as it contains much less salt and seems to have more flavor. I also added a small jar of Mancini Roasted Peppers (drained). I also NEVER use QR (quick release) for any poultry or meat as I find the meat comes out tough & rubbery. I cancel the pressure, then let the pot sit & NR (naturally release pressure) 15-20min. With that said, this dish is wonderful served over garlic mashed potatoes or if keeping to a low carb diet, over mashed cauliflower. YUM!!  Thanks, Diana71. My family loves this!",

I did not brown the thighs, because they were frozen.  I mixed the tomato paste with the stewed tomatoes; placed the frozen chicken thighs on top of the tomato mixture.  I seasoned the chicken with the Herbes de Provence, and then piled the sauteed onion, celery, and mushrooms on top.  Then, added the water and 3 tsp. of Tones Chicken Base.  It was on the salty side, as I don't normally add much salt to my cooking.  I think I will try 2 tsp. of the Chicken Base.",

About 1.5 cups of chicken broth, 14 oz can of tomato sauce, 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes, and a 6 oz. can of tomato paste was mixed and dumped over the chicken.  Eleven minutes of high pressure, ten minutes of natural release, and ten minutes to reduce on sautee with the spices added. Delicious!
