Two of the cans of tomatoes with green chilis I used were \"extra hot\" (with two \"mild\") which has made some of my other recipes really spicy but I think the habaneros are the reason.

I was so surprised that not one other reviewer said anything about it. I can't eat much more than a couple of spoonfuls because it is unbelievably salty!!! I wish I hadn't put the taco seasoning in or the salsa. If I ever make this again I will definitely look for a healthy low salt salsa and find an alternative for the taco seasoning. I only used a half a pack. If you have hypertension your sodium intake should only be 1500 mg a day. One serving of this chili without any chips or anything else will be all you can have. If you don't then one an a half bowls will be your daily allowance for sodium.",
