I followed it exactly except omitted the poppy seeds. First the instructions didn't mention when to add the brown sugar even though it was in the ingredients list. I just put it in after adding the spices. I didn't think that 1/2 cup brown sugar alone made it sweet enough. I think some white sugar was needed. The bitter coffee was just too overpowering. We didn't like this at all. Even the sweetness of the fruit didn't help. I am very disappointed.",

Like the other reviewer said subbing ingredients was very easy. I subbed straight bran for the graham crumbs and the cereal. I added the flour last because I wanted to mix the baking powder with it. I only needed half of the flour listed or else I was afraid it would be dry. I did use the full amount of baking powder. They turned out very good. I don't know if I'd miss the white chocolate chips if I made them again especially since they kind of contradict the rest of the fairly healthy ingredients. I might be inclined to try making them again using orange juice for the liquid and chopped orange zest prunes in place of the chocolate chips.",

I used this recipe as a guideline in regards to proportions of moisture grain flour content and flavor but I streamlined the flavors to focus mostly on the mocha-spice angle. I thought there was so much \"going on\" in terms of flavors (coffee spices poppy apple raisins chocolate) that I tried to simplify the ingredients a bit. I modified it so much that I cannot make a judgement on the final taste of this recipe. I will say I used the same proportions of coffee and sweeteners plus 2 TBSP honey and there was a mildly bitter aftertaste that resembled cinnamon more than coffee. I didn't feel that the coffee overpowered the recipe at all and feel my muffins would be much better if eaten at breakfast with a cup of coffee- and I'm not really a coffee drinker. The only thing I might try next time is an additional egg in the batter. They were moist but somewhat crumbly and might hold together better with more egg.",
