Also we prefer spinach over lettuce to which I add a handful of chopped fresh cilantro and sometimes green onions. The dressing is stellar. Once I made the chicken extra spicy and added 2 Tablespoons of plain yogurt and 1 Tablespoon of mango chutney to the dressing to balance the flavors which was also really really good.",

I nixed the brown sugar because mango is sweet enough on its own and seasoned the chicken first with chili powder cayenne pepper and garlic then added some hot sauce to it. I diced some tomatoes red onions and cilantro to add to the avocado and mango added the lime juice and then topped with the chicken. Instead of iceberg lettuce which I find disgusting I used spinach. Came out great. The spicy savory taste of the chicken was nicely juxtaposed with the sweetness of the mango and the buttery avocado.",
