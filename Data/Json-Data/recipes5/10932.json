The flavor was great it was moist everything you want in a meatloaf. Our dinner guests (a whole family) were suitably impressed. The best part was I apparently didn't push the eyeballs in far enough and so when I tried to fix that after cooking meatloaf juice gooshed out from under the onions and looked DISGUSTING. LOL! Also everyone loved the blood sauce! We had both spicy and regular BBQ sauce so I mixed ketchup/spicy sauce/regular sauce in a 3:1:2 ratio added a dash of worchestershire and shook well in the squirt bottle.",
