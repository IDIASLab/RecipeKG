The most important thing is how it tastes and it was good but its presentation was a disappointment. I know I know this is purely aesthetics but we do eat with our eyes as well and I would never know that this was a veggie side dish if I hadn t made it. Followed the recipe to the letter except for letting it bake longer to brown the pastry crust and it was quite easy to prepare. The balsamic vinegar really comes through in this recipe giving the filling just a little tang and you ll definitely taste the feta as well both good things.",

I agree that this makes a lot so I cut it in half for just me and my husband and we still had leftovers. I also agree that the balsamic vinegar turns the entire filling an odd shade of brown and makes it look like ground beef (my husband even thought there was ground beef inside). Took close to 30 minutes for ours to get brown and puffy but like another reviewer mentioned it was a tad soggy in the middle (due to all the oil in the filling no doubt). Despite this I still found it to be pretty yummy and I'd try it again with a few minor tweaks.",
