I added 3 cloves of garlic (minced) which I sauteed with the onion and pepper, and I added a bit of Italian seasoning to the sauce.  After mixing everything together as in step 3, I put it in a casserole dish, sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top, and put it in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese. It was greatly enjoyed by my family, and was very easy to make.",
