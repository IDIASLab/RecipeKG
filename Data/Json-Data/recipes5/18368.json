I was looking forward to it but I really feel like it fell flat. I read some of the other reviewers recipes where they stated that the orange flavour wasn't terribly obvious. To try and circumvent this I added some apricot/mandarin jam. Even with this addition... it was still lacklustre. The other reviewers were right though. The meat was very moist. I liked that about this recipe. I think that the natural flavors of the dark turkey meat really overpowered the delicacy of the mandarins. I think that this marinade would be more appropriate with chicken or even white turkey meat. I may try again with this change as the marinade is quite good but chances are I will not make this again.",

The meat was very juicy tender and fell apart very nicely. No fighting to cut this one! I following other reviews added some orange juice to the recipe so the orange flavor resounded a little better. I believe that adding extract of orange would make the taste more prominent. The only reason I did not give this five stars is because the orange flavor did lack a little. I would highly suggest adding lots more orange to it. However even though the orange lacked a little the family all had second helpings and loved the recipe. This is well worth the frequent basting.",
