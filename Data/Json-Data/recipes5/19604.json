I am used to baking with whole wheat so I used 50/50 WW and AP which required the use of canola oil rather than butter as it works better with WW flour. This loaf was moist and bursting with spicy pumpkin flavor! I LOVED the ribbon of pumpkin butter running through the middle. I'm going to have to make some more pumpkin butter just to be able to make this recipe again. Thanks so much for sharing it!",
