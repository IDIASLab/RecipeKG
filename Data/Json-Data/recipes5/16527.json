Next time I make it I'm adding a little salt to the oatmeal mixture maybe 1/4 tsp and a little salt to the chocolate/peanut butter spread also probably 1/4 tsp. I agree with another reviewer that the vanilla could but cut in half. Also be sure to press down hard when \"patting\" the oatmeal mixture into the pan. Otherwise they will fall apart when you cut them. I tried the suggestion of coating with graham cracker crumbs (smashed a graham cracker in a ziplog bag then dropped a square in the bag and shook around) and it helped tremendously with the messy factor without changing the taste.",
