Unsure how to rate it since it's not that good as written but what are recipes anyway but good ideas to add to, right?!?! Ok agree with me later.  This soup is EXCELLENT when you add a palmful of brown sugar.  AND add extra pumpkin pie spices.  AND a sprinkle or 2 of cayenne pepper.  I used half-n-half and I ran outta onions, but did mince up some garlic.  I really love how it turned out. Taste as you go and for the love of G-d do NOT over-salt it.",

I accidentally forgot to add the cream and it was still delicious; BUT I thought it was just a tad too salty, and will halve the salt next time (i'm sure the kind of broth you use affects the saltiness, too). I doubled the ginger and cinnamon, and added a pinch of nutmeg. I think I will follow other reviewers' advice and add about 1/4c brown sugar (or maybe maple syrup?!) next time, and maybe try topping with toasted pumpkin seeds?? The croutons were definitely a great touch to this recipe. I only had a loaf of french bread, so sliced that into 1/2 inch rounds and toppped that with the cinnamon sugar mixture and it was still great (although I think the wheat would've been better). VERY EASY TO MAKE! THANKS.",

I DOUBLED the recipe as given with the following adjustments: (1) Did NOT make the croutons (2) Used unsalted homemade chicken broth (3) Used total of 3 cans of pumpkin puree (4) Used total of 1 1/4 cups heavy cream (5) Used 3 teaspoons salt for total recipe (6) Added 1/2 tsp. Penzey's Chipotle ground red pepper (7) Added 1/2 tsp. Penzey's Ancho Chili pepper ground (8) Added 2 extra good shakes of cinnamon (9) Added fresh ground nutmeg (approx 1/4 tsp.) (10) Used an immersion blender right in the pan rather than pouring into a blender. This was a rich and delicious savory soup. It actually tastes even better the next day. I would suggest you start with only 1/4 tsp. of the Chipotle and Ancho ground peppers and taste and adjust according to your preferences.",

I went easy on the onion after other reviews and it was perfect (although I can see how it could easily be too oniony). To lower the fat I substituted the cream with 1/2 cup half-and-half and 1/2 cup 1% milk and it was plenty rich (could probably get away with all 1% milk next time). I didn't have time to try the croutons but the soup was just fine on its own (especially as a first course). This is GREAT and easy recipe - THANK YOU!",
