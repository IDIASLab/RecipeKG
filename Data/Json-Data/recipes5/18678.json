I had the batter ready and had to wait for the griddle to finish heating. The batter did come out a little thin. I cooked them that way and they turned out fine if just a little flat. Next time I will start with more cornmeal probably a quarter cup or more extra. The cooking time seemed to need to be a little longer than regular pancakes. The first two I made turned out a little doughy. I started leaving them on the griddle for a few extra minutes after they looked done and the rest all came out perfect. The taste was very good but I was hoping it would taste a little more like corn bread. The corn flavor was definitely there but was a little more subtle than I would have liked. This is something that the extra cornmeal will hopefully also help with.",

We cooked them on medium heat for less than 8 minutes; I liked them golden brown and they tasted a little burnt when they were dark brown. Note: When it says let rise in FRIDGE overnight don't try to leave it on the counter or you will have a mess (we didn't lose much). Great with maple syrup and/or peanut butter.
