You can serve any number of toppings with this dish to make it a complete meal.\n I used 93/7% ground beef and still had grease. I will rinse the meat after browning the next time I make it. \nThe bottom of the rolls were a little doughy, next time I will place the pizza stone in the oven while it is preheating just to warm up the stone.\nI used 2 tablespoons Taco Seasoning 1 from this website and added 1 tablespoon as thickener.\nI also made and used Chef John's Creme Fraiche recipe from this site.\nThanks for a great recipe to satisfy our taco cravings!",
