Substituted Barilla's 4 cheese sauce & used tomato soup instead of cream of chicken. Not all the quinoa could fit if I wanted everything else to. Have about 2 cupsleft for another dish (fine with me!) Makes a lot and was delicious!! Will try it again usng the alfredo sauce",

It did make a lot so I had a lot of leftovers. I could probably cut the recipe in half for 4-5 people. When you see quinoa in a recipe you think healthy But there is a lot of cheese and oil and butter so that erases the healthy part. But it was very tasty. I would make it again.",
