Having added ingredients, I had to add extra eggs and added extra bacon, well, because: it's bacon. I changed up the method too. I cooked the bacon in a skillet then used the bacon grease to cook up the veggies, instead of using butter. The timing was about the same. The muffins were ready in 25 minutes. Thank you for the recipe.",
