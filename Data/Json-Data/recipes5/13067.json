I did have to make a few adjustments to get it to our tastes but this is a definite repeat with a few minor changes. First problem I had was the thickening (Wondra/water) did not thicken it nearly enough. I corrected that with 4 more tablespoons of wondra to some cream and let it cook the last hour. It did taste a bit underseasoned for our taste so I added about 1 teaspoon of thyme and a pinch of sage. I did not have brocolli so I had to forgo that. Next time I would add more carrots than potatoes but that is my personal taste. I have a newer crock pot that cooks pretty hot so this could have been done in three hours so adjust recipe to the newer & hotter slow cooker standards. I forgot to turn the dumplings but it came out great in spite of me :)  Thanks so much for sharing a delicious and simple recipe jterrij. This recipe is a wonderful tribute to your mama. UPDATE:I made this again today using leftover rotisserie chicken & my homemade chicken stock. I made the biscuit mix from AR ( http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Homemade-Biscuit-Mix/?prop31=9) and reduced it to 12 servings to make the dumplings making this even more budget friendly. I threw in some mushrooms and a glug of white wine. This recipe is so easy and versatile and I will use it for years to come.",
