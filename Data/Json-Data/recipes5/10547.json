I oven baked my bacon, patted it dry with paper towels and then diced/crumbled it.  I then put the bacon in a saute pan with the veggies and a TINY bit of olive oil.  I added the cayenne pepper to taste and I bet I ended up with more like 1/4 tsp. of cayenne (and it was not too spicy).  Corn is not yet in season, so I used one can of shoepeg white corn (niblets) and the ratio to the rest of the relish was perfect.  We grilled a 2-1/2 pound filet of salmon and this was just enough relish for that size.  For a larger piece of salmon, I would have to double the relish.  Everyone loved it!",

I did not have access to a grill, so I cooked the fish in the oven.   Here is how I did that:  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.   Melt about 3 Tablespoons of butter in a glass baking dish in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes. Season the flesh side of fish with dried basil. Place the fish skin-side up in the hot butter and bake for about 4-5 minutes.  Remove from oven and peel off the skin.   (If it does not easily pull off, it is not ready - put back in oven for a couple of minutes.).  After peeling off the skin, season that \"skin side\" with salt and pepper.  Turn fish over and season the herbed side with salt and pepper.  Return to oven for 4-5 minutes or until slightly underdone.  (The fish should flake easily with a fork, but slightly opaque.  It will continue to cook after removing from oven. ).   It was so yummy!",
