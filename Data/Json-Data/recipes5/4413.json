The lemon starts \u2018cooking\u2019 the fish, which once baked, turns the fish mushy instead of flaky. The coriander gave quite a different flavor. This ingredients and cooking method somehow accentuated the fishiness of the tilapia, which I didn\u2019t care for. A few minutes under the broiler at the end would add a bit of color to the fish. I prefer parmesan-crusted or fried tilapia, but agree this is healthier.",
