I didnt have all the individual spices on hand so I just used pumpkin pie spice (1 1/2 tsp). I didn't use store-bought polenta but instead made my own homemade. And while I had to let it bake for longer than 45 mins (total time of 1 1/2 hours) it was a fantastic flavor and really great for my low-calorie/low-fat lifestyle. I can see a lot of things to do with this recipe but it is a great start. Thanks for sharing your idea! Jules",

I changed the brown sugar to 1/4 cup agave syrup and instead of eggs and egg whites I just used 4 eggs. I didn't know whether to expect something like Indian pudding or a pumpkin cornbread; but I think it was like a combination of the two. With whipped cream this could easily be a dessert as it is it's like cornbread that. goes with soup! Great recipe!",

In many places not North America polenta is the name for plain dry cornmeal. In other countries (like Canada where I am from) polenta is a dish made from boiling yellow cornmeal; you can buy it precooked in tubes. If you use the precooked stuff this recipe will come out a little different: imagine making oatmeal cookies with oat porridge.",
