        "description": "I learned This dish from my mother and I am eternally grateful for everything she taught me..actually I am a brinjal hater before and I never wanted to taste this ever in my life. Years passed and after my marriage I wanted to try this for my darling and I made it as per my umma's instructions. It was a hit dish and everyone loved it in my family. When I tasted it, I really loved the flavor and taste and wanted to share it here. The main highlight of this dish is mainly sour taste of tamarind. If you are looking for quick south Indian meal ideas, this could be one of the choices.",

The next time I make it I will use smaller Indian eggplants for a firmer texture. I reduced the chile powder to 1 teaspoon because that is about as much heat as I can handle. Thank you Aysha Shifna for sharing your recipe.",
