This recipe was a slight challenge for me (I couldn't quite get my timing right). I personally wasn't a huge fan of the dijon sauce a little extra sweetness would have satisfied my taste buds a little more. My variations from the recipe: I cooked my salmon for about 2.5 minutes per side I would recommend this for a fish lover. The grocery store I went to was out of lemons so I bought oranges this worked very well on salmon not sure how I liked it in the dijon sauce. I added too much water to the asparagus which resulted in my overcooking the veggies. It made them very mushy which worked out well enough I guess. My noodles were a little dry next time I will add more butter or maybe an alfredo sauce. Overall this recipe was very fun and satisfying.",
