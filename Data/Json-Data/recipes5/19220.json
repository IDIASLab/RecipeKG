Instead we poured it over the chicken and rice. I think in the future I would cut back on the rice vinegar by about 2 Tbs. (The vinegar flavor was a little too intense.) I'd also either cut back on the cornstarch or add more water as it got a little too thick. After a few minor adjustments this would be a great recipe!",

We eat Asian quite often but this was my first attempt cooking it(other then stirfry) Used this recipe because it was crispy we were not disappointed easy to follow urned out great. The ingredients were easier to find then i expected as well. The sauce does have an intense vinegar flavor otherwise i would have given it five stars. Also when i made it we were out of corn starch i subed flour and cut back a little since people said it was to thick my consistency was right on! I also took the spiciness up a notch extra chile paste and red peperfakes..we like it HOT! Next time gonna reduce vinegar and use the crispy chicken section with the sauce from the other kung pao recipe for fun. But this is good...worth trying!",

I added the ginger and garlic after the meat had browned and veggies were to my liking as not to allow them to burn up. I cut the vinegar down to 2T but added some of chicken water (1/3 cup)along with the rest of the ingredients to make this more saucy; we served over white rice. The combination of the sweet tangy and spicy made this awesome! I will continue to make this recipe this way!:)",
