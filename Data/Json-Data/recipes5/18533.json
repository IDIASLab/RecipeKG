I add green peppers which I puree with the onion (since I don't want it to liquidy I use only half of each). I leave out the ketchup and barbeque sause. and I add dry beefy onion soup mix (which I strain and add the onions to to the top). It comes out wonderful! The brown sugar makes it so sweet and tasty. I will make this again and again!!!",
