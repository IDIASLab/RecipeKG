I baked them for 35 mintues instead of 45. Perfectly cooked. My husband and I both enjoyed! Thank you!",

My Dad taught me to make it when I was a teenager and he never measured anything. I guessed that it would be 1 cup but I know that's too much.  The brown sugar does add a good flavor to the kraut but use whatever you think is enough. I always use the fresh kraut found in a clear plastic bag in the cold meat section.  Thank you for all the reviews and I hope you enjoy this family favorite.",
