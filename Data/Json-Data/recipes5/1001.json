I did use buttermilk in the icing only because I had a touch left that I had to use. This was just what I needed--thanks Cara! NOTE: This recipe does not say to sift the powdered/confectioners sugar. I really didn't mess with that but I did run a wisk through it to break down the bigger lumps in the sugar. It just makes for a smoother icing. For those like me who forget to let the cream cheese sit out before using, I let the cream cheese sit in a small bowl on my heating pad (the same one I used to help my rolls rise) on low/medium for 20 minutes or so to soften it up.",

I used a 3 oz. pkg. of cream cheese and decreased the amount of butter a bit. Since I only had skim milk on hand I opted to my husband's half and half. Definitely make sure your butter and cream cheese are softened. I gradually put everything into my kitchen aid mixer and gave it a whirl. This came out so smooth and creamy -perfect for Sunday morning cinnamon rolls. These frost about 12 large rolls, but then again I LOVE icing! Thanks for a great recipe, Cara M.!",
