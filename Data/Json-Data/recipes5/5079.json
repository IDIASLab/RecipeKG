For the most part I did, however, I did use a smidge less Old Bay and lemon zest, and omitted the garlic since I used 2 T. of crushed, buttery garlic croutons in place of the \"buttery round (i.e., Ritz) crackers. For color interest, texture and extra flavor I added a couple tablespoons of finely chopped sweet red bell pepper. I didn't measure the lemon juice, just gave it a good squeeze. I found it needed NO salt.  This tinkering is only a reflection of personal taste, and not a criticism of the recipe which I'm sure is find as it stands.  I do have a criticism, however, and that is that the size of the lobster tail is not indicated, which could greatly affect the cooking time!  We used four (6 oz.) tails, and Hubs baked them for 15 minutes! Any larger tail would have required longer cooking time - this recipe directs 10-12 minutes, but for what sized tail?  Very good recipe overall.  Hubs particularly enjoyed it, while I will always be a fan of strictly broiled lobster tail with hot drawn butter.",

It's amazing heaped on bread and toasted which was the next day's indulgent breakfast. Possibly beacuse of how much stuffing I used it took about 15 minutes for the tails to completely reach 145 degrees. By this time the crab was a little crusty on top and we loved it. It wasn't burnt at all - just gave a nice counterpoint to the tender tail meat. If you have never used this technique to lay the tail meat on top don't be scared off by it. It isn't terribly difficult. The meat will stick a little to the shell on top. I find it easiest to loosen the meat from the bottom first and then wiggle my finger slowly around until it's free. Any meat still clinging to the shell is easy to get after cooking.",

(Not the 4 if I had quadrupled it).I tasted it then and decided that it was perfect without adding more. I also only doubled the salt - Old Bay was salty enough. It was easy to make for a crowd and it looked like I had spent all day in the kitchen! Made it earlier in afternoon and refrigerated till ready to pop in oven",
