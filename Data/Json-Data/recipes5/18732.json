The second time we were out of oat bran so he substituted with regular wheat bran and it came out delicious both times. We also used sliced almonds instead of sunflower seeds (we were out of those too) which still were delish! We used reg choc chips the first time around and white choc chips the second time. We doubled the peanut butter and the banana which made them still turn out fine and we pressed the cookies down with a fork before baking. We might add some flax seed meal next time.
