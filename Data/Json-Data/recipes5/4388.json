I know I usually do. Finally, if you want your asparagus super tender and you have the time and the patience, use a vegetable peeler and peel the asparagus (not the head) before you boil it. This especially works if your asparagus is very thick. If you are not sure where to cut off the bottom end of your asparagus, just grasp hold of the top and bottom of your stalk and bend it from the bottom until it breaks. The asparagus will break at the spot where the tough ends and the tender begins. Enjoy!",

Although the presentation was nice and everyone liked the cold asparagus I noticed that everyone tossed the prosciutto (including me) and nobody went back for seconds which left me with a lot of left-overs that we tossed. Disappointing. The meat was obviously a turn-off and even though I gave my asparagus a \"bath\" in lemon juice it barely picked up any of the flavor. Note: if you decide to try it - make sure you barely blanche the asparagus. Based on another review I kept mine in for almost 5 minutes and the tops turned to mush which didn't look very nice.",
