Next time I'll use less vinegar and I'll use grape juice in stead of the very expensive pomegranate juice - I'm sure you wouldn't taste the difference. Also I didn't read the recipe properly and cut the sweet potato into fairly small chunks but it was just right; any larger and it would have been undercooked. Unlike the previous reviewer my chicken browned nicely (skin side up above liquid) and the dish looked lovely with the green onion and pomegranate seeds over.",
