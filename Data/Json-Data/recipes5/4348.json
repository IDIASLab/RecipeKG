I have to say i loved the mint in the mix it was delish. the only thing i found was that we used the metal skewers for some and because we could not find all of them we cooked some of the strips in foil on grill. Once the salmon was cooked it was nice and flakey and hard to remove form skewers without crumbling. next time i will just use the foil. thanks for a great recipe",
