It actually enhanced the flavor of the soup, in my opinion. I used 3/4 cup of grass-fed butter instead of 1/2 cup. I used Bella mushrooms, they seem to have a firmer texture. This soup is sooo yummy. Will definitely be making this again!!!",

I made a few substitutions, like coconut oil for half of the butter and coconut cream for 3/4 of the heavy cream (only used 1/2 cup of cream, with 1 1/2 cups of coconut cream) since my goal was to make it a little healthier and hopefully not lose the wonderful flavor. It worked. I might even try all coconut cream next time. I didn\u2019t have time to run out and get the fresh tarragon, but happened to have a nice  dry Parisienne mix of chives, dill weed, basil and tarragon. We added some fresh spinach, just before serving. Will definitely be making again.",
