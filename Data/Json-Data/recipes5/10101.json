You can use any meat you would like... Just make sure you cut it thin if you use fish or shrimp use due care. A Soy ginger salad dressing can take the place of those two ingredients. I have made this recipe several time using Spaghetti Squash it is a fantastic alternative to the egg noodles I actually prefer it. I hope these suggestions help... I would also recommend using crunchy peanut butter! Enjoy!",

I did like the spiciness of it, and love the curry!  If I made this again I would decrease the peanut butter to a tablespoon or so, and use a thicker, sturdier noodle & perhps some chicken broth for more liquid.

I would recommend to reduce the amount of red pepper unless you have a really high tolerance for spicy food. I made this receipe with a few modifications. I used regular egg noodles instead of chinese egg noodles and vegetable oil instead of peanut oil. I used 1 TBSP of ground ginger and ground red pepper instead of pepper flakes. Instead of carrots water chestnuts and mushrooms I used 1/2 a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables. Will definately make again!",
