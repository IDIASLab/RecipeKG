Since I didn't have a pkg of taco seasoning on hand, I did have some taco seasoning which I added to the tomato sauce (to taste), and I used 2C of grated cheese as we really like cheese.  Didn't have fresh red bell pepper, so used jarred roasted red peppers on my half.  We gave this recipe an \"A\"!!  Thanks!",
