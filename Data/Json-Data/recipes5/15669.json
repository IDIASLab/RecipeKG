I roasted them in the oven beforehand, let them cool, and removed most of their skin and they were mmm mmm good. I think I will add black beans or corn the next time I make them and also sub the colby jack ( I used a colby blend this go around because that is all my store carried) for cheddar or mexiblend. As written I give these a 4 but with the sub of poblanos I give it a 5 all the way. Thanks for sharing Jasgirl!",

All ingredients I used as per the recipe except for omitting the salt since I think the taco seasoning has plenty of salt.  I cooked the ground beef separately since we have a vegetarian and mixed the beef with the other ingredients together after filling her peppers.  I put the raw rice and the proper amount of water along with all of the other ingredients in one pot and simmered them all together.  The rice absorbed all of the other flavors beautifully.  I spooned tomato sauce on top of each pepper then topped with taco style cheese.  What a hit!!  I'm sure they'll be asking for this all the time!  P.S. the peppers were from the garden!  May try banana peppers or jalepenos next time!",

I only used one can of tomato sauce in the meat and instead of topping with the other I topped with Rotel Original version. I will use a bit less water next time since the meat mixture turned out a bit soupy...good, but soupy. I put the peppers in the slow cooker and put on low for 4 hours. I have a picky family and they loved these. Oh yeah, I put three hunks of colby/jack in the top of each pepper the last hour. Excellent!",
