I cut a pork loin into chops and a roast and brined it all in the brine solution - freezing the chops for later. The marinade / sauce can be made ahead of time. I made it according to the instructions except I didn't have peanut oil so I used sesame oil. I rinsed the pork loin after removing from the marinade and placed it in a bag with less than half the marinade / sauce. Squeeze the air out of the bag and back into the refrigerator. I cooked the loin indirect on the grill to 140 - took off and tented. Served with grilled pineapple red peppers and Jasmine rice. The meat itself is not spicy the sauce / marinade is. Serve the sauce on the side. Thanks for a fun recipe that made my hubby very happy.",
