Suggetions would be to cut coriander amount by half since it dominates the flavor. If you still want more than put in a little at a time. People have reported texture being more soupy than chili like but that is probably because they didn't notice that the recipe gives you a general amount for water. Use your own discretion: pour a little in at a time until satisfied with consistency. I found this out the hard way after dumping it all in.",

Instead of using ground cayenne pepper I substituted Frank's Red Hot Original sauce (I just kind of eye-balled the amount and tasted as I went). It's main ingredient is cayenne peppers so I imagine it made the chili taste very similar to the original recipe but perhaps a little bit more tangy. I think I'll try adding some tomatoes and possibly play around with some peppers or other vegetables next time. I also made some cornbread to go along side of it which was the perfect addition. Can't wait to taste the leftovers!",

The flavor starts out spicy and you don't think it's too hot but once you swallow you about choke and your eyes start watering. Too much spice and this from someone that likes spicy stuff.
