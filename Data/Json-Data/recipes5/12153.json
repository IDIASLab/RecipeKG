I did follow the tip about using a larger pan - I used a ceramic lasagna pan and it fit great.

Family loved it and only requested that I add more Italian sausage. Obviously I left out the ricotta. Oh and I added lots of garlic. Took some to another family and child there wanted to know why my lasagna was better than his mom's. Guess I have learned that everyone doesn't like ricotta. Wonderful recipe!",
