Also, I added a cup of wine to the 2 cups of water in bottom of pan, which enhanced the flavor of the au jus. Will probably use chili powder with a little more \"zip\" next time for added spice (used mild this time). Final note: Pull your roast just before you think you should, then let it sit as recommended. Meat keeps cooking even after it's removed from oven, and you can always cook longer if it's too rare, but you can never uncook it. Overall, this is a must-try if you enjoy flavorful, delectible prime rib!!",

I added all the ingredients together and by the time I got too the soy sauce I'm wondering why do I need another 1/2 cup of chili powder. So I added the blackened seasoning to the bowl and added 1/3 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/4. Then I splashed enough water in it to desolve the sugar and wet the seasonings. I also did't separate the meat from the bone. I poured the mixture over the meat. It was very thick and clung nicely.I let it sit in the fridge for an hour then I cooked it as directed to 145 and was quite pleased with the result. I will definitly use it again and I will try it on pork spare ribs.",

I followed directions and the spices formed a crust which we peeled off before carving. Such a great flavor all the way through to the middle hardly anyone used Au Jeus spell or horseradish! You know its great when all you hear is MMMMMMMM Chewing and clancking silverware! Read one review that said it wasnt flavorful enough she must have really messed up because I have had Prime Rib from everywhere its my favorite and this is definately the most flavorable recipe I have had! It was hard the first time to put that much chili powder on a 150 roast but am I ever glad I did! I recomend following recipe exactly at least the first time chill overnight and remove from fridge 1 hour before cooking. Cook to your liking! ENJOY- 6 Stars",
