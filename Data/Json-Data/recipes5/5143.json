I followed the cooking directions on my instant rice as it called for nearly twice the water of minute rice brand. As summer hits I don't care to stand over a boiling pot for 45 minutes so I generally switch to instant rice. This is a nice way to dress it up and I used the author's suggestion of changing the herbs and juice to go with our meal. I used a dry cilantro a small amount of ground coriander and lime juice as the subs. This was pretty good cooked itself while I was outside and went well with our grilled tropical chicken and fruit salsa. My only disappointment was that the lime juice and cilantro didn't really come through as much as I'd like. I would use fresh cilantro next time and a little more lime juice.",
