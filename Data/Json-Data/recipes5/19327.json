Also, dont' be tempted to use relish instead of the pickles to me it's just not the same!  I also think next time I'll bake this without the sauce on top first so I can get the nice crust then for the last 10 min or so add the glaze.  I also forgot to add the salt (ooops just skipped it by accident) but I really don't think it needs the salt.  ",

I didn't have Worcestershire (SP?) sauce so I instead added a bit of onion soup powder to the meat and the sauce on top to flavor. I didn't add any extra salt because I was using very salty (Israeli) pickles. I cooked this in a long loaf pan and I knew it was done when the meatloaf pulled away from the ends of the pan. (I'm not sure if it's supposed to do that but the meatloaf itself tasted perfect!) I'll definitely be making this again!! I was so impressed by the flavor... I would never have known the meatloaf had pickles in it but it definitely has a little \"zing.\" Also I like the fact that there is no added cheese or oil so this is at least marginally healthy! I served with mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans with garlic... a delicious and easy all-American dinner.:)",

My husband ate over half and my son thought it was really great it just wasn't a hit with me or my littlest. I really was pulling for this recipe. I'd like to play with it a bit and see if I can't get it a little more solid. Maybe make it a base for a Cheeseburger Meatloaf? I'm sorry. I really tried.",
