Guests even raved how much better they were than a couple of well known German restaurants in Columbus Ohio. I am guilty of making some minor modifications. I used more onion than the recipe called for as well as honey mustard and black pepper. I used the refrigerated sauerkraut in a plastic bag and hand sqeezed all the liquid from the kraut (don't rinse). A chef on T.V. once said that the only use for \"dried\" parsley is for garnish. I used fresh cilantro since my local store ran out of fresh parsley. Also use a couple of fresh garlic cloves instead of garlic salt and add a little salt. I doubled the recipe and used a 1oz scoop to form the balls (30ct). I was worried that placing them in a crock pot would make them soggy. It worked fairly well. Simply place papertowels on the bottom and then place paper towels between each layer with the crockpot on warm setting.",

Never even thought to make them before until a recent ball-themed snack party. I tried variations of this recipe and determined that you can substitute about a clove or so of garlic for the garlic salt (this dish doesn't need any extra salt). Definitely WASH the kraut and drain well even squeezing out the excess water with your hands. Careful on the amounts of onion and garlic as both can overpower the taste of the balls. I added about a teaspoon each of fresh thyme and oregano at the end of cooking the sausage and added a T or two of fresh Italian parsley before mixing up the balls. Caraway seeds are a good addition too. Chilling the mixture in the freezer for 15 min. before balling makes it so much easier. Used buttermilk in the coating for extra flavor. Did half with Panko instead of crumbs but you could barely tell the difference both in look and taste. Frying was key to a crispy coating but these reheat very well in a hot oven or toaster oven.",
