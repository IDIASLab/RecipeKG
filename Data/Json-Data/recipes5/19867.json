That said I came across the Praline Sweet Potato recipe here about 8 years ago and have been making it every Thanksgiving & Christmas until yesterday. This year I decided to find a recipe not so 'desserty'. This Apricot-Pecan Sweet Potato recipe fit that need perfectly!!! I made the sauce the night before to save some time. I immediately fell in love!! I got out some vanilla ice cream and poured some on....heaven. I couldn't wait to try it on the potatoes next day. There was too much sauce since I don't make much in the way of SPs. So I have more leftover sauce for ice cream Yay! I added the pecans after pouring the sauce on the potatoes and popped it in the oven. So easy!! So FAST! So delicious!! Not overly sweet or heavy. I'll be making this sauce many times during the year as well!",
