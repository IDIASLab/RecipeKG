I used dill rather than oregano for its milder more subtle flavor and marinated the chicken for just over three hours. I sliced them up and served them over a big tossed green salad with a homemade Barbecue Ranch dressing. Hubs made a point of mentioning that he generally doesn't like marinades but that this was a \"make again\" - but he said I never \"make it again\" when he tells me to \"make it again.\" This was so easy and so good that I will have to make a point to please him and make it again.",

And it sat marinating overnight instead of 8 hours it turned out to be more like 14 hours. The taste was strong which I like but you could still get the chicken flavor. Will definitely make this again in the future.",
