Cover the area with parchment paper where you plan to knead, cover that with 3/4 cup flour (but keep an additional 1 3/4- 2 cups on hand in a bowl) and add to that from bowl as needed. Then knead dough directly with rolling pin. Wax paper between rolling pin and dough is not necessary.  I found no \u201cDuncan Hines Moist Deluxe Spice Cake\u201d mix at neither Target nor Market Street. But at the latter, I did find Duncan Hines Signature Spice Cake mix. All errors considered, I\u2019d still make this recipe again as it was very tasty. However, personally, I preferred the cookies that I didn\u2019t roll out as thin as 1/4 in. because I like them more soft than crunchy.",
