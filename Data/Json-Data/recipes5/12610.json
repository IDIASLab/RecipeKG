Secondly, as written this was way too  watery to eat right away. I had to let it cool for 20 minutes before it ever started to thicken. I also felt the taste was watered down. I'd recommend cutting back on the water but you may need that much to cook the pasta so I don't know? This is an okay recipe but probably not one I'd make again.",
