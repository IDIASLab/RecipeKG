I used reduced fat mayonnaise and because I was using homemade italian seasoning in the coating for the chicken I used white wine vinegar in this recipe. (I wasn't really sure that rice wine vinegar would go well with italian seasoning to be honest). It was absolutely perfect--just enough to coat four halved chicken breasts and it made the chicken wonderful. My husband and kids inhaled the chicken dish. I'll use this recipe again and again.",
