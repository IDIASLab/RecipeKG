I used old fashioned oats in place of quick and I added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon for flavor.  I followed the recipe for everything else.  These are better than any store bought granola bar for sure!  Make sure you spend enough time mixing the mixture so that it is evenly coated.  I thought I might have the crumbly problem at first but I just kept mixing and they came out perfect!",

They were quite yummy, although a bit crumbly as others mentioned and could have been a bit more flavorful.  I really liked how not messy they are to make, too.  I just made these again this week, except used honey instead of corn syrup, made  a bit more of the sugar concoction  and used those Florida Natural fruit snacks instead of raisins.    Prepared this way, the granola bars hold their shape quite well and taste  fantastic.  My boyfriend almost died when he had the first bite and I suspect I'll be making them weekly now.  Update 7/07: I use this recipe more than any other recipe EVER!  I guess we like things sweet, but I always use 2/3 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup honey and 2/3 cup peanut butter.  Perfect for us. I also just dump the mixture onto a cutting board after getting it all mixed up and shape it into a square with my hands, let it set, cut them up and individually wrap in foil. I've tried lots of dried fruits in them and they're all great, usually use cranberries.  I'm going to try adding cinnamon next time!  THANKS!",

                "reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIPS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS: I found it easier to use my hands and not a spoon to flatten and pack together in a pan.  Honey makes all the difference instead of the oil.  Then I placed it in the fridge for an hour, cut in squares, and placed each one in plastic wrap for easy grabbing.  Store at room temperature as they get dry/not chewy if left in the fridge.  I can't believe how good these are.  I do agree with the poster who used 2/3 C of everything (raisins, brown sugar, honey, pb) instead of 1/2 C.  Makes a huge difference!!!!  I also sprinkled some pecan pieces (NOT crushed, just chopped a tad) OR sliced almonds ...about 1/4 - 1/3 a cup, & it was the perfect combination!  I used a bag of raisin/cranberry mix instead of JUST raisins.  You can really make this colorful w/your choice of fruits for the holiday season!  I don't allow my kids to have chocolate, but I can easily see why others insert m&m's in these. Just be sure to add them last so they don't melt!",

Used whole oats--but soak it in just enough hot water to soften it up (but don't add so much that it becomes watery)\n3. Original recipe was a bit too sweet, so I used slightly less than 1/2c brown sugar on my next batch.\n4. Use wheat puffs instead of rice.\n5. Add 2 Tb. flax.\n6. Use around 2/3 c lowfat peanut butter to make batch stickier and to eliminate any crumbliness.\n7. Press finished batch firmly to hold it in place.\n8. Add some pumpkin spice or cinnamon.\n9. Use nuts or other fruits in place of raisins---be creative! I used soy nuts, pine nuts and baked pears---delicious!\n...enjoy!",

If you look at the other recipes on this site they are basically all the same. I used Special K because I couldn't find Rice Crispies. I also ran out of oats so I just topped it up with choc chip muesli. And instead of raisins I put chopped almonds because my daughter doesn't like raisins. As others have done I am going to try honey next time. Tip: if the mixture hardens while mixing just put it in the microwave for 20 seconds and continue. It was not easy to mix. I lined the pan with a big piece of foil filled in the mixture folded the foil over and used my hand to press it down firmly and evenly. Therefore I did not have sticky hands a sticky pan or a crumbly mixture like others have experienced.",

Fill the 1/2 cup 3/4s full of the light corn syrup and add a little honey to get to a full 1/2 cup - it helps the bar stick together better (don't use more or it turns out too sweet).  Also add a 1/4 tsp of salt - don't know why but it makes a world of difference in the taste in a good way.  Thank you so much for this easy delicious recipe.",

These went together super fast and I like the cereal/oats combination and unlike alot of granola or granola bar recipes there isn't alot of sugar so they are healthier and less expensive to make. I made the first batch as directed the second minus the raisins and pressed mini chocolate chips on top and in the third I replaced 1/2 cup of cereal with coconut and added finely chopped dried apricots.

These were very good but they just wernt overly flavorful as prepared in the actual recipie. I found adding cashews crushed sunflower seeds chocolate chips and raisins helped a lot. Good basic recipie. First few bites arn't that great but they do grow on you. Make sure you cut them into small pieces not large bars they hold together that way. Also let them fully cool. Make sure when you put it in the pan you press it firmly down and together not just let it lay loose.",
