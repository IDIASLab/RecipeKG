The only change i made to the recipe was to simply sprinkle all ingredients on top of the bananas then dot with butter rather than creaming them together with the butter. I think next time i make this recipe i will slice the bananas into coins instead of slicing lengthwise to make it easier to serve over top of vanilla ice cream.",

I only had 3 bananas to use so I modified the recipe a bit. I did not cream the butter and sugar. Instead I just drizzled orange juice on the bananas sprinkled with brown sugar dotted the top with butter and sprinkled on a handful of coconut. This was not too sweet... perfect for using up extra bananas. I think using less butter and sugar is better as it just gives the banana flavor a little boost.",

I don't care for cloves so I omitted them but added a dribble of vanilla. I left out the coconut as well simply to suit our tastes.

I decided to try this recipe because it was so very simple. I did as most others did and sprinkled the banans with the ingredients and dotted with butter instead of creaming it together. Also I used freshed squeezed clementine oranged instead of OJ (I used more because fresh squeezed is milder than OJ). I also drizzled the bananas with dark rum (a VERY little). It came out fabulous and would have been even tastier with vanilla icecream or frozen yogurt. Super easy! Will do again for sure.",
