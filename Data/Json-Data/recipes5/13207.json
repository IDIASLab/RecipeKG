You're basically taking a maple syrup-glazed bacon and using it to make a carbonara sauce. Super easy, super quick, and your kids will love it! PS: The most important thing here is your ratio of pasta to bacon to cheese...you can add more or less maple syrup as you see fit! Serve with a side of eggs to very happy children!",
