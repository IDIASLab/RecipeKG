These were kind of a spur of the moment thing so I had to do a few things differently...First I only had a bag of salad shrimp so I also added a package of imitation crab that I chopped up. I sauteed them both w/ the oil and seasonings just to warm them through. I didn't have restaurant style tortillas so I used bite sized round ones. Lastly I didn't have an avocado so I made 'Spicy Cilantro Dressing' from this site to put on top which was perfect for these! I can only imagine how good these are made as written b/c they were great w/ all of my changes. The family really loved these...a definite keeper YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
