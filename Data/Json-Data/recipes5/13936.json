Just too much liquid!\" First I hate to be the first review and it be so disappointing but truth folks I should've used my head and realized all the liquid that both the zucchini and spinach would emit (neither were called for in the instructions to be sweated squeezed nor drained.) The two lonely eggs did nothing but settle around the edges of the quiche's \"guts\" and left a rubbery ring at the crust which incidentally liquified on the base too. My daughter liked what little crusty-crust there was my husband picked out the bacon pieces and ate them reluctantly and I ended up scooping all of the veggies out and using them the following morning in scrambled eggs. With some alterations or vegetable substitutions I'm sure this would be a fine quiche but then the recipe would be an entirely different one altogether. I think I'll stick w/ AR's \"crustless spinach quiche\" but I'm still glad to have tried something new.",
