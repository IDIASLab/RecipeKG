I did take the advice of other reviewers: used orange juice instead of water extended the cooking time until the cranberries burst didn't use the pepper flakes and cut the amount of crystalized ginger in half. I did however add some of the ginger syrup left over from making the crystalized ginger for a bit more kick. At the end of cooking I also added some pomegranate seeds for a nice crunch. This went over so well on Thanksgiving I had to make another batch the next day! Did I mention that it's fantastic over vanilla ice cream? Many many thanks Bea for a new family favorite!",
