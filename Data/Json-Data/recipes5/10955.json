        "description": "Take the stress out of preparing a holiday meal with this flavourful recipe. Herb Apple Dressing pairs beautifully with the sweetness of our Honey & Maple Ham.'If you're looking for a simpler Thanksgiving this year, forego the turkey altogether and give this recipe a try! It has all the herby deliciousness from the sage, parsley, and rosemary plus all the crunchy sweetness from apples and celery. Last but not least, the drippings from the ham get absorbed by the dressing, making it even more decadently delicious.' -Chanelle Saks of @ChezChanelle (creator)",
