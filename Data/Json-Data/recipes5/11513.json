I literally just saw this recipe and it s sorta close to identical to what I made and it was yums! It was a random happenstance that I had smoked turkey sausage on hand that needed to be used and on a whim I tossed in since I had no other proteins in the fridge. I used a mix of hot chili beans with sauce drained/rinsed dark red kidney beans and black beans. I used a mix of rotel and diced tomatoes. No onion (haaate them). Other than that I used beef bouillon and water rather than chicken broth (slightly different but really negligible in a chili). This was a I really don t want to go to the store so what can I toss together recipe that was a huge hit at my house. I also tend to add extra spices/seasonings to literally everything. Very forgiving recipe and we all have our chili variations!",
