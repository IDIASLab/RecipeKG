I chopped the olives and the prunes so the sauce would be a bit more uniform and more flavor would be infused in the sauce. I served with rice, which is why I made so much extra sauce - to soak up into the rice and share the goodness. Don't be afraid to serve this at a dinner party or special event without trying it before (we know we all do it) While you may get a few who snub their noses, I suggest you encourage them to try it before telling them what's in it.",

Don't be scared of the ingrediants...I am NOT a prune fan, but this is the best chicken ever.  I always reserve the sauce it cooks in and serve it in a bowl on the table to dip the chicken in.  To me it is better when you add the brown sugar and the wine to the marinade instead of just sprinkling it over the chicken before it bakes.",

I have seen this recipe around other sites and it was constantly raved about, but I kept avoiding it because I hate olives, never had capers, and never thought of putting prunes in a chicken dish.\r\n\r\nBut I finally took the plunge and made this, only I used 8 boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of whole pieces, and I pureed a whole head of garlic for the marinade, used Kalamata olives, and increased the other ingredients in the marinade as follows:\r\n\r\n1/2 cup olive oil and vinegar\r\n1/2 cup brown sugar\r\n2 small jars capers\r\n1 cup each olives and prunes\r\n4 bay leaves\r\n\r\nThis was so easy to throw together and is perfect for company because all you have to do is throw the chicken into the oven and about 10 minutes before it's done, you can steam some rice or cook some couscous and steam some broccoli or asparagus, allowing you to spend more time with your family or guests.\r\n\r\nThis dish is also great cold as leftovers. Don't let the strange ingredients intimidate you!  It is absolutely delicious in its flavor and you can always push aside the items you don't like.",

I doubled the sauce; the mixture (including brown sugar & wine, but excluding bay leaves) got blended into a chunky puree, and I reserved some for adding at the table. I marinated about 3 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts in the mixture, plus bay leaves, overnight. In the morning, I threw it all in the slow cooker, cooked on low for about 8 hrs, & voila! Tender, delicious, tangy; a perfect Mediterranean dish. Served with couscous and a green salad. Thank you!!",
