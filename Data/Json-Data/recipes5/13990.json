I just put the onion tomato and V8 in my food processor for about 30 seconds and then heated it on the stove for about 5 minutes. Afterwards I realized I should have just dumped it into bowls and put it in the microwave for a minute or two to make it even easier and less mess. I can't get over the fact that I can make FRESH tomato soup in under 5 minutes from start to finish! You could add other ingredients to modify it such as some fresh basil more garlic a little mascarpone cheese would taste great too. It was much better than any canned or prepared tomato soup I have bought from the grocery store and I loved that the consistency was thick just from all the raw vegetables in there. Great recipe!!

I added half of a red bell pepper into the puree blend added some chopped red potatoes and gave also gave it more of an italian flavor with various spices. Since I am also a lemon nut I went ahead and used lemon pepper as well. This is a fabulous recipe with endless possiblities.",

This is a celebration of the simple glorious flavor of burstingly ripe tomatoes period. Very low in calories and naturally fat free. Heart-healthy stuff with a nice dose of lycopene and vitamin C galore! The second time I made this I put in a dab about 1/2 tsp of Minor's chicken base which couldn't be tasted exactly but which lent a nice depth of flavor and salted it just right. Additionally I like to peel and seed the tomatoes before I blend them as I find both to be a detraction. What you taste is exactly what you get uncomplicated and wholesome.",
