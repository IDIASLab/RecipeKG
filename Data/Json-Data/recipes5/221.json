I do not add heavy cream to my version, and we all felt that this made this dish almost decadent!  I did add a little more than the listed 4oz of cheese, because \"cheese\" (!) and used a salt/black pepper/garlic grinder seasoning in place of the garlic salt.  It was tasty, but a little drier than we like.  I'll probably try it again though, as it as definitely comforting and tasty!",
