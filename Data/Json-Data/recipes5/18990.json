I cook the rubbed ham uncovered at 550 for about 20 minutes. I then turn it down to 300 or so (whatever the ham directions call for) and cook it for the length of time called for on the directions. This makes the rub crust nicely and helps seal in the juices. I've used this method with all types of hams and never had dryness issues :)",

                "reviewBody": "I don't want to \"mess with\" the ratings for this particular recipe as is, but I do have some feedback that I think may help others trying this recipe in the future.  I, like many users of allrecipes.com, read a recipe, read some (if not all) of the reviews to get ideas on how to tweak the recipe, and then just go for it!  In this case I was working with not having the pumpkin pie spice or all the ingredients to make my own.  So I took the advice of another reviewer and tried garam masala in place of the pie spice.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and basted the ham with a basic yellow mustard before putting the rub on (in other words \"under\" the rub).  I also followed the additional cooking recommendations that the recipe's author added under the reviews to kind of crisp the outside of the ham and seal in the juices before the low temperature cooking (cook on 550 degrees for first 20 minutes) instead of having to cover the ham.  The results: 1) DON'T ATTEMPT THIS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN OVERHEAD FAN FOR YOUR RANGE (LOL, we are in a rental cottage and quickly discovered how loud the smoke detector is!  I'm glad it works!)  2) With that adventure behind me and the ham finished cooking, I am happy to say that the flavor of the outer/encrusted pieces of ham were FANTASTIC!  We were fighting over who got those pieces!  Thanks for a fun and delicious cooking adventure and good luck to you other adventurers out there!",
