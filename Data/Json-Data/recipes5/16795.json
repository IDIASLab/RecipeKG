The general consensus seemed to be that people loved them for being so different and yummy but there is a lot going on at one time (apricots white chips and almonds).

After reading some of the reviews I tried using a cup of diced almonds but I think if I ever make them again I'll try to reduce it to 3/4 cup.",

As an earlier reviewer mentioned 1 cup of chips is plenty. I also used 1 c diced apricots and 1 c sliced almonds instead of the 3/4 c. called for in the recipe. The cookies were still quite sweet. Be sure your oven is not too hot - if the chips melt they make the cookies spread out and get oily. I had to be vigilant about rotating the sheets around my oven's hot spot. (This happened with Nestle chips - other brands may behave differently). This would be a good cookie for an event where other people are also bringing cookies since it's a bit unusual yet quite easy to make.",

I love apricots so to make these again I'd double them and 1/4 the chips. Or I'd do less sugar and 1/2 the chips along with doubling the apricots as this dough ends up too sweet for my tastes. I even halved the white chips on this first batch--so glad I did. White chips tend to be sweet so it's important to watch the amount you put in. Otherwise though these are easy and basic cookies that are worth another shot. Thanks for the recipe!",

I love almonds so I used small whole ones and toasted them at 350 degrees for about 8 minutes before adding them to the dough. I also read other postings and used only 1 cup of chips. The consistency and dough-to-filling proportions of this recipe weren't to my liking in the first batch so I upped the butter to a full cup added an egg and increased the flour to 2 1/4 cups. this makes more substantial slightly cakier cookies and a whole lot more of them. my cookie-connoiseur friends don't like white chocolate much so next time I will leave out the chips and apricot and use dates for fruit AND sweetness.",
