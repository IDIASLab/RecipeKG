I always use an English cucumber (seedless with 'edible' skin) shred the entire thing in the food processor and then squeeze out the excess liquid for better texture.

My preferences: Garlic Melbas (good for dipping) fresh veggies and tortilla chips.",

I just went to the store and bought 8 more packages of cream cheese because we don't dare run out of this stuff - its addictive! Note: first time I made it I didn't have enough liquid in the pepper sauce so I added water to the jar & hoped it would work. (A taste test off off my finger proved that it didn't - so I added 1/4 tsp of Cajun seasoning salt to the doubled recipe.) Perfect! I liked the little zing from the Cajun flavor so next time I make the dip I will add it again w/ maybe just a touch more. Only suggestion I have is to suggest using very mild flavored crackers or chips as the dip is so good - you don't want to overpower it with a strong flavored cracker.",

I then added a couple of drops of green food coloring. Along with ham or chicken salad and cheese spread it made beautiful ribbon sandwiches. I also had a lot left over which we used as a dip. I would have to say if I used it for sandwiches again I would probably use 1/2 as much mayo. A very good and useful recipe.",

Then, run a knife along the top of each spear to trim away the seeds. * *",
