I did add 2 tablespoons of milk hoping that it could still be spreadable while it was still cold but it didn't happen. Maybe the milk helped soften the dry herbs I didn't have any problems with it. Will definitely make this again. not recommended for parties in which people want to impress others but great for family and such - fantastic for garlic lovers:o)",

I felt the butter \"weighted\" the spread down and added unneeded calories. And the both the amounts of garlic and oregano overpowered the taste of the cream cheese. However this is a 4-star recipe because of its adaptability. I personally omitted the butter and oregano and used powered garlic and onion and bumped up the dill. It turned out very similar to the spread used on the fantastic tomato herbed cream cheese bagels at my local coffee shop. You will enjoy the creativity of this recipe.",
