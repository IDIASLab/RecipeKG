I substituted molasses for the apple juice and used white cane sugar instead of brown. I also left out the coconut powder and ground the flax. I didn't have any gluten so I omitted that as well. Almonds replaced the soy nuts... and were wonderful! These are not too sweet but could use something... maybe something tangy... Thanks for sharing!!!",
