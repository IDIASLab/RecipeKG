My grandmother used to make it, then my mother and her sisters made it for many years. Now that I've moved away from New York and are no longer with them, I make it for my girlfriend's family. Eat it with Thanksgiving dinner, just like we did! Enjoy!",

I put it through my food processor to make it smoother. Crust: I needed a few T more butter for the crust. I added 1/2 c finely chopped pecans to the crust. I wasn't sure it if was supposed to go up the sides but I did get it up the sides about an inch. When the pie was done I added the marshmallows and put the broiler on to very lightly brown the marshmallows then chilled it. I called it sweet potato cheesecake.
