I followed the recipe to a tee the first time and while it was good the amount of lemon juice overpowers everything else in the recipe! I think the lemon juice amount may be a typo. Anyway I made it again and cut the lemon juice to a 1/4 cup increased the roasted garlic to a 1/3 cup and left out the half & half (it didn't really need it to me) and it was to die for. Five stars and highly recommended just go easy on the lemon juice.",

So very close to the actual recipe. It tasted very good but we felt it would be great as a warm/hot dip. So we popped it in the oven at 350 for maybe 20-25 minutes. We ate it with parmesan garlic pita chips. So great!!! Thanks!",
