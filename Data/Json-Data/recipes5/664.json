I had some roasted almonds from the day before so I pan roasted the pecans before adding them to the blender. I added a bit of cinnamon to the crust as well.....so delicious! Followed a review to  beat heavy cream with a bit of pumpkin spice for a topping, that worked out so well! No one thought it was a low sugar desert! Will make this again!",
