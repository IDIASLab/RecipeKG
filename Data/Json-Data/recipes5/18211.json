I made two batches the first batch was alright and the brown sugar wasn't that sticky but they were very very sugary. The second batch I left them in a little bit longer and the sugar stuck together and the potatoes stuck together. It tasted like a ball of sugar going down. I suggest if you are trying to french fry use a deep fryer and through your sweet potatoes in there. My husband and I are Sweet Potatoe lovers and we said we wouldn't do this recipe again. Hope that helps.",
