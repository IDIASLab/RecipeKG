                "reviewBody": "SO good! I'm definitely going to make this again since everyone LOVED it! First off I just sauteed everything in the pressure cooker on SAUTE mode instead of dirtying a separate skillet on the stove. I recommend adding salt to taste in the finished product as it was missing a little something. But once it's all put together in a taco topped with pickled onions cilantro and some queso fresco the flavors just compliment each other so well! I also recommend reserving the water that you soak the chilies in in case you need it. Once in the blender I found the mixture a little thick and thought it might cause issues in the InstantPot so I added a couple tablespoons of the water to give it a slightly thinner consistency. I suspect the meat would be done in much less time but I opted to follow the 60 minutes in the directions. The fat in the meat was perfectly rendered and delicious!",

Delicious!\nThanks for the recipe!",
