I did, however, cover my pork chops/chicken then last 5 minutes I uncovered and broiled per others advice and I could not have had a better recipe! THANKS Kim!",

I added diced onion and then covered the baking dish with foil for the first half hour of cooking.  I then removed the foil, drained the liquid and poured the remainder of the sauce over the chops and cooked uncovered for another 20 minutes.  The result was succulent, tender and very tasty with all the family going back for seconds.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy.  Thank you to the original poster.",

I also added 2 Tbsp of rice wine vinegar, again for a doubled recipe.  I broiled the pork chops, six minutes per side and reduced the marinade to serve as a sauce.  Everyone, kids included, loved this.  The basic dish was a great jumping off place for us!",

The only thing I would do differently next time is perhaps try to let it actualy marinade for the day so that the flavor actually get into the chop.  This time I increased the oven temp to 375 and decreased the cooking time to about 15 mins each side for a boneless chop (1 inch thick) and then let it sit under the broiler for about 3 mins just to get the sauce to \"stick\" this variation seemed to work out just great the sauce didn't slide off as other reviewers mentioned and the pork chop was tender and not at all dry.
