May try more the next time to experiment. I did use the half and half and I roasted 4 huge red peppers and used it all saving some for garnish... To roast the red peppers.....Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Place the whole peppers on a sheet pan and place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes until the skins are completely wrinkled and the peppers are charred turning every 10 minutes during roasting. Remove the pan from the oven and immediately cover it tightly with aluminum foil. Set aside for 30 minutes or until the peppers are cool enough to handle. Remove and discard the stem from each pepper peels and seeds. Chop peppers for recipe. If not using it all Peppers will keep for up to 2 weeks if they are placed in a bowl with any juices that have collected. Pour a couple of Tbsp. olive oil over the peppers. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.",
