There is a wonderful combination of flavor and texture. I especially enjoyed the crunch of the celery and cucumbers. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that for whatever reason the avocado's got lost in the dish and at 1.50 a piece that was a shame. I served this more as a Mexican Cocktail with saltine crackers for dipping instead of in soup form. I will definitely make this again but will cut back on the bell pepper and add another avocado. Try this one out and you will not be disappointed!",

This gazpacho would be great for a summer party. 1/2 recipe was more than enough for my family of five, with plenty leftover, so I reduced the peppers to 1 each. Everything else I halved. Use barely ripe avocados, because you don't want them to be mushy. The gazpacho had just enough spicy heat to compliment the vegetable flavors. My husband raved about the taste, and he had to bring the leftovers to work almost every day after we had it!",
