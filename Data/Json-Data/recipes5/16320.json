I also cut the chorizo links into little cubes instead of frying it loose. My husband really enjoyed it to. My only complaint was that I think you could use a little less extra virgin olive oil. There was oil left on our plates at the end of the meal. But a VERY fast and wonderful taste experience!!!",
