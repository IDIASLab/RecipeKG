If looking for rice like one would get at a Mexican restaurant this is pretty close. My only problem was it was a tad dry. I ended up adding about tsp. of vegetable oil at the end which helped. I didn't have V8 so I found a subtitute to do 1/2 tomato sauce and 1/2 water and it tasted very similar. I made broth from broth paste so I could control the sodium. I made 1/2 recipe and it made about 4 servings. At the end I added some frozen defrosted peas and carrots for color and texture. ty",
