The recipe makes alot of marinade for 12 wings so I doubled the amount of wings. Lastly I baked mine at 375 for 20-25 mins without basting. Turned on the broiler to crisp it up for a few mins and perfection!",

I used it on pieces of chicken breast instead of wings, and I couldn't go out to grill so I baked them in the oven in the marinade (@ 375 for about 25 minutes). I've never cooked with habaneros before, so I didn't know how hot this was going to be, but it was a perfect level of spiciness for me - a good moderate amount of heat. I will definitely keep making this. Thanks, BencyCooks!",

We also baked them in the oven due to the extreme temperatures in WI this time of year. I thought the wings would be dry in the oven but the marinade bakes off and they were perfected moist with a slightly crisp skin. The sauce left in the pan went WONDERFULLY with the cilantro lime rice from this website. To get more of a kick i may add a little more jalepeno next time (i must admit that we only used 2 jalepeno peppers without the seeds due to us have small kids around). Overall very tasty.",
