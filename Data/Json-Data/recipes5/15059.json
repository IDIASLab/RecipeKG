The only variation I used was freshly ground sea salt/freshly ground pepper blend, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to taste. In addition, I used flavored breads crumbs as opposed to the plain bread crumbs.  I used about a pound of scallops instead of the 16 as recommended in the recipe The dish was prepared and cooked in a 9 x 13 pyrex dish sprayed with a non-stick cooking spray.",

But instead of putting all of the topping on top of the scallops, I put a little dab on each scallop and scattered the rest of the topping around the scallops, allowing the topping to \"soak up\" the melted butter/garlic mix that I did not discard, but poured over and around scallops in the casserole dish - this came out crispy and delicious!  And easy??  This is the first time I've ever cooked scallops (was always afraid to) and this recipe made me a whiz at it!  Will be making this again!!",
