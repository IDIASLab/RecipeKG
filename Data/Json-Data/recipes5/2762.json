I did not experience any problems previously mentioned; crumbly messy wouldn't release. I found it to be perfect. I did let it rest longer than an hour before I inverted it and used a rubber spatula to help release the sides. (remember the sides of a cake/bundt pan should be room temp. before inverting)I poured the glaze over the cake while it was still inside the mold just take your time and let it absorb a bit. The prep work is very similar to a Rum Cake so you may even want to pierce holes in the cake for the icing so seep through. Good Luck!!!",

A cooking tip that my sister taught me is to buy a product called Bakers Joy. It is in the baking section of your local grocery store. It is in a can and is oil and flour combined. You just spray your bundt pan with it. Works perfect every time. I only waited about 15 minutes to flip the cake out of the bundt pan and it turned out perfect. (See photo) Thanks Heather",

An angel food pan would be easier but not as pretty. When inverting it about 1/3 of my cake stuck and I had to scrap it out and stick it together. When I tried to center the cake it wouldn't budge. I used fresh lemon juice for the glaze which is good but the cake is extremely moist and super super sweet. I may try to make this again b/c I really love lemon cake. The glaze causes the cake to stick when inverting so be careful. Perhaps making less of the glaze and pouring it over once the cake has been inverted would be a good solution.",
