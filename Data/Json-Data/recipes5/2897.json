Also I'm not a fan of olives so I omitted them and added a bit more roasted red pepper and feta which took away a bit of the color-contrast you want in a salad but tasted just fine. I hope it doesn't dry out overnight as I made it with the intention of having it for lunch tomorrow but I don't see why the addition of a little olive oil couldn't remedy that problem.",
