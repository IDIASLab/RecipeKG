I prepared the lemon/mint mixture in advance and had the water ready to boil so it was easy to whip it up while the meat rested. One person suggested there was a bit too much mint but that could have been due to the time the lemon/mint mixture spent sitting before I cooked the asparagus (It was probably sitting 4 hours or so). The feta added to it as well! Next time might be tasty with some black pepper added as well. Overall great recipe!",
