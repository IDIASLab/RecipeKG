Watch out for MY mistakes- I didn't use small enough potatoes, you have to really go for the baby size to cook perfectly in the time stated and be sure you are using a medium high heat on your stove so you won't have burning (or, even worse, no crunch).  I mixed my spices together and then sprinkled them evenly over the potatoes, which I think worked far better for evening out the taste, and I added a little more oil plus some Cajun seasoning  on my second preparation.  This was strictly to my taste, the recipe truly is perfect.",
