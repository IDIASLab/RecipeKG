For anyone worried about or having trouble with pesto falling off or burning on their steaks I marinated my steaks in about 2T pesto (don't worry you'll have plenty for topping) loosened with a splash of lemon and olive oil. You can shake the excess off - or not I didn't - when you're ready to grill. Awesome. Thanks for the recipe!!!",

The garlic rubbed on the meat didn't do much good; it burned off while the meat was cooking but that's a small quibble. My husband and I loved this. I served it with sliced tomatoes and roasted cauliflower. Thanks for the recipe desi!",
