This recipe really delivers and being a bar cookie saved me lots of time and effort in making individual rolled cookies. I had a difficult time handling the lattice crust on top however. My strips kept falling apart. But overall this was an awesome treat.",

I mixed 1 1/2 Tbsp milk into the egg white for the glaze mixing it with a fork; this makes it easier to brush on with a pastry brush while still giving a nice glaze to the dough. Using turbinado sugar for sprinkling on the dough (under glaze ingredients) bakes up well and adds a nice texture. Baking time was longer than suggested- about 23-25 minutes at 350 degrees.",
