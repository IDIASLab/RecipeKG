I halved the recipe and baked it the full time. It was very good. I found the bread to be a little too soggy; I possibly could have baked it a little longer to take care of that although the topping was really perfect. Cooking any more would have changed that. At any rate the dish has a lot of good flavors the subtle orange and ginger flavors really adding to it. It is sweet and could certainly be served with whipped cream or ice cream as a dessert. In fact when my husband tasted his he said \"This could be a dessert.\" I am definitely going to make this for the dinner party and will make it many more times in the future.",
