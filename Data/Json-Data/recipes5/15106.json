Although I did do a few things differently (I used half and half rather than heavy cream, used a bag of frozen corn rather than ears, used boneless skinless chicken breasts, added 3 tablespoons of butter to the sweet potato mix, and I put about a teaspoon of salt into the marinade,) I think next time I make it I will add more chili powder, more hot sauce, and maybe some cayenne powder into the marinade.  I also think I would put a dash of chili powder on top of the corn along with the salt and pepper, and might try experimenting with a dash or so of cinnamon in the sweet potato mix.  With these changes, this recipe is certainly deserving of 5 stars!\n\nAfter I've written all of that I'm craving this meal again.",

I used 1 tablespoon because it didn't specify. Instead of grilling I did roast my chicken in the oven and it was great. After tasting the sweet potatoes I added 2 TB of butter and that made them perfect. My husband has already requested for me to make it again. Next time I think I will make it with boneless skinless chicken breast though.",

I also put the marinade ingredients into a Ziploc bag, mixed it by squeezing, then added the chicken instead of mixing the marinade in a bowl.  Less mess that way.  I used cream but milk would work fine.  You can mix corn into the yams or not.  Either way would be fine.  I used skinless boneless filets.  They cooked faster and were still yummy.  Grilling bone-in chicken without burning it requires about an hour of constant attention.  My way was easier.  This recipe is worth keeping for the marinade alone.  This marinade is going into my regular rotation.  Marinade Tip:  Poke skinless chicken several times with a fork to allow it to soak up marinade better.  2 hrs soaking is enough.  All day soaking is fine but it's no better than 2 hrs.",
