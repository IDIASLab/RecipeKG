One recommendation...we went for the Grand biscuits, but they tend to be a little denser and larger than, say a Pillsbury flaky biscuit.  As a result, the middle of the casserole was not thoroughly cooked.  Some loved the doughy texture--but I'm a perfectionist.  It will be on the table next Easter morning (if not sooner)!",
