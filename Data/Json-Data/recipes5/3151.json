I use a small can of crab meat and defrosted salad shrimp (squeeze all the water out of them) instead of all shrimp. I also have substituted low fat cream cheese lite mayo and low sodium cream of mushroom soup to make the dish a bit lighter. I present it in a crab shaped mold over a bed of lettuce greens. Still tastes yummy. Great because it is made ahead of time. My kids loved to dive into the leftovers when they were younger (if there were any). Serves a large crowd.",
