I whisked the yogurt and egg really good to get as much air as I could into it. Folded the dry mix in very carefully. I was surprised to see how beautifully fluffy the batter was.. Like pillows. I cooked mine in a bit of coconut oil. You do need to make sure to spread them out a bit.. To ensure they cook properly. I got 5 nice sized ones. You can easily use flavored Greek yogurt that would add some sweetness and you could really change it up. I love the tanginess plain Greek yogurt brings to these pancakes. I served mine with a dollop of Greek yogurt a drizzle of maple syrup and fresh berries. Thanks!.. Will be making these all the time:)",
