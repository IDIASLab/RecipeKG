Its blend of lamb, spices, almonds and currants (raisins) give it a mellow, sweet, crunchy and heady flavor. This is all offset by the juiciness of the cabbage roll, braised slowly in a hint of tomato puree and silky chicken broth. It was a breeze to make, using Chef John's tips for steaming the cabbage to remove the leaves, plus his directions for shaping the meat into tiny loaves before stuffing and rolling the cabbage like a burrito. This recipe was unlike any other recipe on this site for stuffed cabbage and it was a joy!",

Second I had some Campbell's tomato juice cans and it worked out fine. Third I added in a dew additional spices I thought would go well into the mix ( personal preference ). Finally the review that suggested the microwave for the cabbage leaves was awesome. Put the cabbage in a small casserole and added enough water to cover the bottom with about a quarter inch of water. Scored and stabbed into the core of the cabbage. 2 minutes at a time and the leaves came of intact. I didn't burn off my fingers as happens when I boil the cabbage and water gets trapped between the leaves. Nothing like unexpected scalding to put you off enjoying dinner. Finally used the cooking liquid to create a thicker sauce to drizzle.",
