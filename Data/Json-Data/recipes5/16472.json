If you don't have sour milk add one tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to the milk and let it stand 5 minutes before using. I followed this recipe exactly except I sprinkled the cookies very lightly with powdered sugar while they were still warm. That made these pretty cinnamon-colored cookies look even more appealing. Thanks Carol for such a great recipe.",
