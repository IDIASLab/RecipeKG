I only needed about a jar and a half. If you can't find ground lamb meat ask your butcher to grind up a lamb roast for you or plan in advance and call some stores to see if they can order you the ground lamb. The lamb taste is essential! Look for the grape leaves in the olive aisle...they actually had them at the Safeway even though I was prepared to go to an ethnic food store for them. I will be sharing this recipe and making the dish again and again!",

Also instead of covering with water I cover them with a simple tomato sauce I make (chopped tomatoes drop of olive oil tsp tomato paste little bit of water and salt are heated till tomatoes soft. when its cooled I just blits it in a blender/food processor. The tomatoes and onions give it a richer taste.",

I was pleased with these and though I followed the recipe exactly I plan to make a couple minor adjustments next time. I'm going to halve the pepper and increase the allspice by a half-teaspoon. Instead of soaking the rice Grandma always mixed about 1/2 cup of water into the meat mixture with the dry rice. It gave some moisture for the rice to absorb without extra prep or an overly tough middle. (She preferred her lamb ground coarsely for most flavor. Short-grain rice is also the traditional rice for stuffing grape leaves.) One more TIP is to use a smaller amount of filling so that the raw amount is about the size of a short stubby pencil. The finished leaves will be the size of a child's marker. In this way they will be a lovely shape and you will use most of your jarred leaves. Finally she never added garlic but I LOVED it in these! And next time I will remember to add the olives! I served with extra lemon plain yogurt and pita bread and thought I was back in time:)",
