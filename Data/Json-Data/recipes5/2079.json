Really slaved trying to pipe these in - the filling didn't spread right and I'd get a corner with a ton of filling. To make the same amount of filling in each one and have it spread throughout I just opened each puff in half and spread it with an offset spatula. No bites without mousse!  These are unbelievably easy and the hubby loved them.",

I have made a few different flavors now and all are great! We like them really full so I use the larger box of pudding and full tub of cool whip. For easy piping with a ziploc bag cut the zipper off, put the bag corner down into a large cup to fill it, cut the tip off and squeeze it in. These will be made often!! Thanks",
