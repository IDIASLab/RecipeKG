I couldn't stop with just one serving. In addition the mold holds up well while at the same time melting in your mouth. I found using canned fruit cocktail made it easier to eat as the pieces of fruit were not too large for eating. It was a hit with the crowd as well. A nice sweet dessert but not so rich like cheesecake.",
