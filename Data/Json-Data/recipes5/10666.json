This chicken Marsala dish was the most popular dish on the menu and the first one that I was taught.",

I soak my chicken breasts beforehand in milk and marsala, about 1/2 cup wine  to 1 1/2 cups milk for 20 min. Then pat dry and I always use flour in a zip lock bag (the gallon sz) when pounding/flattening my chicken so it does not stick or fall apart. Then I use a couple of beaten eggs laced with a little more marsala before I dip into my flour seasoned flour mixture.  My chicken comes out so tender and juicy that you literally do not need a knife ever when eating my chicken.",

When you reduce it the taste gets richer and more delicious.  If you use less liquid as some reviews have said you will get something ho hum.  You really need to reduce it quite aggressively at each stage.  \n\nI used boneless skinless chicken breasts dredged in flour with some salt pepper and oregano.  Browned and set aside then after adding the marsala wine to the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and shallots really reduce it until it is quite thick.  Add the stock in the proportions suggested and reduce it until it is almost the consistency you want but still a bit runny.  Then I added the breasts and cooked 5 min per side.  After taking the fully cooked chicken out I further reduced the sauce until it was at the thickness I wanted.  Watch carefully it can reduce fast and burn if you are not careful.  So then the sauce is rich and full bodied, absolutely delicious.  I added the butter at the end as John suggested and wow.  Awesome.",
