I also peel the beans: they have a thin covering that does not process as well as the core. You will find a MUCH creamier consistency. Roll them gently in a towel or between your palms then just pick off the coating. It is surprising what a difference it makes it's not \"labor intensive\" but it does take a while making a quick recipe not so quick",

Of course I made a few changes... no tahini so I added extra olive oil. Less than half the cayenne and it's still got some kick... but that might have to do with the fresh jalapeno I used (you never know how hot they are until they're mixed in!). I also used the juice of a fresh lime instead of lemon. And I didn't even let it sit... just eating it straight out of the mixer!! It's delicious:-) Thanks for the recipe!!",
