When compared to other granola recipes, this has quite a bit less sweetener--which really allows the nuts, seeds, oats, and dried fruit flavors to come through instead of being hidden behind sugary additives. So if you're looking for a sweeter, from-the-grocery-store kind of granola, just know that's not what you're getting here. What you ARE getting is a delicious, nutritious, and very very easy-to-make granola that's worlds better than store-bought. I swapped walnuts for the pecans, added a touch of cinnamon, and added some maple extract to really bring out that flavor more. I would absolutely recommend it! Thank you so much for the recipe!!",
