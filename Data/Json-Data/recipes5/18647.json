The guava paste has a more concentrated flavor than the fruit, so be careful how much you add.  I did it to taste, but also be aware that guava paste is a bit grainy (but that didn't bother me).  I just chopped up up the guava paste into small cubes and heated it up according to instructions, then transferred to the blender and gave it a quick whirl, then poured back in the pot and added the rest of the ingredients and followed the directions.  It was AMAZING.",
