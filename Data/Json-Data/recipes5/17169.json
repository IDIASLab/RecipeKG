Skip the cloves, add another teaspoon of cinnamon. 3. Add a 1/2-3/4 teaspoon of baking soda so that the cookies rise a bit, they don't in the original recipe.  4.  Switch half of the white flour w/ whole wheat flour, it tastes the same and is much healthier. 5.  Use white choc. chips!--huge difference, goes much better w/ banana taste. These changes make the cookies superb, and your friends won't stop asking for more!",

EDIT: January 29, 2009  I've been making these for a few years now and they are always awesome. I add a bit more banana and vanilla and some nutmeg and extra cinnamon- I like a lot of spice in my cookies. I have also used butter and margarine or a mix because of the whole trans fat thing. (No more margarine for me!) I have also added milk chocolate chips to half of the cookies for my hubby. Still a keeper after all these years! :)",

This is not short on flavor, as the oatmeal, banana and nutty flavors are all prominent. It has a rustic, whole grain texture, not cakey at all, just that of a chewy oatmeal cookie. There is nothing wrong with the recipe, but it will never make a chocolate chip cookie move over.  ",

I used four bananas (not one), margarine instead of shortening, extra cinnamon, no cloves and some chocolate chips but otherwise kept the quantities of the ingredients unchanged.  The result was a very moist and tasty cake-like cookie, which was particularly good fresh from the oven.  I was surprised at how many cookies it made.

After doing so I realized I should have perhaps added more moisture to take the place of the wetness of the fruit but actually these turned out great. I made them three ways 1)rolled in balls - they formed puffy domes all nice and soft 2)rolled in balls and flattened slightly - nice thick even cookies that were crispy on the outside soft on the inside 3)spooned out and flattened pretty well - crisp crunchies. My family loved the three kinds from just one batch. Good stuff!",

I made them plain and with the above additions and the raisin-coconut addition made them soooo much better. I like the plain ones too, but my boyfriend only likes the ones with the extras. (I didn't have walnuts so neither of the batches had them). I should mention that I tried to make these a bit healthier by using only 1/2 cup of shortening and adding extra banana to increase moistness...I used 1 cup banana and it worked great. Also, I didn't have cloves on hand so I used pumpkin pie spice like someone suggested and it worked well. In the end, these are a nice change from banana bread, but I think I still prefer to use my extra bananas for banana bread.",

I also only used about 1/8 tsp cloves as I did not want to over-power the banana flavor.  These turned out WAY better than I expected and I found it hard to stop eating the uncooked dough!
