This may not be as good as my favorite Greek restaurant's gyro, but it's as good (or better) than most gyros that you find at restaurants.  I served with a tzatziki sauce from this site, as well.  I was amazed at how easy this was to make.  Definitely will be making again.  Thanks ltsutton for sharing your recipe!",

I serve it with red onion, feta, tomato, cucumber and dill dressing on warm flat bread.  I can almost smell the Mediterranean sea...mmmmmm",
