I don't like to make any changes, but sometimes it gets a bit pricey to buy new ingredients you have never used before. I have never heard of the item vermouth. I looked up on the internet to see what it was and what would be a possibly good substitute for it.  I used Sherry instead. I also used only half of what the recipe recommended for lemon juice since it looked like a lot when I was squeezing it into the skillet. I halved the recipe since I was just cooking for myself. Overall, the dish was very tasty and I would definitely make it again. It's a great dish! Also there is no photo?! I uploaded one of mine. :)",

What you used would be great also but a very different flavor. Also to all the citics I see hear NEVER us COOKING sherry read the label it has a lot of other stuff including salt. When it aclls for Sherry use that it is a clean taste. Also for the fresh herb bigots they do have a good flavor but should be put in at the end as they don't stand up to long cooking like dried herbs. Pick and choose for what you are making",

Overall a very tasty and healthy dish that I ll make again!",
