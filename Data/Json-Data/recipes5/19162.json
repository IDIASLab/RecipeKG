In fact, traditional marranitos get their delicious spicy-brown goodness from molasses. This recipe is a trans-pecos region variation, it uses the non-traditional addition of cinnamon. You may wish to try also adding a bit of dry ground ginger, and you may use a milk wash instead of an egg wash.",

The second time I made them I altered the recipe just a bit, which really made them incredible:  1)I added 1 tsp of ground ginger as suggested.  2)I thought these were a tad too molasses-y, so I used 3/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup honey.  3)To make the dough a little less crumbly and easier to roll out, I upped the milk to 1/3 cup.  4) I like them to be a little thicker, so I rolled the dough out to 1/2 inch thickness.  Also, my pig cookie cutter was much smaller than the traditional, so this recipe made 4 dozen cookies, and I baked them for 12 minutes (you don't want to overbake).  Delicious!  ",

My one suggestion is to adjust the baking time if you dont have the marranito/puerquito cookie cutter. this cookie cutter is slightly larger then your average large cookie. I used a large tulip cookie cutter (b/c its what i had) and the first batch hardened to much, and they were okay, but they defintely didnt have that authentic marranito texture. So I lowered the timed by 3-4 mintues. Its also important to roll the batter into the right thickness...enjoy!",
