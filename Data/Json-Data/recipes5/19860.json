There are also different options for type of meat to use, like ground chuck or ground turkey (do not use ground beef). If using ground turkey, you'll have to coat your skillet with a little olive or veggie oil before cooking as it has very little fat and will stick to skillet.",

As for this recipe my husband is in love with it! I only had a pound of pork so I went ahead put all the spices called for in the recipe in a spice grinder to blend them evenly, makes about 7 tablespoons, put a third of that into the pound of pork, cooked it off and used in Lasagna Rollotini. Soooo good, even if I would let my husband go back to commercial sausage he wouldn't in a million years. Thanks so much for the recipe.",

I used kosher salt and 1 1/2 t of red pepper flakes. And I completely forgot the brown sugar didn't seem to affect it at all. And to test it out I used the first pound in one of our family favorite recipe. Passed the test:) Thank you for this recipe.",

I added a little more of each spice and a wise old Italian once told me to use 1 TBSP of salt per pound of pork. For 4 lbs I used 3 TBSP of kosher salt. This is the 2nd time I have made this and it was perfect. I also use 1TBSP of red wine vinegar per pound so I did use 4 TBSP for what I had. I also added fresh garlic, about 2 TBSP. \n\nThe key to making sausage is keeping it cold. Cut shoulder into strips to feed into grinder. After you cut them stick them in a bowl and into the freezer for 30-45 minutes. Grind the sausage after that and once ground put back in a bowl for 30 minutes in the freezer without spices. Take out and flatten like a hamburger, cover the top with all of the spices and fold in. If you use the same bowl you used in the freezer the bowl will still be cold and you grind it again with the spices back into the bowl. Grinding again with the spices breaks it down a little more and blends the spices perfectly.",

Because that has a sweetness to it I didn't add the little bit of brn sugar. I scaled the crushed red pepper back a bit and used a full tsp of oregano and thyme. I mixed all this and then froze it to use for lasagna another time. Today after I cooked it up and tasted it; I was bummed that it was so salty (and I like salty food). I'll make it again but add only 1/2 salt called for. Then this will be 5 stars I'm sure. I'm hoping all the other ingredients in my lasagna mellow it out...guess I'll find out soon as I'm cooking it for dinner tonight. Update: I added sausage to 1/2 of my lasagna and did notice how salty that side tasted. But...the next day after re-heating...it was fine (strange). Anyway I'll still go w/half the salt next time. If it could use more after cooking I can add it; sure can't take it out though.",

I used the auto adjust button to reduce the recipe to 4 serving sizes to accommodate the 1 lb of pork I had to use and those ingredients translated down to just a pinch each not enough to make a difference in the recipe whether for the original serving size or not.",
