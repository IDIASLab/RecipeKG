I also spread them out so they would individually brown nicely.  Perfect!  I will make this again and again!  Tastes like popcorn vegetables!  (but better than popcorn)\nUpdate: I've lost count how many times I've made this.  I should add that I don't thaw the edamame, but I just mix the ingredients together with the frozen edamame and place them directly into the oven.  That might be why they always turn nice and crispy for me!\nUPDATE:  I've lost count how many times I've made this recipe!  I ran out of parchment last night and I decided to add them to a pan coated with Pam.  BIG MISTAKE!  They turned out soggy, sticky and gross!!!  DO NOT baked this on tin foil or directly on the pan.  What a mess!  This probably explains some low ratings on this dish.  ONLY USE A PAN LINED WITH PARCHMENT PAPER:)",

I do think it is easier to mix the oil, garlic, and cheese in a large bowl then add the edamame, put a lid or plastic wrap on it and shake it up.  It coats everything better and the cheese doesn't all end up stuck to the baking pan instead of the edamame.  This is also good with fresh green beans, peppers, and/or onion slices.",

After the edamame are thawed I would highly recommend putting them on a towel and patting them dry. When wet they cannot crisp. I had to keep them in the oven for a longer time. I also do not recommend using freshly grated parmesan cheese or increasing the amount then. The edamame did not get coated like in the photo. These changes will greatly help the recipe.",

First bite into them they immediately reminded me of these french fries I used to order at a certain restaurant with that perfect balance of crispness and chewiness. I only made a half recipe first time around patted them dry after thawing used garlic salt fresh cracked pepper from a pepper mill and rest of ingredients on list. I had to bake mine for around 22-24 minutes instead to get them to crisp up but thats what made them have the perfect texture. Will definitely be making these again!",

First off I have never cooked with nor eaten edamame so I wasn't sure what to expect. I bought mine a couple weeks ago but they were in the shell so I had to shell them (total pain in the rear buy the already shelled) and were lightly salted which I didn't notice till the last min but thank goodness I did. I cooked them from frozen ( I sprayed the pan with cooking spray and had no problems) with the other ingredients  as directed but left out any salt until I could taste them cooked. I did toss em around on the pan while cooking so the browning would be a little more even. Seems that alotta folks had problems getting them crispy so after they browned I turned the oven off and let it cool for about 10 mins then put the baking sheet back in and let them dry for about 15 more mins ( I did toss em around a few times to make sure they wouldn't get any browner) then let em cool off. Mine turned out crispy and man alive were they a nice munchie snack! BF opted for these over popcorn for a movie. SCORE plus it reminded me to not be afraid of the \"unknown\" food!",
