I've had it for lunch five days in a row with half of a tomato sandwich and I can't get enough.

I am not sure if 275 at 30 min is a typo or not, but that time/temp combo does not produce soft, browned cauliflower.  I added an extra 10 min at 425 to the end of that cooking time.  Next time I will do 20-25 min at 400.  The other major change was that I added 3 strips of bacon (fried and crumbled) to the soup.  Great! Minor changes included leaving out the flour (to eliminate carbs and because it really wasn't needed) and partially pureeing the soup with an immersion blender so it was thick and creamy with small cauliflower chunks.  I also did not have chervil and used parsley instead. This is delicious soup and really resembles loaded baked potato soup when you top it with bacon crumbles and cheese.",

Skipped the flour and heavy cream altogether. Instead I found a cream of onion soup in the cabinet to add to the chick stock. No spices used except for S&P.
