He doesn't usually react this strongly to restaurant indian food so this was unusual. But my son and I loved it! If I ever do it again I may do less of the spices as 2 tablespoons of ANY spice is a lot. This recipe uses around 5 tablespoons of spices which is a lot for most curries that I have made. I think you could half the spice and it would be almost as good and your husband's tummy won't go crazy!",

It has a bit of Indian character because of the spices but lacks the heat which is characteristic of Indian curries.  I added Chinese chilli sauce which made it hotter.  \n\nThis would be fine for someone who wants a hint of Indian character but would find an authentic Indian recipe too spicy or too hot.",

First I doubled the cayenne pepper amount based on previous reviewers' comments that it was a bit mild. Second to save money on lamb (and to cut down on the calories) I used 1.25 lbs of lamb and supplemented the rest of the dish with 1 cup of chopped carrots (added when I added the onions) 1 lb. of cauliflower (added in the last 20 minutes when I removed the lid from the Dutch oven) and 1 cup of frozen peas (added in the last two minutes of cooking). I will definitely make this again. We devoured it. Next time I might try the slow-cooker approach. Thanks for posting!!",
