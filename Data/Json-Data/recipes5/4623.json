I added more ingredients then slow cooked it for a bit longer. Was a big hit with my Filipino friends. Bear in mind, the different types of vegetables can be lessened, increased, or omitted, based on preference. Serve over white rice.",

So we added an extra TBSP of soy sauce and a little sea salt. Served over Jasmine rice with added toasted almonds and a side medley of stir-fried veggies. Will be making this one again.
