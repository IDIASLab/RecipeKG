For the onions, cut them from one root end to the others and then slice them in little strips between the roots.  They will be  narrower on the ends and this keeps them from disintegrating during the caramelizing and cooking process.",

A few suggestions as we modified by 1) making the quick hummus 2) cutting recipe in half and 3) placing on pizza dough. About 2/3 of the hummus/pumpkin mixture suggested is actually needed (2/3 of 16 oz container of hummus and 1/3 can of pumpkin will do the trick). I added chopped fresh sage. Less fontina cheese is needed as this is an extremely soft melty cheese. To avoid soupy texture I'd suggest 2 c. max if you half the recipe or are making one 10\" pizza. Caramelizing onions in olive oil almost never works right as olive oil gets to a higher temperature faster than butter. I'd recommend subbing out butter instead. Comes out better and takes much less time. Hope this helps!",
