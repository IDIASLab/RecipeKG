I'd never made one because I never thought I'd be able to make one as good as the one you can find at the store but I was waaaay wrong. This chicken was hands down the most delicious and moist chicken we've ever had. My husband is still raving about how good it was two hours after having eaten it. I cannot wait to chop up the leftovers for super awesome salad for lunch. This is a phenomenal recipe! Thank you so much!!",
