I halved the recipe because of the mixed reviews but there was nothing wrong with this recipe at all.  I didn't find it any sweeter than french toast with syrup.  I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the carmel sauce after it cooked and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the egg mixture. Other than that, I didn't change anything and I ended up eating all four pieces myself ( I even ate one cold and it was GREAT!!!) If your brown sugar turns hard, if you add boiling water it will eventually disolve into a delicious carmel sauce.  Be patient and keep stirring...it's worth it!",

I've never actually made caramel before so I just followd the directions exactly... After I was done making the bread I put the brown sugar in the pan over a medium heat. It took quite a while to start melting and before it reached the consistency I was waiting for it began to smell like it was burning. When it was nearly all melted I added the water (which was room temperature). The sugar instantly hardenend (makes sense). Obviously there was no way to dip anything in this rock hard sheet of sugar that was floating in water so I waited and stirred. Pretty quickly it began boiling and the sugar was slowly melting back into the water. By now it definitely smelled funny. I thought maybe that's the way it's supposed to smell (remember I've never made caramel before). I continued cooking it until the sugar was basically all melted/combined with the water. Then I dipped a piece of french toast in it and tasted it; It tasted funny too. In the end we had french toast the old fashioned way last night with syrup. I think I should have read the reviews first but regardless seems like a lot of extra work for something that (aside from the burned taste) was not that great a substitute for good old-fashioned syrup.",

When it starts to melt ( in about a minute over medium heat, no higher) SLOWLY add the boiling water to the pan a little bit at a time.  You can even try to add small amt of extra butter to thicken it a little.  i ended up not using all of the water and just added what I needed to get it to the consistency I wanted.  When all of the sugar is melted, you can gently boil it for another minute.  The key is to keep the flame no higher than medium and stir constantly.",
