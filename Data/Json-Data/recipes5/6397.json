To save on washing pots, steaming it, I just put the ingredients in a small covered bowl with a tsp or two of water and microwaved it for the 5 minutes. This only makes one large or 2 small servings. Since that was the case, I halved the lemon juice and seasoning salt amounts. I thought the end result was it was a little tart and salty. I definitely want to try this again and next time do 1/4 of the lemon juice and seasoning salt. It was a nice change to the typical garlic, olive oil, and lemon flavorings on many side dishes.",

Oh my did we pucker our lips from the lemon, and lunge for our drinks from the salt. A great concept, easy and colorful, just needed half the lemon, half the seasoned salt.",
