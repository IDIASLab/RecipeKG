Sauteed 1/2 a large onion added 1 can Hot Rotell tomatoes 1 can of black beans 1 can of sweet corn 1 can V8 (from other reviewers suggestion) 1 diced red bell pepper few shakes of hot sauce and 1 TBS taco seasoning. I let that all simmer for 45 mins (only intended for 30 min but hubby ran late) Added 1 more can of V8 put the uncooked ramen noodles directly into the pot simmered 10 minutes. Put a couple scoops taco beef in a bowl with noodle mixture on top for hubby. I'm a vegetarian so left the beef out of my bowl. Topped both with shredded cheddar and then I added a dollop of sour cream and diced 1/2 an avacado on top of my bowl. Sure it took more time and effort than the original recipe- but was outstanding! We like spice and the habanero in the rotell gave it serious kick adding the sour cream and avacado cut it down but still not kid friendly. Thanks so much for your original recipe!!! I would have never added these ingredients together without your adventurous start!",
