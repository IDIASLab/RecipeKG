Like some of the other reviews I added some garlic for a little extra flavor. I have a similar potato recipe without eggs that has cream cheese and sour cream. As a matter of personal taste I'll probably stick with that one in the future but this one has the potential to be a big hit if you like a really fluffy texture. The french fried onions on top are a nice extra that I will try out the next time I make my usual recipe. Thanks for sharing it!",
