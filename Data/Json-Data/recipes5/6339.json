I took the information from all the recipes and meshed them together, deleting some ingredients and adding others. The dish turned out wonderful. This is a side dish that I have served with quite a few different types of main dishes. It seems to go with almost any type of food.",

I know the mint is traditional for this specific recipe but I didn't love that part. I'd probably use a different herb next time but that is just me. This turned out far better than I had anticipated and is one I'd definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!",

I think perhaps the directions are missing a step to rinse off all the salt from the cucumbers. It just said to drain off the water so that s what I did but 2 tablespoons of salt soaked into the cucumbers made it inedible. It was way too salty. I will try this recipe again and rinse all the salt off. Perhaps I m missing something?",
