I assume it should be slightly beaten, then added at the same time as the other wet ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is that the batter was VERY runny.  2 Tablespoons of vanilla seems like an awful lot.  Perhaps this should have been 2 teaspoons?  I've never seen a recipe that called for that much vanilla, so I'm guessing that's the source of the too-runny batter.\r\n\r\nThe pancakes did taste good.  I'll probably make them again, but use much less vanilla, and perhaps add the milk gradually to achieve proper consistency.",

When I stirred everything up, I was a bit leary, as the batter was very thin.  I let it sit for a few minutes for the w.w. to absorb more of the liquid.  It still was very thin but went ahead and they puffed up beautifully.  No sticking even with omitting the oil.  I couldn't really taste the sugar but perhaps because it was a bit heavy on the salt side; would perhaps cut salt in half.  I was brave and used 1 tbsp. of vanilla and it gave it a very nice flavor without being overwhelming.  Buttermilk could easily replace the reg. milk if one wishes.  Thanks for the quick and hearty breakfast recipe!",

I omitted the oil altogther used 1/4 C egg substitute to lighten things up and believe it or not I do think this requires the full 2 T of vanilla (which I thought was crazy at first but I started with 2 t and after tasting the batter I decided it needed a lot more...) and these turned out perfectly!",
