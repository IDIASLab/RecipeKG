This soup was a bit thinner the egg flavor was less strong and the lemon was more of a sour flavor - as opposed to a bright flavor (holla if you hear me!). I like a strong chicken flavor but did not want to mess with all the skimming so I used 2 lbs split bone-in chicken breast and replaced the water with chicken stock. Hubby hates veggies so I removed them as the recipe suggests but if I had my druthers I'd chop them up leave them in and reduce the amount of chicken. PS... be sure to FOLD the yolks into the egg whites (rather than beat in the mixer) or it will be frothy. Despite the differences the whole family enjoyed the soup.",
