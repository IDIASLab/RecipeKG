After reading through the ingredient amounts and the previous reviews I figured that the amount of stuffing was going to be a little off. I used 2 artichokes but only cut the stuffing down by 1/3 and had just enough. If you're going to make the whole ten artichokes you should probably at least triple everything else. Really really tasty and different. Thanks!!:)",

I would like to encourage everyone to INCLUDE the anchovy in the bread crumb mixture. Use your own proportions because a little goes a long way but the anchovy adds a depth of flavor that makes this recipe great. If you or your guests can taste \"anchovy\" you used too much! The little filets really do dissolve easily in the mix but if that disturbs you you can always buy a tube of anchovy paste.",
