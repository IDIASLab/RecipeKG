It's amazing how two simple ingredients that you have around the kitchen can come together for something that tastes so good. You definitely have to use REAL butter, (not margarine) that's softened and you'll get great results. I used this on bagels, but can definitely see a lot of uses for this stuff and add-ins like orange zest.... Thanks for a great recipe!",

Dinner guests always RAVE about this butter (little do they know how simple it is to make).  For easier mixing, be sure your butter (definitely not margarine) and honey are room temp.  Also, I like to use a bit of salted butter because it really does enhance the honey/butter flavor - I suggest half salted and half unsalted.  I tried just adding salt once, but it doesn't really disolve well, so go with the presalted butter.",
