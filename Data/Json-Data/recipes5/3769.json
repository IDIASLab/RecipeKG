I didn't have garlic ginger paste or green chile paste so I put four cloves of garlic and a fat piece of peeled, sliced ginger and half a small can of chopped green chiles in my mini food processor. I also put the cilantro and mint in there. I processed the mixture into a paste and tumped it into a large plastic baggy. I then added to the mixture juice from half a lime and 1/2 cup of coconut milk. Put the chicken chunks in there and marinated for two hours. I broiled the chicken for 5 or 6 minutes per side and served it with buttered jasmine rice with green peas. It was awesome! Even my somewhat picky husband loved it. Thanks for the recipe.",

UPDATE 18/06/2011:: This is a recipe that's been going strong in my house ever since I made it! I do marinate these in the fridge for a minimum of 8 hours (over night) to even 24 hours or even frozen for longer. I bake these first for 21 minutes @ about 175C and then flip them over and bake for anouther 21 minutes. Something I forgot to mention was to follow your own taste for the salt coz that's what I do since the salt proportion in the recipe seems way to much. These tikkas are much loved by all who've tried these at my place!:) Thanks again Heeru!",
