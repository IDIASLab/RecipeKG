And I don't like the bitter or slightly burnt taste they get when toasted further. I used a hand emulsion blender for easier clean-up and chopped the nuts by hand to a ground consistency. I wasn't able to get a strong \"butter pecan\" flavor. It wasn't bad it just didn't taste like much more than the ingredients were butter and brown sugar with some ground nuts. Maybe a drop of butter pecan flavoring may have given it that butter pecan flavor that I was expecting not sure? This might be good on some pancakes as a change to regular butter though with some pancake syrup.",

I used ICBINB spread and the only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the grainy texture from the brown sugar. I'm used to making fruit butters or adding honey cinnamon or extracts where the texture is always smooth. The graininess didn't kill it for me it was just different and the butter-pecan flavor definitely came through nicely. Don't skip toasting the nuts as it really enhances the pecan flavor in this butter. Thanks Carrie Mae for this new variation on a flavored butter.",
