Once that was done it was a snap. I cut the recipe down to 1/2 of what it was supposed to be and still had tons left. I definately recommend this dish but make sure you have someone help you cook the chicken. It's kind of fru-fru so I don't think kids would like it too much but a room full of women and a mom-to-be loved it.",

Place extra dressing on side. Suggestions: add shredded white cheddar cheese and really bump up the dill. Couldn't find lemon penne so I poured lemon pepper seasoning in the water when boiling the pasta. I grilled bone-in chicken breasts loaded with the lemon pepper seasoning. Still not enough lemon flavor so I would recommend adding the seasoning to the dressing. If you make this the day before be prepared to add more dressing as the pasta soaks it up in the fridge. Got rave reviews and presented very elegantly!",

Added 1c chopped red bell pepper 1c frozen peas 1c sliced green onions to the 1c chopped celery. For the dressing I used 1/2 mayo 1/2 nonfat plain yogurt juice and zest from 2 lemons 1t lemon pepper and doubled the dill. Stirred in a little skim milk to thin it out a touch.",
