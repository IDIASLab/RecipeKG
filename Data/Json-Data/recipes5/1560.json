I think that's all she put in it too; literally, pasta & cottage cheese (with a splash of the pasta water.) \n\nYears later, when I had a child of my own, I started making this for her (now adding butter/onion to give it more flavor.) Both ways -- just pasta/cottage cheese -- and then with the butter/onion -- were awesome (...but anything with some butta' is betta', ya know??)\n\nI forgot ALL about this \"dish\" then til recently when I was trying to use up leftover sour cream from Thanksgiving. And after doing a \"google search\" for ingredients, I fell upon this recipe ... making it yet again (now for TWO kids) :) - & with the sour cream this time, too.\n\nWow! Loved it even MORE (and didn't think that was possible?!) I mean, you can't go wrong with the simple, basic versions -- but that blob of sour cream really adds somethin'. It helped everything come together as a 'sauce' almost, instead of just cheese curds & noodles. (I think this is what kept the picky-eatin' kid from realizing this was anything BUT \"white mac 'n cheese.\" I know, I know ... it was a stretch, but he's 5 so he bought it). Yes! Win-win! \n\nTry it! I'm serious! It's not just for \"cottage cheese-eaters.\" When warmed up ... and with the other ingredients ... the C.C. loses the texture/viscosity & appearance that some people can't seem to get into. I can see why \"Lazy Man's Pierogies\" are a great title for this one!",

Then, because my pasta wasn't done yet, I thought I would add my cottage cheese to the onion in the skillet just to heat it up. Then, to my surprise, the cottage cheese melted into a smooth, creamy, cheesy sauce. Yum! I can't wait to try this again and add some sharp cheddar to make it more like macaroni and cheese and see what that's like. I also love the nutrition you get from all the protein in the cottage cheese! This is a keeper!",
