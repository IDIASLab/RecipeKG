I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and lemon pepper and then placed them in a plastic bowl and covered with water and then placed a chicken bouillion cube in. Covered with plastic wrap and microwaved for 13 minutes. After this was done and cooled I cut into cubes for this salad. I was out of Miracle Whip so I used 1/2 cup of low fat Marzetti's and 1/2 cup of low fat mayo. I used 1/2 onion and sliced a green onion for color. This is so so so tasty! It is very sweet and oniony. Thanks so much for this recipe my oldest son and I can't get enough of this!",

For the chicken I usually use the \"Cajun Chicken\" recipe from this site and grill it on my foreman. I make it the day before and have even made quadruple batches on a Friday night to cover all the BBQ's over a long holiday weekend.
