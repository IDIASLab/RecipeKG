The salsa verde makes a big enough batch that you can have more for dipping chips later. It is a great low-fat, all-in-one meal. This dish can also be topped with crushed tortilla chips, if desired.",

For my comments/suggestions: I used Queso Fresco instead of Cotija because it's much cheaper (less than half the cost). Also I seasoned the chicken with salt pepper and chile powder and I was quite happy with that in place of the cajun seasoning. I had one serving without avocado and I would say that is a must for the recipe. And lastly I would actually suggest skipping the lettuce.",

I used raw corn omitted the chicken and the beans and tossed the veggies with the salsa verde (which is what I'm assuming you're supposed to do but the directions leave you hanging). Great flavor nice texture and very pretty--good for a party. If you've never had cotija it's a very dry mild salty cheese; it reminds me of cheese curd. If you can find it use it (but I wouldn't sub anything else)--it really adds to this salad.",

I made the corn in the microwave and wish I had actually grilled it. I also didn't have red peppers so used green and added a little tomato garnish for color. The salsa was very good and had a different texture(which we liked) than most other verde recipes I've tried. The instructions didn't really say what to do with the salsa so I used it as dressing. I think I would prefer mixing some with the avocado mixture to \"disperse\" it better as it's rather thick and doesn't really pour. I like a little taste in every bite and the overall dish was a little \"dry\" served as it was. Without the lettuce it would make a pretty good summer side dish that would hold up well. Thanks Jenny (and the Recipe Group)",

I prepped everything and then put the avocado mix on some Boston lettuce leaves adding the salsa verde on top (as stated it doesn t say what you are supposed to do with it) Queso Fresco on top of that chicken on the sides and garnished with lime wedges. The cilantro overpowered the salsa for me I don t care much for it anyway. The salad as a whole seemed to be just dry raw veggies with chicken. If the salsa is supposed to be mixed in with the avocado mix that may account for the dryness part. Although I did mix it all together before eating. I didn t care too much for it and added in some Catalina dressing. A nice southwest dressing would go wonderful here. Hubby liked it and added more of the salsa to his. Thanks for the recipe.",

And it also made it a little pricey to buy them all. I decided to make the dressing one day and the rest of the salad another day. I followed the recipe exactly except I broiled the chicken breast used queso fresco and 3/4 cup of cooked frozen corn to save a little time. I also had to use iceburg lettuce because the leaf lettuce I bought seemed like it had turned even though I had just purchased it. I loved the salsa verde and will use that again in other recipes or as a chip dip. Now that I have the cajun spice I might make more broiled chicken with it for an alfredo or other recipe. But making all these components for one salad was a bit much to me. It was tasty it just seemed like a few separate recipes combined to make one that are great on their own. I would also not consider this to be a good representation of Cinco de May though as it is not a classic dish although that has nothing to do with the recipe. I do think this salad would be perfect for a January diet resolution though as it is loaded with nutrients and fiber!",
