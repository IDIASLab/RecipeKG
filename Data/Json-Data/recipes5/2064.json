She taught me how to make them and that's a memory I'll always treasure as she got the recipe from her Mom. Now that she's gone I think of her everytime I make them. She served them with mashed potatoes or sometimes potato salad. I hope you and your family enjoy them as much as I do - it certainly has become one of my husband's favorites! Depending on the size of the green bell peppers, you may not have to boil them for 4-5 minutes, but maybe 3. I use large eggs and 90/10 lean ground beef when preparing these and sometimes add a little more vinegar to the tomato sauce or fresh minced garlic vs. garlic powder (yes, I tweak my own recipes and just for clarification - the beef is not cooked before hand). You can even sub half ground turkey or use all ground turkey for a healthier, lighter version. Enjoy!",

I used frozen bell peppers from last summer's garden.  As the peppers were soft when they defrosted, I skipped cooking them in boiling water.  I tried not to stray from the recipe, but when I went to do the dishes, I found the egg still sitting there lightly beaten.  It didn't seem to be a problem.  The cooking time was right on and our dinner was FABULOUS!  Thank you for sharing your family recipe, Jillian I'm sure you make your family proud!",
