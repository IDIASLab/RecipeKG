Once I mixed it up and realized I had way more than I needed, a side of me said to simply bag the rest and use it another time (it would have been great on shrimp!).  But what I ended up doing was to coat the entire tenderloin with the mustard/garlic mixture, then completely cover it in the bread crumb mixture and drizzled a little olive oil over the top. To prevent it from getting soggy on the bottom, I roasted it on a rack I placed on a cookie sheet. My tenderloin was almost exactly a pound, and it cooked to perfect tender and juicy perfection at 425 degrees for 25 minutes. This is one of the better pork tenderloin recipes I\u2019ve tried, uniquely flavorful with elegant, company-worthy presentation.  I used fresh thyme, using the rule of thumb three times as much as dried.  I served this with Oven-Roasted Potatoes and Savory Summer Squash, both recipes also from this site.",

I think it turned out well, the pork was tender and the breadcrumb cheese spice mixture stuck to it just fine.  Next time I may try olive oil instead of the mayo.  I worry the crust will not stick, but the flavor may be more complementary.  \n\nUpdate: I saw on a cooking show recently where sour cream was used to make a crust stick to a roast.  Maybe that could work here also?",
