To the folks who found that their coleslaw was sitting in a watery, soupy mess after a while, here's the way to stop that from happening:\n\nAfter you've shredded the cabbage, toss it with 1t salt in a colander. Let sit over a bowl or in the sink for an hour or so. 4C of cabbage will have sweated about 1/2C of liquid by that point! Rinse the cabbage, drain, and dry with paper towels. Proceed with recipe and get thick creamy slaw!",

Do NOT use low-fat mayonnaise (I should've known that) and mix mayo with brown sugar before adding liquids for creamier results (otherwise gets curdled appearance, even when using a whisk).  I added pineapple tidbits.  I left skins on apples (used 2) and chopped in shape similar to pineapple tidbits.  I garnished with apples slices and pineapple tidbits on top so everyone would know the unusual ingredients were in there.  Next time I might add FRESH parsley.  Very yummy.  Dressing was very light, nice alternative to the heavy mayo or the vinegar dressings.",

I had a fresh pineapple on hand so I added about 1/2 cup of that finely diced. I subbed cider vinegar for the white but I'm sure it would be equally good either way. To make it a main dish salad I chopped up a grilled chicken breast and added it in. A very delicious way to eat my fruits and vegetables thank you!",

Instead, I added 2 teaspoons of finely shredded coconut right on top of the chopped apples (highly experimental) and the juice from half a lemon, and I was sooooo happy I did! The coconut flavor is light but noticeable and soooooo good with the apple flavor! I also mixed the wet ingredients together first like others suggested. Mine was not soupy at all because I used pre-shredded cabbage (cole slaw mix) from Sam's. I'm pleased with how light the dressing is because it doesn't make me feel guilty for eating it!",

I added 2 stalks of celery finely sliced. I also had garlic rice vinegar so I substituted that as well. I added Mrs. Dash and salt in the seasonings.
