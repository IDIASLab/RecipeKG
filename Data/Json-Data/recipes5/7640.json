The broth used to poach the fish can be easily multiplied to create a wonderful soup to which you can add tomatoes, beans, green peppers, and any other veggies you would like. Serve with any green veggie and either noodles, rice, or potatoes to make a full meal. Enjoy!",

Just be sure you aren't buying Arrowtooth flounder, as that variety tends to turn to mush when cooked.   I loved the ease of letting the fillets cook in the hot liquid with the heat turned off.",
