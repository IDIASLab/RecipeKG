I was going to only put the one tablespoon of salt into the mix, but being the first time making this, I went ahead with the whole am't.  BIG MISTAKE! Probably one to 2 TEASPOONS are all you need.  I only had about 3TBSP of lemon juice, but that seemed fine.  I mixed the ingredients then let them set in a covered nonplastic bowl for about 2 hrs, until we were ready to eat, hoping to give the flavors time to meld.  The flavors were very good tasting, except for being over powered by too much salt.  I would make this again.  Served it with mixed cooked rice, but could have served it with any wrap or added a vegetable.",
