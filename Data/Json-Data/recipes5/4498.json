There is no feta cheese or vinegar in the original recipe...but it tastes good and the lemon and vinegar are a smart solution for the lack of sourness in the sour cream!",

I was lazy and did not further crumble my feta so there were big chunks throughout. We all really enjoyed this; thanks for a great recipe 5thsis! Oh I served w/assorted crudite and pita bread.",
