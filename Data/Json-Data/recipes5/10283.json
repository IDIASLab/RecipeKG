One of my favorite things to cook now !!!!!",

Instead of frying them....I place them on a broiler pan and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Then I broil them for 5 mintes, flip them and broil another 5 minutes. They are perfect!!! I hate meatballs, but the first time I made them my husband and I were fighting over the last few.....we eat them with nothing on them....we would not want to ruin a perfect flavor!  Thanks for a great recipe!\r\n\r\nPS- I have tried them on the stove and I agree with the other posts...do these in the oven and you will not be sorry...this is the best...made them again tonight and did it all in the food processor I got for Mothers day....try them....they ROCK!!!",

I had a huge quantity of ground chuck to use up today so I made a double batch. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs rather than the crushed croutons. I also used Spicy Brown mustard rather than yellow. This recipe seemed to call for too much Worch. sauce but it worked and possibly is the key to the moisture of this recipe. I baked these for 20 minutes at 375F on foil lined baking trays. I should have swapped the trays positions after 10 minutes as one tray was more done that the other but no biggie. They had a nice kick but didn't seem overwhelming to me. I wasn't sure what Cajun Spice was and I had a lot of spices in store so I used one packet of Emeril's essence for a double batch of these meatballs. The meatballs are currently being \"individually\" frozen on the same trays so I can bag them for later. Thanks for a nice addition to my recipe file.",

I used Creole seasoning instead of Cajun, and my mustard was of the dijon variety.

But they're great! All of the flavors of these particular ingredients blend together so well that they'll probably be good in any sauce. I've used them in spaghetti and also a ketchup/brown sugar/Worcestershire  sauce. They're outstanding! I did not pan fry these, though. I just put them under the broiler for about 15-20 minutes, and then tossed them into my sauce. Also, I don't keep any Cajun seasoning on hand, so I just used good old salt and pepper. Works every time!!!",
