You've got to keep in mind that the fish will continue to cook as it is cooling and then once the patties are assembled it gets cooked another 8-10 minutes. I had a bit of green bell pepper that needed used so I diced it up and added it to the mixture and it went good in there too. I recommend this recipe but just be sure to not overcook your fish.",
