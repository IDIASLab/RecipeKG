So I cooked one pound boneless thighs (that's what I had--will try with breasts next time) in a skillet about 6 minutes per side and spooned the apricot glaze over them during the last 2 minutes. Made the glaze with 1/4 cup preserves 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar and 2 tsp brown sugar. (Will probably add 1/4 tsp Dijon next time.) Removed them to a serving plate and poured the pan juices over. Very good and moist. And the total time was about 15 minutes.",
