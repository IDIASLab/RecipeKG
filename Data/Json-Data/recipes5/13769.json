I also used Canneli beans as that is what I already had in the house. Oh' and I omitted the caraway seeds. I served this with some warm dark rye bread and real butter. YUMMY!

We don't have Great Northern beans here in Australia as far as I know so did a search on them & since they are a white bean I figured cannelloni beans would do. So I did the soak them overnight method rather than use cans. (have the rest in the freezer) Anyway made the soup pretty much as is except no carraway seeds cos I didn't have any. Will find some for next time though. This is a hearty soup & tomorrows left overs should be better of course! Can't wait!:-) Oh & I didn't use a really cheap stewing meat either cos DH doesn't like meat so used some a bit better & it cooked up beautifully. A must recipe for winter! Will make again for sure. Oh & for the non meat eaters you can do it as easily without the meat in it & use vegetable stock instead. I think it would be as good. & save some money too! Put in a couple more potatoes & carrots & you'd be set with a great vegie meal.",
