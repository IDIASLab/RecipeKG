We are on the Daniel Fast, and this recipe turned quinoa into a mouth-watering, flavorful fusion of fresh ingredients!  I used red bell peppers instead of green, and it just added the perfect amount of color to make the dish beautiful.  I wish I had taken a photo of mine--next time.  I will keep this one forever and even make it for company to introduce others to the wonderful world of quinoa!  Thank you HeidiM!",

I completely understand the prior reviewer's comment that they went back for seconds--not because they were hungry--but because it was so flavorful (we did the same). I paired this with a sweet slaw made with green cabbage, raisins, apples, mayo, and maple syrup, which made a nice contrast between soft and spicy and the sweet and crunchy (my husband requested that when I make this recipe again that I make the slaw again, too, to go with it.\nI made the recipe as written except for a couple of minor changes: I didn't have low sodium soy sauce on hand so I reduced the soy sauce by half; also, because my family doesn't tolerate spicy heat as well as I do, I used only 1/2 tablespoon of the hot chili paste and it worked well for them...just a background hint of heat without being uncomfortable.\nYep, this one is a keeper!",

I modified it to use on-hand ingredients: tofu instead of edamame; ground red pepper instead of hot chile paste; ground ginger instead of fresh.  As I was also cooking for a carnivore, I incorporated the Shrimp Quinoa recipe that I found on this site which called for asparagus, raisins, and mushrooms.  Since I didn't have enough asparagus for two (& hubby doesn't care that much for it), I also added broccoli. Both frozen vegetables defrosted in the microwave while I diced the onion, pepper, and garlic. I prepared everything for two until I got to \"step 4\" (adding the deveined uncooked shrimp prepared while the veggies sauteed) at which time I plated my portion (including the asparagus). Hubby enjoyed his portion too!",
