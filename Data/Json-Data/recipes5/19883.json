I loved cooking w/ alcohol and using spiced rum was a first for me but I went with it - thinking rum drinks are sweet and so I went for a sweet dish. I cooked the roast in a 6 quart crockpot for 6 hours w/ the liquid and brown sugar suggested. But I also added white onion cubed raw sweet potatoes chopped carrots and the pineapple rings. It came out very nice and sweet and the aroma was fantastic. I couldn't say I tasted the rum but I think the combo came out very good. My 3 year old loved it and I have plenty of leftovers for lunch/dinner this week!",
