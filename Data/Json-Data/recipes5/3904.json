Instead of a blender, I used a Braun handheld mixer which would allow me to 1/2 the recipe for next time.\n\nOne suggestion - use UNsalted butter.\n\nUpdate: Round 2 - Unsalted butter made a big difference, highly suggest it.  Also, was able to 1/2 the recipe using a Braun hand blender - 1/2 of all ingredients listed (used 2 egg yolks).",
