Seriously, how did it take until 1949 for someone to think of this combination? We all get hangry sometimes, so whether you're a broke student or an older professional who just wishes you were, this cheap, filling bowl of goodness is the perfect solution. Garnish with green onions.",

This Hawaii girl has NEVER had Loco Moco without lots of carmelized onions layered over the ground beef/fish/spam. The gravy was too salty without the addition of sweet carmelized onions to offset the saltiness.  I  think you took a simple dish and made it way mo complex than it has to be.  Come on over and I will make you real Loco Moco ;)",
