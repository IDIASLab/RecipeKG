I'm a college student so I never have everything the recipe calls for... so here is what I used: Chicken breasts red wine vinegar sour cream salt pepper mozzarella cheese. Combined wine vinegar sour cream salt pepper and chicken in a ziploc bag mixed well and then placed in fridge for an hour. Placed in pan baked at 350 for 25 min. (2 pieces) 10 min before completion added remaining sauce put a slice of fresh tomato and mozzarella cheese on top and baked remaining time. Whala!! It turned out great. The wine was not strong just enough that you could taste it. The tomato I feel complimented the sour cream and wine wonderfully and added a nice look to the meal. I rate this 5 because it led me to make something amazing! Please note that I only used this as a base for something else.:)",

I used a dijon mustard and pounded the chicken breasts before marinating overnight. Then I baked them in the marinade as another reviewer suggested but the marinade liquified and managed to poach my chicken breasts. There wasn't any \"sauce\" to serve with the perogies I made with it just a vile looking liquid. The hubby said it was not too bad and we convinced our toddler to eat it by promising brownies but it was rather discouraging. I'm usually a good cook and I did everything correctly so I guess the best I can say is if you are especially fond of vinegar have at. I would rate this lower based on flavor alone but I did cook the marinade with the chicken so I'll leave it at a two in good faith.",
