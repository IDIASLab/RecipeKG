Not too many of them are orange and/or have carrots so this one is a nice addition to the repertoire. I omitted the salt because I didn't feel the need to add any more sodium to my diet than I'm already getting. I didn't use dates since I don't keep them around. I did add ice as I always do because I like the texture with it.",

I cut the recipe in half and the only two things I did different was subbed dried prunes for the dates and I didn't have the flax seed powder to add. I also did peel the apple as it didn't say. The thing I did not care for was the ingredients didn't seem to come together at all. It tasted quite tart from the lemon a little like a banana and orange smoothie yet kind of like thick carrot juice. I also thought the dark specks from the dried fruit looked a little Halloweenish mixed in the thousand island dressing orange colored drink. The ice saved it some. I drank part of one drink no one else would touch it. I think it would have been much better like the first reviewer made it. I would leave out the lemon juice salt and dates.",

I scaled this down to one serving used Greek yogurt and cored but didn't peel my red MacIntosh apple which enhanced its eye appeal. Followed the recipe to the letter (except no salt) loved its creaminess and bright flavor and wouldn't change a thing. Thanks michimama for a new and healthy breakfast smoothie.",
