Thank God we were taking the final product to someone else's house.  After the pork was drained, shredded and all the other ingredients got added the smell got a lot better.  All we added after that was 2-3 Tbsp. of liquid smoke which I highly recommend.  The end product tastes like something from a BBQ Smokehouse Restaurant.  I served this with Creamy Spiced Coleslaw and Sweet Cornbread from this site and it was gone in no time.  I can't wait to make this again.  We'll just be putting the slow cooker in the garage!",

I am a displaced Tar Heel living in Alaska, and I would have NEVER thought that I could have North Carolina barbecue all the way up here without flying it in! I have tried lots of barbecue that has been touted as \"NC barbecue,\" and have been disappointed every time.  This is it!  I made the recipe exactly as written for New Year's Day and was bowled over when I tasted it. It was 10 degrees below zero that day, but it felt like NC at the dinner table! Anyone who complains that cooking the pork in vinegar makes the house smell bad has never walked in from below zero temperatures to the aroma of Stamey's, Hursey's or Smithfield's! The only thing missing was the flavor that comes with slow smoking the pork, but I'll work on it.  What a holiday gift this was!!  ",
