Once the soup simmered a little bit more than called for the flavor mellowed and was good. I really liked the sour cream and tortilla chips on it. I didn't have any of the other toppings on hand but red onion and avocado would have been good. The only major change I made was to use frozen corn as we are not fans of hominy.",

My hubby had thirds, himself, which is saying a lot since he usually uses more restraint when serving himself.

Thanks so much for a great recipe!!!",
