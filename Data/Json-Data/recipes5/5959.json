I made the recipe exactly as written, except I was unsure whether to use dry or cooked lentils. I decided to go with cooked, and used a pack of Melissa's steamed lentils (about 1.5 cups - I used the whole package). It's not til after I made the soup that I decided to check ChefJorge's personal version of the recipe and I saw that he calls for DRIED/UNCOOKED lentils. This was omitted in the editing process. I imagine cooking the dry lentils in the broth would thicken the soup a bit. Mine was a little thin, but definitely not a bad thing. The flavor was amazing and I'll definitely be making this one again. I loved the added tang of the lemon, and saltiness of the feta. YUM! Thank you ChefJorge for the delicious recipe!",
