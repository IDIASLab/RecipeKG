I browned the flour and onions a little longer than the recipe said to just until they turned a reddish-brown. I also didn t add as much stock as was mentioned in the recipe. I read the reviews saying it was too runny so I added it a little bit at a time. This was really a great sauce. I was looking for something other than the canned sauce and this hit the spot. It wasn t too spicy so if you re looking for spice add a jalapeno or two. Thanks!",

The nice thing about this recipe is that you can adjust the chilie peppers to your taste and play with new varieties. My family has a long tradition of using chilie peppers. I learned it from my grandmother. Its really not as much work as this recipe says. Clean the outside of your chilie with a paper towel. Open the chilies and take out the stem and seeds. Over a hot, dry skillet (not in the oven), throw in the cleaned chilies. Heat inside and outside until it starts to get soft. You are just doing this to heat up the oils. There should be no smoking and you aren't really looking for a change of color. Once they are done, throw them in a pot of simmering water. Once the chilies are in, turn the pot off and let rest for 20-30 minutes. Save the water! After all that, I throw it in the blender and puree it. Add some of the water if needed to the blender. I like big chunks of garlic in my enchilada sauce, so I just pureed the chilies and left the stock, garlic and butter as is ( I don't use onion because I don't like them). It's much faster this way and still as tasty. Good luck!",
