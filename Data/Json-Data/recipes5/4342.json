It's not the best time of year for this where I live; I ended up using hothouse tomatoes cuz the romas were wimpy - and good avocados are hard to find right now, but I found some.

What makes it better than guacamole is that you don't need to dip chips in it so it's very healthy! The first time I made it I added the feta cheese but realized that I liked the bites w/o the cheese better so I omitted the cheese the next time. I also didn't add the peppers because I didn't want it spicy. I also used Gourmet Garden Cilantro Herb Blend for the cilantro. I use that in my guacamole too. It's wonderful because it tastes great AND it's already cut and mixed and ready to put into your dish. It provides better all around flavor because it's mixes into the dish easily and well. That's my advertisement for GG Cilantro Herb Blend;-) I would definitely recommend this recipe. It works great as a side salad main dish or on top of meat or fish. It's amazing that something so healthy can taste so good. And the healthy fats in the avocado fill you up.",
