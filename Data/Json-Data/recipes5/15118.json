It's an easy fix though just double the amount of Farro and broth and leave everything else the same. It's delicious once the ratio is corrected. FYI Farro is always chewy no matter how much you cook it. I didn't like the chewiness. If I make this again it'll be with rice instead of Farro.",

I used the entire 8.8 oz. bag of farro and instead of tomato paste I used a can of diced tomatoes (didn't have any Rotel).  Since the farro was quick cooking, I followed the recipe up until the farro was added and then followed the farro package directions to finish (which didn't involve the oven).   This was absolutely delicious and we will make this instead of rice from now on.",
