I recommend lining the baking dish with the dough allowing the excess to hang over the top edges. Also I recommend cooking the dough in the oven at least until mostly done while you cook the hamburger meat because for some reason(maybe the meat will not allow enough heat to build between it and the dough) the dough never cooked all the way for me. Even after reinserting the whole thing back into the oven for another 15 minutes. Also try topping with cheddar cheese, then lettuce, then chopped jalape\u00f1os and picante or your favorite salsa. Very good, very easy, very quick, perfect for any day! Especially after a long day when you just want to put an end to it and relax a bit!",
