The batter was way too thick I had to add another 1/3 cup of milk and probably should have added 1/2 cup as the pancakes were really thick and slightly wet/moist in the middle even after 6 minutes of cooking time. My sons thought they were okay 3.5 stars was their rating. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #Pumpkinfest",
