The recipe makes a generous amount of cheesy crumbles, and I press it all onto the fish.  It's important to make sure your fish is dry so that it all sticks well.  Using parchment is a great suggestion, as it makes cleanup easy.  I found that I did not need to use the broiler to brown the crumbles; it baked and browned fine without that, but maybe that's my old oven.  :-)",
