It breaks this recipe down into 4 servings; however with only a 9oz package of green beans and nothing else to bulk it up this dish will serve 2 at the most unless you serve really tiny portions.

I had a bag of 'steamfresh' green beans so I just cooked them in the microwave as directed on the package and in a small pan I sauteed the anchovies w/ the oil the garlic and I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes. I cooked that until the anchovies melted and then added the lemon juice. I tossed that with the green beans and seasoned them with black pepper. These were really great for something different and I'm glad I gave them a try. I will be making these again! Thanks for pposting.:)",
