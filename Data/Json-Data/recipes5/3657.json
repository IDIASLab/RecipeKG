You don't necessarily have to fry it   I didn't use this recipe exactly, since I found the lamb meat pre-spiced at my local halal meat store. I kept it in the fridge for 1 day and cooked (by baking in a shallow dish lined with foil) the following evening. When served with warmed pita and the traditional yogurt-tahini sauce it is great. My husband loved it!   BTW- the sauce can be made with some freshly chopped mint, about 2 freshly chopped garlic cloves, a couple of tablespoons plain yogurt, 1-2 tablespoons of tahini and a squeeze of fresh lemon.",
