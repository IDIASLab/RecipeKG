If you have time to let the flavors blend a bit more it's definitely worth it.  We're not huge salmon fans here - it's one of those foods we eat because it's good for you, so any salmon recipe we find where my family says \"Hey, this is actually pretty good.\" gets five stars and is a must-try for salmon lovers.  The only addition we made was a can of mandarin oranges with about half the juice - it definitely helped stifle the \"fishy\" taste even more, and it wasn't bad even before.",

While shopping I forgot the pecans and ended up using walnuts which I toasted and they were excellent (anyway probaby better for you since higher in Omega-3s). I found the mustard a little tart so I added 1T of sugar to make it a litter sweeter. Next time I might try a honey-musard for the dressing. Will definitely make again.",
