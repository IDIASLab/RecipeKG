We use a doubled version of this recipe and make it at least once a week, and freeze them, leaving out 4-6 to eat immediately :)  Then each day, we take a few out.  They defrost on their own in probably 1/2 hour or so, but 20 second in the microwave makes it even faster.  In any case, they taste fresh baked.\r\n\r\nWe also like to add 1 cup of chopped walnuts (not too finely chopped) and recently my wife has taken to adding 1 1/2 cups of raisins.\r\n\r\nAnother variation is that we have taken to greasing a cookie sheet and putting a  tablespoon glob and making big \"cookies\" out of them, and they actually are more convenient to eat.\r\n\r\nI can't say enough good things about this recipe.  It's just the best.  Well worth the effort, especially if you're like me, and just like the idea of having a good tasting source of roughage in your diet.  And they are so easy to eat on the go.",

I prefer to use a more traditional quick bread/muffin method: Combine the oat bran and applesauce first, and let them sit together to soften the bran.  Combine the eggs, sugar and oil in a small bowl.  Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Add the egg/sugar mixture to the hydrated oat mixture, then quickly combine with the dry ingredients.  You'll get more tender muffins with better lift because you're not developing the gluten in the flour, and you get better lift from the baking powder if  you don't let it sit after it gets wet.  This recipe is almost exactly the same as the one on the Hodgson Mill website and I've been using it for years.  It's a good basic recipe.  My favorite add-ins are butterscotch chips and chopped walnuts, and a bit of vanilla (add with the egg/sugar mixture).",

The applesauce I used was my own homemade applesauce that was seasoned with homemade apple pie spice. To add a little \"something\" I threw in a half cup of organic raisins that I soaked in hot unsweetened chai for 20 minutes (I drained and patted them dry a bit before doing so). My muffins turned out really moist perfectly sweet and with me using the spiced applesauce and raisins that added a really nice touch. The kids loved these. If you don't use a cinnamon-spiced applesauce I think you should. These muffins need a little oomph.",
