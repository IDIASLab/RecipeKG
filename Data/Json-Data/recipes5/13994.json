I left it out, but chose to add some chopped green onion instead - just enough for a hint of its flavor and color contribution. Otherwise, this is an excellent salad, simple with just a few ingredients and unadulterated with distracting seasonings. The yellow pepper and celery are mild flavors, so they add color and texture without being imposing. Because I used lobster tails I did not shred the meat as directed, preferring to leave the lobster in nice, meaty chunks. That too, contributed great color and made the salad especially pretty. I served this on a bed of mixed lettuces alongside a scoop each of egg salad and cottage cheese, and a few sliced tomatoes. That and a bowl of creamy tomato basil soup made for the perfect, decadent, light summer meal.",
