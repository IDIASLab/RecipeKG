Chicken or vegetable broth, extra garlic, and extra thyme & rosemary. I prefer using broccoli over spinach for much more taste. \n\nAs a final touch, three necessities:\n\n1. Fresh Parsley! About a handful chopped. Really adds a fresh taste.\n\n2. Good Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Stir in about a 1/4 cup at the very end. Can't make a decent italian soup without using a decent olive oil.\n\n3. And finally, some freshly grated quality parmesan cheese on top. None of that store shelf canned stuff. Good cheese goes a long, long way.",

I can say for certain that Italians wouldn't use vegetable oil, so it wouldn't be used in soup either...change to olive oil.  The soup looked like it needed a serious boost of flavor, so I started by using some homemade chicken broth I had in the freezer that also had pieces of chicken in it - and no water. I didn't understand why the submitter chose to dilute her soup with water!   I also sauteed some chopped bacon (more flavor!) in a little olive oil, then added the onions, celery and extra garlic and thyme.  I think these changes really did the trick because this turned out to be really outstanding! I served it with a mix of freshly grated Parmesan and Romano cheeses, then gave it a finish of a drizzle of white truffle oil,  which took this over the top!  So with a couple of small but important changes this is definitely a 5-star soup!",

This is a variation of something I grew up with, which my mom affectionately called \"greens & beans\".  It was more of two side dishes sort of put together; not a soup.  Very, very much like mom's taste-wise.  Super easy and warming on a cold evening.  Served up with some chunky bread and a glass of wine ~ fantastic!  Another suggestion; in addition to the parmesan cheese on top, drizzle evoo (extra virgin olive oil) on top and add more fresh cracked pepper...delish!",

I soaked 1 cup of cannelini beans in water the night before and simmered the beans for about an hour until soft.  I added the thyme to the vegetables as I was sauteing them in olive oil. If it's a good olive oil, the taste is hard to beat.  I added 3 tsp. or chicken base along with the vegetables and a TB. of tomato paste.  I used a hand blender to blend the soup and then added a handful of macaroni.  I did not add any salt as there's a lot of salt in the chicken base.  A very satisfying soup.
