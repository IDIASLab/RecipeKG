Next time I'd add half the whisky cook for 20 minutes then add the remaining half just before taking it off the heat. Or add the whole amount at once but with only 5 minutes or so left to cook. I think that'd leave more of the tipsy flavor - yum yum! I would definately make this again. You could also easily make variations with different fruits.",
