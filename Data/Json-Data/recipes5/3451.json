Made brown rice and fresh green beans with it and it turned out to be a very delicious and healthy meal.  I can't wait to have it again!",

Along with that minor tweak I also let the chops marinate for about 4 hours. I found them to be quite nice and very easy. I think what I liked the most out of this dish was not even the end result but just the fact that the only ingredient I had to buy was the pork chops. Next time I think I'm going to throw in some onion slices and fresh mushrooms in the dish and let them cook with the chops. Too counteract the saltiness of the pork chops I paired them with sauteed apples and a light pasta.",
