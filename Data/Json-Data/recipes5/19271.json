                "reviewBody": "After cooking this for several years, I have some advice to make it quicker and less messy:\n1) Don't worry about twisting the bacon.  Cut your packs of bacon in half, shake them in a bag of the brown sugar mixture, and then lay them very tightly packed onto an aluminum foil covered cookie sheet that has been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  They taste so delicious no one cares if they are twisted or not!\n2) Immediately after removing from the oven, put each piece on cookie cooling racks that have been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  Don't let them touch! I also put wax paper beneath the racks because that praline mess will drip.  Let them cool and set.\n3) Just add 1 tsp. of allspice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg. The clove adds something extra, just like when you stud ham with whole cloves.\n4) Use the cheapest bacon you can find and definitely not thick cut.\n\nEveryone in my community loves this recipe and it has become the dish that is asked for the most when I attend parties.  A friend of mine's son had some serious medical problems lately and he said that Candied Bacon would make him feel better! This bacon cures everything!",

I begin by using regular cut bacon not thick and I cut the slab in half so I get more appetizers out of each lb of bacon. I let it come almost to room temp; I've found this makes it easier to twist. Then I put my brown sugar mix (I only use 1C brown sugar 1 tsp Allspice and the 1/4 tsp Cayenne) in an oblong container long enough for the bacon slices to make coating easier. I use the same temp and time in the oven and they come out perfect every time! I just made these for my in-laws who loved them and they've become my husband's favorite hunting snack!",

All I really taste is the sugar. I'd probably like it without the sugar though. Big points for the baking method--I don't cook bacon much and I'd forgotten how much grease there is in bacon. Even after taking the alum foil out of the pan and throwing it away I still had to wipe down the pan from all of the grease. However much less messy and easier to clean up than on the stovetop. My bacon is fresh from the farm (literally--bf's parents gave us some from their butchering) and it was thicker so it was a bit hard to twist but I managed a few. Thanks for the recipe. I'll try it again without the sugar. Lesson learned that we don't like that combo!",
