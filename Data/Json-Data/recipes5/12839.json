I had to use small crimini mushrooms because I couldn't find the other. I had to use romaine and a little rocket because I couldn't find any decent arugula today either. I could not find flat iron so I used my much prized prime NY strips well trimmed instead. Now don't go crazy on me folks because I made do with what I had. Loved the sauce and the mushrooms and everything else about this. This is fabulous! Sparky said he wants to have it weekly. Thanks for sharing Chef John!",
