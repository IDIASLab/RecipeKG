I always make a little foil packet for each fillet and close it up, leaving a little room for air to circulate inside.  If you bake the foil packets on a cookie sheet at 425 for about 15 minutes (slightly longer depending on number of fillets), the salmon cooks to perfection every time!  This is a great recipe to use when preparing salmon in foil packets... it poaches gently in its on juices and always comes out so tender and delicious!",

Try it, you WILL like it.  My only suggestion is to grill the fish, flesh side down first (facing the hot coals).  This allows the brown sugar to glaze the fish and seal in the moisture.  Then after about 7 minutes, flip the fish over with the skin side down facing the hot coals.  Don't worry about sticking to the grill, the oil in the recipe help to make this not a problem.  Enjoy....Thanks for the recipe!",

The longer you marinate it - the better. I tried grilling this on a bbq - and it came out very good but didn't hold the seasoning in well (even though I wrapped it in foil). The second time, I wrapped it in foil again and broiled it in the oven - and the marinade really stuck. I use both the lemon pepper seasoning AND fresh lemon juice. I will make this recipe over and over again - especially since I live in the great Northwest where salmon is abundant. I think this would taste good with other types of fish also.",
