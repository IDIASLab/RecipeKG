Even though it's thin, the xanthan gum helps make it sturdy enough to pick up and hold all your favorite pizza toppings. Note that the yeast won't help the dough rise since it's lacking sugar to activate it; it is solely included to add traditional bread-like flavor. Shred your own mozzarella from a block of cheese instead of buying pre-shredded; the latter does not melt well.",

It was good hot out of the oven (I used the toaster oven) and the next day I fried a round up in some butter...toasts up nicely. The yeast gives it that bread flavor that is lacking in other keto bread recipes and even smelled like fresh baked bread while baking. The dough is a bit sticky when kneading but a little oil on the hands solved that problem. Will make again.",

Experimenting to put on the top of my pot pie. Will try to update to let you know how it was. I'm certain it would make a wonderful pizza crust. Smells delicious and I tasted it raw and it tasted like crust not cheese. That is a winner in my opinion!!",
