But I must say that I did make quite a few changes....  6 slices of bread instead of 4, 1/4 cup applesauce plus 1 tablespoon smart balance light instead of butter, added 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 2 tsp. cinnamon. Omitted raisins and added 1/2 cup walnuts.  While the bread and oats were soaking, I mixed together everything but the bananas.  I mashed up one of the 4 bananas and added it to the cinnamon mixture and let it soak in the fridge while the bread/oats were doing their thing for about 1 1/2 hours.  Baked for 55 minutes and came out perfect!  (see my photo!)  I recommend 'chopping' the bananas instead of slicing so that you get more of them distributed throughout the dish and you get a little in every bite.  This was great for dessert but even better for breakfast.  I think rum or rum extract would really make this yummy.",

I served with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled caramel sauce on it. It would not have been sweet enough for a dessert otherwise.

So, yes, I make some changes.  :)  But anyway, it's wonderful and obviously very easy to tailor to your liking.  We had it last night for dessert while warm (the kiddos put a little choc. chip ice cream on top, and I drizzled it with a little Hershey's syrup), and I just had some cold.  It's a great and easy way to have just a little something sweet and use up the stale bread ends and over-ripe bananas you have in the house!",
