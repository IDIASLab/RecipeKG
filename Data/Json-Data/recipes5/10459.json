Although I found that in order to cover the bottom of the dish and the first layer of oysters the same way Chef John does in his video I needed more like 5 cups of crushed crackers. I used half Chicken in a Biscuit and half Saltines. This is a great way to use up stale crackers! I used four 8 ounce cans of whole oysters but dumped half of the liquid that was in the cans. I've never bought fresh oysters so I don't know how much \"liquor\" is normal. If you used canned or jarred oysters be careful of the occasional small pieces of shell! I think next time I'll use a little more cream. Overall it turned out very good. The funny thing is that my husband didn't like it. Said it was too fishy tasting (which he doesn't like). I thought the exact opposite. I thought it was hardly fishy at all. Funny coming from a guy who likes oyster shooters (but I don't)! Oh and when reheating any leftovers watch out! When I pulled my plate out of the microwave an oyster exploded! So leave your covered dish in the microwave for a few seconds before pulling it out!",

                "reviewBody": "Like others, my north Louisiana family has been enjoying a dish almost exactly like this during the holidays at least since the 1950s (as far back as I can remember). We do not mix the crackers with butter, and do not really measure. Just crumble a good layer of crackers and top with oysters, closely spaced because they will shrink with cooking. We also add worcestershire, green onions, and some Tony Chachere's. Repeat the layers, ending with crackers topped with butter pats, then pour in milk until it looks right! :-) We always use fresh oysters, but I have learned that in recent years there is usually water added to the liquor so it is not very flavorful, and we do not use that any more. This is always requested and devoured by family members who like oysters!",
