While I also make this with veal in this case I used turkey cutlets a darn convincing subtitute for pricier veal both in appearance and taste. I floured the cutlets before dipping them in the egg and the bread crumbs. I made my own crumbs just seasoning them with my favorite Tuscan seasoning blend. These cook in just a couple of minutes per side so watch carefully! Once they're brown they're done! The sauce is rich and velvety smooth with the flavors of the wine chicken broth and cream blending masterfully into this simple but absolutely delicious sauce. I did add some fresh minced garlic right after removing the meat from the pan and cut back on the lemon juice - but that's just my preference as I wanted a more subtle lemon flavor than I knew I'd get with the amount called for. I served this with \"Pastachutta \" also from this site. I couldn't be more impressed.",
