I did have to change the buttermilk, though, I used 1 cup sour cream an1 cup milk  (allowed it to sit for about 15 minutes and then added my chicken pieces to it). Also, I used a smoked paprika and 1 Tbsp garlic powder (both because of my family's personal preference. Results they were gone as fast as I brought them out of Air Fryer.
