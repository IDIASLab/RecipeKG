We did not have sausage or mushrooms on hand so instead I cut up 4 oz of Mahi Mahi fish and 4 oz of Salmon and cooked it along with the shrimp. I also added some lots of Red Onions and Jamacian Jerk seasoning made by Tones (to taste) and only used about 2 tablespoons of butter instead. Turned out great! Oh I also added a pinch of frest cilantro and extra parsley. Yum! Will make again",
