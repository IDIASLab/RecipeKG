By browning the flour separately from the oil, the recipe calls for less oil than a traditional roux.  I'm thinking that less oil, reduced sodium, and cauli-rice contribute to the word \"healthier\" in the title.  Most recipes can be tweaked, to individual tastes, and this recipe is no different.  If you like celery, or okra, add away!  If you want to add some chicken, put it in.  I made the recipe exactly as directed, and I'm glad I did.  DH and DS enjoyed it, even without \"real\" rice!  Not exactly a one-pan meal, but it was satisfying on a cool, rainy spring evening.  Thanks for posting!",
