That's not an issue here since we're going with buttery, subtly bitter walnuts, held on with a very savory 'nut glue,' made with a garlic and mustard base. This protective layer of deliciousness makes boneless, skinless chicken breast taste like it was just carved off a freshly roasted carcass.",

I didn't have to look far at all when I came across this recipe. Having a detailed video to watch is always a nice bonus . . . and your helpful tips are always appreciated!\nI loved that this recipe had few ingredients but maximum flavour, and a neat method to \"glue\" the nuts to the chicken! The family really enjoyed it!! The only thing I might try differently next time is to cut the chicken breasts in 2 or 3 pieces before coating (which will likely require double the coating ingredients). Looking forward to making this again!",
