I love it as a substitute for mayonnaise in tuna sandwiches. This will be spicy! If you omit the adobo and chipotle, this makes a great recipe base for other creamy dressings. Rice milk can be used for the soy milk. Use your favorite fresh herbs in place of the dill. You can make sauce thinner with the addition of more soy milk.",

Two tablespoons didn't seem to be enough to get mine to blend so I added two more which ended up being too much resulting in a thinner dressing but that was my own fault. My husband and I both loved this and the best part was that he had no idea it had tofu in it. This would be great on fish tacos! It would be good on a lot of things actually. Thanks for sharing!",
