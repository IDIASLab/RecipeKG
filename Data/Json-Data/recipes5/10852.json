We didn't have buttermilk on hand, so we used skim milk with a little added vinegar.  Also used a cup of whole wheat flour instead of the white flour (with a teaspoon of baking soda instead of a half to make up for it) and used turkey sausage instead of pork.  Quite yummiful!\n\nNext time we'd like to use little cubes of cheese (and more of it!) instead of shredded cheese, as we felt the shredded cheese taste gets lost in all the marvelous ingredients.  Unfortunately, the pinch of cayenne wasn't noticeable....being from New Mexico, we plan to add chopped green chile next time.   Also thinking about scrambling about 8 or 10 eggs with a little salt, then filling each muffin tin half way with recipe mix, adding a tablespoon of scrambled egg in a small depression, then fill each tin with recipe mix the rest of the way.  We think the egg will get done, but not sure.  There will likely be closer to 15 or 16 muffins then, as our first batch of 12 were all quite big, though maybe that's because we didnt measure out the green onions, cheese, and corn -- just used a good amount.\n\nAnother splendid recipe, Chef John -- keep up the good work!",

I shortened the recommended cooking time by 15 min, and yet they were still dry.  The recommendation to add a soft-boiled egg seemed brilliant, but did not seem to work with regular-size muffins.  The egg filled the entire muffin cup and there was just a tiny bit of muffin mixture around the outside of the egg, which promptly fell off as soon as it came out of the pan.  Made 18 muffin.  My kids refused to eat them, and my husband said he would eat them on camping trips, but would not go for them at home.  I might play around with the recipe and see if it can be improved with more moisture and seasoning.",

I'm guessing they'll freeze well, so we'll try them out in lunch boxes, too. Main problem is that about a fifth of each muffin sticks to the paper liner. Next time I'll prep the muffin tins with butter and flour and hope for a better result. More than a pinch of cayenne will also be good: I couldn't really taste it here. I used good local sausage. Also used duck eggs b/c that's what I had: don't know if they made the muffins stick more than usual.",
