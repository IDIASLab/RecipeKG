The second time, I found a way to make spreading the peanut mixture easy.  After you put the peanuts into the caramel, the peanuts cool down the mixture and the cool mixture is hard to spread so I put the mixture back into the microwave and reheated it. Then I spooned the peanuts and caramel on top of the first layer of chocolate. It worked perfect, the hot caramel spread evenly and easily. I also used 34 caramel squares and only 1 3/4 cups of peanuts.  This is one of the best home made candy recipes I've ran across and, yes, it does taste a lot like a snickers bar. I took some to work and shared with employees and several ask for the recipe. I'll make this one over and over....",

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used only 1 1/2 cups peanuts.
