A couple tips:\n\n\u2022 you know an avocado is ripe when the skin is black, and there's a little \"push\" when you slightly squeeze it. Too much \"push\" and it's over-ripe; too little and it's not ready yet.\n\n\u2022 the pit will fall out as you're peeling a ripe avocado... if you need a spoon to get it, the avocado's not ready yet.\n\n\u2022 to keep the guacamole from turning brown, place plastic wrap directly on top of the finished dish, making sure to eliminate all air contact with the guacamole (it's exposure to the air that will turn it brown). When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and stir the dish with a fork.\n\n\u2022 This is ALWAYS best at room temperature.",
