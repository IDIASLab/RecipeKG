I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil; I used All-Bran instead of the wheat germ and flax seed meal; and I used Splenda Brown Sugar mixture instead of regular brown sugar ... oh, and I didn't have any honey, so I used sugar-free maple syrup.\n\nIt is really great, and this way it is lower-fat/lower calories, but I will probably only use about 1/3 of the recommended salt next time.\n\nAnd, unlike many of the granola recipes out there, it DOES make the \"clumps\" that make it yummy to eat just out of the bag OR w/ milk/soy milk.\n\nEnjoy!",

In the future, i plan on just making a double batch and keeping toasted nuts and dried fruits on hand to make up a different flavor every morning!",

I omitted the brown sugar and used 1/3 cup real maple syrup instead of honey; decreased the oil to 1/4 cup; and I used slivered instead of sliced almonds for more texture.  Oh, I might have tossed some oat bran in there too.  Didn't miss the sugar at all, and I like things sweet.  Mine only took maybe 40-45 minutes to bake.  When cool, I added some dried blueberries - Delicious, chunky, perfectly flavored granola!!",
