After I had the cookie on the pan I covered the \"opening\" with more spray before filling with a whole Jolly Rancher (works better than lifesavers). After baking just till the candy melts slide the whole sheet of tin foil off the pan and let the cookies cool completely. Turn the cookies upside down and peel off the foil. This is what finally worked for us. The results are beautiful!",

I had made similar cookies about ten years ago so was thrilled to \"rediscover\" the recipe. Instead of rolling dough into ropes I used a large house cookie cutter and cut out smaller shapes inside. I also used Lifesavers instead of sourballs. Some of the houses resembles churches some were schoolhouses etc. The effect was truly charming. I would recommend this recipe to anyone as they are not particularly difficult to make.",
