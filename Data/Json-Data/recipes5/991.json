I used leftover Easter ham and I subbed out the  noodles - I used noodles made from chickpeas and turmeric - cuz we do low carbs. Used almond flour instead of regular. I used a jack/cheddar cheese blend. Used only frozen peas cuz that's what I had on hand. Oh my gawd it was comfort food and filling, but without the \"I'm stuffed I need a nap\" or \"dangit, i blew my diet again\". So happy to have found this recipe!",
