        "description": "My first try at cooking lamb shoulder chops. A friend served lamb at a party and the meat was tender and juicy, but the taste was gamy and bitter. I put together this recipe to see if I could improve the taste and very pleasantly surprised myself. If you've tried lamb and didn't like the taste, as I did, try this recipe. I love it and think you will too. I served this with my Bacon Caesar Roasted Potatoes (you can find the recipe in my recipe box here).",
