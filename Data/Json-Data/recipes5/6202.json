I used a whisk to smooth out the roux. I love to use roasted chicken so the chicken is not too dry. I used two chicken breasts sprinkled some poultry seasoning on the chicken breasts with pats of butter. Then I placed the chicken in a oven proof pan with a lid and baked the chicken for 25-30 minutes. Thanks for sharing your recipe Staria.",
