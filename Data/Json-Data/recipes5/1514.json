The biggest thing we weren't sure on was do you fry the bacon fully/partial or not at all? We did fry bacon & egg softly. Hubs put left over potato on top with butter & sour cream. My suggestion is if using large potato use 2 eggs per small can get by with 1. If you do partially fry egg then after scooping out potato but a little butter/marg in before cheese. Then add other ingredients. It can also use more bacon if using a large potato. We decided with the extra potato we'd add marg maybe some garlic powder or fresh garlic bake & have along side. Will try with sausage salsa mushrooms or any other tidbits to try.",
