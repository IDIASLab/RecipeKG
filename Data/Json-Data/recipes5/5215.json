But I did change a few things just based on what I had on hand: light mayo and sour cream a whole cup of pecans which I toasted and I used a whole 15-oz can of crushed pineapple in juice. I also added a couple of peeled seeded and diced cucumbers from my garden since they needed to get used. Absolutely delicious! I served it with rich whole-wheat rolls at our church Game Night and it was a big hit!",

It was bland boring - almost tasteless - with too much dressing. We served it to guests based on ratings:(. The tastes which predominated were grape & the dressing (but with no influence from the curry powder which I bought specifically to make this salad Morton & Bassett brand best by June 2021 ). Celery apple and pecans added crunch which was crucial but no taste. Followed the recipe exactly (using fresh pineapple with its juice which should only have improved it). If you like very mild flavors plus grapes - not challenging to the palate - this is a good option. Or if you eat a lot of chicken salad & want something different try it but only if you have the ingredients on hand & don't spend extra money. I have a similar generations-old recipe from my husband's great-aunt and will be returning to that one.",
