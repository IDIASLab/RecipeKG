All I had on hand was mild tomatoes and green chilies and I think that spicy would have been better. This is a very meaty and filling dip and DH liked it a lot. I tried it with plain potato chips corn chips and tortilla chips and the corn and tortilla were the best. I did end up having to add some milk to thin this down throughout the cooking process but that was an easy fix. This one would is a good one to serve during football season.",

Based off of some of the other reviews and ingredients that I had I used the core recipe and made my own changes. I used 2lbs of ground beef. While frying up the meat I added about a tablespoon or more of Lea & Perrins. I then diced up a small Vidalia onion and fried it up in the pan. Instead of the cheese mix I used extra sharp cheddar. With these changes I felt that it had the perfect consistency and flavor that I was looking for.Now I'll be honest this did not remind me of a cheeseburger. This tasted exactly like a good Philly cheesesteak. I made this for a going away party and it was a huge hit. I will make this again.",
