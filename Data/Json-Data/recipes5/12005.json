                "reviewBody": "This has potential but as written it does not work. For starters it is missing an important step. It never does say what to do and where to add the onion/mushroom combo. I had to scramble and do a quick Google search for similar recipes and this is what I found. Shingle the bacon slices on a sheet of cling wrap. Spread the onion mushroom mix evenly over the bacon. Place backstrap on top of the bacon and roll so that the venison is completely encased in the bacon. From that point you can roll that roll in the puff pastry. Problem #2 was cook time. At 25 minutes this was at 106 F which is not safe. I ended up cooking for 45 minutes plus 10 minutes of resting to get it to 135 F. Overall great recipe and the puff pastry turns a beautiful color but this recipe needs some tweaks.",
