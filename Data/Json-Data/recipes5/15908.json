I made this up the night before waiting to add the avocados then next day when I served it. I make with my own taco seasoning blend adapted from 'Famous Taco Seasoning Mix' on the AR website. The carrots and celery were very crunchy right after I made it and didn't seem to go with the Mexican flavor however the next day they had softened up and the whole salad tasted much better so letting it marinate awhile is a good idea. I ended up adding some cilantro since I had some on hand a nice addition. This sure is a chock full of healthy stuff salad.?",
