I used dried minced onion since it was quick and the onions at the store look pitiful (about a heaping T worth for each onion). I used whole mexican oregano and for the salt I used 1/2 tsp of hot salt in the meatballs and 1/2 tsp hot salt in the sauce. I did add about a half cup of water and simmered this covered about an hour total. I didn't care for the rice on it's own but it went very well as a base for meatballs and sauce. I could have used half the can of mexicorn though as it seemed way too much. My son ate this wrapped in a flour tortilla. My husband didn't like this at all and wouldn't even try the rice but he doesn't like his meat with anything tomatoey. Thanks for sharing this it was really good.",
