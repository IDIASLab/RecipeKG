One thing I love about these is how customizable they are. Lemon coconut? Chocolate coconut? Sure! You can do practically anything with add-ins. These are also good because unlike other recipes, they use condensed milk, which gives it a rich sweetness. It's safe to say these beat the store-bought ones!",
