I doubled the whole recipe (except the butter- I only used 1/2 cup) and thought that the amount of caramel/chocolate/nuts called for was perfect; all the kernels were covered pretty well. Based on other recipes one cup of popcorn= one serving so I used 8 cups of stove-popped popcorn and used the same stockpot to make and mix everything. I think it would have helped if I had kept the popcorn warm in the oven before mixing it- by the time I got to the chocolate and peanuts the caramel was sticking. I baked in two deep aluminum roasting pans. This made FAR more than eight servings more like 16!",

I ran out of brown sugar so I used about 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup regular white sugar and it seemed to be no different. Go sparingly on the chocolate chips---I \"eyeballed\" it and ended up making the popcorn a little bit too chocolatey and overcoming some of the caramel taste. Also my popcorn started to burn after 45 minutes so I didn't bake it the full hour.",
