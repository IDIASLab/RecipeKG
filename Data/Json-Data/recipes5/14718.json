                "reviewBody": "This bread is phenomenal!  I think of it as low-carb gluten free! I made if following the directions exactly.  For those who got a dense or hard loaf, maybe you didn't use a mixer? Or maybe you didn't mix it long enough?  I used my standard hand mixer and beat the eggs at room temperature then added in the butter and olive oil.  Beat again to a smooth consistency.  Probably 2 - 3 minutes?  That's 180 seconds max.  You can do it! Then I added the almond flour 1 cup at a time mixing well between additions.  I also added the baking powder and xanthan gum between the first and second cup of almond flour.  I beat that mixture on high for maybe another 2 minutes tops after adding the second cup of almond flour.  It's a lovely thick/creamy batter that has an interesting consistency.  I had lined my loaf pan with parchment paper so the loaf would come out clean.  Make sure you level out the batter before putting it in the oven.  I baked mine in my convection oven and it rose beautifully.  Once cooled I sliced it and the crumb is absolutely lovely! Not dry! Not heavy! Not mushy! Not wet!  It has a nice eggy flavor (DUH...it has 7 eggs!) and I can imagine it toasted or used to grill a cheese sandwich!  Fingers crossed it will keep a few days.  I'll be storing in the fridge for good measure.  Thank you for sharing this.  It is seriously good!",
