If there is one thing I have learned about cooking it's that taking the time to do things the right way is almost certainly the best way. Sauces in particular can be tricky. In addition to taste, consistency is very key. I'm giving  this 5* rating to the Hollandaise sauce in this recipe. Yes---there is a ton of butter - there is supposed to be. Rich is expected in this classic French sauce. It is what it is. So please don't rate it if you are at all anti-butter and en route to the food police. Following the instructions exactly will produce a sauce near perfection.",

I started off with 1/2 cup of salted and it was heading down the path to 'too salty'. I finished it with unsalted and had success! I didn't need to season with additional salt at the end, but I did add some pepper. Really watch your egg yolks and don't stop whisking! I scrambled my first attempt trying to speed it up. THANK YOU for the wonderful, comprehensive instructions that even a hollandaise virgin could follow (if she weren't rushing!). The salmon was also poached to perfection, and I love the flavors the lemon juice and olive oil imparted. Lovely. Thank you again.",

The Salmon turns out wonderfully moist (as long as it is not overcooked, which I did on one occasion, my fault, not the recipe's) and the hollandaise sauce is really easy to make with a good double boiler ...creamy as it can be, even though I have to admit the first egg yokes I used curdled, because I had the water temp too high and too close underneath the pot (recipe reminds one to use only so much water and to take the top pot off from the water if necessary to prevent that from happening... in other words,  don't walk away from it even for a moment). \nBut what a lucious outcome...the hollandaise also goes great with asparagus, so we now always make a double batch of this sauce (it is easily reheated, using a microwave slow heat and then whisking it into shape! Eggs benedict!)Yummy. Thank you for sharing.",

Prepared and served as written (not a big fish eater, so there was no taste testing), she found the salmon a bit under-seasoned. The hollandaise sauce made the fish better. I will poach salmon again but with use vegetable stock (used chicken previously with water), a little bit more salt, a hint of onion powder, and will use a lemon and cracked peppercorn. Poaching with straight water is stewing  and water being a solvent, removes flavor.",
