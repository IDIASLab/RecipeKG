I used my normal hamburger recipe for the grill which is ground chuck Worcestershire sauce minced onion garlic powder onion powder sea salt fresh cracked pepper and a soft stick of butter combined into the mix. I used Nathan's hot dogs as they're my favorite and compared to the pic mine turned out quite a bit thicker than the ones pictured. They do take a considerable amount of time to grill. Considering the thickness I soaked and used wooden skewers cut into thirds instead of toothpicks. I would recommend bbqing them on low and the lid closed but keeping a close eye on them as the flames flare up quickly! These took me about 30 mins to grill on low. They were pretty good the men of the house loved them. Thanks!:)",
