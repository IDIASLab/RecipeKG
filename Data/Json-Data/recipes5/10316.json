Add garlic & onions to the MR saut\u00e9. Add 1 tablespoon Champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar and add 2 T sherry, marsala, brandy, or red wine. Sub non-fat plain Gk yogurt or Chef John's Creme Fraiche for the heavy cream. Brown the meatloaf before spooning the gravy over it. Serve with mashed or baked potatoes, polenta, risotto, egg noodles. I  have used my favorite meatloaf recipe and made it into meatballs which I braised in Chef John's MR Gravy recipe. I have used it in lasagna. I have even used it as base sauce after reducing down on pizza; pairs particularly well with goat cheese (other cheeses, as well). It is wonderful over roast beef as well. It makes (homemade) seitan taste incredible!",
