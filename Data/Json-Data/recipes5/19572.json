I didn't have just pineapple juice but I did have a can of crushed pineapple so I got as much juice from that as I could and then just used enough crushed pineapple to make 3/4 cup. Worked great! This would be a wonderful recipe for a pork roast pork chops etc. I was worried there would not be enough liquid but the plums cooked down quickly and it was just fine for 3-4 pork chops. If I made this again with a larger cut of meat like a roast I would probably have to add more liquid - maybe apple juice? We had leftovers so I shredded up the rest of the pork chops and then mixed a bunch of the plummy sauce into it - AMAZING. Better than the pork chops alone. Can't wait for plummy pork sandwiches tomorrow!",

I cooked the recipe for 3 hours on high and it was done perfectly - juicy and tender. My family liked the meat but they don't like runny sauce. So I tried straining the juices skimming the fat off and thickening them to make a sauce to serve over rice. I didn't get it thick enough and so that part was kind of disappointing. Next time I would try using 4 TBSP flour to thicken it instead of 2. I also used less vinegar - 2 tsp and I used red wine vinegar because I thought that flavor would go better. I know it is not fair to rate a recipe when you don't make it exactly as posted but I thought these changes might be useful to someone.",

As other reviewers have said 8 hours is way too long to cook the pork chops. I cooked mine for 6 and for the most part the meat was tender (if a side of the chop is sticking up over the cooking liquid be sure to turn it frequently to prevent it from drying out). I was a little surprised at how mild a flavor the cooking liquid imparted on the pork chops. I was expecting to taste more of a plum flavor but it hardly came through which isn't a complaint as the spices tasted very good with the pork.",
