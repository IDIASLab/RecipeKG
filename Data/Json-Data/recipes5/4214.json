It was a definite hit and very more-ish. \n\nI made a couple of changes simply because of what was on hand - I grated Red Leicester cheese from the block and used light cream cheese. I also ended up only making half a recipe but it scaled down beautifully. \n\nI would recommend trying to grate the red pepper and onion - even though it turns the ingredients into a sort of mush, they then blends into the cheese smoothly and evenly.",

It was such a huge hit that I have emailed it to several guests who asked for the recipe. Super easy and delish! I may add a dash of hot sauce or a whisper of chili powder or cayenne pepper next time for a little kick depending on the guest list. I halved the recipe and the ball was still large...great for making 2 or more balls and having plates in various locations. An instant classic.",
