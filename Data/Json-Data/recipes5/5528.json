I never by farm raised fish and lately thats all I have been seeing as well as color added to salmon?? So with that being said, I made a few changes. I hate cilantro. I hate the smell of it and the taste. Its just nasty to me. So instead of cilantro I used dill. I love the smell of dill and taste. I usually use dill with any fish I bake in the oven anyway. And instead of one tablespoon of lemon juice I used juice from a whole lemon, without measuring I chopped up a nice size clove of fresh garlic, instead of paprika I used a nice dash of red cayenne pepper, organic garlic powder, salt and pepper and used real butter instead of margarine. And I totally ditched the white wine. And as I was heating the mixture in the sauce pan, I gave it a little taste and it was so yummy. I actually am a fan of the fish too. Nice, light and wild caught in the US....doesnt get any better than that. And YES! I would soooo make this again! YUM!",

Almost all of what you buy in the supermarkets are either frozen or previous frozen and farm raised. It might have been caught by a US citizen but he was in the Mekong Delta when he caught it.\n\nThis recipe is very good and have used it for the past 6-7 yrs with either Swai or Basa. I add 3 tbl of oleo and 2 tbl of cilanto when cooking.  Also great on the grill or deep fried after dredding in egg wash and 'Dixie Fry' seasoning mix.\n6/27/04 - I am now just frying Swai with no egg wash.  Just adding a little Accent and paprika to the Dixie Fry Seasoning Mix. Swai does not shrink at all when frying and actually looks like it plumps up during frying.  With fish so expensive now this is a great buy.  Bought 4 lbs bag on sale last week at the supermarket for $9.99 per bag.  Cheaper than ground beef, for sure.  I would buy some more Basa but it seems to have disappeared from the supermarkets completely.",

Placed the fish on top of lemon slices so it wouldn't stick. I warmed the butter, chicken broth (not wine) and seasonings in the microwave at 30 second intervals stirring often. Poured this directly on the fish and since our fillets were quite thick they took about 20 min to bake at 350. Superb flavor. Even the 18 month old ate every last bit and asked for seconds. I also made a delicious risotto type of side dish using quinoa, mushrooms, spinach, Parmesan and some seasonings. I used thyme in the side dish and worried it would clash with the thyme but it was fine. Great recipe!",

I made a few changes - no white wine, extra lemon, extra garlic, and i added some garlic and onion powder directly to the fish. I have to say, I was complete BLOWN AWAY. This recipe was AMAZING!
