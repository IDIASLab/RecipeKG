I've had my breadmaker for a few years now and after using it a few times, I put it away because the bread it made was always too dry. Canadian all purpose flour is much different from US all purpose so it wasn't the type of flour~ I finally figured out it was the amount. Anything over 3 cups for a 2lb loaf is too much!   Anyway, this bread turned out to be moist and delicious! It wasn't too moist, it turned out like the SunMaid Raisin Bread I buy from the grocery at $4.99 a loaf. So...sorry SunMaid, I no longer need you anymore. The only things I did differently with this recipe was added an extra tsp of cinnamon and soaked my raisins for about half an hour before adding them to the cycle. Everyone LOVED this bread and I make it weekly now. Our favorite way of eating it is to slice a very thick piece, (we have a wide-slice toaster) cutting the piece in half and popping it into the toaster. YUM!   Thank you for this recipe, it's the best cinnamon raisin one I've found :)",

First off, CUT BACK on the yeast, both times I have made this the bread has risen to the steam vent. I stuck a knife in it it so it would settle back down, which makes a dense loaf (ok - just heavy).  \n\nI also didnt have honey on hand either time and substituted brown sugar for the honey. I also add 2 additional tblsp of cinnamon and another 1/2 cup of flour.\n\nMy kids love this bread, but only if spread with butter and a sprinkle of sugar.  It is not a real sweet bread but it is flavorful and good toasted with sugar and butter.\n\nThis is an ok recipe but I think I will keep searching for the perfect one without all the changes/additions/deletions.",
