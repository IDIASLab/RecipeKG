We like a \"crust\" on ours. So after 15 minutes of baking I pulled it up out of the liquid and placed it on a baking sheet. The spices stayed behind in the liquid so I added some all natural salt substitute along with more parsley and then stuck it under the broiler until it got that golden crust on it we like. I tasted it after 15 minutes and it tasted good but just needed more seasoning in my opinion. Easy fix.",
