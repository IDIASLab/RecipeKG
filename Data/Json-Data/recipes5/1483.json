The only change from the magazine version is that the submitter here uses 4 chicken breasts instead of 2.  This recipe makes HUGE dinner-size salads, so I'd recommend using the original recipe's 2 breasts instead of 4. Two breasts provide an adequate 3-4oz of chicken per salad when using standard sized 6-8oz breasts. I really enjoyed this salad and would make it again. There\u2019s not a ton of dressing, however once everything is tossed together and the juices from the veggies combine, it's perfect! I did have to add a sprinkle of salt, so next time I\u2019d salt the corn and asparagus before grilling. The chicken was more than done after 10 mins.  A perfect meal for a hot summer day.",
