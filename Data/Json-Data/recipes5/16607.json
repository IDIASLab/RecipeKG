You DEFINITELY need to add a bit more flavor- 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tspn salt, 2 tspns of cinnamon and I added a pinch of nutmeg(1/4 tspn)and some raisins. They turned out tasty and wholesome. I also substituted a bit of the butter for plain yogurt to reduce the fat further and used 1/2 whole wheat flour. I think if you want to you could even reduce the sugar just a little too. Good recipe as healthy alternative without losing flavor (if you remember these modifications above :)",

If you really want this to be a healthy recipe, make sure you're using home-made or \"natural\" applesauce - regular store-bought applesauce has processed sugars in it. I'd cut down the brown sugar, too, although I know that takes away some of the YUM factor! You could try a natural sweetener like honey or apple juice concentrate, or use Stevia. Honey is great when you're baking with whole grains because the whole grain binds to the honey sugars and digests it differently - your body doesn't realize it's sugar. Just a few thoughts. Great cookies. ",

First I am sensitive to wheat so I use a mixture of white rice flour and multi grain whole grain flour mixture that is gluten free. I do still use the oats so not 100% gluten free but close. I don't use the butter at all. Instead I use an entire cup of applesauce. I also only use 1/3 cup brown sugar and double the Cinnamon and add nutmeg and ground cloves for added sweetness and spice!",
