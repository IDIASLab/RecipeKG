                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent base recipe, but it lacks flavor and the ratio of ingredients should be adjusted.  Eight cups of water does not provide enough broth (at least if you're expected a result similar to standard chicken noodle soup recipes.)  Prepared as directed (and adding two more cups of water, there was far too much pasta and too little broth.  After we ate this and discovered how bland the broth was, I dressed up the leftovers with a can of chicken broth, onion salt, poultry seasoning and dried parsley flakes.  I think future enhancements I would make would be to rub the uncooked chicken with seasonings, because the cooked chicken didn't have much flavor, either.  I would also use about 2 cans of chicken broth (perhaps seasoned broth) in place of some of the water.\r\n\r\nI think this would be good in the slow cooker, simmering on low all day and adding the carrots and pasta at the very end.",

However I did make a few changes the second time around that made the soup even better. First much as I love rosemary I did cut back by about half. I also added closer to 12 c. of water and threw in about 2 tsp. of solid chicken soup base for extra flavor. Didn't have any penne on hand so I used multi-colored rotini (which was great and added color and texture to the soup). Finally I urge you to consider using boneless thigh meat in this recipe--soooo good! Not only does it offer a complex gamey flavor it's cheaper than buying breast meat!:)",

And yes I followed the recipe word for word! I guess I should say that I have only been cooking(other than frozen dinners) for about 6 months. The recipe sounded just fine however after the first part of the recipe was boiled for one hour I realized that I was in trouble. There was little to no liquid left in my pan. I still added the penne pasta oil and carrots anyway as described in step two of the recipe figuring that it was just my own lack of faith in my cooking skills that wasn't right. Well needless to say after the pasta soaked up what little remaining broth there was I was left with a thick mess of ingredients and no \"soup\"! I have sworn that I will never try another soup recipe ever.",

I wanted to end up with 8 cups for the soup and figured that I would probably lose one during cooking. I used 4 chicken thighs and some chicken tenderloin. I love rosemary so I didn't think that the taste was too strong. It was just perfect for me. I didn't use thyme just rosemary. Be sure and put the lid on the pot while you are cooking your soup for an hour and to turn down the heat to simmer or you will lose too much of your liquid. While the pasta was cooking for about 9 minutes I took out the chicken cut it into small pieces and returned it to the soup. I served the soup with garlic bread. The flavor was wonderful. My husband loved it. Will become a regular dish in our house. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",

I didn't use the 2 TBSP of oil I only added 1/2 TBSP of oil. I also added the juice of 1 sour orange. If you don't have sour orange you can substitute it with lime (to your taste). This recipe is great because it is healthy and all the ingridients used are without any preservatives and good for the body. I loved it!",

My mom is allergic to wheat so anytime we make soup with noodles we'll always serve wheat noodles and rice noodles on the side. Now even when I'm not cooking for her it's my favorite thing to do! No more overcooked noodles yay! would be very good with celery. I also buy a rotisserie chicken precooked anytime I have chicken noodle it's always much more moist",
