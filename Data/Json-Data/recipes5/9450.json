I'm blown away at how GOOD this is with such few ingredients! It's absolutely fantastic! The only slight addition I made was to add some red pepper flakes to the tomato sauce for a touch of heat. The cook times were dead-on, and everything came together so quickly. I made it for a super fast (and super tasty!) supper, and served it alongside some fresh spinach. Thank you so much for this recipe---it's definitely a keeper!!!",
