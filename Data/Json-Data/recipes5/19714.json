I used about 2/3 of a pint I had leftover in the freezer and heated that up enough to melt and mix the chocolate chips into. All other ingredients and steps remained the same this substitution just reduced a bit of the prepwork to create a fantastic brownie with a subtle hint of rum raisin that my husband says \"tastes a little bit like Christmas come early.\" Will definitely whip up again and probably experiment some more with other ice cream flavors in the future!",
