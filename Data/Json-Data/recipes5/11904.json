                "reviewBody": "5.2.20 Made this in my Instant Pot\u00ae using the Slow Cook feature.  The recipe doesn\u2019t tell you whether or not to drain the beans, so I didn\u2019t. Really, the only liquid ingredient in the recipe is the ketchup, and it\u2019s only a cup, so I knew it needed some more liquid. But I ended up with w-a-a-a-y too much liquid, the pot looked like soup.  Before I even added the ketchup, I ladled off a lot of the excess liquid from the five cans of beans.  I\u2019d recommend that when you\u2019re adding the beans, drain them, set aside the liquid, and then add it until you reach your desired consistency.  This is very similar to many recipes I\u2019ve made for Calico Beans, but they\u2019re typically baked.  I didn\u2019t add the liquid smoke because we don\u2019t care for it, I did add some salt and pepper, but this was just too sweet for us.  If I make this again, I\u2019d cut the brown sugar in half, but that just could be personal taste.  This was pretty tasty, and I do like that it\u2019s one of those meals you can make early afternoon and not have to fuss with it when it\u2019s time for dinner.  Angela, thanks for sharing your recipe.",
