I thought the mayo/sour cream mix was really good--the rosemary was just wonderful in this we thought. And the raisins were great! Otherwise there were a lot of ingredients in the list and we love them all. I didn't think they were all necessary. The chicken I used was leftover Lemon Basil Chicken from this site. My celery wasn't good so I left it out. We thought this gave us a great dinner tonight. I would definitely make this again. Thanks MARBALET!",
