I have made a few alterations/shortcuts I thought others might like to know. 1) I throw the chops in a marinade overnight of 2x apple juice to soy. The sweet and salt help make the chops even juicer. 2) I always make at least double if not 4 times the sauce or there is arguing... :) so when time is short or I just don't feel like peeling all those apples, I buy 2 cans of the higher priced pie filling and put that in the frying pan used for browning with a stick of butter.(scrape up the good bits.) It usually has the right amount of spices built right in so I just heat through. Arrange over top the chops in a baking pan. Bake covered in foil at 350 for 20-25 minutes. Remove foil - sprinkle with brown sugar and chopped pecans - bake 15 mins more for carmelize and crunch. DELICIOUS! Pairs great with butternut squash or sweet potatoes and corn or green beans. Homemade honey wheat bread is sure to disappear. I pour all pan juices over the servings for mopping. Every year when the weather turns cold here, the family starts asking \"Is it time for apple pork chops??\" :)",

After talking to my butcher, I decided to bake them. I first tripled the sauce, and left it to simmer on the stove, covered, for about 30 minutes...I also added about 1 tbsp of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it. I then poured the sauce over the pork chops in a covered casserole dish and baked it all at 350 degrees for about 30-45 min. It came out wonderful! It was so tender; everyone loved it!",

I broil the chops in the oven instead (usually 5-6 minutes per side) and cook up the apples on the stovetop so that everything is ready at the same time. Granny Smiths seem to work best.  I don't use the oil, salt, pepper, or pecans. I just throw the sauce ingredients into the pan instead of premixing them in a bowl and slice the apples right into the pan. I don't waste time coring them.  I just take thin slices off all around the sides till I get to the core. I let it all thicken together instead of separating the apples from the sauce. Less steps& less dirty dishes with these shortcuts! We have it with steamed rice. Quick & Easy.",

I made 2 batches of this since we were having dinner guests...they cancelled so 8 pork chops disappeared amongst 3 of us! Hey 1 is a teenage boy that usually won't eat pork chops.

For the chops I marinated them in salt pepper 1 TBL minced garlic and about 1/4 c. sauterne (white) cooking wine for only about 15 minutes. I then sauteed them while making the sauce. For the sauce I sauteed 2 small onions in butter until carmelized. Then added the other sauce ingredients -doubled (except apples). I just cooked that till tender and thought it needed some more \"juice\" so I added about 1/4 c. of apple cider then a pinch of cornstarch to thicken. Served chops over brown rice and sauce over chops died and went to heaven. Also picky boyfriend loved it;-)",

I sprinkled the chops w/ Paula Deen's house seasoning & sauteed them in butter & olive oil. Then I pretty much followed LadyJayPee's lead & sauteed an onion in the butter first addng the apples ( I used 4 granny smiths) but only cooking them for a couple of minutes. I also added a couple of tbp. of apple cider vinegar to add a little more depth to the sauce. Then I poured everything over the chops covered them & baked @ 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. Removed the foil & baked for another 10. Remembered just now that I never added the pecans to the dish so if you don't have any...never fear this dish is great w/out them. Srved them as suggested by the submitter w/ smashed potatoes & green beans w/ Raspberry White Chocolate Mousse in chocolate cups for dessert. Thansk for a wonderful recipe Karena...will have again many times!",

My picky 16 y.o. took one bite and said This is the best thing I have ever eaten. Her friend said she didn t like pork but would eat the rest of my meal. I told her she had to have one bite. She ended up eating a whole chop and said My mom s pork chops never taste like this. I did Brine my chops for 12 hours in 1qt apple juice cup kosher salt and cup brown sugar. I always do this - it truly makes all the difference if you want moist chops. Followed other reviewers - tripled the sauce and added a shot of Bourbon (YumO!!!). I used an apple slicer (8 pieces per apple) and I used 4 apples for 4 1 1/2 thick chops. I browned the seasoned chops on both sides placed them in a casserole dish poured the apple/sauce mixture on top and baked them at 425 for 20 minutes (internal temp 160). I served these with a brown rice pilaf and roasted broccoli.",
