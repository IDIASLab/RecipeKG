Additions I made strictly for personal taste: 1 can of corn and 2 small cans of diced tomatoes, as well as using potatoes to substitute for the turnips since I had those on hand.  The only disappointment was, even when following directions exactly,  my carrots and celery came out as total mush.  I will adjust the cooking time when I make it again so this won't be an issue.  All in all, you will enjoy this!",

Made with potatoes instead of turnips added beef broth instead of water and used a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce. Served with white rices. Only thing came out more like a soup than stew. But we all love soup so that was not a problem. Delicious and easy will definitely make again soon.",
