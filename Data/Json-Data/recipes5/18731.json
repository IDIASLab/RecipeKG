However, it was one that seemed so promising, I decided to tinker with it to make it \"mine.\"  First of all, I added a can of diced tomatoes, drained, with diced green peppers and onions, and some grated carrot to the tomato soup and cooked it all with the hamburg.  (This will make a lot, so I use the extra to make Spanish rice later on in the week....) I don't care for sliced American cheese particularly, so I used shredded cheddar.  I think there is way too much sugar, so I cut that back to a couple of teaspoons (the carrot is a natural sweetner, anyway, so less sugar can be used).  When I mixed the cream of chicken soup with the noddles, I also added additional shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Voila!  We love, love, love this recipe, and it gets served frequently. Wonderful comfort food! Great reheated, too.",
