I cooked whole shrimp in the chicken broth along with diced onion garlic celery red pepper and 1 habanero pepper (seeded). I removed the shrimp when cooked and set aside and diced. I then added the whole milk and brought the temp up slowly cooking the the veggies. I then added the diced avocado (more than called for) and shrimp and used the stand up hand mixer in the pot itself to puree about half of the ingredients. I added in the following spices along the way: Salt Pepper Old Bay Seasoning and Cumin to taste. I also added in a dollop of sour cream and minced cilantro to the bowls. Yummy!!! Boyfriend was dubious of the combination but LOVED it!",

With a few minor adjustments this soup fits the bill. If you're trying to make this a little bit healthier or lower cal skim milk does work. Made as directed I found the soup bland so I added some fresh cilantro and old bay seasoning. I did not puree the mixture but I mashed the avocados thoroughly before heating and I enjoy the chunks of shrimp - gives it texture. Tasty soup!",
