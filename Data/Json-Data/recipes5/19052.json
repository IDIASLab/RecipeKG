Because grilling was not going to be an option yesterday and wasn't quite sure what time the four kids would be meandering in I decided to make this in my slow cooker. One of my buddies from OurTableTalk.com suggested I add baby carrots into the sauce as the pork was cooking and I'm so glad I did. The sauce alone in this dish is so delicious and the carrots soaked up all of that flavor. The pork came out melt in your mouth tender and even tho I had a GINORMOUS piece of meat there was only enough left over to make the boys a sandwich for today. I froze the rest of the sauce which I will use when I make a chicken stir fry this week. Thanks again Austin!!",

I did not have OJ so I added some apple juice to the glaze & halved the amount based on the feedback from others...I only used about 2 tbsp total b/c it is rather sweet/powerful but complements the pork very well! I brined for about 3-4 hours and it definitely made a difference so juicy & tender!!!! It was my first experience with brining anything other than a Thanksgiving turkey now I want to brine everything! LOL I served it w/ some basmati rice & roasted carrots (tossed w/ olive oil s/p & sugar before roasting). Yum! Will definitely make again.",

Thanks for sharing!! The next day I cut up the meat sauted bell pepper & onion in olive oil. Added the meat and left over sauce to the veggies. Served with fried rice & egg rolls. My clan loved it!",
