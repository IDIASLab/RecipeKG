I decided to omit to stay with a truly fresh salsa, and it was wonderful!  The lemon/lime juice gave it a tangy flavor and the cumin added a nice zip.  I chopped each of the veggies SEPARATELY in a food processor to obtain the desired consistency for each ingredient and added it all to a bowl.  The end result was a very coarse salsa that did not have a whole lot of liquid and I was pleasantly surprised.  This was my first time using/tasting jimaca and it added a nice crunch.  I made this for the heck of it this afternoon, had several friends stop by unexpectedly and it was gone in a short time.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I served, but they loved it and I will make this recipe again (minus the Rotel!) after my next jalopeno harvest from the garden!  Give it a try!!!!",

It was much better using just 1 jalapeno no jicama and using sweet onion instead of red onion. (It was still \"warm\" enough for my husband but not too \"hot\" for me.) I have substituted regular tomatoes (de-seeded) for the romas and it turned out great as well. I usually just seed the jalapeno then throw everything in the food processor together instead of cutting everything up to save time.",

I did make some changes though so that could be the reason I wasn't a big fan. I was lazy the day I made it so I just tossed everything in a food processor and blended. Obviously the salsa turned out more thin than chunky by doing it that way. The salsa itself really didn't have any pizazz for me but I had 2 avocados I had to use up so I took half the recipe and bended it together with the avocados to make a sorta guacamole and now that was GOOOOD! I had to add a bit more salt but once I turned it into Guac I couldn't stop eating it. I ran out of chips and was temped to just eat it with a spoon. I will use this as a \"base\" for guacamole again for sure and I may try making it again as written to see if it was chunkier if I'd like it better.",
