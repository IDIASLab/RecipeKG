I LOVE spicy food but even this was a bit much. It was edible but not as enjoyable as it could have been. Maybe I added too much pepper. Who knows? Next time though I will use jalapeno peppers or some red pepper flakes just to be on the safe side. The combined flavors of the salsa were absolutely incredible. I served it atop a bed of rice and with Jay s Jerk Chicken as the main dish. Definitely try this recipe but pepper it to your liking.",

To be honest I married two recipes together so mine was a combination and it was killer!!! I didn't add the ginger and subsititued 1/2 Walla Walla sweet onion instead of green onion. I added 1/4 cup finely minced mint added 1/2 cup minced cucumber and I used 2 bananas finely chopped and the juice from 2 very large limes. I served it with pita (or you could use other flat bread) that I had brushed lightly with oil and Mediterranean spices and grilled that had been cut into wedges. The next time I will also grill some pita with sugar and cinnamon and serve it as a dessert salsa! WOW!",

Only downfall is you can't make it in advance or have leftovers because of the banana. I guess you could make everything else and just add bananas to the portion you are going to serve about 15 minutes before so that you can keep the rest in the fridge. Thanks for sharing!",

Two changes only: I used a jalapeno instead and I used roasted red peppers (in a jar) because I forgot the red bell pepper at the store. People seemed to enjoy it. A fine dice is very important for this salsa. I also recommend adding the bananas and cilantro just before serving as things tend to get a bit soupy from the acidic lime juice.
