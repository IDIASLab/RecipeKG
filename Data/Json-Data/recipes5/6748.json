                "reviewBody": "I would agree with Leslie. The custard is very good and worth standing on its own. I may pull that section of the recipe out and make it my go to formula whenever I need a vanilla custard for any other recipe. I regret to say that mulberries are not readily available at this time of the year or anywhere in my region so blackberries had to fill the bill. The recipe still worked. The timeline for each of the steps in the recipe were very good. One of the changes I intend to make the next time I make this is to increase the cooling off time to 30 minutes from 15 minutes. When moving the pie from the cooling rack to the refrigerator it was still quite warm to the touch and I was VERY grateful to get it on the fridge shelf and out of my hands. Another change I think I would make just out of personal preference is to make the graham cracker crust from scratch. I used store bought crust and it wasn't bad but I do believe if one takes the effort and energy to do the crust homemade the added flavor would be worth it. As to leaving in the fridge for 1 hour at least I would suggest no less than 2 hours and preferably 6. I cut myself a slice after 1 hour and the custard was 99% set but not 100%. After 6 hours the custard was much firmer. However if you are going to set something by way of refrigeration you can't go wrong with overnight. This is a very good recipe and I would recommend it for any summer table.",
