I have not ever tweaked this recipe - not even to add minced garlic, sauteed onion, pimento, etc; it's too simple and delicious on its own to need tweaking. This can be made ahead and refrigerated before cooking. It freezes well and can be thawed prior to cooking.",

                "reviewBody": "Love this. So easy and tasty. I made a few adjustments to use what I had on hand -- a 16 oz. package of thawed frozen chopped broccoli (I snipped off the end and squeezed the bag to drain any water) and a 24 oz. carton of low-fat small curd cottage cheese. I added an extra egg to compensate for the extra cottage cheese and broccoli and added a cup of sharp cheddar cheese, but left all other measurements the same. I saut\u00e9ed 1/2  a diced onion and 2 cloves of garlic in the 1/4 cup of butter before adding to the mixture and added 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. of black pepper. I sprinkled smoked paprika over the top. Mine only baked for 50 minutes and it was perfectly set. I sliced it into serving-sized portions and it came out beautifully. This is a great basic recipe that you could definitely add to -- chopped ham, bacon, cooked sausage would all be fabulous or other veggies so long as you're careful to saut\u00e9 to eliminate the addition of extra moisture. I grated my own cheese to cut down on carbs. Served it with mixed berries and it made for a wonderful Sunday brunch. Next time I'll cut the flour by 1 T to see if it makes a difference; if not, I might try eliminating it to make this a lower carb dish. Thank you!",
