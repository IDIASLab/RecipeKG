I like to use Granny Smith's in my crisps, I had nine smallish ones that were just enough for this crisp. I did add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping at the last minute. I have a Kitchen Aid that I used for the topping, I just threw the dry ingredients in the mixer bowl, then my cubed cold butter and let my wisk attachment \"cut\" my butter into the dry ingredients. Absolutely divine, used on hand ingredients, was cheap to make and VERY soul-soothing to make/eat. I highly recommend you try making your own caramel sauce.......it really takes your dessert over the top. Edited 10/11: I've gotten several e-mails on how to make homemade caramel sauce. This is how I do mine. Mix a quarter cup of butter, one cup of brown sugar, half cup heavy cream OR evaporated milk (depending on what you have on hand), and a pinch of salt in a saucepan over medium low heat. Cook until thick, about seven minutes. You can usually tell, it looks caramel-y. Add a tablespoon of vanilla and cook another minute longer to thicken just a touch more. Pour into a bowl and let it cool a bit before using.",

I bumped the cinnamon to 1t, added a touch of allspice and nutmeg, and 1t vanilla to the apple & caramel mixture. I didn't have quick cooking oats so I just used old-fashioned rolled oats, and they gave a nice texture to the topping. This will be my go-to apple crisp recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!\nFor the caramel sauce:\nMelt 1/2C butter (1 stick) over medium heat, whisk in 1C brown sugar, then whisk in 1/4C milk. When smooth, bring to boil then remove from heat. Yeah, that's all there is to it! :)",

Other than adding the cinnamon to the topping ingredients rather than stirring it into the caramel sauce I prepared the recipe as written and was quite happy with it just as it stands. I did however scale this down to two servings (two beautiful Granny Smith apples from hotel lobby) and baked it in a couple of smallish ramekin type baking dishes (350 degrees about 35 minutes). This stuff is awesome good - just the right sweetness crunch and delicate cinnamon flavor. After all this is CARAMEL apple crisp so the caramel taste should prevail. I can find absolutely nothing to criticize about this recipe nor recommend any changes. Neither can Hubs.",
