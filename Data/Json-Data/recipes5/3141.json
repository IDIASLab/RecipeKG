I increased the portions according to whom it was being served. I submitted this recipe originally and have updated it with the addition of the spinach. You can still use olive oil, but the basil or any flavored oil, and the addition of the spinach gives it a bit more interest and flavor. This is a no mess to clean up dinner.   Enjoy!",

I did make a few small changes.  I used a bigger piece of fish than the recipe calls for, went just a little heavier on the spices,added garlic salt, and drizzled a little bit of butter on my haddock.  And, while the recipe does not specify what kind of onion to use, I used a red onion with excellent results.  Also, I did not use capers, but instead added artichoke hearts and fresh garlic in addition to the recommended ingredients.  Lastly, I took the suggestion found in another review to place the fish on a good-sized bed of fresh spinach drizzled in olive oil before cooking, and I would also recommend this to anyone trying this recipe.  Looking forward to making this again!",

Instead of the foil packets I put 2-3 servings in a small lidded casserole and baked the whole thing together. Delicious juicy and oh-so-pretty.

I  rinsed the capers to make them a bit more mild based on some previous experience.  I used the suggestion about using a bed of spinach and the basil oil - that  was a major addition as we like spinach. My wrapped foil packages  were very large and I put them on the grill - a guy thing - outside at medium heat for 30-35 minutes .    Easy assembly and easy  cleanup and no  odor in the kitchen .  Great taste and fish was beautifully moist .  I will do this again  to showoff  for guests. Girlfriend thinks I'm a genius  !!!",
