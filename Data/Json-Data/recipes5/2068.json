I used hot smoked sausage threw in a dash of garlic some cayenne and some chilies for extra spice as well as 2 cups of beef stock. Otherwise I followed the recipe. At the last minute I decided to throw in some rotini so I'm glad I used extra broth. I thought this was soooooo tasty but my boyfriend said it was \"missing something\". Next time I'll try it with the garbanzo beans I think they would've been better. Either way I loved it. This is a very flexible recipe and even though it doesn't look like a lot of food it's very filling.:)",

I added two cups of beef stock since I cooked it on the stove to prevent it from being too thick. I will make this again. It was super easy and quick and my family LOVED it!",
