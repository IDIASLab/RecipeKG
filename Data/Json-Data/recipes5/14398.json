Buttermilk is not something I keep on hand but it is so simple to make your own. Fill a measuring cup just shy of a cup of milk and then add a tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and let it sit for 10-15 minutes and there you have your cup of \"buttermilk\". This was great on salad and perfect as a dipping sauce too. 5 stars all the way!",
