In the second attempt, I added a bay leaf when cooking the shallots (removed when serving) and added 1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper, 1/8 tsp. ground sage, and 1/2 tsp. dried oregano. I also used Kerigold butter and heavy whipping cream instead of half-n-half. These changes weren't necessary, but I was trying to dress it up for an event. Also looks great served with a dollop of creme fraiche.",
