Also, I did not bak it but browned it then with some chicken broth, I stirrred the little bits from the pan and simmered for about an hour..You can also add white wine ( or my favourite - sherry )to taste to the sauce as it reduces while cooking.  Cover for first 45 min and uncover to let sauce reduce for last 15....much more savory than just baking.",

I felt it was overpowering with the other really fantastic flavors in this recipe. Definitely a keeper. 5 out of 5 stars. Thanks for the great recipe! I will put it on our rotation.
