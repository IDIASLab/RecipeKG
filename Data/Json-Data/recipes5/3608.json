The ingredient list seemed sort of bland and I thought it may be lacking in something. But no, it wasn't really lacking in anything. The flavor was excellent. I did take advice from some of the other reviewers and let the fish sit in the marinate for a full 8 hours. I used a ziploc bag so I could get all the air out and the swordfish filets seemed to absorb more of the flavor that way. I think this would work with just about any type of fish you'd like. It's going in my archives for future use... Thanks for this nice surprise of a recipe!",

Take a few minutes to mix up the marinade and throw it in the fridge.  Oh look, you used white wine in the marinade!  What a coincidence - you cracked a bottle of wine for the food and now have an hour to kill!\n\nWhen it's finally time to cook the steaks, it'll only take 10min on high heat for them to come out perfectly.  Turn them slightly half way through each side to get that nice crosshatch marking from the grill.  And throw in some frozen veggies for a great side.\n\nNow you've had an hour over some nice white wine and are eating phenomenal swordfish.",
