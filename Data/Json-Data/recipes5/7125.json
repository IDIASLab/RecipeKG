I also didn't bother to take the eggs out of the fridge and I used regular butter rather than clarified and as another reviewer mentioned I added a teaspoon of sugar. Definitely our favorite Dutch baby recipe so far -- I make a brown-butter icing (brown butter confectioners' sugar vanilla and milk) to go on top and it's so yummy!",
