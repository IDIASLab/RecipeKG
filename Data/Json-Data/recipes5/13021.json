I replaced the cream of chicken with cream of shrimp (but my husband and I agreed that cream of celery or cream of onion would be good also). Instead of the noodles I prepared some stove top stuffing and placed it on the bottom of the dish (sprayed with Pam first). I added some minced garlic and finely diced onion (saut\u00e9ed in butter until translucent). I added some shredded zucchini (but we thought peas broccoli cauliflower eggplant parsnip or turnip would be great too we like to \"hide\" veggies in dishes like this because my father-in-law and kids are \"veggie-phobic\" ). I'm from New England so I also added a few TBL of Old Bay and I added 4 oz cream cheese diced into the soup and crab mixture. It was really good. I also topped it with some French's Fried Onions and fresh chives for a pop of freshness at the end. Thank you! It was yummy and we'll make it again adjusting until it's just right!",
