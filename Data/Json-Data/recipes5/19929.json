The corned beef was fine but I could have achieve the same results with a more basic, conventional treatment. The carrots were candied - which is OK. And the potatoes were fine - probably too dense to take on the flavors. But the cabbage was ruined. It tasted waaaay too sweet and had none of that good cabbage taste. Maybe that's a positive for those who don't like cabbage.\n\nSo next time I'll go a different route and be a bit more traditional: make the New England Corned Beef dinner I remember from my childhood. (I missed the yummy, mouth-watering smell from cooking it stove-top too. Instead I got a too sweet smell in my kitchen that lingered for hours.)",

The only trouble I had was trying to fit everything into my slow cooker, which is a large, oblong cooker. I had to put several potatoes, part of an onion and half of the cabbage in a pan on the stove. I used a little water and some of the juices from the slow cooker, which almost reached the top rim of the cooker by then. I simmered the extras on low for the last hour or so. I'm actually glad I had to cook most of the cabbage on the stove because the cabbage that was in the slow cooker cooked down to practically nothing. The carrots were the biggest surprise! They were so incredibly sweet, I was wishing I'd added more! Everyone enjoyed the meal very much!",
