                "reviewBody": "This recipe definitely has potential with a few changes. As written the zucchini is bland and very watery. I would suggest the following: 1) \"sweat\" the zucchini flesh in a fine mesh strainer by sprinkling with salt and letting sit for 20 mins to release the extra moisture. Then pat with a towel or squeeze dry before proceeding. 2) finely shred the onion and garlic otherwise it won't have time to cook through and will be crunchy and overpowering. 3) in the very least double (or even triple) the olives feta asiago pine nuts basil and oregano. These were barely detectable. 4) salt and pepper are necessary and will do wonders for bringing out the flavors. With these changes the zucchini will be transformed into a flavorful dish. I used 8\" zucchinis since that is what's usually considered \"medium\" size. As written I had to dump out the extra liquid from the zucchini after removing them from the oven. This recipe is very versatile and can be customized with your favorite seasonings. I would also suggest chopping the zucchini before \"stuffing\" it back into the shells.",
