It was super easy to make (I used a blender because we don't have a food processor) and has a delicious velvety consistency. I did use more garlic because I had extra cloves to use. I left out the black pepper per personal preference. I wasn't sure about the basil but it works. It really works. This will be a repeater in the LTH house. THANKS for the recipe!",

I generally prefer hummus to have a fairly high ratio of tahini, so found it a bit lacking in that regard as far as hummus goes, but the flavor was still very good and I liked the creativity of using sesame oil instead of tahini. This is a great spread to add to sandwiches and wraps, and I would make it again for that purpose alone. Yum!",
