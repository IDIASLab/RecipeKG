It's a nice mix of flavors.  To save time and energy, I didn't do multiple layers of each thing - I only did one of each, so there were 3 layers in total.  I put the dip right onto a charger - white on bottom, red in the middle, green on top.  It eliminated the need for the baking dish/plastic wrap thing, which sounded like it could have been a disaster.  I also didn't have time to let it sit for a while before serving, but it certainly didn't deter my guests.  This was gone by the end of the night.  It looked nice too.",

I had my qualms when reading the nearly pound and a half of cream cheese and over a third of a pound of butter.  However, the reviews below won me over, and I made it per the instructions.  It was indeed enjoyed by myself & my guests.  However, it made so much for how much a person could actually eat of it.  And I had 20 hungry people!  I think a person could cut the amount of cream cheese/butter mixture in half and use light cream cheese to make this more of a snack food of which people could go back for more.",
