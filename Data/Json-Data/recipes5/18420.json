I added my apples to the syrup while it was cooking the apples softened and the syrup thickened just fine. I made my bread into french toast just for the fun of it and topped it with red hots to make it even prettier. The recipe didn't say what to do with the brown sugar so I didn't use it making this the perfect breakfast for Mom.She thought she was getting a sugary sweet treat when in fact it was a good tasting good for you meal.Not often I can get one by that ole girl. She only got 2 red hots on her toast being as they are all sugar.",
