I used 2 sweet italian sausages and 2 hot italian sausages I often mix them in recipes. Also I used 2 chicken breasts partially cooked then cut tiny. I had everything else in the slow cooker on high until I put the meat in. Then I put everything in at the same time and let it slow cook for 5hr - my whole place smelled so good all day and everyone was eager for supper that night!! This didn't disappoint anyone - we served over white rice cooked with beef broth. Loved it!!",

Definitely a great chicken variation of chili that many people have never tried.",

I also added a diced sweet red pepper and a diced zuchinni to amp up the veggies... this was a very tasty chili and we loved it. I love to use leaner meats and try to use them instead of beef and pork. You do not miss out on any flavor here with the leaner chicken and turkey meats.
