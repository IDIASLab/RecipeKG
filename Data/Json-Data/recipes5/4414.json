I hadn't put the meatballs in the slow cooker yet so I put them in the oven for 15mins then added to slow cooker with a jar of pasta sauce instead. I browned the sausage in a pan and added to slowcooker cooked on HIGH for 60mins. I was really hoping to salvage this and make a meal but NO! The meatballs were very DRY...I don't think it had anything to do with me popping them in the oven either. When I'm in a hurry I use a Parm Meatball recipe that you bake and they always turn out great. I would advise to just skip this recipe all together.",
