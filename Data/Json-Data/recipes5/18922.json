Given the amount of meat called for I found the amount of liquid to be added in the recipe to be insufficient. To remedy that I added a 28 oz. can of enchilada sauce. (Another 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes would also work) The only other changes made were to add the spices while the onions were sauteeing rather than after the liquid was added to allow their flavors to bloom a little and to add about 2 oz. of chopped bittersweet chocolate which increased the depth of flavor in the base and which paired well with the overall flavor profile. A mini food processor made quick work of the chile mincing. A nice recipe.",

I didn't feel the can of chili beans added anything of special interest. I also used some chocolate. And I felt the chili was better after adding double the cumin and also some New Mexico chili powder. After getting past the sweetness and making my adjustments the chili was good. I really did like the combination of fresh chilies. It made a huge pot which is good for leftovers. I definitely will make it again with my adjustments. It is a good starting point.",

I use dried beans (about 1 1/2 cups of dried beans equals the right amount when soaked and I'll mix up pinto kidney white black etc.) and omit the sugar completely. I add about a tablespoon of cocoa powder. We make two batches at a time one in each crockpot (though we brown the meat and onions/garlic on the stove top) and one will have less chili peppers than the other in order to accomodate varying tastes. We freeze any extra and it freezes and reheats very well.",
