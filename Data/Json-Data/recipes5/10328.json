I think many people are perhaps not understanding that pot roast is pot roast. It is not roast beef, it doesn't get cooked med rare, or med, etc. It gets cooked until it is sooo cooked that it falls apart. Roast beef is cooked to one's taste as rare, med rare, med. It is then sliced & usually served with au jus. Pot roast is pot roast, roast beef is roast beef, they are two different entities, period. Also, adding cups of beef stock and red wine to cover the roast is simply boiling the meat. If that's the way one decides to cook it, one prob shouldn't even bother with a mirepoix or browning the roast, etc. That said, I LOVE the simplicity of this recipe. Delicious, tender and easy to prepare. Yum.",

I'm used to using quite a bit of liquid, so I wasn't too sure about this.  Delicious!!!!  I made a couple of minor adjustments...seasoned the meat with seasoning salt and Monterey Steak for flavor.  Added sweet potato chunks and whole \"new potatoes\" to the veggies. (I had a 2 lb roast so there was plenty of room).  Threw two whole cloves of garlic on top of the meat.  The veggies melted together into the most sensational \"mush\", it was heavenly....the meat was juicy and tender.  Definately deserves 5 stars!",

I also couldn't figure out the meat as i am in New Zealand and we use different names but i used a cheapish meat.  I don't think i could say it has heaps of flavour but a nice easy dish.  I had it reheated the next day and i think it tasted even better!  I had the leftovers with horseraddish and gravy which was lovely.  I'm also going to make yorkshire puddings which i think will go well with this.  I will deffinetly make this again, maybe with less rosemary!  Loved being able to watch the video too, your drawings were awesome! :-)  Thanks",

After baking, I used the pan juices to make a small amount of pan gravy. This was good but I really missed the addition of garlic. When I make this again, I'll add garlic.",

This had over 30 positive ratings, though, so I tried it. It really worked. The moisture in the vegetables was enough to cook the meat perfectly without boiling it. I served it just like in the video and my husband and I loved it.  The next day I removed most of the chilled solid fat from the surface, chopped up the remaining meat, and stirred some canned tomatoes and beef broth in with the meat and softened vegetables to make a thick and satisfying soup. This is my new go-to pot roast. Thank you, Chef John!",
