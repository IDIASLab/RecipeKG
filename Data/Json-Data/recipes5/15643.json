Sure to be a hit, you can adjust the spice as needed by using varying levels of jalapenos and RO*TEL&reg; varieties. Top with shredded sharp Cheddar cheese and/or sour cream.

I will make it again. The only thing I will add as a personal note - it is more of a chili than a soup in my opinion. And next time I would like to add celantro as a garnish as well. I think it would be great used in making nachos with melted cheese in the oven!! I will do that in the future too. Thanks for the great recipe. (I do not review a lot of recipes but I use this site constantly. I would just like to say that please chef's stop rating a recipe based on how you changed it up. Make it first and than if you think it is soooo wonderful submit it as a new recipe. This is getting out of hand on this site. And I have noticed a lot of other comments like this. It is in fact changing up the whole \"feeling\" of how this site started) Thanks!!",

I did not use the chili sauce or jalepenos as my salsa was a medium salsa and warm enough on it's own. I used Bud Light beer. I did saute the onion bell peppers and a ton of garlic in EVOO before adding it to the crockpot. This cooked overnight and was ready to go this morning. It turned out very well.",

I used a smoked beef sausage link cut up instead of the pork sausage and a Corona instead of the dark beer. I was so worried about the beer taste that I used only about 2/3 of a bottle and added about a cup of water. Well it has been cooking for 5 hours and I have had two bowls already. It's very filling and the layers of flavor are amazing and come through in every bite. This is a true TexMex style dish. Thanks for sharing!",

I found it bland even after adding an additional 1/2 packet of taco seasoning 2 t. garlic 1t. cumin and 2 t. cilantro. The beer did NOT enhance the soup at all. Am looking for another Taco Soup recipe!",
