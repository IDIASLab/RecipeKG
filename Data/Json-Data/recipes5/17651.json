I adjusted the recipe based on reviews others had given. Some said it was too sweet, so I used one tablespoon of brown sugar to three tablespoons of jam (I used seedless boysenberry preserves). Some complained that it was too watery, so I used one tablespoon of tomato paste in place of the tomato sauce. I also used a habenero hot sauce. I agree that the quantity was small, so if you are serving more than two people, or want leftovers, adjust accordingly.\nI drizzled the sauce over Medallions of Venison Tenderloin (cooked rare/medium rare)served with garlic mashed potatoes and a good Cab for a true gourmet meal that was as good if not better than venison I've had at the fanciest restaurants. I would be proud to serve this to my most discerning guests. For leftovers to die for, try my \u201cfancy cheese steaks\u201d: spread sauce on a baguette, slice your leftover meat as thin as possible and top with caramelized onions (optional) and blue cheese crumbles.",

I am fortunate to have some homemade raspberry jam in my refrigerator.  The combination of flavors is out of this world.  This sauce is tangy, complex and complements everythig.  I mean, we put it on our steaks,  potatoes, grilled onions....Bernard, you have created a masterpiece.  Thank you.  I will be making this again and again and again.  This deserves 10 stars!

Have also used ketchup in place of tomato sauce - works equally well. Recipe is very forgiving so you can spice/sweeten up or down, try different jams, have fun experimenting to your taste as other reviewers have obviously done. My favorite use is on country fried steak (cube steak coated with bread crumbs and fried - also goes great with cubed pork steak), accompanied by a side of roasted rosemary red potatoes (wash and chop red potatoes into bite sized pieces, coat lightly with olive or vegetable oil, sprinkle with crushed rosemary and bake for about 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven). Entire meal takes less than 30 minutes.",

So the next time I made this I used slightly less and I also doubled the recipe and added 1/4 cup frozen raspberries (melted and mashed up). It tasted extra sweet but I love that. If really sweet sauce isn't your thing then don't do what I did. But using a little less worcestershire sauce would help either way.",

It simply depends on how long you boil it. That will reduce the liquidity of it, and I left mine on for too long (taking heed of other reviews!). I think 10-12 minutes of boiling is pretty good; once it cools, it thickens, so beware.\n\nAlso, my only gripe is similar to others, in that it wsa rather sweet. I will probable remove a tad of sugar from it next time. (Disclaimer: less sugar will make it more watery based on equal boiling times. Less carmelization)",
