I made the sauce according to this recipe with 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup of mayo. Those measurements are WAY off. It should probably use only a few tablespoons of milk as the picture looks like it should be a dressing consistency. By the time I added enough mayo ranch dressing mix and salsa to get the right consistency and flavor I had over 2 cups of sauce. I recommend mixing the mayo salsa and ranch dressing mix first then add a little milk at a time until you get the desired consistency. Other than that the kids and I loved it.",
