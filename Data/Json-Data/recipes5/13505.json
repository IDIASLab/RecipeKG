I say this because this is pretty much the same way I make them.\nI have grown up in MD and it kills me when people say they have a recipe for a \"true MD crab cake\" and it has bread, green peppers.... blah blah blah.\nNo... that is NOT Maryland!\nBest things to remember to anyone reading this... Use FRESH, LUMP, MARYLAND BLUE CRAB, STEAMED.  If you don't have access to freshly steamed, then buy the FRESH BLUE CRAB in the plastic containers.  NOT PASTURIZED in the can!  Use only a SMALL amt of bread crumbs and NEVER... I mean NEVER press and \"smoosh\" together to make a \"patty\".  FOLD crab LIGHTLY AND GENTLY to combine with other ingredients then form into an \"airy\", \"half-sphere\" type form.  And \"baking\" is a must.  Forget FRY!  Also, Definitely chill in the refrigerator AT LEAST 1/2 hour prior to trying to bake them.  It REALLY makes a difference when it comes to holding together.  I do use REAL EGG.  Also... never make a FLAT crab cake.  They should be large, rounded and fluffy!  Keeping this in mind... This recipe won't give you 12 cakes!\nThough using certain ingredients such as real butter and real mayonnaise may make them \"less healthy\"... it DOES make a difference in the taste.  Oh... and NEVER use real mustard.... it has to be the powdered mustard!\nGood luck and enjoy!",

I put them on a cookie sheet with foil and sprayed some butter flavored cooking spray on it and put them on top. I didn't add enough egg because they were falling apart a lot.. I only added one egg (cause I didn't have any egg substitute). So next time I'll use another half of an egg or a second egg. I also used mustard instead of mustard powder because I didn't have that. Next time I will also try other reviewer's suggestions on refrigerating the cakes for a half hour before baking them to help them hold their shape. I also baked them for 10 minutes on each side.
