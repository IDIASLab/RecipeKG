A couple of things...first of all it's very salty- don't add the total amount of salt suggested, 1 T, if any additional at all. I added half that amount and it was too much. I also cut every spice in half and that was enough for me. I thought it tasted highly spiced and very complex with half the spices. I'd suggest starting with half and then adding more if you think it needs it and with the salt just leaving it out till you taste it. \n\nI used yellow split peas, I thought the color would be a bit more appetizing. I also presoaked the peas and still ended up cooking the soup over twice as long as the recipe called for to get the peas to be tender enough.\n\nThis recipe sounds a bit farfetched but really, if you have adventurous tastebuds try it, it's worth the effort.",

Texture creamy and smooth.\n\nI simplified as follows:\n\nRecalculated servings to 6; \n\nThen substituted:\n\n2 packs of True Lemon Crystalized Lemon for the juice. \nDidn't have any lemons /lemon juice. (This is a great product, by the way, keeps a long time on the self, all natural, no added anything, just powdered, crystalized lemon, also comes in lime.)\n\n3 cups Low Sodium Chicken Broth for water and bouillon. ( Don't need or want a bunch of salt.)\n\nReduced: Salt to 1/2 tsp.\n\nReduced: Fresh Ground Black Pepper to 1/2 tsp. (Fresh ground is more potent. Didn't want to overwhelm the other flavors.\n\nPut everything in a 4 qt Crock Pot on High for 3 hrs.\n\nTook imersion blender and blended the whole soup up in the Crock Pot when cooking time was done.\n\nFantastic Texture and Flavour! Thanks so much for this recipe. A definate keeper!\n\nServed with BLT's! (I use fake, soy bacon by Gardenburger)",

I used a whole 16oz bag of peas because after 2 cups there was only about 1/4 left. It turned out awesome....Everyone loved it! I've already passed on my revision of the recipe to 3 people.",
