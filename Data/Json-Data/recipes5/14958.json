Based on the other reviews, I used more garlic than the recipe called for.\n\nI was only making this for 2 people, so I used one head of garlic and one pound of russet potatoes. \n\nI used seasoned salt and sea salt, then mashed the potatoes with the garlic, milk to desired consistency, and butter to taste (2-3 tbl).  Something was still missing.\n\nI added 4 tbl of sour cream.  They tasted just like the garlic mashed potatoes that I have had in 5 star restaurants.\n\nI served this with the Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Mignon w/Port Wine Sauce from this site (submitted by HebeGebe), a caeser salad, and a bottle of Stag's Leap 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nAmazing!",

I just squeezed it out into an air-tight containter and kept it covered, on the countertop for a few hours.  I used a mix of Yukon Gold and Red potatoes.  (I just don't like russet).  I also didn't measure the milk; just did it until it seemed right.  The garlic flavor really mellows out when it's roasted, so next time, I might even add more garlic.  Crazy, I know!  I might incorporate the roasted garlic part of this recipe into my fave taters from this site, Slow Cooker Mashed Potatoes.  Served with Roast Sticky Chicken from this site.  Sooo good!",

Not EVEN comparing apples and apples. The garlic flavor is pronounced but mellowed out by roasting, mild and pleasantly nutty. There is a big reward for taking this extra step.  The biggest problem or effort is simply that of planning ahead.  I roasted my garlic early on in the day, then just left it in the aluminum foil until I was ready for it.  I stuck strictly with butter, no olive oil,  and probably double the amount of garlic, but this recipe's submitter has Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes down pat. This is the stuff you'd expect to find in the finest steakhouses.",
