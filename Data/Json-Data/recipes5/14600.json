I did make a couple of alterations to the recipe, I roasted the tomatillos, poblano, and jalapeno in my air fryer, peeled the skins off the poblano and jalapeno before blending with the rest of the salsa verde ingredients, and as I like my foods to have a little bit of spice, I left the seeds in the jalapeno.  I also used chicken thighs instead of breast, I can throw  them in the IP whole and after 20 minutes they shred very easy right within the soup.  Will definitly make this again when the weather is chilly or just because it's delicious and what I'm wanting",
