I followed it with the following exceptions: \nI used Anaheim pepper, and liked that it was sauteed with the onion before adding the meat. I used some crushed tomatoes, chicken stock & some flour at the end to coat and thicken it up.\nI also pretty much doubled the salsa recipe and added a mango (finely chopped) and a touch of sugar & white wine vinegar. We added remaining chopped Anaheim peppers, scallion and shredded lettuce on top. The salsa also went really well with green Tabasco (my favorite).\nIt was phenomenal! With a pound of pork and doubling the salsa, it was just the right amount for our hungry family of 4. \nWe'll be making this again for sure.",

Definitely be patient and let the onions and peppers cook thoroughly until slightly charred. It s worth it!",

I've done this more then 5 times already and it ALWAYS comes out tasting amazing. It's easy, but it does take a few extra steps like when making the salsa and crema, but it's always worth it! One thing though is I prefer the salsa with MANGO instead of kiwi. And I use CUBANELLE peppers instead of poblano. Everything else stays the same. Lastly, I assume the Mexican seasoning is like taco seasoning? So I just use a packet of taco seasoning. Sooooo delicious!",

We are big fans of tacos al pastor and I wasn't sure we'd like these ground pork tacos as much ; yet we really enjoyed them.  They are just different enought and hold their own with a variety of accompaniments. I didn't have kiwis in the house, but I made a tomato salsa that was simple but refreshing.    We're not fans of the creama, so I substituted with a homemade queso fresco and cilantro dip instead.   The important point is that the basic taco filling is a very good one and it is capable of being personalized with the salsas and accompaniments of your choice.",
