The reason is very obvious: you NEVER use canned garbanzos to make falafel. That should really be common knowledge by now. Canned garbanzos are pre-cooked, which denaturizes the starch, which will make it very difficult to make them hold together. You'll have to add a ton of extra ingredients like bread crumbs, egg etc.\nThe authentic way to make falafel, and the only way to make them so they actually hold together without adding all the extra stuff, is to use dried uncooked garbanzos and soak them over night.",

I tried it after making a number of modifications based on other reviews. First, Don't use canned garbanzo by all means! use dried ones after soaking them in water overnight. Second, there is no need for olive oil in the dough at all, it will make it very runny and you already have enough oil during frying ! Third, use fresh garlic and parsley if available. I used curry as specified but I didn't like it that much and I will be sticking to the traditional spices next time(cumin and dried coriander). Overall it wasn't that bad but not that wow.",

For those like me who know that falafel does not take curry at all the two ingredients you actually need to use to replace that are ground cumin and ground coriander seeds start with 1/4 tsp. each and work up from your own taste. Finally a key to making this healthier if you wish: replace the bread crumbs with oats (yep)and work in the egg until you know you have the right consistency. You can add a little bit of water if it is too dry as the oats will soak it up and you will have no splatter at the fry stage. Just keep in mind that if you make these with oats it fries differently and some of the crispiness may be lacking. Why I gave it 4 stars? I love falafel and this is a good general idea of where to start!",
