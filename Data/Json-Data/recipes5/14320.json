The salad is just as good without red pepper for those with discerning palates. Also as an alternative, a favorite hot sauce can be substituted for the red pepper with each individual serving. I like to add a dash of Louisiana-style cayenne pepper sauce to mine.",

Didn't have a tomatillo added salt and black pepper but otherwise kept to the recipe; except didn't use red pepper flakes since I was serving it along side a spicy Cajun Chicken recipe. Wanted this to be a fresh cooling element along side the main and not another source of spice. Worked excellent for that. That's a meal I'll make often.",
