I add 1 c. uncooked rice and 2 c. water in a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and microwave for around 20 mins.  Also, I steam the broccoli.  You can also use 2 pkgs of frozen broccoli to save cook time.  The recipe takes a while to make, but it is worth it.  You can also make it the day ahead of time and bake in the oven when you are ready to eat.  It might need a little longer to bake if its chilled all the way through.  Enjoy!",

I used brown rice and used less cheese than what the recipe called for.  Turned out wonderful! This reminds me of a recipe my grandma used to make for us, but a LOT healthier version of it:)",

I made it as written except for using 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar and 1/2 cup of slivered almonds (that's how they're pkgd-didn't want to save small amounts). Flavors are subtle...esp loved the curry! I may try it without almonds next time. Even though I added a little extra think I'd like to try it without the crunchiness of the almonds (just a texture thing-can't tell if they impacted the overall taste of the dish). 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts is the perfect amount for this recipe if you're wondering. I boiled then cubed them. Thanks for the yummy recipe-it's a keeper!",
