The lemon (which I've never seen in Kung Pao chicken) was way too overpowering.  It doesn't belong at all.  The recipe states it's not \"as spicy\" as other versions. Well it's not spicy *at all* - there are no spicy ingredients in this recipe. I added some crushed red pepper  on top for a bit of heat.  There is also a lot of ground ginger, so you'll probably want to cut back on that. I halved it, and that was plenty. On the plus side, the cook time is spot on.",
