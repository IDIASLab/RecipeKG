Seeing the prior comments about its being watery and too much batter, I went with it adding an egg yoke, half cup of heavy cream, +   1 cup chopped baby spinach, and 1/2 cup of both  chopped onions and mushrooms. Ladeled the batter in to about 1/3 inch below the top of the pie crust as there was almost enough for two  pies. (I cheated with pre-made sourdough pie crust.  Luckily I bought two.) So good!",
