This is exactly the recipe I remember - the only difference is that she used walnuts and raisins too. Bless you for posting it. For anyone wondering what it tastes like - it's dense and moist without being heavy or greasy. You wouldn't think of it as a chocolate cake unless you saw the recipe. In my family the recipe goes back to at least 1890. It may be older than that. Grammy always made this at Christmas time and frosted it with seven minute boiled frosting and silver dragees so it looked like drifted snow. Made a day or two ahead and covered well it won't dry out or lose flavor.",
