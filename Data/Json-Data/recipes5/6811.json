I may have had a can of large water chestnuts, so I did halve the slices.  I had just enough Mexican 4-Cheese Blend on hand, so I made a substitution there, otherwise, followed the recipe.  The casserole has a nice \"crunch\" from the water chestnuts and celery, and that cheese and little bit of French fried onions was just the perfect topping.   I will try cutting back the mayonnaise a bit next time in an effort to reduce calories and fat (this is an indulgence for the way I eat) because I'm not convinced that you really need a full cup of mayo.   The one comment I would make relates to the number of servings.  I don't think we're really big-portion eaters, but this is six servings for us, not eight...but that's just a personal comment.  We enjoyed this, and it definitely will be made again (probably with leftover turkey from the not-to-distance Holidays).",

I should have known better and just added them the last 5 minutes. I had to pick burnt onions off the top of my dish. I agree with other reviewers that one cup mayo is too much. I halved it. I also added garlic powder, basil, and smoked paprika. I sprayed my casserole dish with Pam. I liked the crunch that the almonds and chestnuts gave the dish. I will make it again, with a few adjustments.",

I only made a few changes to suit our tastes. First I probably had closer to 2 1/2 cups of chicken because I used both greats off of a salt-free rotisserie chicken. I added 2 minced garlic cloves bumped the black pepper to 1/2 tspn used light mayo and knocked the salt back a bit. I also forgot the almonds (realized they were still sitting on the counter after the casserole had been baking for 10 minutes) but will try them in next time. Mixed everything well in a large bowl before spreading into the baking dish. Baked for 35 minutes and served alongside steamed broccoli and brown rice. It was super tasty husband loved it and requested it again soon and I especially liked the crunch the celery and water chestnuts gave. Even with the extra chicken this was closer to 5-6 servings for us.",
