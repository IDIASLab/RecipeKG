We had baked a chicken and shredded for enchiladas the next night but didn't know what to do with it the original night.  Used this recipe as a starter and just used what we had in the house.  Chicken flavored rice made in the microwave.  Cored and cut up an apple.  We had dried Cranberries, Craisens.  Once the rice was ready, since the chicken was already cooked and shredded, I mixed it along with the Cranberries and apples into the rice.  It was really good! But for our second helping I added in some slivered almonds as well to give it some crunch and this made it even better. Quick, inexpensive, easy and delicious! Thanks for a new dinner we will continue to make!",
