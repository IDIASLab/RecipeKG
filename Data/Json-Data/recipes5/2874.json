But it sure is VERY GOOD QUICK and EASY. I will definitely make again and again. The consistency and the amount of lemon is perfect to us. My suggestions: don't use a real cheap or instant rice (I like Riceland's Extra Long Grain) use FRESH-squeezed lemon juice 1%(or creamier) milk and add lots of fresh cracked pepper. I served with french rolls with honey-butter(recipe from this site). Great creamy quick hearty (although lacking-in-veggies) meal. For more novice cooks;add the rice and the lemon juice JUST BEFORE SERVING. I appreciate your sharing this recipe Lyndsey thank you. Dyann",

Just remember to have something else to serve on hand. (A nice Greek salad hummus and crackers and fresh pears drizzled with honey keeps with the theme well.)",
