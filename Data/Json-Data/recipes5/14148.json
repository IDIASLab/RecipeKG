Used one white onion, 3 stalks of celery, a fresh serrano pepper minced (with seeds left in tact), a green pepper, added dried: cilantro, thyme, oregano, paprika, garlic granules, a dash of cinnamon, salt & pepper.  I also used a small amount of agave syrup to mellow out the tomato acidity.  Then I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes, a can of tomato paste & sauce & a can of chicken broth.  For the beans I used 2 cans of great northern white beans, drained.  I omitted the o.j., but we LOVED the addition of the tequila!!  It's subtle, but you can taste it in the background -- yummy!!!\n\nThanks for posting this recipe :)",

I used fresh jalapeno instead of red pepper flakes and sauteed them with the onion & celery. 2. I added more chili powder plus used cumin coriander and cayenne pepper. 3. I omitted the orange juice. Other reviewers have said that this lends a nice flavor but I don't think orange juice has any place in chili. The end result was quite tasty. I didn't even need to add sour cream to my bowl (a chili staple). In fact the sour cream ruined it for me which is testimony to how tasty this chili is on its own. My only complaint is that it was too runny. Next time I will pull back on the sauce or add more meat. Otherwise this is definitely a keeper and I will make it again.",
