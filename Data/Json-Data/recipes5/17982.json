I researched several BBQ recipes online and in my cookbooks and combined bits and pieces of different things I liked about them. The result was a wonderful and tangy loose BBQ for sandwiches that is very easy to make and takes little hands-on time. My in-laws who are in their 70s both said it was the best BBQ they had ever had. It was awesome!",

I used only a 2.75 lb. roast, and after 5 hours it was JUST getting to the point of being able to easily shred.  The taste though is divine!  I halved the recipe (since I was using a smaller roast), added a packet of Onion Soup Mix (per others reviews, thought this was a good addition) and added a quartered whole onion while it cooked.  After the meat was done, I took out the 1/2 cup of broth, and then put the rest in a saucepot.  I then added to the broth pot all the ingredients and brought to a slow boil for a couple of minutes, then added everything (meat and sauce) back to the crockpot for another 4 hours on low.  Because I was running low on ketchup, and based on the reviews, I only used 1/4 cup ketchup and 1 1/4 cups Hickory Smoke Kraft BBQ sauce (for full recipe, I'd use 1/2 cup ketchup and 2 1/2 cups BBQ Sauce).  I did not use the additional salt because of the soup mix, and I used maybe 6 shakes (12 for full recipe) of Tabasco in place of the cayenne.  This recipe tastes authentic and it's addictive!  Served with cornbread.  (Sorry, I think this is the longest review ever!)",

I also scaled the recipe to 8 servings because I happened to have a 2 lb chuck roast on hand. I cooked the meat the afternoon/evening before. Shredded and assembled the recipe before bed and put it and the broth in the fridge overnight. At two the next afternoon I continued with the recipe. I did have to use most of the broth (the good thing was by chilling it I was able to remove all the fat). I served it with jalapeno slices sliced onions that were broiled slightly to take the bite out and coleslaw as optional toppings on toasted (broiled) french bread. My husband had been dreading this roast yet absolutely loved this recipe - even had a second sandwich. I would have given 5 stars but because I think it was the Mesquite ketchup that made it so good only gave it 4.",

                "reviewBody": "Had a chuck roast (3.5 lbs) thawed, so I threw it in the crockpot this AM covered with beef broth. Have definitely never heard of 7 lbs. of any cut of roast shredding after 2-4 hours in a crockpot on low (!!!), so I just planned on the standard 7-8 hours. Was fork tender/shredded easily at that point, so I drained some of the liquid out and made the sauce in a *separate* pan - those of you who don't like the taste, this is a good sauce base, but get creative and tweak it to your own preferences. More vinegar, add some other spices, more worcestershire, spice it up with crushed red pepper, honey vs. brown sugar, etc. (which is a good reason to make the sauce in a separate pan!). You really can't mess this up! After the sauce was done, I added it to the beef and cooked on low for another hour and it was perfect! Served on bakery-fresh toasted buns with homemade garlic cole slaw on the sandwiches (cole slaw on top of the bbq and under the top bun is essential in the south!) and thick cut oven fries. EXCELLENT and the kids tore it up! Regarding the sauce, for us it's kicked up with crushed red pepper, yellow mustard vs. dried, apple cider vinegar vs. white, a little juice from a jar of pepperocini peppers, and lots of McCormick Smokehouse ground black pepper. Just follow the base, and if it's not quite \"there\" for you, keep adding and tasting until you love it, THEN toss with the beef & it's the perfect (indoor anyway!) BBQ beef for sandwiches. Thanks for the great recipe!",
