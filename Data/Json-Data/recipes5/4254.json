There was a slight bitterness although we used a quality riesling as well. We'll use the leftover marinade as a salad dressing with a veggie/fruit salad but wouldn't make it again.",

I figured they were fairly similar in texture & juiciness... Anyway it was WONDERFUL!!! Everyone raved. Oh! I did add extra garlic cloves because we are garlic freaks. Was actually looking for something lower in salt for a marinade. Everything else called for either teriyaki sauce or added salt. This was the best one I could find. Will definitely use this one again!",
