I know that the recipe says to let it set in the fridge overnight but I went ahead and had a little right away but I'm sure it'll taste better tomorrow. I left out the mint because I just really don't like that and I substituted about a tablespoon of green onion instead of regular onion (I didn't want to cut up an entire onion just for 1TB)... It is fantastic! the only thing I'm going to change next time is a smidge less lemon juice -- that actually is taking over a bit. I do have one question though -- the recipe says 6 servings -- how much is a serving?",
