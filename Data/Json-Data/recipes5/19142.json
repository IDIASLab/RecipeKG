This tastes like a pumpkin pie if I had to compare it to something. Very tasty! I used 1tsp of cinnamon and.5tsp nutmeg for the apple pie spice. I also used evaporated milk instead of cream and it turned out fine. Mashing the squash was good enough I avoid pureeing whenever possible. Nice to see good squash recipes listed. Thanks!",

I use condensed milk instead of cream and white sugar instead of brown. It's creamier than pumpkin which makes it better:)",

I followed the recipe as stated. Not being very much into sweets myself I was happy with the low sugar content of the pies so I knew they'd be fine for anyone on a low sugar diet (ie grandma). However I am in the South and \"WE LOVE OUR SWEETS\" so the second time I made them for the \"not so low sugar crowd\" I put in 2 cups of dark brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar. What a crowd pleaser! Great recipe it's really a 2 in 1 recipe! Thanks",

This is the first pie I've made from a \"raw\" squash always having used canned pumpkin before. I was happy with the result. Flavor and texture were fine (although the pies cracked -- like a cheescake. My \"reservations\" are simply that the resulting pie is really no better than with the canned stuff! Roasting the squash and extracting the pulp was not all that difficult -- but not as easy as opening a can for the same results! One change I did make was to substitute a mix of pumpkin-pie spices (cinnamon nutmeg cloves and ginger) for the called-for apple-pie spice. Although I suspect that apple-pie spice and pumpkin-pie spice are similar I just could not bring myself to use apple-pie spcies in what is essentially pumpkin pie. I don't recall any reviewers commenting on the spice -- maybe the comments are there (just didnt see 'em). I do wonder if the apple-pie spice would somehow have worked with the hubbard squash in some special way.....",

I had some buttercup squash that I had previously roasted mashed and frozen. Just grabbed a 2 cup bag of squash (thawed of course) and tossed it in the blender with the rest of the ingredients just as listed. Buttercup squash is a bit drier and finer textured than regular ol' pumpkin so this pie had a wonderful smooth texture. Also buttercup squash is sweeter than most other winter squashes and pumpkins so I stuck with the 1/2 cup sugar and it was just perfect. Anything more would have been too sweet. The apple pie spice was great in this pie rather mild and to me it really fits the late summer/early fall season. When I make this pie around Thanksgiving and Christmas I'll probably use pumpkin pie spice.",
