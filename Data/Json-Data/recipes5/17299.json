I have tried making a handfull of highly rated cocktail sauce recipes I found all over the net, but I MUST say that I preferred yours the most.  It tastes great and is EXTREMELY easy to make!  To boot it only has 4 ingredients, which everyone will most likely have on hand.  The exception is the fresh horseradish.  So, I used about 1.25 - 1.5 teaspoons of prepared white horseradish which suited my tastes just fine.  Great job, keep em coming!",
