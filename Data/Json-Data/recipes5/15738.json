The only thing I did different was pre-season the chicken tenders heavily front and back with onion powder salt (light) little pepper (lightly) and garlic powder...with exception to salt and pepper. I probably went heavier on parm cheese and bread crumbs...that is just what I like. I do this no matter what the recipe calls for because it always gives that added flavor boost and keeps it from being bland. Thank you Crystal for sharing this recipe it is different from most breaded chicken recipes delicious and easy to make!!",

Maybe it would help to skip the flour and just apply the spices and seasonings directly to the chicken dip in buttermilk and then in the seasoned crumbs/cheese mixture.

I cooked it in a frying pan in the oven instead of a rack and the bottom was very brown and crispy; delicious!! The first time I added the optional salt but it was too salty so second time no salt and it was great. I had a lot of the buttermilk left over so next time I will try just a half a cup instead of whole cup. Adding this to my menu rotation!",
