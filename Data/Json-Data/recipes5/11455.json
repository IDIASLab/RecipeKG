Such a refreshing change from all the recipes whose overuse of sugar masks the nice flavors of the other ingredients. This pie is not sweet enough to qualify as \"dessert\" for lots of folks but for me it's quite sweet enough and is a very nice way to eat sweet potatoes. For those wondering how much fresh sweet potato will yield the 2 cups of mash needed for each pie we found that baking about 1 1/4 pound of potatoes per pie was about right. Bake in a covered dish with the skins on let them cool peel and mash. We made a whole wheat pastry flour and lard crust that makes this pie a yummy earthy meal in itself.",
