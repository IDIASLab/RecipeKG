The texture really is quite different, both with the runnier egg and with the Japanese rice.  \n\nAlso, dashi is a light, delicious broth made from kombu (kelp) and katsuobushi (flakes of dried bonito).  It's very easy to make. You can get the ingredients, or dashi powder, at any Asian market or in the international aisle of high-end grocery stores. Dashi is NOT powdered little dried fish!",

Compared to those recipes provided by native Japanese home cooks on allrecipes.jp this is a pretty nice recipe. I'd like to share how my Oyakodon turned out for those of who do not have all the ingredients written here. I used 6 pieces of chicken breast tenders 1/2 onion 2cups chicken stock 1/4cup soy sauce 3 tbsp red wine 3 tbsp brown sugar 4 eggs. The sauce wasn't thick enough and I thought it was too much soy sauce. Wish I had Mirin. Although I didn't like it much my American boyfriend loved it. I'd love to try this again with the original ingredients and also with breaded chicken cutlet (Chicken Katsudon)",
