I am a big fan of paella and wanted to try it, but couldn't find a recipe. This is my version of fideua. It turned out awesome and a lot faster to cook than paella. I made mine in a 10\" cast iron skillet, and made enough to feed about 4 peeps.",

I couldn't find frozen artichoke hearts and thought using canned might be too mushy...plus they weren't in the dish I had but peas were so I added those instead. This is a very tasty recipe and close to the real thing. I think using the cast iron skillet and sticking it in the oven would add the final touch. Will make this again.",
