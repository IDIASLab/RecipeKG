All I added to this marinade was a little dry white wine and I did cut the brown sugar way back to 1 tsp. because I really wanted the garlic and herb flavor to come through vs. a sweet flavor. But I still wanted to stick to the recipe. I skewered the shrimp onto bamboo skewers and marinated it for a couple hours. It turned out so good - I would definitely make this again!",

This is a matter of personal taste, and I'm sure others would love the extra sweetness. Also, running short of time, I only marinated the shrimp for an hour, and it turned out to be a happy mistake. The seasoning was just right, and had it marinated any longer I think it would have been too strong, overpowering the taste of the shrimp. More isn't always better! Rather than the outdoor grill, we just broiled these on bamboo skewers and, once done, brushed on some melted butter for a nice glisten and richness. Served this wonderful dinner with Dill and Butter Squash and Parmesan Orzo, recipes also from this site. ",

The only changes I made were to use fresh basil, and boil the remaining marinade (with 1 T. butter) for basting on the grill.  Served with garlic butter rice, and sauteed zucchini for the most delicious meal so far this week.  I will definitely use this receipe again!",
