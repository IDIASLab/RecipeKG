It was edible but neither my son nor I liked it. It even ruined the taste of the spuds. We ended up picking out the meat and eating it over rice. I put a ton of hot sauce on mine to get it down because I couldn't stand the thought of wasting all of it. Nothing was rotten. It was the beer that did it. Too much beer flavor. I would do this again with a strong beef bullion base and maybe one bottle of beer. I would also add thyme sprigs soy sauce and celery as spices. It has potential.",
