Was afraid the almond meal would give it a slight almondy flavor but didn't notice it at all. Totally forgot to add the salt and pepper d'oh! I would have liked it with a little more zing so maybe next time I will use a spicy salt and perhaps some chopped jalapenos. But it is a very easy quick recipe to prepare. A food processor really helped to mix it up too by hand I couldn't get the tuna chunks small enough to absorb the liquid. Family of 4 ate them all up. Would make again.",

I used coconut aminos in place of the soy sauce {soy sauce is NOT paleo}. I used 3 egg whites and 2 yolks so its not so eggy tasting. I also added a shake of ground red pepper to spice it up some. I didn't have to use a processor. I just mixed it up really well and it was fine. Next time I will try adding onions! Thanks for the recipe!",
