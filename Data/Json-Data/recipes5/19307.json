Adding a few cloves of chopped fresh garlic and crushed bacon over top toward the last few minutes. Delicious. ",

So, I thought I'd learn how to steam them and came across this recipe.    I find all the ingredients in her kitchen except only seem to have pre-cooked bacon and you know the paint can is open and I can't run to the store.  So I forge ahead.  The beans must have been past their prime, 'cause I had to steam them much much longer than you guys, giving me time to prime the woodwork even.    So, it all comes together and doesn't look nearly as green as the photograph, so I guess I oversteamed them.  But boy does it taste GOOD.  Can't imagine how good it would have been if a real cook had done it.  I might even save some for my wife.  I think I've found another hobby.",
