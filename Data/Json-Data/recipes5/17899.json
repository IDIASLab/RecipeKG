Butterscotch chips tend to make things too sweet. Used 2 eggs on the advise of others. I let the dough set in the fridg and had no trouble shaping into logs. I also allowed the logs to cool compleatly before slicing and had no problems. I will make these again because they add a nice variety to a gift platter.I may use 1-2 tsp of rum extract and omit the booze and will chop the butterscotch chips next time to avoid the intense sweet taste. You can stand your cookies upright for the second baking and cut the cooking time in half. This also eliminates any chance of breakage on the turn.",

I followed the other person's suggestion to use rum and to let the batter sit in the fridge for a few minutes before shaping the loafs. I also put a layer of wax paper on the bottom of my cookie sheet and I think this made a big difference. The only thing I didn't like was that the cookies seemed a little stale by the next 24 hours and I had them in a tightly sealed container. Next time I'll just make these right before the party and not the night before. My party guests loved them!",
