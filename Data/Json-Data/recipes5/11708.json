I should have turned the pot off of saute sooner than I did because I burned some of the dumplings on the bottom once I put it back on stew. My pot said BURN so I knew to stop it cooking and check it. Thus the dish was not ruined and tasted great. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

I didn't have dumplings so I substituted grands biscuits, cooked them for about 5 minutes on saute with the stock until they were plump and slightly brown.

After making it many times I ve made some tweaks that made it just right for us - I use low sodium chicken broth instead of stock for more flavor and I use 4 cups of broth 2 cans of cream of chicken. Also turning the instant pot to saute while placing the dumplings/wonton wrappers in only causes them to clump & burn to the bottom more. I turn the instant pot off for this step put the shredded chicken back in add the sliced wonton wrappers next stir and then stew again. Delish! If you re unable to find frozen dumpling wrappers in your local store you can use wonton wrappers. I buy the fresh refrigerated pack in the produce section then slice them into thick strips similar to an egg noodle. (I still haven t managed to find dumpling wrappers at any of the 4 different chains I ve checked locally)",
