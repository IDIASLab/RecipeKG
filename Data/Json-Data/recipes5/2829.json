One small can to each 8 ounce block of cheese. I used 3 cheese to 2 milk and beat it until it was fluffy and it was delicious. The extra cheese helps to take away the excessive sweetness. I backed off a little on the lemon juice too. About 2/3 of what it calls for even though I added the extra cheese. Also the cheese should stay cool to get a fluffier pie. I took it to a dinner last night and it was a big hit.",

First she would take the graham craker crust and let it bake in the oven at 350 for 8-10 minutes and then let it cool. For those of you having trouble with it setting her recipe card calls for 1/3 cup of lemon juice not 1/2 cup. Let the cream cheese soften to room temp and whip it until fluffy then gradually add the milk and beat until well blended. Then add the vanilla and lemon juice. Chill it for at least 3 hours. Then she would add the cherry pie filling on top. I'm sure then it'll come out just like hers did. And like Grandma's always do she'd add whipped cream on top! Those were the days..........",

I baked it for eight minutes and cooled before I poured in the cheesecake filling. I used fat free cream cheese and \"free\" Cool Whip. The cheesecake was a little loose if I were to make it again I'd use half the amount of lemon juice. It was too much. I used my own low-sugar dessert topping over the top made out of Splenda lemon juice and frozen strawberries blackberries and cherries. Looks great and is a sweet way to clean out my pantry!",
