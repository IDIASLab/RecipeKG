Sadly the coffee actually overpowered any praline flavor and made it a tad bitter so I wish I would have omitted the coffee powder altogether. I also think you could double the sugar in the batter to sweeten it up a bit. I used a 9 inch square pan (I don't own a 10 inch) so I had to bake it for about 15 extra minutes. It turned out fine but the overwhelming coffee flavor wasn't our cup of tea:) Thanks so much for sharing.",
