I used a whole packet of taco seasoning (misread the recipe), green chilie enchilada sauce (I've been craving it), and omitted the chili powder.  Melting the sour cream and cheddar with the beef on the stove makes a creamy, lovely filling.  And laying the black beans and olives on top (instead of incorporating them into the filling), is genius.  The beans retain a nice little \"snap\" that hits your tounge at just the right time.  I topped my enchiladas with jack cheese.  I can't say enough good things about this dish - it's beyond delicious.",

MAKE SURE YOU USE THE WHOLE PACKET! It was soooo flavorful and we all agreed it would NOT have been nearly as flavorful if I only used 1 Tb of that. I didn't use parsley. I added almost a whole green pepper to the beef with the onion. After I pulled this out of the oven, I topped it with: chopped cilantro, green onions, tomatoes, Mexican cheese and I could not eat this without sour cream on the side! I will be making this every time I want enchiladas! Beef is so much better than chicken! Thank you!",

After the tortillas were in the pan I spooned some enchilada sauce over the tortillas and than added the cheese. It was delicious!! I had some left over meat sauce, so I added the remaining black beans and chopped olives and I will use the leftovers for nachos tomorrow night!!",

Oh, wait, another mod:  I made my own sauce from the site, \"the best red enchilada sauce.\"   So, still felt like I needed to share how great the components of this recipe are.  Really made a delicious enchilada.   I'm sure ground beef would've been great also, but I had a small party to feed.  No leftovers!!!!!",
