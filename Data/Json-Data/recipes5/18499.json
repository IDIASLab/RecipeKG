I've tried it with both brown and white sugar -- with white sugar it is a little lighter and you want about a tablespoon less of port (half a cup instead of 9 tablespoons). It's tasty both ways but a brighter color if you use white sugar and ruby port.",

                "reviewBody": "I'm giving this version 4 stars. It is good but to make it better use a tawny port bringing out the flavor of the brown sugar more and give it caramel notes. I like Cockburns' 20 Year Tawny Port. 1/2 cup is more than plenty for the port. I also found a teaspoon of McCormick's Valencia Orange Peel did quite well instead of fresh zest. In place of a fresh orange you can use 1/2 cup orange juice. Also put the ingredients other than the cranberries in the pot stir until the sugar dissolves. After rinsing the cranberries put them in the pot over medium heat. Stir periodically and be aware it will bubble up so a 2 3/4 quart pan worked best. I also found it best to let all the berries pop and this can take about an hour in the uncovered pot. This also helps burn off the alcohol but leaves the rich port flavor. Make at least one night before you want to use it.",
