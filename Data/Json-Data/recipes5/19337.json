My peaches were so juicy I had to adjust the cooking technique. After the peaches were cooked I pulled then out with a slotted spoon. I then continued to cook the syrup until it thickened. This topping would also be very good on a cream cheese stuffed French toast. I would keep the peppers at 2 if it is not being used with ice cream. Thanks Dave for the post!",

They are just dare peaches not double dare without the habaneros.  Amazing recipe!  The only tweak I would do next time would be to keep the peaches and ice cream separate on the plate so the ice cream doesn't melt and mix with the peaches.  It dulls down the kick.  Also, if serving for a big party, don't tell them that it is spicy and just watch.  Priceless!",

Besides the ice cream that helps cool it off the heat is just a little end note and doesn't overwhelm the peaches. I recommend making sure you don't dice the peppers too small. Maybe just chop them in quarters. The butter gets a little frothy and it can be hard to find the peppers to take them out. You wouldn't want someone to come across one on accident! YIKES!
