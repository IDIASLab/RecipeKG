It was surprisingly easy to make despite the fact that I was nervous about charring vegetables for the first time - also my first go with tomatillos!!! It doesn't exactly taste \"smoky\" - maybe I should leave a little more of the charred skin on next time (I wish there was a bit more technical advice in the recipe because the tomatillos charred up and became very soft so it was hard to \"scrape\" them). It also has some nice spice to it - if you like salsa's very spicy I would even dare say you could add another jalapeno or two. This recipe does not make a lot so if you are preparing it for a party I would double the recipe (let's put it this way - I could wolf down the whole thing in one sitting if I allowed myself to!!!).",

Basically I followed the recipe but instead of the 3 jalepenos I used 1 jalepeno and one poblano pepper, and cored and seeded both of them, to create a mild salsa. When roasting I put the pan on the middle rack and did not preheat, because I thought that would help the tomatillos have time to soften before burning. When one of them split open is when I removed them. I also added about 1/8th cup of chopped red onion to the blender.  WOW! I was blown away by the delicious flavor!",
