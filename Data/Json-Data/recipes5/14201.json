There is no seasoning AT ALL called for in the meatball mixture not even salt and pepper. So I took the advise of another reviewer and along with S & P I added garlic powder chile powder cumin oregano hot pepper flakes and W-sauce. I also browned the meatballs first because I don't like the idea of plopping naked raw meatballs into the sauce. The Mexican market up the road had tomatillos on sale for 50 cents a pound so I used a whole pound instead of 1/4. I reserved a cup of the tomatillo/jalapeno cooking liquid to use to make the sauce. I minced the onion garlic and cilantro in my mini-chopper added that mixture to the cookied vegetables and cooking liquid and used my immersion blender to puree the whole thing to a nice consistancy. I had some homemade beef broth in my freezer and I used that in place of the 3 cups of water. I reduced the sauce until it was nice and thick then added the meatballs olives and a diced red bell pepper(for color) and simmered it all for about 20 minutes. We really liked this dish and I'll definitely make it again when tomatillos go on sale. Thanks for the post.",

It all blends together so nicely and I was very impressed and will most definitely make this one again.",

My husband isn't an especially fussy eater but as they say \"different strokes for different folks.\" I modified the recipe by adding the optional jalapeno peppers to the meatballs and baking them in the oven since I wanted them to be brown (my husband liked those a lot). I was concerned that the soup would lose some flavor because I did cook the meatballs in the oven (instead of boiling them in the broth) so I compensated by caramelizing the onions and frying the garlic instead of adding them raw so that they would be more flavorful (probably not very authentic). One of the steps did not make sense to me: why should I drain the cooked tomatillos before putting them in the blender and then add just plain water? I just used the liquid from the cooked tomatillos as part of my water. I did not need to cook this a lot after blending it since the ingredients were all already cooked. What is REALLY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE before making this soup is that the base is a can of olives that is pureed in the blender. If you don't think you could like pureed olives as a soup base then it is not a good idea to make this soup. Thank you Melanie for sharing your recipe.",
