Also added some paprika, and garlic powder and omitted the ginger (my wife doesn't like it) It needed a good amount of salt, but its super flavorful. Also made brown rice separately in my rice cooker and just served it that way. (I hate storing sauce with rice, it absorbs all the sauce and you lose that flavor) Would def make it again. Super healthy and tasty!  Makes a great breakfast the day after",
