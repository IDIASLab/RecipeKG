To me the flavor was bland and there was no hint of sweet or sour to it. The only distinguishible flavor was the sesame oil which I would leave out if I made it again. I chose to omit mushrooms and did add a can (11 oz.) of mandarin oranges. I used kuzu (kudzu) powder instead of arrowroot and my sauce did not thicken - probably my fault. If you don't have arrowroot I would recommend going back to cornstarch. I also chose to use Jasmine rice instead of brown. I would also recommend cooking the green beans & carrots briefly in the microwave to cut down on cooking time - mine was way longer than 3-5 minutes. I probably will not make this again.",
