I added some fresh mushrooms and potatoes.It smells wonderful cooking. The stew sauce and veggies very yummy ( I still didn't like the taste of venison ). You could cut the venison with a spoon.

I also added potates and garlic. Yum, will for sure make again! I noticed on a lot of the reviews for various venison recipes several women say they don't really like the taste of vension, try soaking the meat in milk for at least 10-20 minutes, then let drain in strainer over the sink before cooking. This helps with the \"gamey\" taste. ",

It had the potatoes onions carrots celery already cut and ready to put in the crock pot. I used the golden mushroom soup as called for but used cream of chicken soup instead of cream mushroom. I used about a half can of chicken broth. I added a little bit of garlic pepper and my secret ingredient to almost everything -mild taco seasoning! Threw in crock pot in about 2 minutes before work. It was ready before I got home. Put over cornbread first day; corn chips second day. AWESOME!",
