I was very pleasantly surprised!  The flavor is much more complex that one would expect from the rather simple ingredient list.  But a warning - I read through recipe reviews on here and see people deviating from the recipe to try to \"lighten\" it up.  So - please don't try to omit the bacon and its grease!  Baco's and canola oil just isn't going to cut it.  (To be fair I should add, I deviated from the recipe and simmered this for about an extra 10 minutes - the meatloaf I had in the oven wasn't done yet and I didn't want the beans to get cold...)",

I sauted 1 diced medium onion in just a little bit of the bacon grease after the bacon was removed. Instead of the diced tomatoes I used 1/2 a can of tomato puree. I thought it had a more consistant tomato flavor than with chunks of tomato. It turned out great! I will be using this recipe frequently.",
