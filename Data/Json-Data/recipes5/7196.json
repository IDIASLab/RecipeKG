Its flavor is so unique and outside the box and will have everyone trying to guess the ingredients because its flavor is so mouth watering! Goes great with a plain or bland rice pilaf. Also fatoosh or tabbouleh salad goes well with it as a side. You'll need metal skewers or a grilling basket (I prefer the basket).",

Because I was making two different recipes and because there is only two of us I halved the recipe. I don't know what half of 1/8 teaspoon pomegranate syrup would be but it couldn't be enough to make a difference in my opinion and I sure wasn't going to buy it for that. All of the flavors came together perfectly in this. I'm typically not a fan of allspice but it totally works in this one. This one is a keeper and 5 stars all the way!",
