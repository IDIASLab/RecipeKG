I let the chicken breasts soak while I heated up the grill - about 5 minutes - then seasoned with garlic powder, seasoned salt and Italian herb seasoning. I turned the heat down to medium low and cooked them \"low and slow\" - about 6 minutes on one side, 10 minutes on the other. When I turned the breasts, I put a pat of butter on each to keep things moist. The results were outstanding. Nothing plain or run-of-the-mill about it! The ckicken was bursting with flavor - you could taste the lemon juice as well as the seasonings. The only thing I will do differently next time is double the amount of chicken cooked. My husband is disappointed there isn't more for leftovers!",
