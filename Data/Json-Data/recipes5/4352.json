What I mean by that is, with canned, a three, with fresh/frozen & fresh tomato, a four or five.  Since using canned, I didn't add water & kinda (well, did) put the entire 15oz can tomatoes in (by mistake this time!)  I freeze chipotle peppers by the T so used one of those (equivalent to the pepper & sauce) with the other ingredients except the green beans & lemon juice.  Brought to boiling then added the beans to heat & lemon juice.  'Not too chipotle-y, which can be easy to do.  I tried before & after the lemon juice & liked it better before.  'Doesn't taste lemony, but gives a slight vinegar flavor.  Anyone having a garden with green beans & tomatoes should save this recipe.  :)",
