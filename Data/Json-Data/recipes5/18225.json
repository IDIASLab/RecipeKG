NOTE: I had a 7 1/2 lb brisket, so I cut in half and put each half in a separate aluminum pan (for easy cleanup), then I mixed 2 separate batches. The first I cooked in the oven as stated, the other in a slow cooker. The oven MAKES all the difference!! The oven-cooked brisket flaked easily and absorbed all the flavor>>YUM, the slow cooker brisket had great flavor, but texture-wise was that tough-hard-to chew texture..we will stick with the oven as the recipe states..A KEEPER! Thanks! I served w/mashed potatoes, gravy & peas. Everyone from 3 yr old up to teenagers and Papa-LOVED it! Thanks!",

This is a GREAT recipe that solved my problem with tough brisket!  My mistake the first time was not to trim off the fat from my brisket....it made the sauce pretty much inedible but the meat was still wonderful!  The second go round I did not repeat my mistake, and WOW!  Tender meat, great tasting sauce, easy to make, and good enough to serve to any native Texan!  Thanks for the recipe, I will make again and again (and impress all my Texas friends)!",

I only used 3/4 the bottle of chilie sauce and 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar. I used most of the bottle of beer, I only left one gulp left! ;) I read all of the tips that were provided by others and I followed all of the cooking directions. After it was all said and done, one thing that I found very helpful was to add a bit of liquid smoke to the extra sauce.  I then poured out most of the sauce into a plastic container and kept it for later.... I ended up using it for left over brisket tonight and made some KILLER BBQ Brisket sandwiches on Kaiser rolls with Baked seasoned freanch fries (found on this site...Yum Yum BTW).  I cut the rolls open and drizzeled the extra sauce on the insides and toasted them a bit to make them firm.   When done, I added a bit of dijon mustard on one side.  All I can say is WOW..... I get better and better at cooking every day... ;)    ",

It smelled like heaven while it was cooking and the taste didn't disappoint.  It was super-tender.  The changes I made were: instead of sliced onion I mixed in a packet of dry onion and mushroom soup mix with the beer sauce.  I used one room-temperature bottle of Sam Adams agave beer but I think any Sam Adams-type beer would work well. I used 1/2C brown sugar instead of the 3/4 C in the recipe.  Finally, after I covered the dish with foil, I let it marinate on the counter for about 20 minutes before I put in in the oven, just to give the acidity in the sauce a chance to start working on the meat.  LOVED this and I will be making this recipe all winter.  :-)",
