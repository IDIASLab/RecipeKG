The addition of the pureed peaches and lemon zest to some French Vanilla yougurt made this recipe for me. I used double the dressing to half the peaches and cake for a small trifle. I agree the dressing needs be at least doubled for the recipe. This was so light creamy and cool with a hint of citrus just summer on the porch! Thanks for the recipe!",

I purchased individual sized angel food cakes (about the size of a large cupcake) from our local grocer and using a couple of peaches a few black berries and a few raspberries i put these together using peach yogurt. Kept in the fridge most of the day these were nicely chilled by dinner. Will definitely make again.",

I was sooo disappointed in the taste of my peaches. The lemon juice and zest did help but that is why I added some red raspberries. The next time I make this I will double the yogurt mixture. It had great flavor I just wish I had more of it. I served this to 7 people and no one guessed the yogurt mixture although all of them loved it. This could be so versatile by mixing up your fresh fruits and yogurts. As is this is wonderful and I will be making it again before the fresh peaches are gone. I just hope for better peaches the next time. Another plus to this recipe is there is no whipped topping in it. I like \"real\" whipped topping but this is wonderful with the yogurt mixture. A great pick last week.:o)",
