I had to make acidified buttermilk (1 tablespoon of lemon juice per 1 cup of milk, allow to curdle for 10 minutes), but the preparation, to me, was effortless. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough oil for my dutch oven, so I used my skillet, turn the chicken over once after 10 minutes, cooking for 25 minutes total. Also I only had corn oil. I'll try peanut oil next time. Thanks again!",

This is not the BEST fried chicken I have had, but it was tasty and nice and crispy. I did not need 2 cups of buttermilk, so just pour in as much as you need to cover the chicken good. The rest of the ingredients I used the same. I used about 2 inches of oil to fry in and let it get good and brown.",

I doubled all the spices and seasonings (except salt, which I kept the same). The end result was perfectly flavorful, which to me means that it would have been bland with the written amounts. Also, I cooked the chicken between 275 and 300 degrees, and they were perfectly brown at 19 minutes cook time. The breasts were slightly dry, they should have been taken out earlier. The dark pieces were amazing, though.",
