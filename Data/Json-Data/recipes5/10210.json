I recommend cutting down on the amount of red onion and also sauteeing them first because I found the raw onions overpowerd everything. The only other tweak I would suggest is the seasoning, I think a little chili powered and cumin would go well with these. Season to your personal taste.",

The flavors blend together perfectly with the salty feta, the sweet from the potatoes, the buttery-ness of the pecans, and the slight bite of the red onion. Topped with salsa, they were was absolutely fantastic!! Plus: they're superbly easy to make! I will be making these again!! Thank you so much for the recipe!!",
