I did not have fennel (nor am I a huge fan of it), so I just left it out and added a touch more paprika and garlic.  The end result was a little salty (will use less next time) but it reminded me of BBQ ribs!  Even my cauliflower-hating husband liked this..... not that he got to eat much of it.  It was so good I ended up eating the whole head in one sitting with a side of rice.  Yep- it was THAT good.",
