It does sound odd but it tasted really good with a few changes: 1) I used my food processor for the cottage cheese because I prefer without the lumps. 2) I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. 3) Used whole wheat flour instead of white. 4) I also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I didn't use any sugar because with the maple syrup was enought for my taste. It's a great breakfast with a great source of protein and no fat, if you use fat free cottage cheese. Thanks for the recipe Jennifer, I will definitely make it again!",

Here's how I now make these: 1) substitute whole wheat flour for the white; 2) substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil; 3) add some cinnamon and vanilla.  They taste better this way, plus I feel better about feeding them to my child.\n\nOh yes, and the amount as written does NOT make enough... always at least double the recipe.  Actually when I make these, I usually make a 4x recipe and that results in a pretty normal amount of pancakes for my family.",

I follow as directed but add 1 t. baking powder and a splash of milk.  To cook I start with a hot pan and turn the temp down to med at best, cover w/ the lid slightly ajar, and cook more slowly than a usual pancake.  This produces a terrific, low carb, high protein pancake that is not quite so flat or blintz like.  I usually get 5 pancakes, about 5-6\" across.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: Delicious - and very low carb.  Four servings? - no way! I should have known when I looked at the ingredient list that this was not going to be enough for 4 - it was 2 servings at best.  The commenter who compared them to cheese blintzes was right - they have that consistency, which we happen to like; we did not find them to be fluffy at all (which was ok).  We like pancakes and usually have them over the weekend - this is a new and different one that everyone liked.",

My husband and I are training for a marathon (and trying to shed a few pounds) so I'm always looking for high-protein, low-fat, lower-carb meal ideas (not easy to find!). I made some changes to significantly reduce the fat content: I used 1% cottage cheese, 1/2c egg whites instead of 3 whole eggs, and only 1T of oil. I think next time I will try omitting the oil altogether. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of baking powder, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla (as suggested by some other reviewers), plus one package of artificial sweetener (could use 2 tsp of sugar instead of artificial sweetener). I also mashed up the cottage cheese a bit with a fork before mixing everything together. These were yummy enough to eat plain but I topped mine with raspberry jam. With all of my substitutions, this ENTIRE recipe contains about 515 calories, 51g protein (woot! woot!), and 13g fat. This recipe makes enough for two people or one really hungry person. By the way, I registered for allrecipes.com just so I could write a review on this recipe! Thanks Jennifer! ",
