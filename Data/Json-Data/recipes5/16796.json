I have made this recipe with chicken and another time with a mix of large shrimp (1.25 ilb ) and scallops (1 ilb.). I seared those seperately with a little olive oil salt and fresh cracked pepper and then added them in at the end. Both versions of this recipe were great. As for changes to the recipe in general besides what type of protien I used I could not find roasted Italian cherry peppers so I substituted an equal amount of sliced roasted red peppers and added 1/2 tsp. crushed red chili flakes. I put the flakes in with the garlic at the beginning to bring out their flavour. The 1/2 tsp. was just enough to say 'hey I'm here I'm spice but not too much spice'. If you wanted this dish to have more kick I'm sure you could use a whole tsp. without overpowering the other flavours. Also the spaghetti sauce I used was President's Choice Marinara sauce. If you're not Canadian you might not know this brand but it's a groccery store brand of okay quality. It worked out great.",

I took note in the reviews that it needed something more flavor wise so I added kosher salt and thyme to the mushrooms. I cooked the chicken separately and I didn't bother salting it because the sauce has plenty of sodium in it but i did add italian seasonings and the rest of the garlic. Once the chicken browned I combined everything and used a 1/2 cup of red wine and it was perfect. I didn't have any roasted cherry peppers on hand but will try next time or brown sugar it was great without it.",

This dish would have received five stars if it had a little more flavor. I felt as if it was missing one key spice for flavor perhaps some fresh kosher salt. Lastly I made this with spaghetti instead of linguini as this was all I had on hand (actually I forgot to buy it at the store). My one additional suggestion would be to NOT skimp on your jar of spaghetti sauce and buy a top notch brand. Afterall this is where most of our flavor is coming from.",
