        "description": "This is a traditional South African meal, and is good winter fare. Bredie is an old Cape name for a dish of meat and vegetables stewed together so that the flavors intermingle. The gravy is rich, thick and full-bodied, and is obtained by using meat with a fair amount of bone and fat, rolling it in flour and browning it before the vegetables are added. The flavor improves if left a day or two before eating. Nice with brown rice.",

By American tastes, this tastes just like a simple Swiss steak  only served in a bowl as a hearty stew.   I used venison instead of lamb.   I figured it would be a perfect substitute since lamb is a stronger meat that can come off gamey at times.  The stew wasn\u2019t as thick as I expected, so I removed the lid for the final 20 minutes of cooking and it thickened up just fine.  Hubby and I were pleasantly surprised by the tenderness of the meat since I used a cut that should have been tough.  We also expected a gamey taste, but  it wasn\u2019t gamey at all.  I\u2019m guessing the vinegar, which was also undetectable, had something to do with it.  This one is going in the keep file and one that we will have often this winter.",
