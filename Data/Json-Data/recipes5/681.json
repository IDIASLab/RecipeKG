Serve topped with sour cream, shredded Cheddar cheese, chopped chives, hot sauce, and sliced jalapenos (or habanero if you like the heat).",

Beans, no beans, thick enough where a spoon will stand up etc. I am definitely on the bean wagon but I do prefer my chili a little thinner than this. The only liquid was the little bit that comes with the tomatoes which was not near enough in my opinion. With that being said though, this is a great recipe for things like frito pie, chili cheese fries, and that sort of thing where you don't want a lot of liquid.",
