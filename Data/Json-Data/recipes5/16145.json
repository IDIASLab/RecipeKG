If your store doesn't carry some of these meat cuts, at least be sure to add the bacon (or even salt pork) and the pigs feet - or if feet sound too scary to you, add some ham hocks.  We always added chorizo, and a salami that had been cut into large bite size chunks.  In the last 1/2 hour, skin a large orange, and pull apart in 4-6 sections, and toss into the pot.  That's an authentic addition, and it really gives it an especially nice flavor.",
