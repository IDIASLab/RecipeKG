For the most part followed the recipe but wanted a main dish summer salad so poached a chicken breast with garlic oregano pepper salt and a little white wine chilled sliced thinly and put on top of salad. Made the dressing a couple of hours ahead of serving to allow flavors to blend. Doubled the dressing to accommodate the additional ingredient used most but not all of the extra dressing. Perfect for hot summer days. From a serving perspective can do all of the prep work in advance and then toss salad together just before serving making this convenient for entertaining.",
