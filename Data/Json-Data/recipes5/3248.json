My problem was using the condenced soup as a short cut there is no brand specification which can lead this recipe well astray from it's intent. Also I don't believe a real souffle can make up for the lack of real skill going into it with a condenced soup as a replacement for eggs and cream. I also seriously suggest adding another spice or veggie into this recipe to lighten it a bit. How about some dry mustard or paprika? Also some shallots and/or minced onions added to the butter to saute fits well. Also about 1 cup sifted flour to this mixture helps firm and set up the souffle and add a slight crust.",
