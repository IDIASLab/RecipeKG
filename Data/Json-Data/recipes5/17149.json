Sauerkraut is not much familiar in Japan except at German beer houses, but I have always more loved garnished sauerkraut than sausages.  I failed first time, though. I think I wasn't taking much seriously the advice to have the sauerkraut well drained.  So the second time, I duly followed that tip, and the result was just perfect.  I just love the aroma while baking, and in my kitchen where the bread is now sitting.  Thanks for this inspiring recipe.",
