However I could have frozen to death from the cold stares that I received from everyone else around the table. I understand what they feel. A large block of cream cheese does not a sauce make. Since I try to stay away from white flour and processed food I always use whole wheat pasta so of course this will absorb more sauce and make every sauce just a little bit more dry. I would and will make this recipe again but with a classic alfredo sauce to which I shall add the salmon lemon pepper onions and dijon. Oh well more left overs for me!",

I used smoked salmon that I made in my smoker using apple wood and for the water apple juice. It turned out great! I grow my own herbs so I had fresh dill just not the amount called for so I used what fresh I had and used dry to make up the amount called for. I also didn't have quite enough cream cheese so I used ricotta to make up the difference. The results were amazing. Great recipe that I have now saved for the future! Sooooooo good!",

Mine was tasty but VERY dry even though I ended up doubling the cream cheese in an effort to have some sauce. Throwing the cooked pasta & reserved water back into the pot adding all the remaining ingredients and stirring until the cream cheese melts as the recipe instructs did not work well at all. I may make it again but with changes (additional liquid for sure) to make an actual sauce with smoked salmon lemon & dill. Nevertheless it was tasty.",
