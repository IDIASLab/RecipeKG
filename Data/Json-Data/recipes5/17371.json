I made it twice and added a little warm water while it was mixing (just enough water to pull it together.) I think the celery seed is a little strong but that is an easy fix. Right out of the oven it is excellent. I think it ranks right up there with the chili bread I have made from this website. It smells great mixing AND baking. Thanks for another keeper!!",

I didn't have celery seed so I tried to compensate with a little fresh minced celery leaves. Also added maybe 1-1/2 tsp. of fresh minced sage along with the rubbed sage called for. Other than that I made no other substitutions or additions. What I got was a bread so fragrant it left me hungry for it before it was even done baking and I cut into it immediately after it came out of the oven! It is lightly but perfectly seasoned and has a little rustic heartiness about it because of the cornmeal. It's a light brown in color moist but not TOO moist and enough density and heft to take it seriously! I suppose however that how the texture turns out can be largely determined by bread machine humidity amount and type of yeast etc. I used active dry yeast where I normally use quick-rise and I did notice a difference from other breads I've made. I actually think I prefer the active dry - it doesn't overrise as the quick-rise tends to for me. Very similar to another bread on this site I know hubs is gonna love this and I'll be making it often. Great recipe!",
