The only folks you might scare away are the ones who brought regular pasta salads. There's just something delightfully addictive about this special combination of cold and spicy.

First, I was interested in this because it didn't have a lot of fat in the dressing, but that's the first thing you notice, and the vinegar tends to be too aggressive without the fat.  The ratio of noodles to other \"stuff\" was also a little high.  Mods were as follows:  Added 2 TBSP Canola oil,  Added 4 ozs. Edamame, Added 2 TBSP Soy sauce (used lite so that might have been why), about a tsp of fresh grated ginger, about 2 TBSP toasted sesame seeds.   If a next time, will cut back on the pasta and add celery and/or bok choy, more onion, increase overall dressing by 50% with added oil.  I would also use the second piece of chicken.",

Dressing is delicious , I made as written with exception of adding a little prepared ginger to the mix.  Next time I make it I\u2019m going to 1 1/2 the dressing, I\u2019m a saucy person.  I like the previous reviewers idea of adding edamame.  I did not add mint, just personal preference. This was a trial run for an upcoming block party, I\u2019m going to put this in individual Chinese take out containers with chopsticks!  Thanks for another great recipe CJ!",
