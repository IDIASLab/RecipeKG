As I've learned with most oatmeal based recipes the batter really needs to sit for about 15 minutes or so to give the oatmeal a chance to soak up some of the excess liquid and puff up and expand. These puffed up nicely and cooked up without issues on my griddle. I served this with a pumpkin spice syrup and homemade breakfast sausage. The kids and I really enjoyed this.",

They cooked up perfectly no extra time needed. Now I'm not the best pancake flipper in the world - so I didn't bother to make the choc. chip face while cooking but rather after cooking by cutting out pieces of the pancake to accommodate the choc. chips. Unfortunately it only worked for the eyes and nose. The mouth I'm not sure what happened lol - I need some carving skills! Haha. I wish it did turn out pretty but hey I can't complain about the flavour of these pancakes! It's awesome! I was going to serve with pecan butter but it turns out the chocolate was the perfect compliment to the pancakes IMO. I think next time I may just add the chocolate chips into the batter rather than trying to make a face out of them. Thank you for sharing your recipe! It's very delicious.",

I followed the recipe exactly but I did let the batter sit for 15 minutes as suggested by another reviewer and I had no problem with the cooking time. I found the cloves to be a little over powering - I really couldn't taste the pumpkin at all. If I make these again I will omit the cloves entirely and maybe add more cinnamon.

I put some on the griddle anyway and kept flipping them because they weren't cooking through. Both sides were burnt and the center STILL wasn't cooked through! The only way I thought I could save these is by throwing them in a muffin tin and putting it in the oven. They aren't done yet so I don't know if that was enough to save them. I gave one of the non-burnt 'pancake pucks' to try and she said it was weird. I am never making this again!! EDIT I pulled the 'muffins' out of the oven after about 50 minutes at 350 degrees and they were once again burnt on the outside and RAW in the center!!",
