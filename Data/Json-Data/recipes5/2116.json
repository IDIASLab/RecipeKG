I followed the measurements exactly, I cut the recipe in half (just for me), I was able to make 8 tortillas, a few the size of fajitas and the rest a little larger than that. \nI can taste the difference between these and store bought. Fresh tastes way better, the outcome is awesome, I rolled as thin as I could and still got a thicker tortilla, was very satisfying. Saved me money, and took the same amount of time as if I would have gone to the store to buy. I like that I can make a half batch and not have so many leftovers. This was my first time making tortillas, overall it was a success.",
