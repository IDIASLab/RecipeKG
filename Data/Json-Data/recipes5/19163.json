After the rice was cooked I stirred in the pumpkin puree (I used organic pumpkin puree) the original amount of pumpkin pie spice and only about a scant 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a couple tablespoons of butter (we're watching our calories/sugars here). I served it with a float of fat free half-n-half on top. This was quite good even with my adjustments. This was a great way for me to get extra vitamins into my kids and to use up pantry ingredients to make a filling and tasty breakfast. Next time I may add a chopped apple or a handful of organic raisins. I also think this might be good with an egg thrown in and a little vanilla to add a little more protein and to fake you out to think you're having rice pudding.",
