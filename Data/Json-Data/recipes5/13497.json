Next time I am going to add some broccoli and perhaps some lowfat cheese to the mix instead of parmesan.",

It doesn't rise as much with the whole wheat flour so I also fill the cups higher than I would normally which usually only gives me 8 muffins. I also tried greasing the tins with coconut oil this time instead of Pam olive oil spray or Crisco...and they taste better! One other thing...I have a small hot oven but I still needed to go 14 minutes in baking them probably because of the changes I made.",
