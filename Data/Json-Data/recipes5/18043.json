I didn't add the veggies nor the liquid smoke and the parsely due to it's unavailablility but regardless the recipe turned out to my satisfaction but I'm giving it a 5-star rating because my three picky teenagers thought it was the best they had ever eaten and actually thought that I had bought the sloppy joe mix in the store. Imagine their wide eyes and suddenly stopped chewing when I told them it was not from the store but from this website. They all three simultaneously gave me the thumbs up symbol before they resumed eating! Brenda",

                "reviewBody": "3780 calories for the total recipe as written (adding a 1/2 head of cabbage totals up to 3920) I have been using this recipe for the past 10 YEARS it was the 1st recipe I printed off the internet!:) Two big changes I have made: HALVE the vinegar and lemon juice. Chop up an entire head of cabbage in the food processor (to small crumbs) and add it to the doubled recipe (just a half head for the recipe as written). It might look like too much but it's not it blends perfectly with the texture of the groundbeef and my family can't tell the difference when I make it without the cabbage. Cabbage is super cheap (and healthy!) and is a great way to really stretch the meat in this dish without gumming it up with oatmeal like so many recipes call for. This is a superb freezer meal--I make a double batch every couple months or whenever ground beef is on a great sale and bag it up in freezer bags. Quicker (and cheaper!) to just defrost a bag quickly than even opening a can and browning up the meat. My family gives this a two big thumbs up--with the caveat of the vinegar/lemon juice change;) (oh and you can use the un-condensed version of the gumbo soup if you can't find it I've done that often with no noticeable difference it'll just need to simmer a bit longer to compensate for the additional liquid. Another frugal hint: Aldi's often carries the uncondensed version in their Fit & Active brand if you have one of their stores nearby) Anyways Thanks Mark love the recipe!",
