I was worried that the venison back strap would be gamey and tough but it was \"cut with a fork\" tender and amazing!! I didn't change any of the ingredients for this recipe. The only thing that I did different was I browned my meat as directed but I put it in a Dutch oven instead for a 9x13 pan. Poured the sauce over the meat put the lid on and popped it in the oven for an hour. Served it with mashed potatoes and it was A-MAZING!!!",
