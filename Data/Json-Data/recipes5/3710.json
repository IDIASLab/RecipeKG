It's a Friday night tradition for my husband and I to go to our favorite Greek joint and have gyros, but freezing temps this evening so I decided to make these at home.  Delicious!  The sauce was excellent, I would recommend adding more lemon, greek seasoning, and dill.  I doubled the garlic as well.  I used 2/3 cup balsamic and 1/3 cup olive oil in place of the vinegrette.  No grilling tonight, so I baked the chicken with some marinade for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Perfect!  Thanks for sharing.",

Reminded me of my husband and I's favorite college Pita haunt.  \nAs to the people confused by the recipe's chicken marinade make sure you are using a balsamic vinegrette as specified instead of straight balsamic vinegar, 2 TOTALLY different things.  Vinegrette is a salad dressing made with equal parts or slightly more Olive Oil to balsamic in addition to garlic, herbs, etc..  \nThe recipe is just fine as written!  \nThank you for the walk down memory lane!",

                "reviewBody": "FANTASTIC!!! A little time consuming to make, but 100+++% worth the effort involved. If you prep these in stages, they're much more manageable to make.  I quickly threw together my marinade / tzatziki sauce early this afternoon, so all I had to do at dinnertime was grill my chicken (on my indoor reversible grill). To all of you wanting to give this a try, I have a few tips to share. First, you MUST use balsamic vinaigrette (found in the salad dressings aisle of your grocer), DO NOT use straight-up balsamic vinegar! Vinaigrette contains spices & EVOO to help tame the tartness of the vinegar. Second, Greek yogurt is a FAR superior choice for this cucumber sauce.  Tzatziki should be thick, not thin or watery. Unless you strain your yogurt, you will end up w/ runny sauce. Greek yogurt has already been strained. Yes, it's more expensive, but it's also more convenient. Finally, to ensure your cucumbers properly \"sweat,\" toss them w/ salt (salt draws OUT water), & then do what reviewer MOLLE888 did - place in a colander / sieve set over a bowl w/ another bowl on top. Put a heavy can in the bowl to add some pressure & watch the liquid seep to the bottom! You will have PERFECT tzatziki every time (promise!). Served w/ red onion, tomatoes & iceberg lettuce (no pepperoncini or olives for us), these are a spot on copycat of our favorite local chain's Athenian chicken pitas! Seasoned curly fries completed our meal. Thanks for sharing, Chris! :-)",

It makes ALL the difference. I served the pepperoncini whole on the side. I have made this several times and have begun to use balsamic vinegrette in place of the dressing and \"Just 2 Good\" Italian dressing as a marinade. I also used tin foil to hold the taco-like shape of the pita bread. This keeps it warm too. Perhaps the best tip I have is to use strained yogurt -- I found greek yogurt at the local specialty foods shop but it might be available at Whole Foods / Wild Oats. Also I just cubed the cucumbers b/c I like the crunch.",
