It was way too sweet for my taste. I may just take corn tortillas and layer them several deep in the dish and then add the meat/bean mix. I might try adding some cheese to the meat mix too,  basically it was good ,just needs tweaking in my opinion.",

                "reviewBody": "So, I made this dish tonight. I made some changes because that is how I roll. I wanted to put my own little spin on it. Here are the changes that I made: meat loaf mix ( less grease to drain, more flavor to the meat), 1/2 of an onion & 1/4 red pepper when meat was browned and drained. I added with the taco seasoning and waited then added salsa (3/4 cup because I had the chunky kind). Okay, the corn bread part. I was born in the north where the corn bread is well corn bread...its kinda dry. In the south it is sweet and soft. Soo, I appreciate the south and their take on everything being sweet like sweet tea, sweet honey butter with biscuits and sweet corn bread. I used creamed corn 1/2 cup. Awesome!!! I buttered the pie pan like it was getting ready for a slip and slide. 33 minutes in an oven that started out cold on 350, I was questioning it. Thinking this person better not be lying to me about this part, because the back up plan was grilled cheese sandwiches. 5 mins to sit. I used a serving pie knife. It came out prefect. The tortilla chips were crushed to the size of corn flakes. It was great. No one talked and when I asked if it was ok my two kids and husband asked when will I make it again and I was told to put a rush on it and do it again. Highly recommend.",

The cornbread is already sweet but adding the honey doesn\u2019t really add any more sweetness and is worth the added texture. The only thing I changed was I added a little more heat. I chopped a few canned jalape\u00f1os and added them to the meat mixture. Yum!",

My taco pie came out perfect. Was not dry at all. I did use Daisy sour cream to put on top with cut up Avocado and just used crumbled Tostitos chips on top. We definitely will be using this recipe again! Thanks for a great recipe!",
