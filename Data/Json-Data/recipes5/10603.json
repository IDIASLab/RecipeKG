Instead, I believe I used a chuck roast that was quite a bit bigger than a 3 pounder and it was a huge party pleaser. Probably the best thing ive ever made for my DnD party. As for the pan sauce, I had a major mishap whenever I realized I didn't have any stock of any variety. In a fit of pan dripping-induced panic, I poured a bottle of honey ginger beer in the pan to deglaze it. Now, I know this is weird. Bizzare even. But holy mother of beef it was SO good. Sweet, spicy from the pepper, and tart from the balsamic it was nothing s short of a breakthrough of culinary magesty. 10/10 would devour again.",
