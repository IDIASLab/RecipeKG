I did cut back on the amount of butter and added in garlic, 2 T of fresh lemon juice, 1 garlic clove chopped up and also fresh chopped dill. I did not use a lot of dill after reading what other reviewers posted, just 1 tsp plus a little more (eyeball the amount) and I also mixed it with the lemon butter sauce before pouring it all over the salmon. The salmon was placed on a foil and after I poured the sauce over it I folded the aluminum tightly and baked 350 degrees for 25 minutes. The salmon came out sooooo moist, flaky, tasty, full of flavor, nothing overpowering. You can play with the amount of dill, lemon juice, etc., so the tastes suits you. I am glad I did cut back on the lemon juice and fresh dill. I also made a dill sauce (from this website) which I served alongside the salmon to dip in and I also made this with mushroom rice pilaf (from this website) with sauteed veggies. A very healthy and tasty dish. a winner and keeper in my recipe box.",
