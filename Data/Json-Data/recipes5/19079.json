So I threw together what I had and came up with this tangy, spicy sweet marinade that adds flavor, but doesn't mask the flavor of the salmon. My kids and sister loved it.  They said it was better than 'restaurant salmon' It's great served with wild rice and stir fried veggies.",

Added a hint of tabasco as well to give it a little kick as didn't have any red pepper flakes. I did find it difficult however to get the right balance between the soy sauce and the red wine vinegar - one kept overpowering the other but the tabasco did seem to offset this. Nonetheless a great recipe perfect for salmon!",

I personally didn't notice the red pepper at all. Mine turned out really sweet but that may be because I used dark brown sugar and not light and I didn't have any red wine vinegar (nor did the store) so I used red wine instead. This is a very easy recipe too just prepare ahead of time and pop it in the oven when you get home. I had mine with mac'n'cheese. Not very classy but yummy and pretty good for a college student;)",

I'm not sure that broiling would be my first choice as the fish came out a bit tough. However I don't have a broiler with a low setting only an oven with a broil setting. For that circumstance I'd suggest 10 min or less total cooking time. I think it might worl well on a grill as well. The marinade was excellent & I'm thinking of trying it with beef or other fish as well. Dirtying a blender is unnecessary. I got a whisk & was able to dissolve the sugar in the bowl I mixed it in in just a minute.",
