Biryani can be a time-consuming dish, but this is an easy way to make it from scratch. The end result is packed full of flavor and can be spicy. Best eaten with yogurt or Indian raita.",

I pre-cooked the rice for 4 minutes instead of 2. I put everything in the crockpot as directed but 45 minutes later I stirred it all together and changed the setting to low for the last 45 minutes. Turned out well. Flavor was delicious!",

Also I wasn't sure if I was suppose to leave the pods in the dish or remove them. There is a lot of steps but they aren't difficult and it's nice to cook from scratch. I will try it again with a few modifications.",
