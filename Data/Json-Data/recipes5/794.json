        "description": "An easy way to make a tasty eggplant dish. Grilling the eggplant gives it a surprisingly different flavor, and it tastes great with peppers, feta cheese, and spices. I eat this as a stand-alone dish, but my husband likes to eat his on toasted potato rolls as a sandwich filling.  If you eat it without a bun it's gluten-free, as well as vegetarian. It's also great topped with a fried egg!",
