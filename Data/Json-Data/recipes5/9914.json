I used chicken broth for water, ground flax seed, oat flour, oat bran, and wheat germ for part of the flour and the rest in white flour. Used Italian seasonings, garlic powder, and shredded cheese and also used walnut oil and olive oil to add more omega 3s. Nice to have a healthy alternative to some of the very unhealthy crackers and junk food out there.  As far as making one cookie sheet???  I guess I rolled mine out pretty thin then cuz I used 4 cookie sheets!  Turned out nice and crispy.  Great with cream cheese.",

                "reviewBody": "I follow a rule when I find and rate recipes on this website: at least the first go 'round, I follow the recipe to the letter and rate/review the result. So for this Wheat Cracker recipe, I didn't change anything when I made it. I understand that many are using this recipe as a jumping-off point for their own creations--that's great! I may do the same the next time I try this recipe. But for the puroses of review, I believe it is unfair to change a bunch of things and then give a review of my creation rather than what the actual recipe produced. That's just me.   So. I have to say that although the dough couldn't have been easier to make and roll out, the recipe did not guide me to roll them out as thin as I should have. I rolled to an 1/8 of an inch or thinner, as the recipe read, but I should have gone thinner still! Like, way thin! Because I couldn't get the crackers crisp enough and I kept baking and checking and baking and checking, past the 40 minute mark, and finally, I gave up. Also they were quite dry and bland. They may have promise to be transformed into something better, but it will take lots of tweaking and trial and error to figure out how to make them tasty.  So this recipe is actually sort of like half a recipe. It's up to you to figure out how to complete it.",

I used the new white whole wheat flour from King Arthur and used EVOO instead... then added some dried rosemary that I ground up with my mortar and pestle. I rolled them out nice and thin (I found them very easy to roll)and put them on parchment paper. I then brushed LIGHTLY with more oil and sprinkled with coarse kosher salt. YUMMMMM!!! I also scored them with my pastry wheel for a more professional look. This makes a LOT of crackers but that's GOOD because they will last a little longer! I keep them in a ziploc bag for freshness... and they taste just as good several days later! Thanks for the excellent recipe Ray Anne!",

I also found that the thinner you get these the better they are and I found that they needed to cook longer than advertised. But I am making these again today.",
