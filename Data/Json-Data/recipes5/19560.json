I personally liked them better without the nuts, but that's just because I'm not a big fan of walnuts. I really liked the fluffy texture. These are lightly, not overly spiced. For some reason every time I make pumpkin cookies I have an allergic skin reaction so I have to wear latex gloves :-P Edit: Beware! These cookies get very sticky on the surface after a while. It doesn't affect the taste, but it is kind of weird.",

It's the end of August and I pulled out a pkg of pumpkin puree (AR's Pumpkin Puree) I had in the freezer... and then goodness happened:) As I was adding the spices I got an excited flutter in my stomach reminding me of Fall and all things autumn. Thanks for an excellent recipe. I changed a couple things out of necessity(didn't have on hand or allergy) but I'm sure it didn't change the main objective or flavor/texture, it came out as described. Changes: whole wheat instead of all purpose flour, allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice, applesauce instead of apple butter and chocolate chips instead of walnuts(allergy). Very good recipe!!!",
