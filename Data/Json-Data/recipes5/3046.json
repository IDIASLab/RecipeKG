I either doubled or tripled all the spices (I didn't have paprika or turmeric so I omitted those, but I added white pepper, coriander, chili powder, and cinnamon    to taste. I also used cumin powder as well as black cumin seeds). I also put in about 6 small-medium cloves of garlic and 2 tbsp fresh ginger. I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I omitted those, but I did add in a whole (large) can of diced tomatoes (rather than crushed). I also used the liquid from the chick peas. I threw everything except chicken in a dutch oven and simmered it til veggies & chick peas were tender - maybe 20-30 min. Meanwhile, I sauteed the chicken in olive oil, garlic and salt & pepper and when it was almost cooked I added it to the stewing veggies and spices and cooked it about 10 min longer. I cooked up some couscous with cinnamon & raisins and served the chicken and veg over the couscous. The sweetness of the cinnamon-raisin couscous was delicious with the spicy and flavorful chicken dish. It was so yummy!! I recommend using this recipe as a guideline but not following it literally - make it your own and you will probably like it!",

I do love the Morrocan Chicken I make. I have a few variations. Usually I am fine with just 2-3 chicken breast filets sauteed in 3 Tbsp olive oil. I also add one bell pepper to the dish with more carrots and celery. I think the more vegetables the better. I also use less salt; like 1 tsp. As far as the spices I just use about 3 Tbsp curry powder from Spice Island; they do the work for you. It has cumin coriander fenugreek ginger turmeric dill seed black pepper red pepper mace cardamon and cloves. I add the addt'l 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to the curry powder. I don't use chicken broth but would like to next time. I use 1 can tomato sauce and 1/2 cup red wine. And finally I add 1/2 cup or more walnuts and 1/2 cup raisins. These ingredients really enhance the flavor and texture of this dish. Overall this has become one of my favorite dishes to make because it is really easy and delicious. Serve with couscous simmered in chicken broth and little olive oil.",

Also I used instead one can chicken broth the liquid from the can of chickpeas and a can of diced tomatoes undrained. This is probably why it was so soupy but luckily I just drained it and labeled the excess liquid Moroccan Tomato Soup. (That was yummy too.) I didn't have zucchini available so I just omitted it. I also am in the habit of marinating the chicken ahead of time like my mom taught me with salt cayenne pepper and cooking sherry (just enough to wet it) and letting it sit for an hour in the fridge. I think next time I will marinate with white vinegar instead to give it a sour twist. Also used the juice of a whole lemon. It was a little spicier than I had expected because I used cayenne to marinate on top of the 1/4 tsp cayenne in the recipe but we like it hot here. It got a great review from my family and I am sure to make it again. I had some of my special Cornbread with Anise Seed leftover and served it with dinner. The sweet licorice flavor offset the spicyness beautifully and it sopped up the sauce too.",
