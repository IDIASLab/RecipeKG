We actually didn't care for the Snickers bars in this as the texture was too chewy but that's our personal opinion. We really enjoyed the apples mixed into the pudding mixture and it tasted like caramel apples so that was fun. All in all we enjoyed this and I would make it again but I would find a replacement for the Snickers. Thanks for sharing.:)",
