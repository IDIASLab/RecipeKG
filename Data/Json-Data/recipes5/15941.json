It's a keeper for us very tasty not bland the way I made it . try using Mexican cheddar cheese too .adds to the taste . use 23 shells too  fits better in a 13\u00d79 pan . Also  double the sauce recipe for the top of the shells. a tip from me I put tooth picks on top of shells after I put cheese on the top of the shells to keep from sticking worked well too.  Hope you enjoy !",

It was very messy to make, about halfway through fighting with the shell stuffing part of this recipe I placed the rest of the mixture into a large storage bag, cut the corner and piped the rest into the shells. That worked much better and was not as messy. I would also triple the sauce recipe for the top.....someone said double but I ended up making a triple batch for a 9x12.  I would not make this a menu staple but would make it for guests, potluck, etc.",
