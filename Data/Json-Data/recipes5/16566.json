The instructions for the recipe were pretty simple but not being able to taste any other ingredient. I feel the cardamom could have been left out. Please note that you need to be very liberal with the non-stick cooking spray for this recipe brown sugar tends to stick harder then a cake when baked in a pan and you will find that a recipe like this won't come out of a pan as easy. Recommend spraying with non-stick spray and lining the bottom with parchment paper or wax paper for easy removal of the baked item.",
