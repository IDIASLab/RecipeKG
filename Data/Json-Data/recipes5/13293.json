Followed the recipe for the steaks but made adjustments for the gravy.  She doesn't eat mushrooms so I had to leave them out, also changed the sour cream to low fat milk (was out of sour cream) with the beef broth and an extra tablespoon of flour.  Taste good!",

I skipped the 7 tablespoons of butter and used 1/2 of the onion soup package instead.  That way I dumped a bunch of calories and it was healthier for me and my heart.  You will have to figure out how much of the onion soup to use. Very tasty.",

I did not have mushrooms and didn't buy b/c I'm the only in the family that eats them. I separated out the gravy and used a jar of mushroom truffle \"creme\" that contained porcini and button mushrooms as well as truffles.  The flavor was sensational. Additionally, I only had one beef bullion cube. No broth. I made the bullion and added it to some beef gravy I had. Again, delicious. It proved to me that this recipe is versatile enough to work with substitutions if you don't have everything it calls for. \nOne suggestion: Recipe says to divide the two pounds of meat into six patty steaks. They were huge! Way too big  to eat in one sitting. Would be good to divide to into 8 patty steaks. Will definitely make this again!",
