When I order this at my favorite mexican resteraunt, the consistancy is about the same as my recipe, with extra \"sauce\". The reason I think this is awesome is because when I wrap my filling in my tortillas, I like to dip my tortilla in the extra sauce. OR, I like to be all ghetto and save the leftover sauce and mix it with my Take-Out Fake-Out Mexican Rice and either eat it as is or wrap THAT in a tortilla. Either way, I make it that way for that reason just because the recipe is so good that I don't want to waste one drop of it's awesomeness. No, I'm not being conceited, it's just really that good. You've got to take my word on that. Or just make it for yourself.",
