It's an even easier recipe if you bake the meatballs in a 400 degree oven for about 25 minutes rather than on the stove. You can stick them in the oven and do other things while they bake. Still scrape the sheet they bake on for \"pan drippings\" though!",

I baked the meatballs at 375 for 15 minutes and they were done perfectly. When making the sauce instead of the drippings since I was baking the meatballs I used 3 T of melted butter. I replaced one cup of water with a cup of coffee and left out the instant coffee. I did simmer the meatballs in the sauce after they were cooked. The meatballs came out tender and flavorful. I'll be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!",
