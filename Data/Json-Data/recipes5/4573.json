I couldn't find strawberries at the store (during strawberry season no less!) so I subbed blackberries. I also used a spring mix (it was on sale) for the lettuce and added some sunflower seeds for some crunch (personal preference not necessary). The chicken came out perfectly charred and juicy and complimented the other flavors of the salad well. What a lovely combination! Thanks Amy!",
