I was happy that there is only the merest hint of sweetness. Thank you this will go in the recipe box.",

However the end result to my surprise was perfection! delicious fresh bread!!! Will put in a bit more honey next time. Definitely making this recipe again!",

                "reviewBody": "I scaled this recipe to 12 servings (1 loaf) but I see that the previous reviewer scaled in half for one loaf. I baked this in a 9x5 pan and even after 1-1/2 hours on the final rise it never did rise to 1\" above the loaf pan. Unfortunately when I was putting the pan into the oven it slipped out of my hand onto the oven rack and deflated so I didn't take a picture. However I'm going to try this again making half a recipe and using one 9x5 pan. If you're scaling to one loaf you may want to consider an 8x4 loaf pan which should give you more height. On the positive side the dough really was easy to work with and it tasted good so I'll do an update soon on my next effort.",

This was my first attempt at bread and I had to use quite a bit more flour than the 6 that it calls for but in the directions it said it may take more so I just went with it. Also the honey though it sweetens the bread doesnt offer a lot of honey taste which I guess i expected. All in all this was a delicious bread! I will make it again",

I did have to add about 1/2 cup more flour and instead of making this into 2 loaves like others did I made it into 4. It made for small loaves but it's just the 2 of us so that works even better. I used the bread machine but took it out after the dough cycle and baked on 350 for 40 minutes. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!",
