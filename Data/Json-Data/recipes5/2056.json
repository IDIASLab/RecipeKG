I was told I was seen sticking extra in freezer but couldn't I go ahead and cook those too?  24 for 6 people was not enough.  Went remarkably well with a big pitcher of lemonade!  Kids and adults raved over them.  BIG keeper!  Thanks Melissa.  Everyone is looking forward to a repeat!",

I made these for Super Bowl Sunday this year and they turned out great! I coated twice per the instructions but I still had a slight problem with the cheese oozing out. Make sure you coat the cheese well with the breadcrumbs. Just as good as store bought but I had the satisfaction of making them myself! Thanks Melissa for the inspiration!",

I cut this recipe back by half (I didn't want to use 2 1/2 eggs--I went ahead and just used three). I don't normally keep bread crumbs on hand, what I DID have was a couple bags of those Texas Toast croutons (free due to couponing!!!)--I ground them down to crumbs using my food processor. Other than that small change, I kept to the recipe. I did fry them in hot oil in my cast iron skillet. I made sure to watch the sticks and turn them just slightly with my tongs to make sure they browned evenly. Very simple. The boys thought this was the BEST. I swear, they had all of them gone in ten minutes. If that. Great recipe--it may not be an everyday indulgence but every now and then, it's nice to have some cheesy deep fried goodness.",

Such a nice coating and they froze so well. I took them out of the hot oil as soon as they browned so as not to burn. I followed that up with a few seconds in the microwave to be sure they were done inside. I served them with \"Clone of a pretzel dip\" and they were so YUMMY! They made a great addition to our \"dippers\". Thank you mis7up for sharing your YUMMY recipe! I added it to my cookbook and it has definitely found a home at our house.",
