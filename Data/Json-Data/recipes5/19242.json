Also perfect for those days when you are craving grilled fare, but the weatehr is not condusive to outdoor cooking.  Next time (if I decide to make these again - my bf thought they were just \"OK\" as well), I'd double the cayenne as I couldn't taste it at all.  I will also make a mustard dipping sauce for the brats (just seemed as if something were missing...)  Serve with German potato salad on the side.  Overall a neat idea for cooking bratwurst.
