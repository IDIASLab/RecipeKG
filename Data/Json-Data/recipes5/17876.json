It was lumpy and kind of gross-looking...I didn't add water as others have done because I was afraid to affect the taste. So I served it lumpy and people still liked it! The second time I prepared it shortly before the meal and kept it warm on the stove and that worked out perfectly. Delicious sauce!",
