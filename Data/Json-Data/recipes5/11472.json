It did not come very close to what I've seen and eaten in Spain but I think that was my error and I plan on trying again. It certainly was good if not gourmet. When I do try this again I will: 1. Make sure the potatoes don't stick to the pan when I brown them. Otherwise they will spoil the \"flip\" process. 2. Try boiling the potatoes a bit first to speed the process.",

This is an essential part of the process if you want a moist and tender tortilla (as it is supposed to be). Don't worry if your potatoes go a little bit mushy and stick together in the end you're gonna mix them with eggs and fry the whole thing.... I can assure you will not notice if the potatoes were stuck or not before. The amount of eggs depends on their size you have to add enough eggs (liquids) to dip the potatoes (sometimes when i'm out of eggs and don't have enough of them to cover the potatoes i add a dash of milk and it turns out even moister). By the way it tastes really good if you make it just from potatoes onions and green pepper!!! It is worth a try!!",

                "reviewBody": "I give this recipe 4 points because I think it's using too much potatoes. I love the idea of frying the potatoes more than boiling. Don't think you have to deepfrying them. Use enough oil to make them look shiny in the pan. Use mid to hing temperature and lower it when potatoes are golden. Add amounts of onions and fry till they look clear and starting to burn a little. They should be crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Lower your temperature when pouring the eggs. A burned tortilla doesn't have a good flavor. Never over cook it. Let it slowly love the pan and remove it right before it's completely done. The warmness remaining will do the trick of a cooked but still tender tortilla. ENJOY!!!",
