Used as a stuffing for mushrooms however is definitely worth a five. I took another commenter's advice for the second time I tried making this and added cream cheese for stuffed mushrooms. I added about a cup of cream cheese and set it in the refrigerator for about six hours or so. I chopped the stems off of baby bell and white mushrooms and sauteed them in butter for about three or four minutes adding a little lemon juice at the end (goes really well with mushrooms in my opinion). I very carefully scooped out the middle of the mushroom caps to fill with the Gorgonzola cheese mix and then baked in a preheated oven at 375 degrees for about ten minutes although another five to ten minutes probably couldn't have hurt. I still had some dip left over and will probably use that for crackers. Thanks for the recipe!",
