And, babbini ur totally right, when i submitted this recipe to the site , i put red curry powder, and u can substitute it for cayenne pepper too, but i think it was a typing mistake, they deleted the word red. And u can substitue galangal by ginger, however don't skip the lime leaves or the lemongrass, it makes a big difference. thanks again!!",

Next time I will probably double it. 3) I used regular yellow curry powder and it still came out good. I will try Thai red powder next time.
