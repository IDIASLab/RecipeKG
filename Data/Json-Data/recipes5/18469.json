Pork was very tender and the counterbalance of the minor sweet ingredients tempered the sourness of the kraut perfectly. My only changes were not draining the kraut so I could retain the liquid in the roaster layering half the kraut in the bottom of the roaster before placing the browned pork on it and I removed the browned pork out of the skillet then deglazed the pan using the white cooking wine before adding the other ingredients and rest of kraut to the skillet. I poured everything on top of the browned pork ribs in the roaster then covered to cook for about 2.5 hours. We served this over hash browns (not crispy bec/I was out of potatoes to mash) and my boys each had two helpings. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
