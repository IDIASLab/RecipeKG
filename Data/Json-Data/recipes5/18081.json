I grew up with Clair and Carl's and MC Sweeney's in Plattsburgh, ny.  this recipe is not close to those.  i think the next time i will not put all of the sugar and about half the ketchup, and replace it with more sauce maybe do 16 oz of tomato sauce.  I did add the cumin, and red crushed pepper.  just a hint from watching my mom make her version, she boiled the ground beef and it makes it really small so you don't have to stand over it breaking it up with your spatula.  Unfortunately i can not get my mom because she has passed on.   I promise it works.  just drain it and another thing you can do to add a layer of flavor is put some pepper and cumin and onion powder in the water with the beef. I hope this helps everyone!",
