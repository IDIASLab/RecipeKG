You could even use 3 different types of chocolate - plain, milk chocolate, and white - to create a tri-color effect! This recipe makes 2 or 3 large eggs or several smaller eggs, depending on your egg mold size. If you like, fill your chocolate eggs with smaller chocolate eggs or the candy of choice.",
