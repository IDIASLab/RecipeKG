I suggest you make the stuffing instead of using it in the dry form as the recipe indicates.   Moist stuffing will adhere to your chicken better than dry.  I also didn't add drizzled butter because the stuffing has butter in it. In addition, I put mozzarella cheese and a half of slice of bacon inside each chicken roll. I also used a tooth pick to secure the rolled up chicken.",

That is the only way you will get them to roll. On that note cheese or something melty would have been good in the middle. Overall good recipe but you could turn these from good to great with a few tweaks.",
