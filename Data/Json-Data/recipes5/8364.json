I bought live mussels that were already debearded. My boyfriend is from Cape Breton NS and had lots of good advice for making mussels. Soak them in fresh water for a half hour and they'll filter out most of the sand. Throw out any mussels that don't close up tight after being soaked and after steaming throw out any that don't open. This made a great romantic Valentine's Day meal with a few glasses of wine and some French bread!",

This will become part of our rotation.\n\nI doubled the garlic and substituted 1/2 cup of chicken broth for some of the wine. I used Pino Grigio.  I sauteed the onion and garlic until soft, then added the other ingredients and simmered on low to medium heat for about ten minutes before adding the mussels.\n\nOne other tip. We buy mussels by weight, not volume. We find that 3/4 pound per person is a generous portion.\n\nBon appetit!",
