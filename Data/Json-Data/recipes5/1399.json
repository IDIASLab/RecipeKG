Also omitted the garlic and mustard powders. instead of beef bouillon cubes and water I used 1 can of beef broth and 1/2 cup of white wine. Add potatoes and baby carrots for the last hour of cooking and you will get great veges too .Always delish. If you have someone who doesn't think they like pot roast make  this :)",

I used a little less mustard, used white wine as I'm not a fan of red, added 1/2 tablespoon of horseradish sauce to paste mixture and about 1/4 cup of ketchup (as I discovered years ago mixing ketchup and mushroom soup is exactly the same as golden mushroom). I also used reduced fat soup, and cooked in my crock pot on low for about 6 1/2 hours for a 3 lb. roast. Remember when cooking in the crock pot reduce liquids by at least a third.",

I did follow it exactly so that I could assess it fairly. It is an excellent recipe with interesting flavor. I rated it with 5 stars but really it should be 4\u00bd, as I agree with Mousielove that the liquid is a tad salty. I will make it again but next time I will use Lipton's Beefy Onion soup mix instead of the strictly onion soup mix and eliminate the beef bouillon; hopefully that will result in a slightly less salty gravy. But basically the recipe is delicious and everyone at our dinner gathering loved it.",
