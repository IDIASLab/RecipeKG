I also didn't have any Old Bay seasoning, so I mixed another Tblsp of butter and the garlic with some panko breadcrumbs and some seasoned salt, lemon zest and pepper and sprinkled this mixture over the  fish and shrimp.  It was delicious.  Halibut is $10 a pound on sale here in Las Vegas, and I was looking for a recipe that would do it justice.  This was it.  Next time I'll make sure I have all the right ingredients.  Excellent recipe!",

I think there was just simply too much liquid for it to get golden brown the way I like it--I think using just butter and leaving out the wine would have taken care of that. As written, it almost poaches rather than bakes. Not bad, but just average and won't be on my \"make again\" list. Update 8/10/2015:  I just made this again, not realizing I had already tried it and vowed I wouldn't make it again.  Interesting that  the review I prepared this time was virtually the same as the last: Couldn't  give this a more perfect rating for ease of preparation, that's for sure.  One pan, no greasy stove, just lay it all in a pan, dump a few things on it, and bake.  Done.  But - sometimes perfect short cuts  are reflected  with imperfect results, which is the case here.  Because there was too much wine, there really was no \"sauce,\" as others spoke of.  Too much wine prevented the seafood from roasting.  Rather, it just briefly stewed in juices.  Still good, but not the roasted quality with buttery sauce I had hoped for and expected.   Funny thing, you couldn't taste the wine anyway.  If/when I make this again, I'll be sure to use just half the wine called for, if any at all.  As for the quality of the final product in terms of taste and of the degree to which it was done, over or underdone, it was perfection.",
