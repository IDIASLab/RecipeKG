                "reviewBody": "7.31.18 Have to make one recommendation: PLEASE do not simmer your canned clams for 20-25 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Your clams already are cooked so all you need to do is heat them otherwise you ll end up with rubbery chewy clams. Drain the clams and add that juice to the milk/potato mixture early on. When you add the cream at the end that s when I d recommend you add your clams and heat for about 5 minutes.. That s the only change that I made to this recipe and it turned out pretty darn well. Oops I also did add a bit more cayenne (personal taste preference). I could see adding a bay leaf to the milk/potato mixture next time to ramp up the flavor and I'd probably cook a little extra bacon for a serving garnish. It did take quite a bit of the cornstarch slurry to reach the slightly thickened chowder consistency but I had it and it was good. This is an indulgence for me but this creamy flavorful chowder really hit the spot today! Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
