I made up half of the recipe into about one inch thick by about 3 - 4 inch round patties which produced 12 patties. They held together just fine. With the other half of the recipe I made thinner patties. When the thin patties cooled I crumbled them up put the crumbles into an oiled iron skillet dusted them liberally with chili powder and \"scrambled\" them as if they were hamburger meat. (Before I made the thinner patties I tried just putting a gob of the mixture into an oiled iron skillet and scrambling it but it stuck and was a mess.). I then used them like sausage crumbles in some breakfast burritos. I though that the recipe had too much mustard. Next time I will start with about 1/3 cup.",

The taste of the patties are good but because of how long it took to prep/cook it all (and because I had used all my tahini in the patties) I bailed on the sauce altogether and just squeezed some lemons on them in the end which was tasty.
