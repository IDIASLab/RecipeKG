I traded in oil for 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, the brown sugar for Splenda for Baking, and added a banana because the ones I had were pretty small.  Usually when I do this, my muffins come out hard and not as moist as the real recipes, but this one came out just AWESOME!  I also added 3/4 tsp salt, 1 tblsp cinnamon and a small dash of cloves for more flavour.  I will definitely be making this one of my staple recipes.  Never have I made a muffin that tasted so delicious (and I make some at least once a week) and had only healthy ingredients.  I'm so glad you decided to share your recipe!  Thank you!",

I left out the walnuts (my husband hates them) and can't get buttermilk here so I used 2% instead. I had no problem following the instructions except for the fact that the recipe doesn't state exactly when to add the egg sugar oil and vanilla mixture to the rest. Anyway the muffins turned out well and the only reason I'm giving the recipe four stars instead of five is because I think that the texture and taste of the bran would have been better if I had let it soak in the milk for ten minutes as other bran muffin recipes recommend. Also I think I might add a little bit of salt next time. One thing I really like about this recipe though is the banana flavour which really goes well with the bran.",

I used applesauce instead of oil (drain the extra moisture first so it doesn't make your muffins too wet). I also added a 1/2 tsp. salt and extra blueberries. I only had wheat bran so I used that in place of the oat bran. I don't eat a lot of sugar so I thought these were a little too sweet. Next time I might just use 1/2 c. Also don't be afraid to really fill the muffin cups because these don't rise much. I actually made 18 muffins but they were rather small because I didn't fill them very full. Thanks for such a delicious and healthy recipe.",
