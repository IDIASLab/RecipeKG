As 'lively' as the flavor is, it is also great as a winter comfort food. I like to make the chicken just a bit on the spicy side, as when it is served with a side of mildly spiced couscous it mellows just enough. Makes the whole house smell delicious!",

Also, I think there was more than enough rub/paste for the 5 pounder, so if you're doing a 2 1/2 pound chicken as the recipe indicates, you may want ot reduce your rub by half.

Make sure that you use smoked paprika - the plain mccormick stuff will not add anything to the recipe. Also I was out of couscous so I made grits. The only thing that I changed flavor wise was not no duplicate the spices exactly in the grits - I wanted a little variation. I am sure you could add fruits like raisins or cranberries and veggies as well. I will use this spice combination again.",

I liked the couscous but my kids didn't very much maybe it's the texture. So next time I'll substitute it for basmati rice instead (like the restaurant). The spices are just right flavour-wise. As for the amount of spices this recipe makes SunnyByrd is right this will stretch easily to accomodate more chicken. Oh ya I used whole chicken legs instead of the whole chicken and baked them for an hour at the recommended temperature. I also didn't have lemon so used lime instead. Very good I'll most definitely be making this again!",

I rubbed the pieces with some of the spice mixture as instructed and laid them in a large baking dish. Then I added a zucchini summer squash a green pepper and a red onion all cut into large-ish pieces. I also included a box of whole button mushrooms. These I scattered over and around the chicken. Then I dotted the veggies with the remaining spice mix and drizzled them with a little extra olive oil and 1/2 cup chicken broth to prevent scorching. I baked the pan in the oven at 400F for about an hour turning and basting the veggies a couple of times. As the vegetables gave off some water and the chicken gave off its own fat the whole thing cooked evenly and everything was coated with the chili-curry spices. It turned out really delish especially served over the couscous! Worth a try.",

The only changes I made were to use bone-in chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken (because that's what I had) and I was out of onion powder so I used dried onions. I also reduced the cooking time somewhat because of the breasts. I cooked them for an hour but they probably would have been done in about 45 minutes. The seasonings in the couscous weren't too strong so they complimented the chicken and didn't seem too much of the same. I will DEFINITELY make this again!!!",
