The only change I made was to use only 2 T. of the rice wine vinegar AND 2 T. of seasoned rice wine vinegar for a little more sweetness.  Next time I will use all seasoned rice wine vinegar.  I might throw a few more dried cranberries in today\u2019s batch and/or maybe a tiny bit more maple syrup.  Oh, I couldn\u2019t find a Persian cucumber, so I used an English one.  Happy I found this recipe. Will be making this again!",
