Suprisingly, even with the peppers, the meat wasn't spicy enough for us. I think I would increase the jalepenos next time or maybe add some cayenne pepper.  I followed the recipe  except for I had to add salt to the meat mixture. I couldn't imagine cooking meat without it.  I added about a tablespoon of salt and some black pepper.  I started my meat out frozen.  I accidentally cooked on high 3 hours longer than I was supposed to when I fell asleep!  I cut back on the low temp. time by 3 hours due to this mistake. The meat was very tender. For us,the taste was a 3 and ease was a 4. If you don't like things too spicy it should be perfect as is.  Thanks for sharing it.",

I used a shorter cooking time (12 hours) because a 4-pound shoulder is about the max from my supermarket. I also used less liquid with that smaller shoulder roast but I stayed with the full 1-cup measure of cumin. ( ALWAYS leave the lid on a crock-pot. Don't stir it or peek just to see if its working. It is. Muster your will power! ) Chili peppers lose their heat with longer cooking also when seeded. I add them near the end maybe leave in the seeds if I really want heat. Or put out a bowl of minced jalapenos for people to sprinkle to taste. This Pico deGallo is top-drawer. Use it often. In place of salsas and other dips. Try this Pico for quesadillas.",
