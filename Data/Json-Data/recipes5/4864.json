This recipe in combination with some techniques learned through other recipes proved the winning combination. Thanks Magdalinka! I ended up using the proportions in this recipe but I made a flour mix with roughly 1 part brown rice flour: 1 part almond flour: 1 part tapioca flour. Also after I cut in the butter I put the dry ingredients and butter mixture into the freezer for 10 minutes. I then added the liquid mixture slowly while stirring. I didn't use the ginger or lemon zest and this may be why the flavor is a bit bland at first but it matures so nicely on the tongue and leaves you wanting more! I did find the lemon to be an important and subtle flavoring. It doesn't give them a lemony flavor but adds depth and interest to the butteriness! Tomorrow I plan to make them again and play around with adding currants berries and white chocolate!",

Prep for this took me closer to 45-50 min. Also once I was mixing everything together the dough got really grainy. It fell apart and stuck to my fingers. A little extra flour helped a little. Rather than one round cut into wedges I made 8 balls and pressed them and then had enough left for a round that cut into 4 wedges. I ended up with 12 scones in the end. They bake pretty flat. They taste pretty good though.",

I had to sub the rice flour (because i didn't want to buy a whole pack and not use it) with whole wheat flour. I also had some goat milk that expired soon so i used that as the milk. If you really love ginger (like me) put in about 1 1/2 cups and a little extra lemon juice to balance it. You must also flour everything when you are kneading it because it is SUPER sticky. Great recipie!!",
