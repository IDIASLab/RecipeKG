While of love eggs on their own, I do not like the spongy texture they give meatballs. The one thing that I did not like about the recipe was the tomatoes. They never broke down into smaller more manageable size. I would use crushed or diced next time. I did need to add more liquid before adding the noodles but overall a good recipe.",
