I use 1/2 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice and a 'glug' of white wine, plus Italian parsley. Make sure you add the garlic only after you add the lemon juice/wine. Otherwise if you saute it with the shrimp, it will burn and there is nothing worse than burned garlic. For the pasta, I  have made it with angel hair, regular spaghetti, and linguine and prefer linguine over all the others. It stays separated and doesnt turn into a big pasta glob. I also add several thin slices of lemon and fresh grated parmesan for presentation. It is absolutely one of my favorite dishes to make and only takes a few minutes to cook. It is excellent! Note: dont skip the step of soaking your shrimp in the salt water. It cleans them really well resulting in very fresh tasting shrimp.",

I used frozen, raw, peeled & deveined shrimp which the package touted was \"prepared with sea salt,\" so I thought that was good enough!  For the sauce, I did cut the butter back a little and only used 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes (plenty hot for us!).  I also added 1/2 tsp. kosher salt.  For the lemon juice and zest, it's basically the juice and zest of one lemon.  I served this over whole wheat spaghetti.  It was excellent and I highly recommend this recipe!",

Gave enough body to cling well to the Pasta...Oh and I only used 8 oz. of Pasta vs. the #1 Suggested. Did not have fresh shrimp used frozen still very good, and cayenne pepper...no flake on hand....also only had orzo pasta and it went well....Trust this recipe and Bon Apetite!",

I was worried that the thin-as-water sauce would cause angel hair pasta (nearly 1/2 a box) to taste 'watered-down' when tossed in pan of sauce & shrimp, but it didn't (was delicious), so added the remaining cooked pasta.  Used 1.5# frozen raw 31/40 count shrimp (and ingredient measurements as recipe stated for 2# of shrimp).  We're fans of garlic so next time I'll use 4-5T because 3T didn't 'stand-out' for us.  Brined in sea salt for five hours, but didn't notice a difference between brining or not brining---however we rarely cook shrimp so I wouldn't know good from better ;^)  Used 2T butter and a liberal drizzle of olive oil--both were more than enough so next time I'll use even less.  Now that I know what to expect from/flavours of this dish...in the future I'll add veggies such as snow peas, thinly sliced bell pepper (red, orange, or yellow--green may be too tough/strong in flavour)and/or swiss chard in lieu of parsley.  As stated in review preceding mine...the lemon zest and juice was one lemon.",
