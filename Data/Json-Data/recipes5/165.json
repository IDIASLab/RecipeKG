I browned 4 chicken breasts and added 3 Cups of stock. because I ve run into my IP getting the burn function without more than 2C of liquid. I kept the times as written and when I opened the pot some of the noodles were hard but once I added the heavy cream and sour cream they softened up. I did not have enough liquid to use the cornstarch so next time I ll add 4C of stock and then use the cornstarch. The sauce was delicious. I ll make this again!",
