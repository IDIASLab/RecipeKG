This is the squash's natural texture when baked...cool, huh? It's not only beautiful but absolutely delicious. Spaghetti squash has a slight sweetness that complements any savory flavors you stuff into it. Top each half with a pinch of red pepper flakes and chopped parsley, if desired. Serve hot.",
