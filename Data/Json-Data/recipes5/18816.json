I only made a couple of changes; added few extra bay leaves (dried), extra peppercorns and added a teaspoon of fennel seeds in place of the coriander.  I changed the proportion of vinegar:sugar a little, cutting back on the vinegar - and thought it was a little too sweet at first, but found that the vinegar seemed more pronounced the next day.  A friend made the same recipe & put in the whole amount of vinegar, finding it a little too acidic, so it might be an idea to just add 1 & 1/2 cups.  On a whole, there was so much flavour in this!  All you need is soft bread to soak up the marinade - it's so good.",

I've made this 2x -- first time exactly as written and 2nd time with a few changes. It seems to me that in the Cape pickled fish is lightly battered and fried. I wanted to cut down on the oil and fat so rather than frying the fish I grilled it under the broiler until just cooked. I like the sauce as written except I agree that the vinegar was a bit much. I used 1 1/2 cups and thought that was still a bit strong. I think I should have upped the brown sugar a bit to balance the flavor.",

Tip: if you need it same day fry the fish 2 minutes each side set aside and pour the curry/pickle sauce in the pan and bring to a light simmer and place the fish back in spooning sauce over the fish. Let it all low poach for 5 minutes. a dash or two of Peri Peri or Tabasco sauce works well if you don't have a red chile pepper.",
