I do add a little of unsweetened grated coconut to give this chutney some body from time to time. A few mint leaves also enhance the flavor. I also add 1/4 tsp of sugar. I love to smother my toast with this chutney and it gives me a welcome and spicy break from all the sweet breakfast dishes like pancakes, cereals, etc. You may want to avoid this if it has garlic though!! Great recipe! As for kids: only Indian and Mexican kids and kids from countries where the cuisine is normally fairly spicy will venture near this recipe!!",
