At 15 minutes I removed the cookies because they seemed \u201cset\u201d. However,  after they sat for a little while I tried to move one and it fell apart, was not completely baked. I put them back in for another five minutes. So I would suggest baking them longer, maybe the toothpick method would work? I won\u2019t know until I try again. Putting cookies back in after they have been out for a little while is not some thing I would normally do; but, it worked and I don\u2019t think it affected the quality of the cookies as our guests  requested a copy of the recipe. I will definitely be making them again! Thank you for this alternative recipe to a high calorie cookie!",
