Also I put the bacon the freezer for a few minutes to firm it up to make cutting it easier, just a personal preference but otherwise without doing that the heat from my hands melted the bacon fat and it was harder to pull apart slices for each cracker.   I'll make this again and again....after about 45 minutes in the oven at 250F, upped it to 300F, watched carefully and then broiled them for a couple minutes to get any remaining sugar to melt and caramelize.",
