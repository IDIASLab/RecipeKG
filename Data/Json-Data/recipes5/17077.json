I was only making 2 slices for me, and when I reduced the servings to 2 it said to use 2/3 eggs, but I was having problems with that so I just used 1 egg.

They fiddle and fuss and screw around and somehow- somehow- it's never as good as the stuff they get at that little place down the street. \n\nWell. Having worked for a succession of little places down the street? This is the sort of recipe they use. Simple, made fresh and a la moment. \n\nIn fact, with the addition of a splash of orange extract and a coating of Panko crumbs before frying, this is so close to the recipe for which I used to get raves- and which travelled with me through three kitchens- as to be indistinquishable. Good stuff- brown and crunchy on the outside, rich and custardy inside.\n\nI would suggest using French bread- supermarket variety is fine- and using any left overs to make a first class grilled ham and cheese for lunch.
