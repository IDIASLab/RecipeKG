It's easy to double, and people always ask for the recipe so have extras on hand! I prefer fresh tomatoes, but the recipe calls for canned. You can also substitute any fruit to adjust it to your tastes. If you have a food processor or mini chopper, this recipe is much quicker and easier. Serve with Tostitos&reg; Scoops!&reg; chips. Enjoy!",

The sweetness of the cantaloupe contrasts perfectly with the heat of the jalape\u00f1os and the pungent lemon and lime juices.  This would be great on tortilla chips, but it was awesome on grilled chicken breasts today.",

Substituted parsley from my garden for the cilantro which I did not have, 1 small green pepper from my garden. Again because I did not have yellow pepper on hand. Also substituted hot cherry peppers from my garden as I did not have jalapeno peppers. I also substituted fresh cherry tomatoes for the canned diced tomatoes and cut them in half Did not use garlic as we were going out and did not want \"garlic breath\". Otherwise, I probably would have used a small clove. I also cut back to 1 Tbsp. of the lemon, and lime juice because I did not have that much cantaloupe. I used this salsa over baked codfish and it really was delicious.",
