One cup at a time, I added the whole wheat flour, rye flour, and 1 cup bread flour.  I then kneaded in the last cup just until the bread was smooth and elastic(it did not take the full last cup).  This has a great texture and  was super easy to make.  It made two medium sized loaves.",

This is a keeper recipe. \n\nI do not use a bread machine, but use a kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook.  I did not have any oil but olive on hand, so I used 1/4 c of butter.  I heated all the liquid ingredients including the butter to 140 degrees(my house is cold right now, including the metal mixing bowl).  I put one package of the rapid rise yeast in with the brown sugar, king arthur's w.w. flour, rye flour, salt, mixed it up with the dough hook, and then poured in the liquid.  Mixed it well and grdually added the remaining bread flour. I kneaded the dough with the mixer.  I let the dough rest while I cleaned up maybe ten minutes.  I then pulled the dough off the dough hook and shaped it into a ball, put it in a greased aluminum pie pan and let it rise to double in bulk.  I brushed it with egg and put the oatmeal on top.  Baked it for 35 minutes.  It was wonderful.",

You should probably be aware of whether or not you like this kind of dark bread before you try to make it however.

My husband gave it five stars as well, and it was the first recipe of many that I have tried from this site that I have bothered to review.  Thanks again for the recipe.",

I am giving it four stars only because by following the recipe as written the dough came out of my bread machine very sticky and I had to knead in another 1/2 C of flour by hand to make it workable. I think this affected the flavor and texture of the bread somewhat. I plan to make another batch very soon and I think I will just let it bake in the bread machine (as it doesn't care whether or not the dough's sticky.;) Perhaps without so much extra flour and handling the flavor/texture will be closer to what I was hoping for. All in all a great recipe though thanks very much for posting it.",

I did give it an egg wash and a sprinkling of oatmeal before I baked it. It came out looking beautiful. The flavor is more of a wheat/rye combination and a dense loaf.
