My modifications: 1) I whisked all the ingredients plus salt pepper and basil together in the glass pot that I was going to bake the chicken in thus I had one less dish to clean. 2) I used an entire lemon because I love on obscene amount of lemon. 3) I used less honey. 4) Instead of basting which is too much work for a quick and dirty dinner night I just stabbed the budgeezus out of the chicken with a fork and covered the pot to keep the juices in. This way it only took 30 minutes to cook. It turned out lovely and lemony and it required very little work! A",

This locked in the moisture as well as the taste of the marinade. Sometimes skinless breasts can be relatively tasteless or overpowered by the marinade but this ended up being a nice balance of the flavor of the moist and tender chicken and the flavors of the marinade (although Mrs. Spunky Buddy thought it was too lemony-tangy).",

Also 45 mins is way too long for chicken breasts. Thirty minutes is usually perfect. The chicken would be much better if it was marinated in the sauce for several hours and then grilled instead of baked in the oven. The baked chicken didn't have much color to it and therefore didn't look that appetizing. Another change I would highly recommend is doubling the liquid. It could also benefit from salt and pepper.",

The honey will burn if you don't have the chicken packed tight in the baking dish so I don't recommend making a single serving like I did. A bit of salt and pepper garlic powder and a touch more honey could turn this into a fabulous dish. Will make again!",
