The chipotle peppers in adobo sauce really add some kick to the sauce. It gets a little warmer the longer it sits. I used this on 'The Best Baby Back Ribs You'll EVER Eat' a personal recipe of Christina. My DS loves this sauce and has used the leftover sauce on everything i.e.: brats hamburgers baked beans pork chops. He wants me to make him a batch before going back to college this fall.

I added 1/2 cup whiskey and used my own brown sugar recipe as well as home made spicy mustard. I added more vinegar to make up for the lack of salt and some tang I like. I skipped the liquid smoke all-together as it sounded excessive and the peppers had plenty of smokiness. I added black pepper and a dash of crushed red. No salt. I will cut the sugar back a bit next time - possibly use apple juice in place of the whiskey just to try it. I cooked it until thick and it darkened up. It is delicious and very spicy - but we like hot. The recipe is amendable and you can taste and adjust along the way. I used on BSCB but think it would be great on ribs or on a pulled pork sandwich. Everyone loved it and will add this to our list of staples!",
