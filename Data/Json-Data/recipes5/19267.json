I used 1 tbsp of olive oil supplemented with olive oil cooking spray rather than the peanut and sesame oils. I left out the cornstarch and just cooked the pork in the olive oil. I didn't have broccoli, so I used a green pepper, a red pepper, and an onion, all sliced. Oh, and I had 1.5 pounds of pork tenderloin, so I used it all. \n\nI left the sauce unchanged (except used splenda brown sugar blend instead of brown sugar); it is delicious as written. My husband loved it even though he doesn't normally like sweet foods, and our three male guests raved about it.\n\nI served it with a basic fried rice (3 cups cooked white rice, 1 egg, 3 tablespoons each of soy sauce and rice vinegar, all fried up together with olive oil).",

I liked it much better without the soy sauce- it makes the sauce much darker with a salty undertone. It was OK but not nearly as good as the first time when I left it out. I have revised my rating to reflect this. 5 stars without the soy sauce- 3 stars with it. FIRST RATING (made without soy sauce): This recipe may be simple and quick but it's just delicious! The sauce is probably the easiest stir fry sauce I have ever made but it is also the best with wonderful texture flavor and coverage. The only change I made was to add salt and pepper to the meat before cooking it but that is minor. I had some carrots on hand so chopped them into a fine julienne and served this dish over basmati rice. It will certainly be something I make again in the future. Thanks so much!",
