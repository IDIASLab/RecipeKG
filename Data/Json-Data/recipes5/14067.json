I could not find pequin chiles so after reading up about them and their heat level I decided to just double the serranos and jalapenos.

                "reviewBody": "I thought I had messed this up cause I read the ingredient list first prepared everything including unhusking the tomatillos as that is what the ingredient list says. Then when I got ready to cook I saw that the directions say to remove the husks AFTER dry roasting. That said I went ahead anyway and followed the rest of the directions. The result was amazing. Im sure it is easier to remove the husks first so I would definately do that next time anyway. This salsa verde was pretty much perfect! It will be my go to recipe from now on. I couldn't fint pequin peppers so like many other reviewers I added double the amount of jalapeno and serrano peppers. The result wasn't hot enough for our tastes so I will adjust for that next time. One cooking note: The garlic and serranos will blacken much faster than the tomatillos and jalapenos. Next time I will add them in stages as garlic does tend to become bitter if overcooked and it would have been charcoal if I had left it in for as long as the rest. I had to fish around and remove half way through. I removed the tomatillos when the skins were blackened just as they were splitting. Great recipe wonderful authentic flavor. I have a very happy and impressed husband! Thanks!",

My husband is mexican- we've discovered that serrano peppers often give a better flavor than jalapenos alone in general. Also if you want to avoid the chile haze in your house you can roast the ingredients on the grill. Just dont lose your serranos and garlic through the grates! Use aluminum foil or a pan. For a delicious milder version of green salsa you can use all or part poblano peppers which are traditionally peeled after roasting. Dunk them in ice water to help loosen the skins and don't stress out if you can't get it all.",
