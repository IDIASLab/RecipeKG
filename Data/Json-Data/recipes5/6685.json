        "description": "I've made potato-basil gnocchi before and successfully frozen it but thought I'd try the gnocchi less travelled... gnudi. Gnudi are ricotta-based gnocchi, and are usually made with spinach. However, I forgot to buy spinach and thought I'd use up some of my bumper crop of basil. These are delicate, delicious, and surprisingly easy. The recipe is very forgiving. The basil is intense and wonderful with these little cheese dumplings. I used a mix of both Genovese and Amethyst basil and the results were purple and green! Serve with butter, pesto, or chopped fresh tomatoes, capers and olives as either a main course or a side dish",

What I used was last year's bumper crop of basil that I had put in the freezer. Once it's frozen, I crush it until it crumbles, that way I can add it to sauces and other recipes throughout the winter. I used about 1/2 cup of the crushed frozen basil, and it worked perfect! I just threw it right in with the ricotta cheese (didn't even wait for it to thaw) and then carried on with the recipe. These were light and pillow-y, and worked great in the recipe that I was making tonight (Chicken Sausage Gnocchi Skillet, also from this site). I will be saving this to my recipe box, and can't wait to make them again!",

As a first timer I wasn\u2019t sure the consistency gnudi should be and seeing as my ricotta was watery I did add extra flour. Workable yet still sticky. This probably only took me 20 minutes, I just did a brown butter sauce, so flavorful! Thank you!",

To save time I piped the ricotta into a gallon bag snipped the corner and squeezed and cut small pieces as it came out of the bag directly into boiling water. I used low sodium chicken broth with my boiling water. When the gnocchi was done I placed it on a paper towel liner plate. To complete the dish I pan fried ham in butter added peas and fresh pesto. I also pan fried the gnocchi to golden brown in that process ( I don t like mushy gnocchi). It was delicious. I topped with more Parmesan and fresh parsley.",

Cook's Illustrated has a good recipe that are fluffier.\n\nWord to the wise: the quantities in the directions of the recipe don't scale when you change the number of servings, so you need to do the math on your own for the flour.",
