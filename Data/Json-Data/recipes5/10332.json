I followed the instructions closely and watched the video twice. I can't imagine what went wrong. Not only did the recipe not yield much gravy (nowhere the amount suggested) but the gravy was also rather unexciting. I highly advise against this recipe. It's so much work and you get so little - both in quantity and taste - in return.",
