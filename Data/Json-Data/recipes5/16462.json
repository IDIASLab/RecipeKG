Overall I think I followed it pretty much as written (scaled to half) but I didn't actually measure the pineapple and cranberry. I would make it again but maybe mix the pineapple and cranberry sauce before pouring over the apples to help break up the cranberry sauce and make it more spreadable. I think coconut would be a good addition too!",

I was intrigued with the combination of red apples pineapple and cranberry sauce and could not phantom what the ending taste would be. It tasted tart sweet and sour and with the toping it became crunchy. I debated on peeling the apples but am glad that I did not. I served this as a side for breakfast. It would make a beautiful and festive addition to any brunch buffet holiday meal or with the addition of ice cream it would make a tasty dessert. Thanks Eleanor Johnson for sharing and for AR Member Don for nominating this recipe as the AR Recipe Group selection.",
