I didn't have any flank steak on hand so I substituted skirt steaks which are usually a fairly chewy cut. After marinating for just 2 hours you could practically cut them with a fork. I served them to company and everyone raved. The blend of flavors was excellent with just a hint of sweet and a little tang of lemon to offset it. One word of caution: this makes ALOT of marinade. I served four and could have cut the recipe in half. Definitely a keeper!",

I have other recipes using port wine with beef that I really love. The citrus juices tenderized the meat nicely which is important for this cut. You can easily scale in half since it makes way more than you'll need. For a very decadent treat try topping it with a blue cheese/butter/chive mixture after it comes off the grill. Very nice!",
