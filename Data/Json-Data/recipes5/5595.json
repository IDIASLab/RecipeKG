I made the dressing earlier in the day omitting the egg (I just couldn't lol) but adding in a little extra olive oil...the flavors fo the dressing are fantastic. Also I forgot to buy croutons at the store so I made my own which made this that much better. Loved the mushrooms and bacon in this as well. I think maybe next time I would add some fresh grated parm. cheese but other than that this was wonderful YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
