I did, however, change a few things about the recipe that I believe solved many of the problems listed in other reviews.  I used canned peaches in heavy syrup, so I gently rinsed them off, so it wouldn't be so sweet.  I crushed my vanilla wafers to a flour like consistency and made my crumb mixture like I usually make any crumb topping.  After putting the peaches in a baking dish and sprinkling on the topping, I baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 10 min.  The peaches were nice and warm, so I served it with a scoop of ice cream!  This version does take a little bit longer, but the extra 10 or 15 minutes is worth it, I believe.",

I would rate the taste a 3 or 4; but after working a 12 hour shift as a nurse and being able to have peach crisp in 5 minutes was fantastic!  I used 3 fresh peaches and microwaved for one minute to soften and warm as other reviewers suggested.  I then broiled with the topping and ate it with Cool Whip.  The perfect quick dessert!  I wouldn't serve this to company and it's not as delicious as real peach crisp but it is very simple, quick and tasty  & im my opinion worthy of 5 stars.  Thanks Chandra!",

The peaches turned out warm and soft with the sweet crunchy topping. This literally took only 5 minutes to make and served 4 people. Would also be good served with ice cream or whipped cream.
