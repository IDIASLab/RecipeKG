I cut open the sausages and used the meat. Keep in mind the sausages are already seasoned and salted as well so go easy if you're adding salt at the end. The pinch of brown sugar is something I always add to my sauce which I find helps reduce the acidity of the tomatoes and paste a little. It's sitting on the stove on low as I'm writing this and I highly recommend giving it a try! Excellent recipe!",
