The first batch of cookies flattened too much, but after the batter had sat for about 10 minutes, it thickened nicely and the cookies were perfect. I used a 2 tbsp. mini ice cream scoop so they'd be the same size, and I had no problems with them keeping a funky shape while baking. They smoothed out perfectly. I used a different filling: 1 large tub Cool Whip, 8 oz cream cheese, 2/3 cup sugar and 2 tsp. vanilla, whipped together. It was light, not too rich. The flavor of the pies was much better after they rested overnight. MAKE THIS RECIPE. You won't be disappointed. ",

Everyone loves them because they are not overly sweet but are super moist. I always add a little extra cloves or \"baking spice\" to make them extra spicy just because that is the way I like them. If you beat your egg white until stiff peaks form the frosting is even fluffier. It is true that they turn out pretty much how they are put onto the cookie sheet so using a piping bag (or a ziploc bag with the corner cut off) will result in a smoother cookie top. I have never tried the cream cheese filling but I would think it would be too rich. The best part about this recipe is you can eat more than one because they are not icky sweet.",

When trying a new recipe I always do a trial run with only a few cookies to see how long to bake space apart on the cookie sheet etc. My first batch appeared to be done but then the cookies fell and I realized they were underdone. The rest of them came out perfectly. I used a regular cookie dough scoop and the cookies looked great. With the icing make sure to beat your egg white at a high setting for about 10 minutes. I added just a touch of cream of tartar to it during this stage. The icing took about 15 minutes to make and I had some left over. The cookies are not too sweet which makes them so enjoyable.

I used the EggBeaters eggwhites instead of regular eggs and they worked great. One problem I had with the pumpkin part though was it ended up very sticky so I couldn't wrap them and eating them left chunks on the fingers. Something else to bear in mind these don't really spread out so whatever shape you plop them onto the pan in is the shape your cookies will have. But the cream filling? Fabulous especially for someone that isn't keen on exceedingly sweet things.",
