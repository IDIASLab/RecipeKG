I had red bell pepper instead of green and that enhanced the overall flavor too!  I used a half large red pepper, chopped.  8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack with jalapeno pepper,  2 ounces  shredded Parmigianno Reggiano, and 6 ounces  shredded Sharp Cheddar.  The rest of the recipe  was kept as is.  The flavor of this casserole was scrumptious and truly outstanding.   This is definitely my go-to recipe for our left over ham!  I will make it exactly as I did with the substituted cheeses as I did the first time as the flavor was amazing!",
