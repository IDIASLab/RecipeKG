After I had experimented with and tweaked several sorrel soup recipes, my 88-year-old father-in-law declared it tasted like his mom made back in Poland - the ultimate compliment! It doesn't look like much, but is it ever tasty and filling. Use fresh sorrel in the spring, when the leaves are most tender. Top each serving with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle with your favorite fresh herbs - parsley, dill, or cilantro. Serve with crusty bread or hearty biscuits.",

I received a bunch of sorrel in my Farm Share this week and wasn't sure how to use it. This soup was a real winner. could be adapted to any type of greens I would think.",
