Dill seed would give this an altogether different flavor similar to caraway seed - so that's what I used fresh dill WEED. Baking this for an hour wasn't necessary and perhaps not even advised. Once the onion and rice were browned I added the water and cooked it on the stovetop in the conventional manner covered and simmered for about 20 minutes. Hubs and I enjoyed this. It had a fresh delicate flavor of lemon and dill which was the ideal complement to the fish I served with it.",

The moisture content is incredible and it goes amazingly well with lemon chicken. The flavors of the onion and lemon make the dish pop and will definitely have people asking how u made it!!!",
