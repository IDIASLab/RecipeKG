We tripled the green onion to really have the flavor come out otherwise it would have been a bit bland. But with the additional green onion it was wonderful. We have salad every night with dinner and this will make a nice addition to our repertoire especially during the spring and summer months. Edited to add: We've since had this several times in the last month. I still recommend lots of green onion. I've started adding a couple TBSP of orange juice and some orange zest to really bring out the flavor of the dressing. With these changes I'd bump up my rating from a 4 to a 5. We also toss on some flavored almond slivers to complete the salad. Yummm!",
