I  tripled it so I could feed the whole crew and did use the Rao's Tomato and Basil Sauce - it's pretty pricey but low in carbs and absolutely yummy.  Used my food processor to make the \"breading\".  Just pulsed everything together.  I made the whole dish a couple of hours ahead of time and put in oven at 350 covered for 20 mins or so until the chicken came back up to temp and then removed the foil and turned the oven up to broil (low) until the cheese was nice and bubbly.  Served with zoodles sauteed in lemon infused olive oil and a cesar salad (minus the croutons).  This one is a keeper.",

I calculated the macros and it comes out to be less than 4 grams of carbs per chicken breast.
