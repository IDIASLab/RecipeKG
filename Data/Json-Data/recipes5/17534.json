First off - I noticed that the recipe was not clear about whether to add the broth that the pork is cooked in to the sweet and sour sauce or not.  So I only added 1/2 cup of the broth and balanced it out with a bit more cornstarch (1 tsp) - this gave a nice thick consistency.  I also only used one can of pineapple tidbits and used pineapple juice instead of another can (1 cup juice plus the juice from the can of pineapple).  There's only so much pineapple a person can take...  It turned out well and everyone liked it!",

                "reviewBody": "Made this for dinner tonigght and have just a few problems with it. First off the sauce is very runny not as thick as the description would lead you to believe. I even cut the pineapple juice to 2 1/4 cans instead of 3. I used flour as a thickener instead of cornstarch because I didn't have any on hand and I used 2 tablespoons instead of 1. Also increased brown sugar to 1 cup. Secondly 3 cans of pineapple was way too much. I used just 2 cans and that was plenty for us. Finally I'm not crazy about soy sauce but I was afraid if I left it out it would take something away from the flavor of the sauce. Just 3 tablespoons was enough for the soy sauce to be too overpowering for my taste. I would recommend leaving it out if you don't like it. I also decreased the vinegar to 1/2 cup because we tend to like sweet and sour sauce more on the sweet side. Overall the sauce was good and the pork was very tender and moist.",
