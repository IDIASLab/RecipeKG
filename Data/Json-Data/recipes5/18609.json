I want to thank you for sharing this recipe!! it is the now the meatloaf by which all other meatloafs will be measured.",

First off I doubled the recipe because I had 2.lbs of ground beef I didn't have any bell pepper or celery Here are my Substitutions: 2 eggs for eggbeaters 1/4 cup soy sauce for 1/4 worcestershire Dried basil/parsley/oregano/ for meatload seasoning mix garlic powder for garlic salt ADDED: 1 beef boullion cube 1tbsp of liquid smoke to loaf. For sauce: I also reduced the brown sugar to 2tbsp I also doubled the sauce and glazed twice while baking and was perfect. Because it was a 2.lb loaf I baked at 375 for 1hr 15-30min. It turned out very good and didn't fall apart. I want to try this next time with ground turkey...Yummy!!!",
