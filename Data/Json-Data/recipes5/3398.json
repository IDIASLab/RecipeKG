I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I also made a pan sauce of the drippings and the garlic butter to pour over the tenderloins.

I wasted a very expensive large tail for this recipe. Yet it does make for a great presentation so in the future I will make it again but use some sort of \"fake\" lobster for the stuffing. I also feel the cooking times are much too long for my desired medium-rare. Since all ovens are different use the suggested oven temp setting but use a high quality meat thermometer to closely monitor.",
