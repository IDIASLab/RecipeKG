I few things to mention though...you do have to cook them longer than the recipe states (about 45 minutes for us) and it's important that you use a really big (preferrably shallow) baking dish to allow the sauce to spread out.  If your dish is too small, the chestnuts will just boil in the sauce resulting in limp bacon.",

I marinated the water chestnuts for a 1/2 before wrapping them in the bacon. It gave them  more flavor. Then i used the marinade to baste them before cooking. Draining the fat off during cooking time helped alot too.",

Speaking of toothpicks the suggestion someone made about soaking them first was a good one. I baked them for a 1/2 hour the night before which was a great time-saver. I found it took another 1/2 hour to get them to the desired 'done-ness'. I did what others suggested and halved the brown sugar and it too was a good move. Ten people devoured about 70 of these in no time flat with lots of other hors d'oeuvres to eat as well so judge yourself accordingly. I can't imagine how many I'd have to make in order to have leftovers!!",

I doubled the batch and didn't have any left! I followed the recipe pretty closely but I did add a few squirts of Sriracha Hot Chile Sauce to give it a bit of heat (just add to your taste). I only used half a strip of bacon to wrap the waterchestnut. I baked them longer until the bacon was crispy. Then I dipped them in the sauce and baked again for 10-15 longer so that the sauce was more of a glaze. I did not double the sauce the amount of sauce was plenty even though I doubled the amount of waterchestnuts/bacon I used. I also soaked the toothpicks in water so they didn't burn or turn dark brown. I served them in a crock pot set on low to keep them warm. Since then I have received constant requests for me to make these again!",
