I eliminated the mustard, and added some white wine.  In my mind, this recipe is way too heavy  on the  lemon, so  I eliminated the lemon zest completely  and just gave the chicken  a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice once it had browned.  With flavors I'm accustomed to and love, there was no way this dish could go wrong  (as long as you hold back on the lemon).  I served this with \"Summer Penne Pasta,\" another AR recipe.",
