They lend a subtle flavor that elevates the dish beautifully while still keeping it simple. Have to admit that I forgot to add sour cream and Dijon (it'd been a really long day) but we loved it anyway. Know the difference those ingredients will make and plan on making again In its entirety. My apologies to review traditionalists but hope to update in near future.",
