I used less oil (about 3/4 c.), less cheese (about half of recipe) and no anchovies (yeck).  I didn't have any sour cream so I used a splash of buttermilk.  I put in 1/4 c. olive oil into the blender first to 'catch' the rest of the ingredients, chucked everything else in and I did drizzle the last of the olive oil in while the blender was on.  I dressed the romaine with it and added sauted greek chicken on top--all cold for a really hot day.  WoW!  My husband (v fussy) DEVOURED it and came home the next night saying 'I'm craving that salad again!'  (Good thing I had more!)  Will definitely do this again and am bringing some over to a friend.  =-)   ",
