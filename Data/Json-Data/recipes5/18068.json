I don't like crock pots much everything comes out wet and floating in liquid. I put them in a big baking pan and baked them at 350\u00ba for about an hour. It worked great. I prefer baked beans to be thick not swimming in juice. I used two 32 ounce cans of Van Camps regular pork and beans and drained the excess juice off the top of the cans. I used pork sausage instead of hamburger and it was so good. I cooked the onions with the sausage when I browned it. Fantastic baked beans!",
