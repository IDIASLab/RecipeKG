I also added 2 T. of taco seasoning mix. I used Chubby's BBQ Sauce so I did not add any brown sugar because the sauce is sweet enough. Will definitely make again.",

It had so much flavor and tasted really fresh using fresh jalapeno and cilantro. My ground chicken and pork came in 1 lb. containers. I noticed that other reviewers used an entire lb. of pork so I did to so I didn't have and extra 1/2 lb that I probably wouldn't use. I added a full 2 tbs. of taco seasoning and 16 oz. salsa to accomodate for the extra pork. I left everything else the same. So so yummy! It was moist and cooked perfectly in the time listed on the recipe. I will definitely be making again. Thanks HockeyMom!",

Because of this the resulting loaf was a little sweeter but still incredibly yummy. Next time I'll try to spice it up by using hot salsa instead of the mild I had on hand.
