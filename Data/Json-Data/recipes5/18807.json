I will drain the pineapple in a sieve for 30 minutes or so next time as merely draining in the can leaves too much leftover juice making the pineapple hard to work with and adding too much liquid to bottom of roaster. Otherwise very good and not too sweet at all. note to self: Cooked 8.5 lb ham at 325 (same temp and time as potatoes) for a little over 2 hours. Took foil off after first hour and basted occasionally. Easter 2008 - Served with Scalloped Potatoes and Onions and Gulliver's Creamed Corn both from here. Also served fresh asparagus mashed sweet potato and pear and creamy coleslaw. Everything worked very well together.",

Just a word to the wise, don't expect the juices to be able to be thickened into any kind of sauce or glaze. ",

I also patted on a little more brown sugar on top of the pineapple. It turned out DELICIOUS!! The taste was perfect!! Definitely not too salty.

Instead of the milk I scored the ham and poured 1 12oz can of Pepsi Throwback (real sugar) all over the ham. I was prepared to use more but that was all the 9x13 could safely hold. From there I followed the recipe by packing on the brown sugar (I used dark for more molasses flavor) and then the crushed pineapple. I used a 10lb ham and it could really only hold 2 cans of the pineapple. I put the foil on so as to help keep the 'coatings' and even secured it with a few toothpicks. I let it sit overnight as directed. The next day I put the foil-covered ham in the oven @350F for 30min but realized that people weren't going to want to eat in the next 30 min. So I reduced the time to 275F and baked it for 4 to 4 1/2 more hours basting with the juices every 100 min. or so (that's as high as my timer would go!) I checked it with the meat thermometer to be sure and it was good to go. I was worried it might be too sweet but it was great (and I don't particularly care for ham). We cut it a little on the thick side like a ham steak and you didn't even need a knife. My husband and dad loved it!",
