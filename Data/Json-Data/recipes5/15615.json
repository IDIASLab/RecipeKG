The only suggestions I might add is to add a bit of milk to the processed cheese sauce in the jar and add salsa and jalapenos to the mix. I top off my nachos with sour cream and green onions. This is definitely an meal for sports night or for a kids party or to use as a party dip. Just good stuff! Note: if you prefer to use fresh or block processed cheese instead of jar cheese you can use mild cheddar/american/provolone mixed a mexican cheese blend or block processed cheese like velveeta and mix it with 1 cup of milk and it comes out great.",

I used two cans of nacho sauce one pound of ground beef one packet of taco seasoning half of an onion one can of tomatoes and chilies and 1/4 tsp of chili powder. I also went ahead and drained the ground beef (there was plenty of grease left in the pan). I used a big pot instead of a slow cooker and it was fine. I didn't add water since we like our dip thick and hearty. It was REALLY good; we had ours in individual soup bowls and used flour tortillas and nacho chips for dipping. We added chopped green onions on top. The only thing missing was sour cream (didn't have any). We had more than enough dip--enough for lunch the next day. Just in case anyone's interested I would say I got enough dip to feed 4 nacho lovers as a main course and 6-8 as a snack. Yummy yum YUM!! Thanks Slim!!!!!!!!!!",

Make sure you drain your tomatoes really good I didn't and my cheese sauce was a little runny. It didn't look like cheese sauce but it was tasty.
