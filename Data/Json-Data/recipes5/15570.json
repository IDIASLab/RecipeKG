This is how I changed it up the second time to account for our family's taste & we all thought it was OUTSTANDING! I used 2 lb ground turkey which I seasoned w/garlic powder, pepper & cilantro, substituted a can of tomatoes w/green chiles for the diced tomatoes, used 2 packages taco seasoning, omitted the water & used 1/2 cup salsa instead, used 2 packages Jiffy corn muffin mix & mixed the corn in with the mix.  Put a very thin layer of the corn bread mix on the bottom, then layered as directed, throwing in a layer of shredded taco/mexican cheese before topping w/the remainder of the corn bread mix.  Garnished w/fresh chopped tomatoes, green onions, black olives & non-fat sour cream to make it more visually appealing.",

I doubled the corn muffin mix as reviewers had suggested which was perfect - one box would not have been enough to cover. I used 1/2 the water suggested in recipe which was perfect - the amount in recipe seemed like it would make it too watery. I used Mexicorn which was great in it; also put 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese ontop before the cornbread layer. So good!!!",

I also used salsa instead of diced tomatoes (as I didn't have diced tomatoes). I took others' suggestions of adding corn and cheese to the cornbread mixture. I used an 8X10 inch pan and had just barely enough cornbread mixture to cover the beef. It was good!",

First, use taco sauce or salsa instead of water, it just adds way more flavor. And second, add a layer of shredded pepper jack cheese over the corn before pouring on the cornbread batter. Also, use a smaller casserole dish than designated so that one package of corn muffin mix will be enough. If you go with the 9x13, you'll need 2 packages for sure. Hubby and I really enjoyed this and will definitely be making it again! Mucho gracias to MICHARD for posting this one!",
