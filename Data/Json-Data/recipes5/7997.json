But rest assured, this is at least twice as good as your average grilled chicken, North American or otherwise. Generous amounts of freshly ground pepper and chopped cilantro are the main players in the marinade, while a sweet, garlicky dipping sauce is the perfect accompaniment.",

If I were to make it again I would slice the thighs thinly to cook better using a frying pan or use chicken breasts instead and do the same. The thighs looked nice in the package but when I pulled them out I had a nasty job of trying to remove most of the fat which on a kilo of chicken weighed in at one gram. Chef John put the lid down on his BBQ and so finally I covered the pan because they were taking far too long to cook. I would use the full two tablespoons of pepper because I wimped out put only one and when they made their appearance I wished there were more. I'll try it again with said provisos. The dipping sauce was hein. Less vinegar more chili sauce and cayenne! I have yet to perfect it before serving to guests.",
