Besides the waffle cone pieces, you could try vanilla wafers or biscoff cookies (or even strawberries for a slightly healthier option.)",

In the real dessert, the filling always seemed creamier to me also. Are they using heavy cream, mascarpone, not sure. It was also missing a hint of fruit flavor maybe lemon or something that I have tasted in cannolis. I don't think it is this recipe as I have tried similar desserts and dips that play on the cannoli theme, just eliminating the shell, and felt the same way about the ricotta taste and texture. It does taste better after it is refriferated though.",

                "reviewBody": "Loved the taste of this, but like other reviews, it came out very soup like. I saw the reviews to strain the ricotta a little too late as I'd already made it. However, for those of you who also didn't strain the cheese and ended up with cannoli soup, you can fix this by taking three tablespoons of cornstarch and heating it in a saucepan with about 1/2 cup of milk (or heavy whipping cream) until it makes a thick smooth paste. Add this to your dip and mix it with an electric mixer until it's blended and smooth. Since I substituted 4oz of the cream cheese with a pint of heavy whipping cream (per another recommendation on here) I ended up with more filling than the original recipe and ended up using six tablespoons of cornstarch and about a cup of milk brought to boil (briefly) to bring the dip to the consistency of actual cannoli filling. It didn't affect the taste at all, but if it does for you, just add more sugar and perhaps more chocolate chips.",
