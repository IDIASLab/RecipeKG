I made this for a potluck at work with yukon gold potatoes specifically plus a couple of adjustments: a) Added greek yogurt after sauteeing and mashing (I always do this with mashed potatoes--great sour cream substitute) b) Added some shredded sharp white cheddar after sauteeing and mashing c) Only did half the leek called for but my leeks were pretty huge and I didn't want to overdo it. I work with a lot of foodies and I've already had two of them reach out to ask for my changes because they wanted to take them to a Thanksgiving or other holiday potluck. This recipe is a great base for mashed potatoes that you can easily customize with your preferences!",
