There is a textural difference between the two.  The black belugas have more a round shape than most other types and this seems to give it a pearl look and texture.  They do tend to hold their structure while they melt in your mouth.  Both were creamy and flavorful.  I made mine in a pressure cooker to save time.  The first time I augmented the broth to 6 cups just to make sure there was enough liquid and the end result was a bit more thin than in the picture but still creamy and delicious.  The second time I used 5 cups of broth, cooked 20 minutes in the pressure cooker and it was exactly as it should be:  a thick and creamy soup.  The cumin and spices are just perfect.  It freezes well too.  Thanks for the recipe.",

I did not precook the bacon or any other ingredients.  I omitted the vegetable oil and olive oil. After the soup was finished cooking, I discarded the bacon and bay leaf.  I added spinach to individual bowls just prior to serving. Will definitely make this recipe again!",

The heat level was a perfect spicy enough just to leave a bit of a tingle but nothing too overpowering. The bacon added a smokyness that kept having me going back for more.",

I was given two pounds of crappie filets so while looking through stew soup and chowder recipes I saw and watched his black lentil soup video. I wonder what Chef John would say about using this his lentil soup recipe as a base. Since he's not here to try my creation I (as always) am relying on the opinion of my family. I love my version and so do they. I had small whole green lentils and they stood up to simmering for 45 minutes. Also I did add half of a chopped jalape\u00f1o pepper and 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper to the onion carrot and celery. Another ingredient that appealed to me from a Bermuda fish chowder 3 tablespoons of tomato paste I stirred into the chicken broth. The small crappie filets (after sprinkling them with Old Bay seasoning) were added during the final 10 minutes of simmering. What do you think Chef?",
