This is embarrassing to admit but there was leftover sauce and I couldn't stop tasting it and ended up drinking what was left.  This is my favorite sauce but always avoided making it from scratch because it's very time consuming. But this is the answer to a delishious hollandaise,  it's quick and you won't be sorry about the taste. I made it for my daughter when she was home for Christmas and she copied the recipe and took it home with her.  I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  Diana~",
