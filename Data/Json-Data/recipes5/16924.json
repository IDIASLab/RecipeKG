I didn't have tomato juice on hand, so I used some spicy V8, thinned with a bit of water to cut the heat (so hopefully my daughter will eat it) and omitted the cayenne. Also used liquid smoke instead of browning sauce (not sure what the difference between these 2 is anyway) and cut the brown sugar down to 1 tsp instead of 2. I must say, if I already had the burger buns on hand, I might have one for lunch right now :-) Thanks for the recipe, I'm a huge Roseanne fan so I just had to try it out.",
