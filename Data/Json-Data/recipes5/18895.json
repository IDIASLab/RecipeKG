Just as I expected these had more of a pure pumpkin flavor not too sweet and not buried by frosting (which certainly has its own place too with pumpkin cake or cupcakes). I was tempted to skip the step of cooking the pumpkin with the spices but I'm glad I didn't because it's clear the process makes the flavor of the spices bloom. These are just the cutest rustic looking little bite-size muffins but in addition to 24 mini-muffins I got eight regular muffins as well (400 degrees 15 minutes). I wanted the glaze to be visible and not soak into the muffin so I just added enough orange juice to the powdered sugar to get it to an Elmer's glue-like consistency. This is just what I was after for Hubs to take to a morning meeting to offer with coffee -not too sweet tasty and no fork required!",

Initially cooking the canned pumpkin seemed strange but I think that cooking it with the spices must give the pumpkin a greater depth of flavor. However it did make the muffin batter seem rather thick but don't let this worry you! Despite the thick batter the muffins turn out very moist with a cake-like consistency--not super dense or dry at all. FYI I made a few minor alterations to the recipe: used 1 tsp of ginger instead of 1.5; used 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1; substituted light brown sugar for dark. I also made my own cinnamon glaze instead of the orange. (Hubby doesn't like orange though it sounded tasty to me!) But the basic muffin recipe itself is great! I've tried a few pumpkin muffin recipes on allrecipes.com and this one is my new favorite! Will definitely make again.",

Oh I cut the oil in half substituting plain yogurt upped the cinnamon a bit and added 1/4 ts of allspice and about 1/4c chopped pecans. Yummy!",

I have a convection oven so I had to bake them at 400 F. I made 2 different glazes: one with confectioners sugar and grand marnier and one with confectioners sugar and orange juice. I preferred the orange juice glaze- the one with grand marnier was a little too strong for the pumpkin flavor. Just a tip: Always sift the confectioners sugar before making a glaze- it will always come out smooth. But if there's lumps in the sifter afterwards don't force them to go through just throw them out. It can give you specks through out the glaze. I still feel like the batter could use a few more spices so next time I will add some pupkin pie spice to the mixture. I will definately be making these again!",

I followed the recipe almost to the 'T' including heating up the pumpkin which was a total waste of time and energy. The only change that I made was to add MORE ginger (about 1/2 a tsp) because I love ginger and these muffins were totally tasteless. Will not make again.",
