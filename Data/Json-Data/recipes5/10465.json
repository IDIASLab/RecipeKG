I didn't make the harissa sauce (though I think I will in the future) so I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used sriracha and some other spices as a substitute. Once I tasted the yogurt sauce I knew I couldn't just use it as a marinade and then just toss the rest of it--so instead of grilling I baked the chicken breasts in the marinade at 375 for about an hour. The chicken was so ridiculously moist and flavorful! And then I spooned some of the sauce (it makes a TON) over roasted veggies. I will DEFINITELY make this again.",
