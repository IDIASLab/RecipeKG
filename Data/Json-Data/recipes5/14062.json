I used a variety of peppers poblano jalapeno and yellow and orange bell peppers. I almost took a short cut and was just going to chop and saute them but I'm so glad I adhered to the recipe and roasted them first which didn't require much more effort. The skins slipped off easily and I think roasting the peppers contributed depth of flavor. I didn't bother with the green onion as I found the regular onion sufficient. Once I combined the sauteed chicken with the pepper mixture I found that simmering that mixture 10-15 minutes was enough to cook the chicken. I believe 25 minutes would have made it overcooked and quite probably dry and chewy. Half the amount of cilantro was perfect for hubs and me but that is a matter of personal taste buds. For added richness I swirled in a little butter at the end. I served this over white rice with a side of \"Black Beans with Bacon \" also from this site. I am really surprised that as I write this only 17 other people have reviewed it. I hope this review will encourage more cooks to give this recipe a try!",

I did add a serrano pepper as suggested, for extra kick.  It was tangy and flavorful, the flour coating helped the chicken to retain just a bit of crispness as well as giving the sauce body.  I served this with black beans and cornbread.  Yum!  A keeper.  \n\nFor the peppers: Put charred peppers into a Ziploc and close, allow to cool, and then peel off the skins.  This steams the peppers and allows the skins to come off more easily.  The oven roasting was great, though if you have a gas stove you can also char them directly on the burner.  The roasting adds nice depth to the dish.",

I do think it'd give this dish the \"fill\" it needs. I used two very large poblanos and added two serrano peppers. I also seasoned the flour with white pepper and jalapeno powder. I think I may add more broth next time and serve it over rice. As it stands there wouldn't have been enough juice to flavor up the rice. I roasted the peppers and heated the sauce the night before to allow the flavors to blend better. I was cooking stuff on the stovetop anyway so keeping an eye on the peppers was easy. I think 25 minutes is too long to roast them as they were quite cooked when done. Next time I'll use my own method of oiling them up and roasting them on the proprane grill. I also added a splash of fresh-squeezed lime juice before serving also. Very good - thank you!",
