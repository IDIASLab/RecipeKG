It's not a prime rib five star but for taste it's definately a fast five star meal. I did change the a few things.  I used kielbasa instead of hot dogs because my wife wont eat hot dogs but likes kielbasa.  I uses white beans instead of the honey beans and added a can of pinto beans, making it a four bean casserole, just to take up the extra room in a 9x13 casserole dish.  I also added a sprinke of garlic powder and pepper.  I couldn't get enough of this tasty treat! Thanks Joann for a great idea.",
