Props for being a healthy beautiful recipe you CAN make ahead. I made this salad twice. Once I made and ate at prep-time and once chopped and mixed all the vegetables except the lettuce the day before. I mixed the dressing and poured it over the veg and the acids even kept the avocado from changing much at all overnight! I poured veggies and dressing over lettuce that morning and kept meat beans and cheese mixed separately for warming. Added together at work the next day it was still delicious! The one downside is I went light on the dressing because I think it's a large amount of honey that isn't fully balanced. The tanginess is interesting and makes a traditional taco salad more exciting but there's something missing I can't quite pinpoint. Unlike most dressings this one contains no oil and I wonder if that base would mellow it out to what I expect.",

I would add jalape\u00f1o slices, instead.  But..........the dressing was outstanding.  I will be making it again for other salad uses.  I didn't have champagne vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and only about 1 1/2 TB of honey as I wanted the zing of the lime juice to shine.  I did opt to use the shredded cheese.  For the salad I would give a 4-star rating, but because we loved the dressing I'm giving the dish 5-stars.",
