I was generous with the carrot and celery (doubled the amt).  The final product was a bit thicker than I expected, but not TOO thick. Still, maybe another 8 oz of beef broth would have been just fine.  It was good for dinner, served with some corn muffins.  I'll certainly add this to my 'cook again' list.",
