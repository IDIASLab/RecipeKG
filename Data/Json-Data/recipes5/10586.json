I have since done a few things to add to the flavor and learn from my mistakes.  I do not have a Dutch oven but a large roasting pan with lid works fine.  The first time I made it I had 2 pork butts weighing in at 15 lbs total (cooks in twelve hours no matter what size butts you have).  Just remember that the more you make the more fat will leak to the bottom of your vessel.  I had so much fat that first time that it flooded the ramekins.  I now set the butt and ramekins on a mesh stand that sits perfectly inside my roaster \u2013 about an inch high (you can easily make one with heavy duty chicken wire).  I cut the top off of a small to medium sized onion and the tops off of a small bulb of garlic and sit them on the stand which permeates the meat and adds a nice pungency to the flavor and aroma.  Several people have told me that this is the best pulled pork they have ever had, without knowing that it had not been properly 'smoked'.  I chop it very rough and remove most of the fat so that the pork speaks for itself.  This pork is so juicy and tender it is surreal.",

I mean really!  It isn't about the rub or the sauce.  It is about how the meat comes out.  I didn't have a bbq dry rub so I used one I found on the Food Network...Bobbie Flay I think.  1 tablespoon each of cumin, paprika, granulated garlic, granulated onion, chili powder and brown sugar; 2 tablespoons kosher salt; and 1 teaspoon each of cayenne pepper, white pepper and black pepper.  I used about a 1/4 of the batch.   I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce.  I can't rave enough about how good this was.",

I decided to step it up a little & try this. Let it suffice to say the other is still in the crockpot in the fridge. I made it EXACTLY as outlined.  He was happy, and grateful that I tried this new and better incarnation.  I used a rub from Sandfly BBQ in Savannah and Johnny Harris BBQ sauce, on homemade bread.  Wonderful.",

I used the same ingredients for the rub and sauce that \"poshlynne\" listed in her review (review #4) - thank you poshlynne!!! I think Chef John's technique with the smoke flavor and poshlynne's spice rub were both key to the success of the recipe.  Try it! You'll LOVE it!",

There is nothing that resembles a smoked pulled pork. The BBQ sauce in my opinion is the only thing that takes this to something other than a roasted pork dish. I will stick to the smoker should I desire pulled pork. Basically same ingredients & same amount of time. End results are galaxies away.",
