I rinsed them both, then put the beets in the food processor. Next I sauteed the onion and garlic in a little olive oil until translucent. I went ahead and threw the chickpeas in with them, though this probably didn't make much of a difference. Then I poured the onion, chickpeas, and garlic into the food processor with the beets. I added the lemon juice and cumin and salt (I didn't add the tahini because i'm on a diet, but this would be the moment to add it), and then I blended them all together. I found this low-fat, 20-minute version of the recipe to be very tasty!",

If you have the time it is worth it but dont fool yourself it will take a good hour and a half at least. I didnt need any of the reserve liquid in-fact it was more moist than I am used to and I aded more tahini at the end. If you have a smaller sized food processor you might want to make it in batches or reduce the amount. We like our food spicy so I tripled the cumin and garlic. Overall this was a great recipe and I will make it again. A good recipe to make on a Sunday afternoon while I have other things to do around the house while the beets are boiling.",

The colour is amazing (it would look great side by side with guacamole or layered in a glass bowl with guacamole and regular hummus). With the garlic tahini lemon juice cumin and s&p I just added to taste as I blended (start with a little and go up from there) to get the flavour I like. I might cut back the amounts by half next time as this recipe makes A LOT if you're just making it for yourself! I wouldn't reccommend this to strict hummus traditionalists because of the sweetness and flavour difference the beets add but for people who like to mix it up a little - give it a try!",
