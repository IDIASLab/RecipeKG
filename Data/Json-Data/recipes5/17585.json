The idea of sprinkling actual ground coffee seemed strange but the taste is bewitching. Only problem is that the top is dusty and the walnuts don't stick even though I pressed them in. Maybe it would work better to pre-melt the chocolate and mix the coffee in with the melted chocolate then spread it over the cookie base and sprinkle on the walnuts.",
