The second time I made it I added 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder and an additional tablespoon of monk fruit. Really good and chocolatey. Some may prefer an additional tablespoon of monk fruit. The additional cocoa powder adds 3 more carbs or 1 carb per serving. It may even stretch the servings from 3 to 4. I'm not sure that it will freeze up with the addition of the cocoa powder It's been in the freezer for 3 hours and is still not freezing. It makes a great tasting mousse. Thanks for an easy and tasty treat. (It took awhile but it finally began to freeze so just leave it overnight for a frozen dessert.)",
