These are the things I did different: used red and yellow peppers, used thin sliced red onion instead of the green onion, added capers, and the dressing was olive oil, minced garlic, dijon mustard, champagne vinegar...salt/pepper. I also toasted the bread cubes in olive oil in a fying pan ontop of the stove. Wow...what a great tasting salad!! Used lots of chopped basil, too! Adds a ton of freshness. I made this with grilled Italian sausage and \"Zucchini Patties\" from this site. Definately a keeper!",
