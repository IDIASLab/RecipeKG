For me the sweetness just didn't go well with the spinach; it needed some saltiness such as soy sauce to balance it out. Plus cooking the spinach in sesame oil seems to be a waste because I couldn't taste it. I think it would work better to wilt the spinach in a dry skillet and add the sesame oil at the end for flavoring. Unfortunately even the ground sesame seeds didn't work well: They ended up getting soggy sitting on the sauteed spinach. My boyfriend who loves spinach didn't care for this either. I think this might be better with some modifications either baked or as a salad. Thanks anyway.",
