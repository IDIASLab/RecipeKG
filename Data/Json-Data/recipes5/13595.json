I'm not much of a cook, so I was pleased to have a meal that felt like I knew what I was doing.  The only problem I had was that the pepperoni just pulls the mozzarella straight out when you try to cut it with a fork.  The pepperoni got sort of lost in the flavors anyway (this dish is very pesto-forward), so the next time I left it out, and it was still great.  The last time, I swapped regular pepperoni for those thicker mini pepperonis, and just added a few to each loaf's center.  This was really good!  Easier to eat, and I could still taste the pepperoni.  This is now one of my standard recipes.",
