I doubled the recipe, and only used one red pepper (actually, it was an orange pepper), and replaced the other pepper with an onion, which I cooked with the garlic and hamburger.  Per other reviewers\u2019 suggestions, I used a generous amount of salt (thoroughly ground into the thoroughly-ground-up hamburger meat, of course).  My only beef (pun intended) with the recipe is that the purported total cooking and prep time is fifteen minutes (LOL)!!  It\u2019s more like an HOUR and fifteen minutes!!  This goes very well with this sesame green beans recipe (http://sidedish.allrecipes.com/az/SsmGrnBns.asp).",
