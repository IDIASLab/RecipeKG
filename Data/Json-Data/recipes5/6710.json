We like a little more kapow so I added jalapenos with a few seeds 1/8 tsp cayenne and some cumin. I used chopped garlic in a jar but fresh would be better. I tripled the cilantro and omitted spinach. I boiled the corn then threw it in a pan over high heat for about 7 minutes. Probably not as good as grilled but still yummy. Thanks for the recipe!",

This is by far one of the best salads I've made and would go with pretty much anything. I do recommend waiting to add the spinach until an hour before you plan on serving it so that it doesn't get too wilted. This is a great recipe and one that I will make often in the summer.

To save time I cut the corn off the cob while cold and put it on a flat grill pan with a little olive oil and placed it on a medium heat grill (without the boiling process) and the corn browned up nicely in the pan in about 12 minutes (season with salt). I cooled the corn and added the rest of fresh ingredients (minus spinach avocado & cheese) and dressing in bowl three hours before guest arrived. When guests came I put the charred corn and toppings on field greens and it didn't need any other dressing. (I didn't have a ripe avocado or Gorgonzola so these were left off) So delicious! I doubled the corn/vegetable/herb topping and used the second half as corn salsa with tortilla chips later in the night and it was a hit too!",

Slight modifications I made was to use the microwave to dehusk the corn so I skipped the boiling step as my method cooks the corn slightly prior to my roasting it. A lot of recipes that entail grilling assumes that you have a gas grill where the temperature can be controlled. I do not, I have a charcoal grill, so it took me a bit longer to prep the corn but it was good. I skipped the chives and used dried cilantro.  I got very healthy servings out of this recipe but it made more for me other than two servings the recipe states.",
