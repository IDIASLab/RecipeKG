This recipe is supposed to make one smallish pizza, and the batter is supposed to be thin, and the 3 cups of flour was not compatible with that.  I wound up adding more water to my batter, but it was still too thick, so when I piped it into the pan it didn't make a thin, crispy crust like it was supposed to.  I also made two more pizzas and still had some batter left over!  I did get better at making the pizzas as I was working on it, so I bet I'll be really good at it next time when I use the correct amount of flour.  Chef John, if you fix the recipe, I'll adjust my review to 5 stars.",

                "reviewBody": "I love this method of making thin crust pizza dough! It's amazingly easy! I recommend weighing the flour based on Chef John's notes to obtain the correct consistency. Should you choose not to weigh the flour start with 1 cup of flour add the honey olive oil salt yeast and water; mix and then gradually add the remaining flour in small increments (approximately 1/4 cup each addition) until the desired consistency is achieved. Ensure that each additional flour is completely incorporated before adding more. The dough should have the consistency of a runny batter (watch the video for guidance). I changed the recipe and method a bit solely out of necessity. I substituted instant yeast for the active dry yeast since I only have instant yeast at home. As a result of this change I was able to cut the rest time by about one hour. I have to admit to cutting corners at the end; instead of piping the dough onto the cast iron skillet I poured approximately 1 cup to 1 1/2 cups of dough into the center of the skillet and spread it around with a large offset spatula using the circumference of my skillet as a guide in making perfectly round pizzas. This method worked for me; however Chef John may not approve of it!;-) I was able to make three 12-inch pizzas with this recipe which my family absolutely loved! I will definitely make this again!",

When that put too much strain on the whisk I used a spatula and no matter how long I mixed it I never got it to liquify. Close but not like yours. It did rise (out of a large pyrex bowl) and that consistency was like yours but after stirring with a ladle again not as thin as your batter. I still made it but for some reason I had enough batter for 2 full size cast iron pan pizzas that were about 1/2\" thick. I gave you 5 stars because I see someone else tried it and had a 5 star experience and I'm sure it was. Also I really liked your presentation and witty comments. I'm still a big fan!",
