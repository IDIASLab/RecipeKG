I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the coconut, and it's a must to serve with a little vanilla ice cream.  It really smoothes out the flavor, just irresistable.  I uploaded a photo of mine.  It actually got cooked 1/2 hour or so longer before we got to dig in and was just fine, just remember to stir a little so that it doesn't get stuck on the edges or dried out.  Definitely a keeper!",
