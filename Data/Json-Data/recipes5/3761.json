Jean-Pierre, the owner, chef, and sole waiter, demonstrated the proper method of eating it. First, you spread mayo over the croutons, then top them with cheese, float them in the broth, spoon soup over them, and finally, scoop them up and eat them while they're still crunchy. To die for!",

We didn't have the cheese to go on top but the baguettes with the topping really were not lacking without it. We only used 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes which had a great kick. Any more would have been a mistake. Instead of half-of-half we mixed 1/4 cup cooking cream & 1/4 cup 1%milk. We didn't have cod so we used tilapia filets instead. Turned out great. For this amount of fluids we used 2 lbs. of tilapia. WARNING: When blending hot fluids don't seal the blender lid shut tight. I did this and it exploded all over the kitchen burning me in the process. I now know leave the lid cracked and cover with a towel. Thank for the amazing soup!!!",
