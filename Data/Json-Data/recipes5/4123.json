This recipe is fabulous and the closest match that I could find to the pub's chicken.The only issue that I had was that the cream sauce was a bit lemony and a little bitter from the wine. To balance that, all I did was add some garlic powder and a little salt to the lemon sauce and it turned out excellent!! It is now in my recipe box!",

Instead of baking the chicken in the oven I browned it in a skillet with olive oil for about 10 min to save time then I removed the chicken from the skillet and made the sauce. I made it as described but substituted olive oil for the butter since thats what I used in the skillet. I didn't think the milk was necessary as it already had heavy cream. Make sure not to let the sauce cook for long cause it will reduce quickly. I also added some capers to the sauce which gave it a gourmet look. My boyfriend raved. Thanks for sharing!",

I did not have lemon pepper for the chicken so I used poultry seasoning instead and cut the breast in chunks (and I let it marinade with the rest of the ingredients for less than an hour) and cooked the chicken in a non-stick pan on the stovetop. This adds color to the chicken!! Tossed the sauce in some cooked whole wheat spaghetti and tossed in some fresh steamed spinach and topped it with the chicken breast and sprinkle some fresh parm. cheese and parsley served with a garlic toast......better than if I had ordered it at a restaurant!!",
