I bake in 8\" square pan.  Bake for about 25 minutes or a bit longer if needed.  \n\nWhat I really appreciate is the low calorie count even with the pineapple addition.  I do think that this recipe should be reclassifiend under snacks!",

'Can't like the same things - ever!:D Update (Years later. That six year old is now fourteen!:O:D) I tried it again omitting the lemon juice adding half teaspoon vanilla extract & half teaspoon cinnamon. It was closer to two & a half cups shredded carrots too. I baked for about half an hour on three fifty greasing & flouring an eight by eight. I could taste that little bit of cinnamon which wasn't bad but I think I'd like a more subtle taste. No it didn't scream \"cinnamon \" but if you're thinking of adding I wouldn't add more than half teaspoon (especially considering the low sugar amount. 'Could easily become bitter.) Oh used smart balance olive oil/butter blend. No problem with dryness - either time. Fourteen year old still likes it but not that there are carrots in it.:) It is a vegetable ya know!:D Prep note: If your carrots aren't pretty peel 'em. Mine weren't & dark spots from the peel showed up the next day.",

It also used cake flour (1-1/2 cups) and included 1 tsp cinnamon and a half tsp nutmeg and no salt 1-1/2 cups carrot 2 Tb lemonjuice 1Tb lemon rind and same amnts eggs and baking powder and baking soda as this recipe.
