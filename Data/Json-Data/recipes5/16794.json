I must say that I did NOT experience any of the problems that some did. The dough was easy to work with and although the cookie itself is not cloyingly sweet, it does get the frosting which sweetens it up considerably. I'll just mention that I used 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c shortening as I was short on the butter. Also, as with any roll-out cookie I make. I chill for a minimum two hours then take the dough out and let it come to room temperature for a minimum of 1/2 hour before rolling. No pie-crust taste here. Just yummy cookies. Thanks for the recipe.",

We loved this cookie! It's so pumpkin-y/orange-y tasting...No pie crust, bland cookie here!  I also had no sticky problems.  It is a cut out cookie, so it does need to be chilled for a least a couple hours!  It rolled out beautifully.  I used Halloween cutters  (I frosted half of them for the kids) The flavours are more pronounced the next day.  A nice soft, flavorful cookie with a tinge of Autumn.  THX",
