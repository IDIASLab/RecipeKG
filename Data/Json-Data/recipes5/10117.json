The only thing I changed was the cooking method. I cooked the pine nuts in the oil on medium-high heat until they started to brown then turned the heat down to low and added the apples and garlic. This insured that the pine nuts were toasted (which is important to enjoy their flavor fully) and the garlic didn't get too brown (which can make it bitter).",
