I followed the recipe except for two things: I added 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little zing. I sliced the zucchini into 1/4-inch slices rather than 1/2-inch as the recipe said. We ate this over white Jasmine rice. Wow, so good! I will definitely make it again. Thank you for posting this recipe.",

I omitted the olives and substituted the cheddar cheese for grated Parmesan. But whatever kind of cheese you choose, I would only sprinkle it on when serving, and would not mix it into the skillet (especially if you plan on reheating any leftovers). Jumping back to the beginning: To reserve the flavor of the onion and garlic, I first brown the ground beef then drain it and set it aside, then in a little bit of oil I saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic in the skillet for a few minutes before mixing them all together. My hubby added red pepper flakes to spice up his own plate. I loved it too, and will definitely make this \u201cminimal-mess\u201d, versatile dish again.",
