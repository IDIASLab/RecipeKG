I used a pre-made thin crust (similar to Boboli)that came in a package of two and only needed half of the meat mixture to spread over the crust so I am ahead of the game when I want to make a second one. Using a pre-made crust I didn't need to mess with moving the pizza from low to higher rack. I just cooked it in the middle at 400F for about 10 minutes and it came out great. I adjusted the seasonings down (about 1/2 tsp. cumin and 3/4 tsp. chipotle pepper) to suit our tastes and it was hot enough for us with the 1 Tbsp chili powder. I used one poblano pepper and chopped it rather fine so there was no need to pick any of it out. This was a very simple and tasty recipe and satisfied our desire for Mexican food around Cinco de Mayo.",

Anyhow I mixed a little spaghetti sauce to the chipotle sauce since I had both opened in the fridge I smeared it around the crust after I flipped the dough over on the grill. I added the cooked crumbled Italian sausage & pepperoni. I spent the afternoon roasting Hatch chilies so I chopped up a couple and on they went too! Topped the whole thing with cheese let it melt. I served my hubby right on the cutting board! I thought it made a unique serving vessel. He went CRAZYYYYYY for this pizza!! Wish I could give this 10 's!!! THANK YOU Chef John. Keeper for sure:))",
