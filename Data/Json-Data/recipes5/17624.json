I had to cook off another 3-4 cups of sweet potato just to get it thick enough to form using leftover large orange Halloween marshmallows for the regular large ones in this recipe. Mine also didn't stay in the oven 10-12 minutes and they were exploding and almost flat before plating. Taste-wise they were okay. Would I attempt this recipe again. I'm sorry to say no.
