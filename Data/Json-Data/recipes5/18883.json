Didn't have pecans so I used almonds. To make it more like pumpkin pie I used pumpkin puree instead of apple sauce. Found I had to bake it longer than the recipe showed but it continued to dry after I removed it from the oven. It has excellent pumpkin flavour with the puree in there and the whole family loved it. Will definitely make this time and time again! Don't be afraid to play around with the recipe.",

One change I made was to substitute canned pumpkin (mixed with 2 tbs. of milk) for the applesauce. I was really looking forward to making this because it sounds like such a unique and delicious recipe. I was a little disappointed however that it really didn't taste a whole lot like pumpkin pie. That is why I am giving it four stars. It is a very easy healthy and tasty granola though. Do not hesitate to try this! Just don't expect it to taste a whole lot like pumpkin pie!",

This is the first time I've made granola so after browsing through all the other recipes I decided to try for this one since it didn't use oil. SO happy I did! I read the other reviews and decided to compromise with the oven at 275. It took a little longer to cook 1 hour 15 minutes but after letting it sit it became much more crunchy and I decided I may have overcooked it very slightly. I also used walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had on hand. Added a few dashes of cinnamon as well. Other than that stayed true to the recipe and so glad I did. While it didn't really taste much like pumpkin pie the flavors worked so well together it didn't seem to matter! No more expensive store bought granola for me!",

This was so simple to make and it turned out fantastic! All three of us (my two sons and myself) thought this was one of the best granolas we've ever had. I made this early this morning and let it cool and we had it for breakfast an hour later so it was nice and fresh and crunchy. I have about a cup leftover that I stuck in Tupperware I'll update my review if it turns out that it's less not as good the next day. I don't think of pumpkin pie when I eat it but it does make me think of fall/winter. I'll make this again--next time I'll try this with applesauce and my homemade apple pie spice.",
