And I only used 3 cups of tequila because that is all that I had.  That was plenty for the roast I had.  I agree that the rice was too much.  I made 2 cups instead of 3 and threw away  over half of it.  I think 1 cup of rice would probably be about right.  I put my enchiladas into a 9 x 13 pan and I could only fit 6 in the pan.  So I made a second pan and froze it.  My husband requested that there be more sauce, but otherwise everything tasted great.  I like the mix of spicy and mild sauce, it gave it a subtle  heat.",

All together, it is rather labor-intensive but definitely worth the work. With all the ingredients, it is certainly tasty -beans, meat, cheese, with just the right amount of kick- it is worth the time and effort it takes to get this together. I had a bunch of rice and beans left over, so I served them on the side. Thank you for the recipe.",
