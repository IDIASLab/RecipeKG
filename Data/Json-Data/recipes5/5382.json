These were quite good, however, very flavorful, and the three fish eaters in my family liked them (a couple kids won't eat any fish). I had two 14 oz cans and used them both. I added some liquid from the can. I added some chopped onion and garlic, and because I try to sneak in kale whenever I can, I added one big stalk of finely chopped kale. I didn't refrigerate them before cooking and they held together just fine. \n Besides that, I followed the recipe. It made a lot more than what we ate for one meal, but will make good leftovers.

That being said that was our 1st disappointment - that they didn't quite retain their shape. We also didn't like the taste of Worcestershire and lemon juice in them preferring some of the more \"basic\" salmon patty recipes that we've made on AR. Still a sprinkle of Texas Pete hot sauce and a side salad and we finished them all b/c I don't think the leftovers would've held together at all.",
