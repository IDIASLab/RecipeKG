My hubbie tasted it and looked at me and said \"On a scale on 1-5, babe this is a 10!\"  I have to admit I did alter the recipe... alot, but this was such a great base.  First off, I butterflied my meat for easier rolling and more tender meat.  Then I marinated my meat for 6 hours in \"Puerto Rican Garlic Marinade\" from this site.  Since it had the garlic in the marinade, I omitted it from the filling and fried the onions before adding them.  I used the whole package of spinach and it came out perfect!  We had my hubbie's best friend over for dinner and all you heard were \"Mmmm's\" and praises through dinner.  I served it with \"garlicky summer squash\" from this site, and I made a parsley-herb rice.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.",

I used 5-6 cloves of garlic that I had roasted in olive oil for the spread instead of raw garlic. A little more work but the smell of roasted garlic throughout the house is a wonderful hint of the dish to come. Then to cook I grilled it over high heat on all sides (maybe 10 minutes total) to sear. Then turned off one side of the gas burners moved the steak to the \"cool\" side of the grill and left the other side running fairly hot with the lid closed. Checked with instant read thermometer until temp hit 120-125 for medium rare. Let it rest 10 minutes. This served four of us three slices each with a few end pieces left...which didn't last! We all were sorry there wasn't any more. Easy easy dish to make and it looks nice!",
