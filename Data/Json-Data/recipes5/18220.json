I hated them but my practice batch disappeared quickly. I substituted the brown sugar for a less sugar brown sugar blend and doubled the spices on the second batch to make them a little more potent. So far everyone who has tried them has asked for the recipe. Thanks! (The molasses and rolling in powdered sugar are essential in this cookie.)",

I followed the directions carefully and exactly and came up with a dough that was much much too dry and wouldn't stick together enough to form balls. I should have given it up then but instead I looked online and other recipes said you may need to add some water to make them stick so I tried that. I think maybe I should have added a second egg instead but it doesn't really matter because after baking them for the full 12 minutes they were still uncooked on the inside (yes they were smaller than 1\" round) and the part that was cooked tasted terrible like just a paste made of molasses and flour. NOT a good pfeffernusse recipe!! Look elsewhere!",
