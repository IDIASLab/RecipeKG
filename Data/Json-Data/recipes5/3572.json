It doesn't crack and the result is quite a biscuity even textured pastry. Perhaps in the future I might try adding a little vanilla sugar or vanilla essence for an extra 'biscuity' taste. The actual filling has a really nice texture too and overall this is a yummy tart. When I make this next time I might use a little less lemon rind and juice because it was a little too lemony for me. But I guess that comes down to personal preference. This was a great recipe!",

I recommend going the extra mile to use fresh squeezed lemon juice as the flavor is somewhat dulled with bottled lemon juice. The crust is fantastic and it's a fabulously pretty presentation. One other note. The recipe says not to overmix the filling. If you do whip or whisk it too hard bubbles form and these often will remain during baking and detract from the prettiness of the final product.",

The thing I really loved about this recipe though was the tart crust. I hate traditional pie crust so I substitute this tart crust for pie crust in nearly all my recipes now. I also add a bit of vanilla to the tart dough. It's great with apples for an apple pie. One recipe of the tart crust easily does a single-crust pie and could probably be stretched to work in a double crust pie.",
