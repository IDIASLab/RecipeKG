I used less black pepper in the sauce and had to omit the poppy seeds as I didn't have any but I added some chopped pecans I like nuts in stir fry. I thought it could have used more sauce but I did use more chicken than stated; still I think making 1.5 times the sauce would be good. Instead of a bag of veggies I used broccoli florets snow peas and red bell pepper strips.",
