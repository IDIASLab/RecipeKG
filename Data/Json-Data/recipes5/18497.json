As others mentioned a thin sauce I dredged the chicken in flour before adding to the slow-cooker and then topped with the sauce ingredients. When the sauce is cooking it smelled kind of weird but when I served it over white rice it tasted terrific! The sauce was just slightly thickened (in a good way). Note for next time -- no need to double the sauce single batch makes plenty!",

On Sunday afternoon I wanted to cook something in my crockpot for the week ahead by the time I decided to try this chicken recipe it was 3:30 so I thought I'll cook it and at least it will be ready by around 8:00 pm then I'll have something ready for tomorrow. well I skinned the chicken thighs and put them in the crockput then put a can of tomatoe soup in a bowl and mixed in the soya sauce less then 1/4 cup and used 1/4 cup of brown sugar chopped up two cloves and maybe about 3 tbsp of minced onion and sliced thin about 4 small carrots stirred it all together poured it over the chicken gave that a stir. and had the pot on high....checked it at 7:30 and the meat looked purfect!! cooked some rice and wow! within 31/2 hours we were eating a wonderful tasty dinner my sons loved it! I have a rather finicky 3 year old and he loved this dinner! My 7 year old asked for 2nds!! I have a few pieces and lots of gravy left over for tomorrows meal Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and for all the little additional ideas....",

Added a can of tomato soup (didn't have another can of tomato sauce) about 1 Tbsp of ground ginger and 1 Tbsp dried minced garlic (out of fresh). Followed recipe on amount of soy sauce and brown sugar. Once the chicken was falling off the bone which only took about 6 hours on low in my slow cooker I removed the bones and used tongs to sort of shred the chicken. If trying to remove the chicken from the slow cooker to serve along side of rice and sauce I suggest using a large slotted spoon. The chicken is so tender that it will fall apart via any other method. I served the chicken and sauce over white rice and sprinkled slivered almonds on top. My husband and 6-year-old LOVED it. Will definately make again!!",

I used 3 frozen whole medium-sized boneless skinless chicken breasts (1 lbs total) 3/8 cup soy sauce 2 TBS veg broth 1/4 cup plus 2 TBS brown sugar 2 cloves of garlic 1 can of sliced mushrooms 1/4 of a largish onion (sliced) and the 8 ounces of tomato sauce. 8 hours on low later it was dinner time. I shredded the chicken a bit in the slow cooker and served it with white rice and steamed carrots and broccoli. It was sweet enough that our four-year-old enjoyed it and my husband inhaled the stuff!

The teriyaki-type sauce (a mixture of flavours that we didn't find strange at all) was a huge hit with the family and the meat was so moist it was falling off the bones.  Delicious and simple!  What more could a busy mom ask for.....  I did brown my chicken first, don't know if that was necessary or not.",

Cut the chicken in half from the suggested amount (little over a 1 3/4 pounds or 6 good-size legs) but made the full amount of sauce so we'd have plenty to go over our rice. Went with the low sodium soy doubled up on the brown sugar (1/2 cup) added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger some minced green onion and 2 teaspoons of corn starch. Perfection! Thanks for the recipe. Oh I noticed a previous review of this recipe where the author found it very time consuming skinning the chicken. A little tip is to take a folded paper towel and grip the chicken skin with the towel as you are pulling it off. The towel helps you keep a firm grip on the skin especially if your chicken is wet.",
