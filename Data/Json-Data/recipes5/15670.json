Brush both sides of tortillas with evo or in my case I used bacon fat (yes, not low cal), but great flavor.  Bake crust for 5-6 min.  In medium mixing bowl briefly whip eggs & milk(I used 4 eggs and 1/4 c. milk). Into beaten egg mixture, I added the prepared taco meat,  5 oz's. bottled salsa with queso(heated slightly so it could be stirred into the mixture), we like things hot--so I added 2 T. fire-roasted tomatoes. Pour this into crust and top with 1/4 c. shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese and place a sliver of jalapeno pepper above where each serving will be.  Out of the oven offer chilled toppings of diced tomato, shreds of lettuce & sour cream if desired...Yum!  I only baked it 14 min at 400.",

I used 3 eggs 1 cup milk kept the green pepper the same at 1/2 c. used 1/4 large onion about 1.5 c. cooked taco meat 2 handfuls shredded cheddar (didn't have mex cheese blend on hand) and 1/2 tomato chopped (instead of salsa which I also did not have). I baked it in a deep 9\" pie plate in my gas oven for 50 minutes. It sure looked pretty and smelled great coming out of the oven.
