I already had homemade ham bone stock on hand in my freezer to use up. I didn\u2019t have dried beans and used 3 cans of Great Northern Beans, drained and rinsed (probably could have tossed in an extra can). Since I was using canned beans and wouldn\u2019t need to simmer the soup for 2 hours, I saut\u00e9ed the carrots, onion, and celery until tender and then added the ham, beans, stock, etc. Those aren\u2019t major changes though and I otherwise followed the recipe/ingredient amounts to a T. My husband prefers his soups thicker and put some of the soup in a different saucepan and smashed some of the beans, letting it simmer a little longer. This worked out since I like more liquid in my soups. Thank you for the recipe, Bibi!",
