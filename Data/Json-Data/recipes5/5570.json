I used Penne corn pasta from Trader Joes (great pasta even if you love gluten) served the feta on the side and roasted the garlic. Great combination of flavors! Very refreshing and flavorful. I made this the night before serving and it was better the second day when the flavors had melded. It was a big hit. Even my dad who thinks everything should be made with mayonnaise loved it. Thanks Sandy! I will review again when I make it as written.",
