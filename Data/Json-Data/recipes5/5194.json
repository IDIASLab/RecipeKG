I usually cook Salmon on our fish nights just because of the benefits from all The Omega acids... However, after trying to branch out for some other fish , I bought Tilapia filets and have tried around 4-5 different recipes. This one by far is the best and easy too. The only thing I did before the initial broiling step was I did squeeze fresh lemon juice over the filets after a little salt and pepper. i kept the topping ingredients the same including fresh lemon juice. I don't know if it is just the right amount of ingredients blended together or what. To be honest, I didn't even measure the topping ingredients. I just estimated cause I'm old and have cooked since I was twelve.",
