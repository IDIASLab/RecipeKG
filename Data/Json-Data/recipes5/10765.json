The only thing I changed is I cooked the stew (prior to adding the barley) for probably around 4 hours or so in a heavy cast iron dutch oven.  This was, without a doubt, the greatest beef stew- although it isn't what you would traditionally think of beef stew.  It became this profoundly rich and beefy substance with such an exquisite gelatinous mouth-feel it was simply heavenly.  If I'm sick this is going to be my new chicken noodle soup.  I will make this again, within the week.",
