I made the pear sauce (1/2 TBS of cinnamon and apple cider vinegar instead of pear juice) and just cooked it down and smashed the pears (didn't use the blender) so it was slightly chunky- and delicious. I used one thick cut boneless pork chop and divided it between two people, added sauce when serving (with brown rice). It was declared 'restaurant worthy' (highest honor for an experimental recipe (!). Pork was not dry, sauce added to it tremendously.",

This was one-dimentional overly sweet had no acidity for balance (the lemon juice was non-existant) and even after cutting the cinnamon in 1/2 the only thing I could taste was pear & cinnamon not even the pork chop. The sauce was so thick & sweet I'll be using it as pear butter on toast for the next few mornings so it won't go to waste. My remaining pork chops will be put to better use in any dish but this. IF I were to attempt this again I'd cut the brown sugar to 1tbsp omit the pear juice & use water or white wine instead cut the cinnamon to 1tsp and use a thicker pork chop. But really I don't think it's worth all the effort; this one is not for me.",

First of all I used 2 little Delmonte pear cups and the juice from them instead of using fresh pears and buying pear juice. Second I did not puree the pear mixture as I like the texture of the whole little pears instead. I put 1 tablespoon of cinnamon in it and it was way too overpowering and gave it a gritty taste. Next time I will definitely add the cinnamon by \"to taste\" not buy these measurements. Also my mixture was thickened in 20 minutes; it didn't take 30 minutes like the recipe said. Overall it had a good flavor. This can also be done with apples if you do not like pears.",
