I have had the traditional recipe many many times and miss it greatly. This recipe was a nice uncomplicated option and still has a nice umami to it even if it isn't traditional.\n\nSo it is day 3 of a 14 day Covid 19 quarantine for our house. Thankfully it's a precaution and no one is ill yet. Coming up with recipes that don't require going out for something can be a challenge. I had all the things including 2 American eggplants that needed to be used. I taste the eggplant to check for bitterness. American eggplants get bitter as they get older. I don't bother with salting. I remove the skin if its bitter. I prefer anything but American eggplants but when living in the rural south you get what you get.\n\n I made the recipe exactly as written served over rice. Although I avoid frying eggplant. It is an oil sponge. I recommend baking it after dredging in oil 400* 15-20 min until its tender. I cubed mine for this recipe. I did add 2 tbs butter when the eggplant was added at the end. I would have served it with fresh lime slices or even bottled lime juice if I had some. I don't even have turmeric. lol",
