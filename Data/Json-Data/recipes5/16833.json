One hint- you dont need to whip the egg whites and it turns out the same, very fluffy and raised. I have always used deep dish pie crusts, makes one very full and nice, I dont use any nuts in the crumb topping.. make sure your butter is very chilled before you start using it, also, add 2 tablespoons more flour, seems to absorb and set better. Lastly, I cover the outside of the crust with foil, it bakes so fast with this recipe, can take it off 10 minutes before its done, but I use frozen crusts, so easier and just as good to me. You really cant mess this pie up, my husband even helps make it, its so easy. ****",
