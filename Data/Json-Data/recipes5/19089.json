I don't really care for fish much, but I've decided to eat it for my health.  Looking for a recipe with ingredients I had on hand, I found this one.  I can't get over how good it was. I absolutely loved it!  To save money, I only used half of the macadamia nut mixture, but it would have been wonderful with the whole amount.  I covered the fish with tin foil and put the fish in a 400 degree oven for 7 minutes.  Then I put the paste on the fish and returned it to the oven (w/o the foil) for another 7 minutes.  Don't overcook!  Trust me, you will love this recipe.  I can't wait to make it for my friends!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!\n\n",

Like others suggested I baked the fish at 400 for about 10 mins and then broiled the fish for about 3 mins to make the topping nice and crispy. Delicious!",
