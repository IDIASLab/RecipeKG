I doubled the recipe and it was enough marinade and brushing sauce for 4 medium sized chicken breasts.  I stuck to the recipe as written except for one extra ingredient.  I mixed in a Tablespoon of Louisiana hot sauce to give it a little kick.  It actually didn\u2019t taste all that hot to me, even after adding the hot sauce, but it added just enough heat to offset the sweetness of the sauce.  I used a red onion which gave the sauce a bolder flavor.  Next time I\u2019ll add a little cayenne pepper because I like spiciness, but the recipe is fine the way it is.  After the sauce cooled I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours, then put the chicken breasts on a hot lightly oiled grill, and brushed the rest of the sauce on them as they cooked.  Delicious.",
