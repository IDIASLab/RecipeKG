This was simple to make, and I followed the recipe exactly. That said, we found it to be quite bland, and the texture to be a little dry. Personally, I like my hummus to have a creamier texture. After tasting and rating it, I did add 1/8 tsp chili powder and a roasted red pepper which we really liked. I would say this is a good base for making hummus but needs additions to make it flavourful.",
