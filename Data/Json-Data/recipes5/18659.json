Next time I will modify the sauce ingredients to match a sauce for oven-barbecued beef that I've always liked from one of my old Betty Crocker cookbooks: 1/2 cup chopped onions 3/4 cup ketchup 1/2 cup vinegar (can use apple cider vinegar) 1 Tbsp. brown sugar 3/4 cup water 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce 1 Tbsp. prepared mustard 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper. B.C. says to simmer it for 5 minutes but I don't think it would hurt to simmer it for up to 15 minutes to meld the flavors. If anybody out there tries this let me know how it turns out. Also I baked the chicken for 25 minutes turned it basted it with the sauce and baked it for an additional 20 minutes. It came out fork tender. I'm from the old school of cooking and still believe in cooking chicken parts and porks chops for at least 45 minutes total. They've always turned out great!",
