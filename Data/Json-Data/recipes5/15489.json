That way you can keep it for leftovers.  Also, mix the dressing  with the meat, beans, tomatoes and cheese first, then add the chips on top and lettuce on bottom.  You can do without one of the onions, and one of the beans, kidney beans work best. A great dip for chips as a snack/appetizer, too!",

The Kraft \"Light Done Right\" Catalina dressing is great and has less fat/calories.  The leanest ground beef and using romaine/iceberg mix helps too! I also substitute Baked Doritos for the corn chips.  Very hearty & satisfying salad...Yummy!!",

I used the chips as a bedding on the bottom of a large bowl and put a few chips on top for garnishing. I will use this recipe again.",

Sometimes I add 2 pkgs of taco seasoning to the meat, unless of course, you are watching salt intake.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe Melanie.",
