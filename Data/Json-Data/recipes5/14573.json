I halved it;  the small cans of tomato sauce are 8 oz, so I also went down a bit on the other ingredients (since the scale down feature hasn't worked for a while on many recipes). I did find the smoky flavor slightly prominent, so I'd cut down a bit on the paprika. Also had to add a tsp of sugar for my tastes. I used this entire amount on three large refried bean and cheese enchiladas, brushing both sides with it, a little on the bottom of pan and reserving some for the top.",
