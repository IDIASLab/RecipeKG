This was definitely it! I made exactly as directed but instead of making a sandwich, I diced up half the breasts and topped the salad. The next day for lunch, I sliced up the leftover cold chicken and made a wrap, adding slices of dill pickle, a little mayo, and some lettuce. It was delicious! Once I get some brioche buns, I will make again as intended. It\u2019s a keeper.",
