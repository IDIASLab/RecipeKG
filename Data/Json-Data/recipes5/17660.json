I made the mistake of walking away from the stove while it was cooking though.  DO NOT do this.  The whiskey makes it boil very quickly, I am still three days later trying to get the caramelized mess up.  The sauce didn't get as thick as I would have liked though.  It was a little watery and all of my sugar did not disolve.  I will cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup if I make this again.",
