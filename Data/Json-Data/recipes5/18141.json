I used 1 tbsp. veg. oil (didn't have any olive) and 1 tbsp. sesame oil since since the rest of the reciple had an Asian theme to it.  I also added about 1/2 to 1 tbsp. hot red pepper flakes.  It certainly didn't add any spice but it may have added to the flavor so I'll do that again next time.  I marinated it for two days, grilled it med. to med.-rare and sliced it real thin against the grain.  Superb!  IMPORTANT:  You must slice this cut of meat thin and against the grain otherwise it won't be tender.",
