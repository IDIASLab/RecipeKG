This is a flexible recipe in which you can easily play around with the amounts of ingredients. I grill about a pound of thin asparagus spears then chop them and throw them on some spinach or a lettuce & spinach mix to make two main-course salads. I find that it's easier to coat the asparagus with the oil & lemon juice if I put roll it around in a rectangular cake pan. I also tried adding some powdered garlic the second time and enjoyed the taste. Thanks for sharing Heather!",
