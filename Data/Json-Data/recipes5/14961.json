(She didn't make her mashed potatoes this way until I got married and moved out)!  I've noticed some are leaving out the egg.  The egg will make your potatoes even fluffier, and rise higher.  Leave in the egg, you'll see!  Enjoy! Please note***The recipe I submitted was to use 1 tablespoon grated onion not 1 whole grated onion!  That may be why the onion taste is overpowering to some.",

When I put them in the baking dish, I was doubtful.  The next day, I stirred them up and made peaks with a fork.  An hour later, they were fluffy, and the tips were golden.  Rave reviews.  A definite keeper for any season or occasion.  Update: 11/04, I continue to use this recipe as the best I've ever found in do-ahead mashed potatoes, and the concensus is they're even better.  The recipe as written, including using Yukon Gold (as opposed to other varieties) is what makes it wonderful.   It's a no-fail for me.  Thanks again!",
