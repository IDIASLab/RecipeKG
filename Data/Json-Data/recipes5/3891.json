No mayo- no worries.\n\nI stuck with the base recipe but would suggest 2 things:\n1.  Plunge the green beans into ice water after you steam them so they retain their beautiful color.\n2.  I added chopped, wonderfully ripe, tomatoes, and black olives.  Really added great color and flavor!\n\nThe dressing recipe has a terrfic flavor to it----best served after several hours of marinating or even overnight!",

The trick is to use the same dressing amounts (although I did increase the garlic by 2 cloves) but to double the potatoes and basil. I only increased the green beans up to 1 lb, but I also added 1 lb. halved cherry tomatoes. I used a medium red onion instead of small. It turned out wonderful and I received many compliments. It is better after sitting a long time. I hope this helps!",

I used more of the beans from my garden, along with three red potatoes, green onions (because I didn't have a red one), and rather than all basil, I used an even mix of fresh basil and dill.  I also added about 1/2 C chopped red pepper for color and more sweetness.  The flavors combined with the dressing were wonderful.  I took the advice of one reviewer and I made this about an hour before dinner, and then after mixing everything, I let it sit at room temp. for that hour.  The flavors melded perfectly.  SO GOOD- I will be making this again soon!",

I boiled the potatoes for 10 minutes added the beans then let it boil another 5 minutes - both the potatoes and the beans were perfectly cooked and retained their vibrant colors. I don't much care for balsamic vinegar so I used white wine vinegar in its place. I also used green onion rather than red as I like its mild fresh flavor. I added the dressing while the potatoes were still warm and they just soaked it right up. And reminiscent of a dish I enjoy in Rome I added sauteed shrimp (there they also add calamari and tomatoes). I served this at room temperature along with \"Stuffed Mushrooms with Spinach \" also from this site to accompany our Stone Crab Claws feast.",

A few changes that I don't think really made a difference on my rating: served cold rather than warm/hot (\"potato salad\" should be cold!); used raw beans instead of steamed (for no reason other than it seemed like it would work just as well). The main change: I ran out of balsamic and substituted red wine vinegar. It was great this way - I'm convinced it will be even better with balsamic. Definitely will make again and again. Served with \"Crispy Fried Fish\" and \"Wisconsin Native's Beer Cheese Soup\" - both from this site. (Although I give the soup a lower rating.)",
