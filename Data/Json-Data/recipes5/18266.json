I added only one egg since I only used one pound of turkey I did use the whole package of tofu since others had said that it was too salty I cut down on the onion soup mix(1/2pkg) and soy sauce(1/8cup). I added about 1tsp of Emeril's Asian spice mix and that gave it a real nice kick. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe",

I also agree that the sauce makes it it...I think it's worth doubling or even tripling. I didn't think the sauce was too salty...keep it as is. However due to the other reviews abou the onion soup mix being too salty (and also the fact that I didn't have any on-hand) here's what I mixed the meatloaf with and it turned out perfectly seasonsed: 1/2 panko crumbs 2 TB's teriyaki sauce 1 small chopped onion 1/4 tsp black pepper 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper 1/8 tsp garlic salt 1/4 tsp Spike gourmet seasoning (or something similar). I followed the recipe with the same amount of eggs and I did add the green pepper but I used more tofu (19 oz. instead of 14 oz.) and used only 1 lb. of ground turkey. Delish! Will definitely make again!",
