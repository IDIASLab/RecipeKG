I had to omit the cauliflower, leeks, and mushrooms and bump up the broccoli alittle to compensate in order to get my husband to eat it, but it was still excellent!  I'm sure I would have personally enjoyed the extras, but I have a very picky eater! (It's taken me ten years to get him to tolerate broccoli!) I did add a an extra oz of cream cheese to thicken sauce just a little as she suggested and it turned out very well.  This sauce is basically a home-made alfredo.  I was hungry for a good pasta casserole but we are doing keto...so this was perfect!  The sauce was so tasty!",
