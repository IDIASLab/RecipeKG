Here are my changes:  I used 1/2 cup each of brown sugar, soy sauce, and ketchup, 2 cloves garlic, minced, and pepper.  Left out the ginger and salt (soy sauce is salty enough).  Cooked in crock pot on high for about 2 hours, then on low for another 2-3 hours.  The sauce was so good over white rice.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!",

I seasoned the chops with seasoning salt but did not add additional salt or pepper to the sauce. I doubled the sauce recipe and cooked 8 bone in chops.  I sliced up two green peppers and added them to the pot about an hour before it was finished.  I did thicken the sauce with cornstarch. The meat was falling off the bone in about 4 1/2 hours.  It was very tender and moist, the sauce was terrific over white rice.  Definitely a keeper!  I will try this recipe with beef and chicken also.",

I used 1/3 c soy sauce and a generous squirt of honey, based on others' comments.  They looked done after 4 hours on low, and I ate one after coming home from work.  The chops were dry, the sauce was thin, but the chops were good with the sauce on them. For my husband, who would be home 1-3 hours later, I added corn starch as others suggested and turned the crock pot to warm. Two hours later, I turned the crock pot off.  When my husband came home, soon after I turned the crock pot off, the pork chops were tender and not dry, the sauce was thickened and he raved about them.  Add enough corn starch and it's almost a barbeque type sauce or like the thick sauce Chinese restaurants sometimes serve.",

My family and I love fried pork chops but they are not all that healthy for you so I chose to fix them a different way and found this recipe. I used pork with the bone and cut the bone out. I then put monteral steak seasoning on them and browned them to keep them from drying out. I then followed the recipe with adding garlic and honey. We had it over rice. The sauce was so good that next time I am going to double the sauce ingredients so there is plenty to go around. The meat was falling apart and smelled so good. Thank you for sharing the recipe and thank you cooks for the ideas.",
