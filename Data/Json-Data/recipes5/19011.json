I thought the amount of celery would taste/look weird but it didn't. It was a great addition,the celery retains a crunch but was there mostly as texture as the flavor is either masked with the spice mix or gone because of cooking time.  I made the celery into dice so that it would resemble the same chop of the onion, figuring that is better looking than half moons. I also sauteed, onion and celery and garlic first in a little olive oil (I like my onion wilted) and browned inexpensive frozen ground turley (comes in a frozen roll)on top of that.  I did not drain since it was turkey and just omitted the water.  YUM! and thank you!",
