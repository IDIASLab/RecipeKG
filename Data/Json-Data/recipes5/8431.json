It was quite a hit with my boyfriend. I have also used strawberry preserves as well.",

Be sure to make it ahead and chill; it gets better the longer it sits in the fridge and the cookies soak up the cream. If you make the log shape it helps to cut on a sharp angle the slices look much better. Just before serving I added sliced strawberries and chocolate shavings. A dusting of cocoa powder would be pretty too!",

You need Nabisco's Famous Chocolate Wafers for the cookie.r They're sometimes hard to find but I find that usually at least one of the food stores around me will stock this. If desperate you can order a box of 6 packages through Amazon.com. Always make your own whipped cream (so easy to make). We sometimes use food coloring for various holidays (ie. half red/half green stripes for xmas pink for valentines day with sprinkles etc.) Leftovers are not as good the next day which is due to the whipped cream. I've always referred to this as \"Icebox Cake\".",

The closest thing I could find to chocolate wafers in my area was the Oreo 100 calorie chocolate wafer thins and they worked very well. I didn't even thaw it out bf I served it. I just sliced it right out of the freezer and put the slices on a plate w fresh strawberries. I also drizzled some of that majic shell chocolate all over the cake bf i put it in the freezer. Yum yum so delicious! It tastes like cookies and cream cake. Will def make again and again!",
