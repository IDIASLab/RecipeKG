I deglazed the pan which got the sauce ingredients warm to go into the slow cooker and preserved all the wonderful caramelized beef flavor. Cooked it on low for six hours and served with mashed potatoes and cooked carrots. I didn't thicken the broth but you could if you wanted to. It was a really good dinner and I am looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow! Thanks for a great recipe!",
