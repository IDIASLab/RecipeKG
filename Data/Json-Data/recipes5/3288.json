However the vodka doesn't add much. Vodka if you use a decent one doesn't have any flavor. Since the alcohol is cooked out it is just a filler. Instead try using whiskey. It provides a rich hearty flavor that I'm sure campers and grillers alike can enjoy. Otherwise a very tasty recipe.",

I used the marinade on some flank steak and let it sit for a couple of hours in the fridge. It turned out great. The tequila gave it a nice earthy flavor intensifying the steak's meatiness. The other ingredients seemed like a strange mix but the result was complex and slightly exotic without straying to weirdness. Definitely repeat-worthy!",

My only hesitation was whether or not I needed a filler in it's place but I chose not to. I stuck by the recipe exactly except for the vodka. The teriyaki/steak sauce/lemon juice mixture was quite good but I was surprisingly not a big fan of the tequila. The only thing it did to the marinade was give it a very bitter aftertaste. It wasn't horrible but I ended up dipping the rest of my meat in additional steak sauce just t eliminate the bitterness. If I made this again I would definitely leave out the tequila.",

Don't let this sit for too long as I did or you will get a buzz just grilling it. Oh and it needs salt. Just a little but it needs salt.
