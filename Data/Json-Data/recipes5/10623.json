I swear by your recipes and advice, but your application of Kosher salt as recommended on your video is completely over the top and totally ruined the dish, killing the flavor of the duck and the sauce. After the 15 minutes of dry brining, I recommend wiping the salt off altogether and refraining from salting again before cooking. That\u2019s the proper method for dry brining. I should have known better from past experience grilling, but I trusted your instructions, lowering my rating from five stars to two. Otherwise, the dish would have been great, and we wouldn\u2019t have wasted $40 on ruined duck breasts. Make this adjustment as to salt, and you\u2019ll be pleased with the results.",

The sauce was light and not too sweet. Roasted some winter squash and purple potatoes and a steamed half an artichoke on the side for a special dinner.  Even though I was worried about the cook times being under done, I let them rest in a warm oven while I made the sauce and it was perfect. Only wish I had taken a picture!",

As you can tell from the rating, we were incredibally satisfied. Followed the directions exactly, and confess that I probably should have cooked the duck a minute longer. The sauce was to die for. Absolutely loved the orange flavor and admit to basically drowning the duck in the sauce as I loved it so much. The meat was moist and tender despite being previously frozen. Will make again.",
