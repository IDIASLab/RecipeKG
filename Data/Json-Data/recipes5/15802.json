I sprayed my peppers with cooking spray, added salt and pepper, and stuck them in the oven while I did the rest of my prep so they would be soft.  I cooked the rice in a rice cooker and browned the ground beef and onions with lots of seasoning.  Mixed it all together, stuffed the peppers and topped with pepper jack.  Served with sour cream, and this was a winner!  Thanks for the great recipe.",

They don't like anything that's not processed and/or unhealthy. They did eat all the good stuff INSIDE the pepper though so that's a WIN! That said hubby and I thought they were terrific! I've made Mexican stuffed peppers before but these were much better. I think the difference was the salsa as opposed to tomato sauce. My husband bought the pre-shredded Mexican cheese but I think next time I'd like to try a Monterey Jack - something that might melt a little better and add a little more kick. Very good though - thanks for sharing! Oh and we topped ours with a little sour cream - YUM!",

I found that a lot of people who don't like green can enjoy the sweetness of a red. Also my cooking time was much longer. I baked the peppers for at least 45 minutes and they were still a little too crunchy. So if you like your peppers on the softer side I would blanch them first.

Since I used hot Pace Picante chunky salsa I only needed 1 cup. I was able to cook and mixed everything in one pan which made clean up a snap. I also added a can of corn then baked them at 375 degrees for 45 minutes so that the peppers would be soft. Absolutely delicious.",
