I didn't have a shallot on hand so I minced two garlic cloves instead.  I only used 2 tablespoons of butter in total rather than the 10 tablespoons called for.  After sauting the garlic I did not add any more butter.  I did not use cream.  Instead I used 1 cup of 1% milk.  I thickened the sauce with 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon of milk.  I also baked the salmon in the oven rather than in a skillet.  I lined a baking pan with aluminum foil, placed the salmon in the pan and poured the sauce overtop.  I then baked the salmon for 15 minutes at 400F.  (A good rule of thumb for baking fish fillets is 10 minutes per inch of thickness at 400F).  This was excellent and I would definitely make this again.",

I think I only used about 4 tbsp of butter.  I don't think I added more butter to the sauce once it was thick (if I did, it wasn't 1/4 cup) and used about 1/8 tbsp when cooking the salmon first.\r\nOnce the salmon was finished cooking in the sauce, I decided to thin the sauce a bit with more milk, lemon juice, and wine so that I could pour the sauce over some wheat pasta.

I did use the cream and used 1% milk. I used chicken broth in place of the wine and didn't add any extra salt. This was pretty easy to put together and the sauce went well with steamed broccoli and new potatoes. I really really liked the sauce and salmon is always yummy!",

I started with one small onion and one clove of garlic then proceeded with the sauce as suggested. It was terrific after the milk/cream has thickened I loved the wine and the vinegar in there for depth of taste and the herbs were lovely. (I doubled the dill and halved the thyme to make it a DILL sauce.) Then there was the 1/4 cup of butter to be added. I was suspicious of it but wanted to make the recipe as written first so I went along with it. At this stage it was still ok. But another 1/4 cup of butter for frying the fish? Then that to be mixed with the rest of the sauce? Very odd. I did end up taking at least half of that butter off the fish before mixing because it just looked wrong and yet it came out way to fatty. So sad as what I could taste of the sauce was great. I am a great fan of making rich food but with this I have to wonder if there was a type-o in the recipe. But I have certainly learnt from this. I plan to make this sauce for fish again and again and again - minus all the butter. Thanks for the recipe I'm sure it will be a fabulous 5 star one next time!",
