I made the sauce one evening and then refrigerated it.  The next evening, I assembled the lasagna and refrigerated that.  The third day I finally baked the lasagna.  I simply didn't have all of that time in one block to do the whole thing.  The homemade sauce was great and fully worth that amount of chopping and cooking time.  I made these changes: 1) just spray a little olive oil on the pan instead of using a whole 2 Tbsp. 2) used 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms instead of the canned. 3) omitted the brown sugar. 4) added about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to the sauce. 5) used 16 oz of ricotta instead of cottage cheese. 6) DIDN'T BOIL THE LASAGNA NOODLES!  This was definitely a hit!  By the way, if you've never made lasagna using the no-boil method, you really should give it a try.  Such a time saver and then you don't end up with wiggly, slippery, tearing wet noodles to handle.  Just make sure they are layered next to one of the wet ingredients (mine were right on top of the sauce layer) and they are perfect when the baking is done.",

Come on let's live a little. My guests loved that this was so flavorful. 2) Use fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms. I steamed the spinach with a little salt and it worked out fabulous 3) I used a can and a half of crushed tomatoes. Several of the other reviews advised using only one which is up to you. 4) I used lowfat ricotta instead of cottage cheese - much better Finally I sprinkled a little olive oil on the top of the lasagne and I got this wonderful crust.

The homemade red sauce is a little time consuming but definately worth it. I added an additional 2T of garlic 2T of itilian seasoning and 1T of onion powder to give it more flavor. I also used low fat cottage cheese and whole wheat noodles to make it even healthier. In order to prevent it from being runny I only partially cooked the noodles so they absorbed the additional fluid while cooking. My husband and his friends loved it they didn't mind that it was meatless.",

I was afraid that the spinach or zuchini might over power the dish but the flavors blended together nicely. The only change I made is that I didn't have enough tomatoes (or enough room in my pan) for the 2- 28 oz cans so I ended up using 1- 28 oz can and 1- 14 oz. It wasn't dry at all. That and I saved some mozzarella to top it off and covered it with foil while baking. My kids were a little hesitant because they could see the spinach (I told them it was parsley;) but they ended up finishing it without complaints. It has 8 WW points if you're counting. Delish!",

Maybe cooking it longer than 15 minutes and increasing the spinach filling would have helped. Also the veggies in the sauce almost disappeared. I might make it again with these changes. Thanks anyway.",
