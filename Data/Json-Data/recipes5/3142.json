I would suggest Not sauteing the spinach - it makes everything too watery. Instead add it to the pasta water just before the pasta is done - this will heat it and distribute evenly over the pasta. Then just saute the scallops in the garlic oil and lemon and mushrooms (if desired) - this will preserve their flavor. If I try this recipe again it will be like this.",
