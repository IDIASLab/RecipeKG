And I just put fresh mango's in the juicer to get the nectar. Enjoy! IMPORTANT juice your mango once its nice and soft it's sweet when it's soft and has a more sour taste when it's still a bit firm",

I substitute about 1/4 cup of Thai Sweet Red Chili Sauce for the honey and lemon juice and I puree a fresh mango in the food processor instead of using juice or nectar. After the chicken cooks I set it aside and stir-fry some broccoli then add the chicken back in with the sauce. At the very end I toss in some fresh mango slices just to warm them. I garnish with sliced red onion and chopped cilantro. Served with basmati rice this is a delicious meal!",

Instead of garlic powder I used 6 cloves of garlic and added them skillet along with some sliced baby bellas while I was browning my chicken. Also in lieu of mango nectar I used a mango smoothie that i found in a bottle in the cold juice aisle it had lemon juice in it so I omitted that from the recipe. I served it with Jasmine rice and sliced mango. My husband and 8 year old daughter both loved it. Will definately make again.",

I did use 1/2 cup balasmic dressing instead of straight vinegar and decreased the water to 1/2 cup. Also I just chopped up 1 whole mango. I liked the chunks.

I couldn't find Mango Nectar so I used Peach Nectar (I had trouble finding this in the store - but finally did find it in the international isle - near oriental foods). I bought 2 cans and it was more than enough. I didnt' change anything about the recipe except for using the peach nectar. As other reviewers noted - there is enough sauce for way more than 2 chicken breasts. I used 6 whole breasts (thin sliced) and still had too much sauce (for coating the chicken). Instead of simmering the chicken in the balsamic on the stovetop I put in the oven to heat through and it came out fine. I just left it in the oven for probably 20 mins or so at 350 while my sweet potatoes heated. This recipe was very good very sweet - a good change for a chicken recipe. It won't be on my regular weekly menu but definitely great for company or a special occasion where you want something a little different. Next time I will try with the Jamine rice that everyone refers to. Thank you for sharing your recipe!",
