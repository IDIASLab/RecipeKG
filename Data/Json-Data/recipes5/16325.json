However, the instructions didn't say anything about that.  I didn't have the particular spice, but it still had a good taste. My topping wasnt done even after 25 min, so I put it under the broiler for 2 1/2 min to crunch it up a bit.  The broccoli was still very hard. I don't like it mushy, but I do like it done.  Hubby liked it so if I make it again, I will par boil the broccoli a little first.  I will use less flour.  I will use slightly more milk, and more cheese.  It took more time to prepare and bake than suggested.",

I did so as I noticed that the mix was falling short of roux to cover the broccoli. I added salt too and it was just perfect! It's a pretty good recipe for using up an entire head of broccoli plus as a stand alone recipe, is very good meal on it's own. Just add crusty bread to clean up the plate.
