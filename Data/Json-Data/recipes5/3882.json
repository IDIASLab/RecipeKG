Didn't have tarragon replaced it with minced garlic on one batch and hot sauce on another, also did half lemon juice and half worcestershire, amazing! They are wet, added a little more cracker crumbs, chilled for an hour before cooking and coated them with italian bread crumbs, totaly amazing! I think the buttery crackers is the key ingredient in making these cakes taste so smooth.",

I did add old bay, used a little extra crabmeat and rolled them lightly in bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese because I wanted to seal in the flavor and wasn't sure if they would stay together properly without. I always had crab cakes with alot of bready type fillers and never really cared for them until I made these. Huge hit with hubby, can't wait to make them again!Thanks!",
