Would have given it a five had you punched up the flavor by marinating the asparagus first.\n\nTo marinate: Place the asparagus in a shallow baking dish, triple the lemon juice and olive oil, drizzle over the asparagus and marinate at room temperature for one hour, turning about three or four times. Then drain off the marinade and toss with the parmesan to coat. Be sure to use fresh Parmesan instead of the jarred type that has added salt and chemicals to keep it from lumping during storage.\n\nIf your grill doesn't have a grill plate use two bamboo skewers instead of one to thread asparagus spears for easy turning and to help keep the asparagus from slipping through the bars. Heck, whether you have a grill plate or not use the skewers for easy turning ;-)\n\nIf you're a garlic and lemon flavor lover add one teaspoon of minced garlic to the lemon and oil marinade.",
