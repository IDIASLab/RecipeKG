Also had no capers they're a bit pricey for me to use. Regardless this recipe tasted great! I used it for a Meatless Monday dinner and fried up some veggie egg rolls to go with. Boyfriend and I finished our plates and I am definitely game to cook bok choy again! Did not find this too vinegary or slimy like other reviews state. I think fresh ginger really helped make this dish. If you don't cook with it a lot it's OK. At the grocery store just break off a piece in the size you'll need.. You don't have to buy the whole root that you see. I get a piece that is smaller than 1 inch costs me less than 50 cents and I can make a couple dishes with it usually!:)",
