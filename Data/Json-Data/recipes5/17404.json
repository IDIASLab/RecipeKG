I've added cinnamon cocoa nutmeg and so far have yet made a bad cookie with this recipe. The only word of warning would be that it _may_ not store great for the 8 months mentioned. It will still make great cookies but the longer it sits it will lose something in the end result. But that's not the fault of the recipe. Thanks for this recipe!",
