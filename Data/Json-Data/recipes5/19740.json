It's my aunt's recipe from the 1970's (hence the 1 pound of butter) and therefore of uttermost decadence, but oh so addictive! I've made this recipe so many times, with so many compliments. I basically eyeball the measurements now  (I like a lot of cinnamon) but below is the original recipe.",

I made this today because I had been dreaming of crumb cake and really more about the crumb than the cake. I had some cherries on hand that were starting to become questionable in freshness and so I made a cream-cheese cherry pound cake (recipe from cookrepublic.com) for the cake part. Then when it was almost done baking I sprinkled the crumb topping--ALL OF IT-- onto the top of the cake. After baking it for about ten minutes more with the heat turned up to 400 degrees to brown the top I pulled the baked cake out of the oven and let it sit out for about two hours to cool and set. Then.......... I cut a slice for myself. Delicious! The crumb topping was perfect-- thick crisp slightly sweet and slightly nutty in flavor. A new favorite!",
