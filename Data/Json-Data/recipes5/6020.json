Sauteed some onions and mushrooms to have with these as well. Good stuff!",

Then I formed the patties and cooked at mealtime. I did cook longer because it started out cold from the fridge. My son and I loved them but my husband wasn't sure about the texture. I will definitely make again. Delicious flavor! Thanks for the recipe.",

I usually try to stick to the original recipe when trying something new when I can, but I didn\u2019t have parsley or cilantro, so I had to do my own spice blend. I also read that they can be a bit crumbly, so I mashed the veggie lentil mix thoroughly before adding eggs and bread crumbs, and they hold together very well. I made them in the shape of fish sticks so I could use them with our mini tortillas to cut down on bread. I even had a bit extra that wouldn\u2019t fit on the baking sheet and lightly fried it in a pan and it was delicious! I look forward to trying to make these again using the original recipe, but just know you can use your preferred spices and they will be lovely. Enjoy!",
