The only Tabouli I have ever had is from my local grocery store and love its refreshing taste but it cost four bucks for an 8 oz. container. I read the reviews and added an extra tomato and more onion and herbs. When the bulgur was ready to add it was a huge amount (swelled to twice as much)...much more bulger than vegtables which differs fromthe kind I like from my grocery store. So I just added about half of it to my veggie mixture. I don't know what traditional Tabouli is supposed to be like but prefer more veggies than the bulgur. I let this sit in the refrigerator overnight and it taste much better today...I do suggest making it a day ahead for the flavors to blend. It is a nice refreshing salad on a hot sunny afternoon. I will make again but only with half as much bulger wheat and twice as much vegetable/herb mixture.",

It seemed like more of a bulgur salad as opposed to tabouli where I expect the herbs to shine through more. The lemon overpowered the cilantro so much that cilantro wasn't the main flavor which is what I was hoping for. That being said it was good and healthy. I would make it again and just have different expectations!",
