The first time I made I followed the recipe and they were good but lacking in color. The second time I got a little more creative. I mixed the cheese with some powdered ranch mix to add a little flavor. I spread this on the tortillas and then sprinkled with olives and green chilies for a little extra color and taste. I will continue to make these when I need a quick and easy dish to take to work or to a potluck.",

But to add color I used a can of diced green chiles a jar of drained diced pimentos apprx 1/2c shredded cheddar cheese and apprx 1 TBLS minced green bell pepper. Pretty tasty. I might try other suggestions by using some taco seasoning next time. However based on how hot you like these I would add 1 tsp of hot sauce at a time until you achieve your desired heat. They were very \"pretty\"...and the taste wasn't too bad either. Thanks Darcy (good name:))!",
