There were two changes I made:  I used a different pasta (Trader's Vegetable Radiatore), and I used goat cheese rather than feta--personal preferences.  Otherwise, I did follow this recipe.  I prefer Trader Joe's marinated artichoke hearts because they aren't so overly wrought with salty flavor, and the sun-dried tomatoes were in a pouch already julienned.  It was totally excellent.  The chicken I used was already in tenders, so that made it even easier to make.  Excellent flavor!  I will definitely be making this dish on a regular basis!  Thank you so much, NELLIE73.",

I made it as closely to the recipe as possible and made a few notes to help out my teenage daughters should they want to make this again:  1) 1 package of penne for me is 16 oz--I've never seen 8oz boxes.  2) Broiling chicken breasts takes about 10-12 min per side in most ovens I've used, and 1 1lb is usually 2 breasts.  Use chicken tenderloin cuts to shorten this step and season heavily/cut into small cubes--way more than a pinch of seasoning.  I will likely marinate the breasts in Italian dressing for a few hours next time.  3) Sundried tomatoes are hard to get here in anything but the julienned and packaged in oil variety.  I used 1/2 C and blotted off most of the oil.  4) Garlic cloves vary by size.  I chopped up a few cloves for 1T garlic.",

One of the reasons I give it five stars is the flexibility! I added a bag of baby spinach, which was terrific and made it prettier. But you could really add any kind of veggie, or none. Flavor also super delicious, and easy and quick. I love the combination of lemon tartness and creaminess from the feta, though I actually used 1/2 and 1/2 feta and soft goat cheese, again because it's what I had.",
