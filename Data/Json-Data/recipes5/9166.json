I used Hong Kong style Wonton wrappers bought at a local Asian market and a mixture of water and cornstarch brushed on the edge to seal.  I think the cornstarch and water was really the key in keeping these suckers closed.  Also filled each with only a level teaspoon of filling.  Made about 30 total.   Be warned, they are a bit time consuming.  But worth it!",

Edit to original review:  We now bake these instead of frying them.  I cut a large egg roll wrapper into four squares using a pizza cutter and then tuck the squares into mini muffin cups and fill them with the cream cheese mixture.  I put them in the oven at 350 until the corners of the wrappers start to brown.  They are delicious that way.  Fried is still good, but doing it this way eliminates 80% of the work and it's worth it!",

They are already pre-baked so all I had to do was scoop a little filling in each reheat in oven for about five minutes and done. Saved ALOT of time by 1)Not having to wrap all those wontons and 2)Not having to fry them. Would suggest this as an alternative if you don't want to take the time or if you can't find the wrappers.
