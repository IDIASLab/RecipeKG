However, i added a mixture of Italian spices along with a teaspoon with a mixture of cottage cheese (small curd) and ricotta cheese, lessened the pepperoni by 1 slice for room and they turned out great with more of a truer calzone flavor. You can also leave out the sauce and use it for dipping.",

Just be careful not to overfill. I also used water on the edges to seal the calzone to prevent leakage. I sprayed the air fryer basket with cooking spray and used a mister filled with olive oil to spray the calzones. I baked at 370 degrees because my air fryer doesn't have the option of 375 degrees. Thank you Yoly for the great recipe!",
