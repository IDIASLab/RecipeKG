I did have some cotija cheese  in the fridge (more authentic for elotes, I believe),  so I did sub that for the parmesan.  Cotija is probably a difficult one to find in many areas, and I think parmesan would be equally good.  Full of flavor and quick and easy to make.  Kelsie, thanks for sharing, we enjoyed it.",
