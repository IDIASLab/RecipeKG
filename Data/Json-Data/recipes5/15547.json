I found the layers slid as I tried to roll it and it didn't turn out very pretty. I had the foresight to put the foil wrapped roll into a loaf pan and it's a good thing I did since the foil leaked a lot of liquid. I will make this again but layer the meat then beans tortillas cheese and the remainder of the meat in a loaf pan top it with the salsa and bake it for an hour. Oh and I only used half the beans in the meatloaf and served the rest on the side.",
