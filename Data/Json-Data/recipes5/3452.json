In my opinion the macadamia/bread crumb crust is not worth the trouble. Even when I increased the macadamia nuts and decreased the bread crumbs there still is no discernable taste that makes the several steps of making and applying the crust worth the effort. In the future I will just bake/broil/grill the sea bass and forget the crust. The mango cream sauce is another story. It is excellent and makes for a great presentation. I have made it several times with heavy cream and several with Cr\u00e8me fraiche. I have used slightly green mangos and ripe mangos. I prefer to use the ripe mangos and if you live in an area where you have an upscale market that sells Cr\u00e8me fraiche (pronounced Krem fresh ) there is no comparison. Always use it versus regular heavy cream.",

I used wild salmon filets, brushed them with garlic infused olive oil, sprinkled with red Hawaiian sea salt and black pepper, then applied the nut mixture directly to the fish and baked at 450 for 15 minutes.  Turned out spectacular; fish was moist and crust was toasted and slightly crunchy.  Omitted red pepper flakes from nut mixture, added freshly grated nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. of brown sugar.  Do not process nut mixture until smooth; that would make a paste, which would be bad. Pulse the mixture until it is light and crumbly, with plenty of nut chunks left, then apply lightly to fish without packing.  I used fat free half and half for the sauce, and added freshly grated nutmeg, 1/4 cup of mango nectar, and a splash of vanilla (the good stuff, please) to the mango sauce.  With fat free dairy and lemon juice your sauce will often separate or curdle; I pureed it at the end of cooking to smooth this out.  Served with saffron rice and steamed broccoli.  Next time I will use lime juice instead of lemon, and add a splash of coconut rum to the sauce.  This recipe is just too good to miss- Thank you Deanna!!!",

I served it on a large white platter with the sauce poured across the middle of each piece and garnished with mache and add'l chopped macadamia nuts. To really jazz up the mango flavor since it's not always easy to find a real flavorful mango, I added 1/4 cup of mango nectar to the chopped mango (easily available at most grocers). Served it with orzo that I cooked in chicken broth with a splash of white wine, the juice of half a lemon, and some chopped parsley. An outstanding dish with great presentation and flavor.",

I used mahi mahi because certain kinds of sea bass have been terribly overfished due to irresponsible fishing methods. There are many excellent alternatives to sea bass (Chilean sea bass has been particularly overfished) that are more known for sustainable fishing practices. Mahi mahi and pacific halibut both have wonderful textures to complement this dish. Thanks for the recipe I'll be making it again for sure!",

I love all kinds of fish so I knew it would be a keeper. Some substitutions I made: I used Del Monte jarred mango in extra light syrup because the store didnt have fresh. Also I was told at the fish market that sea bass is not in season right now so I used a nice fresh halibut fillet instead. I also used fresh garlic which makes a world of difference in any recipe. As I was making this hubby kept hanging around the kitchen - just smelled too good to keep him away! After pan searing it per the directions I baked it at 400 degrees for 15 min. (I had a pretty thick halibut fillet so 350 would have taken forever) and that was perfect. After adding the macadamia crust I broiled it for about a minute. Any longer and it would have burned but it came out perfect!! The fish the crust and the mango sauce all work so well together. I sauteed up some zuchinni and made mushroom risotto as my sides. I can't wait to try the recipe again with sea bass. I'm going to make this for my parents for their anniversary its that good. FYI - Definitely use macadamias - even though they can be expensive the flavor is worth it!",

                "reviewBody": "This was the first time I've had chilean sea bass and I was excited to try this recipe but was left completely disappointed (and broke)! I followed the recipe almost exactly however it came out flavorless and greasy (possibly due to the oils in the crust) I certainly loved the texture of the fish itself but the crust and creamy sauce overwhelmed the dish and made it shockingly unhealthy. For those of you who will insist on trying this recipe please due so first with a much less expensive cut of fish to see if you like it. And do not put vanilla extract in the mango sauce as others have suggested. The extract made it taste like a dessert sauce (although it tasted delicious on the scoop of vanilla ice cream I had afterward.) For a fish like this less is definately more. Do yourself a favor and save the time and money for something else. Prepare with a bit of olive oil white wine salt pepper lemon juice and parsley. It will cost less and taste much better",
