A little expensive but well worth the money! Wait till the grocery store has a sale and stock up on these bad boys! ",

Two tips: use kitchen shears to cut the shell, and make sure to cut half way through the meat lengthwise where you cut the shell and butterfly it so it cooks in the middle.  Took a bit longer than stated, but that could have been the size of tails I got or heat of the grill.  Make sure to baste constantly to keep it moist.  And watch out for flareups when the oil drips into the grill (keep a spray bottle handy).",
