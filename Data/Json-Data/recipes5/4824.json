It may take a little longer to heat through, but no other changes needed in the directions.\n\nGreat for leftovers the next day - if you have any!",

I am not the biggest fan of \"normal\" Green Bean Casseroles w/ the Cream of Mushroom soup & fried onions on top so I've been wanting to find something different. And this is it! I did everything as is except for I threw in some left-over ham & didn't do so much butter for the topping. (due to previous reviews) I did a couple Tblspoons of marg & crushed cornflakes. DELISH!!! A note though... The ham took it over the top!!! BUT if you use the ham you may want to tone down the salt. We liked it but I'm sure a lot of people would have thought it was a bit salty. THANKS for this recipe!! This is one I will be making OFTEN!:)",
