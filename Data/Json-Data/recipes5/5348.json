The only thing we thought it lacked was salt, but we add that at the table anyway.  We did make a couple of changes in this.  The flounder fillets I had to work with were incredibly thin and I was afraid the double breading would overwhelm it.  So I skipped dipping it in the egg and the second dredging.  The single layer of flour coating turned out to be plenty, but with a thicker fish it would be better with the extra breading and would probably deserve the 5.  I also cut way back on the amount of oil I used.  I used only 1/4 cup and got it VERY hot before I added the fillets.  Cooked in a flash and worked very well.",
