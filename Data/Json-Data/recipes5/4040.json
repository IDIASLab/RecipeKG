I tried the dressing before adding it to the pan and found it bitter (could be because I eye-balled the lemon juice) so I just added a dash of sugar.  First time I've eaten endive and I will make it again! UPDATE: I had to change my four stars to five stars because my mom and I were craving this recipe so I made it again and this time measured everything exact and didn't add the sugar and everyone at home loved this recipe!

The issue is the dressing which is too sour and only highlights the bitterness in the endive. Dressing needs to be sweetened with maybe honey or maple syrup. Or alternatively make the dressing a little creamier with a touch of yogurt. The dressing just needs to be rounded out somehow.",

This dish called for pine nuts which I planned on subbing (allergy reasons) with sunflower seeds. However I also made an orzo side tonight and while cooking my phone rang and dopey me put the sunflower seeds into that dish instead. Realizing my mistake I quickly cooked up some bacon in the microwave and sprinkled it over the salad. Believe it or not I really do have a point to my review which is how much we all loved this simple yet wonderful recipe. This was my first attempt using endive (always heard it was bitter-not so cooked like this) and I'm thrilled I did because my family absolutely loved it in spite of the deletion/addition factors. The bacon added a nice touch so next time I'll be using both ingredients. Thanks so much \"A c r h\"!!!!",
