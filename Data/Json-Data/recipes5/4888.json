I used some hot sauce, chili flakes and chili powder instead of the harissa as it seemed wasteful to make up a batch of it (even a small one) for just a teaspoon. The heat was still present, just less so. I used lemon pepper instead of regular black pepper. Substituted a finely diced green onion for the sweet onion called for. I used 3 tablespoons each of the orange juice and white wine thinking that it might 'steam' some of those flavours into the fish, but I didn't notice them.",

It turned out great but I know using smoked paprika and harissa will make it that much better. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the onions I will put more on next time. It should be browned more than the current picture is showing it should be more like the authors' picture with dark brown spots. Mine was only browned well in spots and those were the best spots. I put some sauce on before onions and lemon and then put the remaining on top of the onions and lemon. I will definitely be hunting down some smoked paprika and making this again. My salmon was about 3/4\" thick - I'm not sure if thinner salmon would work as well because with reduced cooking time the onions wouldn't be cooked. FYI - I used Kraft Light Miracle Whip. Served it with brown rice edamame and a fresh lemon wedge.",

We also have a high tolerance for heat, so increased the amount of harissa just a bit.  It's nice that this can have slight modifications and still be great.  I used Mina Harissa Spicy Traditional Moroccan Red Pepper Sauce.  This is a keeper.  I served with pearl couscous  with lemon zest mixed in and a simple roasted cauliflower.   Cut the onions and lemon slices very thin  - so very, very good.",
