Whipped up cajun seasoning (from a cookbook recipe) by using 2 parts black pepper, 1 part ground cayenne, 1 part cumin, 1 part nutmeg and a dash of salt.  Used yellow onion, not white and I think the beef was just round or 'hamburger'.  Didn't have pepperjack slices, so used provolone.  The mayo made a great topper.  One of the best burgers we've ever had.",

I roughly cut my jalapenos and onions since it doesnt bother me but other people might want to finely chop their vegetables. I really love spicy food so next time i might add hot sauce/tabasco to the meat or something. If you arent a lover of spicy foods heres a tip: the heat of a jalapeno is within the membrane inside it so if you remove that it wont be as hot. Also 1/2 cup of mayonnaise was alot. I think i used about a couple teaspoons per burger. You'll probably only need 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup. Next time and there definately will be i might add a little more seasoning to the mayo.",
