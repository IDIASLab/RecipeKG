Not super sweet, that is where the jam comes into play so take that into consideration when selecting your filling, which really makes them good.  I followed the directions to the tee BUT increased the second baking time to 15 minutes which makes a big differance.  I didn't raise the temp as this cookie needs to cook slow so the jam doesn't get out of control.  It is skimpy so quadrupling it is my suggestion.  A great christmas cookie.  I didn't need to chill the dough at all. This will remain a Christmas regular.",

I got 3 bakers dozen from this recipe, measuring my dough about 2 tsp per cookie. \n\nUSE BUTTER. I cannot stress this enough. This is a shortbread cookie. It is not sweet, it will not spread, it will crumble slightly if cooked properly. Also, cream vanilla into butter/sugar/yolk. Most bakers already know to mix their wet, then mix the dry in a separate bowl and add to wet, but a novice baker might not.\n\nCHILL FINISHED DOUGH before shaping into balls. \n\nALLOW COOKIE BALLS TO WARM to room temperature before pressing your fingerprint. Cold dough will crack and make your cookie brittle.\n\nFILL BEFORE BAKING. After cooking for 5 min, my cookies had a crust that broke and left a brittle cookie with ugly bare streaks. When I pre-filled, the cookies were smoother, but had no coating because my daughter needed a nice looking batch for her bf. I will test this again with black sesame for good photo contrast and because it's yummy. :)\n\nBAKE FOR 15 MIN AT 300. I also lined my pan with ungreased foil, it makes it easier to move to cooling rack and keeps the bottom from burning.\n\nCOOL THOROUGHLY BEFORE TOUCHING. The filling is HOT. YOU WILL GET BURNED. And it's just not fun to run to the sink with jam hardening onto your skin.\n\nThese would be a great project for kids over 3 to help with. Just make sure they don't poke through the bottom!",

I find them to be a lot of work; chopping the nuts up fine; rolling the dough in balls then dipping them in egg whites then nuts. I triple the recipe because my oldest son can wipe out a batch just by himself. I use almond extract in lieu of vanilla and I use the bottom of a wooden spoon to indent the cookies then I redent them after I remove them from the oven. I have never tried putting the jelly in prior to baking; perhaps I will give it a try this year. Also I use blackberry; grape; and strawberry jelly. Apple hasn't been as well received when I've used it. These are not my favorite cookies because I think they're more trouble than they are worth but I only make them once a year and my family so loves them and that is what Christmas is all about family and love.",
