I like ginger, but biting into a small chunk of crystallized ginger gives the kind of hot sensation you get from eating Thai food--not exactly what I'm looking for in a cookie.  Homemade treats usually disappear quickly at my office, but I couldn't find any takers for these overwhelming cookies.  If I were to make these again, I'd definitely omit the crystallized ginger.",

                "reviewBody": "I have made this recipe twice in the last week. Wow! These cookies are good! Thank you, Laria. \n\nI did modify the recipe the second time I made them. In the first batch I used butter and  followed the recipe almost exactly. I used an entire jar of McCormick's crystallized ginger (about 2+ oz) ground in a food processor. Clearly that was much less than the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe, but at over $8/jar, who can afford that for a batch of cookies?    I did not compensate with any extra fresh or powdered ginger but they still tasted very good. They did, however, come out flat and soft and those that survived my family for a few days got softer and stuck together as time went on. \n\nFor the second batch, I used Crisco butter-flavored shortening,and doubled the amount of fresh ginger and powdered ginger. When I tasted the uncooked batter  I was worried that I had produced an inedible ginger kick-in-the-head but those cookies were incredible. The batter was much easier to work with--not sticky, it was easy to shape in uniform round balls that produced perfectly shaped round raised cookies with a cracked surface. Once baked, the cookies were crispy but not hard and intensely gingery without a bite. \n\nI am writing this, my first review, to save myself from eating the rest of the cookies. Fortunately, I gave most of the batch away yesterday for a \"ghosting.\"",

If you keep your ginger root frozen, you can grate it quickly without peeling it because the skin falls to the side as you grate. I reduced the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp. to keep the saltiness down.   If you like to add other spices to these cookies, you should try cardamom or five-spice powder.",

I ended up tripling (actually probably more than that) on ground ginger and grated fresh ginger. I also found ground wet ginger near the minced garlic and used 2 teaspoons of that as well. (I'm a HUGE ginger fan.)\r\n   These came out soft, moist and cake-like which I love. I can appreciate a crunchy cookie, but I like my ginger cookies soft. \r\n   Beautiful cookies! Will definitely make again. Though mine did stick to the cookie sheet. I will have to lightly grease it next time. Thanks Laria!",
