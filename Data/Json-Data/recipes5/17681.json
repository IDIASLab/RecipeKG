I'll make more of the filling next time though. I guess I'm too generous with the goo. As a holiday twist you could color the dough to make little wreaths or you could sprinkle colored sugars on the dough as you are rolling the balls. I used red and green sugar (not enough to cover just enough to speckle the dough.) The cookies looked quite festive but were not sweetened too much. It was a great addition to a wonderful cookie.",
