Moist, just the right amount of spices, and very delicious.  I only made two changes. One is to add 1 cup of chocolate chips along with the cranberries (nuts would also be nice). If you don't do this, you might want to double the cranberries. The second is to only bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes. 400 is just too hot for muffins, I think. They came out perfect at 350.",

They were so good (compared to another recipe that I tried from this site) that I had to write a negative review about the other. Only changes I made were substituting one cup of whole wheat Pastry flour to mix with one cup of the all-purpose flour adding a bit more of the cranberries decreasing the ginger (b/c I'm not a fan of ginger) increasing the nutmeg (b/c I like nutmeg more than ginger) made my own puree and instead of buttermilk I added 1/4 whole milk and 1/4 half & half (b/c I had it). These will be a regular fall/winter treat in our household!!!! Kudos Robin L.!!",
