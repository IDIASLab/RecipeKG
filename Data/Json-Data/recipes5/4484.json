I server it with a side of grilled chicken breast and it's complete. Some posters have commented on the overpowering of the lemon juice but I totally have to disagree. It's absolutely perfect as the recipe states. It's also delicious if you throw in some diced cucumber. If I had to live off of one meal for the rest of my life this would be it! I bring it to every party I go to and always carry a few copies of the recipe because at least one person asks for it!",
