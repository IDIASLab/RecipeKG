I've served it a number of times and everybody is quite surprised about it.  I use deep sea perch fillet or sometimes cod fillet, but any other fish with this kind of texture is alright to use (don't use an oily fish like salmon or trout).  For mustard, try not to use sweet mustard, because the bananas are sweet already and the dish might end up too sweet.  Serves well with rice.",

I used whole-grain mustard and a previously frozen overripe banana and added extra milk when the sauce was too thick. The soft bananas blended well into the sauce once cooked and the result was such a different and delicious surprise. My husband kept raving and even talked more about it today. The tasty sauce let the mild fish flavor come through. This recipe is worth a try.",
