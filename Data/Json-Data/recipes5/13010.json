Oh! And I also used a reduced fat mayonnaise. YUM! This was excellent! My littlest inhaled his own sandwich and then took half of mine. No leftovers. It's GONE. Thanks for a new favorite chicken salad sandwich! NOTE FOR SELF: Next time I think I'd add in more relish and some chopped celery just to stretch it a bit more to get one more sandwich. That's really for us not reflective of the recipe.",
