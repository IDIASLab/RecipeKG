I loved the subtle sweetness the wine added to the tomato. For whatever reason, I thought of those flavors while brainstorming a quick skirt steak marinade, and this is what happened. Skirt steak is always great on the grill and doesn't need much help, but I love how this came out.",

I followed the recipe exact, but the next day i took the left over beef cut it into small pieces then put them in a bowl with flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper then browned the meat in a skillet with olive oil. I then added the mushrooms and onions (also left over) 2 potatoes cut into small pieces 3 carrots and 3 stalks of celery, covered with low sodium beef broth cooked until vegis were done. Great beef stew i will always use this marinade for beef stew, it was perfect. Thank you chef John. What flavor!!!!",
