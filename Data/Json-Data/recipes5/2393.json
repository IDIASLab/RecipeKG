Also subbed in white chocolate instant pudding mix to keep the batter whiter. I used 25 drops of red food coloring for the red layer and still had pink batter & 15 drops of blue gave a light blue. Will use even more next time. The frosting recipe does not say to sift the powdered sugar before measuring but I did since most frosting recipes I've used say to do that. Perhaps because of that I only needed 1/2 c. heavy cream to get the frosting to a spreadable consistency. Even so I had enough frosting for the cake with a little left over. My guests were impressed & the cake was delicious.",
