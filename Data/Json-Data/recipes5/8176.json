I fried some up in the deep  fryer and the beer batter coating came off.  That's when I found this recipe and I made one for myself, just to make sure they would turn out alright. Way better than any store-bought or take-out battered cod, ever! The only adjustment I made was that I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil because that's all I had on hand.  Thank you!",

We have a freezer full of Halibut from our Alaska trip this summer and I wanted to replicate a delicious meal we had at the beach this past weekend at a nice Chinese restaurant.  Crispy Halibut with Ginger-Scallion sauce.  \nI used Panko  (white) bread crumbs from Wegmans.  I also used peanut oil because I like the flavor. \nMy fillets are big because the  halibut we caught was 135 pounds. \nI dipped the  fillets in the egg and then the panko crumbs and oil mixture and into the air fryer basket  for 25 mins. \nThey were fantastic.   This  is a wonderful recipe. I am so happy I found it.  I can now have crispy Halibut when ever I want.",
