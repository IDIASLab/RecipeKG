His and his co-workers' comments were that they loved it, and that it was very cheesy but they didn't mind that.  Two men suggested having jarred sliced jalapenos on the side for those wishing to add them.  One man said you could substitute venison for the \"hamburger\" meat, that's when hubby 'fessed up about the buffalo meat (undetected by all).  He did have to significantly increase the baking time, perhaps because it had been refrigerated prior to baking. The only change I made was decreasing the water by half because I didn't want runny cream cheese, and 1/8 cup water worked very well.  Hubby said that because of all the melted cheese, it was hard to dip a tortilla chip into the dip, so he grabbed a metal teaspoon, placed several tortilla chips on his plate and spooned the dip onto the chips, and other men began doing likewise.  They scraped the pan clean! This was easier to make than the traditional 7-layer taco dip, and serving it heated was nice also.",
