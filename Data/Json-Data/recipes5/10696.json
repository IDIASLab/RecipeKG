I love these short ribs over mashed potatoes, but the rich tomato and mushroom gravy is fantastic over soft polenta as well. I really hope you give this cool weather wonder a try.",

I was not able to find bone in beef ribs in any of 4 local grocery stores.    I settled on a 2 pound package of boneless ribs. Following Chef John's recommendation on the Sherry ribs, I browned them very well in some bacon fat.  I  drained and reserved the bacon, then set the ribs aside to drain on some paper towels.  I diced 2 medium onions and sauteed them with some minced garlic.  I added the 2 TBSP flour called for in the Sherry recipe as well as the bay leaf, cayenne  and rosemary from the mushroom recipe.  I de-glazed the pan with about a cup of port rather than the sherry.  Followed that with about 2 cups of beef broth and a can (14 oz) of tomato puree.  I added back the bacon and ribs and brought to a low boil. Rather than putting in the oven, I simmered on top of the stove in a cast iron dutch  oven with a tight lid for around 2- 2 1/2 hours.  I let it cool down and refrigerated over night.  The next day, I skimmed the fat that had solidified then simmered for another 2 hours or so on the stove.  I left the pot only about half covered to let the sauce reduce.  Served with mashed potatoes and butter braised brussels sprouts.   It was SOOOO good!   Since there are only 2 of us, we had plenty of lefties.  Even better left over with some candied carrots and white rice!",

I use boneless short ribs and trim a bit of fat, but not all, from them.  He says any tomato product works for the sauce, but using  San Marzano crushed tomatoes from Italy adds a wonderful depth of flavor.  Straining the porcini liquid through a coffee filter  prevents any grit in the mix. Served over mashed potatoes or polenta is a must for these.  Baby green peas as a side dish completes the presentation.",
