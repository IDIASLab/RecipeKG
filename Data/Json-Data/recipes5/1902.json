They make a yummy butter, and go great over toast or bisquits.  For those of you who have never made homemade butter, it takes some time.  You will first get whipping cream, and then the cream will start to form chunks.  Beat until the butter forms one large chunk, and the butter turns a light yellow.  There will be leftover buttermilk, which you can save for later use.  IMPORTANT** After draining excess buttermilk off of the butter, rinse the butter in cold water.  Get as much of the excess buttermilk off as you can.  If you don't do this, the butter will spoil in the fridge.",

I would start out on slow and increase as it thickens.  When it goes to whipped cream, I take some out for toppings.  When it starts turns into buttermilk, I save it to use on pancakes.  Then keep beating until it turns to butter draining all the liquid.\r\nMake sure you start out slowly or else it will splash all over.  This way is a lot easier and less tiring.

My mom taught me to wash butter by draining off the milk liquids then running COLD water into the jar and pressing the butter with the back of a spoon to release pockets of butter milk trapped inside of the butter. It takes several washings to get it completely clean. If you are eating all of the butter within a short amount of time washing is not so crucial.",

Also since it is so hard to shake it that long here are some tips: If you are using a plastic container add a marble or two and the process will be a lot faster. If you are using a glass container you can use a marble if you are really careful but it can break the glass. I have used about 5 clean paperclips instead and it works well in a glass container. Just remember to fish out the marble/paperclips when you have your butter!!!",
