It has a wonderful fresh flavor and mine was on the chunky side which everyone liked.  The main modification that I made was the amount of Jalapenos.  I listened to some other reviewers and used only 1/2 of a pound of jalapenos and the seeds from only 3 of them (it was about 12 jalapenos for the 1/2 pound). It was very spicy at that.  1/2 pound was just about right....spicy and just hot enough to be flavorful but not so hot that it is unbearable. It does leave a little burn on your tongue but I thought it was exactly right I don't think that anyone that I know could actually eat this concotion if you used the full pound of jalapenos and used the seeds as well.  I would definitely suggest to start on the low side and add jalapenos as needed to your taste.  \r\nAlso, I followed this recipe exactly and measured out the tomatos, etc....It only made 3/4 of a gallon instead of 1 1/2 gallons that the recipe states.  I didn't boil it very long either. \r\n\r\nMy other substitution was lime juice for the lemon juice...I prefer the taste of lime.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I loved this and have been asked to make someone a batch for Christmas.  I will be keeping this recipe in a safe place.  Love it!!!",

I did use fewer jalepenos, because I used the seeds when I chopped them.  Next time I think I will deseed some of them, and include more jalepenos for their great taste, but not all their spice.  I also added more cilantro, because that's what our tastes like.  I plan on passing this one out canned, and making more!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",
