I made them again the very next weekend they were so great! The only change I made (on accident) was instead of making the cilantro oil and then the chipotle vinaigrette seperatly I made it all together (so it was Chipotle Cilantro Vinaigrette). It tasted great and I didn't see a reason to keep them seperate if you're going to pour both on the shrimp. Just be sure to grill the shrimp long enough. I was concerned I would over do it and pulled the first batch off the grill a little early. Make sure the pancetta (Italian bacon) is nice and done and the shrimp will be perfect.",

I will only use fresh sliced pancetta from the deli as the packaged sliced proved to be \"brittle\" and would not wrap around the shrimp. I used uncooked shrimp with this. I also used prosciutto I had on hand with cooked shrimp which was good also. These needed to only warm through. I cooked all in the broiler second shelf from the top and watched carefully so it would not burn. Line a pan with foil and use a wire rack so the pancetta can drip down. The recipe makes ample sauce for later use as a great dressing for a spinach salad with the shrimp tossed over it. Next time I'll try just the Chipotle sauce on the salad as I like spicy things.",
