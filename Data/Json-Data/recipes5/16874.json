Also Iwas worried that the cinnamon in the raisin bread might be too much but again It was great. Even my guests who don't like raisins loved this stuffing so don't be affraid to try it.",

That being said I don't know how thick the bread slices are supposed to be but some of the ingredient amounts seemed off. I used 12 thin slices which was almost the whole little loaf. There were way too many cranberries and too much onion. I used maybe 3/4 cup onion and added 1 stalk of celery. The liquid amount was perfect though. Will definitely use this again. 11/08 Update: I now use this recipe as a base and love it. I use half raisin bread and half cube stuffing mix which cuts a bit of the sweetness. I add celery use less onion and a small amount of dried cranberries instead of all those fresh/frozen cranberries.",

I used fresh cranberries and instead of using raisin bread I used whole wheat bread and added raisins-- it's wonderful they plump up and get soooo juicy! I had some problems with it drying out and had to add water frequently. The first time I made it I used it to stuff a pumpkin but the second time I made it as a dish all its own. Fantastic!",

The only deviations I made were to use 1/4 cup butter and chicken broth (it's what I had in the fridge) rather than vegetable. Honestly I tasted it before putting the dish into the oven and I had major concerns that it was going to be too sweet. However the tartness of the cranberries (I have a couple bags frozen) balances out the sweetness perfectly IMO. Just a couple comments. If you have access to \"ground rosemary \" I'd recommend you use it. My husband said the rosemary tasted a little like \"sticks.\" Also I will cut the chopped onion and cranberries back to about a cup each in the future. Many people only make stuffing for Holidays but it's a nice side dish any time of year even during the dog days of August. Thanks Ibby we enjoyed your stuffing served with pork chops and probably will make it again for Thanksgiving adding some sausage and maybe a little chopped celery.",
