My only critique would be that it seemed a little oily/greasy so perhaps cutting the margarine content to less than 1/2 cup would yield a better consistency. Taste is excellent however the texture is the only problem I am having. Also I am refrigerating the frosting to see if it yields a less greasy result after cooling completely.",
