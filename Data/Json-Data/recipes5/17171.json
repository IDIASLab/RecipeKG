I added a few dashes of Worchestershire sauce about 3 table spoons of Texas Pete a couple shakes of Cajun seansoning a dash of A1 and since I didn't have any honey I used Caro syrup. Oh and I did add extra onion and doubled the garlic like the others did. It was great! It had a more BBQ flavor and had a little kick to it but not too much! Served it over rice.
