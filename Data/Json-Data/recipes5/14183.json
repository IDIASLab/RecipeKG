I changed out the lard for water lowering the fat content and added orange based on flavors I found in restaarants in Mexico.  American tastes have added a tremendous amount of flavor enhancers(spices, chilies, etc. to the dish).  You can make this into whatever you want.  I prefer it crisped up in a little oil after it's shredded into chunks( and a little extra kosher salt sprinkled over it.  If you want more spice add this at this time.",

                "reviewBody": "Ken, this is a winner, a five star!  I bought that huge package from Costco that contains about 15 lbs of boneless pork shoulder.  That meat is a pain in the neck to cook with because of all the fat, but it's the fat that makes it tasty, too, so I endure the misery of cutting it off.  I actually cooked this according to directions in my Magnalite roaster on stovetop, and it took two batches to get the job done.  For the first batch I used all the salt, and then the second batch I used half that amount.  For my family, it will probably rest in between the two amounts.  Otherwise, the ingredients are just perfect because one flavor doesn't outdo another, and the resulting meat is very yummy.  I made a double batch of Mexican Rice II from this site to go with it, and I used the broth from the meat for half of the recipe.  Next time I will use the broth for ALL of it because it makes a spectacular replacement for the chicken broth, adding a depth of flavor to the rice that can't be duplicated.  Now I am glad that I saved the broth for my freezer for future uses.  What a perfect recipe!  Thank you!",

When I serve it, to give it the same \"texture\" as my favorite mexican restaurant, (without the added calories) I put meat on a sheet pan and throw in a very hot oven for just a few minutes. Gives it the crispy edges that I love.   Wonderful recipe Ken- Thanks!!!",

I had went online to browse lots of different ways of making this; some people simmered in lard some peanut oil and I didn't like either of those methods so I used this recipe and was not dissapointed. I did take advice I found for adding a can of cola to the water; or you could add a can of beer. After two hours I took off the lid took out oranges and bay leaves then turned up the heat and let the liquid cook down; it took about 15 minutes and then I let the meat brown in it's own fat... Delicious! Thanks for the awesome recipe Ken!:) Tip: wait until you've skimmed fat off top before adding all the spices... they tend to float too.",

Trust me it was worth it. It's probably 30 mins away from removing from the oven. My daughter and I couldn't resist (I mean the SMELL is amazing) So when I went to turn it we picked off some done parts and threw them in the skillet with onions and peppers. We ate this on homemade tortillas with cheese. (I'm stuffed) It will have taken it 6 hrs. and 15 minutes at 325. I cut the yucky stuff off. Cut the oranges onion and 1 lime in the bottom of my roasting pan ( I would have thrown the bay leaves in here but I didn't have any.) I made a rub of the kosher salt (and yes there is a huge difference. It will be too salty with table salt) cumin garlic and peppercorns. I turned it a couple of hours after sticking it in. Before it all fell apart I got the fruit and most of the onion and pepper corns out of the broth and added another cup of water. It wasn't quite totally off the bone last time I checked but it had been shredded into the flavorful broth and I'm looking forward to enjoying this for quite awhile. Thanks Ken. AWESOME recipe.",
