Also I found neck bones (beef) at my local grocer Market Basket for you New Englanders. I even tried my favorite butcher (40 mile drive) and he said he was having trouble getting any type of bones.

I can't leave a pot on for 18 hours (who wants to leave the house with a burner on?) so I now simmer mine in a slow cooker instead. Not as perfect but if it means you actually MAKE it then it can be forgiven. Veal bones can also be very hard to find. If you must use large beef bones. No it won't be the same but as I said if it's a choice between compromising or not doing it....",
