The dough was very much like a quick bread batter very soupy so I added 3 cups of Oatmeal to make this recipe just a bit more healthy than the origional and to give it a little more body. I did chill as suggested and the cookies came out wonderful very cake like and chewy.",

Then I used 1 1/4 cups sugar instead of 2 cups.  I used half whole wheat flour, half white and omitted the walnuts (personal taste).  I also added 1 1/4 cups oatmeal and 1/4 cup wheat germ, just for the sake of trying it.  They turned out great, with a nice cakey texture to them. A day later, the cookies had dried out significantly, so maybe  cook less than usual so they remain moist (?)",

The cookies spread but not as much as I thought they would considering the consistency of the dough. They definitely end up a cake like cookie. I didn't think I'd like these that much because of the coffee flavor (it's sort of an aftertaste int hese) but I figured bf would. He said they were okay. Not really something I'd make again but I'm glad I could try. Thanks for the recipe.",
