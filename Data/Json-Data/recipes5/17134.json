My twist was to mix 1 tsp. cinnamon to brown sugar before I spread over the butter and I also added 1/4 cup shredded coconut after I layered the cherries and pineapples. It came out great and my husband could not wait for it to cool! He pleaded for a piece before it had solidified. He said \" Damn babe this is good\" his highest rating :). So thanks Anne, hope I can repay you.\n-UPDATE 6/17/03\nI made this for our family doctor as a thank you for his extraordinary care and compassion, he loved it, wanted to run away with me-hahahha. \n10/02/2005-For gifts, I now use both rings and crushed pineapple and place cherries in each ring and in gaps. Cake is gorgeous this way and each ring is a slice. I bake in two cake pans to make two cakes-one to give and one to keep.11/06-New Twist, we soak the drained crushed AND ring pineapple in RUM, drain and then use. OMG :)",

Substitute ALL (or as much as you have on hand) water for pineapple juice. Add small pineapple chunks (daubed dry) and a dash of vanilla to your batter. Use salted butter if at all possible. It adds a nice contrast to the heavy sugar. Add a dash of cinnamon atop your brown sugar. And believe it or not, pear halves make an excellent accompaniment to the pineapple rings in this cake. Lastly, use a cast iron skillet if possible. This makes a great subtle crust.",

Each of the ladies took a second helping and asked me for the recipe!  I chopped up the leftover fresh pineapple that I had grilled as a side dish last night in lieu of the canned variety.  Because I did not have any pineapple juice to use in the cake mix, I used half water and half rum (~1/3 cup rum for a total of 2/3 c. liquid).  This added a very nice \"adult\" flavor.  I used a yellow cake mix and skipped the cherries.  Next time I might add some pecans to the bottom before baking.  Did require about an extra 10-15 minutes to bake.",

                "reviewBody": "I had some problems with this recipe. First off, how big of an iron skillet has everyone got!?! Mine is 9\" and I had enough cake batter to make nearly a dozen cupcakes after I'd put what I needed into the upside-down cake. I was glad I followed another reviewer's suggestion to put a cookie sheet under the cake while it baked because butter and sugar bubbled up and over the edges and would have been a mess in the oven. When I flipped the cake over onto my platter, there was a crust of still crystalized brown sugar all over the top, it never dissolved, so I think the amount of brown sugar called for is too much (and I only used 1 cup!). The cake mix makes it too sweet also. All in all, it was edible, but I think I'll keep looking.",
