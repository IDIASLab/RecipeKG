        "description": "This is the result of my quest for perfectly creamy and flavorful hummus. We have many Middle Eastern restaurants in metro Detroit and I've always wanted to perfect the recipe at home. The secret to ultimate creaminess with this recipe is the Vitamix&reg; blender, which really emulsifies the mixture so it's not grainy. Using a food processor in the past, it never came out smooth. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and lightly garnish with a dash of paprika or minced parsley if desired. Sprinkle toasted pine nuts on top when serving for a savory variation. Great with fresh baked pita, pretzels, or sliced vegetables.",

I made it as the recipe called for and it was perfect!  It is very easy to add more lemon or garlic or any other ingredient you prefer. It was a bit warm after adding the saut\u00e9ed garlic but I couldn\u2019t wait to eat it! I set aside a fair amount for me and refrigerated the rest for sunset appetizers. I will make this again and again while at sea AND on land. This is a recipe I will gladly pass along to other sailors!! DELISH!",
