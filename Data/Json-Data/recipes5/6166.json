It's wonderful!  It was a little heavy on cilantro, but I wasn't even turned off by it.  People who don't care for that taste in every bite should probably cut the amount to 3/4 or even half a bunch.  I made do with just ground cinnamon.  I HIGHLY recommend the optional quinoa (note: it does absorb a lot of the broth so you may want to add 2 more cups of stock after adding the quinoa), and I added hot kielbasa sausage for my Hunny, which I saut\u00e9ed with the onions, and the sausage soaked up the flavors of the spices and broth rather than staying hot.  Next time I might consider adding chopped spinach for the sake of some green nutrition because I think the other flavors would easily mask that bitter \"green\" taste some people dislike (like my toddler ;).  This is such a great staple to have in my recipe box that I can add to and modify as I like.",

I added 2 lbs of Italian pork sausage (because that's what I had) cooked up with spices and the onion. I added fresh green beans cut into 1/4 inch pieces, corn and fresh tomatoes along with 2 cups of dry mixed lentils and no canned beans. I didn't add quinoa, because I didn't have any on hand right now, but love the cilantro in it. This is a great base recipe, you can leave it as is or add to it as you want to. I would have liked to have some seasoned diced tomatoes in the pantry, but the fresh turned out fine (and are healthier, too). I had limes, in lieu of lemons, and squeezed them on top, but lemon would probably give better flavor to this recipe. I'm going to add a dallop of sour cream to mine... Either way, it's hard to go wrong. Mine is good, but I look forward to trying this again when I have more of the original recipe ingredients on hand. Don't be afraid to mix it up!",
