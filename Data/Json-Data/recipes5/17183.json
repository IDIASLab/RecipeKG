I used regular not quick cooking oats for the crust and that didn't work out that well so next time I'll get quick oats or premade crust but the filling was perfect. For the reviewer who's pie didn't set - whipping the whipping cream before folding it in is an important step it won't set if you don't do that. I will definitely make this again.",
