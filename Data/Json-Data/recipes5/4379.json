I have never had red onion when I made this, so I have used yellow and even frozen pre-chopped onion, and both work fine. If you are looking for a little heartier recipe, you can add garbanzo or cannellini beans and even that doesn't mess it up. I have used chicken broth in place of the white wine too. The one tip that I figured out while making it is to cut the chard stems into pretty thin pieces so they will be tender--after the first time I cooked it, when my chard stems turned out a little tough, I started cutting them into 1/4- to 1/8-inch pieces, and that worked a lot better. Rainbow chard makes a really nice presentation, too. This is the first recipe that has ever inspired me to write a review on this site--I never knew my family would eat chard, so that alone makes this recipe a keeper!",

I fried up 2 slices of chopped up bacon with the olive oil/butter mixture and cooked the onions a little longer than called for in the recipe and the carmelized flavor gave it a nice depth. Also, I threw in about a half a cup of minced carrots with the onions because they were going to go bad in the fridge if I didn't. So I added the garlic after the onions and carrot were happy so it didn't burn. I will use this recipe again and again!!!",

I added about 1/4 c of golden raisins when I added the wine, and let them plump as they simmered.  The tiny bursts of sweetness were amazing with the slightly bitter greens.  I never thought of using Parm with greens before, but it was wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe - it's going into my recipe box!",

I grew up with this stuff, love it, and was interested to try this variation of what I'm used to - the addition of white wine and lemon (the Parmesan being optional). I've always prepared this for the most part just as this submitter directs, occasionally adding bacon, and omitting the olive oil,  which I did this time. There's really no need to measure anything, just pop on some Dean Martin or Andrea Bocelli , have a glass of wine, and cook to your heart's content. This was delicious, just as Swiss Chard always is as far as I'm concerned....and I did love the addition of the white wine and lemon!",
