While I made this in a conventional oven, it could also be made in a slow cooker on the slow setting for 7 to 8 hours time). Hope it's a hit! There was enough marinade left that I threw it over some chicken tenders for tomorrow's dinner.",

I made the lamb in the slow cooker didn't have marjoram and used cooking wine instead of the lime juice I was fresh out of. I even liked it and had a 2nd piece after the reluctant taste test to see if it was done. Thank you All Recipes and Robertjm. I'd post a picture but it's probably all gone by now. Blessings.",

Sorry but a tender leg of lamb has a delicate flavour that shouldn't be compromised by to many other flavors and should never be placed in a crock pot.  I will however, try your marinade the next time I try a stewed lamb for rice.  The flavour of the spice should prove to be pleasant.",
