Many of the commentators didn't use buttermilk, I think the buttermilk is definitely great in this. The only change I made was to make my own cole slaw mix from fresh veggies - 1/2 a very small red cabbage, 1/2 a medium green cabbage, and 2 good sized carrots. I used an 1/8\" slice on the mandolin for the cabbage and the julienne setting for the carrots. My husband took a taste before dinner and asked me why we ever buy cole slaw from the store. We won't anymore.",
