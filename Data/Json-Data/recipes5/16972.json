I couldn't find coarse sugar but then I decided to roll them in Christmas green and red sugar since it is coarse. They were very festive-looking and the coarse sugar adds a little crunchiness that regular sugar doesn't. Everyone in the family loved them including my 2 1/2-year-old grandson. A new Christmas cookie addition to my recipe box.",
