There were leftovers for next day lunch. This recipe is a new staple for me. I made it again the following week replacing sausages with boneless chicken chunks. Roasted it until taters were soft and chicken tested as 165 degrees F.  (following USDA guidelines for doneness, easily googled)  I also added sweet potato chunks along with white taters. For faster meal, I plan to cut up the veggies the night before cooking, storing them in a gallon zip baggie. Dump onto tray with meat. Bake. Might even marinate the chicken version. Be inventive. This is versatile & adaptable.",
