The strange thing is I baked it for exactly 70 minutes checked it for doneness and then when I sliced into it you could see that it was slighty undercooked. Usually that would make for a moister cake...but not this time. The frosting/glaze was great though (if you like brown-sugar candy you'd like this!). It did not have the texture I was looking for either.",
