This was gourmet all the way, and easy to throw together using the pre-made CAULIPOWER\u00ae pizza crust. I was surprised at how crispy the crust was (being that it's made out of cauliflower). I wouldn't have known it was gluten-free either.  I threw the bacon on a sheet pan and cooked it in the oven while the oven was pre-heating. I also quartered the tomatoes to distribute them more evenly over the crust. I did top the pizza with the optional avocado, which I just diced. It was so good! I can't wait to make it again!",

The flavors are fabulous and CAULIPOWER crusts are simply amazing- I've never had a cauliflower-based crust that turned out so crispy and delicious-tasting.
