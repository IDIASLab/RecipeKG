The CAULIPOWER pizza crust was nice and crispy around the edges, with good texture in the middle.  The cauliflower taste was present, occasionally, but not in an overpowering way.  This was a kind of mash-up of a pizza and a tostada, and I liked the veggie content of the dish.  I have to say, though, it did not become my favorite way to prepare a pizza OR a tostada.  The word \"pizza\" conjures up a certain flavor profile for me, and it's not Tex-Mex.  I would like to try the CAULIPOWER pizza again, augmenting with more traditional pizza elements.",

The pizza does have a huge amount of toppings which slows the cooking of the crust underneath as well as making it hard to eat. I will try same amount of toppings split between two pizzas next time. I\u2019m serious, this pizza is really, really good!! CAULIPOWER pizza is fantastic and has great flavor! Knowing it is gluten-free, better-for-you, and delicious-tasting makes me feel like I found a genie to grant my wish for pizza to be diet friendly.",

We added some  cut up onion and bell pepper to the meat mix just to make sure we had veggies.   We also changed the sour cream out for hummus and loved the results!!  The caulipower was awesome and with the rest of the ingredients, it tasted so much better than I thought it would.  Even my kids enjoyed it so we will keep this and make it again.",
