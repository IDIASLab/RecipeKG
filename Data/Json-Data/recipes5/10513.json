They're overwhelming.\n\nThe second time I made it, I used 4 eggs instead of one (it makes the dressing fluffier - not hard as a brick).  Eliminated the salt, but I snipped about 2 T. of fresh parsley into the saute pan, along with 3 cloves of minced garlic.  And I dumped in several really good shakes of Morton's Nature's Seasoning.  While the veggies were sauteeing, I poured a box of organic chicken broth over the crushed crackers.  (I used an old Tupperware Fix 'n Mix bowl, as the volume is quite large.)  I waited until after I mixed the butter/veggies into the softened crackers before I added salt.  (I tasted the mixture first to determine if I needed additional salt.)  Then I mixed in the well-beaten eggs and poured it all into a buttered Corning Ware pan.  (Oh... I eliminated the milk/cream.  Kind of silly to add that, IMO.)\n\n\nI used 3 RIBS of celery - a stalk is the whole thing (you'd think that a CHEF would know that!).  I got rave reviews from the family - especially the picky grandchildren!  LOL\n\nMy recipe can be used with beef, pork, poultry, and fish because I don't use the sage, rosemary, and thyme.",
