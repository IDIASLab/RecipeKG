I added in Thai basil and lots of veggies such as carrots, onions, zucchini, water chestnuts and those mini-corn things.",

After cooking down, the texture was perfect, the ingredients didn't compete with each other, and you could taste layer after layer of flavors.  It takes a few seconds for the spiciness of the red curry paste to kick in, but when it does, it's just the right amount of \"heat.\"  Please don't skip the red curry paste, as it is sooooo important to this sauce.  I would give this 10 stars if possible, and I wouldn't change a thing.  Already been added to my Favorites folder.",
