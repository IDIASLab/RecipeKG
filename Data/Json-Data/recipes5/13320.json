I used homemade vanilla ice cream and just added the soaked raisins (I gave them a whirl in my food processor first) and only half the rum with the ice cream during the last five minutes in the churn. After 24 hours in the freezer I left it on the counter for about 5 minutes and it was super soft thanks to the alcohol. Thank you very much for the recipe.",
