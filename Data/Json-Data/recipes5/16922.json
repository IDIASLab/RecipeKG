It gives the meat so much tenderness, and I don't even brown the meat-  I found that I can reduce the fat content by omitting the shortening.\nWhen I make this in the crockpot (to serve TWO people) , I use 3/4 cups water, 1/4 cup ketchup, 1 tsp brown sugar 3/4 tsp paprika 3/4 tsp worchestershire sauce 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 dijon mustard, 2 garlic cloves minced, dash of cayenne pepper.  I mix the sauce together and pour over the beef stew meat and cook on high for about 6 hours.  Sometimes I will take some of the leftover sauce, and will whisk in some flour to make a gravy, and will serve the meat and gravy on top of boiled egg noodles or spaetzle.  This is a great dish for those nippy fall or winter evenings.",

I used tenderized extra lean stew meat in place of the lean beef chuck, and this cut the cook time by 1/2! I also cut back the salt to 1 tsp, which was plenty. I used 1/2 cup olive oil instead of shortening (personal pref) and did not need to add any water or flour! There was plenty of juice in the pan once all the other ingredients were added in. Wonderful aroma while cooking! Pretty presentation! Served with stiff mashed potatoes and salad! Thanks for a new family favorite!",

When I returned to the States Curryketchup wasn't readily available so I added about 1/2 tsp curry powder to it (that's a \"guesstimate\")- still good! Also added mushrooms.
