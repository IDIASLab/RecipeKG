I was a little concerned at leaving all the rest of the ingredients the same but it worked great! The only other adjustment I made was to toast the quinoa in a dry pan for about 10 minutes before cooking it. This step really brings out the nutty flavor and IMHO enhances the whole dish! I also make my own Greek salad dressing and in the future will try adding it in place of the dressing called for pretty much the same flavor profile anyway. This was a wonderful salad both my husband and I loved it will definitely be making this again!",

I also completely replaced the vinegar with fresh squeezed lemon juice...I juiced three small lemons and added the zest of one. I rarely write reviews but thought this one was definitely worth it! So good!!! (One last thing even if your quinoa is prewashed it's still good to rinse it thoroughly. I used red quinoa.)",
