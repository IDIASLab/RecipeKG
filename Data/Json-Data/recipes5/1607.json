We thought it was a little spicy but didn't feel the heat level was overpowering. It's a nice slow hit of heat with each bite. The only change I made to the recipe was that I blended a can of no salt added diced tomatoes with the chipotle peppers because I was out of crushed tomatoes. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written. While the chicken was cooking in the Instant Pot I made our sides of Mexican rice black beans and corn. Will definitely make this recipe again in the Instant Pot! Thanks for the recipe Soup Loving Nicole!",
