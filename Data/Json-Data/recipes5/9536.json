I use the microwave a glass measuring cup a handful of peeled Garlic cloves pick off the woody part cover with small microwave safe dish. 1-2 min on high power. Olive oil is good also with this or just plain. Stick with tooth pick and enjoy. On the grill. Put peeled Garlic cloves into a small foil baking pan drizzle with your favorite oil sprinkle some Italian seasoning (salt free). Wrap in foil set on grill near fire. Roast 5-10min. When adding meat to grill open foil and move to back of grill garlic wil have a smokey flavor. Spread onto bread or just pile ontop a fershly grilled steak slab of fish pork chicken.",
