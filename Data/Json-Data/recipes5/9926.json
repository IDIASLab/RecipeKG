When pouring the egg on top of the CAULIPOWER Margherita Pizza, it immediately poured off and got all over the place. I had to creatively adjust toppings to make an area for it to not pour over the sides. Next time I may precook the eggs and put on top to avoids spillage.  Once it was done it tasted really good and I enjoyed the cheesy flavor and crispy crust.",

I want to say it was easy to make, but you be the judge.  I mixed the egg whites with a fork to make sure they they flowed easily and I did use a ladle to slowly pour the egg white/ veggie mixture on the pizza  and that helped, I also laid down parchment paper to catch any runoff.  This would be a terrific brunch item as well!!!",

I used 2 large eggs instead of just egg whites, and the mixture stayed on pretty well with no real spills. The only thing is each time, I didn't need to cook it as long as stated--I cut a couple minutes off each step, otherwise it would have burned in my oven. My only real issues were with the CAULIPOWER pizza itself. When I first baked it, I put it directly on the rack like I always do with frozen pizzas (and the box directions said it could be done that way)--it left a big mess. I used a pan once I put the egg mixture on. Also, the crust was just okay; I'm sure if I had to be gluten free, I would get used to it. Overall, I don't think I would have liked the CAULIPOWER Margherita pizza by itself, but with this recipe, it helped it to taste good.",
