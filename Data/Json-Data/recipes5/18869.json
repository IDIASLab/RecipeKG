It doesn't need anywhere near that much butter though.  I melted a quarter cup of butter and put it in the halves of the squash and then added the rice/venison mixture.  After I took the squash out from under the broiler and cut the halves in half, butter just ran out.  I don't believe it was necessary to add that at all.\n\nSecondly, there is about twice as much venison/rice mixture than is needed for one acorn squash.  This isn't too much of a problem though as I am more than happy to just eat that on its own.\n\nSo four stars because of the unnecessary butter.  Otherwise I hope you enjoy the recipe.",

Here is what I did: Per other reviews I decided to cut out the butter entirely and double the rice which was a rice blend with lentils. I added finely chopped mushrooms (portobella) - good addition - and used fresh cranberries cooked down a bit. I would skip the sugar too next time because we also do not love sweet dishes for dinner like another reviewer. I made a double batch easily. Thanks for a new idea for venison!",

Even my 2 yr. old loved it. It was a bit too different for my meat-and-potatoes husband but he still ate it (I knew it wasn't to his taste when I cooked it but I can only do chili mac so many times). I think next time I'll use less sugar if I can't get fresh cranberries. The dried cranberries contain added sugar and I think that made the dish a bit too sweet. Also I used olive oil instead of butter - worked great & much healthier.",
