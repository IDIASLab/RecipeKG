Didn't use the sauce that was created because it was too onion-y. Next time I'll only use 1/2 an onion.\r\n\r\nAfter the ribs were done I transferred them to a cookie sheet and brushed them with BBQ sauce. I then baked them in a 400 degree oven for between 5 and 10 minutes while I set the table. We were able to pull the bones out (and they were clean), and then ate the meat with a fork. The meat was so tender we didn't need to use dental floss afterwards. It made a really good meal with coleslaw and corn bread.",

I used BBQ sauce instead of soy, and steak marinade instead of worcester because I didn't have any on hand. I cooked for 8 hours and took the advice of someone else by brushing on more BBQ sauce and cooking them for an extra 10 mins in a 400 degree oven. Perfection! Thanks for the recipe!",
