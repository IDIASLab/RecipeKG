It literally melted in my mouth. If you're concerned about too much salt, I would reduce the amount of chili paste and/or soy sauce. You MUST use light soy sauce, otherwise the regular soy sauce is too salty. Another way to modify the saltiness is to keep the salt content but increase the brown sugar content. At the end of roasting, the marinade was greatly reduced. You can put the marinade in a pan on the stovetop, whisk in some flour or corn starch, add hydrated mushrooms (I use shiitake but buttons or creminis would work too) to make a gravy. Absolutely delicious!!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely sensational.  This is the best pork dish I have ever tried. I made it almost exactly as written, although I marinated it for 20 hours.  Unlike some other writers,  I think that the sesame oil and Asian chili sauce are absolutely essential.  For the chili sauce, I used Guilin Chili Sauce by Lee Kum Lee, which you can buy at an Asian grocery.  It's as authentic as the sauces that I used while living in China.  I am puzzled, however, over the 25-30 minute cooking time for a 2lb. pork roast.  After 30 minutes, the pork was only at 120 degrees.  Even at the recommended 450, it took far longer to get it close to 160.  I wanted it barely done, because I dislike well done pork; 50 minutes did the job.  I covered the pork for the first 15-20 minutes and left it uncovered for the remainder of the time.;  Next time, I'll add grated ginger, although it was delicious without it.  Another nice addition is a sauce that in Japan is known simply as \"Sauce.\"  The closest that I have found here is Bull-Dog Vegetable and Fruit Sauce (semi-sweet), also available at Asian grocery stores.  It's a good Worcestershire sauce substitute (I used some of this sauce in place of part of the Worcestershire).",

I didn't want to buy Chili Paste since I don't like spicy and wasn't sure how spicy it would be so I used some Chili Powder instead about 1 teaspoon. I also started late on marinating so it marinated for 6 hours and I used both tenderloins and marinated in a resealable bag. It was plenty of marinade. I did use the leftover marinade, heated it up on the stove and added about a 1/2 T cornstarch to thicken it. I noticed a few reviews mentioned how the marinade burned on the foiled pan, I don't know if you poured all the marinade onto the pork on the pan, I just took the pork out and put on a lined foiled pan sprayed with cooking spray. This worked out fine, the pork didn't stick and the cleanup was easy since I tossed the foil.",
