I tried it once as written, but to make it a 5, I recommend a little tweaking that I tried the second time:  I included the (chopped) mushroom stems in the stuffing, and I added a little sherry, Worcestershire sauce, and fresh horse radish, and I used fresh dill, rather than dried.  I also used a combination of baby Portabella and button mushrooms. The choice of mushrooms had little effect on the end result, but I have a slight preference for the Portabella flavor and texture.  With those minor modifications, this is my favorite stuffed mushroom recipe ever.",
