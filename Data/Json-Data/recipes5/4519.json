Next time I would omit the broth and cook the orzo in unsalted water. With all the other great flavors I don't think the broth would be missed. I would also omit the butter and just rinse the pasta to eliminate any sticking. I used fresh basil and thyme and added grape tomatoes to cut the salt taste, it was a nice addition. Did a dry toasting on the nuts and drizzled the oil in the salad. Diced chicken would go very well in this salad. Thank you for the post.",

Another reviewer suggested dry roasting the pine nuts...next time I'll do that as well...to brown them up a little better and prevent my garlic from browning. I didn't have kalamata olives so I used black olives and I did add chopped artichoke hearts and grape tomatoes for color. BUT this recipe on it's own deserves 5 stars. Thank you for the recipe:)",
