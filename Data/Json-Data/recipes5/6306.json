Here as well \u2013 but for us the amount of bacon called for would have been a case of bacon overkill.  Half the amount was perfect \u2013 its presence was known, but it served as an enhancement, not a main ingredient that would dominate.  Too much of a good thing\u2026 is not good.  One other thing \u2013 you know how it is when people come over, you\u2019re in the kitchen cooking and you\u2019re talking and trying to follow a recipe at the same time \u2013 and if you notice you messed up at all it isn\u2019t until after the fact and it\u2019s too late.  Well, it was because of gabbing in the kitchen that I forgot the lemon juice.  And I think the omission made this so much better.  The bottom line?  This was just excellent, a hit at the dinner table.  But next time I make it I will do it the same way, with half the bacon, no lemon juice (and a good dab of butter).",

I decreased the bacon to 4 strips and doubled the spinach as per other reviewers but I think I would triple or even quadruple the spinach next time as it cooks down to almost nothing. I also doubled the garlic (certified garlic lover here). I didn't think I'd enjoy the lemon flavor but thought I'd try it and I'm so glad I did... it was delicious. Mmm... such a lovely flavourful pasta dish!! (PS: I forgot to cut the bacon before frying it so I took a pair of scissors and cut it into half-inch or so pieces afterwards. It was very easy to cut this way:)",

I am a fitness geek so I will also tweak cooking according to my caloric intake and health preferences. All the bacon and bacon grease was a bit rough for me. I made this as a side dish to a piece of salmon so the lemon was pleasant. Thank you for sharing your recipe. It will be a good addition to my rotation.",
