After cooking the marinade I placed the pork chops in a baking dish and completely soaked them with the soy mixture then baked them 45 minutes in the soy mixture bath. For the last 15 minutes I put the pork chops on a rack and baked with the ketchup/cocktail sauce. The chops melted in our mouths and were delicious!! My family thought the cocktail sauce wasn't the best complement to the pork - so I might try it with the original chili sauce next time.",
