And of course I added lots of fruit, since they were calling out my name in the produce section. I did see these beautiful fruit tarts in NYC visiting that had this wonderful beautiful glossy glaze that caught my attention. And so I duplicated, something that worked for this. 4 tbsp white sugar, 2 tsp lemon juice, 2 tsp cornstarch, 4 tbsp water, 1 small envelope knox unflavored gelatin. Boil all ingredients except the Knox's until sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and stir in the Knox until gelatin is dissolved, cool slightly(it will thicken) with a pastry brush, gently brush over the top of fruit evenly, until all is covered....It worked like a charm on my fruited sponge cake tart...Will make again but add a cream cheese mixture next time instead of whipped topping. And I did have some left over glaze and I mixed it with remaining fruit I had sliced up as well that didn't get to make it on to the tart.",
