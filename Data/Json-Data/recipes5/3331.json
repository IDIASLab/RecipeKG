I think prosciutto would be nice instead of the bacon when you don't feel like frying. In my small town I had trouble finding poppy seed dressing. I eventually found one by Renee's which was good. The only other offering was Kraft Creamy Poppyseed which looked a bit too creamy for this. I'd be interested to know what other people used. Great recipe Donna!",
