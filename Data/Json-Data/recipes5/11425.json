Because I don't own an oven-ready skillet, I modified recipe instructions to prepare this dish via stovetop method---and it still turned out fantastic.  I browned my chicken using the bacon fat grease before discarding all but a tablespoon of it, which lent a smoky flavor to the sauce, complimenting the mushrooms and fresh green onions.  Next time, I will be looking at thickening this marvelous sauce .  My way of making this dish may have removed the Keto diet benefits--but it sure was a tasty dish my family loved.",
