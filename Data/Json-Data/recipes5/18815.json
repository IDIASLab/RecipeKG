It is also made with whole grains, which contribute for a good health. It supplies a lot of energy and the bananas give an extra dose of potassium. That is why this pie is consumed by athletes and people who practice sports in general. Besides, it is simply delicious!",

Everyone loved it and were sorry they were too full to eat more! (10 inch spring form pan fits it all well.)",

Maybe it was supposed to be that way I don't know. But I was thinking it was going to be more like an apple crisp type topping so I was a little disappointed. I needed more bananas than called for but the ones I used were a little on the small side. The taste of everything else was great and I would've rated it higher if it weren't for the topping being so dry. Thanks for a good recipe.

Second the pie looks NOTHING like the picture. The syrup is on bottom. Clearly the picture shown has syrup or some bananas on top. Third a normal or even deep pie dish is too small unless you halve the dry ingredients. If you use more butter/margarine and keep the dry ingredients the same be sure to use a 9x13 type baking dish. Fourth we used 10 bananas and followed the recipe exactly. It's too dry. We used a large 2 qt baking dish which still wasn't big enough. Solution? Add milk and treat is like a sweet banana porridge/oatmeal. It's got potential but needs tweaking. Also recommend doubling the syrup amount.",
