The ingredients only made one pie although the crust was really full. I made two pies. In one I put one and a quarter tablespoons of cinnamon and the other I put a little more than half a tablespoon. I think both pies still had too much cinnamon. I did like the flavor of the brandy coming through. I will use this recipe again but I will definitely use less cinnamon.",

For this recipe I also used: 1 Cup of brown sugar 2/3 Cup of milk (minus a table spoon or two of milk). Since I did not have Brandy I used some raspberry Chambord Liquor I had in the house and this recipe came out so wonderfully delicious. I do not think I will ever make pumpkin pie without a little bit of spirits ever again! It added a little bit of extra smooth flavor to the pie heavenly!",
