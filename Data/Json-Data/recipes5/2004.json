No green onion, so I yellow, and all I had was Dijon mustard and used that. I diced the onion, cooked ham, and also 3 cloves of garlic minced (I LOVE garlic) and  added to a frying pan with with olive oil until the onion was tender.. This gets any water in the ham and onion out. No half and half so I used 3/4 cup light cream and 1/2 cup heavy cream and no Swiss so I substituted shredded sharp Cheddar and Parmesan. I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a dash of Cayenne pepper. I also used a store bought 9\" pie shell. Hmmm... so rich and creamy and the mustard adds a unique zing to it.",

I have had better quiche less time consuming and less costly recipes. Also the recipe should say use a deep dish or wide crust. I had a semi deep dish crust I made homemade. The filling still seemed to spill over some as it baked. I am glad I ended up placing the pie plate over a foiled lined rimmed baking sheet. I would have had one messy oven otherwise. Taste wise it wasn't bad just a little oniony. Not a repeat dish but nice to try something I hadn't eaten in years.",
