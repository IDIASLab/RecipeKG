It did take a while to chop all the vegetables I added green pepper because the store was out of red and I forgot to add the tomato. Which was perfect because the mom does like them at all. I refrigerated this overnight and added a little extra italian dressing 1/2 hour before serving. Doubling doesn't really require 2 full bottles of dressing. Save it to zest it up right before serving. I'm making it again this weekend and I'm adding the red pepper and tomato.",
