My husband is on a low-carb diet and this was perfect for him. I did add one more egg too as a binder. The sauce I made to go with it was 1 tablespoon dijon mustard mixed with 2 tablespoons of mayo. This is a great dipping sauce for chicken cordon bleu as well. He loved it and so did I and I'm not a fish lover. Wow! will definitely make this one again. Also baked it as one of the reviews suggested too! 375 for 20 min.",

Reserve a bit of juice incase your pattys are too dry. I would add a few tablespoons of the salmon juice and extra bread crumbs if it needs more. This gave me about 8 salmon cakes. Also added one extra egg. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly. My kids LOVED these and I'm going to choose this recipe over an old favorite recipe from now on. I think the chopped onion is great in it. (was a bit curious how that would turn out)  I wouldnt use the onion powder over it personally.",

I used 12 oz leftover grilled sockeye salmon instead of canned and doubled the amount of hot pepper sauce as we like things a little more flavorful (it definitely was not spicy). I only used half the recommended amount of butter and olive oil, and that was still more than enough. I served the salmon cakes with a dollop of sour cream horseradish on the side (1T prepared horseradish stirred into 3/8 cup lite sour cream) and it was fantastic. This is what I'm doing with leftover salmon from here on out!",
