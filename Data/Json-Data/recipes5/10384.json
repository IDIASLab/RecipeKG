I changed a couple of things but basically stuck to the plan. I did not use the the Dijon or parsley not needed. I did it the same except instead of cooking on the stove for 25 mins I baked it in a covered enameled cast iron Dutch oven. I saute'd the sausages then onions & I added a shallot with the garlic saute. Layered it with sausages & potatoes on bottom then cabbage on top. Baked for about 45 mins covered at 375. I thickened it before serving with whole grain organic baby rice cereal while on stove. No gluten!",

I followed this recipe to the letter, and what I ended up with tasted like meat and potatoes boiled with cabbage and water. I expected some apple flavor using the apple chicken sausage and cooking it in apple juice. The apple flavor was nonexistent, and the sausage was tough (the texture really changed), burst open (not good for presentation), and I did simmer on a low temperature. It was so bland that near the end I added some caraway seeds, more salt and pepper, and we actually used cider vinegar at the table to add some flavor. If I were to make this again, I would use more onion, and add fresh apples to the cabbage.  Since the sausages picked up no flavor from the apple juice and were totally cooked anyway, I'd most likely not simmer them with the cabbage and just add in toward the end to reheat (they looked great after browning). Sorry Chef John, this is just my opinion, but I did not consider this one of your best efforts. Doubtful I'll make again, too many tweaks to make this work for us.",

It was easy to cut shreds of cabbage from the head and it tasted great much better than a similar recipe using sauerkraut. After reading other reviews it seems some have misread the recipe using apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider. Yikes no wonder they did not like the strong vinegar taste. There is no vinegar called for in this recipe. I recommend they try it again but with apple cider this time and believe they will really enjoy it!",

The sausage tasted fine and the cabbage cooked in apple juice was different. If you know someone who doesn't like cabbage they might be OK with this because it really doesn't have a cabbage flavor just a sweet flavor yet not apple-y. However the Yukon Golds cooked in apple juice didn't make the cut. I want potatoes to taste like potatoes and I found the sweet flavor imparted by the apple juice to be unsettling. I probably won't make this recipe again. This review isn't a \"Dear John\" letter but it isn't a love letter either.",
