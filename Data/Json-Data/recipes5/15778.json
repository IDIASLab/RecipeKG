My mind couldn't quite process the upside down (or reversed) baking of this casserole but it was good. I totally plan to try again with the following changes. 1) place beef on bottom per normal. 2) in place of your typical green beans (as the 2nd \"layer\" I will try...maybe a can of chili beans or black beans...we'll see what's in my pantry. 3) pour half the sauce over the meat/beans layer tots and pour remaining sauce over all. Bake for the normal hour or so as I am used to but will still achieve the Mexican twist goal. Fun and worth a try. Thank you for the great idea.",

Other than that, the one major change I made was to flip this casserole upside down from it's instructions.  I have OCD...seriously...and my mind could not deal with the tots being on the bottom.  The concept literally drove me insane (anyone with OCD will understand) and I couldn't build the casserole the way it was instructed.  So I placed the hamburger/tomato soup/taco seasoning mix with the corn I added on the bottom, topped it with 3/4 of the nacho cheese soup mixture, then the tater tots which I crisped beforehand, then drizzled those with the final 1/4 nacho cheese soup mix.  Baked for 15 - 20 minutes, then topped with the shredded cheese and diced green onion. Placed back in the oven another 5-10 minutes until cheese was melted and golden brown.  This was DELICIOUS.  Rave reviews from hubby and one that will definitely go into rotation.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!",
