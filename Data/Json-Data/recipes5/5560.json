The ingredients are pretty much the same as I typically use and I never use mayo. I found the breadcrumbs overpowered the salmon flavor and I use a very high quality canned salmon. I would use fewer breadcrumbs just enough to hold the patties together. I mixed up the sour cream-dill sauce tasted it and thought it was fairly bland so I added a little seasoned salt and some lemon zest. Don't really mean to knock this recipe because we did enjoy it but honestly didn't find it to be anything out of the ordinary pretty much the same as I've been making for years.",

I used Ener-G Egg Replacer in lieu of the whole egg (I had it on hand but egg whites would work too) reduced the breadcrumbs by a tad and used non-fat Greek yogurt instead of low-fat sour cream. I also added more dill and a bit of lemon zest. With or without the tweaks the recipe is solid! I have to add one other tip that I didn't use for this particular recipe but that I often use for my salmon patties: the magic of the waffle iron! We love love love how crispy the waffle iron makes the patties and just use a little olive oil spray to keep them from sticking. Try it! I think you'll be surprised!",
