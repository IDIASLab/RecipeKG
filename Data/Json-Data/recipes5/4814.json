The one and only creator of this dish, Francesca herself, has made it for me 3 times. She is from Lockport, IL. She created this dish and won 1st place in a local competition with this recipe. She is glad that people are enjoying her recipe.\r\n\r\n***\r\nHi this is Francesca.  I am glad you liked the recipe.  Here are some hints:  I usually serve it with angel hair pasta and steamed brocolli coated in olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper.  To make it less fattening, you could substitute olive oil for half of the amount of butter in the Shrimp recipe.   It does not change the flavor.  You could also add, some cherry tomato cut in half to add more color.  You could serve it with some tabasco sauce.  Also serve with a glass of medium bodied wine to enhance the flavor of the dish.  I would just like to add, that I have always wanted this to become a dish that is served at weddings, for engagement parties as well as the birth of children.  In any event, it is a celebratory dish.  God Bless All, and thank you for posting my recipe.",

Everyone had seconds and I wish there was a little more so I'll use 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp next time.  We served with buttered vermicelli pasta.  We also sprinkled more parmesan over our dish.  I followed one suggestion to use half butter half olive oil.  My 2 daughters said it's better than the pasta dishes they tried at the Cheesecake Factory restaurant. Delicious, give it a try.",

This dish was fantastic and super quick and easy yet tasted elegant like from a four start restaurant, I whipped this together in literally minutes.  My 14 year old said it was the best thing she's ever eaten, and my nine yeal old who only eats chicken fingers said it looked good, \"even to her!!\". I served it along side yellow rice.  The only thing I might do next time is add an 1/8 of a cup of dry white wine to make a little bit of a sauce but that's a prefernce., the recipe was outstanding as is., thanks for sharing!!",
