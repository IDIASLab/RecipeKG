When I finished mixing it all up it didn't taste quite right. I realized it was missing a salty flavor form the prebuterd and salted microwave popcorn. Solution salt your caramel corn after you mix it up. Go easy and salt to taste. Then it is great. A little sweet and salty. Yum",

I added the caramel to small amounts of the popcorn until it was as gooey as we like it. I do not have a candy thermometer, so I tested it by putting the caramel in cold water. Cooking it as long as it says was too long. It got hard too fast and that made it very chewy. The second time I cooked it til it made a very soft ball. This was much better. This does make a very large batch and is hard to eat the second day. Unless you are making this for a large crowd, half the recipe. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. Yum!",

I really do not like crunchy caramel corn.  It reminds me of the boxed stuff.  No thanks!  This recipe was super easy and I was 100% pleased with the result.  Better yet, I don't have to bake it!  I did add some peanuts, though.  When this caramel corn cooled down, I put it in small zipper bags and stuck them in the freezer.  I can grab one for a snack, but I usually share it with the entire family.  We all love it!!",
