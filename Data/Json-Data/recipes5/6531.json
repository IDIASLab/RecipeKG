First, I have to double it to feed our large family. I end up using 2-3 cans of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh. I leave out the peas, and use fresh mushrooms finely chopped. I end up only using 4 peppers instead of the six I'd be using with the doubled recipe, and we use mushroom soy sauce instead of regular. I've tried the store bought lemon juice in it before, but the fresh squeezed is the best. I also take chicken thighs or chicken quarters, bone in and skin on, and toss them in the bottom of the slow cooker before putting the stuff on top of them. Later, after it's cooked for a while, I pry the bones and skin out and shred the chicken. I also add a lot more garlic than it calls for because of our love of garlic. It's very good, and I will continue to make this as long as my family requests it.",

I knew going in that this recipe was going to be bad looking at the ingredients, but once again, against my better judgement, I followed it exactly. We are currently ordering pizza and thankfully it's garbage night so this doesn't have to sit around my home. The dogs wouldn't even eat it. The (broth? juice?) tasted like poorly made vegetable soup.\n\nAdvice: Add seasonings. Oregano, basil, thyme, a pack of Saz\u00f3n, something. If you're going Asian, add ginger, honey, cumin, turmeric, curry powder, just something more than just a teaspoon of salt and pepper \"to taste\" for a six serving size meal. I would also recommend doing the lower temp/longer cooking time as the 3 hours didn't cook the potatoes fully and after 4 hours the chicken was super dry.",
