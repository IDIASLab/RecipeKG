When I made it, I used a more buttery cracker like the tollhouse ones and it came out superb.  One mistake I made the first time I made this-- I didn't mix the butter and brown sugar enough and ended up with a buttery/sugary mess that was more separated-- the sugar stayed in the middle and the butter ran along the outer edges of the pan-- still tasted good but wasn't as presentable-- so make sure you mix it until the sugar has completely dissolved.  Also... i brought this to a Christmas party and did it in thirds... One third had peanuts on top, one third had walnuts and one third had mini M&Ms... All three combinations were wonderful!  ENJOY!",

When you cook the brown sugar and butter it is watery - as it heats to the proper temperature it comes together and when you can wipe your spatula across the bottom as you stir, it will separate so that you can see the bottom of the pan.  It is hard to describe in typing but once you see it, you will get what I am trying to convey :)",
