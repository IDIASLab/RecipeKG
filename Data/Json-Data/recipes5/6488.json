I forgot to plan ahead, so I ended up boiling the tofu instead of freezing. The recipe notes didn't say for how long, so I went with 15 mins at a light simmer. I'd recommend marinating the tofu in the artichoke/caper liquid ahead of time for more flavor. Also, once I added the tofu back in the pan, the breading began falling off, so next time I'll just set the tofu aside, make the sauce, then pour the sauce over top of the tofu.   The sauce also didn't take 10 mins to thicken/reduce down, more like 3-4. I'll be making this again!",
