First of all I questioned why this is considered an Instant Pot recipe. You spend 25 minutes steaming the veggies and melting the sauce mixture when both can be done in the microwave in less than 5 minutes. Then just to turn around and bake it in the oven for 20 minutes. Even though this did not add up to me I proceeded and made the recipe exactly as written. The veggies ended up so overdone that the cauliflower completely disintegrated. The finished dish was like eating really soupy mashed potatoes. I definitely think using fresh broccoli and cauliflower would have remedied the texture and consistency but I won't be making this again to find out.",
