I omitted the sage altogether since I didn't have any and tossed in a pinch of poultry seasoning (negligible amount actually) as I know sage is one of the ingredients. Since I didn't feel like grating the wedge of parmesan cheese I opted to throw in some feta cheese as a substitution. Besides if it's this fantastic with the feta I KNOW it would be awesome with the parm. But you know what ingredient really makes this recipe? The shallots! They create such a wonderful contrast of flavors. Since the recipe calls for them to be browned you get little tiny flecks of brown throughout the sweet potato mixture. Exquisite! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!",
