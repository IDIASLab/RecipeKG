I only used one bag of pre-washed spinach and used 5 tsp of a garlic ginger paste that I keep in the fridge. I chopped the chicken and ended up with about 2 cups which I added to the sauce and cooked on low pressure for 5 min. The chicken fell apart and blended well. After adding the spinach I cooked it on low pressure for 8 min. Lastly I only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne since I was feeding toddlers. Really really good over basmati rice. Thank you!",

I had read reviews saying that it was a bit bland, which was hard to imagine, given all the spices the recipe calls for!  Nevertheless, it was a bit bland.  It was also very dry--not creamy like it is in restaurants.  Therefore, I recommend that you double the milk and (at least) triple the amount of butter called for.  I would also at a TBS of the Garam Masala (not a tsp.) and a TBS of salt (not a tsp.).  You may need to add even more salt to taste.",
