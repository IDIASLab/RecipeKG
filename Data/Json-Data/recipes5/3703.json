I needed to make it for a party that I was attending and used it with Kalua Pig from this site and steamed rice. It was delicious. I made it exactly as written. We did have some party goers that I was not familiar with their taste buds so was unsure if the spice/heat was going to be too much or not enough. For this crowd it was perfect. Next time I make it for us I will increase the pepper flakes as I like spice. Otherwise just wonderful. Thanks for submitting.",
