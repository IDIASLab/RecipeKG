Delicious with butter of course! I used one cup fresh mango because I already had some on hand. For half the batch I tossed in 1/4 cup of cranberries and topped with sliced almonds. I loved the addition of almonds but the cranberries made the flavors too confusing. I will be making this easy recipe again. Next time I will replace the couscous with quinoa so they'll be gluten free!",

These are moist and delicious. Not too sweet but sweet enough to eat on their own. They'd be great with butter or jam. I used about 3/4 cup of dried mangoes since I wanted to use all I had followed the recipe completely other than that. Next time I'll take the other reviewer's advice and use quinoa in place of the couscous for gluten free and a little extra protein. Thanks!",

I used half apple butter/half oil and added a tsp of cinnamon. Also used chopped fresh pear because I was out of dried mangoes. The exture is dense moist and anything but \"gritty\". This bread made great French toast the next day. I'll probably add some nuts next time. Thanks Rachel D!",
