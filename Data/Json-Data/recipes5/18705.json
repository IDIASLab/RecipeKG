The flavors simply did not blend well together at all. This may have tasted better with less Kahlua used as an accent flavor to the sweet potatoes but the recipe as written creates a clash of flavors each attempting to claim the dish. If making this recipe I would suggest adding the Kahlua in small doses a little at a time until a nice flavor has been reached. This was the only dish that everyone turned down when it was time to pack left-overs and send them home with my guests. Sorry......but this recipe should state to add the Kahlua until the desired taste is achieved.",

I used a yellowish sweet potato as opposed to a yam. I simmered the sauce a little after adding the kahlua to cook off some of the alcohol. The kahlua added a great unexpected flavor. Sweet potatoes are so nutritious you should eat them often not just for Thanksgiving. And use this recipe!",
