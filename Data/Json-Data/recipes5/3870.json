I like my mother's salmon patties but these are 100 times better.  There are four things we found though - 1. If you don't have italian seasoned bread crumbs, just use plain and add a little italian seasoning - 2. Sour Cream works in the sauce if you don't have Mayo - 3. You don't need very much of the sauce or it ends up overpowering the burger, which I didn't like - and 4. Cucumbers taste really good on these  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It was an instant favorite.  :D",

I served them as salmon patties, not on buns, with the mayo sauce on the side.  They were delicious!  I especially liked the sauce.
