Made a few modifications: used the 14 oz can of pink salmon 1/2 a small tub of good smoked salmon cream cheese a few drops liquid smoke 1 tbsp horseradish lemon juice and 3 finely chopped green onions. Also added some dried dill a few shakes worchestershire sauce and a few shakes tabasco. Added a tiny amount of salt. The key is letting it sit in the fridge for at least a couple hours to let the flavors marry a bit. Served on Wasa rye crispbread. I will be making this for all my get-together from now on!:)",
