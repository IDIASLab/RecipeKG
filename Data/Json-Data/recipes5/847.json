There just wasn't enough liquid once you drain off all the beans. I ended up using the full bigger size can of tomato sauce and while some like a fork stand in their chili I grew up with it being more soupy. I probably added more water than most would prefer but even then it didn't lack in flavor. This was good on its own and didn't even need rice. Great flavor but it just needs more liquid to get everything incorporated.",
