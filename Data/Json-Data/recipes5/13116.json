Wanted to make sure the potatoes weren't soggy, so I put those in the bottom of the pan (with some season salt and pepper) in the oven while I got everything else ready.  Meanwhile I beat the eggs and chopped the ham, gathered other ingredients.  Sprinkled ham, poured SIX beaten eggs (per many reviews), the seasonings, and sprinkled with cheese.  I baked maybe 30 minutes, then moved closer to heat to brown for about 5 minutes.  ~~~Husband said he could have eaten all of it.  This would be good with different meats or cheeses.  I think I'd like to try with saut\u00e9ed bell peppers and onions.  Husband rated 5 stars.  I will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!",
