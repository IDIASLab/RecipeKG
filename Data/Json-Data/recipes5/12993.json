Serve with toast, chips or toasted tortillas. Diced chicken breast may be used in place of canned chicken, and black olives may be added. I've also used this as a casserole by mixing in cooked noodles.",

Also be sure to drain the tomatoes well using a strainer b/c my \"dip\" was really runny. This is okay but IF I make this again I will boil 2 chicken breasts shred it drain the tomtatoes REALLY well mix and bake in the oven until the cheese has melted stirring occassionally. This recipe has hope but it just needs some tweeking. I may try this again and see if there is texture and taste improvement.",
