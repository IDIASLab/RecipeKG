                "reviewBody": "Lot of work here before you even turn on the slow cooker.  First, 4 tsp of salt plus 1 cup of olives (with lots of sodium) made this WAY too salty for us.  And I hate that because I have a ton of leftover sauce going into the freezer.  I'd recommend starting with 1 tsp salt and then adding to suit your taste because once it's in there, you can't take it out.  After 7 hours cooking, the consistency was too soupy to serve over pasta, so I added one 6-oz can of tomato paste which brought it to the right consistency.  I wouldn't bother with the 1/2 tsp cumin because it's just lost in a pot of sauce this large, and I wouldn't saute the parsley, just stir it into the sauce.  The recipe doesn't specify whether or not the cans of stewed tomatoes should be drained; I didn't drain them.  FYI, I used a 4-quart cooker, which was filled right up to the top.  Only change I made to this recipe was adding one teaspoon fennel seed, which I always add to spaghetti sauce.  We liked the flavor, and I'm giving 4 stars based on less salt and adding tomato paste.",
