This is so easy that it makes no sense to me to use frozen lemonade concentrate which is loaded with sugar. One lemon gives you 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice which yields two servings. I always put my lemons in the microwave and heat on high for 20 seconds which maximizes the juice. I used only 1 Tbsp of Truvia and it was plenty sweet for us. I recently starting cooking with Truvia and I really like the fact that you get no aftertaste as you do with some other artificial sweeteners.",

(I did not have any Truvia because I found it not to be sweet enough when using it previously so I substituted Stevia in the Raw.) When making a second pitcher I took the zest off one lemon and added it to some stevia to enhance the flavor. Then I used a full cup of the lemon-infused stevia dissolving it in a cup of warm water before adding the lemon juice and cold water. First taste is more to our liking.",
