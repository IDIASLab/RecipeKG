I didn't read through all the reviews, but from most of them I gathered modifications, which added up to a winning recipe!\n- I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar.\n- I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup/brown sugar mix.\n- I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1 egg.\n- I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture.  Plus, I love celery, so I chopped up some of that and added it in.\nFinally, I used a cup of season bread crumbs instead of the crackers.\n\nBeing impatient and hungry, I followed another user's idea and made mini-loves in my muffin pan.  I put the ketchup/brown sugar sauce on bottom, cooked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, then spooned the rest of the sauce on top and cooked another 15. This was so delicious, I can't wait to make it again - this time in actual loaf form.  Yum yum!",

When I sliced the meatloaf, the brown sugar/ketchup mixture remained in the bottom of the pan, so I tried to invert the pan so that the mixture would drain into and flavor the meatloaf.  This was a disaster - the sauce splattered all over the kitchen.  I just don't see the point of having the brown sugar/ketchup in the bottom of the pan as it didn't flavor the meat much.  It should be on top.",
