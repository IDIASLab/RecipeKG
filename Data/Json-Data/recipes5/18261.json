The orange brandy sauce really makes it;  I did not have regular brandy, but I did have a bottle of Cointreau (orange brandy) which was wonderful because it only added to the orange flavor.  I also used fresh o.j. right out of the fridge, since I never keep the concentrated stuff around.  Delicious recipe!",
