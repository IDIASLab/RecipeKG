As he was devouring his second serving he declared it was delicious. I will be preparing this dish many times. The leftovers was equally delicious.",

Although the fennel is in season it did take a trip to two stores to find it, and was worth every minute of the effort.  This is the first time I used fresh fennel which looks a little like celery but with wispy ends on the stalk instead of leaves (simply chop it like you would celery).  The fennel added a nice delicate flavor to the beef and mushrooms that really made the meal memorable.  Thanks for the great Recipe Hunt's, we will definitely be making this again!",

Also could not find the Hunt's Recipe Squeezable Paste at my local grocery store so just used a can of tomatoe paste. It worked out all right. But a night or two later after I put the leftovers in a corning wear dish and reheated it in the mike it tasted so much better as leftovers usually do. I guess it just needed to soak thru more. So right off the stove allright leftovers even better.",
