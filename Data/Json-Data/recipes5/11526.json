Try to buy the commercial bagged watercress that already has been cleaned to speed things along, or you may substitute other mixed salad greens. (I like to make sure there are some bitter ones, such as radicchio and arugula, along with milder greens, such as butter lettuce or baby spinach.) Also, because this is such a simple salad, all the ingredients should be top-quality. So spring for the best smoked salmon you can find.",

In addition to the lettuce and smoked salmon I threw in pinenuts grape tomatoes cut in half and one avocado cubed. The creamy avocado and fresh smoked salmon were fabulous together.

I'm watching calories so I also cut the olive oil back to a few tablespoons and added an equal amount of water. I read the comments about adding something sweet so used Honey Dijon mustard. But the lemon/vinegar goes very well with the peppery bite of the watercress. Have most of a smoked filet flaked in a bag and with the dressing pre made this will be a super quick salad to whip up the next few days. I smoke salmon pretty frequently and this will be a regular rotation for the cold leftovers. Thanks.",
