Even my husband who loves that nasty canned junk loved this. AWESOME. NOTE: If you don't like all that ketchup, think about cutting the ketchup in half and using either chili sauce or BBQ sauce.",

Now, I\u2019m thinking that canned versions simply can\u2019t compete with the real thing, plus \u2026 well, why waste money at the market when this dish is quick, easy & inexpensive? I recently made it for the 5th time and loved seeing my husband & guests return for more.  When salsa hasn\u2019t been onhand, Pico De Gallo (for which there are several excellent recipes at this site) has worked great, and on one occasion I used Rotel tomatoes (the type with lime juice & cilantro)\u2014also excellent. I guess there\u2019s no way to ruin this recipe, for which I\u2019m *very* grateful to LV & her mom-in-law.  (Thanks, as well, to photographer Avon Lady, whose shot portrays the dish 100% accurately\u2014thick, non-greasy & delightful on big fluffy buns which, like another reviewer, I serve lightly toasted.)

I didn't measure the ketchup or salsa and think I might have used a bit less than the recipe states but I definitely got all the flavor. I also used white wine vinegar instead of plain vinegar. I added some red pepper flakes to mine for a bit of added top heat. I wasn't looking for a Southwest flavor in these and fortunately the salsa just adds the tomato and onion flavor. Thank you for a great recipe!",

I don't really like dijon mustard but I wanted to be true to the recipe so I added it. You can't detect it specifically and it probably did add to the overall taste so I am glad I put it in. I did add onion powder and garlic powder but it probably didn't need it so don't sweat it if you don't have any. Make it as written and enjoy! UPDATE: I now have custody of my 6 and 7 year old granddaughters. I was afraid these might be too spicy or tangy for them. I don't find them too spicy or tangy but I fixed them without the hot pepper and held my breath and my girls LOVED them! Fix them serve them enjoy them. This recipe is a winner.",
