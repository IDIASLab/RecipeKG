In the heat of summer I browned the ribs over charcoal getting a good carmelization losing some of the fat and adding a subtle smokey flavor. Since the chef advises tasting and adjusting flavors the rest of the recipe is right on target. Served with an aromatic basmati rice cooked with cardamom pods and whole cloves this was a hit with my wife.",

I had about 3 lbs of boneless short ribs and used Vindaloo curry powder instead of the red curry paste and this was wonderful! The only thing I may do differently next time is double the amount of sauce. I also didn't think to review the video once again before making this dish and did not cover the Dutch oven when it went into the oven (the printed recipe did not specify this detail) and my cauliflower took 15 minutes on the stovetop instead of the 5 mentioned in the recipe. I almost skipped the star anise because it smelled like liquorice but I am so glad I stuck with the recipe as written. This is definitely a keeper and will be made often in our home.
