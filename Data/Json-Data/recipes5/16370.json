When I got the the portion for the flour I couldn't believe that it took only 3/4 cup. I looked at other banana bread recipes and decided that it must take 1-3/4 Cup of flour so I did this. I also changed the salt amount from 1 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon otherwise it would be too salt. It turned out delicious!!!!",

They really give otherwise boring banana bread an extra kick. But the taste and texture are much less intense than the classic fruitcake. The first batch I rum-soaked just the raisins. The second batch (I made a double batch the second time) I soaked the raisins and walnuts. What a super taste! The third time I used cherry-flavored Craisins instead of raisins. The sky is the limit on flavor variations. Oh I almost forgot to mention that this recipe can fill 4 small aluminum loaf tins. They bake in 30 minutes at 350. For the double batch I had to go 40 minutes. These tins fit perfectly in Christmas decorated treat bags - for teachers' gifts.",
