I did use homemade taco seasoning/chili seasoning. I did not add the additional salt as condensed soup can be quite salty on it's own. My family enjoyed this casserole all of the boys asked for seconds. I'd make this again.",

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the heat was too much for my 2 younger kids. My older kids and husband were fine. The sour cream helped cut the heat some. I will make again, however I will use half of the suggested seasoning.\nThanks for sharing this delicious easy recipe!",

I also poured most of it in a 9x13 pan and the rest in a 8x8 pan to be used later.  Nobody mind eating the leftovers!  Now that says something!",
