I love all the ingredients the salad had but maybe not all together as it was for myself I found me chewing extremely long with the coconut walnuts and the apples(overly crunchy in bites). Don't get me wrong. Didn't realize it until I have in my mouth before I judged. The flavors were okay the zing of the cranberries the sweet of the oranges. This recipe just was a hit and miss...some liked it some didn't. I was in the middle with it. Maybe if the apples were shredded & peeled less walnuts more grapes & oranges no coconut...that might be a tweak that may work....as is I won't be making again. As something to tweak for a better fitting for all my kids to like...might be a possibility. Sorry.",

My husband agreed; however my kids weren't sold. To each his own I guess.:) Bottom line: If you tend to like tropical fruit salad and the general taste of cranberry sauce you'll likely enjoy this. If you're not a huge fan of either this might not be your thing.",
