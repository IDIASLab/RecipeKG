I would have given it five stars, but, I think the ingredient ratio was off for the amount of pasta used.  I used 1 lb. of shrimp instead of half pound and  a full cup of peas.  I honestly think I could have used another half cup to  cup of peas.  I also cooked my shrimp in a frying pan with olive oil salt and pepper  while the pasta was boiling just  because it gives the shrimp more flavor than boiling.  Thanks for the recipe!",
