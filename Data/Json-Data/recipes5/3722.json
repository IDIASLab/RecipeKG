That, and having all the ingredients on hand, led me to this recipe. I seasoned the filets with salt, pepper and garlic powder before I spread the topping, then sprinkled on some paprika for color. Wow -both my husband and I really enjoyed it! Moist, flaky fish, with a rich, creamy topping that looked very attractive on the plate, especially with a sprinkle of finely chopped fresh parsley just before serving. Also a plus was that I was able to assemble this ahead of time and just pop it into the oven when I was ready to have dinner. I know this will not be the last appearance of this dish at our house! Thanks for the unique recipe!",

The halibut was very moist and perfectly done. I did embellish, as I almost always do. I used parmesean (lower fat), low fat mayo & sour cream, added 1 tsp lemon zest,1/2 tsp fish rub,1/2 tsp dill weed, and fresh ground pepper. I don't doubt it would have been just as good as posted without these additions; I just can't resist \"messing with\" recipes. Also, I baked it over fresh spinach (from another similar recipe). This was our vege accompaniment, along with a side of mashed potatoes.\nMy husband usually does not touch anything with sauce; he was delighted with this dish. He can't wait for me to serve it again!",
