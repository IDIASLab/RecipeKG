What was a problem was the texture of the cake after being chilled over night.  The cake which had a rich, cake-like texture after cooling to room temperature became fudge-like after being cooled overnight.  I tasted the cake both ways and do not feel that the flavor (which was very nice) improves with time.  I might make this again for a real chocolate diehard but I would definitely serve it same day at room temperature.",
