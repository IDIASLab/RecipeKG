I personally don't care for chicken legs, but they seemed like the perfect food for a cookout for a large crowd.   I was so sorry that they were eaten up so quickly!  I marinated the chicken legs overnight in a ziplock bag, then grilled them slowly over a gas grill.  Meanwhile, I boiled the marinade for about 10 minutes and added just a touch of corn starch.  When the legs were about done, I brushed them with the marinade and heated through.  I can't believe how great they were.",

I marinated 5 skinless, bone-in chicken thighs for 18 hours in the sauce (proportioned to 6 servings) in a ziploc bag, making sure to turn over halfway through so the meat was thoroughly marinated.  Grilled on low-medium heat for about 15 minutes per side, and served with veggie fried rice and a spinach sidedish.  While making the sides, I reduced the reserve marinade over the stovetop for about 20 minutes.  It made a super yummy sauce which was fantastic with the rest of the meal!  To sum up, the chicken turned out beautifully -- moist and flavourful with nice grill marks.  Even though it was not spicy at all, we still think it turned out perfectly.  :)",

Only change I made was the use of ground ginger (because that's what I had).  I cut back on the cayenne pepper just a bit because I'm a wimp when it comes to spice, but this just had a slight bite. Next time, I will let this marinate over night. One hour was good, so more must be better. We did this over low heat on the grill, about 25 minutes on each side. It was super moist. I think this marinade would be GREAT on ribs. Next time, we will probably throw this on the smoker and let it cook all day.Think it would be great served with grilled pineapple. Thanks!\nEdit: We marinated ribs in this for several hours and then smoked it. Absolutely great flavor, but if you're going to use it for ribs, I would suggest doubling the brown sugar. \nDo yourself a favor, make this recipe! We made a huge batch for a BBQ and everyone couldn't stop talking about it!",
