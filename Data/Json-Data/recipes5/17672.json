The sauce is a very very mild \"sweet and sour\" but you really have to \"taste\" for the sour. As other reviewers noted it is very sweet. So to the reviewer with the picky eater husband who complained they were too sweet he was right on. I really wanted something with more kick. I should have tried one of the recipes with the chili sauce. I brought this to a potluck last night and brought home more than half the meatballs so that should explain itself. I'll keep looking for a better recipe.",

I think I used too much tomato sauce but it was still good. I bought frozen meatballs let them defrost a little bit and then browned on medium heat first for ten minutes while I made the sauce. I was running short on time so I put the slow cooker on high for about 90 minutes and as soon as the sauce had a fairly smooth consistency and the meatballs were cooked all the way I turned it to low for the rest of the night. For vegetarians they do make seitan \"meat\"balls (which I made a seperate batch of on the stove) but I think you would be better off with \"meatless\" sausage links with this sauce if you have to go vegetarian.",
