However 1/2 the flour mixture and immediately take 1/2 of it out and store it in a Ziploc bag in the fridge until you want to use it again. The original recipe would probably coat 10 lbs of meat - seriously don't make that much and you can't save it after you drag the egg coated pieces through it. But this recipe is awesome for those of us eating venison and it is REALLY easy. Oh I also added probably 1/2 to a whole tablespoon of honey to the dipping sauce. It's good with or without it but it does have quite a 'bite' without the honey - just depends on how 'wild' you want to be that night...",

I also substituted 1 cup of panko for the flour. Cooked the meat only 3 minutes at 350 degrees as I was using backstrap and didn't want it to toughen from overcooking. The taste was heavenly! Very tender meat and the dipping sauce was a delight to the tongue! Highly recommended!",

So I tweaked the second batch - sprinkling them with a little worchestershire sauce as they cooled and cooking them for a shorter time. They only need a few minutes for small strips (not 10 minutes) the batch that I pulled out just when they started to turn a little gold was much better - crunchy but not tough.",

I replaced 2/3 cup of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and baked the strips instead of deep frying. To bake: preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. After coating strips arrange them in a single layer leaving a little space between each. Spray the strips with non-stick fat free cooking spray to moisten. Bake 15-20 minutes until golden brown and slightly crispy. Check on them every 5 minutes. For the dipping sauce I would recommend mixing the brown sugar and mustard together before heating or you may end up with a crystalized sugar mess like I did. Also I ended up with a lot of extra flour mixture and dipping sauce. Could probably cut amount of ingredients in half and still have plenty. Or increase venison steaks to 2 pounds. Thank you for the recipe MBC.",
