I don't understand the confusion over letting the bulgur and tomatoes sit together that one reviewer had. For me it worked perfectly and the bulgur tasted amazing, it just soaked up all of the flavour from the tomatoes and really blew my mind.  I will add tabbouleh to my rotation now and will always prepare bulgur this way,  think it was very valuable to learn, though I do think the quality of the tomatoes is important. However one problem with the recipe is that it doesn't state how large the tomatoes should be ! I ended up using 9 small very ripe tomatoes, which I estimated to be about the same as 6 medium to large tomatoes, having never made bulgur before I wasn't sure how large it would puff up, but by a stroke of luck the ratio was perfect. My second problem was the sieve I used, the fine bulgur actually passed straight through it, I ended up lining it with cheesecloth, in order to give the grain a good wash. The final result of the dressing I found to be extraordinary tart.  Lemon juice AND tomato paste, seemed a bit overkill, maybe because the tomatoes I used were so beautiful the bulgur actually already had a beautiful flavour from them and probably didn't need such an intense dressing, but I wanted to try the original recipe to know exactly what it was like. After trying the finished dish I ended up adding, garlic, 1 tsp of honey and finally half a finely chopped cucumber to try and dist",
