The jalapeno chips though . . . that is a true inspiration and has given me new ideas for cooking projects to come. I recommend adding a fresh jalapeno to the final product to compliment the subtle flavor of the chips that are used to make the pork chop coating. \n\nAlso - don't wrap in aluminum foil when in the oven! I did and it tore off a lot of the breading mixture when these were done cooking.",
