I left off the mint and chose to garnish these with just the lemon zest - overall very good!",

I used both blackberries and raspberries but rather than mixing the berries with powdered sugar I thought it would be even better to mix them with leftover homemade raspberry sauce! It was easy quick fresh and delicious and very pretty in little parfait glasses. I mean who doesn't like berries and cream? However while it was only a small amount I would have preferred this without the sour cream which provided just enough tang to make it not as pleasantly sweet as just simple whipped cream - it was a step and ingredient that didn't necessarily make it better.",
