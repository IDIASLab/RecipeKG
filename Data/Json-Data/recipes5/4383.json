To begin with, I used green onion rather than red, since that's what I had, but I don't think I would have particularly liked the bite of the red onion anyway (nor, probably, would anyone standing close to me).  I added the expected and predictable celery, but I also threw in some cooked, crumbled bacon. Really delicious.  I would have loved this on a sandwich but I didn't want to mess with this perfect, low-carb lunch.",

I read all the reviews in advance and so knew that for our tastes I should add celery and bacon as others have suggested. My problem with the recipe is that in my opinion the avocado/egg ratio is off. I halved the recipe so started with 3 avocados and 3 chopped eggs. The avocado completely overwhelmed the egg so I ended up adding 3 more chopped eggs to the 3 avocados. That was much more balanced. Even with the addition of celery and bacon we still felt this was on the bland side. We added in another 1/2 cup of onion and also added several shakes of Louisiana hot sauce to the mayo and milk mixture. Those changes resulted in something quite good but the original proportions of the recipe were for us not the most appealing.",
