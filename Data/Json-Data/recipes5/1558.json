I don't care where this recipe comes from,  tamales are not made with tomato sauce or products.  The red color comes from chile powder or chiles negro or other red chile not tomato.  We never use garlic.  This is a \"new\" addition.  At no restaurant will you find tamales made this way.  We have a long line of Mexican made tamales in our family I assure you.  If you want Tex-Mex, you can make a red chili with pork or add it to cooked roasted pork.  If you want Mexican tamales, you can roast or pressure cook your pork and use a mild chile powder or other prepared mild chiles with the pork to make a filling.  Use chili paste or powder, cumin, and oregano, and onions for your spices/herbs.   Tomatoes are only  typically used in pico de gallo, salsa, or salads  never in enchilada sauce or tamales if you want traditional.  The recipe posted here is very misleading as to what a true tamale should be.  Yes, there are variations but the basic ingredients I have given you here.  Let's keep it old school traditional.",
