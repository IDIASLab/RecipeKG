Made this early in the day and popped in the fridge.  Removed the pulp from a juicy, ripe tomato, stuffed it with the tuna salad, and served with crackers, sliced avocado and cantaloupe, a tasty light dinner.  So nice to see a tuna salad that doesn\u2019t incorporate mayo, and that fresh dill adds incredible fresh flavor to the high protein tuna.  flamingo1012, thanks for sharing, this one\u2019s a winner!",

I was a bit nervous about the amount of dill, but I like to make the recipe exactly as presented first before making any changes (I got a kick out of the woman who left a review but made it without the tuna--sort of like making beef stew without the beef). It was wonderful. Fresh, vibrant, colorful. The perfect summer lunch or light dinner. Right before serving, I chopped up some cherry tomatoes and sprinkled them on top. Yummilicious!",

Admittedly I did leave out the tuna and reduced the dill to 1 tablespoon of bottled dill since i was not sure how I would like the dill. I increased the chopped spinach to 2 cups. I also tried it with and without the chopped red pepper and I prefer the flavors with NO red pepper. It was so easy to make and was a very good and nutritious small salad. A nice change from the traditional salad. I will make it again.",
