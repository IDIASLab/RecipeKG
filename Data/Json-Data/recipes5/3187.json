I didn't use the specified amount of oil for the tomato mixture I just drizzled and tossed until combined...maybe only 1-2 tablespoons...and it was plenty. I did away with the step of warming the oil and garlic. I have always made my bruschetta by just brushing the slices with olive oil and then rubbing a crushed garlic clove across the top. I put the toasts on a platter and let everyone spoon the tomato topping on top so the bread wouldn't get soggy. Someone at the table (not me!) had about 8 slices!",

I cut down on some of fat by doing bread differently. I cut a garlic clove in half and rubbed it on the both sided of bread then toasted on my G. Foreman grill. I added shredded parmesan to top for a garnish. It was a big hit with my family! Will definately make again!",
