So the roast and other ingredients as well as a tablespoon of  Penzey's Italian dressing mix went into my shallow oval crockpot. I had to use canned mushrooms, one can of golden mushroom soup, and one can of mushroom with garlic. I also used chopped garlic instead of powder. 9 hours on low because the roast was still frozen in the middle. Yum!!!! served over creamy mashed potatoes and will be having biscuits and gravy for breakfast.",
