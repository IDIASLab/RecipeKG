One suggestion, since the shrimp should only be cooked for a short time, saute them separately and add after adding the quinoa.

Like another reviewer, we only used half of the shrimp required and it was still more than enough-I was thrilled because it made the recipe healthier and more economical.  I also omitted the raisins because my kids dislike \"cooked raisins', but I'd like to try an adult version some time that had the raisins and some extra heat (I was thinking sweet chile sauce).

I made it exactly as written except for omitting the raisins because I don't like them.  Very easy to make, healthy and delicious.  Next time I'll add an extra tablespoon of lemon juice to brighten the flavours up even more.  My husband suggested adding a bit of chopped jalapeno (he loves the Szechwan Shrimp from this site) but he likes a lot of heat in his food.  Thanks for a great recipe I'll make often!",
