I ALSO ADDED SOME BROWN SUGAR TO THE ICING, FROSTED THE CAKE WHILE WARM, AND CUT MYSELF A SLICE.  GOOD!! MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND ONE YEAR OLD SON LOVED IT AS WELL.

I don't use compound spices like pumpkin pie spice so I incorporated 1-1/2 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp ground nutmeg 1/2 tsp ground allspice and 1/2 tsp ground cloves. I wanted to make them easy to pack in a lunch so when I removed the baked bars from the oven I turned on the broiler and poured a mixture of 1/4 cup (half a stick) of melted butter 1/2 cup packed of brown sugar and 2 Tb milk over the top and broiled until the topping was bubbly. The result was nice and spicy plus wonderfully moist with a slightly crunchy top. My son couldn't wait until they were cool and cut himself 3 huge bars devouring them immediately. This one's a keeper.",
