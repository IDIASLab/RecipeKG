I tried many different recipes before I ran into this one and I have to say the secret to getting that perfect taste and texture is using the egg yolks instead of the whole egg. I placed the filled casserole dish into a larger pan and put water halfway into that pan and baked in a pre-heated oven @350 for 1 hour. Cover the casserole that has the flan with foil paper while in the oven.I need to try to simmer in the stove like the recipes says either way this is a very easy and wonderful recipe.",

UPDATE: After typing in flan in \"Tips & Advice\" I see that my mistake was not cooking my sugar mixture long enough on the stove. I only cooked to amber and should have let it go to brown.",

It's extremely creamy and a little on the rich side. I can't wait to experiment with flavors on this recipe. I baked it in the oven in a pan of water and covered in tin foil on 350 like other reviewer suggested worked perfectly. It's like baking a cheesecake in that sense. Extremely easy to make and the results couldn't be better. Will make this many many times. Only issue I had was spreading the caramel over the bottom of the pan but that's probably just my lack of experience with caramel!:o) A must try recipe!",

But it still had a good flavor and was completely gone at the potluck I took it to. The brown sugar in the bottom did not all come out with the flan when I inverted it so much of it was still had stuck to the inside of the pan. Very difficult to clean (my husband can attest to it.) I did steam the flan in the oven. If I make it again I will use a different carmel sauce.",
