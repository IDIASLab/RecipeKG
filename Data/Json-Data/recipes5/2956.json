I will give it that it calls for just good fresh ingredients so you're doing yourself a favor by choosing and eating this dish particularly if you can avoid the rice you'd expect to accompany it. For extra color I used a medley of sweet mini peppers and because I had them to use a mix of exotic mushrooms. This needed a boost of something not the least of which was just salt (or more soy sauce) to heighten flavors and after I added it it DID help. In all fairness I do admit to skipping the ginger because I don't care for it but I don't think you can make or break this dish on that basis alone. What I like most about this is that there's just no guilt or remorse after eating it.",
