Beef didn't come out as crispy as I might have liked, but I wasn't able to slice it \"paper thin\" either. Nonetheless, it was extremely tender and flavorful. I did make one little addition in adding a \"glug\" of Riesling to the sauce mixture. Next time I make this, I think I'll double the sauce part of the recipe (except for the OJ concentrate... it's orangey enough) so as to have more to put over the rice. Served with broccoli as well. Heaven on a plate, Diane... keep your recipe's coming!",

They ended up sticking to the bottom of my non-stick wok, so those ingredients crisped up, but the beef didn't. Made this with broccoli, and served with steamed rice.

After the beef is finished cooking heat the oil and saute the garlic and ginger for about 1 minute. Don't let the garlic burn. Then add the orange peel and the other ingredients.

I used powdered ginger and garlic instead of fresh and I just put it along with my orange zest in the sauce mixture then cooked my sauce mixture until thickened. I added cooked frozen broccoli to the sauce(if you add it still frozen it could water down the sauce) and then finally added the deep fried beef and stirred everything to coat with sauce.

Plus I decided to add some veggies (a head of broccoli a red bell pepper and a small red onion). I didn't have any frozen juice concentrate so I juiced two lemons and three mandarin oranges mixed them with 2 tbsp. sugar and cooked it down till it reduced by half. I also didn't have any rice vinegar so I used white. The meat was tender and the sauce was tangy. I only wish the meat was crisper on the outside but the cornstarch it was marinated in started making the meat a bit liquidy even before I added the orange sauce. It was great overall and I look forward to leftovers tomorrow!:)",
