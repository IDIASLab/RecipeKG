I omitted the onion and I added raw corn cut from the cob for some texture and a little sweetness. I also chopped a third avocado and stirred it in. I blended in about 1/3 cup of cilantro added 1 tsp of sea salt and added a sprinkle of cumin to each bowl. I may add garlic next time. A note about the flavor: With 32 oz of tomato juice this is not going to taste like avocado. The avocado is used only to add a creamy texture. This soup has a nice flavor but if you're looking for an avocado-flavored soup this isn't it.",

I made steamed asparagus minted corn and goat cheese baguette and shrimp in a parsley and garlic sauce with it(I had to feed a whole lot of people) and it was all OK except maybe for the asparagus (it just doesn't really fit). Everything has been eaten. It really is a bit intense for a main dish I think it would be fantastic as a starter.",

I did saute the onion and the bell pepper just a tad before adding them to the soup because my family would not have enjoyed it as much if those ingredients were too overpowering. I also seasoned it with a little black pepper (in addition to the cayenne) and I only used 2.5 cups (20 oz) of vegetable juice instead of a quart of tomato juice. I really wanted to taste the avocado because I was using some nice ripe ones. I processed it in a food processor and then put it in a blender to make it smoother and I really don't think it looked unappealing at all. It has a similar texture and color to many bisque-like soups. Once it was garnished it actually looked quite pleasant and it turned out to be tasty as well. This recipe may not fit everyone's personal taste but it is certainly worth a try! I will definitely make it again!:) Thanks for submitting it!",
