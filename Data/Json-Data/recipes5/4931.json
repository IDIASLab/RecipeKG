The cut of salmon I purchased was a bit too thick masking the flavor of the crab. I also sliced the gouda too thinly making it almost non-existant in the dish. I was afraid the cheese would override the flavor of both the salmon and crab. The dill sauce turned out phenomenal! I added a little more dill then called for because I love dill((about three tablespoons))! I also doubled the lemon butter sauce and really coated the fillets((only made 2 fillets))! This recipe is definently a keeper!!! Can't wait to make it again!",

Like many others I have a tendency to modify recipes but when I try one for the first time unless we are missing an ingredient I stick to it and make notes on how to modify it for future. No modifications necessary it was perfect. I might look for a better quality of lump crabmeat next time. The canned crabmeat we had was more like shredded crab. This recipe is definitely a keeper!",
