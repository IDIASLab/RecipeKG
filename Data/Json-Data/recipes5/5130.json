Here is a raw, live, vegan alternative that really stands up for applause! Serve over gently chopped broccoli (food processor may over-chop and thus juice your broccoli!), chopped asparagus, and any other food you would normally top with a cheese sauce. This is also a fabulous dip, room temp or cold. Take a walk on the alive food side...",

I do not like cheese on my veggies and if I can find a way to keep cheese out of my recipes I will. Having said that this recipe is really good. I added a bit more lemon than written and and added more turmeric. This went nicely with some chips. I also used it on a sandwich with toasted bread which proved messy but good. It goes very nicely with pickles capers and pickled jalape\u00f1os. I am betting that this will make a wonderful jalape\u00f1o popper. I will report back. Thank you for the recipe. It is wonderful!",
