In the morning I dipped them in the melted chocolate and topped some with more toffee bits and others with chocolate jimmies.

If you make this change you can also reduce the amount of flour to 1 and 1/4 cups. The dough is much easier to work with if you make these changes. You won't get as many truffles but they work out better. I always freeze them for about 2 hours before dipping too. I do not use toffee bits just the mini chips. These also turn out just the same using fat free sweetened condensed milk. These work really well in the cookie dough cupcakes on the site too!",

I followed previous advice and added a pinch of baking soda to make it taste more like regular cookie dough. I also added just a hint more vanilla and 1/4 a cup of my flour was whole wheat. Of course refrigeration or even freezing is necessary. This recipe takes time! I would not recommend pulling all of the dough balls out at once to dip because they will warm up before the first half are dipped in the chocolate. Diabetics be warn! This is a VERY sweet dessert that is hard to stay away from. I also used tooth picks to dip the balls for a much neater and professional looking chocolate coating. You may also need to frequently re-microwave the chocolate to keep it nice and liquidy.",
