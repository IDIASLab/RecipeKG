I made the recipe as written (including the rice brand) except I used 2 cloves garlic instead of 3 (I thought it may have been too much garlic for us). I used a Braeburn apple. The chicken fell apart easily with a fork right in the Instant Pot; no need to remove it to shred. It was neither too soupy nor too dry. It sat in the Pot on \"warm\" for an hour after cooking, as our dinnertime was pushed back. \nPerhaps adding some sliced green onion would perk it up a bit. I'm not a super onion-y person, but perhaps a little more onion (I used yellow) would  work. Of course, that 3rd clove of garlic may have done the trick....",
