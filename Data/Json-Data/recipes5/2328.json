Maybe my kitchen was too warm but when I tried to roll it out all it did was smear.  I tried putting in the fridge for a bit but that didn't help either. I pressed the dough into the dish using my fingers and for the top layer of my pot pie I just crumbled the dough on top. Also I think 450 is too high. I used a glass dish and the dough almost burned but only in the center. The taste was pretty good though and the dish turned out fine.",
