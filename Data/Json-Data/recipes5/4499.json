I think next time I would partially cook the asparagus and then add.  I ended up adding about a 1/4 C of butter for the sauce.  It also needed a bit of salt and pepper, but the recipe stated to taste.  I would do this again, but with some slight modifications.  Actually I make a similar one that is from Barefoot Contessa and I think I wilol add the asparagus to that.  Thanks for sharing.",

Because of the mention of the excess liquid,  I had a jar of Penzy's powdered lemon zest that I used in lieu of the juice.  I bet fresh would be even better. I added 1/4 cup of a can of petite diced tomatoes & to counterbalance the acid, I put in 1 pinch (literally) of white sugar. It did not give any sweetness, just balanced the acid content. To also help with the liquid issue, I cooked the pasta (I used spaghetti) 2 minutes short  of done, and then tossed it into the pan of sauce & cooked it for the remaining 2 minutes there. \n\nThanks for the great recipe!",

I found this recipe & it totally fit the bill :)  The only change I made was adding a can of undrained garlic, basil & oregano diced tomatoes (as I had read that some reviewers thought the sauce was a little thin).
