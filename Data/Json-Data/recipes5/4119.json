I marinated the chicken for a day to give it extra flavor and instead of just using plain mango and avocado chunks I combined them with the juice of one lime and some fresh cilantro and parsley to make more of a \"salsa.\" The chicken was moist and flavorful the salsa was amazing and the citrus sauce complimented it perfectly. I served this with some frozen corn seasoned with butter salt pepper and dried thyme leaves. My fiancee called this meal \"crazy tasty\" which is his highest honor! I'll be making this one again soon. The only thing I'll change is that I'll probably add more red pepper to the marinade next time as this wasn't 'spicy' at all but other than that I'd say it was pretty perfect.",

I took a chance and used Sriracha hot sauce (what looked to be the amount of the missing pepper) and omitted the salt. Second I used cumin powder instead of seeds (one teaspoon). Third I used two teaspoons lime juice instead of the lime zest (I just didn't feel like zesting the lime). Fourth I reduced the butter to 1 tablespoon. I poked holes in the chicken and marinated for 6 hours. It had a nice kick not too spicy. I could have drank the sauce it was so good!",
