I'm new to grilling and used my propane grill with some hickory chips hoping for a smoky  flavor.  The recipe was spot on--8 minutes each side with my temperature at 350.  The sauce was also delicious.  I served it with cauliflower-gnocchi and the sauce really elevated this otherwise bland vegetable side dish.  I also served a side of broccoli with lemon juice.  I'll make this again.  And I concur with the previous reviewer: this sauce would be amazing over just about any type of protein (beef, chicken or fish).",

Flank steak is a thinner piece of meat, so resting it 15 min only achieves cold meet.  Any piece of meet that is 1\" or less in thickness needs no resting time.  There is no place for the juices to redistribute in something that thin.  If you still believe in resting, just put it on the table covered and by the time you are all seated it has satisfied your resting time.",
