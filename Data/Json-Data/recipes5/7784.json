Well 1 teaspoon was STILL way too much to the point where I couldn't even eat it and I love salty foods! I didn't even bother trying to fix it by adding in another can of beans. I hate to waste food but in reality the can of beans was only 0.89 and not worth saving. If you're going to make this only use 1/2 teaspoon of salt MAX! (you might even want to start with 1/4 teaspoon) I took a photo anyway however I ended up making another dip to go with my crackers.",
