So, I happen to have all the Asian stuff and here's a lil' cheat I do: I always keep bottled lemon and lime juice on hand. Yeah, yeah, fresh is better but unless, I need the actual lemon or lime skin or pulp, no one seems to notice the difference. I fixed this for a simple kale salad with arugula, pumpkin seeds and roasted pineapple.  This was a surprise hit. My wonderful son-in-law said that the \"salad dressing was amazing!\" I ended up leaving the rest at my daughter's house. My son-in-law  made pulled pork sandwiches  which wench t amazing with the salad and the dressing. This may very well be the best salad dressing I ever made. And I've made a few. I just through all the ingredients in a blender and voil\u00e0! It's kind of on the runny side, not thick or creamy, but it's oh, so good!",
