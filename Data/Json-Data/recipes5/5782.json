I felt that if you added all the wet ingredients and mixed them until smooth and creamy, then add half the salmon blend to incorporate and then fold in the rest of the ingredients, it helps to keep the salmon in the spotlight on your pallet.   Oh and rinse and rough chop the capers.  (Great with almond gluten free crackers)",

I've been making another one for years, but  the addition of capers is incredible. I was a bit short on cream cheese (about an ounce),so I made up the difference with sour cream. I also added about 1.5oz more smoked salmon that I had on hand. Very rich and great on crackers. Thanks...... Update: I have made this several times, learning to add all the ingredients \"to taste\", and always adding some sour cream because I enjoyed that flavor.  Very easy and versatile recipe that can't be messed up.",
