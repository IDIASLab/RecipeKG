First, either tomatoes OR salsa is sufficient (I used \"mexican\" seasoned stewed tomatoes - way cheaper than salsa and just as flavorful). Second, next time I will add extra veggies (corn, zucchini, carrots, etc) to the mix. Third, I had a hard time layering! Next time I will mix everything together except the cheese and tortillas - it's a casserole after all :)  Finally, I had to use a 9x12 or so baking dish! There's no way that volume of food would fit in an 8x8. Oh, and I used corn tortillas - still unrefined (as is whole wheat) but more flavor and texture. Thanks for a new go-to recipe - this will be a great one for a week's worth of dinners! ",

We make it in a 13x9 like this: First lay down 2 tortillas side by side. Cover in refried beans. We use a small can of green chiles instead of jalapenos out of personal preference. Layer the rest of the ingredients in any order: peppers rice all of the TVP mixture salsa & cheese. Top with 2 more tortillas remaining refried beans some salsa we add diced onion here & the remaining cheese. We serve with Mexicorn on the side would be great in the dish as well maybe with some black beans as well. Top with sour cream corn on the side. It's really impossible to mess this dish up so change it up to what suits your needs & it will most likely still be great.",

One reviewer wrote that canned tomatoes plus salsa was overkill so in place of the huge can of whole tomatoes I used a 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes which I just dumped in not bothering to save the 1/4 cup for later. This worked out to be the perfect amount of liquid for my 1 lb. of meat. Also used a larger casserole which it filled so do not even attempt the 8x8. Mixed diced jalape\u00f1os right in with meat instead of layering. I think sliced black olives on the top layer would have been a nice addition.",

I left out the soy burger-style crumbles just because I have no interest in trying them. I cooked the veg. refried beans in a saucepan with a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos with none of the juices drained out. I added in my own taco seasoning instead of a packet. I used 4 fresh jalapenos and 1/4 of an onion that I threw in the pan with the beans and tomatoes. I also threw the salsa in the with the beans and the rice once it was cooked so I wouldn't have to do so much layering. I did a whole wheat tortilla then bean mixture and cheese another tortilla bean mixture and cheese then another tortilla and topped that with the rest of the cheese. I think this cooked 40 minutes altogether and I only let it rest 5 before I cut it ( I was too hungry to wait anymore! ) Will make again thanks for the great recipe.",
