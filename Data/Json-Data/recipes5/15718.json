They are a hit with my family--especially the kids and I took them to a meal swap where they were a favorite! I changed the recipe up some... First I omitted the salt. With the packaged taco seasoning it didn't need anymore salt. Second I added a tsp more cumin and used an entire onion. I also use kidney beans instead of pinto and plan to make them with black beans one of these times! I also use olive oil instead of peanut oil in the mixture and for frying. As with traditional falfalfel it's better to add the bread crumbs and let the mixture set at least 30 minutes. Much easier to form and fry! I do not deep fat fry mine but rather skillet fry and I make patties vs balls. Also it has always taken 1 1/2c bread crumbs vs 1 cup. Again they fry much better when dryer. Serve with homemade salsa and you have an incredible meal! Enjoy! (PS--sometimes I also serve with tortillas fresh tomatoes and lettuce)!",

The only adjustments I made were that I used my own taco seasoning mix (chili powder, cumin, garlic powder) and I added a splash of lime juice into the mix. I pan fried them in about an inch of grapeseed oil. My five year old LOVED them, and he's really picky! The three year old ironically did not, but we just never know with him. I thought they were VERY VERY good dipped in sour cream and salsa! I saved some and made into burger-sized patties because I think these would work great as a veggie burger :)",
