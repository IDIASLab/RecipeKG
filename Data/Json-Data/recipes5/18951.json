        "description": "I live in Cambodia, and from January to May the markets are always full of ripe juicy mangoes. The problem is, I've never really found a way to use them in a dessert. So when I was looking at a recipe for an apple crumble I decided to substitute the apple with mango and with a few of my own alterations, it's been a family favorite! The passion fruit really brings that extra tangy taste to the mangoes. Serve this dish with vanilla ice cream or even some plain youghurt, it's delicious.",

I used sweet ripe mangoes but the addition of the lime and passionfruit made it so tart I feel it would have needed some extra sugar (mixed with the fruit) to be a dessert served to guests. (I usually cut sugar in recipes so don't have an unusually sweet tooth.) But the idea and mix of fruits are great and I will definitely be making this again. (PS: Mango cobbler is another delicious way to use up a lot of mangoes.)",
