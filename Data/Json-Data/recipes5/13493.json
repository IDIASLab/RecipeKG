I used Sherry Wine vinegar instead of apple cider and didn't use the egg substitute either (I'm not sure why you would anyway). I used boneless skinless thighs and they were so tender and tasty.

I believe the egg is absolutely necessary to make the marinade \"stick\" to the chicken. 2) I use chicken thighs WITH the skin on. When I pan fry these the skin creates a flavorful crust that is keeps the meat even more most than normal and 3) I agree with the others that 1 TBS of salt is a bit much so I cut it down to 1/2 TBS. This also freezes beautifully. If you can marinate this overnight. I have made this at varying \"marination\" times. The flavor is 100% more pleasing when it's marinated overnight. Oh and these freeze beautifully! Thank you Al!",
