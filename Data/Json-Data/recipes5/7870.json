I even had a small jar of preserves that was expiring and needed to be used.\n\nI debated on removing a star because of the cake mix extender. It isn't necessary.  Its a cake in a 9x13 pan. Not like you are making a 3 tier cake. And its only 3oz of extender.\n Then there are at least 3 types of extenders most of them have their own wet ingredients and the extender recipes usually make at least 1 cup.  \n\nSo if you are reading this rest assured you dont need the extender. NOTE: you will need to make the cake mix as written on the box ignoring the parts/ingredients of this recipe that pertain to making the cake mix. \n\nSo make the cake mix from the box instructions, cool, poke holes and then follow the recipe for the strawberry topping.",
