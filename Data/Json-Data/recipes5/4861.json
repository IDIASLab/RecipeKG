AR edited this before publishing and they say to lay the tenderloin into the lemon juice/broth mixture.  I don't do that.  My pressure cooker has a \"rack\" that keeps the meat above the liquid so it doesn't actually sit in the liquid as it cooks.  This could affect flavor and texture so I'd be interested in hearing your experience if you cook it right in the liquid.  AR also converted my \"a good handful\" of cilantro leaves into 1/4 cup.  I use more than 1/4 cup and I also use a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of the red pepper flakes and a scant 1/4 teaspoon of the salt.  As you can see, it's a very flexible recipe!  The original idea for the marinade comes from my friend, Angela, with a few modifications.",
