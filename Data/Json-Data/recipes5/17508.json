It is a classic Christmas dessert \"Down Under\". I had to use tapioca instead of sago since you cannot find sago in an average US grocery store. After the tapioca soaks overnight cook it over low heat in a saucepan until soft and clear - otherwise your tapioca in the finished pudding will be crunchy. Serve it topped with a warm custard sauce. Can be made 3 days ahead and freezes well.",
