I doubled the recipe as follows: 1/2 c. apple cider vinegar 1 cup ketchup 3/4 c. water 1/2 c. brown sugar sprinkle of Lawry's seasoning a couple dashes of worcestersire sauce and... I sauteed a 1/4 of a small onion (chopped fine)and 1 chopped garlic clove and tossed it all in the bowl at the same time. I did make a couple of squirts of ketchup to make a thicker consistency. After all that....I had some boneless pork ribs tossed them in the crockpot and put the BBQ mixture over the top. Stirred together and cooked about 4 hrs. on high then turned to low until we were ready for dinner. When we were ready to eat I took a large slotted spoon and separated the pork. I then ladled it onto good hamburger buns and even the kids ate all their dinner! I think next time I will use the Hawaiian buns. Overall YUMMY!! (even hubby said so and he doesn't say things too often!)",
