Because I didn't want it too tart I didn't add the lemon and added a few tablespoons of real maple syrup which made all the difference. Next time I will only use 3 cinammon sticks because I don't like cider that's so spiced that your mouth feels overwhelmed and I don't want to lose the flavor of the apples. Served this at a baby shower and the guests loved it.",
