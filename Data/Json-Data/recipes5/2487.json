Roast beef, jack cheese, green chiles; pizza sauce, pepperoni, sausage mozzerella and provolone -- endless possibilities; all great party food or Friday family movie night munchies! Oh!  Bake the bottom crescent layer for 6-7 min's before layering on the rest...it helps it bake up nicely with no soggy/smushy spots.",
