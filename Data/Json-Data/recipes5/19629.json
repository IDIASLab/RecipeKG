However, when I make these cookies again, I will not pre-cook the filling.  Doing so can make the filling too hard/chewy in the even that the cookies over bake, and it is easy to over bake these so watch carefully.  When I make these again I will simply combine the ingredients and fill as per the recipe directions.  Do not be tempted to use more than the specified amount of filling or the filling will bubble out of the muffin cups as the cookies bake.  I also feel the filling could benefit from some flavoring.  I added 1 1/2 teaspoons dark rum and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla.  The addition of these 2 ingredients really made for some delicious cookies.  With some changes, this is a very tasty cookie that is certainly worth making.",

Don't cook the filling either- that turns it to candy.  Just melt the butter and stir in the brown sugar until it is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in the corn syrup and pecans.  Doesn't even need cooled in the fridge. Will be proudly sharing these at a cookie exchange soon!",
