I followed other reviewers advice and patted the fish dry (frozen and thawed IQF flounder) and then brushed with lemon juice. Then under the broiler for 3 minutes. I mixed the parm, mayo and some italian style bread crumbs together and added the mix to the broiled fish and returned to the oven for another 3-4 min under the broiler, watching to make sure it didn't burn. Delicious! Even my non-fish eater son ate it without complaint. Thanks for a recipe I can use on other fish filets!",

I ommitted the butter as I was using lower fat mayo and adding butter seemed counterproductive! I broiled until I could see it getting a bit flaky.  Midway through, I used a knife to respread the mayo mix so it would not burn.  Turned out perfect and not mushy! M.A.",

Rather than green onion I just sprinkled some parsley flakes into the topping mixture. I also sprinkled a bit of garlic powder on the fillets and broiled for about 3-5 minutes then added the topping and broiled for an additional 3-5 minutes.

I used a LOT more lemon juice than called for since I love the citrusy zing it imparts on fish. To the mayo/cheese mixture I sprinkled in some onion & garlic powders paprika some dried parsley and dried chopped onion since I didn't have green. I also liberally sprinkled the same spice mixture over the fish and used sea salt to taste. I didn't want to bother with lining and/or cleaning a baking dish so I just sprayed Pam in a foil 9x13\" pan. DH really liked it; so did I but it's not the healthiest dinner ever so it'll be reserved for a \"once in a while\" meal. Thanks!",
