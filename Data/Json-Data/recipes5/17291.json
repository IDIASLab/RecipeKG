I pulled meat off a rotisserie chicken and added it before simmering for 2 1/2 hours in addition to the smoked sausage. One thing I would change: I would make the roux (bacon fat/oil/flour) by itself first stirring constantly until it was the color of dark peanut butter; then I'd add the veggies to cook them down. In following the instrux as noted I found that the flour mixture kept sticking to the bottom of the pan and never achieved a gravy-like consistency which apparently it should have. But the taste is outstanding so even following the instrux to a T resulted in delicious gumbo!",
