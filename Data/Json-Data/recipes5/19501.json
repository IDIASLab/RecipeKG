The other thing I did was just to throw all of the ingredients in the crockpot, except the cornstarch.  When the chicken pieces were cooked, I took them out temporarily and whisked in the corn starch. Then I added the chicken back in and let it simmer for a few hours more.  I think that cooking it in the crockpot keeps the chicken moist.  So easy and I normally keep all the ingredients on hand.",

The sauce was pretty sweet, but I also didn't have crushed red pepper flakes. Some spicy Mrs. Dash at the end didn't punch it up enough, but I am sure some spice will cut the sweetness nicely. My own personal twist: with about 5 minutes of cook time left, I diced a peach into fairly large chunks and threw them in. They came out soft and delicious. Served over rice.",

I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs and it came out tasting just like the Bourbon chicken at the mall! Used Jack Daniels instead of Southern Comfort because that's what we had. After letting the chicken chunks simmer in the sauce for 20 minutes I took out the chicken and cranked up the heat to med-high and boiled for a few minutes to help cook off some of the alcohol smell and reduce the sauce even more before whisking in the slurry mixture. In the future I may also reduce the amount of soy sauce. But overall this recipe with the changes was fantastic. Definitely a keeper!",
