I've made this a couple times and it will now be a weekly staple  because I almost always have everything I need already in the house! This is really, really good. I add garlic as well. I've made it without flour on the chicken and with flour. Both ways are great, but I prefer the flour.  Excellent recipe-THANK YOU!",
