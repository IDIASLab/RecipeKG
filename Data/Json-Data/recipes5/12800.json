I used a whole pound of bacon-sauteed that until crispy- drained off most of the grease (left about 2Tbsp.) sauteed a small onion with the garilc- added some dried basil and cayenne pepper- and added the tomatoes (I used tomatoes with green chiles) while I cooked the pasta.  Once the pasta was almost done, I added the spinach to the tomato mixture and then drained the pasta and added it to the tomatoes.  Once I brought it to the table, I served it with parmesan cheese.  YUM-O!! My husband said 4.  I said 5 because I think it's great.  This would be good at room temp as a buffet dish, I think it'll be great as leftovers and would be awesome with some grilled chicken and mushrooms.  Great recipe with lots of room to personalize!  Thanks for an awesome start to a great meal!  Served with garlic bread and a green salad.",

I put some spinach in the skillet and some in the pasta drainer to test both ways. It's good both ways. The strainer/colander spinach was just bland and wilted.  The skillet spinach absorbed bacon flavor, so I recommend the skillet spinach version. (Already putting in a pound of bacon, we're not exactly watching our figure here.) I added onions and garlic to the cooked/drained bacon. And at the end I added some cream to the skillet before dumping it over the pasta.  This was really good.",

Mine is not a tomato-friendly household (neither of us can stand the things!) so I used a small jar of sliced roasted red peppers (drained) in place of the tomatoes. I sprinkled some crumbled Feta cheese over the top just before serving and it was a great light meal. I also used this basic idea for a pasta side dish except I used orzo in place of penne and I sliced the spinach chiffonnade-style to make the leaf size more suited to the pasta. Great versatile recipe!",
