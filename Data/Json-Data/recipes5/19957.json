I omitted the chicken because I'm vegetarian and reduced the oil to 1 tsp (I assumed not all of it would make it into the slow cooker after the chicken was done cooking) but kept everything else the same. It was DELICIOUS. I love the combination of sweet and sour and salty and savory. Super easy and great for a farmer's market basket full of asparagus! It's not quite a meal on its own so I'd recommend serving it over rice or with crusty bread.",

That way I could just toss it all in the slow cooker before I left for work. When i opened the container with the sauce I wanted to just eat it right there! I didn't brown the chicken before I put it in mainly because I knew I was going to be gone all day and that it would cook in the slow-cooker. I also didn't add the asparagus for the same reason. The chicken unfortunately turned out a little dry for me but that's partially due to the fact that I had to let it cook longer than I would like. I would love to use the sauce to cook the chicken either on the stovetop on in the oven. I will definitely be using it as a marinade going forward! As for the pears my husband found out he doesn't like them (awesome timing huh?) so next time I think I might use apples (something he WILL eat.) Otherwise good recipe I just might tweak it so my chicken doesn't dry out. Seriously though the sauce. DIVINE!",
