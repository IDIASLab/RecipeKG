The joke was on me! I used self rising flour and omitted the soda and salt. I didn't have any buttermilk so I just used 2% instead. Other than that I didn't change a thing. Oh I rinsed the kraut many many times then I took kitchen sissors and cut it up very fine. My kids won't eat coconut because of the texture...I was trying to avoid that. It almost looked like a chocolate mousse when I poured it into the pan. I didn't know what to expect. But the house sure smelled good. It cooked for the full 45 minutes. Afterwards I trimmed the top so I would lay flat on my pan. I didn't tell one about the kraut and the kids went to town on it! You can see the kraut just a bit but not too much. They loved it. Very moist and good especially warm. We won't frost this one...and I'll be sure to make it again and again. This one is very much worth a try!",

I made as cupcakes (baked for right around 20 min a batch and the recipe made 30 cupcakes for me) and 2.  I never have buttermilk so I used the milk (1% at our house) and vinegar substitution.  I should probably make it known that I'm NOT a from scratch cake fan; I tend to prefer Duncan Hines box mixes, so I baked these more for the novelty of the sauerkraut w/low expectations...well, they certainly exceeded the low bar I had set!  These are great!  great flavor...I'm not sure what the sauerkraut does (some bites I felt I could get the barest hint of sauerkraut, but maybe it was all in my head), but these are def worth trying!  I frosted w/butter cream (butter cream II from here, actually) but next time I think I'll try w/either a cinnamon-y or a caramel or a PB or a mint frosting (the possibilities are endless!) thanks to the suggestions of wonderful RE members.

I was saddled with the task of making a cake for a going-away party for a co-worker and thought I would make this as a revenge of sorts. I very roughly chopped the sauerkraut because I was going to put coconut frosting on the cake anyway and figured that if anyone got some stringy bits they would just think it was coconut. Nobody suspected anything. I got nothing but rave reviews. Even when I got a piece of what I knew was sauerkraut and bit into it all I could taste was chocolate. This cake is so delicious and chocolatey. I recommend it to anyone who wants to try something different!",
