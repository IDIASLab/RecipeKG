My changes were: didn't overdo the butter, used less than 2 tablespoon, brushed phyllo with butter , I'm thinking I will not even put butter on the bottom layer next time, it was a still a little too greasy, soggy for me (on the bottom (no one else complained),layered dough in between, didn't put spinach mixture to the edge of the dough so the browning was beautiful, used 3 cloves of sauteed minced garlic cloves instead of garlic powder, DID NOT use the processed cheese, yuck, only used 2 cups of mozzarella, and only used 8 oz of feta, 4 oz regular, and 4 oz low-fat feta to cut the calories, like you care at this point LOL.  Served at a large family gathering and young and old raved. Several family members took the measly leftovers home and had them for lunch the next day. 2 e-mails to me the next day were similiar- they had to guard their lunches from co-workers. I will definitely make this again.",

I multiplied it to show for feeding 32, and made two large casseroles in my corningware casserole cooking pans.  It was all eaten except for two small pieces!  The only thing I did different than the original recipe is that I exchanged the process cheese food for the real medium cheddar cheese, per a suggestion from another reader.  The feta cheese amount is just right, and the whole thing got rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  This is an attractive dish.  Also, since I made it the night before our big luncheon, I just want to say it re-heats nicely without too much problem with the philo dough. So when I cooked it, I cooled it down, then covered it with foil then refridgerated it overnight.  I took it out of the 'fridge in the morning about two hours before I had to reheat it so it would come to room temperature. I turned the oven onto the same as the cooking temp (425 degrees) though a lower temp could easily be used.  I warmed it up for fifteen minutes or so.  Advice on reheating:  keep an eye on it as it is cooking - the philo dough got a little brown around the edges, but turned out just fine.",

I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and sauteed 3 cloves of garlic instead of using garlic powder, did NOT use the processed cheese and made a couple layers of spinach instead of just one.  I also used 20 oz of fresh spinach instead of frozen, an italian cheese mix instead of just mozzarella, and an egg wash in-between layers instead of butter.  In fact, I did not use any butter what-so-ever.  As for the phyllo, I wound up using half of a 16 oz package, randomly laying down layers, about 4 to 6 per layer.  And I have learned that phyllo can be very forgiving, so do not worry about small tears.  In the end, no one will notice, nor will they care since this is soooooo good!",

Used NO butter. Lightly coated each layer of dough with egg. Put 5 layers on the bottom a bunch of the mixture 5 more layers some mixture a few more layers some mixture and 5 on top. YUM!!

That would tone down the cheese and make it more substansial as a stand alone dish. This would also make a very good dip! It tasted great with some chips. I'm sure with the right bread it would be great too. We also took the butter down a notch and it tasted fine. Great recipe thanks so much for sharing!",
