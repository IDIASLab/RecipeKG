I tried this because I was tired of spending 2.50 for a lil package of frozen stuff. Melt a small amount of milk with the butter and seasoning then add the cheese and stir. This will make it the more creamy sauce if you are looking for something similar to the green giant variety. It also looks better and works for any kind of cheese.",
