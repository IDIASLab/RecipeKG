Guacamole without avacadoo is almost as much fun as making apple pie without the apples(Try the Mock Apple Pie recipe!) After I made it with one cup of peas I tasted it and then realized that I definitely was going to need more because I got hooked on that flavor. So I just added another half a cup of peas a ts of water and just blended again. Perfect without having to add any more oil. I only used a third ts of cumin a pinch of chilli powder for the red pepper and the juice of a whole lime for the lemon juice. While it couldn't replicate guacamole's flavor exactly it came pretty close and yet was delicious in its own way. I served it with beef fajitas which matched it perfectly. I think it would be great on a tortilla with melted monterrey jack. In fact I'm convinced that some restaurants probably do use this(maybe with a more olive oil to recreate more of that rich flavor) instead of guacomole to save a little money. I just have a feeling I've tried it before. Best part: my family practically licked the bowl.",
