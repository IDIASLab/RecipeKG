I found I had to increase the filling by half as the amount called for was not enough to fill my pie plate sufficiently (I did not use a ready made crust but made my own in a regular round pie plate). It was so soft I worried it would not set up right but after a night in the fridge it served perfectly. I topped it with fresh halved strawberries which made it pretty and gave it a little extra something. Oh and P.S. there is a misprint in the recipe- most people will figure out that you need an 8 oz package of cream cheese (in my case I needed 12 oz) NOT a 3 oz. package as the recipe says- but just in case anyone was wondering thought I'd mention it.",

It takes hardly any time to make other than letting it chill overnight which is necessary (I found out after we impatiently tried it five hours after having made it). It is a perfect pie. I would recommend the Oreo cookie pre-baked pie crust for this one. Beautiful contrast in colors and flavors and for the white chocolate drizzle on the top I heat the last of the white chocolate squares with a lot of heavy cream to make it nice and runny then I drizzle it over the top. A wonderful recipe that is as appealing to the eye as it is to the palate. Thanks so much for this gem!",

                "reviewBody": "I love this pie. I make it for parties all the time and it always gets eaten. I don't find it too sweet as the cream cheese counters the sugar but if you aren't into very sweet things you might want to cut down the sugar a bit- it'll still taste great. Another idea if you find the pie too sweet is to dilute the white chocolate mixture with a bit more cream than is called for. The one thing you have to be careful of is the melted chocolate mixture being too warm and melting the whipped cream. If it does this don't worry just pour it into the pie shell and leave to set. You will get a different texture this way but it will taste the same. However if this occurs you may end up overfilling your pie shell if you use all the mixture. Oh well more mixture to eat (mwahahaha). The first time I tried this pie it made me go \"wow\". The flavours really work well together.",
