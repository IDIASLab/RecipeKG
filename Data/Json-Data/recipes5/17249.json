We baked them for 5 minutes on the top rack and about 5 to 5 1/2 minutes on the bottom rack (so about 11 minutes at the most). We sat and watched them cool because we could not wait to try them. When we did try them we both said \"mmmm\" at the same time. They are delicious and melt in your mouth. Will definitely be keeping this recipe and make it over and over again!!
