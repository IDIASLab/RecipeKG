I just quickly saut\u00e9ed them in a little butter in a skillet and then added the shrimp at the end. I removed the shrimp from the skillet and then used it to cook the asparagus mixture, so no additional pans to wash.  I didn\u2019t have enough penne on hand, so I used farfalle.  My husband really enjoyed this.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
