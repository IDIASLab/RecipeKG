Their mother who never bakes cookies due to previous experiences with burnt cookies asked for the recipe! She made them and they turned out. She is so proud. They baked MUCH faster than expected even with the convection oven conversion (I have a gas convection range). Watch them carefully and you will be rewarded. Taste wise they're not bad for whole wheat. On my second try today the batter was very wet. I did not even try to form them into balls but made drop cookies. Took only 7 minutes to start burning.",
