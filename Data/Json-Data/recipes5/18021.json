I had two mangos that were starting to get overripe so I took a chance and used them in this recipe instead of the dried mango.  The bars were actually quite good but not very mango-y like I was hoping.  If I make this again I'll try a stronger-tasting fruit...strawberry, pineapple, kiwi?

This is best recipe to make in the Philippines where we have tons of inexpensive dried mangoes there, and I like the way it doesn't give away the taste of mango, instead it tastes like a combination of different fruits and is chewy and addictive!",
