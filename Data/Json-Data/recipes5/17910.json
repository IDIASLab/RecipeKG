I dropped the bread crumbs (Italian) to 1.2 C per pound added in a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce dribbled in a touch of Tobasco Chipotle (it gets hot quickly!) a few passes of Adobo seasoning and about 2 cloves of fresh garlic per pound. I also added a few squeezes of Deli Mustard. The twist I did was I added ALL the ingredients to the beef- including the sauce ingredients. Wrapped with bacon and grilled. They were excellent!! Yes I admit that adding the sauce ingredients was a bit of an accident as I had a child or two continually vying for attention.:) I made up 5 lbs of this using my Kitchen Aid and now I have 4 more meals in the freezer ready to be cooked. Very good!",
