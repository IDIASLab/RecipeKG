I add the lemon juice garlic olive oil and some broth from the chicken to the dish. Along with the salt & pepper I do add the 7 spice to it and then broil for about 5 minutes. It's so yummy!!",

We love the tangy flavor of the chicken & potatoes but 1 whole cup of lemon juice is way too much for our taste. I now only use 1/2 cup. I've made this using either fresh lemon or 100% juice from concentrate and it has turned out great both times. The recipe is tasty as-is but this last time I made it I also added 1/4 tsp oregano & 1/4 tsp thyme to the seasonings and we really loved the additional flavor. This is a keeper & a repeater in our house. Thank you for the great recipe!:)",
