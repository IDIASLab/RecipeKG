I didn't measure the chocolate chips just sprinkled a liberal layer over the base just before the base was done cooking and then I put the pan back in the oven for a couple more minutes. The chocolate melted really quickly and was easy to spread. I did a half-batch for the topping but I just used what I had of the noodles (about 1 cups) and that was enough. If I'd used the full amount called for 2 cups it would have been even more difficult to mix them in. Make sure the topping is hot when you mix in the noodles or it gets REALLY hard to mix and spread over the chocolate. Also these are a little tough to cut so do what I did: Line your pan with foil grease the foil and then when they've cooled lift the bars out peel the foil off and cut them. It's much easier than trying to chop them up in the pan. Thanks Sonya for a different treat!",

The marshmallow peanut butter brown sugar turned into a big blob so I had to add about 1/4 cup butter to smooth it out. Adding the chow mein to this turned it into a complete mess. I must have over cooked it cause now its rock hard and not very pleasant to eat. The crust w/chocolate on the other hand turned out great. Will never be making this again:(",

The difference between the 2 batches was that the second time I made it I melted the sugar and cream together until and all were dissolved and hot before adding the PB mixed it in until melty and then added the- marshmallows last folding in until all melty again and then quickly added chow mien noodles until there was enough to take up the slack and spread before it cooled. This worked a lot better. I think sometimes we take if for granted that others know all the baking methods and when one says do something altogether they do not realize that young bakers do not know what they are looking at and panic at the results they immediately see. I think the recipe is worth a go if you like really rich sweet stuff like kids do. Personally I found that a tiny taste was all I could handle but the grandkids probably would eat the whole dish. It is better eaten the first day or so. Used up my leftover noodles in any case.",

I added 1/2 C chopped up maraschino cherries to the peanut butter layer, as my mom used to do, for some color.\n\nThe key to the top layer is to cook SLOWLY and over low heat: I combined the peanut butter and sugar (in a heavy saucepan, not a bowl over water as that never works for me) and after that had melted I added the light cream and the marshmallows and stirred constantly to keep them melting. And when those had melted I added the noodles and cherries.  It was thick but definitely spreadable.",
