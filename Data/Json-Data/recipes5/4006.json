From there add a teaspoon of paprika along with listed ingredients. Add at least 1 tablespoon of honey more if you like. Add about 1 teaspoon of yellow mustard and instead of almonds add a Tablespoon of poppy seeds. Oh yeah double the curry. I did not add pinapple but i've had chicken salad that way and really liked it. With these changes it will be yummy but it is even better the next day as it says in the recipe. The curry flavor is more pronounced the next day.",

Not sure why I didn't just love it - I love each and every ingredient in it but they just didn't seem to go together well. Maybe it was the dressing. I love curried chicken salad at restaurants too but this wasn't quite the recipe I thought it would be. I even used fresh pineapple to make it extra special. I let it sit overnight and the chicken ended up 'pasty' - the problem got even worse the day after that. Maybe the soy sauce and mayonnaise caused the chicken to break down?? I think I will keep looking.",
