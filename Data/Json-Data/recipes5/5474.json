In fact I used more lemon juice after tasting, because I like it so much. I didn't have any grapes so subbed raisins (after all I was using dried cranberries anyway.) Still very good. So easy to make your own way. Next time I will add a little celery...I added celery seed, but still wanted a bit of celery. Also, I used the Rotisserie chicken made from this site. Thanks for the great recipe!",
