The seasoning was good and I was concerned about the \u201csalt to taste\u201d line I had absolutely no idea how the Anchovy paste would play into the saltiness. Since you can\u2019t taste as you go I really think a recipe at this level deserves a measurement. I would use a 1/2 Teaspoon next time around.  All that said, great job!  We loved them and they will go into our spaghetti & meatball rotation!",
