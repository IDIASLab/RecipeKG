I came across this one and we decided to try it out- it's delicious! I thought the mustard would be overpowering but it's definitely not. A very tasty tangy dish we're South Asian so we like our food flavorful!. We did add more spices and also more onions and green peppers since we like vegetables. We also didn't have the seasoning salt so my mom mixed Mrs. Dash sea salt and several other spices together. Overall my family really enjoyed this dish my dad kept commenting on how good it is. Thank you for sharing we'll definitely make this again!",
