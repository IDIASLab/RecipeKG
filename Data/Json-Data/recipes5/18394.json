I'm going to make them again next week in the size recommended (i made this batch of cookies with more than a tbsp of cookie dough per cookie because i was in somewhat of a hurry).

I increased the cinnamon by fifty percent because a previous reviewer had said they weren't very cinnamony and we thought they were very tasty. I didn't have any superfine sugar so I used granulated and I baked the cookies flat on the tray I don't think they were meant to be baked standing up. Will be making these often!",
