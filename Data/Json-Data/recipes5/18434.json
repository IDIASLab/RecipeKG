But I printed this off a long long time ago and didn't even know until I got into the middle of it that there was a problem. What I got of this was just a very dry \"bowl of crumbles\" as someone put it. I see people referring to them as being like a granola bar. Perhaps this is how granola bars would be made and if I judged it based on that I might feel differently. However there's two issues with that. One is that they are called bar cookies not granola bars. I wasn't looking to make granola bars. Two is that I first noticed a problem when it said to add the vanilla. I looked in the bowl at what was a lot of dry stuff and realized there was no way I could add vanilla to that which is when I realized that something just seemed wrong and came and checked the reviews. OK great. With the advice of some other people I added more applesauce to get some moisture and an egg to help bind it. It at least did stick together instead of crumbling but were still kinda dry and just not much flavor. They were edible and I did eat some. (Maybe I should dump the pic since that isn't really the way the recipe is.)",
