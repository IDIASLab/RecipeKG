The dressing was the real issue with this recipe! The flavor was nice; very fresh and citrusy not too sweet but a good contrast to the grapes with the lemon and honey. The problem was that there was way too much of it and it was so runny that if I had served it as instructed we would have eated the salad out of bowls with spoons! I ended up pouring half of it down the drain then adding several more spoonfuls of mayo to the dressing to thicken it. That helped but as we were running out of time to put dinner on the table it wasn't quite to my satisfaction. Still too runny and the leftovers didn't get eaten. This will need some tweaking.",
