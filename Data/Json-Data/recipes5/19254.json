Instead of baking this I heat up wok in high heat sauteed ginger garlic chili pepper and browned the fish on both sides (whole fish cutted in half) then toss in the rest of the ingredients covered cooked on medium heat until done. Did not add any water but actually thickened sauce with a little cornstarch (mixed first in cold water) had to add a little more sugar since it was a little salty for my taste (fish sauce). overall it tasted great! Hubby loved it. served over rice.",

Covered it with a little of the sauce that is made on Step 4 of this recipe and some basil leaves and then baked it for about 20mins in a 375 degree oven (cooking time would vary depending on your fillet size or fish choice). Served it along with the leftover sauce over Jasmine rice and Broccoli! LOVED IT! GREAT SAUCE! Thank you for the recipe!",

I didn't have any red chilies I used 1/2 fresh jalapeno diced 1/2 fresh habanero diced. Instead of bell pepper/tomatoes I cooked sliced japanese eggplant along with the ginger/cloves. Oh for fish sauce I had only oyster sauce on hand. Lol and for the snapper I used a pound of really fresh filets. I sort of layered the basil (thai basil) into the layers of filets and lightly coated with the oyster sauce - I'll likely add a little water next time to be able to brush it on and distribute a bit better. Okay didn't have peanut oil either so used the last bit of the sesame oil I had (I think it adds a bit more flavor). All in all very similar but done without having to go shop for ingredients. Thank you to Chili Spice for the recipe! Very much enjoyed and have to play with it even more next time:)",
