Yum, yum, yum. It is super simple and uses ingredients most households always have on hand. Although dill pickles are added, the dish it doesn't taste a bit like pickles; however, they definitely make the dish by adding a special something. Warning--this a lick-your-fingers recipe, enjoy!",

Baked 45 minutes at 400 F. The meat broke apart with a fork. My son said I should post a review. My only complaint was that the wasn't enough sauce I will increase that next time.",
