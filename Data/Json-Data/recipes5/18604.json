My recollection is of chunk pineapple rather than crushed so that's what I used and I liked it fine that way. I am not sure I'd like it with crushed. The packets are good cooked in the oven on the barbecue or on the coals of a campfire (when you're out in the woods with no refrigeration you can substitute Spam for the ham too.) I will be interested to try this with fresh sweet potatoes rather than canned I think I will like the firmer texture.",

I will try with the pineapple next time for sure although I am not sure it can get better! It was so easy! I used fresh sweet potatoes because they were on sale and I microwaved them for a few minutes so that I could get my knife through them and I just put a big slab of sweet potato on top of the ham and more brown sugar on top of that. I am sure it would be just as good with the canned ones but they weren't on sale that day (lol) If anyone tries the fresh ones remember to increase cooking time. Since its in the packet the ham was still tender and delicious even with the increased cooking time. I hate to review a recipe and say well I did this and that but I don't think the changes I made mattered much. It will be even quicker and easier the next time when I use the canned sweet potatoes and remember to buy the pineapple. I will definitely be making this again just as it is written. Thank you so much for a great recipe!!",

Everyone ate it but I think it needs some tweaking in my opinion to make it work for us. I made the recipe as it was written and now I know it could use a bit of help. I used a ham steak canned sweet potatoes-drained and crushed pineapple-drained all of which created too much liquid (as well as the other recipe ingredients). Possibly the problem was the ham I used so if I make this again it will be with either leftover ham or deli ham not a ham steak. The ham would need to be cooked first to release the liquid/juices the pineapple would be sliced not crushed and it would have to be a bit less sugar as well (too sweet). I normally love the flavors of this dish and I like the concept as well so I might give it another try with changes.",
