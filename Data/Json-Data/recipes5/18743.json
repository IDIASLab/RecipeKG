I liked the combination of apples and cranberry but the \"crisp\" topping was dry and tasted exactly like cardboard. Gross. I threw out all the leftovers...and there were a lot! It was a VERY dissappointing finale to an otherwise spectacular Thanksgiving meal. I could see all my guests were being polite and choking it down. I finally mumbled something about the topping being dry and tasteless and no-one said anything..they all just stared politely into their bowls. I'll go back to may old tried and true crisp topping recipe. To all of you who want to try this recipe - pick a crisp topping from another recipe on this site. The one on the Maple Apple Crisp (by Crystal) is VERY good!",

I just felt it needed a little extra sugar to please my sweet tooth. I used 1 can of Ocean Spray whole berry cranberry sauce and it was just the right amount. I didn't have whole wheat flour so substituted A.P. and the topping was delicious! Thanks for a great easy fall recipe!",

I found the topping to be fabulous (Evie read the ingredients NOT whole wheat flour whole wheat PASTRY flour that could why yours was not good). I used a big round stoneware dish which was a little bigger than an 8 or nine inch square baking dish because I had about 8 granny smith apples that I wanted to use up. I had two different cranberry sauce leftovers one sweet and one tart with some pineapple in it threw both of them in there and stirred them with the apples added about 1/4 extra cup of oatmeal into the topping mixture since my dish was bigger. Cooked for 50 minutes. Fantastic!!! I would say that any negative reviews on this recipe would be the result of operator error not the fault of the recipe a great and flexible recipe will be my go to recipe now for the topping on any kind of fruit crisp.",
