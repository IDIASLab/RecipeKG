I honestly thought this would need a good deal of salt to taste but it didn't need any only some pepper. I did sub spinach for the kale as the recipe submitter mentioned in the cook's notes just because we prefer it. You could throw in other veggies you have on hand but honestly it didn't need it as far as flavor goes. Excellent recipe!",
