Then with vanilla ice cream and extra chocolate sauce to replace the chocolate ice cream. My favorite is using cookies and cream ice cream with vanilla ice cream instead of chocolate and going lighter on the caramel and chocolate sauce. Whipped cream with a light caramel drizzle is my go to topping. Highly recommend. Easy and very decadent.",
