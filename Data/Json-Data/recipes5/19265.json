I have been wanting to try EGRIVNER's twisted cider but because my grocery store didn't have cinnamon schnapps I defaulted to this recipe instead (the butterscotch schnaps which I LOVE intrigued me). While I like this I too feel that the rum overpowers everything else. I even cut the amount called for by 1/2 cup (I upped the schnapps by 1/2 to compensate). Perhaps spiced rum or a lighter rum would be better???? Regardless this was good and is something that I'd make again if I were craving a \"grown up\" drink. My fiance and I sure enjoyed our cider and s'mores!:-) Thanks for sharing Keri. Danny sure was right!",
