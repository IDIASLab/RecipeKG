Now to be honest it's definitely not chocolatly enough maybe some chocolate chips would make it awesome for all of you chocolate fans but otherwise the cookies were delicious. The are slightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I put them in for the whole 10 minutes and they came out perfect. My husband loves them too!",
