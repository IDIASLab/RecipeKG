I cut the bread into large cubes.  I did also add extra cinnamon (1/4 tsp) and nutmeg (1/8 tsp) as I usually add more to the eggnog I buy at the store.  I liked being able to prep the night before and bake in the morning.  I was worried about the cooking time and did leave it in about 15 minutes longer.  Next time I will take it out closer to the recommended time though as it does continue to cook after removing from oven.",

I will make this every Christmas! Husband who hates mushy french toast LOVED it and everyone wanted recipe! No syrup needed but a squirt of Reddi Whip and a sprinkle of fresh blueberries or strawberries makes this HEAVENLY! I prepared as written with a few minor adjustments: a did prepare night before & sprinkled a little cinnamon on top, I also turned to broil for last 2 minutes of cooking to get a good brown on it and I lightly sprinkled with powered sugar after I took it out to make it look pretty! A must do!",

I couldn't find eggnog so I used the heavy cream and spices, but went a little heavier on the spices.  I also substituted 1 T of maple syrup and 1 T of honey in place of the 2 T of corn syrup.  I think that worked just fine.  Baked it a bit longer than was recommended.",
