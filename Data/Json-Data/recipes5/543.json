The problem is that the vegetables were still undercooked even though I quartered the potatoes and halved the brussel sprouts. Additionally, we prefer caramelized vegetables.  So when I make again, I will quarter brussel sprouts and slice potatoes into 1 inch coins.  The last 10 minutes of cooking, I will probably remove vegetables and finish in a fry pan to caramelize.  Thanks for this quick and tasty recipe.",

Recipe says to \"bake...until chicken is no longer pink...30-35 minutes.\" This will work fine--for chicken, but not for veggies. You want 165\u00b0F for chicken, and that's just fine, especially for dark meat. But Veggies aren't going to be done until the temp is about 170\u00b0F. That takes longer than 35 minutes--about 50 minutes, in fact. \n\nI'll cook this again, but I'm dropping the oven temp to 350\u00b0F and upping the cook time to an hour. (I'll monitor veggie temp to determine doneness, though. If the veggies are done, the chicken will be dandy, too.",

We sprinkled some shredded parmesan cheese over the dish at the end and broiled it on low for a few minutes.  Overall, great dish and will definitely be making it again!",
