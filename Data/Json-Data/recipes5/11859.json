I was most impressed by the crunchiness of the batter! I have a go-to Chic-Fil-A copycat recipe that possibly has a slightly better flavor due to the addition of a TB of powdered sugar in the dry batter but it does not achieve the crust that you'll get with this recipe. I really liked the flavor! I definitely recommend marinating your chicken overnight or as long as you can before cooking.",

I highly recommend you only use one chicken breast to make two sandwiches. If you prefer the bun a Chick-fil-A sandwich comes on, you really need to use brioche buns and be sure to toast it before assembling your sandwich. Do not be afraid to add the cayenne pepper to your breading. it doesn\u2019t really add any heat, just flavor. I also added hot sauce to mayo. At 40 years old, this is the first fried chicken I have ever successfully made. It is super easy if you follow the recipe. Good luck and Enjoy!!",

I followed the entire recipe to a T as far as the marinade, wash and breading but made chicken tenders instead of sandwiches using breast tenderloin filets.  We all loved it!!  I cut back a tad on the cayenne pepper so probably only used about 1 tsp and I made my own buttermilk using the milk combined with lemon juice.  The chicken was super moist and the breading extremely flavorful-it didn't even need salt or pepper afterwards.  I served the chicken fingers will ranch, honey mustard and BBQ dipping sauces.  My BF (who's not a huge fan of chicken) said multiple times during dinner \"this chicken is REALLY good\" and even mentioned it twice the following day so I'm taking that as a good sign:). These will most definitely be made again!\nThe only issue I had was the chicken stuck to the wire deep fry basket and lost some coating when I tried to use tongs to get them out.  We switched to a spatula on the last batch which was more efficient altho that's a user failure!",
