I didn't know what to do, so I just remembered the roasted cashew flour I had in the freezer and everything sort of clicked together. This cake is simple, yummy, healthy, and moist--everything you could want in a modest cake. You don't have to make roasted cashews if you're really short on time, but it does add a unique and subtle flavor.",
