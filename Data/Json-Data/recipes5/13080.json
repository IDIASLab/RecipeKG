Due to the canned bbq pork I can buy being a little overly sweet, I have substituted unsauced cooked pork bbq (12 oz) and double up on the chicken (20 oz). This also allows me to add/use my favorite bbq sauce to my own taste and it turns out wonderful! I also have added carrots and green beans which also makes a nice addition. I like this recipe for the ease it is to make and it definitely tastes better each day as leftovers. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.",

You don't have to use a slow cooker but this is definitely a dish that gets better day to day as the flavors marry. Even still we ate it right away as soon as it heated up (Since nothing in this requires cooking) and was really good.

So I did like a couple of other reviewers and used a rotisserie chicken and pulled BBQ from a local restaurant. I also used their BBQ sauce. I left out the tomatoes because my recipe doesn't include that. I left out the hot sauce but did add a little cumin and the juice of one large lemon which adds a little acidity to balance the sweetness of the cream style corn. My husband LOVED it!!!!",

Since i can't leave well enough alone i used a small can of diced green chilis instead of hot sauce and 3 heaping tablespoons of pickle relish. A cup of brown rice and simmer for 3 hours. A whole meal in itself. This is a recipe you can have fun with. I made a big batch to can the leftovers in pint jars. 45 minutes to process in the canner. I will have wonderful stew all fall.",
