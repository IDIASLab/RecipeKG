I added another Tbsp of butter (total of 1/4 cup) and a dash more of milk, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla - the flavor was so much better and more rich (less pure sugar taste). We really enjoyed this recipe with those tweaks.\nOn another note, DON'T let it boil - the texture becomes grainy (I unwisely thought I could do dishes AND stir occasionaly... but out of sight, out of mind. The flavor was still great, though, and we'll make this again)\nThank for the recipe :)",
