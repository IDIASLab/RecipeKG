                "reviewBody": "These meatballs were great and everyone in the house loved them -- especially the 12yo, who said they were awesome.  For the sauce, I did cut the brown sugar in the glaze in half as recommended by others, and it could have been reduced even more.  With half the recommended amount of brown sugar, the sauce is still very sweet, maybe too sweet.  I'd recommend starting with about a quarter of the recipe amount of brown sugar and working your way up from that.  (Another idea is to make the meatballs without the glaze and use your favorite BBQ sauce instead.)  As for quantity of sauce, you really don't need to smother the meatballs, so I don't think doubling the sauce is really necessary.  For the meatballs themselves, I substituted 2% milk for the evaporated milk to lower fat grams, and it was fine.  I used regular Old-Fashioned Oats rather than quick cooking, and the oats cooked up just fine.",

I used worcestershire sauce in lieu of the liquid smoke per my husband's request, but will probably try it the original way next time. It didn't have much of a \"bbq\" taste, it tasted a lot like my meatloaf. Will also have to double the sauce next time as was previously recommended. I was concerned because the balls were so mushy when I was shaping them, but the cooked texture was perfect. ***UPDATE - I have since made these with the liquid smoke, and doubled the sauce.
