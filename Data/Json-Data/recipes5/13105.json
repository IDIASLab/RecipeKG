I sprinkled some everything bagel seasoning on the top, which was a nice touch. The family liked these a lot, so I will be making them again! Thanks for sharing. :)",

They were alot of work to get thin and large enough to handle a reasonable amount of filling. On a second attempt I used a glass as a rolling pin with a floured surface to work on. This was much better. However I believe I might go with refrigerated dough the next time to make the pockets larger which will hold more filling. Fewer but larger pockets. Or maybe use two bisquits rolled thin per pocket. The filling was absolutely delicious as is. I did use premium canned pulled chicken which happened to be on sale.",
