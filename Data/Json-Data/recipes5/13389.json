        "description": "I wondered if kalua pig could be done in a fraction of the time using the Instant Pot&reg; instead of a slow cooker, and what do you know? It yields succulent, fall-apart, flavorful meat every single time, with almost zero effort. Even with a drier cut like pork loin, which my family prefers as a lower-fat option, it comes out great. This is maybe the simplest recipe I've ever made, and the family raves continuously. Thanks again to Kikukat for the basic idea. Serve with traditional Hawaiian sides or your favorite barbecue sauce.",
