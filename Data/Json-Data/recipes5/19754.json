It needs more ingredients with flavor. Im not the best cook so I am not the person to tweak another persons recipe. I gave it a 3 because it was easy to make and it was easy to understand. Having these ingredients in the house is so common with vegans BUT again it needs something added to make the flavor other then the tofu. I was told all you could taste is that. I think if I try and make this again I will add more Maple Syrup and maybe a bit more Lemon Juice... Again NOT the worse one on this site just needs a bust with another \"BANG\" flavor more of one or a new one added. I will keep reading to see if somebody finds that one perfect add.",
