I added artichoke hearts as I was short one eggplant and I will probably make that change permanent for future times. I also sliced the eggplant more thinly because I needed to get 10 slices from one eggplant. I feel this helped with folding them in half. I also added chicken to the marinara sauce. I was looking for more of a all in one baked dish. In the future I will decrease the marinara sauce as it was too much for me. I found this took longer to cook and prep than estimated but I find most recipes take longer than stated. This will be one I cook again and again.",

This was my first time cooking with eggplants and I was a little concerned about how they would turn out (I've heard they can taste bitter if they're not perfectly ripe) but they were fine and the recipe only brought out he best in their flavor. The only change I made was in regard to the cheese filling: instead of folding over the slices, I layered several eggplant slices on top of the marinara base, then aded the cheese, then added another layer of slices. The slices I had seemed a little too small to fold over. I also used panko bread crumbs. Definitely a keeper recipe.",

I substituted the pepper jack cheese with an Italian blend that has asiago, provolone and mozzarella because I like the softer cheeses in Italian cooking. I also added an egg to the ricotta to make it less dense. The red pepper added a nice spice to this delicious meatless dish. Instead of making little 'taco' filled eggplant slices, I layered them and baked them in my extra large iron skillet. This did take almost 2 hours from beginning to end to make, but it was well worth it.",

I did follow the recipe as written, omitting just the garlic and red pepper flakes, as I used another Allrecipes recipe to make the marinara sauce which in itself had garlic and red pepper flakes.  If I were to prepare this parmesan, again, I would try adding mote pepper jack cheese because it did seem lost in the ricotta cheese.  I would also add a pinch of dried basil and dried oregano to the ricotta to give it more character.  The bread crumbs were good but I think if I used melted butter instead of olive oil, the bread crumbs may feel a boast.  Again, all was not lost, my husband is a fan and the reason for a 4 rating.  While, regardless, I am a fan of Chef John.",
