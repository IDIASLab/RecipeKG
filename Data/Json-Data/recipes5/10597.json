I simmered mine exactly for 3 hours because I wanted it somewhat thin to spread on top of a Tres Leche cake. 3 hours is a long time, but as long as I checked it often and maintained the water level to an inch below the top, it was as easy as it gets. It was so delicious that I had to stop myself from eating it right out of the can! Much better than anything in the store.",
