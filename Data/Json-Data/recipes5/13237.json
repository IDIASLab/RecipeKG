The secret is to use 'dry' scallops and not 'wet' scallops - I won't even mention bay scallops.  Wet scallops have been soaked in phosphates to increase their weight.  If the scallops are bright white when raw, they're wet.  Wet scallops won't brown as well, won't hold breading, they'll shrink while cooking, and their taste is inferior to fresh dry scallops.\n\nRaw dry scallops will have a tan or vanilla color.  In many parts of the country, dry scallops are nowhere to be found.  But, if you can find them, they are very much worth the extra cost per pound!",
