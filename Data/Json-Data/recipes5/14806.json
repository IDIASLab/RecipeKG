Use any keto-friendly granular sweetener that measures like sugar. I prefer the powdered version of Swerve&reg;, since it dissolves better. Adjust cocoa powder and sweetener amounts to suit your tastes. This is quite rich, so you don't need a lot to feel satisfied.",

It was quick and easy. The hardest part was waiting for the cream cheese to soften. I used xylitol as the sweetener and it was great. I took the first bite and felt a rush of satisfaction as relief. It was soooooo good! It was so good in fact, that even though the serving size indicates 1/2 recipe, 1/4 was fulfilling. Therefore, 4 servings instead of 2...YAY! now I can enjoy it 4 times instead of two...or share with 3 other people and be confident that it\u2019s fulfilling. Thank you so much for this recipe...I can now move on with my day and not be a monster.",

I omitted the vanilla extract and added a tablespoon of espresso instant crystals while mixing to make a mocha flavor...yum.  You could experiment with any extract to change it up a bit.
