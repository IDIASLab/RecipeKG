I could only marinate for about an hour, yet can only imagine what its like marinated for a few more!\n(BTW- If you cant \"grill\" it, preheat oven to 350 F. Place a frying pan on med-hi, pour marinade and meat in pan and cook for about 5 minutes each side to \"sear\". Pour remaining marinade and the breast/cutlets in a shallow baking dish & cover with foil. Bake for about 20-30 minutes. So tender AND juicy!)",
