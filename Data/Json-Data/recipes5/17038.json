I also doubled the ketchup and brown sugar except instead of double the ketchup I added 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 KC Masterpeice Honey Smoke BBQ sauce. I left it in the slow cooker on low for about 6 hours so that the weiners and sauce really got to cook together. It was such a hit that I printed copies of the recipe and handed them out to over a dozen guests who asked for it!! The wonderful thing about this recipe is that the base recipe is so simple that \"playing around\" being creative and really experimenting with different ingrediants will make everyone happy who tries this recipe. With a little imagination the possibilities of this recipe are endless! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!",

                "reviewBody": "Overall not a bad recipe. I made this for dinner last night. Very easy to make. I would have left it cooking in the slow cooker longer though maybe even overnight to really let the sauce cook in. Turn it on low heat and leave it for the next night. I too added the extra lb. of ground beef I don't think it would have stayed together otherwise. Then for the sauce you'll need to double the sugar and ketchup. Instead I left the ketchup and sugar as it was and also added 1 can of crushed pineapple and 1 cup of my favorite BBQ sauce. The sauce was great but next time I might add some crushed red pepper or hot sauce to it as well. It is a fantastic base recipe though better than buying frozen meatballs and if you just play with it a bit to get it how you really want it it'll be your favorite meatball recipe.",
