(Did this bloke eat a dictionary?).  Once you have your chops and marinade in the bag, so to speak, take a leaf out of the Japanese itame's cookbook.  Massage it!  Honest, every half hour, give it a gentle rub on both sides, turn it and put it back in the 'fridge.  Should cut your marinating time by four fifths, or give you tons more flavour (sorry) for your bucks.  Always good.  Try it, it really works!  Itame? oh yes, that's a Japanese chef.  ",

The key to making killer pork chops on the grill is not to over cook them. One inch thick chops over medium heat = 7 minutes first side then 5 minutes second. After you've given them a few minutes to rest (7-10 min.) cut the thickest part of one chop and ensure the jucies are clear.",

I did the recipe as it was written with a bit of extra garlic cloves and bone-in pork loin chops. I marinated this overnight and the consistency and flavor were perfect. Since I do not have a grill, I cooked it in a covered frying pan on top of the stove on medium (about 7-8 minutes on each side, uncovered for a minute or so for browning). This recipe will definately be in permanent rotation!",
