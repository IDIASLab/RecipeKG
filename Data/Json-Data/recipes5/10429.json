Made as written except as follows: subbed 3/4 lb. shrimp & 3/4 lb. sea scallops for 1 lb. shrimp subbed seafood stock for water doubled the red curry paste and omitted the rice crackers and sliced basil. We did not remove the seeds from the jalapeno pepper which gave it a welcome hint of heat that was well within our tolerance zone. At this juncture there are 4 other reviews. All but one mention adding ingredients to give more heat to the soup (e.g. doubling the jalapenos or adding cayenne pepper). We would be comfortable with it but I can see where that may disappoint some folks especially with children... taste as you go and only add more if sure you want it hotter. Another very good recipe Chef John.",
