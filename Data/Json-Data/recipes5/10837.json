The Allrecipes printed instructions omit the part of adding the demi glaze back into the pan cream sauce. Luckily Chef John's recipes have amazing accompanying educational videos! When I printed it off a few weeks ago the shallots were also missing from the ingredient list, but it appears that they've been added back. I would suggest watching the wonderful videos first.",

Now I made a mistake but I don't think it made much difference as hubby said one of the best filets he's ever had!  I used a cast iron pan and grilled the steaks with butter.  Laid steaks to rest on warm plate - added the onion (didn't have a shallot) to the pan and browned that up.  Added an airplane size bottle of cognac, lit it on fire, stirred it up, then added the cream, then here is my mistake - I then added the sauce, stirred it all up and then poured over the steaks.  As to whether that is no longer Steak Diane, I don't know but it sure was delicious!",
