I didn't really want two 8\" cakes so baked the recipe in a Bundt pan, sprayed with Baking Spray. I used a yellow cake mix that had pudding in the mix. I increased the amount of chopped pecans to a heaping 3/4 cup. Because of the Bundt pan's narrow bottom (top of cake)the butter/brown sugar mixture was fairly deep. I added 2-oz. bourbon and 2 of the bananas (mashed) to the batter. I sliced the remaining 2 bananas and layered them on the pecan mixture--it was a tight fit but I squeezed them in and only had 3 or 4 banana slices that sat on top of other bananas. I baked it until tester came out clean (I didn't push tester down into bananas)--about 55 minutes.  I let the cake cool about 15 minutes then turned it out. Beautiful, aromatic, cake!  The thicker pecan-butter mixture carmalized perfectly and completely covered the bananas...couldn't see them at all and if they turned dark, there was no way to tell. Tasted great!! I took a photo of the cake and meant to take another THREE days later when there was only one remaining piece, to show how well it lasted, but it got eaten before I had the chance! I liked the texture of the cake...because of the mashed bananas, it was denser than a typical yellow cake. I'll never fret about the extra, too ripe for me to eat, bananas again...thanks, Dana! ",

Followed instructions. Used baking sheet with wax paper placed on top of cake and flipped came out of baking dish perfect no sticking at all. Cake looked and tasted great!
