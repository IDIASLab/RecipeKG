                "reviewBody": "GOOD IDEA, BUT RESCUE THIS RECIPE LIKE SO:  The idea for this recipe was almost certainly gleaned from a bed & breakfast cookbook, the idea being that B&B owners are very busy in the morning, so they do as much prep the night before as they can.  You can still accomplish the convenience, however, without the awful (think wallpaper paste) texture of crock-pot cooked oatmeal, and still avoid having much to do or clean up in the morning.  Here's how:  THE NIGHT BEFORE: toss together the following, and store in an airtight bowl in the fridge: sugar, spices, salt, cut up butter, cut up apples, cranberries (I substituted raisins), and nuts (I used slivered almonds).  IN THE MORNING: put 2 1/2 cups water and the bowl full of sugar/fruit into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Forget all that juice--too sweet!  Notice that the total liquids is significantly reduced from the original recipe, because it's not sitting all night in a crock pot, getting \"pasty\".  When it just begins to boil, add 2 cups regular rolled oats and cook 5 minutes.  Done!  All you had to do in the morning was combine pre-prepared ingredients and cook 5 minutes.  You get delicious gourmet oatmeal without the \"yucky\" texture, and your kitchen is still clean in the morning because you did all the prep and clean-up the night before.  One more tip, for those looking for home-made breakfasts without the chaos and mess (and time!) in the mornings:  You can make pretty much anything the night before and just bake, cook, ",

I made this for my husband's family and they loved it- even the avowed non-oatmeals eaters! Just because I love the spice with apples I added cardamom to the spice mix. I tripled this recipe (I have a very large crockpot) and it held up just fine. The only thing I would do differently when I enlarge the recipe is cut back on the cinnamon because tripling that was way too much. I loved the combination of cranberry and nutmeg. This also reheated very very well-- after leaving my husband's family the oatmeal sat for about and hour and half before I plugged in the crockpot again at my parents and it warmed back up delightfully.",

I did not make this in a slow cooker I didn't have time for that. I actually made this recipe in my rice cooker! I didn't need AS much liquid I used a cup and a half of water and a cup and a half of apple juice. I just kind of guessed. This worked out well for me and the smell of it cooking was amazing. The amount of sugar and spice was perfect and the fruit cooking along with the oatmeal gave it such amazing flavor. I loved that I could just throw everything together and let it go. Even though I didn't cook it in a crockpot I think I got the best of the recipe without all the gumminess or burned oatmeal. I think cooking it in my rice cooker could use a little playing around with as far as the liquids go but for me it was still a winner. Thanks for this great recipe--it's a keeper!",
