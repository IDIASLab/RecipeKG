The second time, I cut out the mustard, added W.Sauce,fresh basil,and 3 cloves of minced garlic. This addition makes the marinade heavenly and its now a go to for me when grilling steaks. I also would never use vegetable oil in a marinade as its too thick, olive oil always works best in meat marinades and cut it way down to like 1/4 of a cup.",

Followed the recipe exactly, forked the *** out of my inside round roast and let it marinate for 6-8 hours this morning. Took it out of the marinade, rubbed all over with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper and seared it. Braised in the oven at low heat sitting in beef broth. SUPER YUMMY! Roast was moist and very tender and forked apart easily, and the outside pieces had a WONDERFUL flavour. Gravy was superb (though again, I didn't cook it in the marinade.) Hubby says it's the best roast I've ever made! Definitely a repeat!",
