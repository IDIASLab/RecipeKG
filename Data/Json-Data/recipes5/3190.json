The teacher asked for the recipe.I was careful to follow the recipe exactly.I was concerned that one reviewer had lumps from the cream cheese in her dip. To avoid lumps I took the cream cheese out of the refrigerator a few hours before I used it and let it come to room temperature. Then I put it in the microwave for about 40-seconds to make sure it was soft. Then I stirred it well and then added the condensed milk and stirred it well. As a matter of fact I used a mixer. In the morning I did not have lumps nor did it separate and look like cottage cheese. It was perfect. I stirred it well one more time to make sure. I will no longer purchase fruit dip from the store again. Yum!!!",
