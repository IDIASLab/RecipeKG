I used Texas Pete Buffalo Style Chicken Wing Sauce, 1/3 less-fat cream cheese (aka Neufchatel), and 1 lb. of fresh chicken that was boiled for 20 minutes (or until done) and then shredded. However, to avoid the strange \"orange sherbert\" color of the dip, I layered the ingredients in a 8\"x11\" baking dish as follows:  Mix together the softened cream cheese and ranch dressing and spread evenly in the bottom of the dish.  Then mix together the shredded chicken and wing sauce (about 2/3 bottle)and layer on top of the cream cheese mixture.  Sprinkle just a small amount of shredded cheese (I used Colby/Jack) over the top.  Bake at 350 for about 20-25 minutes or until dip is heated through and cheese is melted.  I just think people tend to shy away from the dip when it's all mixed together because of the strange color.  It's more recognizable (retains a brighter red color) when it's layered and gets gobbled up faster!",

When I mixed the the cream cheese and bleu cheese together I added more hotsauce for more of a kick.  Baked in an 8x8 pan, 350 for 20 minutes.  Dip was gone in minutes!   will make 100 more times!!",

My changes (okay, I made quite a few): use 1/2 cup Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce and 1/2 cup Red Hot, 1/2 cup of Ranch dressing and 1/2 cup Blue Cheese dressing, and put almost all of the cheese in the dip and just sprinkle some on top.  Oh yeah, and we used fresh chicken shredded in the food processor as someone suggested.  And we didn't like the crock pot method - it made the dip get dried out pretty quickly.  We just cooked it on the stove and put it into a serving dish (we did end up puting in the microwave a few times, but that was okay).  This is great because the recipe itself is very low carbs and you can use low fat cream cheese, dressing, and cheese and you don't experience all that much guilt... especially when served with celery sticks (although those Fritos scoops are fabulous!)

I read the reviews before making it and like many others I made a few modifications that I think helped make the recipe better.  I used 1 lb of skinless chicken breasts which I cleaned, sliced into strips and par boiled for 15 minutes, drained, and cooled for a few minutes.  When the chicken is cool it will be very easy to shred with your fingers.  I used a large skillet where I placed 1 Cup of Frank\u2019s Red hot which is what is used in Buffalo, NY at the Anchor Bar to make real Buffalo chicken wings.  I also added a \u00bd stick of butter which is also a very common ingredient in the preparation of Buffalo chicken wings.  While the chicken and Frank\u2019s is warming slowly, I mixed one cup of Blue cheese dressing and the cream cheese until smooth and placed it into the refrigerator until I was ready to make the dip. After the chicken and Frank\u2019s were good and warm I placed this into a plastic container for later use as well.  This gets everything ready for the next day or for later in the day to just place it together and warm in the oven.  When I was ready for the dip I pre-heated the oven to 350 placed the blue cheese mixture into the bottom of a 7x11\u201d baking pan and layered the chicken onto the top of the blue cheese.  I topped the whole thing with a small amount of shredded mozzarella / provolone cheese and po",
