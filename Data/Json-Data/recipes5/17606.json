First of all I checked the temp of the meat at 2 hours (the low end of cooking time) and it was well over 160.  Consequently it was all dried out.  The temp needs to be checked early and often. Also, if you like the taste of sauerkraut leave out the apples, onions and sugar.  I think these modifications gave it an odd flavor, mellowed the tang too much, in my opinion.",
