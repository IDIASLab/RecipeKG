But the toppiing is a keeper... I'll never make \"naked\" pumpkin pie again!! I also did find that I had to cook it 10 minutes past the suggested time, and maybe could have stood 5 minutes more.***Note, we ate this pie in the evening, after it had cooled but before chilled. All I can say was it was WAY better then next day cold. The flavors really came together and the texture was awesome!!! I'm making 2 for thanksgiving!!!",

This topping is like a streusel and we really like it...and fancy that! What I did differently is I gave the G.C. Crust an eggwhite wash and pre-baked it in the 425 degree oven for 5 minutes let it cool some before adding the pumpkin mixture. Used the remainder of the egg white the called for egg in the mixture. Used pecans rather than walnuts (not a walnut fan either). Other than that I stuck to the recipe to a \"T\". Will be making this one again and rotate it with my \"Pumpkin Something Crunch\" recipe. This recipe is better when you want your pie to look and serve like a pie. froze some pieces and they thawed well(after 2 weeks) but lost a bit of the crunch. Taste was still wonderful.",
