I put the sauerkraut in my large crockpot, sauteed the bacon and onion and then added it with the sugar and apple.  I did not use caraway.  I browned some country ribs and placed them on top along with several smoked sausage (I like brats, but, only had the smoked sausage).  I let it slow cook all day.  I made mashed Yukon Gold potatoes to go along with the meal.  The family raved about it!  Thanks for the recipe!",
