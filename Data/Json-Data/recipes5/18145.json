How was I supposed to know not to touch the pepper with my hands?  Apparently (now that I have researched the Habenero peppers online) you are not supposed to touch these peppers with your bare hands (i.e., you are supposed to wear rubber gloves) and you must wash the cutting board and knives to prevent the spreading of this capsaicin in the pepper which can burn your skin upon contact. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE RECIPE DIRECTIONS!!  Some sort of 'handling instructions or warning' and what to do if you happen to come into contact with this capsaicin.\r\n\r\nI am so disappointed, I am ready to dump the dish and start something else for dinner.",

I may try again but grill instead of broil. Update to my first review. I am now giving this 5 stars. I made some mistakes the first time I made this so when its prepared correct it's delicious. The one thing I keep forgetting to do is hold out part of the marinade to pour over after cooking but even without it the flavor is great. We also grilled it this time instead of broiling and it is definitely better cooked on the grill.",

I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and baked at 475 for about 40 minutes turning once and left the marinade in the pan so the chicken wouldn't stick to the bottom. The only thing is I didn't think it was spicy enough with the one habanero for it to be true spicy jerk. Next time I'll use to peppers instead of the one.

I used onion powder and dried thyme because it was easy and went for a whole habenero. Now I like spicy but habeneros scare me. I de-seed completely (WITH GLOVES!) and left a little of the menbrane. It was just spicy enough and my husband who likes super spicy was fulfilled with the reserve sauce to kick up the heat. Our seven year old devoured it- spicy side sauce and all. The sweet is fairly subtle and the spice creeps up slowly. Very Good. We will make this a regular. Thank you.",
