I let it cool while I prepared the rest and then scooped out the seeds and added the rest to the skillet. I also left the peel on the apple and added a little bit of sage along with the oregano. This is a fantastic recipe using seasonal ingredients. Yum!",

I toasted the almonds and put some brown sugar on them and used a fabulous white cheese on top called \"Dubliner\" that I got at Sams Club. Surprisingly DELISH!",
