I gave four stars because the cereal was confusing. First of all I didn't have tahini so I used peanut butter. I don't use eggs so I used egg replacer. A bit extra almond paste (7 oz tube total) seemed to make up the extra stickiness. I don't generally have orange juice around the house so I used cider. I hadn't heard the bit about using a multigrain cereal so I did use a flake. Luckily it was a very robust whole grain flake so it was fine. Next time is try oats but otherwise I'm incredibly pleased. They came out slightly crisp on the edges and chewy in the middle. They didn't spread too much (though I did use cold butter let stand mixer do the work and I refrigerated dough afterwards. MOST IMPORTANTLY they have that almond paste texture which I LOVE. I will try again next time I have extra tahini.",
