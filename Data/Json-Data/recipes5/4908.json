My only substitutions were adding lemon peel from the fresh lemon and since I didn't have tuna in olive oil I used two packets of low-sodium tuna 1 Tbsp Olive Oil. I also went with the author's suggestion of adding drained chopped artichoke hearts. Since my husband is on Phase 1 of South Beach we served this over lettuce and it made a perfect light dinner on a hot summer night. The lemon gives the perfect amount of brightness and the red onion that added zing! Thank you so much for a fabulous recipe!!!",

Added a full 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (3 lemons). Added 1 c. chopped artichoke hearts (they were oil packed and even drained added enough oil to my tuna canned in water to achieve moistness and good flavor). Don't eat this salad until it has melded for a day. Absolutely unbelievably bright fresh satisfying...all who tried consumed huge quantities. Excellent to use for stuffing in a vine ripened tomato. I would not delete any of the ingredient...especially the fresh parsley and in the full amount called for. This particular combination of zingy red onion salty black olives (used kalamata for a total tuscan treat) fresh zesty parsley zippy fresh lemons robust chickpeas and good old tuna absolutely LOVE each other. The feta is just the crown jewel. GO Krissy G!",
