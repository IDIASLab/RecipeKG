There is a subtle difference between this and one that uses more oil and boils a syrup first, but it's not a 'step down' kind of difference. This one won't 'chunk up' because of that and seems a little drier, but has so much flavor! I was skeptical that the applesauce would produce a crisp granola, but it worked! Very crisp. Must be the flour that helps it along. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 ground flax to make up for the spelt flour I didn't have. I also left out the maple syrup I didn't have and this was plenty sweet. I added in almonds for the pecans, and dried blueberries for the apricots(topped with a few fresh for the photo). Fyi, this makes about 4 cups. Thank you so much for the recipe. It will be made often in this kitchen.",

I made it with the spelt flour, cut the amount of brown sugar in half, subbed raisins for apricots and almonds for half of the pecans. I also used molassas instead of some of the maple syrup. It was tasty, but needed something else. I added a little salt and will use less flour next time, as well as add some vanilla. Thanks for a good base recipe!",
