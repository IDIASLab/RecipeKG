It has a tangy zip, from the excellent addition of tomatoes, and because it doesn't call for adding a mess of canned and powdered soup mixes, the rich taste of the meat really shines through. Really, these are fantastic! I browned my patties in a skillet before baking so that I could use the hearty drippings to make the sauce with. Just sauteeing a large onion and some diced mushrooms in the meat drippings, then adding water, cornstarch and some beef stock made the absolutely perfect complimentary sauce for these \"steaks\", and I look forward to making this again! It's nice to find recipes that don't require a bunch of processed and pre-packaged ingredients in them, too... canned breadcrumbs, powdered soup, etc.? That's not my idea of homestyle cooking! Nothing tastes better than healthy, from-scratch homemade food, and this recipe is a nice testimony to that!",
