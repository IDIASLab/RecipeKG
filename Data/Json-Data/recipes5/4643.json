Watch carefully if you get a nice golden top the edges may burn. The directions didn't say anything about greasing the pan so I didn't... but probably should have. I didn't even think about it until it was too late and the cheesecake was in the oven. I'd make this again. I probably wouldn't serve this for company until I ironed out the issues of presentation and timing. Also the cheesecake was only 3/4\" high - so doubling the recipe may give it a little more volume.",

I'd recommend a layer of parchment paper since the bay leaves easily move and if any part of the cheese cake is brown it sticks. The taste was okay; even with half the bay leaves (mine are really strong) their flavor overwhelmed the delicate orange and honey flavors which had made the batter taste so promising. Far from being a disaster but not a repeat recipe for me.",

I don't know if it would have cooked properly if the recipe had been doubled but that might be an option. 15 bay leaves make its presentation very interesting to the eye but they add way too strong a flavor - overpowering in my opinion. If pre-slicing for entertaining cut your slices SMALL or no one will finish theirs! It stuck like Elmer's Glue to my springform pan but the paring knife helped and it released with some gentle scraping effort... so looks pretty good (I'll add a photo since there isn't one presently). My daughter needed an \"Ancient Roman Dessert\" for a Latin Classical League (high school) party and this is the only one that I could find on Allrecipes.com. Sure hope the teenagers eat it...and if they accidently eat a bay leaf they won't get a shock because the entire dessert tastes like one anyway!:) Can anyone upload another \"Ancient Roman Dessert\" to give readers more options to choose from?",
