This flavor profile will not mix well when tossed in traditional buffalo wing sauce and bleu cheese after cooking, however.  I'd recommend a more asian dipping sauce.  We also placed the wings on a broiler pan @ 410 degrees to drain as we like our wings super crispy and this did the trick without frying.",

I've made it two times now, substituted Madeira for the sherry the second time with equally good results. \n\nI just add the marinade and frozen wings to a big bowl, toss and then thaw the wings in the marinade in the fridge overnight. They came out perfectly juicy and flavourful both times. Officially making this my go to recipe for asian style marinated wings. Also love that all the ingredients are things I usually keep on hand.",
