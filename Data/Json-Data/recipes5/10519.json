                "reviewBody": "We search for new ways to incorporate kale into our meal planning because of its super nutritional benefits. Thought about skipping over this recipe since we re not big fans of most vinaigrette dressings especially those loaded in oil. But a closer look indicated a moderate amount being used (1/3 cup olive oil). The orange flavor of this dressing really shines through and very tasty. Next time I will experiment using the exact same salad dressing ingredients except adding Greek low-fat yogurt and either significantly reducing the olive oil or eliminating it entirely. First try Chef John s vinaigrette and then subsequently make a creamy dressing if that is your pleasure. There were no persimmons available so we subbed dried apricots. We cut the kale in ribbons as directed but don t believe this helps to mellow it out. Much easier to eat bite size pieces than wrestle with something like long green slippery ribbons. Tried this salad right after making it and would have rated it 4. After letting it rest in fridge for about 4 hours kale mellowed out a bit more and the flavors melded together nicely. If not eating this salad immediately soak the apple matchsticks in a solution of lemon juice/water to impede browning. This is a keeper.",

I didn't have orange juice or orange zest so I substituted grapefruit juice and lemon juice (instead of the zest). I also used almonds instead of the pistachios but next time I would used chopped pistachios I think they would go well with the flavors. I also let the salad sit without the apples for 5 hours. The kale softened and the flavors deepened. I added the apple at the end. Would be a great dinner salad if you added some grilled chicken preferably marinated with similar Middle Eastern or Indian flavors.",
