The cake like dough was really good. However when I baked it and tried it it was dry and very bland. So then I added the marshmallow and did as the recipe called for. Then tasted it and wasn't impressed at all. To enjoy this recipe I tried several different things as I was determined not to waste my time and effort in making this cause overall it was good but just needed alot of sprucing up. I chopped pecans I covered the marshmallow with some more chocolate dough and baked still to not avail. In my last attempt which was the winner was i took some choc. chips and shortening and melted it. Threw the marshmallows out altogether and just used the chopped pecans and drizzled chocolate over then to spruce it up a little more I put powdered sugar over the top. Long story short its a good starting off point but it definitely needs more creative touch. Its not necessarily a cookie either its more of a cake like treat. I dont know if I will make again.",

The cookie was bland at best. It had a very plain chocolate flavor and the recommended frosting didn't add a new note. Worse the marshmallows didn't spread or flatten; they just sit on top and add a lot of height to the cookie - also making it very difficult to frost. On the plus side the texture of the cookie is lovely. It's soft and cake-like (if you read the directions step 3 states this) nice and fluffy. Some depth to the flavor would make this a great recipe.",

It was almost a caramel color. I LOVE the idea for these cookies using the marshmallow and then fudge frosting on the top so I wanted to love them but they just didn't cut it.",
