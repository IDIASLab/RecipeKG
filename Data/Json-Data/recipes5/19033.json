Also added a pinch of soda since all chocolate chip cookie dough recipes have soda and it tasted like the real thing. It was very soft but I had no problem rolling into balls. I used them to bake into the cupcake recipe on this site (long name like Choc. Chip Cookie Dough Cupcake...) because the dough mixture in that recipe features eggs and since it is not supposed to bake all the way through I used this one instead as it does not feature the use of raw eggs. Absolutely perfect.",

It's vanilla ice cream with a mix-in of these round small bits of heaven in the form of chocolate chip cookie dough yumminess! THIS is what this recipe provides. As a surprise for our recently Jr. High graduate son's party I made this recipe. The ONLY changes I made for us is NO WALNUTS (to ME AKA I call them 'dirt clods' lol) and I added the whole two cup bag of chocolate chips. This provided the mix to go further for the party and also a guaranteed chip in every cluster! Rather than the messiness of forming the 'balls' of dough by hand I used two small measuring spoons and scooped up the dough with one and dropped little piles of the soft dough onto two cookie sheets. I froze them in the freezer for only 30 mins and then spatula'ed them into a ziploc bag and back into the freezer until dessert time. I got rave rave reviews with this recipe. You will too. On the make-your-own-sundae bar our guests sprinkled the dough bits on top of scooped vanilla ice cream and drizzled hot fudge and topped everything with Cool Whip in a can spray. You won't regret this one people.:)",

I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and a whole bag of normal sized chocolate chips. I like it better when there is chocolate in every bite. I made them a very decent size, yet they made more than expected, which was a plus! Also, I put them into the freezer for about an hour and then dipped some of them in chocolate. They were great and looked amazing! If you dip them in chocolate or not, they still look and taste fine. Also, I found that in the freezer it froze a little too much, so instead I put them in a container and placed them in the coldest part of the fridge. They are still great, and I reccomend eating them directly from the fridge/freezer.",
