You can make the marinade and cook the loin immediately or you can let the pork soak overnight. Either way, I promise this will be the best pork tenderloin you've ever had. It may seem like a lot of ingredients, but it is a very simple recipe and well worth the effort.",

I covected the tenderloin on \"roast\" at 325 for 1 hour and fifteen minutes and it was well above 160. I was worried because it was overcooked, but it was still excellent and very tender. Next time, I will check it at one hour -there WILL be a next time. The sauce was a little salty, but the meat was not. The pepper flakes give it a kick that jumps this from a four star to a five.
