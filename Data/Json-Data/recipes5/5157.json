Unfortunately I threw this in the oven and went out of the kitchen to do some other things so I didn't catch that it was over cooking until the timer went off. I would start checking this at 50 minutes. I do use an oven thermometer so it wasn't the temp. but it did burn a bit on the edges and the sides. The lemon doesn't really come through in the flavor. Little bit sad over this one, its not a cheap recipe to make with all the butter and poppy seed filling,",
