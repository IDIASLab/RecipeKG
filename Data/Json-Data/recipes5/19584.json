I seasoned the chicken breasts with a little salt pepper and garlic powder. I added 1 clove of fresh minced garlic to the green pepper mix. I also used curry PASTE versus powder. I used 1 tbsp because I love curry but less would be good also especially if you don't like a lot of spice. Paste adds a lot of flavor. Curry paste can be found at most grocery stores in the ethnic food section or for a lot less money at an Asian market if you have one nearby.",
