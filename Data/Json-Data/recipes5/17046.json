I halved the recipe as 7 portions was too much food.\nIn the meatball portion of the recipe, I didn't have soy sauce, so I used worcestershire sauce instead.  The meatballs came out perfectly, nice and soft, and I cooked them in the oven as explained, but before I covered the meatballs with the sauce, I flipped them over, so they could be cooked evenly on both sides.  Next time I would lower the temperature 25 degrees, as I used a pyrex pan.\n\nFor the sauce, instead of cranberries, I used 3/4 cup of lingonberries and 1/4 cup of blueberry preserves.  I used garlic BBQ sauce and prange juice instead of lemon juice.  Once the sauce simmered and then cooked on the actual meatballs, the flavours blended perfectly.  I would definitely make again and perhaps attempt a version in the crockpot :)",

I put in about half the required barbeque sauce for added sweetness. I've had a few parties and serviced this and everyone just loves them - throughout the year not just the holidays! FABULOUS! EDIT Just wanted to add to this review... I now make these pretty often... in a pinch for time i'll purchase pre-made meatballs and then cook those in the sauce... HUGE time saver and still completely delicious every time!! Great quick meal to make after work too!",
