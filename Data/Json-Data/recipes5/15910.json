Also, I used the Allrecipes top-rated recipe for taco seasoning rather than a packet from the store.",

                "reviewBody": "Great! I made a double recipe. I only had 1 packet of taco mix so I used some fresh garlic and individual spices for the second pack of taco mix. To make it very low fat I just used olive oil spray initially and used fat free sour cream and fat free shredded cheddar. I didn't mix the cheese and sour cream in but instead served this on soft tortillas spread each tortilla with sour cream first then topped the mixture with shredded cheese and folded/rolled burrito-style. My husband loved it and said he'd be glad to eat it plain also--no tortilla and no sour cream and cheese either. I liked that it was low salt and we could make it very low fat. I added a diced yellow pepper. Like another reviewed I had to add extra water and extra time to the quinoa to get it to steam up fluffy. We will make this regularly! It was tasty and a nice choice for healthy \"comfort food \" and it was pretty quick and inexpensive with mostly pantry staples on hand.",
