I made it close to the recipe as stated, but subbing somewhat with what I had on hand (smaller 1 1/2 lb roast but keeping other ingredients about the same, beef bouillon instead of broth, dried herbs, and the oven at 325 for a bit over two hours).   I served it over rough-mashed parmesan potatoes.  It turned out great and I will definitely make it again.  SO says it is one of his favorite new recipes - tender meat with deep flavor!  It's a great use for a somewhat cheaper cut of meat and reheats well, too.  And it is adaptable to additions or substitutions, making it a 'go to' recipe at our house!",
