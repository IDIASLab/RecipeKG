The herbs and mustard provide a nice bunch of flavor, combined with the tangy lemon and sweet cherry tomatoes. I served this with rice and sauteed green beans. Start checking the chicken before 30 mins, as mine was done around 22-23 minutes.  Pound the chicken to an even thickness of about 3/4\" before starting. This will go into my regular rotation and is impressive enough to serve to guests!",

No grain mustard so I used dijon. I also added a touch of lemon juice to the mustard sauce. Here's a shortcut: marinated the chicken breasts in a lemon-garlic vinaigrette and grilled them ahead of time.\nServed it with garlic mashed potatoes. My husband loved it and even took a photo to send to his BFF to brag. LOL! The kids were not fans of the Gruyere but it would be very easy to leave it off some of the chicken in future.",
