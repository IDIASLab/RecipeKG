My fudge turned out very grainy and dry and crumbly probably from mixing too much but even though I had sifted the powdered sugar I had a hard time getting all the lumps dissolved. The fudge was also VERY sweet even too sweet for some of my sweet tooth kids but we still ate the whole batch. I might make it again trying a little less sugar next time. Thanks",

After making it to a T and seeing what unfolded as the result I went back and saw another person mentioning it was gritty. And yes. This recipe is gritty. But more so very buttery. It had the flavor of maple but butter too with the crunch of the walnut pieces. I think and don't quote me on this. I'm not a fudge expert maker. But I feel there is to much butter. While the recipe set up in the beginning and after being in the frig for 4 hours it was still soft and slightly crumbly when cutting. 15 minutes doesn't do this recipe justice. Before adding in your walnuts please make sure you get all the sugar lumps that it creates out of the mixture before adding. I know I sifted my powdered sugar very well and it came out very lumpy. I think getting the lumps out as it was cooling and mixing around trying walnuts was just a little understaking. The only thing positive was that this recipe was sweet and had nice flavor if you can get past the overwhelming butter taste. Sorry.",
