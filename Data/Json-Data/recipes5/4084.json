Like Candice, I wanted the dish to be a little saucy so it could be served over rice.  I used about 3/4 can of coconut milk.  Also, I read the reviews which state that the cauliflower takes too long to cook.  So while I was preparing the rest of the dish, I steamed the cauliflower in a separate pot.  Then I added the steamed cauliflower to the dish to cut down on the cook time.  Don't steam too much or the cauliflower will become mushy after cooking it with the rest of the dish.",

I used a nonstick pot. I'm perplexed. I was determined to make it work so I added a little water and a tad more oil just to keep it from burning. Needless to say it didn't come out crunchy:( I only cooked mine for the time given and I liked the crunchier contrast of the cauliflower. I left out the peppers which was a mistake in my opinion I should have used at least 1/2 of one since I was only cooking for four people. However in the end of this culinary fiasco this tasted good. Therefor I give it four stars. I may try it again tomorrow and see if I can figure it out.",

                "reviewBody": "I LOVE this recipe. However it has taken me a few tries to figure out how to best orchestrate cooking all of the elements without scorching/turning things to mush/etc. The following works well for me: Cover the potatoes and cook them in some vegetable oil until they are pierceable but not fully done stirring occasionally (takes around 10 minutes for me but I usually double the recipe). Take them off the heat THEN proceed with the recipe as written adding the potatoes back in at the same time as the cauliflower. Also I definitely recommend adding a bit of water to the spice mixture to form a paste--it prevents scorching so you don't end up with a nondescript \"burnt Indian spice\" flavor but rather the fantastic combination of spices given in the recipe. Finally I usually add a total of about a 1/2 cup of water while the whole dish is cooking spread out over the full cooking time. You might get by without it but it helps things to soften a little more quickly. The dish never comes out crunchy for me but I honestly don't mind at all. Really a great (and super cheap if you buy bulk spices!) recipe.",
