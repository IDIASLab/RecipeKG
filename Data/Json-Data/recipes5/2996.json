I mixed it all together threw in almost a whole cucumber chopped because I was craving the crunch and water content then tasted it. Nothing. I expect it will come together nicely overnight in the fridge but just to be on the safe side I sprinkled it very generously with a \"black olive red pepper & mint\" salad seasoning combo that I have in my pantry. Tasted it again and it rocked. Can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow. Really a very lovely combination of things. It will probably become a favourite pasta salad of mine.",
