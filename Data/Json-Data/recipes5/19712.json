There is no real sauce so to speak. The natural juices mingled with the soda/barbecue sauce concoction and watered it down. However when I made them a second time I boiled the daylights out of the sauce in a saucepan for about 15-20 minutes (or so - just watch for it to thicken a bit) until it thickened. I then brushed some onto the chops and reserved the rest to pour on at the dinner table (I stuck it in a gravy boat and let my hubby and the kids pour on to their hearts' desire). Everyone agreed that doing it this was much better the chops were more flavorful and the sauce is KILLER! Thanks for a good starting point. Will definitely make this again the amended way.:-)",
