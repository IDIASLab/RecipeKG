My family liked it better with the Texas Toast but I think that is due to other tweaks. I added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and was very liberal with the spices. I cooked the recommended spices into the mushroom and leek mixture. And then added  half teaspoon of the thyme and parsley to the egg mixture. All in all, that went over well. I used white button mushrooms and baby Bellas because that is what the supermarket had.  And I cooked it all in one big pan. This is our new New Year's Day brunch tradition!",
