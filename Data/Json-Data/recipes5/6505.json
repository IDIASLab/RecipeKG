Farro is an ancient Mediterranean grain, so I wanted to merge it with a Greek-style salad that's perfect for summertime. This is great served with grilled lamb or chicken. Add black olives or fresh herbs to your liking!",

I omitted the tomato added a carrot and a stalk of celery finely diced used the tops of 2 green onions for the red onion. I used vegetable broth for simmering it took 45 minutes for the farro to burst open. Thanks for a great recipe. The second time I made the salad I used PC Blue Menu Italian Farro which only took 20 minutes to burst open the box is 1 1/2 cups of farro as well which makes it easy for measuring too.",

My garden cucumbers and tomatoes went into it and I followed the recipe as shown. I love it-very tasty and keeps well in the fridge for a few days! Make it!",
