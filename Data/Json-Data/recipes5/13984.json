I used canned diced tomatoes canned beans bottled lemon juice and ground cumin instead of seeds which made it so easy. I finished it up in the crock-pot and served it to my church family. They loved it! To make peeling the squash a little easier: cut it in half zap it in the microwave for a couple of minutes. After it cools cut into lengthwise pieces and use the vegetable peeler. It will be a little softer.",
