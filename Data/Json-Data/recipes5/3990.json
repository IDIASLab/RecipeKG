Substitute 6 oz. canned sliced mushrooms drained and rinsed. Drain and rinse canned artichoke hearts and cut into pieces (or use hearts of palm which have a milder more lemony flavor.) Slice the bacon strips into 1-inch pieces. Keep everything in separate prep bowls and set aside. (3) Cook sauce exactly as directed to keep it creamy. Once the last pat of butter is mixed in immediately remove the pan from heat and keep warm (or place on a very low heat and stir occasionally.) Do not keep or reheat on medium or high heat as the cream sauce will separate and become greasy. (4) Slice the raw chicken breasts with the grain into inch strips. Cook in one layer in a non-stick pan on medium heat with 1 Tbs. olive oil until the edges are cooked; then flip the strips and cook for about 2 more minutes until no longer pink and cooked through. Immediately remove from heat place in a bowl and cover with foil to keep the strips warm and tender do not leave them on the burner as overcooking will make the chicken tough and rubbery. (5) While the pasta cooks cook bacon a bit over medium heat; add mushrooms and cook 3-5 minutes; add the artichokes or hearts of palm last heating through about 2 minutes to preserve their soft texture and keep them from becoming mushy. (6) Return chicken strips to the skillet and continue as directed.",

It has so many delicious ingredients and the final product after significant recipe alteration is yummy but let me start by saying no way is this recipe ready after 30 minutes. No. Way. Impossible. Second the recipe does not specify whether the bacon should be cooked when you put it in or raw. I opted for mostly cooked in my microwave before I dumped it in the pan-- thank goodness or either it would have been raw or everything else would be toast. Third if you make it as the recipe describes it will be ridiculously greasy. I used about half of the butter and one less T of cream and drained and wiped out the pan not only after cooking the chicken but after cooking the mushroom mixture as well but it was STILL greasy! I can only imagine what it would have been like. After all that it was good much like the restaurant recipe I think it's trying to replicate (despite the story about the old lady)... It wasn't any harder to make than it sounded but I could tell it was not a half-hour recipe. Well... I hope that this long recipe review was helpful. The end product was good but the recipe needs major revisions for it to be tasty and/or match the cooking time.",

I followed the recipe verbatim and it was one of the BEST things I have ever tasted. And my dinner guests agreed. I salivate just thinking of it.  It is well worth the effort and I did everything in the early afternoon except boiling the farfalle. So when my guests arrived I just added the chicken to the mushrooms, etc. and tossed it until it warmed up.  Reheated the lemon butter sauce.  and boiled the noodles.  Served it with a light, leafy salad with italian dressing and a hot loaf of french bread.  It doesn't get better than this in any ***** restaurant. Thank you for sharing it with us.  And may the wonderful italian woman rest in peace knowing she left a delicious legacy.",

I followed the recipe exactly and by the time the pasta and chicken was done the sauce had seperated and you are left with alot of butter un-incorperated with the cream.It's much easier to keep the chicken warm then the sauce.The longer the sauce sits the more it breaks down.You can add alot of things to the final dish ie. tomatoes,parmesan cheese or what ever you like.",

I cooked the chicken the night before and purchased chicken tenders to make it easier for prep. I sliced the chicken and bagged it. I cooked the bacon after that and bagged it with paper towels to keep it crisp and reserved some bacon grease for the following day. The next day I cooked the sauce in one pot and cooked the remaining ingredients together and added some bacon grease to the mixture for a little more flavor. I combined the ingredients with the chicken until the chicken was heated through. Before I put the chicken in a chafing dish I added the sauce to the mixture and tossed. It was absolutely delicious! I think if I made it again I would try using procuitto. But this is fabulous! A And GREAT for a buffet!",

I mixed 1/4 cup of wine and half 1/4 cup of lemon juice and let reduce. Then I melted a half stick of butter in the sauce and stirred until it melt completely. Then I added 1 cup of heavy cream and a bunch of fresh parsley. I read on another site a trick to keep the sauce from separating is to keep it on low heat and whisk for a long time after adding cream (6-8 min).It came out perfect. Also the dish tastes great with some sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top.",

I used several lemons because we all love the flavor and subbed with fat free half and half which worked out very well. Rigatoni with the ridges held the sauce nicely. Thank you so much for a great Sunday evening dinner!",
