I was expecting it to be similar to Cream of Mushroom Soup, but it was more of a flavorful soup than a creamy, rich one. True, it was rich even though we used Skim Milk and Light Sour Cream. But it was fabulous nonethless! I can understand why some previous reviewers opted to lessen the lemon juice and dill. However, I think they all added to the flavor in a wonderful, round-about way. The only change I made is to use fresh basil instead of parsley because our parsley plant is, um, dead, but it was still excellent! With some bread and a salad, this soup is a complete meal. This might sound weird, but next time, I would consider adding some bacon. I think that would kick up the flavor another notch! (Quoting Emeril now :o) Some potatoes or chicken added might be good as well. Then it would be almost like chicken stroganoff soup? Yummy. This is one of my favorite soups!!! Oh, by the way, it was so easy to make! I am 15 years old and have only been cooking for about a year or so and found it SO easy! In fact, I did it while doing my homework. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",

I used an \"exotic mushroom medley,\" (package description, not mine) which gave this great texture, different shapes, and bold flavor.  The dill and lemon both play their parts and have important contributions. I used a good, sweet Hungarian paprika which really makes a difference in the final result.  Just delicious, but you kind of have to wade through the parsley!",

I've settled into a recipe of using a variety of mushrooms (button, crimini, portobello, shitakii), fat-free half-and-half instead of milk, reduced fat sour cream, and a splash of sherry (in addition to the other original ingredients).  At the end, I use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup right in the pan, creating a smooth, creamy texture with chunks of mushrooms.  Wonderful!",

If all you have is salted butter to saute the onions and mushrooms with than eliminate the teaspoon of salt the recipe calls for at the end.  I didn't do this and found it to be much too salty.  The added soy sauce and chicken broth will also be salty so you might want to eliminate that extra teaspoon altogether if that's something you're concerned about.  However!
