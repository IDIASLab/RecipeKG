One of the things that I did different: After I removed all of the skin and the meat after the roasting time of the chicken - I roasted the bones and the veggies from the pot (I added more onions, carrot and celery) on an oiled baking sheet and baked them at 400\u00b0F for ~ 30 minutes so to extract a richer flavor from the bones and the veggies. I followed the remainder of the recipe except I substituted a large dried bay leaf in place of the thyme, added some fresh celery leafs from a celery bunch and black peppercorns after all of the foam and fat had been skimmed off. I never omit bay leafs, celery leafs or peppercorns when I make a broth/stock. I was leery of using ketchup in a broth but I used the Hunts\u00ae brand of ketchup because it doesn\u2019t have any high fructose corn syrup in it. Note: I wash off the dirt but I never pare carrots nor peel the outside skin off of onions for making broth/stock because I strive for all of the natural flavor and color that I can get into a broth/stock. After all, the broth is strained well and the bones seasonings and veggies are discarded at the end. The end result was perfect for my tastes and the ketchup added a surprisingly nice touch of flavor to the broth.",

There is so little of it and I just didn't want that in my \"natural\" broth.  It was good, but a little light on flavor for me and kind of too much work. (4 stars as written) So - I simplified.  I roasted the chicken & veggies as directed. I separated the meat then roasted the bones.  I placed the chicken bones and the veggies in my crock pot.  I deglazed the roasting pan with a good cup or so of white wine and put in the crock pot as well.  I added enough water to cover everything by an inch and set the crock pot to low.  I let this cook overnight.  In the morning I removed the bones and veggies.  I skimmed the broth and let it cool until I could put the whole thing in the refrigerator.  Once cold I removed the fat easily and underneath that was a beautiful, rich, gelatinous stock. Quite flavorful.  I froze the stock in 16 ounce containers. Easy and no babysitting the stove! (5 stars with these changes.)",

I wanted to make some of Chef Johns chicken noodle soup yesterday but only had one quart of broth. So instead of starting from scratch I bought one of those Rotisserie chickens, removed the breast meat and threw the bones, skin and all the rest into the stock pot with some carrots, onion, celery and garlic I'd carmellized in 2 Tb. butter. Simmered it for three hours as directed in Chef Johns recipe with his called for ingredients and Ta Da, I had 2 more quarts of stock that was just as tasty as the original home roasted one. I have found that the browner you get your roasted chicken to begin with the richer your stock will be. It does take all day if you roast your own chicken and mine is never browned or done in 1 hour so I usually make the stock on a day I have more time and then freeze it, if I'm not using it in the next day or so for soup. Love this recipe. I never liked my homemade chicken noodle soup until I found this recipe and his Chicken Noodle soup recipe also on AR. Thanks Chef John!",

And the dark meat rather than being discarded made our pups very happy for their supper! (very very careful to remove all bones of course)",
