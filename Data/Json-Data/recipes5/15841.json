My DH really liked this one. I cut the recipe back to one pepper and cut it in half rather than stuffing it. Since we do not eat olives I served it with extra feta cheese. Also served 'Feta Mashed Potatoes' from AR and sliced cucumbers. A good different recipe for peppers with a twist. I would make it again.",
