I used a heaping teaspoon of freshly ground pepper and you could definitely taste it in the finished gravy. Any more and I think it would've killed the dish. After making this, I've come to realize that there's no comparing a slow-cooker brisket to an oven-braised brisket. The oven makes it tastes that much better. Served this with the German Potato Pancakes recipe, and the German Red Cabbage recipe, both from this site. Very good. Also, mine cooked in about 3 1/2 hrs., but I trimmed close to 1/2 lb of fat from my 4 lb. brisket. This is my new favorite brisket recipe. ",

I didn't have a bay leaf, but threw everthing else on the list (EXCEPT used 2 tsp of pepper instead of 2 tbls) in a bowl and mixed well.  I also seared the brisket on the stove top real quick then put in a slow cooker/crock pot, covered with the beer mixture, and cooked on low for about 10 hours.  WOW.  Want an extra treat?  Mix 1/2 cup of whipped cream cheese with 1 Tablespoon prepared horseradish to serve along side the brisket.  Delish!",

I seered the brisket in a skillet sprayed lightly with Pam on the stove (med high to high heat) until light brown and I lightly sprayed the bottom of my baking dish with Pam before putting the brisket in just to make clean up easier.  I also followed one other reviewer's suggestion and used ale beer (not sure if regular beer versus ale beer mades a difference or not)but I assure you the brisket was moist, tender and absolutely wonderful.  I will definately use this receipe every time but do recommend that you seer any type of roast prior to baking - it just helps seal in the flavor and moisture of the meat.  I had very little left overs but the next day I chopped that up and added Head Country (brand) BBQ sauce and served on buns.  Those were fab too.",
