I couldn't taste the lime juice at all so didn't think it was worth adding and the small amounted of carbonated water did nothing for the drink other than making it seem like it had been sitting for a bit and gone flat. I would either remove it altogether and have a still drink or increase the amount drastically to have a partially carbonated drink that didn't seem like it had gone flat. Probably won't make again and just stick to my usual vodka cranberry juice and Sprite combo.",
