I used veganaise (instead of regular mayo) and omitted the jalapeno pepper - it was still spicy enough for me.  I would suggest you start with half the amount of curry powder and add more to taste.  I put the full amount in and felt it was just a tad too strong.  It still tasted great, but next time I'm going to try it this way aiming for the \"what's in there?\" mystery level of curry rather than \"wow that curry tastes good\".  I also substituted 1/2 of the red potatos for blue ones.  This made for a very colorful dish.",
