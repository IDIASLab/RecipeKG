Anyway the way I made it it was delicious; a bit different and my family loved it. I used low fat coconut milk which is a bit watery; added it all at once to the curry paste and boiled a while to reduce. I added the chicken pieces right at the end and simmered gently until just done. I halved the fish sauce and basil - it seemed a bit much. The end result had a well balanced and delicate flavour. BUT: I've dared myself to try the full amount of fish sauce and basil next time!",

                "reviewBody": "I really really enjoyed this. But I didn't rate this FIVE stars because there is room for improvement in the recipe as it is. First I did find the sauce a bit mild for my taste. It lacked a \"wow\" factor. It was still super delish like Thai comfort food though. Second and this is the big reason for the four stars I think that the cooking instructions need to be improved upon. If you cut your chicken into bite-size pieces and then brown in the curry-coconut mixture trust me your chicken will be cooked through without an additional 15 min. of simmer time. Additionally you do not need to pre-thaw your veggies and even frozen a 15 minute simmer just kills their texture color and taste. Finally like others said one can (2 cups) of coconut is more than adequate for the entire recipe. I even increased my chicken to 1 1/2 lbs and added a box of shitakes to my veggies and everything was still swimming in sauce and usually I like a lot of sauce. Here is how I would alter this: 1. Use one can of coconut milk total. I would still use half cup to cook chicken in and then just add the rest of the can later. 2. Increase the curry paste to 2 or 3 T 2. After my chicken has been browned I would add everything except the peppers basil and lime juice and then cook for only about five minutes--just until the veggies are done. Oh and I wouldn't bother to thaw them first. 3. I would add the red peppers at the very end then cut the heat off and pop in the basil and lime.",
