I followed the directions exactly except that I also added approximately one teaspoon of freshly grated orange zest to the marinade as well. Yes the marinade did add a nice orange-soy flavor to my salmon but both my husband and myself felt that it needed something more. In retrospect I find that I don't want to change the flavor of that wonderful fresh salmon with a marinade. I like the flavor as it is. Instead I'm going to try and create a sauce slightly thickened incorporating the orange soy honey and ginger to spoon over the fish after it's cooked and plated and just before serving. First I need to come up with one more ingredient to add more subtle texture to that sauce.",

Try a little lemon zest towards the end and it pops great with the citrus.",
