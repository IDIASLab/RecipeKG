I poured the sauce (I had a cup of peach syrup to use up and we love our gravies so why not make more) on top of the meat and covered it and baked it for 40 minutes at 350F. Served it with stove top fried diced potatoes and the canned peaches uncooked.",

Then added the sauce to which I added cornstarch and the peaches. I was afraid it would be too sweet but it was just right.
