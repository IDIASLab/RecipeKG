I subbed enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce and added 4 chopped canned chipotles in lieu of hot sauce. I have been told this is the best pork I have ever made. After 11 hours in the slow cooker I removed the bone and chunked the pork by breaking up the pieces. I prefer this to shredding because it allows the sauce flavor to seep into the meat. I served with soft tacos pico de gallo and diced avocado sprinkled with lime juice and some salt. It was excellent! If you are expecting a thick mole sauce this isn't it but you could remove the meat and thicken it I am sure. Excellent recipe. Thanks so much!",
