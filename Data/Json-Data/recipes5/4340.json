I noticed when reading the reviews that quite a few people complained that four garlic cloves were too many.  As I'm not a fan of raw garlic, I sauteed mine (all four of them)  for just a few minutes in a small amount of the olive oil before adding it to the rest of the ingredients in the food processor.  I did use Asiago as that is what I had in the fridge at the time and threw in a small handful of cilantro leaves for a dash of flavor - probably not the full 1/2 cup called for in the recipe.  Great recipe. EDIT:  I've made this many times now and everyone loves it, but have since adjusted the seasoning in one other area.  As the artichoke hearts are already nice and tangy from their marinade, I usually cut the lemon juice way back - to maybe a teaspoon.  That's all - just a personal preference.",

I do think I'll use one less clove of garlic next time, but that's only because I'm a moderate garlic lover--I definitely like it but I'm not one of those people who thinks you can never use too much of it.  I also think I'll use basil next time in place of cilantro, just because I like basil WAY more and I think it would go with the flavors better.  But cilantro is a good, cheaper option.    I served this at a dinner party and nobody could get enough of it.  They all commented on it being their favorite thing (and, of course, it was also the easiest).",

The cilantro in it is wonderful, but basil and/or parsley would be fine if you hate cilantro.  I doubled the recipe - and I'm glad I did. We had it on toasted onion bread the first night. This would be also be great on pasta or to stuff chops or tenderloin. Excellent, thanks!",
