I thought the amount of seasoning looked wimpy but I stuck close to the recipe and was pleased with the light fresh taste. The cooking time seemed excessive so I only simmered about 30-35 minutes total and it was fine. I topped it with pan fried asparagus and fresh parsley but wished I had had cilantro instead. Will definitely make this again.",
