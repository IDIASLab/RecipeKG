I made this on Friday during a snow storm and rather than grill outside (hee-hee), I marinated the chicken for 2 hours, then added everything, marinade and all, to a baking dish, covered with aluminum foil and baked in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Half-way through I used a turkey baster to coat chicken and prevent from drying.  After 30 minutes, I removed foil for 5 minutes to crisp top.  It came out perfect. Thank you!",

Subbed Dijon for Spicy brown mustard, and for the liquid smoke, I used about a Tbsp of Kitchen Bouquet and added a packet of Goya Ham Flavored Seasoning. I allowed the chicken to marinate for about 3-4 hours then grilled/smoked them on a charcoal grill.  Absolutely THE best chicken we have ever eaten!! It wasn't salty at all and I even used regular Soy Sauce. I fixed this for my husband and had the chicken ready when he got home. The chicken was grilled and carmel colored and we're fixing it again for the 4th!! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!",
