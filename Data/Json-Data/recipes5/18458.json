                "reviewBody": "My Friends here are a few tips to really enjoy this recipe: #1 The meat and the liquid (the sugar seasonings etc) must be COLD when you bring them together. If you take the mixture immediately off of the heat and then add it to the meat you're going to have problems. After you've finished the cooking of the mixture place it in a container and stick it in the fridge for a few hours. #2 Add the liquid in small amounts. When you notice the meat is just beginning to become saturated stop adding liquid. You may only use 2/3's of the mixture and that is OK. The burgers will still be plenty sweet and flavorful. #3 When cooking turn your grill up to high and pop those patties down. After you've loaded up your grill close the lid and leave them be for 5 minutes. NO PEAKING. After 5 minutes return flip close lid and don't peak for another 5 minutes. When you return they're done and you're all set to eat. We've really enjoyed this recipe and I'm looking forward to many more BBQ's featuring the Stowe Show. Thanks!",
