I was right. I have to say that shrimp without garlic just is a letdown. I love garlic so I used a whole garlic and I marinated the shrimp in garlic powder as well. Added about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes as well as 2 tablespoons of paprika. I also used olive oil along with the butter and used my homemade blueberry wine because it was all I had on hand. This one is my new go to. Thanks for the great recipe.",
