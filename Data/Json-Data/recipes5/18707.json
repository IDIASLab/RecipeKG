I did a quick soak on the beans and did not pre-cook them. I just put two cups of the soaking liquid in the crockpot. I followed the other directions exactly other than that I added two whole jalepenos to it (seeds and all) to give it a slight heat in the back of your throat when you eat it...it was so mild that my norweigen in-laws couldn't really tell that I had added it. The beans came out darker colored (normal when making them in the crockpot) but the taste is out of this world!! You must try this recipe!!!",

                "reviewBody": "I was looking for a basic recipe that did not include canned beans (too much sodium) and tasted like Mom's top-of-the-stove baked beans; this is a keeper! Did not follow the recipe exactly but found it the perfect base for what I was looking for. My changes (and methods used): Soak beans in water overnight; dump all soak water then boil beans with fresh water (enough to cover beans) for about 20 minutes or until beans are soft and 'mush' between your fingers. Next drain beans; RESERVE & SET ASIDE ALL LIQUID. Fry 6 pieces of bacon one onion (both chopped) until bacon is brown & crisp. Drain bacon grease return beans bacon and onion to pot and add remaining ingredients: -enough reserve liquid to cover beans -1/2 cup brown sugar -1/2 cup maple syrup -1/2 cup ketchup -1/4 cup prepared mustard (I used mix of regular yellow stone ground) -2 TBS apple cider vinegar -Did not use salt pork or molasses. IF you like your beans less sweet start w/ less sugar/syrup & add more later if needed. Cooking method: on top of the stove using my grandmother's \"soup pot\" (cast aluminum/ dutch oven pot). Dish is ready in under 2 hours (excluding overnight soak time). I also fry bacon and onion in this same pot which adds extra bacon flavor to the beans even with the grease drained off. My beans have been on the stove top for only 20 minutes but I keep going back for another taste! This will be a delicious side dish to go with our home made BBQ & slaw.",

IMHO it doesn't do a darn thing for the after effects or the taste and just takes up more of my time. \n\nAnyway, I thought the stuff looked a little strange when I mixed it up in the slow cooker, but I took it on faith that it'd turn out. I don't use a slow cooker often, so what do I know about what it's supposed to look like, anyway? I went to bed with the stuff going and when I got up in the morning my whole house smelled amazing. (Always a good sign)\n\nI opened the lid on my crock pot, and oh happy day! Beautiful brown, sweet baked beans with a gorgeous thick sauce! People were practically pile driving into them at the BBQ, and the leftovers didn't last long! \n\nI'm a true believer now and I have no plans to ever make baked beans in the oven again.  To all you people who think you have to fiddle with every recipe you come across (which I admit I'm usually one of them), do yourself a favor and make this exactly as it says once before you mess with it; you'll be glad you did. I may someday sub out half the molasses with maple syrup to make it taste like my Vermont born and raised grandmothers recipe, but that's a nostalgia thing for me, not a reflection on the recipe.",
