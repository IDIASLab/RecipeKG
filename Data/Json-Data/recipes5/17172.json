I made it a little differently on accident, just because I wasn't reading close enough, I ended up adding the ketchup to the meat and it was still really really good. I think i'll add it to the meat from now on actually. The topping was great too, I used crushed canned pineapple in it's own juice and that turned out fine. I'll make this again for sure. It was really quick to make also, no more than 10min prep really. This is also very flexable, so if you want to add or change ingrediants, it will still be very good.",

It's too sweet and gives it a weird flavor.\" My sister said it was good but extremely sweet. Nobody went for seconds and my father was at a meeting so I had a lot left over. Since the texture of the meat was very good I tried to correct the problem. The next night I rinsed the topping off the chilled leftovers. Made a standard topping (ketchup brown sugar Dale's marinade). I placed the loaves (I made individual meatloaves) in a dish with 1/8 cup of water (to prevent drying during reheating) and used the new topping. My family was very happy said that this time it was great.",
