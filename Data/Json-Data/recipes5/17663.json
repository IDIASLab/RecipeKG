To tell you the truth I usually don't even try something if it doesn't have AT LEAST four stars (learned my lesson) but I was short-handed on ingredients and this recipe fit. In fact I still didn't have the brown sugar and just used organic cane instead plus we use Mrs. Braggs aminos instead of soy sauce but no one seemed to care because they were so busy eating the ribs and sopping up the sauce that it was pretty silent at the table. I'm not a Korean food guru and have no idea what ingredients it is \"supposed\" to have but I do know when something tastes incredible and this was one of the most incredible marinades for beef I've ever tasted. The only mistake I made was cooking beef ribs instead of a beef rib roast. There just wasn't enough meat to satiate our addicted pallets!!! Next time I'm just gonna use a round roast...maybe two...or three (jk)!!! Delightful give it a try! Thanks Lindsay.",

I didn't have a roast so I used beef ribs and cooked it in a crockpot on low for about 9 hours and the ribs came out so tender and my whole family couldn't get enough and are already begging me to make more. This is definitely worth a try and I wouldn't alter a thing in it. Just remember to use a good brand soy sauce and curry or the quality will suffer.",

My family literally ignored the roast potatoes and vegetables I cooked and devoured just the meat!

I put it on beef ribs but it would be equally good on steak or chicken. And it was so easy - no marinading time needed just slap it on and your done!
