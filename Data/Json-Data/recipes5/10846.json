Ended up looking like truffles and tasting like an almond joy! Subbed 1/2 cup of roasted hazelnuts for 1/2 cup of the raw cashews. Takes longer than you think in the food processor. I though it wouldnt come together  but I just kept going (and added another tbs of coffee) and it formed a mass eventually.  Super tasty, cant recommend these enough.",

The taste a lot like RX Bars but they have more texture, which I really liked.  I think if  I had sprinkled some flaky salt on the top the would taste like salted caramel bars.  I did add a tablespoon of honey since they seemed a bit dry.  My only problem was my food processor is not big enough to make the whole recipe.  I used half the ingredients and made it twice.  I will absolutely make these again and again. Thanks so much Chef John",
