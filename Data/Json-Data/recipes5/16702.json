Did not encounter any problems noted by previous reviewers. Pulsed walnuts/dates in food processor until nice mix of fine and small bits to insure everything held together. No need for extra egg. Placed on parchment paper on cookie sheet, baked the full 17 minutes. They came out of the oven looking like an undercooked cookie w/browned coconut exterior.  No problem...they just need to set. I slid the parchment paper, cookies and all, onto a wire rack to cool completely.  VERY hard to wait....the smell was amazing! But, while warm they fall apart.  Once cool they were perfect and yummy.",
