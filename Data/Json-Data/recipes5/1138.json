I also used agave syrup instead of the honey so my parents could eat it. They are both diabetics. We are all crazy for balsamic so paired it with some sauteed kale, onions, garlic splashed with balsamic  and roasted cauliflower with thyme and rosemary.All very delish and low glycemic. Will definitely make again.   Also I used leg quarters cut up into thighs and legs. I catch them on sale for less than 4$/10 lbs once a month, so budget friendly.",

Thickened it with cornstarch and served it over brown basmati rice as an accompaniment. I think the sauce benefited from the onion and garlic in the vegies. It's a keeper recipe.",
