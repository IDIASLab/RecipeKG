I found the end result to be a bit greasy next time I'll dump 1/2 the bacon grease and leave just enough to coat the pan. I would also like to add more flavor to this dish. Some of the versions I read called for Seasoning Salt. I added Lawry's Seasoned Salt in addition to salt and pepper but next time I'll go a little heavier. Overall - not my all time favorite but a good dish to accompany corned beef and cabbage (see slow cooker recipe for an easy meal!)",
