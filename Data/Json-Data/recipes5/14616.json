I did make a few small changes such as no corn/corn byproducts because of allergies and honestly who needs cheap fillers like that with all of the other good stuff in this recipe? Used smoked spices because I didn't have liquid smoke (I also blackened the smoked spices onto the pork roast when I browned it which was amazing.) All in all I look forward to making it again! My brother-from-another-mother won't give me his Abuela's secret recipie; but this was close enough that it curbed the cravings!",
