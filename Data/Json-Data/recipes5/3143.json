I have never really liked the taste of seafood salad from the deli at the supermarket because it always tastes too fishy. I mixed everything together in the largest bowl I have and let it refridgerate overnight. The result was fantastic. I used this for a side dish for Easter dinner and the serving bowl was empty in minutes!!\r\nThis will definitely be made again and again. Very tasty dish!!!",

I cut the recipe in half & used 1/2 lb. frozen salad shrimp & 2 cans of lump crab meat (next time I will only use one can of crab & maybe increase the shrimp a bit). I rinsed the crab to remove the tinny fishy taste canned seafood can have. Because my seafood was pre-cooked I omitted the sauteing. I did not have any celery so I used a bit of celery salt. I added some frozen peas (thawed) additional old bay seasoning (quite a bit actually) ground black pepper about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese (in addition to the mozzarella) about 1/2 cup of sour cream & a bit of extra lemon juice. I chopped up my toasted almonds a bit (they were a really good touch...added just the right crunch & toasted nuttiness). Served it out on the patio on a bed of lettuce leaves garnished w/ a lemon wedge w/ club crackers & a pomegranitini (from this site). Yummm!",

Doubled the receipe (works good) lined the plater with lettuce garnished with parsley lemons and limes (should have taken a picture; sorry I didn't everyone commented on how appetizing it looked). Fabulous HIT. They LOVED it and so did our neighbors and friends. Most of the time people ask for the recipe this time they came with their own paper and pen to write it down. After reading the reviews about the seasoning and mayo. I tried this and it seemed to work good. Stir fry your shrimp and crab(I used imitation crab) in butter and crushed garlic then sprinkle Old Bay on the seafood mixture while it's warm. After the pasta has cooled sprinkle with Old Bay and mix well.I prepared the dressing with equal amounts of sour cream and mayo then added lemon juice Old Bay 4 tbsp milk 2 tbsp vinegar and a couple of dashes of vinegar (total of 5 cups in all) but remember I doubled the recipe. The neighbors the quilters our friends loved your recipe. Thank you so very much for sharing. I will definately make this again; over and over. Both the men and ladies LOVED IT. p.s. I also added red pepper for color and some shredded cheddar. FABULOUS!!!! Thank you",
