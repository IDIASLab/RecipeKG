Stir and cook for about 3-4 min. (oats will be coated and continue to toast).  Then add 1/3 c. dried cranberries (or raisins) and stir 1 more min.  Spread mixture back on cookie sheet (lightly coated w/ cooking spray) and return to warm oven (broiler is off) for about 15-30 min. This allows granola to continue drying out.  So yummy and much cheaper than store bought!!!  Can't wait to try other nuts and maybe dried blueberries (for hubby).  Have fun making this recipe your own...",

                "reviewBody": "I love this recipe. It is quick and easy, but I gave it four stars, because it would have been less perfect had I not made some changes. As other reviewers suggested I added the rest of the ingredients,(almonds, cranberries...) in the last five minutes of cooking. At that same time, I also added coconut flakes, pecan pieces, raisins and cinnamon to the mix(~handful of each). I would have added more stuff had I had any more leftover dried fruits or anything! I did not increase the amount of the base ingredients though, and it still came out fabulous! Also a very easy trick to transfer the oats back to the skillet is to lay them on a tray lined with parchmint paper. All you need to do, is carry the oats while securely holing both sides of the length of the paper up, while carriying the oats inside. Make sure one hand is holding the back side of the paper closed so that nothing falls out, and the other hand holding near the front at the top. It is now a breeze to pour the oats back into the skillet sliding them down the parchmint \"tube\". Use the exact same method when pouring the whole thing into container after cooled. Easy transfer, and easy cleanup! Thanks for the recipe, great base for delicious granola, and can be very similar to quaker oat cereal, yet much healthier and cheaper!",

Like others I have some changes to really make it a 5 and they are: added 1/2 c wheat germ to the oats and nearly doubled the honey and butter (to compensate for additional dry ingredients). Also when cooking the syrup I added vanilla cinnamon and a pinch of salt. When I added the oats/germ back into the pan with the syrup I added the other ingredients then too to evenly coat them all simultaneously. I also added coconut flakes and sunflower seeds. I cooked all of the ingredients together for a few minutes on the stove stirring constantly then baked on a cookies sheet at 400 for 8 minutes. I then let it set out for 30 minutes scored with a knife let finish hardening then broke apart into pieces. Even though I initially almost burned the oats/germ by not stirring constantly it still turned out great!",

After mixing it all together per instructions I put it under the broiler (on low) for 2 minutes stir and then 1 minute at a time until it's golden brown stirring after each minute.

                "reviewBody": "Oh dear. With the suggestion to halve the butter-sugar-honey coating, this granola turns out delicious, but as written I'm afraid it's nearly inedible. Far too sweet, more like an oat brittle candy than a granola.  One thing I never did have trouble with was sogginess. You really do need the full 5 minutes and it really does need to be over medium heat at least. If you skip this step you will have soggy granola, because its purpose is to raise the temperatures of the butter and sugars, changing them into candy.  I like to use virgin coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and add unsweetened dried coconut and a lot of flaxseed meal. Add the flaxseed meal at the end of cooking, just before you spread the granola out to cool, so the flax oils aren't damaged by the heat. Poppy seeds are nice too.",
