Perhaps the fact that when you take the chicken out of the pan it doesn't look extremely appealing to the eye was what turned others off? Whatever the case.. I think I will make this again b/c it's quick and very easy and pretty tasty. I won't change the amount of the ingredients because the extra makes for a good sauce for dipping. The only thing I may try different next time is to brown the chicken a little before putting in the margarita mix into the skillet to make it more brown and to make it look nicer.",
