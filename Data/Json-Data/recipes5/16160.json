        "description": "Tonkatsu is a Japanese version of deep-fried pork chops with a special tangy sauce. Though the air fryer will never duplicate a true deep-fried taste, the appliance is fast, cleanup is a breeze, and there is no used oil to store.  Tonkatsu is usually served with raw cabbage, but use this handy air fryer technique, call it \"fried pork chops\", and serve with your family favorites. I won't tell them it's Japanese, if you don't!",
