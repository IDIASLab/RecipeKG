The point of the recipe is to have the apple standing and to cook the spices inside it, with the butter bubbling them out over the edges. Use Granny Smith apples and if you don't have a corer, use a paring knife and cut a wide mouth, angling it toward the center of the apple. I accidentally sliced all the way through one of the apples and all the good stuff oozed right out of it, which is why I wouldn't recommend slicing the apples. This was an excellent compliment to my pork chops dinner.",

I think the apple would cook uniformly. Pieces of the whole apple weren't done and I had to cook again. Overall a great recipe!!!",

So, juices oozed out from the apples upon cooked but nevertheless, it was still a delish! The next time around, I will probably slice the apples to try a different feel. It was so extremely easy and fun to \u201cbake\u201d these wonder apples with a microwave indeed! Thank you Nicole for this wonderful recipe...*UPDATES* Made this again using 3 Royal Galas last nite using sliced apples layed with cinnamon, brown sugar & raisin mixture on each layer and microwaved it for 4 full minutes and let it sit for 2 minutes in the microwave. Apples turned out wonderfully delicious, sweet and evenly \"baked\" within the heavily-spiced up sauce. It's now a 5-star from me and hubby, no question about it!!",
