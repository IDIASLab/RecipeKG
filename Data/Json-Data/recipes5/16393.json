Also, I used whole wheat pastry flour for half of the flour, butter instead of shortening, and yogurt instead of sour cream.  I added raisins for some more texture.  For the frosting, I made a cinammon whipped cream cheese frosting and sprinkled the top with crushed walnuts.  I made the cake for a friend's birthday and everyone loved it.  The ginger really adds something special.",

I used Sour Cream Frosting as a glaze and the flavors worked together nicely but since the frosting turned out to be a glaze it didn't hide my cake's defects. This cake is fantastic with coffee.",
