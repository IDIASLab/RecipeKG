First since the apple tends to get a little soggy after sitting in the fridge for awhile I substitute Asian pear which has a firmer texture. I also substitute chopped dried apricots for half of the dates add a couple tablespoons of chopped walnuts and use regular nonfat yogurt instead of lemon all to my personal taste. This is definitely a great recipe -- makes a wonderful lunch accompanied by wheat crackers and sliced kiwi fruit.",
