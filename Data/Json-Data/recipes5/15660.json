I've never raved about a dish so much before (I've never even left a rating on a past dish but this one is well worth it). Instead of the packaged taco seasoning I used a seasoning found on this site - Taco Seasoning I - it's de'lish! Everyone loved it even my skeptical husband. It will be a regular.",

The only changes I would make next time are to cook the onion and jalapeno in water as i don't think it would make a taste difference and to reduce the squash for awhile as there was quite a lot of liquid which made for soggy taco shells.

The spaghetti squash I had was rather small so I only used about half the dry taco seasoning and served them with grated cheese and chopped Romaine lettuce. I made my own taco shells with preservative-free corn tortillas in a deep fat fryer. Despite all these minor changes the tacos were quite good. One did not miss the meat. The cheese added a little protein. This is a mild vegetarian gluten-free (check the taco seasoning) but not vegan or casein-free version. Quite good.
