Yes indeed growing up in the '60s and even now in some homes Sundays breakfasts usually consisted of 'Buojol' along with scrambled eggs 'hops bread' or 'bake' (a fried flat bread or thick stovetop roasted flat bread) as well as a green salad West Indian style. In my home and many others I visited this dish was never cooked. The saltfish (salted cod to Americans) was soaked overnight rinsed out twice before using flaked and combined with the other ingredients all of which were fresh and raw chopped minced or crushed--onions garlic tomatoes sprig of thyme some times fresh watercress in bite size pieces (no lettuce) scotch bonnet pepper or bird pepper a little crushed black pepper slivers of green onives (chives) olive oil and vinegar or freshly squeezed lemon juice. Avocados could be cubed and lightly tossed just before serving or on the side if preferred. Sliced hard boiled eggs were optional. The fish was the greatest quantity of ingredients balanced to one's taste.",
