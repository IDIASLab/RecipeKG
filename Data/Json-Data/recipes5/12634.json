You can pretty much tell by looking at the ingredients that there wasn't a lot of oomph here.  So, you spice it up!  I added chopped garlic and celery to the saute, and to the stew itself plenty of black pepper and my favorite garlic and herb Mrs. Dash.  We used spinach instead of kale and it was pretty darned good!!  I'll make this again I am sure.",

I don't have an Instant Pot so I made this in my Le Creuset braising pan which is especially good for browning the meat. I found the sauce a bit too watery (thickening with flour won't work for low carb eating) so I removed the chicken from the liquid and boiled it down to a fourth of original amount then whisked in four chunks of cold butter to make a thick pan sauce. Then the chicken was popped back in to the braising pan to heat through. Oh my this is good! I took leftovers to the job for lunch today and it was even better after sitting a day. I also used boneless chicken thighs rather than breast meat. Be sure to remove the chicken before reducing the stock. Nothing worse than dry overcooked chicken!",

However I used Better Than Bullion to make the chicken stock which is on the saltier side and I bought diced tomatoes that also contained salt. It wasn't horribly salty or anything but next time I would probably use no-salt diced tomatoes and/or a low-sodium chicken stock. There was a lot of liquid in the finished product but it didn't say to drain the diced tomatoes. Not sure if I was supposed to or not. Anyway the liquid was probably good for cooking it. I just used a slotted spoon when dishing it out to serve. Overall I thought it was very good and I would make it again.",
