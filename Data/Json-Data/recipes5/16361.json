I thought this would be a nice challenge for me to try.\nI proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the sugar and warm water for ten minutes. Then, I added in all the dry ingredients. (I cut back on the pepper a bit and added garlic powder, but kept everything else the same.) I added in the cheese last, using sharp cheddar. \nWhen I used the dough hook, I had to add a tbsp. of oil to get the ingredients to grab together and jump on the hook. I kneaded it for about five minutes with the hook, then set the dough in a oiled bowl on my warm oven to rise, covered with saran wrap and a towel. I let it rise twice, once for an hour in the bowl and once in the bread pan for a half hour. Then, I baked it in a 350* oven for about a half hour or so. (I don't usually time my breads. My instincts are pretty good about when it smells done.)\nThis smells heavenly. I can't wait to serve it with dinner. Super easy for me.\nA bread maker is not needed for this recipe! EDITED: This turned out perfectly. Making this without a bread machine, I had no issues with the bread collapsing. And the flavor was unbelievable. I'd make this again and again.",

I don't care for sugar in my breads anyway, so I should have just left it out altogether.  Unlike other reviewers I did not add oil, as the cheese (I used cheddar) contributes enough on its own. I used only half the amount of seasoning called for - I just used thyme, rosemary, basil and oregano. I loved the addition of the black pepper, which gave this a pleasant, spicy bite. For a browner, more crackly crust I chose to use the French Bread cycle.  I was tempted to stick with the more traditional ratio of one cup liquid to three cups of flour and wish I had.  I ended up having to add more flour, probably another few tablespoons.  Other than a sticky, wet dough in the beginning and it rising too much for me, this was a lovely, fragrant, moist bread.",
