If you really want to get the most taste out of the salmon, try pan frying it after marinating with a little olive oil, searing both sides and locking in the juices, then save the left over marinade, add 1 tbsp corn starch, and heat until thick.  It will make a great sauce that you can just lightly spread on top of the salmon.  I tried this with my second attempt and my wife and I liked it much better.",

I changed a few things to suit our tastes - used 1/2 the amount of soy and brown sugar used the juice of one lemon and ground black pepper instead of lemon pepper and 3 cloves of crushed garlic instead of garlic powder. After marinating the salmon overnight in a baking dish I put the whole dish with all the marinade in the oven and baked for 20 minutes. I took the skin off at the end. Delicious!",

I agree with a previous poster, it is a $20 entree in a medium size city but I would add, a $30 entree in a big city.  Since I have a 7 yr old and an 8 yr old and a 1 yr old eating this too, I was apprehensive about the amount of lemon pepper.  I had doubled the recipe for the marinade because I was using 2 lbs of salmon, but I only used 2 tsp of lemon pepper instead of 4.  It was not too peppery at all.  Next, I must admit I was skeptical about thickening the marinade and cooking it and pouring it over the top like some reviewers recommended.  I had always heard you should promptly discard your marinade.  But I figured I was cooking the marinade so any bacteria would be killed so why not give it a try.  Well, I am glad I did....it was awesome.  So elegant, it would be such a waste to forgo a step that would only take 5 extra minutes.\nEveryone loved it and couldn't stop saying thanks Mom, its great! My 8 yr old requested this every New Year's Eve...I think we will have it again way before that : )",

I marinaded overnight and took earlier suggestions to make the remaining into a sauce for the fish.  It was perfect.  I added a little over a tablespoon of cornstarch and made sure to boil the mix for a few minutes (stirring constantly) just in case any bacteria still existed.  This was my first time broiling and it couldn't have turned out better.  The timing is incredibly accurate.  I served it with Scoopnana's Sesame Noodles and Josie's Asian Avocado.  The extra sauce was also good over the noodles.  The meal was altogether fantastic.",
