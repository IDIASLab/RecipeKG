I added peanuts to the dry ingredients and the chocolate powder went into the wet ingredients, as suggested by another reviewer.  I thought that the wet ingredients were not wet enough, so I also added 3 tbsp of butter.  I originally tried pouring the wet ingredients on top of the dry ingredients, as written the recipe.  However, they would not seep down (wet ingredients still too thick), so I ended up just mixing them in.  I'm so glad I did; it was not crumbly at all, and it was delicious. I'll definitely be making this again, with the modifications as described.     ",

I love the fact that you can use whatever you have in the kitchen and it still turns out yummy. I've made this twice -once with coconut once without. Both times it was good although i did like it with the coconut better. I used chunky pb didn't have sesame seeds so i added slivered almonds and flax seeds instead. Came out delicious. One thing I did notice is that it doesn't taste so great right after you make it. Wait a day or so and it's perfect! Next time I'm going to add even more coconut and I'll add some marshmellows too. (not very healty I know but still good.) Happy non-baking!",
