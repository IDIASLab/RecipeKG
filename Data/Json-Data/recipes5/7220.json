I basically doubled all the ingredients even the cayenne pepper (and it wasn\u2019t hot, it had a nice flavor to it). I also lightly seasoned my shrimp with salt and pepper after laying it in the pan because when I tasted the sauce, it was a bit bland. I also added (I halved them) small cherry tomatoes about 12 minutes in. The color was a very nice addition. As the cook suggested, I used the 50/50 cheese mix of parmesan, Asiago cheeses because the store didn\u2019t have Asiago cheese. I\u2019m glad double the recipe because my family almost ate it all! Only about 2 servings is left! One portion would not have been enough! I will make this recipe again & again.",
