I  used the 4 thickest filets from half a whole salmon, thinking I'd eat 2 with my baked potato and lemon garlic broccoli, then save the other 2 for tacos or such the next day. it was a good plan! It was so delicious, I ended up eating it all! Don't judge! LOL I'm a healthy eater, my weight remains steady, and I often only eat 2 meals a day. Grilling salmon this way is the main reason I bought my Ninja Foodie Grill & Air Fryer several months ago. whatever cooking method you use, it's crucial you remove the salmon just before you think it's fully done because it will continue to cook for another couple minutes which I've learned is the difference between flakey, moist filets and dry overcooked ones.",
