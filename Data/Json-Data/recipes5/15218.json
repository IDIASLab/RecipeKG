I made it as called for with the exception of cooking my lentils in beef broth. After tasting, I added a half teaspoon of cumin, and maybe a quarter tsp of garam masala. I found this stepped it up a notch, but really what makes the dish is the Greek yogurt (or sour cream) you serve it with. With a little extra spice and the yogurt/cream on top, I think this is five stars. I've been looking for budget friendly dishes to work into my line up. I think I'll make this again.",
