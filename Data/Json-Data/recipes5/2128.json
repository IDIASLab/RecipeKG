Fresh turkey sausage can be tricky to find in my area and I couldn't get my hands on any Italian but found a jalapeno cheddar one that worked great as well. One of the highlights for me is that the bell peppers were not added until the last 10 minutes. Most recipes cook them to death which is a huge pet peeve of mine. Another highlight to point out is that I was able to pull my container out of the fridge 30 minutes before lunch time and it was excellent at room temperature. The lines for the microwave at work can be lengthy so this was a huge bonus for me. I will make this often and experiment with the different turkey sausages I find.",
