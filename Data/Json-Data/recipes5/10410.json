In my mind, I was questioning the amount of broth that the recipe calls for.  Indeed, I was correct.  After having baked for a total 80 minutes and then rested for 20 minutes the vegetables were sitting in a pool of milky liquid.  I had to scoop out some of the vegetables, drain the liquid, make a roux and thicken the liquid.  Still, the flavor of the dish was lacking.  Because the vegetables were not seasoned while cooking there was just no way to season them properly.  1 - 1/4 cups cream, NO broth, add onion and season the vegetables after blanching in the salted water would fix this.  But that would be a different recipe, wouldn't it?",

                "reviewBody": "Oh, my goodness.  This is good!  I have never in my 53 years tasted a celery root or a rutabaga, so I had my reservations.  The hubby was convinced that he would not like this.  But....it's a winner.  As usual, I made variations based on what I had on hand, but pretty much followed the recipe as is.  I was not able to find a yukon gold potato (what???) so used 3 good sized red potatoes.  The turnips that I found were smallish, so I used 2.  The parsnips that I found were skinny, so I used 3.  Celery root???  I guessed it was about the right size, so I went with it as I did with the rutabaga.  Prepped all as in Chef John's video.  For those that found that they wound up with a \"watery mess\"...my best suggestion is to simmer your sauce down for more than 5 minutes.  Common sense, my fellow cooks!  I simmered mine LOW for probably 20 minutes until it had begun to thicken some.  I also added a bit more salt (after taking a taste of the blanched veggies) to the sauce and a light sprinkle over the top of the veggies in the baking dish before I poured the sauce over.  As usual, I had to use regular old parmesean from the can. The rest time is important.  The casserole tightened up a good bit during the resting.  This is SO good.  Because of personal taste, next time, I'll probably leave off the rutabaga and celery root.  Lots of lefties, and I look forward to re-warming and serving with a poached egg as Chef John suggested in his potato and parsnip gratin recipe.",
