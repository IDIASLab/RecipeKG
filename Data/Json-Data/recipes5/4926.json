That being said it was worth the wait. I used 1 tablespoon each of fresh herbs as opposed to the dried and think this was a wise choice. I used onion powder in place of onions because my husband won't eat onions and left out the capers because I didn't have any. After reducing the broth it concentrated the sodium so next time I think I would choose a low sodium broth/stock.  A few other reviewers mentioned the sauce not thickening up after simmering. Since the chicken is coated and browned in corn starch, which is a thickener, I thought that may help thicken the sauce in the oven. But I went ahead and took a little extra chicken broth and corn starch and thickened the sauce just a tad before covering the chicken. I'm glad I did. It was the perfect consistency when removing from the oven. The sauce is so yummy I kept taste testing while it was simmering :) The thighs were nice and tender but I may consider using BLSL breasts next time. We think this recipe is restaurant quality and definitely a keeper!",

I did make a lot more because I started out with 36 chicken thighs cut up and therefore adjusted all the other ingredients accordingly!  I was forced to slightly change the cooking method because of my needs so I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't add the cream until much later.  I made everything according to the recipe (excluding the cream)a day ahead of time.  Then today I put the chicken with its sauce in my 6-liter slow cooker on \"keep warm\" which gets it very hot.  About 10 minutes before we were to eat, I added the cream (and a bit of sour cream - oops!  That is a little change)  For my large crowd this was PERFECT chicken!  There was some leftover and everyone was asking if they could take it home which is always what I hope for - no leftovers at all!  Thanks Faith!  A perfect recipe for me!",

This was delicious and while it did take some time to prepare, it was well worth it.  I followed recipe exactly with one minor change - 3/4 tsp of Rosemary because I am always afraid it will be too strong.  That was NOT a problem.  What I like is that while each step is boiling/simmering, I could prepare for the next step.  I started cooking the chicken when I put in the mushrooms.  That timing worked out perfectly so that the sauce was ready at the same time as the chicken; probably because I used bone-in, skin-on thighs (oops).\nI too had a problem with sauce thickness.  Maybe I'll toss a little cornstarch in after the first few minutes next time and there will be many next times!  Thank you Faith!",
