The first cooking time (for the broth) I cut back to 30 min; also I used all the broth and only added a little extra water. I cooked the lentils for about 30 minutes until tender but not mushy the way I like them and I did not simmer it a full 15 minutes after adding the remaning ingredients. I think this would also be very good with spinach or any other green in place of the chard.",

I made this vegetarian by using veg broth instead of chicken. I went a littler heavier on the thyme sprigs and used a little less than 1/2 cup of lemon juice. I suggest adding 1/4 cup at first tasting it and then adding lemon as needed. The soup has a lot of depth when it comes to flavor and the lemon and thyme have your taste buds craving more. I highly recommend this wonderful hearty soup!",

To the soup mixture step-while sauteeing the onion and garlic ADD a teaspoon of garlic. YUM! Great recipe.",
