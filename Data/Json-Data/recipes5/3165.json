Since the orzo was a thicker larger substance than the couscous it worked better with the cucumber. I also used 2 whole cucumbers which was NOT too much. I made it recently as a main dish and just added sliced chicken breast (grilled on the George Forman with lemon pepper seasoning - EASY!)... it was just right. Thanks for submitting this recipe it's one of my favorites!",
