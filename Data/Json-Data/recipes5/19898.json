It is also known as Stifado if you use pearl onions, but I didn't have any and had to use yellow onion. I have to add potatoes and carrots! Be very careful with the amounts of salt, cinnamon and ground cloves. Works very well with moose or venison. I serve it with J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits (try making those with buttermilk). Yum!",
