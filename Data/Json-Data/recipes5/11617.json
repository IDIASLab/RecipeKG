I didn't have Herbes de Provence  (in 50+ years of cooking , I've never either bought it or made it; perhaps one day, lol) so I substituted 5 Spice (a flavor my family is familiar with) in its stead. I also substituted approx. 1 Tbls.  chopped Scallions (Spring Onions) for the Onion Powder (we like Scallions and I liked the \"color\" it added to the mix). I wasn't sure about using the Almond Flour, but it worked very well with this recipe. I doubled the recipe for the Meatballs, tripled it for the Dip, and served it alongside a favored Collard Greens side (what can I say? my Family is strange, lol).  We were 9 for that Dinner \"seating\" (6 Adults, 2 Teenage boys, and a very picky \"tween\" girl) and while there WERE  \"leftovers\", they were scant (DH had them today for lunch. He's also requested that I make them again \"when we're alone\". Now if THAT's not a \"success story\", I don't know what is! lol)",
