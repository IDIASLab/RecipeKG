I actually used cow cheeks and there was alot of meat on it. Depending on your area you might have to order the cow cheeks ahead of time. I am going to try it again but upping the spices a bit. Overall it was pretty darn good..for your info too barbacoa was actually made with lamb or goat meat in the past..",
