It took an incredibly short amount of time to prepare and I had most of the ingredients in my kitchen (and others are inexpensive and easy to find). I put it on a wicker \"plate\" and decorated it with flowers and it looked like a little country birthday cake. IT WAS A HIT! Everyone in my family had multiple servings and wanted the recipe.",

This was the first cake I ever made and It turned out looking great tasted great and smelled great too. The batter was yummy. I baked this cake for 55 minutes and it was slightly dry. Next time I will try 50 minutes and it should be perfect! This recipe was great but I would not really call it a cake. To me it was more like a dessert bread. It was baked in a loaf pan and it seemed like a sweet bread instead of a cake. Maybe next time I could double the ingredients and put it in a round cake pan to seem more like an actual cake.",
