I added chopped pecans which I felt was a worthy addition.  This makes a ton!  I doubled the recipe for a pot luck and couldn't fit it in the biggest bowl I own!

So, I tried it and it is irresistible!  My husband also loved it.  In preparation, I used 8 oz. of Cool Whip instead of 12 oz., it just looked and tasted perfect with the 8 oz., so I went with it.  Also, I was gonna wait and put the bananas in right before serving it so they wouldn't turn brown or mushy, but I forgot to add them and it still turned out perfect without them!  I used 1 cup of colored marshmallows and 1 cup of white marshmallows - perfect!  Definitely a 5 star recipe!  You won't be sorry you tried this recipe....",
