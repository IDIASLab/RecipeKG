Sumac, usually sold ground, is ground red berries and used in Middle Eastern, particularly Lebanese, cooking. Purslane is succulent with a lemony flavor, and makes a nice salad green.

So, according to my mother-in-law (a little of this and a bit more of that) you add the sumac to the onions that you have chopped in the bowl.  The sumac is mixed into the onions and it is used liberally.  All vegetables are chopped into the bowl. Then mixed together with salt, black pepper, lemon juice and olive oil. At the very end you mix in the toasted pita bread (make sure you pull the pita apart so you have two rounds before you toast).  Then enjoy!",
