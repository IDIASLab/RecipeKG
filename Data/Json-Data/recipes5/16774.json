I refrigerated my dough overnight and it firmed up nicely. I'd suggest using parchment paper with these. They come off the sheet beautifully. I used a small cookie scoop which made perfectly uniform-sized round cookies. These do spread - you'd have to expect this with any dough that includes fruit puree or butters. The edges of the finished cookies are slightly chewy and the cookies are soft as promised. We really enjoyed these. They were a nice was to use up some homemade apple butter. Thanks for a tasty recipe!",

The only changes were some white sugar for the brown (didn't have enough) spicy tea for the coffee (used slightly more) raisins for the walnuts (plumped in the additional tea I used) and 1/4 cup more flour (to compensate for the extra liquid). I didn't have any major spreading or sticking issues (I greased my cookie sheets). I think the timing is a little off- start checking at 8 mins if you make TBspfuls of dough. These were cake-like with slightly crisp edges though their flavour was bland and lacking. Not something I'd make again.",
