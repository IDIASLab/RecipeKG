She insisted that I try some of the cake and she raved abotu the exceptional taste and flavor. To me the cake tasted the same as all the other fruitcakes I had encountered. I think that if you are really a fruitcake lover and are looking for a wonderful recipe you've met your match. However if you really don't like fruitcake don't expect this recipe to work miracles. This cake is nothing special unless you especially love fruitcake.",
