I also added crushed red pepper to spice it up. Also instead of balls I formed an oblonged type shaped. Once cooked (in an 400 degree oven rather than frying) I inserted wooden skewers for easy handling. Try drizzling extra sauce over the skewers once plated and set a bowl of sauce on the side for dipping. A big hit at the New Years Eve party I attended this year. Thanks Vivian!",

I live in Thailand so bought a standard herb/spice pack with the onion ginger limes (no real \"lemons\" here in Thailand just imported - so limes give it more of a real Thai taste) chilies and lemon grass. Followed the recipe as-is but grated a bit of the Thai ginger in added one crushed clove of garlic and about 1/2 tsp salt. I let the mixture sit over night with 2 stalks of lemon grass stuck in for the flavour. Pull out the lemon grass before making into meat balls. I also baked as per other reviews. Delicious. My Thai friends loved them. Served with the left over sweet chili sauce to dip in as cocktail meatballs.",

For a healthier take we bake at 400 degrees for about 20-25 minutes flipping once in the middle of the bake time. We dip in sweet chili sauce or hotter chili garlic sauce. Our family loves them including our 4.5 and 2.5 year olds. Great with Peanut Butter Noodles recipe from this site that we add julienned cuke and carrot too for extra veggies.",

I did not need to add an egg as some reviewers have posted. My torpedoes stayed together fine. I drizzled some teriyaki sauce on it before and after i baked it as well. I baked it at 400 for about 20 minutes. Fantastic!",
