I looked into the pot and it had turned brown and the bottom of the instant pot was starting to turn black. The instructions said to give it 10 - 15 minutes. I'm thinking I should have lifted the pot out of the cooker after 2-3 minutes. But the instructions said nothing about that. I am waiting for it to cool all the way so I can taste it. I hope I can use it but have my doubts. Just tasted it! Mmmmm good. It taste nutty. With a little salt it would be wonderful!",
