Added 4 oz. of fresh, sliced mushrooms and a bit of thinly sliced yellow onion, as well as 1/2 tsp. of Hot Chinese Mustard.(Think Dijon would have worked well, too.) Steamed the squash for 6 min. to retain a vestige of vitamins. No salt or pepper. Shredded a little extra cheese on top, and baked @ 350 for 45 min., to match something else already in the oven. My husband and I both loved it. Will never turn down an offer for yellow squash from a gardener again!",

I use more cheese (usually at least 3 cups and I like to mix cheddar with Colby jack) to taste omit the wine and add onion. I usually steam the squash first but if I forget I just up the temp to about 400 and leave the lid for 30 minutes. I also add a topping of breadcrumbs mixed with spicy breader (fish batter) and a dash of olive oil.( 1/4 c each. stir until all topping is moist and crumbly and sprinkle over top) I add this after I take the lid off or about 20 minutes before it is done. I've used canned squash and I've also substituted with zucchini and it was great both ways! Our family favorite!",
