I had two huge chicken breasts so I added some to this recipe - a little soy squce, hawaiian marinade,  spice brown mustard,  and honey to stretch it out and add more kick.  I also sliced up the chicken breasts in about 1 inch strips to cook them faster.I am not a huge fan of balsamic vinegar so I wanted to mellow that flavor out some.  It turned out great!  We served it with mashed potatoes amd vegetables,  but it would be great with rice or pasta too.  Especially if you stretch the sauce.",
