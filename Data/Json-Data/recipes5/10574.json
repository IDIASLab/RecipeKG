                "reviewBody": "A very nice baguette recipe.  The dough was much looser (wetter) than I remember from culinary school, but it turned out great.  I doubled the yeast to half a teaspoon and got a nice rise in about 7 hours - still plenty of time to develop great flavor. I like the kind of baguette you almost break your teeth on with a thick hard crust - this recipe won't give you that but it's the best you'll get from a home oven.  Still a crisp and satisfying crust.  Don't trust any recipe with an egg wash if you want that crisp crust!\nHelpful Tip:  If you don't have a silpat silicone sheet you can do what I did and nest one sheet pan inside another equal sized pan, and this will insulate against over-browning (aka burning) on the bottom of the loaf.  Parchment paper is always your friend.  Otherwise an excellent recipe from Chef John.  Don't forget your imported french butter!",

I froze 2 loaves and let them thaw on the counter and then stuck them in a 350F oven for 5 minutes and they were just as good as the fresh baked ones.  The crust was crunchy and the inside was soft and full of holes for the butter to sink in.  This is now my go-to recipe for baguettes.  \n\nI was worried about the texture (sticky), but it came together beautifully!  So easy and so good.  I started the bread the night before and we had fresh bread for lunch and dinner. FYI, I did use unbleached flour, and I put a cast iron skillet on the bottom rack of the oven and threw a glass of water in the skillet right before putting my bread in the oven (more steam)those were the only changes.",

I typically make the dough into three small baguettes, but I've also used this method to make bread bowls and \"Boule\" loaves.  \n\nThree quick tips: \n\n1.  Use about 1/2 tsp. of yeast, rather than 1/4 tsp.  I have found this is the best amount for me.\n\n2.  I have found this works best if you can let this rest for at least 14 hours.  I really think this delivers the best result.\n\n3.  PUT SOMETHING NON-STICK ON YOUR PAN.  I can't emphasize this enough.  You will need an uncoated steel or aluminum baking sheet, and it is absolutely critical that you cover it with a silicon mat, parchment paper, or non-stick foil.  If you don't, you will NOT be able to get the loaves off without tearing them apart.  You have been warned...",
