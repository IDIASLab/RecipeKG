It was a little disappointing to sog up the beautiful crispy mushrooms but in the end the flavor was so good it didn't matter. I did a rough chop on the mushrooms to keep them in larger pieces. Next time I make this I might pull some of the mushrooms up and set them aside to use as garnish. This was so simple yet so elegant.",

I also added more Parmesan cheese when I plated, and more parsley, it had cooked down so much in the sauce that I thought it needed some fresh to finish it. Might try garlic next time, after reading some of the other reviews.",
