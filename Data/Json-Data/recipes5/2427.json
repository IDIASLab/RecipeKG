The balsamic gives them a bit of a sweet taste that I will tone down in my next try along with fine tuning the baking time for golden brussels sprouts. I do however have to admit that I used only 1/3 of the oil the recipe called for. My sprouts were little and were not exactly pretty so I had to clean them up so this made them even smaller. Other than that I guess use judgement on the amount of oil depending on the size of your sprouts. Will make it again as it goes VERY WELL WITH FILET MIGNON!",
