                "reviewBody": "There isn't enough liquid in this recipe, I followed the directions but the dough would  not form a ball and pull away from of the bowl, instead there were huge clumps. I added 1 tablespoon of olive oil and then 3 tablespoons of water, one at a time.  The other problem is that the edges of the sheets of pasta become brittle after laying on paper towels for 2-3 hours and won't go through the fettuccine cuter, I had to cut off an inch of each sheet. I think that this recipe is better suited to hand mixing and using a knife to cut the pasta, which is what I did at the end. The pasta is very silky when cooked, so I don't discourage others from trying this. Thanks for sharing.",
