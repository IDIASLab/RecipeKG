Because I needed my oven for other cooking projects, I put my precooked spiral ham in the crockpot, set it on low, and three hours later had a ham that was just-right sweet, tender, juicy.  The juice that collected made the best ham gravy; all I had to do was put it in a sauce pan, make a slurry of cornstarch and water, added it to the juices and cooked until thickened.  No other season required.  Perfect! This will be the way I make baked ham from now on.",

I put a small bit (about 5 oz) of soda (I used  Diet Sierra Mist) so it would not cook to the bottom.  I poked the ham all over and would from time to time using a baster, put the juice into the ham.  I used more than what was called for as far as the apricot jam (preserves)~ probably close to doubled it.  I also added about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of honey and about 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves.  I cooked it on high for about four hours, but it was done before that (but did not dry out at all).  My entire family loved it, my kids too~ dad even jumped online to get the recipe so he could save it!",
