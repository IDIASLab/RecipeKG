I've made other versions of chilli rellenos and either poblano or Anaheim chillies can be used.  It is not necessary to put the broiled chillies in boiling water and then ice water-although if you have house plants they will appreciate the water once you're done with it! Simply put in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap for about 5 minutes before peeling. I think any melting Mexican cheese can be used. If you can't find one try another. But it should probably be shredded as opposed to cut in chunks because the chillies cook so quickly the cheese doesn't have a chance to melt. And obviously have all the lovely Mexican condiments to accompany these babies!",

Secondly, I made this with traditional Mexican cheeses,, such as Asadero or Chihuahua, not Jack or any other American cheese. The other ingredients are good, and the recipe turned out well.  I also make chilis rellenos with a ground beef stuffing that contains ground beef, salt, pepper, a small amount of raisins and pine nuts, and a bit of Hatch Red Chili powder to provide a bit of bite, and an additional chili flavor.  The raisins add a touch of sweetness that I like. When preparing the chilis for stuffing, be sure to remove the seed pod attached to the stem end. I usually cut around the stem, and remove the pod through the slit I have made up the side of the chili for stuffing.",
