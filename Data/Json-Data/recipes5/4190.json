I cooked for 4 people so for the pasta, I used 10 ounces of pasta, 2 tsp. lemon juice, 1 cup parmesean, 1/4 tsp. each of oregano, basil, and cilantro.  When I drained the pasta, I reserved some of the pasta water just in case I wanted to add it, and I'm glad I did.  Once, I got all of the pasta, cheese, & herbs in the pan I decided that a little bit of the pasta water would give the pasta the exact consistency I was looking for.  I did not measure how much I used, but it was probably about 1 Tbls maybe 2.   I served this w/ broccoli as well.  We will have this again!!!!",
