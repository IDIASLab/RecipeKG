Skip this one a traditional alfredo sauce made with heavy whipping cream is far superior than using cream cheese. That was a mistake.",

Instead of mixing I sauteed the shrimp crab green onions garlic and lemon juice together with a little olive oil. I also added a few extra green onions to the mix and a little salt and pepper. I thought the sauce was excellent as well. I might put in a little less milk next time but the taste was wonderful and everyone I served had seconds. The only negative is that it is a time consuming process but well worth it if you're aiming to make an impressive flavorful meal. I am making this again tonight!",

Just remember that you never want to over-cook calamari. Fifteen minutes at most in a rather high oven completely covered with this sort of Alfredo sauce.",

But when it comes down to it they were a pain to stuff and didn't look that visually appealing in the end. I tried to work around the texture by just frying the assembled \"tubes\" and doing the sauce on the side. It still looked like a plate full of blown up balloons I was serving. My best advice is to do what I did in frying em up only bread em or toss through some flour/crumbs first to take away that texture and unnappealing appearance...",

I don't usually count calories if I want to eat delicious food but this is not the problem here it is simply too rich. Just think about the amount of butter and cream cheese it calls for too too rich. Cream cheese is not a good idea here. Be careful how long you keep it in the oven because calamari can get rubbery very quickly. I wouldn't cook it for more than 15 minutes. I will probably fix the calamari with the stuffing again but with another lighter sauce. Sorry I don't intend to be negative I'm just giving my honest opinion.",
