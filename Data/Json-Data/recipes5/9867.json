The  OP does mean 2 minutes and then leave the release pressure alone for 15 minutes. ( Which means do not release the air ). I did mine for 5 minutes on high pressure, and 10 minutes natural release. The meat was perfect! I think we will all add a pinch of salt for taste depending on the curry paste and milk used. I had to add a little to mine but wait till the end to do this.  Highly recommend this recipe, it will be my go to now and of course my base recipe, I may tweak it where desired! \n\nSo, I have no photo as the pot was licked clean before I got to my plate of FOOD! Next dish I will try to upload a photo, oh and I added a few tablespoons of heavy whipping cream, I like my sauce to be a little thicker. But, it looked fine prior to doing this.\n\nTasha S.",

I used about 2.5 lbs of chicken breast so I probably could have gone even higher with the seasoning but then it would have been too spicy for my husband.  Doubling the seasonings was plenty flavorful for us! I also added a little salt and pepper to the chicken before cooking it. Additional adjustments I made included using 3.5 tbsp of red curry, 1 tbsp chili garlic sauce, 2 tbsp fish sauce, and 2 tbsp coconut sugar instead of palm sugar (didn't have it at the grocery store)",
