First off I doubled the recipe then did 3/4 brown sugar 1 1/2 c. ketchup and then added 2 T. molasses. I also only put in 1/2 an onion instead of 2. I think next time I'll cut them up really small instead of slicing. We put them on ribs tonight & it was soooo good! Thank you Irene!",

The entire two cups were used on one slab of baby back ribs and we all wished that we had more for dipping. I will probably double the recipe the next time I make this. FYI: I like to read reviews and often apply reviewer suggestions when I make a recipe I find here. For this recipe I left out the vegetable oil (as suggested) used dried minced onion in place of fresh (since I don't like a strong onion flavor or texture) added 1 tsp of chopped garlic (as suggested) and substituted apple cider vinegar for white vinegar as suggested and due to personal preference). I will definitely be making this again! Thank you BOBEVERLY.",
