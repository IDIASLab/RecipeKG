I was prepared to make spaghetti for my husband's dinner when unexpectedly he had to pick up a friend at the airport coming in from Jordan. A quick search on here brought me to this recipe that I thought I could use as a base for a spaghetti sauce with a middle eastern flair. The sauce is great; am sure it is great with beans. I made the meatballs from the 'Kafta(bbq)' recipe on here and it was great!!! Only changes besides the beans was adding more cumin and 2 bay leafs. I also didn't have a can of beef broth so had some turkey broth in the fridge and subbed that instead. Also a couple of chopped roma tomatoes. I will try it with the beans next time. The sauce alone is great.",
