I used precut Date Nuggets and countered their dryness by using a few more tablespoons of rum. The apricots weren't bad to cut up. Then in the AM I put half the mixture at a time in a food processor and pulsed it a few times so the fruit was more evenly sized and ultimately easier to slice cleanly into rounds. I also baked them a bit longer. The end result was a huge hit...not sweet and a good addition to a cookie plate",
