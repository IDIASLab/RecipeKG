If you don't have much \"sauce\" after baking either reduce the veggies or increase the sauce. Reducing cooking time also may help. I double the sauce and use a 1.5 qt casserole dish. If you didn't like my dish before please try it again using my suggestions. Please do not substitute the vegetables and then give my recipe a bad review that is comparing apples to oranges.",
