I mixed in Montreal steak seasoning with the lemon juice & a little water & marinated pork steaks for about 4 hrs. Then I poured off the marinade & mixed in the butter & brought it to a boil & then basted the pork steaks as recipe suggests. I fixed them in the broiler & they were delicious. Would have given a four but as stated as is I think the recipe is bland.",

And it was easy to make - you didn't have to plan ahead to marinate. Definitely a keeper. I actually made extra of the butter mixture to use as a sauce for the side dish (couscous or rice.)",

I marinated them for a few hours adding some black pepper and Adobo seasoning to the marinade and grilled them on my mini indoor grill. I just seared each side on high heat every other minute while basting the other side as recommended and kept a very close eye on it - you definitely have to do that on an indoor grill especially if you use tender boneless chops like I did. The boyfriend and I really liked the flavor; we're always looking for healthy and tasty recipes. I'll make it again thanks!",
