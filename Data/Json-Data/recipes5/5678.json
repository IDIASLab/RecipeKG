I did cook the shredded carrots a bit once the beef was browned and let the hot beef mixture wilt the cabbage a bit before serving to make it more kid friendly.

We did not care for this with the ground beef, but I as inspired by the ingredients to put something else together.  I too  used Napa Cabbage. I also used shredded carrots and a small bag of Brocolli Slaw mix from the grocery.  I shredded a whole head of cabbage, a whole head of iceberg, added 2 large shredded carrots, and the whole bag of brocolli slaw.  I put all of this in a huge Tupperware bowl and tossed it.  That way it's ready to grab and put in a bowl for dinner or to take in a smaller covered bowl for lunches.  Do not add the dressing til you are ready to eat it! I had angel hair pasta, so cooked some of that, ran under cold water and added to the salad at serving time along w/ sliced deli rare roast beef.  Also dropped on 1/2 oz sliced almonds and dried cranberries last night for dinner.  Having it again tonite with mandarine oranges.  IT's AWESOME not to have to cook and this is the first main dish salad that hubby (midwest meat-eater) actually complimented me on.  Adding to the regular weekly menue for the summer in Phoenix!",

I couldn't find napa cabbage at my local grocery store so I used the pre shredded cole slaw mix. It worked great but when I can find napa I will try that. Only thing I wasn't sure of was if it was to be served cold or hot. I know it's a salad but I tried it both ways and liked them both. I will make this again soon! Thx KKH3!",

We love the classic asian cabbage salad but wanted something along the same lines, but different. This had that tangy fresh crunch of the cabbage, but the beef and pasta gave it a chewy and hearty texture. I used a cole slaw mix for the cabbage and carrot combo, which made the recipe very easy. Great for a summer evening, we will definitely make this again- thanks for the recipe!",

I had some leftover grilled london broil slices I needed to use so I used that instead of the ground beef (cut into small pieces). I also used a whole pound of pasta. Because of the extra pasta I had to double the dressing (except I only used 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes). Wow. That dressing is addictive. I think any Asian noodle dish with this dressing would be wonderful. The salad itself is adaptable I think although I did enjoy the Napa cabbage carrot and green onion mix. Will definitely use this again maybe with chicken sometime too.",
