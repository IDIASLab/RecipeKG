The ingredients lists 2 cups of milk, while the directions state to fill only one can 3/4 full. I did that first, and it was way too thick. I ended up adding probably 2 cups total to get a good consistency. I ended up adding a big scoop of sour cream to try and give the sauce a little more flavor.",
