Only changes were to cook the quinoa in homemade vegetable stock and I blanched the broccoli slightly (tossed some in with the quinoa for maybe the last five minutes of cooking time).  I'm not even a big tarragon fan, but the flavor of the tarragon, garlic, lemon and mustard blend together perfectly in this dish.  I actually had some of this while still warm and it would make a fabulous side dish or light meal, as well as a salad! Thank  you jjane123! This one's a keeper!",

I chopped the broccoli into tiny pieces (about dime-sized) and I threw it into the cooking quinoa for the last 3 minutes so it would soften slightly and get a nice bright green color. I also used about 1.5-2 cups of broccoli because 3/4 cup just wasn't enough. While the quinoa was cooking I whisked the rest of the ingredients (minus the beans) together in a bowl. Once the quinoa and broccoli was cooked I tossed in the beans and \"dressing\" and voila! Perfection! I will definitely make this one again!",
