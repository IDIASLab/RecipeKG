It was even unusual to use an 8x8 instead of a 9x5 loaf pan (I used a Pyrex dish). I made it pretty much exactly as written using a good-sized white onion. In my case 1 hour of baking left it slightly underdone in the center so I should have opted for using a meat thermometer as suggested. Also it was a little weird that there was a good amount of water (not fat although there was a little of that too) in the bottom of the dish - I was surprised it didn't evaporate away. But the meatloaf itself was tasty and held together pretty well despite the lack of breadcrumbs/egg/etc. It lasted me for three pretty big dinners' worth.",
