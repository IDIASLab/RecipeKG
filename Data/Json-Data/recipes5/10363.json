This recipe is super easy to make and require \"normal\" ingredients - most of which are standard in my pantry/spice rack.  For personal taste, I did add a little more Old Bay, red pepper and green onions and it came out moist, tasty, and the ingredients do not overpower the buttery sweet crab flavor (btw, I used the 16 oz blue lump crab from CostCo). One critic mentioned that they had a problem with them falling apart - I did not experience that at all.  You will need to allow a few minutes for the crab cakes to stand, and as you can tell by the picture, they held together wonderfully.  Other's mentioned having a problem forming the cakes - Try sprinkling a little bread crumbs in your hand as you start rolling them. Also, don't let your butter get too hot or it will brown too fast and remember that the quality of your crabcakes will depend on the qaulity of lump crab. These crab cakes are very \"meaty\" and not too bready, which is what I was hoping for. I made 5 crab cakes and they were a sufficient size.  Next time I'll try crab balls so they's go a little further.\nMy husband was very impressed and is still talking about them.  Hmmm, these things are so good they can be used as a tool for manipulation\u2026or to put a smile on your honey\u2019s face!  Enoy!",

My only suggestions are to add a tablespoon of fresh minced parsley and to eliminate coating the cakes in the bread crumbs before frying. These crab cakes are delicious with fresh corn on the cob, sliced tomatoes and a potato salad.  Oh yeah, a cold brew or two. If any are left over (rare) they are delicious cold on saltine crackers.",

I had no problem forming the patties, as mentioned on Chef John\u2019s video, and mine seemed to stay together quite well.  I served these atop a salad of mixed greens, green onions, toasted almonds and feta, along with a balsamic vinaigrette.

                "reviewBody": "I only use 4 to 6 crackers and if you broil, you don't need the bread crumbs.  I brush aluminum covered pan with olive oil and broil your crab cakes 2nd step down from broiler in 500 degree oven for 10 minutes.  No need to flip as the oil will brown the bottom. I also don't use all that slurry...just enough to hold the crab meat together.  I also use jumbo lump crab meat from the Chesapeake Bay as that is where I live.  Also, be gentle with the lump crab meat in order to keep the lumps.  I don't add salt either as the first ingredient in Old Bay is celery salt.  You can also be adventurous and add a tablespoon or two of finely minced green or red bell pepper,jalapeno, and/or onion.  This changes it up just a bit and still very good.",
