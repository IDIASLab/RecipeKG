        "description": "Ever go to an Indian restaurant and wonder how they make those lentils? I hated lentils before I discovered Indian food. Then I scoured the internet to figure out how they achieved them, and through mixing and matching recipes and methods on videos, I've arrived at this recipe, which I think is pretty close. This version is very rich, but you can leave out the cream to make it lighter. Kasuri methi (fenugreek leaves) is almost impossible to find in the U.S., even in NYC, but it gives this dish something very special.",

It's absolutely delicious!!!  In fact my husband loved it so much he had leftover dal and brown rice for breakfast this morning, lol!\nI did make some minor changes to the recipe.  Instead of 2 Tbsp salt, I only added 1 tsp of salt and it was plenty enough, I may consider adding even less the next time I make it.  Also, in place of the butter and heavy cream, I used 2 Tbsp trans-fat free margarine and fat-free half and half.  And lastly, SOGOLONDJATA is right, fenugreek leaves are close to impossible to find state side.  I added 1 Tbsp fenugreek seeds in place of the leaves; the flavor is much more intense in the seeds, but they are much easier to find in an Indian spice market.  \nBe sure to remove the bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon (I left it whole; its easier to fetch out) and black cardamom before eating, especially if your serving to children.  Another thought ~ after toasting the spices, it would be fairly easy to wrap them in cheese cloth.\nThank you so very much for posting this recipe.",

I made the recipe for 6 people and it called for 2 tablespoons of salt but change that to 2 teaspoons and you'll be fine. I also used canned kidney beans instead of dry so if you go my way be sure to drain the excess water after cooking the lentils and beans or you'll end up with dal makhani soup.",

I also used ghee instead of butter, which is the magic answer for me.  Get it at Indian grocers, Trader Joe's, or make some clarified butter yourself.  It's worth it.

The dish smelled and looked amazing and was absolutely delicious except for the extreme saltiness. Unfortunately I couldn't fix the doubled recipe and decided to dump the entire thing out. Will definitely try again some time soon with MUCH less salt - and will probably use kosher instead or regular salt.

I didn't have any kidney beans, so I just used a few more lentils.  Also, I took note of another reviewer and added in one diced yellow onion that I browned and cooked with the cumin seeds.  \nOverall, I have a feeling that this will be a weekly favorite in my household.  It's very easy with tons of dynamic flavor.  Thanks for the new family favorite!",
