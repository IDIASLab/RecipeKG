I had to add a considerable amount of additional broth and vinegar so the potatoes were not dried out. I asked my husband to taste after I'd finally mixed all up and at that point he said to add more vinegar. When I next make this I also think I would use bolder apple cider vinegar maybe just a taste preference for us. And by means do add the \"optional\" bacon I think it's very important to the flavor of this dish. Served this evening with good old-fashioned grilled German bratwursts. Enjoyed and i would make again.",

Based on the previous review I was concerned w/it being to dry so i increased the liquid ingredients. I didn't need to; it would have been fine as written; I even ended up draining a bit of the liquid this morning. I rinsed my potatoes with cold water to stop the cooking process so perhaps this prevented a little of the soakage. My fresh dill had gone bad so I ended up subbing dried and it worked fine (though I'm sure fresh would be even better). I think the optional bacon is a must. I nuked it crumbled it and added it at service so it remained crispy. THANKS for the recipe!",
