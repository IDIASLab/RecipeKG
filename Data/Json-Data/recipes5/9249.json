The recipe is a snap to put together and SUPER tasty - many proclaimed they were \"addicted\".  Be sure the bread is nice and toasty from the oven as the crunch is a nice counterpoint to the super sweetness of the grapes. I'd bought grapes that were already sweet so couldn't imagine they'd change  after cooking. WRONG! After roasted, they developed another more complex dimension of sweetness. Forgot the glaze but NP, and could've upped both the herbs and ricotta (had lots of holes in the French bread & needed more ricotta to 'plug' them up for the grape topping.)  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",
