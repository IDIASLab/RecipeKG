                "reviewBody": "We liked this quite a bit. It would have been a 5 star recipe for us if the sweet and sour flavor would have infused into the pork more. I would imagine that marinating the pork in the sauce overnight would help but that would have defeated the purpose of a quick and easy meal for me! Also I cubed my chops into about 1\" cubes. I think I'll make them smaller next time. I did make a few changes to the recipe. Some due to lack of ingredients on hand and others due to flavor. I didn't have any carrots or celery so I just omitted them. I will add them when I make this again. I also left out the sherry wine for the same reason though the sauce was great as-is so I don't think I'll add it in the future. The biggest change I did was subbing a 8 oz. can of tomato sauce for the tomato paste. I compensated for the extra liquid by adding quite a bit more cornstarch. I added 1 tbsp. to the original sauce instead of the 1 tsp. that was called for and then about 1/2 hour before it was done I added an additional 2 tbsp. (which I mixed with some of the sauce before adding)to get it to a nice and thick consistancy. I also think that if I would have used the tomato paste we would not have liked the sauce as much. It had a good balance of flavor using the tomato sauce and I think we would have thought the paste would make it to \"tomato-ey\". As for flavor changes I upped the garlic to 1 tsp. and the same with the minced ginger. Thanks for the recipe. It was nice to have",
