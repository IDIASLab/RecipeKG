For those hardcore whiskey drinkers who are thinking along the lines of \"a real whiskey drinker wouldn't add the mix ice etc\". Fair enough. I like mine neat also but let's be honest: the ice and lemon tang really does go well on a hot afternoon! I gave this recipe a go with my rye whiskey fave Forty Creek. The 5 oz did seem high for a recipe. It's more than double of any others I surfed up. But you know what? It's superb. I think you'd want to cut 'er down to two or three for those that don't like the booze to take center stage. I'm gonna hang with this one on hot summer days. Cheers.",

I call it whiskey with training wheels for those who have not learned to drink real whiskey. Bushmills and Gentleman Jack are not bourbons at all. Yes a whiskey sour is a strong drink, and those who are not up to it should drink something else rather than dilute it with (yech!) Sprite.
