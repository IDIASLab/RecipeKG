If you don't have one of these handy \"stick\" blenders, I strongly suggest you invest in one.  It's much easier to use and clean than a regular blender for this type of application.  You can control how thick you want the soup to be by the amount of time you blend the soup, and you do it right in the same pot!  What could be easier than that?",

All in all a scrumptious hearty soup! Also I think because of the bacon it doesn't need a lot of extra salt-- just be wary with that shaking hand!",

I cut down to two pieces of bacon used a little olive oil added a green pepper with the onion 3 cups of chicken broth instead of 2 1 can of water 2 garlic cloves instead of 3 immersion blender (as mentioned in another review) and as little corn starch at the end to thicken it up a bit. AMAZING. A little bit of rice in the bowl then added the soup....delicious! Next time I will take out 1/2 or 1/3 the beans before I use the immersion blender then replace the beans into the soup puree. That way there's a little more bean texture. Great recipe nonetheless",
