We were disappointed that they weren\u2019t more \u201coaty\".  So the next time I used old-fashioned oats and only soaked them as long as it took me to get the rest of the ingredients together (about half an hour) which gave them a chewier texture and an \u201coaty\u201d flavor he really likes.  As suggested by other reviewers I added spices- 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  The store was out of buttermilk so I used regular with a Tablespoon of vinegar.  They turned out wonderfully.",

I made these muffins for my 10 month old daughter and very picky 3 year old son and they LOVED them. I used white flour because I was out of wheat I used organic no sugar added applesauce I decreased the brown sugar to about 1/4 of a cup packed and then loaded the batter with fresh ripe good quality blueberries. I made mini muffins and each muffin has 3 to 4 big blueberries in it. They were perfect for little ones. If you are having trouble with this recipe try weighing the flour. Once I started weighing my flour to measure all my recipes come out perfect. Since these muffins have very little fat you have to grease the pan completely or they will stick. Also if you are looking for full flavor and sweet this is not the recipe for you. You can add spices and more sugar as suggested if you want that.",

In separate bowl mix together: 1c applesauce 1/2c 1% milk 1/2c brown sugar 1/4c of canola oil (or extra applesauce but I used the oil) 1 egg. Add wet ingredients to dry ones. Then to the mix I added almond slivers and 2/3c of dried cranberries. Before baking lightly top each muffin with a mixture of 2/3c oats 3 tbsp brown sugar 2 tbsp applesauce 1 tsp cinnamon. Spray mini-muffin pan in dark pan bake at 350 degrees for 16-18 minutes. Makes 3 dozen mini-muffins. Each mini is about 85 calories most are from fiber and grains but you can cut this number back substantially by using applesauce instead of oil.",

Instead of buttermilk I used plain yogurt with a little bit of peach yogurt (I can't find buttermilk in any supermarket in Chile but plain yogurt works as a great substitute).
