I think the crushed garlic is what really enhances this dish and should not be skipped or substituted!  Pan heat and timing is also important so be sure to have everything pretty much ready and you won\u2019t be disappointed. While good without protein; I did saut\u00e9 3 pork loins steaks (cubes) separately and seasoned with Italian seasoning and oregano.  Added the pork when I added the Romano & Basil for the dish\u2019s final \u201cstir.\u201d Shrimp would also be a nice add. Served with breadsticks. Delish! Thank you!",

I did nto have Campanelle pasta so used linguini and it was good! With a few pieces of bacon, pancetta, or prociutto you can make this place a bit savory and with that extra protein kick! Will make it again!",
