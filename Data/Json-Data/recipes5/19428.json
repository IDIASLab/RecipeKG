I did not have any spicy mustard so I just mixed together a little regular yellow mustard with a smidgen of cayenne pepper. I substituted red wine vinegar for the cider vinegar as that's all I had in my pantry and that worked out just fine. I was also able to cut the recipe in half since I was only making a small ham. It did require a lot of stirring to get rid of the clumps of mustard and brown sugar that formed but other than that it was quite simple and easy. The glaze had an apple-like flavor and was somewhat smokey with just a little bit of spiciness. It was very tasty indeed! I was able to take the glaze that pooled up around the bottom of the ham in the roasting pan pour it into a small dish and use it a as nice sauce to dip the pieces of ham on my fork in. It complemented the ham beautifully! Delicious! A very good recipe. I highly recommend it.",
