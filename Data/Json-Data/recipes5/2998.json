I was not let down this has a fabulous flavor. One drawback to using milk instead of mayo is the consistency. The dressing was a little runny. I also went a little overboard on the anchovies. To remedy two problems with one solution I grated some parmesan cheese in. Wonderful and easy a new favorite!",

I orginally omitted the salt per one of the reviews but ended up adding some salt to taste as the anchovy paste i bought was not very salty. This is keeper! Im glad I doubled the recipe! next time i may add some parmesan or something to thicken but the taste is there! Thank You Rinnie!",
