I minced the garlic and mixed with the other ingredients (no food processesor necessary, imo). I subbed fresh thyme for tarragon, as I did not have any fresh tarragon. I think fresh dill would be great, too. I ended up baking at 400 for abut ten minutes, according to a similar recipe, and it worked out fine, although, I will broil next time for the added browning effect of the topping. I would definitely try this technique with other fish, too.",

Our salmon steak was quite a bit thicker than the 8 oz so we more than doubled the cooking time before the fish was flaking. As far as taste both our picky 4 YO and our autistic 8 YO loved it eating more than an adult serving each. We combined it with a spinach salad with vinegar and olive oil dressing along with some left over potato salad. I accompanied my dinner with some merlot that our neighbor had to get rid of before it went bad. Over all a \"perfecto\" dinner as my daughter put it.",
