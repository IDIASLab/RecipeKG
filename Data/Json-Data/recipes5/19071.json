I also cut the oil back to 25 percent and introduced one-third whole wheat flour.  The results are in; it's even better than the original! I like to use the huge zucchini that didn't get picked on time, as long as it's still green and healthy.  This is a large batch recipe, but you can easily cut it in half.",

I used 4 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour (which doesn't even come close to regular whole wheat flour in texture it is much smoother and softer) and 1 cup soymilk in addition because anything whole wheat needs more moisture. I omitted all white flour. Because whole wheat flour is more dense than white it is preferable to use less when substituting completely. I used only 3 eggs and might even use 2 next time. 6 are really unnecessary. I also used raw sugar instead of brown in the same amount only adding 1 tablespoon molasses to mimic the brown sugar flavour and moisture. Raw sugar is much healthier for you. I made 21 muffins out of these. Nice big plump ones. They are succulent. The kind you would pay for. Just make sure you use pastry flour because regular flour will make them rock hard if you want them 100% whole wheat.",

I thought the sweetness of the bread was right on and in fact, cut the brown sugar down to only 1/2 cup. To save on calories, I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil and then just added 2 tablespoons of oil. I love spice so I also snuck in some nutmeg. Since it makes three loaves, it's been fun giving it away to friends and family and so far, people have loved it and have been asking me for the recipe! ",

I ended up with a bunch of bowls that wouldn't fit the entire thing to the end. Since you are baking 3 loaves at once it gets hard to stir in the end so I used yet another bowl and threw it in my Kitchenaid. Maybe I am a weakling but then again that's what I bought that. So can't say it never gets used:) The bread was done probably around 40-45 minutes but I didn't take it out til the timer said at 50 - so note for next time. Also - even though there is honey and brown sugar this isn't a sweet bread. It's good just not sweet. So if you want some more sweetness in it I would replace it with regular sugar.",
