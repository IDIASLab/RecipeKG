I made it to take to a wine party and it was well received! My friends were dipping EVERYTHING in this including sausage! I didn't have basil so I omitted it. I diced the onions because I figured people wouldn't want big pieces of onions when dipping and it was the perfect consistency. I tried the onions after caramelizing them and they were fabulous! You could use just the onions to top steaks or veggies or whatever you wanted to put onions on/add onions to! The goat cheese gave a good creamy consistency but since I will be making this for a lot of people I think I am going to sub cream cheese for the goat cheese and use a mixer to briefly blend the sour cream and cream cheese.",
