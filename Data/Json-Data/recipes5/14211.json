Well, here's a recipe that revitalizes your fresh veggies by steeping them in a vinegar and water solution. This is a combination of several different recipes for Asian-style cucumber salads. I like to pour it over a salad, but you could just pick out the veggies and them solo. Use any veggies you like -- I've chosen the ones I most often have waiting around!",

It will be too wet and probably too tangy if you attempt to eat it just like it's written. It needs to be eaten on a bed of lettuce of some sort. This is written to be quite spicy (1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper) so if that doesn't suit your needs, feel free to change it, but don't add it if you don't already know you like that much spice, because it will ruin it for you. Use real sugar if you prefer, but you may need to use more as Splenda is sweeter than sugar (to my tastes anyway). (P.S.--it is forcing me to put a star rating, it won't let me just go unrated.)",

I have tried a bunch of pickled salads on this site including slaws, cucumber salads, etc. and this one is by far my favorite. The only real change I made is that I used sugar instead of the artificial sweetener because I didn't have any but we don't like things overly sweet so it worked out good for us. I left out the optional yellow bell because hubby doesn't like them and for the optional white sliced onion I used a red that had already been chopped and needed used. I served it over a bed of baby spinach leaves and it was the perfect salad. So light and crunchy and the flavor combo was excellent. Thank you Jarrie!",
