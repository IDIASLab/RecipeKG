This could be why the ratings are on opposite ends of the scale.  I have used Crown because the dish come out tasting great, and I take pride in my culinary creations.  I have also used Jameson and gotten excellent results.  If Old Crow brand is chosen, even if it is their best 7 day old, I cannot vouch for the results.  ;-)  Happy Day!",

I let the chicken sit in the marinade for about 5 hrs in the fridge. I really wanted to grill the chicken and then cook down the rest of the marinade for a dipping sauce......but couldn't get the grill to turn on! Either way the family loved it and the chicken was juicy. I will try again with the grill next time and update later. Thanks Wolf for an awesome recipe!: )",
