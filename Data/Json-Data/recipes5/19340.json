I had to leave it in for more than 45 minutes- don't worry about it getting brown on top that's how it should be. You need to make sure that the pie is not jiggly before you pull it out of the oven! I used a graham cracker crust and soy milk and it turned out AMAZING! Will definitely be making this again.",

Generally pies in this take 10-15 minutes but this one took 20 the caramel rose into the top plate and it was very hard to clean because of the stickiness but it was delicious and I will make it again this time in a regular oven. I didn't have any brown sugar on hand but a mix of regular sugar and molasses works just as well. I recommend using a non-sugary pie dough recipe as the caramel is already very sweet. Also it will look almost burnt when it is done this is normal.",

This turned out like the recipe I remember from my childhood - with a lovely creamy caramel middle and a spongy top layer. I made as written but found the directions needed a bit more detail. Definitely need to thoroughly combine the egg yolks brown sugar flour and butter before adding the milk. Otherwise the butter clumps from the cold milk and won t combine. This happened to me and I had to dump it and start again. Also for my egg whites I added a pinch of salt to stablize after they started getting foamy and then whipped to firm peaks before folding them in. The rest of the directions worked well for me and it was delicious!",
