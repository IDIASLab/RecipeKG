I lean towards the spicy side but the flavor was so good I didn't bother to add hot sauce or jalapenos as I originally thought I might. Also didn't bother with the cheese it's that good.

I cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces prior to cooking with the onions. Later I skipped the shredding of the chicken. I used Old El Paso brand hot & spicy taco seasoning. Instead of picante sauce I used a medium heat locally made salsa. Picante and salsa are made with the same ingredients with salsa being a little chunkier. I then cooked the ingredients for 4 hours on low in the slow cooker. After one taste my wife commented that this is now one of her favorite soups. This soup had so much flavor that we did not feel the need for topping with cheese. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.",
