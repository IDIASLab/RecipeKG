These definitely passed that test. I found one under my pillow!  I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup and used about 3 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter. Also threw in about 3/4 cup of rolled oats to give them some depth. I rolled them about to about 1/2 inch thickness and cut them out using dog bone and various mini christmas cookie cutters. Baked them for about 35 minutes. Awesome recipe, will make again and again. EDIT: I've been making these for 4 years now and they are loved by my dogs, as well as neighborhood hounds, family members; dogs, and friends' pooches!",

Treat this recipe as pie dough - put everything but the water in your stand mixer bowl (I hope you have one - it works wonders!) and mix, then add water a TBSP at a time until the dough pulls together and is \"workable.\"  Then, dump the dough out and roll it.  I didn't need to add more pumpkin or peanut butter or anything - this was a very easy recipe.  (I forgot to add the salt, but I don't think the dog minded!)  I cut the dough into tiny Christmas shapes before baking.  I think I need to play around with the baking temps and times, because like my first dog biscuit attempt, I couldn't get these do be totally 100% dry and crunchy.  Mind you, the dog still loved them and treated them like \"special treats,\" taking them to another room to enjoy.",

I don't put salt in anything, and the dogs didn't miss it.\n\nI used my stand mixer and added small amounts of water, as suggested.  I needed to flour the board well to keep it from sticking, but it otherwise was easy to cut with cookie cutters (WalMart has a nice set in the cake designing section that consists of a dog bone, a dog and a paw print.\n\nThey smell awesome, too.  I put two bags in the freezer, where they kept beautifully and came out just as well as the portion I didn't freeze.  Better than anything I've purchased commercially and much cheaper, too.",

If you give them a pumpkin cookie before bed time you are guaranteed to have an easy 'walk' first thing in the morning.  There are a few things that I tend to do differently.  I use stone ground whole wheat flour.  I had a bag that I never used because it was too course, but it is great for the dog treats, my dogs prefer it.    Also I open a big can of pumpkin and use half of it in this recipe (a little over a cup) and the other half in human treats (pumpkin-spice cupcakes).  And finally, for training treats, and this takes a little practice, keep adding flour 1/2 cup at a time while blending with your electric beater.  When the batter goes to a popcorn-like consistency pull out the bite size pieces and put on your cookie sheet.  You have to ball up the rest yourself or you can roll it out and cut it like the recipe calls for.  I haven't bought training size treats since I found this recipe!",
