Harris Teeter also has precooked packages of grilled chicken that made this recipe even easier. I am thinking about trying to add lemon zest next time.

I also ran a bit short on the dressing so keep that in mind. one downside (and there's no way to avoid it) is that it doesn't refrigerate that well... it's fine for a day or two but the penne really soaks up the dressing and it can get a little dry. just keep that in mind because this makes a lot of yummy salad!",
