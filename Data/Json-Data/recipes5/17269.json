When I told my husband we were having steak tonight he told me to use \"that marinade you used a couple weeks ago\". Awesome! It was good using the original recipe but tonight I played around with it to make it my own. I added 1/2 tsp more garlic (using garlic powder since I don't have any fresh garlic) 1/2 tsp ginger a squeeze of lime juice a dash of pepper a dash of onion powder a tsp of worcestershire sauce a dash of pineapple juice a tablespoon of cornstarch for thickening and a dash of Franks red hot sauce.

Add a tablesppon or so of cornstartch and mix very well till all clumps are disovled and then coat whatever you want to marinade.
