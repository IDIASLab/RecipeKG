My submitted recipe called for 1/4 cup lemon juice- I let AR know about it an they corrected the recipe!  I recommend tossing the pesto with hot pasta so the cheese sort of melts and coats each strand.  You might want to reserve a ladle or two of hot pasta water so you can add a little while tossing if you want a saucier dish.",

This recipe definitely has potential but as is the garlic is very overpowering. It was even more potent today when I reheated it for lunch. I had a couple of people walk into the lunchroom at work and ask what was in the microwave. Don't get me wrong this is delicious otherwise. I will definitely make this again but with half the amount of garlic. I really liked the addition of the walnuts. A nice twist on traditional pesto. This would be delicious with chicken or shrimp as an added protein to make it a complete meal.",
