This has to be some horrible mistype on amount. 2 Tbsp is just entirely too much. 2) Soaking the rice for 30 minutes is too long. This causes the rice to be too brittle. It should be soaked for around 10 mins. 3) Simmering frozen vegetables for 20 minutes turns them into mush. 20 minutes would probably be fine for fresh. I'll shoot to find another recipe.",

I follow the Weight Watchers program and it comes to just 4.5 pts per serving if you use a reduced-fat margerine instead of butter. The recipe is good even without the butter at all too! I recommend using 2 c. of fresh veggies instead of just 1. I used chopped fresh broccoli mushrooms and shredded carrots. Cauliflower and peas would also be very tasty in this! Be careful with the cloves... I do not recommend using the entire 1/2 tsp. They are very strong and you also might not want to bite into them! Also - the recipe does not specify whether the 1 c. rice should be 1 c. cooked or not cooked... I used 1 c. uncooked and it yielded about 2-3 c. cooked. This was a perfect amount so I think that's what the recipe-poster meant. Also I made mine in the microwave rather than the soaking and mine turned out excellent. For an extra 2 pts vanilla or mango yogurt is an excellent complimentary side-dish to this spicy dish. Enjoy!",

I used fresh veggies for the most part in this as I did not have frozen mixed vegetables. I used one small potato 1/2 red pepper 1/2 a zucchini 1/2 jalape\u00f1o pepper 1 1/2 handfuls of baby carrots (chopped). I used 1/2 a cup of frozen peas and a handful of frozen corn. After the onions cooked I added in the potatoes cooked them for a few mins added in the carrots and jalapeno cooked that for a few mins added in the rice cooked that. Then added in the water rest of the veggies and the spices and about a tablespoon of raisins. It tasted very good when finished I ate it with a baby spinach salad (that had red onions and grape tomatoes in it) that had the \"creamy cucumber dressing\" from this site. I usually like a yogurt/raita with my Indian rice dishes the dressing did double duty in that respect. The meal was enjoyable and easy to make!",
