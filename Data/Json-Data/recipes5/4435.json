I first salted each piece of eggplant, let it sit for 30 minutes, drained and then rinsed each piece with water. This allows it to lose a lot of moisture so that the roasting gives it a very nice texture and consistency. Then I added basil, oregano and garlic powder to spice it up so that I can serve this with pasta and sauce. It is a delightful alternative to eggplant parm, and a lot healthier!",

                "reviewBody": "1. This is a very good basic recipe for roasted eggplant, and you can pretty much change the seasonings at will to match whatever you may wish to eat the eggplant with. I've tended to leave it at salt, pepper, and basil and it comes out terrific every time.    2. As other reviewers have mentioned, salting the eggplant first and then letting it sit to drain is a *must* for this recipe. Not only does it take out some of the moisture to improve the texture for roasting, but it also cuts the bitterness of the eggplant. I've tried it both ways; salting, draining, rinsing, and drying the eggplant beforehand gives a *much* tastier and better textured end product.    3. When you roast the eggplant at this temp/time, the cut surfaces get nice and crispy and the insides turn beautifully tender. If you like the crispy outer texture that roasted vegetables can sometimes get, cut the eggplant into smaller pieces (say, eighths instead of the quarters it calls for in the recipe) to maximize the surface area.",

I then rinsed them and put them between paper towels. I lined a cookie sheet with foil and sprayed with Pam, placed the eggplant slices on and brushed with a mix of olive oil and crushed garlic and sprinkled with salt & pepper. I think the sweating part makes a huge difference. The outside of the eggplant was crispy and browned while the inside was tender. Very simple and healthy recipe. Will make again!",
