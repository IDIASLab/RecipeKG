I have an instant pot so I throw a frozen chicken breast on my trivet and cook at high pressure and high heat for 30 minutes till done.  Then I pull out my KitchenAid, either my stand mixer or hand-held one whichever one suits my fancy that day, then beat the  out of the chicken to make it shredded.  I like the shredded chicken texture better than chunks.  Also, always use Duke\u2019s Mayonnaise, it takes this recipe to the next level when you have a good Mayonnaise.",

Step #2 seemed strange in that the cumin and chili powder are added after the cooking process and would be eaten raw.  I have never heard of this so I did some research and found an NPR story from 2013 where ground and/or dried spices may contain salmonella and it was advised to cook these spices to destroy the virus/bacteria.  I would suggest that the recipe have a disclaimer or change to warn potential cooks.",

I used about 1/4-1/2 tsp of Goya Adobo seasoning instead of the salt (Goya Adobo seasoning is a Mexican season salt available at most grocery stores).  I also added a cubed avocado.  I could tell from reading the recipe that it would be good, but the flavors really come together well.  A nice update to regular chicken salad, will definitely make it again.",
