I used 1 T. of cornstarch mixed with 1/4 c. of the broth to thicken it up and then added the noodles about an hour later. I didn't remove anything before adding the noodles either. It turned out like a thick flavorful chicken noodle stew. I will add more veggies next time just to get those daily servings in. Also I only used 2 chicken breasts (it's what we had in the house) and there was still a lot of chicken. Thanks for sharing the recipe Kathy.",

I took many reviewer recommendations including celery salt a couple of bay leaves and poultry seasoning. My wife had chicken thighs (8 or so) in the slow cooker without a plan. I cut a lemon into slices and let that cook for 45 minutes or so. Then after taking the chicken off of the bone and putting it back in the cooker I added plenty of chicken broth the reviewer spices (a teaspoon or so each) and a teaspoon of chicken bouillon. To fix the gray color I added 15 or 20 drops of yellow food coloring. Near the end I added 3 or 4 tablespoons of cornstarch as a thickening agent. I added one tablespoon (mixed with a little water or chicken broth in measuring cup) to the mixture then let it sit for 5 minutes or so. I continued that process until the mixture is at a desirable consistency. By the way the lemons I used on the chicken lended a wonderful flavor that spread to the entire mixture. This recipe seems to have a wide margin for error. In preparing this dish--after 3 years of learning to cook I finally felt like I had enough confidence to deviate from the main recipe a bit. This is a keeper. Easy easy easy.",

It is very close to a dish that a college friend made.You can do a stew OR a soup with it. It was a bit bland so we added some celery salt a tablespoon of chicken bullion & some garlic (a must in this house). I will add more veggies next time and cut the chicken in half and use dark meat as well as a chicken breast. And since we couldn't find \"frozen noodles\" we used refrigerated \"fresh\" noodles and they cooked up just fine on high in the crockpot the last ten minutes. Make sure all of your ingredients are added to your taste before the noodles are added. I will definitely use this recipe again - THANKS!",
