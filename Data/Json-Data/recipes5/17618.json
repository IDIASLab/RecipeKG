It does taste pretty healthy that way; I'm sure it would taste a lot sweeter with the frosted wheat.  In my opinion, not as good plain as some other breads I've made.  It's good for sandwiches except it crumbles a bit, so not for hefty sandwiches.  Maybe for grilled cheese, actually.  Thanks for the recipe!",
