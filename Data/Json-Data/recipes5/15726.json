Just use oven safe small bowls (soup size works best) invert them on a cookie sheet (only 4 will fit each sheet) spray them very lightly with oil and place a tortilla over each bowl. Bake at 350 degrees for about 8 - 10 minutes. Let cool for about 2 minutes then remove the shell from the bowl and continue to cool a few more minutes on a rack. The tortillas will take on the shape of the inverted bowl while baking. They are light and crispy and I think taste much better than corn chips.",

As it is it's the perfect summer night dinner when you don't want to heat up the kitchen cooking a lot and don't want a heavy hot meal. I used tortilla chips and didn't have shredded cheese so I just used a can of condensed spicy cheese soup heated up. I did top my salad with some homemade guacamole as well. This is easy to customize to what you have on hand and suit to personal preferences. Great summer recipe!",

I never buy taco seasoning...usually just add what I have on hand garlic powder cumin chili powder all the things in taco seasoning anyway - and less expensive. You can also add salsa to the meat after it is browned. Doing that with tacos also helps your meat to bind together and not fall out.",
