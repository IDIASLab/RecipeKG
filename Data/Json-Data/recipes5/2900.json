I did make some changes just to suit my own tastes. I kept the pasta amount the same using tri-color parmesan tortellini. I doubled the herbs & veggies (I used red onion and a mix of red orange green & yellow peppers - very pretty!). I also added some ceyenne pepper. I used white wine vinegar and only 1/2 the amount of both the vinegar and olive oil. This was plenty of dressing - still a lot of flavor without being greasy. I think this makes many more servings than the recipe states unless it is all you are eating so even 1/2 a batch might be enough for a smaller gathering.",

I didn't use the feta cheese though I added broccoli and I also doubled the tortellini by using 2 packs of green tortellini instead of white and I used dry mint It was wonderful!! The dressing that this recipe calls for is abit too much for that amount of tortellini so that's why I doubled the pasta amount and it was perfect! ----------------- Thanks for the recipe We didn't even chill it we ate it right away and it was GOOD I hope to use it alot as my whole family enjoyed it!",

I added one big can of white chicken to make it more of a lunch main dish.  I used Balsamic vinegar.  Doubled the mint, basil and parsley.  Added a few dashes of hot sauce for a bite.  I also added alot more lemon juice because I couldn't taste it (the balsamic may have drowned it out) so all in all about 6-7 tablespoons.  I also increased the feta to a cup and used non fat.  I also chopped about a 1/2 of cucumber into it and decreased the onion to a 1/4 of a sweet yellow onion.",

I used one 9 oz three cheese and one 9 oz spinach and cheese (green) tortellini which made it even more colorful. The delightful taste and aroma of the fresh herbs were worth the extra trouble and expense as opposed to dried. Next time I think I will cut back a bit on the quantities of the green pepper and onion keeping the red bell pepper amount the same but that's just personal taste. I used sweet Vidalia onion and that flavor was great...not as overpowering as white yellow or red onion might have been. This was delicious and I plan to make it for the next pot luck or BBQ we attend this summer. I better take along copies of the recipe cause I know I'll be asked. Thanks Paul!",
