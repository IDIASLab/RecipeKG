This is a restaurant-caliber recipe that you truly can prepare in 15 minutes! For fussy eaters, I cut back on the lemon juice a little. I like to serve this with ratatouille. Serve with lemon wedges.",

The butter turned brown very quickly and then the bits of flour/fish left in the pan burned. I had to fish (no pun intended) out the burned bits before I poured the sauce over the fish. It would have been easier just to melt the additional butter/parsley/lemon in the microwave and pour it over the fish.",

Added capers to butter before placing sauce over sole. Great addition. Used butter versus coconut oil. Suggest this as the way to go. Credit must be given to Molly Wizenberg at Epicurious. With the exception of coconut oil rather than vegetable or canola oil this is the Epicurious recipe verbatim. I can only rate this recipe two stars because of that. If prepared as the Epicurious recipe it really is absolutely a five star recipe.",
