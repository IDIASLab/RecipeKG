Simply wipe them with a damp paper towel. The filling was very good, although I cheated and used Boursin herbed cream cheese instead of having to add my own seasonings. I also took it a step further and placed the mushrooms on a small square of Phyllo dough and wrapped them up into little bundles before I baked. Very nice appetizer Lynda and thanks!",
