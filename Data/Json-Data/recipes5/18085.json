This is a wonderful granola!  I used light brown sugar, canola oil, real Canadian maple syrup, 1c kosher coconut (it's natural, unsweetened, & tastes closer to fresh), & in addition to the slivered almonds, I added a cup of whole almonds.  Love almonds!  Sometimes also used golden raisins; they seem to be softer, stay fresh longer.  Thanks so much, Jennifer, for sharing your recipe!",

The jars leftover she gave to me which I used for breakfast (with a little milk...hmmm good). Having run out and wanting more I found this recipe. I used less coconut and in addition to the REAL maple syrup I added a couple TBLS of honey. I also assume that the submitted had intended for almonds to be in the ingrediant list so I just added 1/4c almonds and then another 1/3c of a halved pecan/walnut mix. Like another reviewer before me - to ensure that this doesn't burn stir every 8-10 minutes!! When I pulled out of the oven I added raisins crasins and some dried pineapple. GREAT granola! Very versatile to add what nuts and fruits you want and we are very pleased with the result! Mom = this recipe is almost as good as yours!! Thanks Jennifer for posting!",

I will add some whole almonds next time per LadyJayPee's suggestion. I used regular pancake syrup (sorry! didn't have the \"real stuff\") and a spoonful of cane syrup (like a mild molasses). I left mine in the oven a little too long, because it wasn't getting crisp, before I realized that it crisps up AFTER you take it out of the oven.

I used freshly ground flax seed instead of wheat germ cut the coconut down to a 7 oz. package and left out the brown sugar totally. The brown sugar would have made it cotton candy sweet in my opinion. I followed What A Dish's lead and used two baking sheets and to avoid the burning issue I nested them on top of an empty sheet before putting them in the oven. I finished it off with dried cranberries instead of raisins. This granola is not as oily as some and I think that is what puts it in the \"granola hall of fame\".

To correct this problem I made a second batch without any coconut at all and mixed it together with the overly-coconutty batch which saved the day! I do like crunchy clumps in my granola so I loved the suggestion to squeeze together some small clumps before baking. Be sure to mix this recipe together in a huge bowl (or stock pot). Also I baked it in a large (14x17) good quality turkey roaster and stirred every 15-20 minutes. Next time I'll cut the coconut in half and I think I'll try adding a touch of vanilla and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon too (Mmmmmmm I can taste it now).",

I also used craisins instead of raisins as a personal preference though I will most likely omit them altogether in the future since the granola is delicious without them. I and added more wheat germ and 1/2c. wheat bran for extra fiber and added cinnamon. I also cut back on coconut and agree with other reviews that it was a good change. I made this twice in one week and the second time I used honey in place of the maple syrup. The taste was very similar and since honey is much less expensive than syrup I think I will stick to that change in the future. It is good as a cereal and as a plain snack but it really shines when eaten with yogurt in my opinion.",
