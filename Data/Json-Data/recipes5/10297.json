I also substituted coconut/agave sugar in place of the maple syrup. I will add a banana next time to make it a bit sweeter (didn't have any in the house). I added baking soda and baking powder to make the pancakes fluffy cinnamon nutmeg ginger and cloves. I also added walnut pieces but you may want to add a smidgen more milk or oil to make the batter a bit less hearty. The walnuts thicken the batter a bit. Definitely a lot quicker than other recipes although my substitutions may have lengthened the cook time a bit; it's still quicker! Yummy!",

I did sub honey for the maple syrup (I don't use syrup on mine, I had them with a pear/apple butter). \nThe one big change I would make is to omit, or switch to just a pinch, of salt. Following the recipe, I found them to be too salty.  I would probably add almond or vanilla extract in the future as well. Good consistency, though, and a good base for someone who has little experience cooking with alternative flours!",

I did not add any maple syrup to the batter but did pour some on the finished pancakes. Also boosted the rise with a half teaspoon each of baking soda and baking powder and a splash of lemon juice. What took me by surprise in the first lot was how fast they began to burn on the bottom! I flipped the second and final lot sooner and that worked better. I was also surprised that they had to be turned before they set so they were wet inside and did not hold their shape when flipped. That being said, I found them much tastier than any wheat flour pancake I have ever eaten. I am keeping this recipe in my Allrecipes recipe box!",
