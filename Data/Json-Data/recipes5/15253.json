I made a few changes based on the previous reviews: I only used 1/2 cup of Israeli couscous instead of 1 cup couscous to keep it more like a soup; I added in some paprika with the other spices; and I left out the milk at the end. One more change I would make in the future is to use a full can of tomato paste instead of a few tablespoons of tomato puree (it could use that little bit of extra oomph from the tomato paste). I would make it again but with these changes.",

Maybe that is how this \"soup\" is supposed to be.. just be aware if you make this. Seasoning - need more. I added some vegetable soup base to the leftovers and that helped. Would suggest making this with a veggie or chicken stock instead of water... and increasing other seasonings",
