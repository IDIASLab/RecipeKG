It was a little difficult trying to remove the core and leaving the bottom intact, until I had a lightbulb moment and grabbed my melon baller. It works perfectly!  It seemed like a lot of cinnamon, but it really isn't. I baked the apples for 25 minutes and they were still firm, but cooked through how I like them.  I cut each apple into bite sized pieces and tossed them with the buttery cinnamon mixture. Delicious!",
