Chef John did a great job presenting this recipe, however,  I have to laugh when I read reviews of folks who consider themselves \"pro's\" and obviously have no concept of the basic \"mother sauces\" and what goes into them and what they are used for.  This recipe is (except for the thyme and cayenne) a very basic Bechamel or White Sauce - I learned this way back in 8th grade home economics class many decades ago and, yes, it does and should have nutmeg in it.  You don't just make this and dump it over food and expect that to be it.  You must adjust it - add cheddar cheese for a cheese sauce a 'la Mac and Cheese.  Add Gruyere and Parmesan to make a Mornay Sauce - great over veggies and even pasta - also used in a Kentucky Hot Brown.  There are 4 other Mother or basic sauces in French Cuisine which are the basis of almost all sauces - think Hollandaise (if you've had a yummy plate of Eggs Benedict you've had Hollandaise (a mother sauce) - it's the technique used to make mayonnaise.  This is such a basic sauce and can be made thinner or thicker depending on what you want to use it for - just use equal amounts of butter and flour to milk with a dash of nutmeg which enhances the taste of the sauce.  More flour and butter equals a thicker sauce.  Easy.",

I don't typically measure spices so I just dashed until it suited our taste. My husband loved it and he's not a fan of white sauce - and he's a meat-eater so it was high praise - for both the sauce and the lasagna! Thank you Chef John!!",
