After reading the reviews, I decided to try it with 2-1/2 cups of flour and add a 1/4 cup of additional peanut butter.  Our cookies were absolutely PERFECT.  I used a cookie scoop and slightly smooshed them with the back of a spoon - added an extra couple of minutes to cook since they're a bit larger using the scoop.  One thing I've noticed with peanut butter cookies - the pb taste is not that strong when they're warm and that they have more flavor the next day. Three days later these cookies are still soft in the middle, slight crunch around the center and have a delicious peanut butter taste - and you just got to love those chocolate chips - I used mini's!",

The dough wasn't stiff enough to roll into a ball so I just used a cookie scoop and then used the back of a spoon to smoosh them down a little. I had to cook mine a little longer about 13 minutes was just right. Thanks for the recipe!",
