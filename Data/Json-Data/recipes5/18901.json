The only thing I did different was that I was running low on green pepper and subbed in some yellow and orange pepper instead and I used venison stew chunks cooked on high for about 5 hours. Grandsons liked this and it is a little on the sweet side so I recommend serving with something like corn bread and cole slaw... it's just a little rich on it's own. I'm sure I will make this again and it makes a LOT!",
