Anyway I put out the bowls as you suggested along with little bowls of M&Ms raisins and dried fruit pieces. They all had a great time pressing their goodies into these cookies and comparing notes. Thank you for not only a tasty recipe but for a great idea to keep children entertained on a rainy Seattle day.",

Instead of butter we used half margarine and half apple sauce. She was hesitant to smoosh the ingredients with her fingers (she's used to me using beaters) so I helped her do it. After flattening the cookies to about \" we decorated the tops with Craisins and Smarties (Canadian M&Ms only better!). They only took maybe 8 minutes to cook. Since we didn't flatten them much they ended up being thicker softer cookies although the one-third size batch (2 cups of oats) only made 3 dozen cookies. Very tasty. Thanks for sharing L.A.
