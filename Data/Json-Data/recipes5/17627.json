I made a few changes: I increased the butter to 3/4 cup melted it with the brown sugar and spread it in the bottom of the 9 x 13 pan. Also make sure you spray the sides of the pan very well or else the rolls will stick. I sprinkled the pudding mix right on top of the butter/brown sugar then sprinkled pecan pieces on top. Then I placed the rolls on top of all that let them rise then baked them. They turned out so good! Thanks!",

We had them once a year on christmas morning. I was always intimidated to try making them myself. Then I saw this recipe and it was CLOSE ENOUGH for me! They have that same taste and almost the same texture I remember. I have made this recipe a few times now and my family has loved them every time. They are a little rich so I would not make them more then two or three times a year. Whatever you do DON'T double the butter/brown sugar. I tried it once and it made them harder to cook because the center stayed doughy so long that the rest of the rolls on the outside started burning even after covering with foil. It just became a big headache. I really appreciate how easy this recipe is. I use Rhodes frozen dinner rolls. They are perfect for Christmas mornings because they fill the whole house with a wonderful aroma and they are really easy to just pop in the oven in the morning while presents are being opened. Thanks!",
