The pie crust didn't stay on the apple but instead slid down and formed a mess at the bottom of the apple. Also I cooked it for more like 40 mins but the crust never browned. =( I'm going to try it again - because the apple tasted really good. But as written this is not a 5-star recipe. Note: It could also use some cinnamon and vanilla ice cream on the side.",
