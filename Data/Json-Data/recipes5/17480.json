Like others, I rolled the dough between parchment paper to make it easier on myself...  cut the cookies there and simply lifted the parchment paper onto the cookie sheet. Easier cleanup, and no mushed shapes!  The cookies held their shapes well during cooking, even the ones I'd used the melon baller on.  I highly recommend this recipe.",

My son loved how fast he got to decorate them. No chilling time was very helpful with little ones. Tastes a little like chocolate chip cookies, minus the chocolate chips. Only downside is used them with a leaf cookie cutter and they puff up a lot so they looked more like clouds. But will defenitly use the recipe again! Thanks!!",
