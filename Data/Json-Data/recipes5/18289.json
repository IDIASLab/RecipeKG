I made the minor tweaks that many recommended:\n1. double sauce recipe (although really 1.5x would have been enough)\n2. added 3 cloves minced garlic to sauce\n3. cut oil in half and used olive oil vs. sesame\n\nThe meat came out so tender and flavorful.  Poured the sauce from the bottom of the pan over the meat and used for dipping.  \n\nHusband loved as well.  Kind of surprised that my kids (11,8) were just ok with it.  I don't care, however, this was so good that they will just have to ok with it!",

I doubled the recipe, using olive oil instead of sesame seed oil (because i had none) then added chopped garlic and about 1/3 cup melted butter to the glaze and cooked it all together at the same time at the same temperature (350) the whole way through, occasionally basting the tops of the loins using a turkey baster. While eating I gave everybody a little side dish of the sauce to dip their pork into while eating. It was so good everyone drank whatever was left in their side dish! I make this again and again, perhaps using different meats. It's basically a honey garlic sauce the way I made it, I think next time I will do chicken wings! Also, it is better than soya sauce in plain rice!! Compliments to the chef!",

It was great. HOWEVER when using the juices to make a gravy it was evident that there was too much oil. So as a marinade and cooking liquid it's great as is. BUT if you are wanting to finish with a sauce I'd cut back quite a bit on the sesame. I think this would be fantastic on chicken and maybe even a beef roast... YUMMY.",

I added 2 cloves of garlic and red pepper chilli flakes to the sauce. I also basted it every 5-10 minutes so a lot of the glaze would be on the outside of the pork.  I would suggest adding parchment paper to the pan because of the high sugar content of the glaze.  This will make for easy clean up.  Thanks for the recipe, Mokonak.",
