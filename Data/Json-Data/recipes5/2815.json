I made just a few adjustments: I used 1/3 c of butter and 1/3 c of extra virgin olive oil and sauteed 1/2 of a large shallot (chopped) until tender in a large skillet on top of the stove. THEN,  I added the garlic (6 cloves -  do not brown), shrimp, lemon juice, parsley and 1 1/2 tsp of sea salt. At the end, I added a half a can of chicken broth to make more sauce. The broth really cut the oil and rounded out the flavor,leaving plenty of juice for the pasta to soak up. I used angel hair pasta instead of linguini. Just wonderful.....After the pasta was eaten, we dunked our focaccia bread in the extra sauce....",

Used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, a touch of chicken broth and about 1/4 cup white wine.  Using good quality EVOO and white wine make all the difference.  Also, for flavouring added a few shakes of red chili pepper flakes, juice from a whole lemon, about double the asked for amount of parsley and 5 garlic cloves.   Will definitely make again.",

The 3/4 cup butter is way too much. I used 1/2 cup and the pasta could still stand to lose another 1/4 cup. My pasta was swimming in butter and I used 16 ounces of pasta rather than the 12 ounces listed in the recipe. I also added double the lemon juice and crushed red pepper flakes to give it some heat. I liked baking the shrimp, it added a nice flavor. I'll be making this often. Thanks!",
