My husband will not touch a sardine (not yet) so I make this for my lunch I buy just a couple of crusty French rolls from our bakery about 5 inches long and split one of them (saving the other for the next day) I brush both sides inside with a bit of olive oil and place them on my stove's grill while toasting I prep my other ingredients. I end up with two open face sandwiches.......so yummy! Sometimes I will puree (smash/mash/smear) 1/2 garlic clove and mix it with the oil I brush on the roll if I want to go Nordic I will take a few pickled onion slivers and lay them atop the mashed avocado add the sardines and omit the tomatoes....Delish!",
