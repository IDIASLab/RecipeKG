The whole package of cream cheese is needed as it makes the filling so creamy. I also increased the green onions to 3 and chopped them finely. I doubled the crab and shrimp which I pulsated in a mini-food processor/chopper first to make it finer. The finishing touch was a ton of freshly grated parmegiano reggiano on top of the mushrooms. I also cooked the mushrooms for a bit longer than what the recipe called for as I wanted the mushrooms to be fully cooked. Then I broiled for a few minutes until the cheesy tops were browned. Mmmmmm, good. This was a huge hit at the last family gathering. Everyone could not get enough.",

It turns out that a single recipe would have easily filled 24 medium sized mushrooms, or close to it. I had a lot of left over filling. I will definitely be making these again.",
