I was making it for a casual birthday dinner party, so I prepped everything up to the \"drizzle lemon juice\" point ahead of time.  Just before service, I drizzled, scattered, spread, and sprinkled.  I did use a bit more fresh parm than called for (probably about an eighth of a cup?) and used \"Caesar Dressing\" from this site as the caesar dressing.  Oh, I also couldn't bring myself to use the full 2C of lemon juice, as it just seemed like too much.  I finished what I had in a bottle, probably closer to 1 C and it worked very well.  If you're looking to switch up your tired salad standbys, this is one to try!  THANKS, for the recipe, fail fail try again!",

I made 'Batman's Best Caesar Dressing' rather than using store bought dressing.  The ingredient combination is rather different, but in a delightful way - it works.  I did not use 2 cups of lemon juice, just seemed liked a lot and the salad would be floating.  I drizzled on about 3/4 cup and it was enough as you could taste it in the salad.  Everyone at worked liked this salad and it is a nice different salad.  I'm sure you won't find another one like it at your next gathering.  It is best if eaten in the first serving as the lettuce and croutons didn't hold up at all for leftovers the next day.  Thanks fail fail try again, for sharing your recipe.",
