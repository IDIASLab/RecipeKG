I ended up using 3 tablespoons sesame butter (asian style with a little heat) 1/3 cup olive oil and 1-1/2 large lemons (came to 7 tablespoons). I sprinkled with a little cayenne for a little added kick and really upped the garlic just for my own taste. I feel if I had made this as written it would not have been smooth enough for my taste. Made the way I made it I would give it 5 stars thought it was awesome. I feel it needs more oil than the recipe stated but it could just be personal preference in liking a less chunky hummus.",

I soaked mine for 24 hours first and then I just boiled in a pan of with water until they were softened.  When I blended the ingredients, I made the following additions.  I added a little turmeric for color and taste.  I added some parsley.  I added a little black pepper.  I had a can of roasted red peppers from Wegmans, so I threw in slightly less more than half of one large roasted red pepper and I cut the garlic back just a little.  I got rave reviews!  This is now my favorite hummus recipe and I will never EVER buy from the store again!\n\nP.S. If you like your hummus smooth, the roasted red pepper will help to smooth it out instead of adding of more olive oil...",

I used my own recipe of prepared tahina to balance out the nuttiness (again not a big fan of chickpeas) and followed through with the rest of the directions. I also drastically cut back on the olive oil (only used a few tbsps) which makes for a drier less oily dip but it does not compromise on flavour. It might be the can of chickpeas I used but I had an entire Ziploc left over after using only about 1/2 cup. You can add & mix a drizzle of olive oil and paprika to boost the consistency and flavour as you keep it in the fridge. I will definitely be keeping this one.",
