This worked perfectly since I had the ingredients for both hummus and tahini. My only change in ingredients was using green romanesco rather than broccoli. (Did I mention the challenge of farm boxes?) To keep the garbanzo beans from getting too crunchy I put them in the oven 10 minutes later. When making the dressing I alternated adding a tablespoon of olive oil with a tablespoon of water until the blender could smoothly blend the mix. It was thick but coated the roasted veggies well. No one in my family eats cooked cauldiflower by choice but I served this as a main dish and had no left overs. Would I run out to buy the ingredients to make again? Probably not. Will I keep the recipe for future seasonal cauliflower delivery? Definitely!",
