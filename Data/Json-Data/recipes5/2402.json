Then add enough of the broth back in to moisten the chicken before adding the bbq sauce. Great served on Hawaiian rolls with coleslaw.",

I'm trying to reduce my consumption of sodium on a daily basis due to blood pressure issues and this Instant Pot Chicken has 8579mg of sodium in a single serving???  It is recommended that we all have, at the most, 2300 mg of sodium for an entire day much less 8579mg for just one serving of 'Instant Pot Chicken'.  American Heart Association is recommending that sodium be reduced to 1300mg/da.\nI thought that it must be a misprint but......I'm sure the pkg of Hidden Ranch Seasoning/ Dip/Dressing doesn't help the sodium content either.  If that is not a missprint, can you make it without all of that sodium?  Please help if you can.  I'd really like to try this if the sodium content is inaccurate.",
