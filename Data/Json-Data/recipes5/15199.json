The other thing I did differently was that I browned the meat in a separate pan and then drained the fat. The recipe was a little time consuming but worth it. A really delicious recipe.",

I often have hardboiled eggs ready to go in the fridge and that cuts prep time down to 'long enough to cook rice and smash it in a bowl ' about 30 minutes. Hubby found this dish to be on the plain side for his taste and ended up adding fish oil and chili oil and stirring it in (ew but whatever he had to eat it) and said that made it fantastic.

I just happened to be making chicken noodle soup at the same time so I kept adding the broth from my soup to the meat mixture because I also did not want to fry the potatoes. I added the potatoes at the same time as the carrots. I cut the potato up in really small cubes and added the chicken broth. I put in some garlic salt and some creole seasoning to give the meat more flavor. Without adding the broth garlic salt and creole seasoning the meat would have been really bland. As someone has already said if you are on a low sodium diet then this would be a good recipe otherwise it is better with modifications.",
