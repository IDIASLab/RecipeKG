Alternatively you can also freeze the filling and mashed potato separately and combine at time of cooking.",

But when one has leeks and fish that needs to be used and new pie pans...this is where you end up!  We played a bit with herbs and spices but I have to say this is one fantastic dish. We switched to using bay, bacon, garlic, fresh thyme and parsley and left out the nutmeg.  Very, very good and everyone ate it which in my home is always a nice surprise!  I am going to go back and try the original seasoning and maybe a pie crust instead of the mashed potatoes, too.",
