My family did not care for the texture of the sauce though because cooking the sour cream in the sauce caused the sour cream to \"break\". We much prefer the \"salsa chicken\" on this site. I prepare it the same way as this recipe to completely coat the chicken in the taco seasoning. We just dollop some sour cream on top of the salsa chicken when it has cooked. You get the same flavor profile as this chicken without having the dairy separate in the sauce.",
