I fed some to my neighbor and he went home and made one. Good stuff and I will make it again. Thanks for posting this.",

My cake ended up being way overdone and I think that last step (leaving in oven with door open) is the reason why. I looked back to my tried and true Japanese cheesecake recipe (Cotton Soft Japanese Cheesecake from Diana's Desserts) and realised that this is more or less the same recipe, only Diana's does not say to leave it in the oven after cooking! Sigh, I am not straying from Diana's perfect recipe again. Sorry, I really wanted to like this recipe.",

It tastes very very close to what we have in Japan, and what we pick up at the Japanese market in Denver. Bravo!",
