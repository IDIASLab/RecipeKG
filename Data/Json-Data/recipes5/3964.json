I did let the chicken sit with the yogurt overnight and the chicken came out wonderfully tender - my husband loved it. I made a few small changes. I did not have capers so I added some fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce just before putting the cooked chicken back into the pan. I also sprinkled the top of the chicken with some freshly chopped chives to add a little color. I used Pinot Grigio white wine since that was all I had on hand. I will definitely be making this again!",

I only cooked each side of chicken for 3 mins to brown used chicken broth instead of vermouth and returned chicken to pan to finish cooking in sauce. Served with whole wheat pasta.",

I don't usually go out and purchase things for recipes since we have tons of food in this house but we don't really have any chicken breasts right now so I looked for them today at the store. I couldn't bring myself to pay for chicken breasts that weren't on sale so I ended up with boneless skinless chicken thighs instead but they worked just as well. I used white wine instead of vermouth since I didn't have it and it worked just fine. I may have had the heat under the skillet up too high bc I really had to work to get the browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Once I figured that out it worked smoothly. I love capers so I added more. Ate this with salad bread and spaghetti. I have plenty of leftovers (Bf's away) but I'm so excited about eating these leftovers I don't even mind. Thanks for the recipe!",
