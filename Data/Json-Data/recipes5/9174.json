It was best right out of the ice cream maker when it was a soft serve consistency. It was so fluffy and creamy! We love making ice cream but this was way easier and a bit healthier... well at least it was before I mixed a piece of red velvet cake into it ha! Thanks for this recipe:)",

I will make this again. I used regular lowfat vanilla yogurt although I will try with Greek yogurt next time. I used honey flavored bourbon instead of brandy.
