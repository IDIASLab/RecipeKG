Everyone kept going back for more and everyone requested the recipe.  Just be sure you let everyone know that it's a DESSERT cheese ball.  No one had ever seen a dessert cheese ball before, and one lady got quite confused as to why a cheese ball had black specks in it and was served with graham crackers! I served it with regular graham crackers and also chocolate graham crackers.  I think it tasted best with the chocolate graham crackers.  A helpful hint: Add graham crackers and/or chocolate graham crackers to the ingredients list.  Since they weren't listed, when I made my grocery list I neglected to buy any and had to make a special trip back to the grocery store when I realized I had nothing to serve the cheese ball with!",

Next day, flip it over on a plate, press on the outer topping of your choice, and Viola!  Much easier to serve and scoop off of rather than a big round ball anyway.  ",

I did whip mine a long time in the mix master and placed in a bowl in the fridge over night. It was very soft but after a day in the fridge it formed into a perfect ball. I scooped it out onto waxed paper and rolled in Toffee bits. It really tasted like cookie dough once chilled. For those having trouble with forming a ball you might want to chill it in a metal bowl and be sure to use room temperature (real) butter and (regular)cream cheese. I don't know if the whipping had anything to do with it but my cheese ball did form well. Good luck:) Thanks for a great new recipe.",
