I've tried recipes that are just as good, with easier and faster preparation, so I won't be trying this one again.  But it is excellent!\r\nTo the person who \"didn't get the taste of butter chicken at all,\" your name implies that you may be Indian, so maybe you know more about this subject than I do but: welcome to the world of Butter Chicken.  I often eat at Indian restaurants and usually order butter chicken (it is my most favourite dish in the world).  I have had butter chicken that is mild, spicy, sweet, bland, yellow, orange, red, almost greenish, creamy, not at all creamy, tomatoey, coconutty, with and without nuts and raisins.  Such is the variety of butter chicken recipes - it depends on which part of India the chef hails from.  Perhaps this recipe did not tickle your fancy, but it IS butter chicken.  Marination in yoghurt is the key to tender chicken, the longer you marinate, the better.  I always marinate the chicken the night before, or in the morning.",

I've always wanted to be able to make my favorite dishes at home, but a lot of the recipes on the internet tasted NOTHING like the chicken Makhani in the restaurants. This recipe was DELICIOUS!!  It was actually better than what I've had in restaurants!  One note:  If you are used to really mild makhani, I'd skip the green chili pepper.  Used serrano pepper and it wasn't too spicy but there was definitely a bite.  I'll be keeping this recipe!",

Also I like spicy food and this was way too spicy! So what I would suggest for this recipe is make it a day before and cut down on the chili powder by at least 1/2. If it's not spicy enough for you you can always add but can never subtract.",
