If I don't have time for a homemade pizza crust I use two cans of refrigerated crescent roll dough. If you have it leftover this is a good way to use leftover taco meat or even leftover chicken/beef fajita filling from the night before. This is good either hot or cold--my family likes it both ways. GREAT spin on mexican-themed dinner night.",

I sauteed about 1/4 cup of onion along with the ground beef and used \"Taco Seasoning II\" from this site. For the prepared pizza crust I opted for a Boboli bread shell and used homemade salsa I had on hand. I also opted out extra the cilantro. After the \"pizza\" cooled a bit I topped it with all the \"taco\" toppings to make it nice and pretty: de-seeding my tomato and adding a little homemade guacamole. The leftovers are fabulous too that is is you have any....",

I used regular pizza dough, pre-baked it for five minutes at 425\u00b0 so it won't be soggy and it held the pizza just fine. Couldn't find the canned tomatoes specified, so I used a 10oz. can of tomatoes and diced green chilies, with the salsa and just added in some fresh minced garlic and onions, used my immersion blender to mix it up. I did mix a bit into the beans to make them easier to spread onto the dough. For the ground beef mixture I used my own taco seasonings, and added in some fresh garlic, onions, and chopped green chilies, then let it simmer for a bit, no need for the extra water addition. It all baked up at 425\u00b0 in 15 minutes to a perfect golden brown crust. The little bit of sauce leftover was great for dipping the crust. We will make this one again when we can't decide, Tacos or Pizza?",

The \"sauce\" makes quite a bit extra (like twice as much as we needed) but it is really yummy drizzled on top of the pizza and also as a salsa with chips!! Also I pre-baked my thin crusts for about 5 mins. and my pizzas still took probably about 30 minutes to be done to our liking. Next time I might try increasing the oven temperature. I've never been a fan of taco pizzas in the past - but this recipe is the bomb! Thanks for sharing Daisy K!",

The first was after the beef mix was prepared and the diced tomato mix was prepared I mixed the two of them together (yes there is sauce leftover). The second was using a whole wheat flour tortilla instead of prepared pizza crust. I used my judgement in the amount that I layered on the tortilla knowing it wouldn't hold the weight that a pizza crust would. This change allowed me to make about 8 pizzas. Very forgiving adaptable and delicious pizza that will be made again!! Thanks Daisy.",

The other half said it was OK but missing something I think it had too much cold toppings for the thin crust. It would have been better on a regular thicker crust or the thin would have worked if I used less toppings. I will give a little time to past for the other half and try it again on a thicker crust and post a update to this.",
