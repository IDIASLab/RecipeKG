My sister and I made this together and weren't sure how it would turn out but all of the flavors ended up coming together beautifully. Some things we did a little different were using large shell pasta instead of macaroni which hold more of the sauce in the pasta. We also used half milk and half heavy cream used a can of chopped green chilies and topped the dish off with some shredded cheese the last few minutes of baking. It turned out perfect and very delicious... I definitely recommend trying this recipe!",
