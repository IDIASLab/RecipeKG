Substituted white onion  for the shallot. And used 4 cloves of garlic.  I also reduced the butter by half.  Like another reviewer suggested, I added fresh chopped tomato toward the end of cooking the zucchini.  This along with the green on the zucchini made a very colorful dish.  I sprinkled the parmesan on individual servings to reduce the amount needed. My husband liked it with a light touch of cayenne.  I will definitely make it again.",

Adds just a \"little kick\" to the dish\n\nDon't go overboard on the garlic. OK the first day, but if you use a LOT of garlic, then re-heat the next day, you will stand alone in a crowd!
