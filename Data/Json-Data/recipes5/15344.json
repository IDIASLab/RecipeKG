Even then the sausage pieces were almost black on the bottoms and the roux was 1 shade lighter than black.  Much, much darker than what was shown in the video.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I was frustrated that it had gotten so dark and almost didn't serve it, but my daughter said it actually added to the flavor, and my husband came back for seconds.  And to be honest, once I tasted it myself I was surprised that it didn't taste burned at all.  In fact, the flavor was quite good.  So I would say that it turned out well, but next time I would probably start the oven at 375 and not bake it so long for each step.",

Makes a ton, I will be freezing some for sure. Also, I added 4 strips of bacon to compensate for having a mix of white and dark meat.",
