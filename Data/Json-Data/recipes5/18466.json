I add everything to the crock pot with two additional ingredients--minced garlic and parmesan cheese.  I also cut down on the sugar and add a bit more crushed red perpper.  It takes 3-4 hours on low in the crock pot.  My husband likes it served with mashed potatoes but I prefer rigatoni--tonight I will serve it with both!",

I have found the best way to reduce the fat content is to oven-brown the short ribs prior to adding to the sauce. Place bone side down in a pan, sesaon with pepper & salt roast for 45 minutes at 450. Drain off fat. If ribs are large return to oven for 15 minutes more.  I was reluctant to try this the first time but it's the only way I pre-pare them now. I got over 1/2 cup of fat from the 2 1/2 lbs ribs I used for this recipe. I browned the onions in a dutch oven, added a a couple minced garlic cloves, and about 1/2 broth to the sauce ingredients and then the browned ribs. Baked covered at 325 for 2 1/2 hours. Served with parmesan mashed potatoes. They were moist and succulent. Received rave reviews with request for promise to repeat.",

Then I poured off the grease in the roasting pan, poured on the sauce and let it bake in the oven at 325 for 2 more hours and it was wonderful. Will use the left over sauce tonight on meatloaf.",
