The consistency of the dough was very sticky and could not be rolled into logs like the recipe suggested - not even after chilling it for hours. I ended up just dropping the dough by spoonfuls (a horrible process with the sticky dough) onto cookie sheets. Though they rose perfectly turned a perfect golden color and are nice and soft they taste nothing at all like the promised \"toffee\"! (The most distinct flavor I can pick out when eating them is SALT!)",
