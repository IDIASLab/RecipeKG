I had to sub the dijon mustard for Cleveland stadium mustard, which is on the spicier side, with good results.",

The sauce pairs well with any mild flavored fish but melds with  steelhead or salmon in an exceptional way! Two forks up!",

It's a very firm textured fish, and I don't think I over-cooked it, but it still seemed a bit dry.  The sauce might be really good on salmon, which we all love.  I doubled the sauce recipe since I was using 24 oz. of fish.  UPDATE 5/2/16 - Doubled sauce again, using 1.3 lbs. of fish.  Felt it was fairly heavy on the dijon mustard BUT the fish was so moist/tender this time - not at all the firm texture, or dry, as I said from last time.  Maybe I did overcook it then.  Will be trying steelhead trout again, maybe with a different recipe.",

Kind of rolled the foil so the juices would stay under ther fillet , yet left the top open. Baked it 10 min. Took it out, discarded the skin, and poured the rest of the sauce on it. Broiled another 10 min. Served over thyme and rosemary herbed rice, with a side of lemon.  Additional sides of black eyed peas and brussel sprouts sauteed with onion and turkey bacon. Thank you! This was so good.\n(I didn't have the wine so I subbed it for a mix of water and white vinegar, half of each. Worked great! Also did 3Tbl of Dijon, mine was made with Chardonnay. )",
