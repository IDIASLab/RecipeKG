We are trying to cut back a little on the amount of red meat we eat so I only used 1/2 a pound of ground beef but I added in about a cup of cooked brown rice before adding the gravy to make up for what we were leaving out. I used an entire 8oz container of fresh unsliced mushrooms - I'm not sure if that would have been the same as using 1 cup but because they shrink down while in the saute pan it turned out to be just the right amount. I also used only about a half a cup of gravy to bring the beef mixture together and I saved the rest for each person at the table to use on top of the meal. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!",

Used entire two cups of gravy in mixture to bind and made a third cup to drizzle over cooked peppers. I also seasoned the last cup of gravy a little to give it some added flavor. It turned out pretty good despite the fact that I only had green peppers on hand. I am sure it will be even better with red.",

This is a great basic recipe that stands beautifully on it s own or you can add as much of what you like to taste. My 2nd time making this I saut\u00e9ed the onions and mushrooms first added a 1/2 cup of uncooked 30 minute rice some Italian bread crumbs minced garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I also didn t blanch the peppers first and instead added a bit of water to the pan to steam a bit during cooking. Peppers came out al dente which is the way we personally like them. Using small peppers makes for a very nice appetizer too!",
