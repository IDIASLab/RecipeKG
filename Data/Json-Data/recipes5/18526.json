My husband wanted ham for Thanksgiving, and I knew the oven would be in use, so I wanted a slow cooker recipe. This one was perfect. I used a 2\u00bd pound boneless ham, so I cut the brown sugar down to around 3/4 of a cup (\u00bd cup in the bottom of the slow cooker and 1/4 cup rubbed on the ham). I flipped it around periodically while cooking so all sides would be evenly coated, plus I basted it once in a while with the brown sugar syrup. Even my picky 2-year old daughter (who does NOT like meat) enjoyed it... She finished a whole serving! Thanks for an excellent recipe!",

One word of caution to anyone wishing to use a spiral-sliced ham.... 8 hours is really too long, try 4 or 5 hours.  I can't wait to try this recipe with a non spiral-sliced ham.",

My husband absolutely loved it and said that I better hold on to this recipe.  I think I can remember it, its so simple.\r\n\r\nI am a slow cooker novice, and the fact that this recipe had no liquid scared me a little, so I did add a little water to the brown sugar at the bottom to make it soupy, and only used a cup and a half of brown sugar.\r\nI don't think I would have needed to though, there was alot of liquid from the ham.  \r\nDefinate keeper!
