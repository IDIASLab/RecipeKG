I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added a block of reduced fat cream cheese and also substituted fresh lime juice for the lemon because it made more sense with the avacados. I increased the amount of condensed milk to about 10-12 ozs. based on similar recipes I've found (many other recipes like this call for a full 15 oz. can) and everything fit perfectly into a 9\" pie crust. Definitely chill this for at least 6-8 hour if not overnight for the best set/flavor and look for good quality ripe avocados as this is the KEY to this recipe. Still can't get over how fresh and unique these ingredients taste together - wouldn't have expected it! Thanks so much for the recipe...this will be a new summertime favorite!:-)",

I suspected that it would be INCREDIBLY intense/rich and I was right; I personally couldn't eat more than a spoonful. I can't imagine eating this as a straight-up pie without anything to offset the richnesss. It's a strange recipe; not BAD strange just strange. I think it could be stellar in the right context.",
