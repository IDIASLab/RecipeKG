        "description": "Every typical Indian party in the US is bound to have some variation of channa masala, a North Indian chickpea curry made with tomato, onion, and an Indian spice combination. However, this traditional chickpea curry with cilantro and coconut from Kerala, provides a fresh and healthy alternative to an old favorite. This recipe is also great for anyone new to veganism (or vegetarianism). Serve hot over rice, or idiyappam (South Indian rice noodles).",
