For our taste, we thought the cake was a bit too sweet as written, so I made it again using just the yellow cake mix and 1 tb. meringue powder. Worked great.  I quickly rolled them in the gelatin mixture (not to overly absorb.) The outer edge seems a bit soft at first but firms-up nicely after gelatin sets. I froze them in a square cake carrier with some plastic wrap lightly covering them for added protection and put on the lid too. I can take-out however many I need to defrost at room-temp. about 15 minutes. Makes for an unexpected treat for company. Everyone I've served them to, thought they were extremely tasty. For a faster fix can pump-in whipped topping for the filling, (if desired.) Won't be as flavorful but very good still and lite. Thank-you for the recipe.",

Many comments... \"the best\"... \"much, much better than store bought\"...\"so good...moist, not too sweet and great flavor\", etc... I agree with every compliment. They are perfect! Followed the recipe except used a canoe  pan and didn't chop the coconut in the processor. Excellent recipe with great instructions. I'm looking forward to making these often.

Put Jello on crumb side and frosted the other with the cream filling as I assembled the cake. Then just sprinkle coconut on the frosted parts making sure to save some for the top of cake. This recipe is well worth the effort!!! Thank You for sharing. P.S.Instead of the jello you can use raspberry (seedless) jelly Add small amt. of water to thin it out and paint it on with a pastry brush. Muffin pan is much quicker if in a hurry....",
