The flavor is fantastic (depending on the qualify of ingredients you use of course) but when you bite into a piece your head kind of rattles a little because of all of the quinoa popping against your teeth and just when you think you're done with a bite... you're not - really. That quinoa just hangs around and hangs around in your mouth defying all sorts of statistical odds. Since quinoa is on the pricey side I definitely wouldn't consider doing this again but I give serious kudos to Anthony for the sheer unlikeliness of the ingredients in this recipe.",

They weren't overly hard or teeth breaking.. kind of like little tiny grains of earthy nuttiness stewn throughout. They didn't taste overly sweet to me either which was nice. I actually nuked the chocolate mixture in the microwave because I've had chocolate seize up on me on the stovetop and didn't want to chance it here. I can't wait to share these treats with friends..
