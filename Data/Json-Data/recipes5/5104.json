This is a keeper for sure and very forgiving. First use either 1/2 lb pasta or double the sauce. If you can get fresh peas you are blessed. (I did manage to score fresh peas) If you don't have fresh peas use frozen but do not blanch them with the asparagus. Which brings me to blanching. I brought a large pot of water to a boil - added salt and added the peas - scooped them out and into ice water - then added the asparagus except for the tips - cooked those to bright green and into the cold water. Cook the pasta in the same water that was used to blanch the vegetables. I cooked the bacon - removed and de-glazed the pan with the lemon juice - which wasn't enough so I added 1/4 cup white wine to de-glaze (you could also use pasta water or more lemon juice or both) I did not add the bacon back in as I don't like soggy bacon. Add the vegetables and the tips of the asparagus. Add the cooked pasta - straight from the pot with some of the pasta water. Add the cream - then add the bacon just before serving. Delicious!",

I didn't blanch the veggies - added the stem pieces with the onion along with some garlic and lemon zest to up the lemon flavor and then added the tips and peas near end just to eat through.

We thought it needed more of the sauce and maybe a few more spices. We are having the leftovers tonight and I'm going to make a light fettuccine sauce to add the creaminess that we feel is missing. Might also add some red pepper flakes. I added the bacon right at the end to ensure it's crunchiness. Not a fan of soggy bacon. I think this dish has great potential as the ingredients are very good but for us I need to play with the sauce a little bit.",

I did not have fresh pasta so I used dried and frozen peas instead of fresh. Also I didn't want to buy heavy cream just for 3 T so I used a little sour cream instead. This was very good. I simply sauteed the veggies in the bacon fat rather than boiling and I think that really added great flavor.

When my pasta was almost ready I added the cheese and cream to the veggies and stirred til evenly melted. I felt it needed more cream so all in all I probably used about 1/2 cup of cream.

I only used 1/2 lb of fettuccine & asparagus but put a lot more cream in the sauce (next time I want to try using some of the pasta water instead of extra cream to save on calories & make it a little less rich). I used parm mozzarella (next time I will only use parm - the mozz made it stringy). I also omitted the peas. I cooked the bacon in the microwave (a couple extra pieces of bacon wouldn't have hurt;) & sauteed the veggies in 2 tbsp of butter. I was worried about the asparagus since it was still pretty raw after 5 min boiling (which I then put in a bowl of ice water). But I just made sure to saute it long enough with the onions (I also added a fresh minced clove of garlic right before adding the cream). Very simple & relatively quick dinner.",
