I have made two batches and both turned out well. I used foil to line the pan (makes for easy removal of squares) but remember to grease/spray the foil! Otherwise as in my second batch the squares will REALLY stick to the foil. Also I didn't bother melting the chocolate chips separately: I sprinkled them on the top of the squares when there was two or three minutes left in the baking time and then smoothed the chocolate evenly with a knife. Stick them in the fridge awhile cut eat! Delicious! Thanks Josh!",

When the timer went off I used a butter knife to spread the chocolate out. Threw the whole pan in the freezer for an hour. Took them out and used a greased sharp knife to cut into bars and then threw them back in the freezer. I'm leaving them in there and just grabbing one out when I want it.",

Made a delicious icing that wasn't too sweet! 4) Put pan in freezer for 30 min after baking for 14 minutes instead of 12 5) Used pecans instead of walnuts Thanks so much! GREAT base recipe!",
