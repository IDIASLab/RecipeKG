I've never made caramel corn before - it always seemed like a very involved process. This was really simple though. Yes it takes a little time to get it all together (the melting time) but it was totally worth it. My daughters shook some sprinkles in while I was mixing and that was fun. We made the popcorn in our microwave popping bowl and only did half the amount - saving the rest of the caramel for another time. I'll be interested to see how well it melts down next time. Don't hesitate to make this - it's really yummy. Oh and we only have mini marshmallows. I found somewhere online where it said 1 lg marshmallow=10 minis... meaning 230 for this recipe. My husband counted them out and it worked great!",

One important tip remember that burning butter drastically alters flavour. Cook slowly! Also the caramel goes farther than you think. It's very flavourful so you likely won't need to use it all. Like the recipe says you can store the extra and microwave it later. Wonderful! Thank you for this recipe! It's a keeper!!!",

The Pinterest recipe was a big failure. But THIS recipe is amazing. I am not a fan of microwave popcorn, so that is the only change I made. Instead, I put about 2 Tablespoons of coconut oil in a large pot with 1 cup of popcorn kernels. Then heat over medium or medium high heat (cover with aluminum foil, poke with knife to make ten slits). Shake every half minute or so as they pop. This produced the perfect amount of popcorn for this recipe. You could even use a little less popcorn, if you want it to be REALLY gooey. Dang, can't wait to make this again!",
