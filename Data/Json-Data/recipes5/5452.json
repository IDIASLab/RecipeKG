The use of the green salsa gave it a nice depth of flavor.   Make sure when you are buying your green salsa you buy the salsa verde.  There is also a green salsa in my store that I buy that is a pureed jalapeno salsa and is really spicy and a little bitter.  The salsa verde is slightly spicy and has a nice tang from the tomatillas.  I used yellow corn instead of white - but, otherwise made according to the recipe.",

The green salsa (I used medium) and green chilies really add a lot to the broth and taste of this recipe.

We all enjoyed this for dinner with a piece of homemade bread and everyone was happy that we had enough for leftovers. I did make this on the stovetop in a stockpot rather than the slow cooker.",

Anyway it just wasn't really what I wanted when I was expecting white chili and it wasn't fantastic enough to make up for the fact that I was disappointed it wasn't more like regular white chili.
