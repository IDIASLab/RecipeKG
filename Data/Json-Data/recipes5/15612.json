You shouldn't miss the tortilla chips because you have delicious black beans instead, and you still get the yummy spicy Mexican flavor and cheese. While not necessarily authentic, this salad is easy to make!  If you have time, it's is also wonderful topped with onions and maybe fresh jalapenos.",

I followed the suggestion of cutting the chicken into strips and pan frying in a little bit of olive oil (instead of baking), mainly because I was hungry and didn't want to wait a half hour :) After it was lightly cooked thru, I also added a half a packet of hot taco seasoning (my husband and I like a little spice) and put in a little salsa in the skillet at the end after the chicken was browned to add a a little more moisture.  (skipping the tomato sauce entirely)  I used a salad base comprised of some baby spinach, leafy greens and fresh herbs, adding more fresh cilantro to it.  I also added some diced onions and a half of a diced fresh tomato.  After topping the salad with the chicken I topped with a little (jar) salsa, the black beans, sliced avocado and a sprinkling of 2% shredded cheese.  I think adding sour cream would have (for me) spoiled this light, tasty and refreshing meal.  It is great and I'll make it again for sure.  So easy!",

This contains a few days worth of sodium. To make it with less sodium make your own taco seasoning leaving out the salt and use low sodium beans. Frying the chicken even in olive oil does nothing to make the recipe any healthier. Has too many carbs for those trying to watch that part of their diet. It is tasty of course as written just not healthy.",
