I thought it would be cheap and cheerful, and useful as a side to something, but it is absolutely delicious!  The combination of spices is completely spot on, giving a very rich and authentic flavour, with a good amount of spicyness, but not enough to hurt! Of course it tastes better the next day, as any curry does.\n\nThe only things I would change in this recipe when I next make it (As I definitely shall), is that I will increase the amount of potatoes by at least 50%, to six or seven potatoes, and use only an 8oz can of chickpeas.  The curry as it is, is more like a chickpea curry with potatoes, but I'd like potatoes to be the main feature.  I think this curry would be very good too with spinach in it, instead of the peas, although its great as it is! \n\nps. Im neither vegan nor vegetarian.  ",

It all started with the potatoes I needed to use up... when I came across this yummy sounding recipe.  I had no onions in the house, but I did have dried chopped onion, so I rehydrated them... I had no fresh garlic in the house, so I used the minced stuff in the jar (never as good as fresh, imho)... I had no fresh ginger, so I used ginger paste... I had no canned diced toms, but I did have tom paste... I had no coconut milk, but did have coconut milk powder to reconstitute...  I was infinitely surprised to have a can of peas, since I really don't care for canned peas at all (where did THOSE come from??).  In spite of all of my creative yet irreverent adjustments, this is one of the best curries I have ever tasted!",

I agree with other reviewers that this could have used more potatoes; it's pretty saucy. I wasn't in the mood for super spicy, so I used 1 tsp cayenne. I also reduced the curry to 1 tbsp, which was just right for us. Excellent over brown rice!",

Also, I'm not big on potatoes, now those are bland, so I used sweet potatoes and they are delicious. I also mixed up the veggies according to what I had on hand and added tofu. Wonderful!",

These spices are strong enough that I would cut these quantaties down to 1 t. cumin, 1-2 t. curry, and 1 t. garam masala.  The flavor will be there but prevent it from tasting too heavy which is what happens when you go overboard on those spices.  It will actually taste more flavorful with less (quantanty-wise) spices.  Also, you won't need as much salt (2t. is not healthy!) if you don't make the dish taste so heavy by going overboard with the spices.  More is not better in this case!
