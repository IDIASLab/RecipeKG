I did sub maple syrup for the honey and used less sugar than called for since my cranberries were sweetened--and I'd probably use even less next time, or use only the maple syrup without additional sugar at all, as I found them to be a tad too sweet for me. I topped a few of them with the cranberry/sugar/spice mixture, some with just cranberries, and some with just cinnamon sugar. I didn't care for the cranberries on top--as they got kinda hard and chewy while baking. And the additional sugar on top was unnecessary. For me, I would just sprinkle the tops with some cinnamon and call it good. I could see adding walnuts, pecans, or almonds to these as well! They took about 23 minutes to bake, and I got 16 muffins out of it. Thanks for the recipe!",

My alterations: I used 2 whole eggs instead of egg whites (because I hated to waste yolks),  added 1 cup chopped walnuts, increased to 1 cup cranberries (sprinkled with 2 TBSP more of the whole wheat flour after draining from hot water to keep from sinking in batter), skipped the ground cloves as I didn't have that ingredient, and skipped the topping. Made 12 full muffins that took 30 minutes to bake. Yum! Next time I may try less sugar.",
