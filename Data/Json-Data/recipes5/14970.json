The recipe doesn\u2019t specify what type of oatmeal to use, I used old fashioned.  I added quite a bit more boiling water as well as some skim milk to salvage it, but my husband still commented that it was like pudding.   BUT he also said that he liked the flavor.  Microwave temperatures vary, so you may want to start checking for doneness at 1 minute and every 30 seconds thereafter.  At least for my microwave, I know it needed a lot more water, so next time, I\u2019ll start with 1-1/2 cups water instead of 1 cup, and may even find that it needs 1-3/4 cups for 2 servings.  On the positive side, we both liked it, and I will make again trying to get the consistency to our preference for  oatmeal.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
