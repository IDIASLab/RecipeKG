It's adaptable for both for meat-eaters and vegetarians, and is great out of the oven and reheats well. It's a terrific dish for football parties and whenever you're attacked by the munchies. A vegetarian version of ground beef can also be used for the filling.",

Fold in the two opposite side corners and continue rolling the wrapper so it covers these corners, tucking them in. Dip two fingers in the egg whites and brush the remaining corner, pressing it to seal. Repeat these steps with a second egg roll wrapper.
