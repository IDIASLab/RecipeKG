I added celery and grapes which I love in chicken salad and it turned out great. I didn't have fresh tarragon on hand so I used dry tarragon (only used half of what the recipe called for since I used dry seasoning instead of fresh). The next time I make this I will not put in as much tarragon as the recipe calls for since I thought it was a little overpowering. However I am pregnant and that may be why I found the taste to be a little much. Overall this is a very good recipe and is easy to make.",
