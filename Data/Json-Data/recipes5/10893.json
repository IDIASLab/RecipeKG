The only thing I did differently was that I used Challenge European unsalted butter which was available at the regular grocery instead of going to the specialty store for Irish or Norwegian butter.\nI served it with salmon (like Chef John suggested) and sea scallops .  I seasoned the food with sea salt and black  pepper  then cooked it in a skillet with some more butter and a little olive oil.  It was delicious and could easily rival a dish from an upscale restaurant.  I will absolutely be making this anytime I make seafood or fish.\nThanks for sharing. Chef John:)",
