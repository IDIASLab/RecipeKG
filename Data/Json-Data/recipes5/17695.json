You put applesauce and whole wheat flour into a dessert recipe, it's going to change how it tastes, and you really shouldn't be one-starring recipes here if you didn't follow directions.  With that said, I followed the recipe as directed (go figure!) and ended up with deliciously crunchy sweet berry bars that were un-put-down-able.  The vote was unanimous - this recipe's a winner, and it's been requested for Thanksgiving. And again, people, please don't rate recipes poorly if you took artistic license with them, just don't say anything and chalk it up to a bad idea, ok?",

I followed the recipe as written except that I used a raspbery, blueberry, blackberry perserve combination instead or straight raspberry.  There is plenty of oatmeal/flour mixture to cover both the top and bottom of the bars, so no worries.  I would recommend stirring up your preserves in a small bowl before adding them to the crust; this will allow for easier spreading.  Also, do not spread the preserves all the way to the edge, but rather leave a little space so there is no burning.  I would also reccomend keeping an eye on them during baking time; mine were done at about 18 minutes...25 minutes would've been too long in my oven.  A yummy recipe we all enjoyed....thank you!!",

My only problem was that I couldn't use the outer 1/4 inch of the bars, since the jelly burned onto the pan, so I just cut around that. Next time, I'll be sure to spread the jelly so that it doesn't quite go to the edges.",

I used a fork to ease flattening the bottom portion into the pan. Even though the bottom seemed thin to me at first it did thicken upon baking. The jam to batter ratio is perfect.
