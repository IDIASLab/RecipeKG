I also whipped this together when I was out of barbecue sauce (and Tabasco) so added 1/2 of a finely diced chipotle pepper (drained off the adobo sauce) and used a sugar-free ketchup because husband needs to cut down sugar. Chipotle added a nice underlying smokiness to the taste I would recommend it. Simmered it for about 35-40 minutes because I needed it that night. It was quite good even the same day but was definitely a better sauce the next day worth the wait. It was a hit and will make it again. Thank you for adding it.",

The aroma in the house made us craving the pork all day. I used about a cup of it to cook the pork in and added more to the pulled pork when I served it. DELICIOUS! Why buy those expensive sauces with lots of additives when you can make a great sauce with ingredients I have in my pantry. Thank you Havicc.",
