                "reviewBody": "I made these tonight and I have a few comments... first my fault I should have drained the crushed pineapple better I guess because my batter/dough while light and fluffy was very wet. So the first cookie sheet I baked the full 10 minutes and took out becuase I was afraid the bottoms would burn. Well I shouldnt have worried - they were so underdone I had to toss them. The next batch I baked longer and increased the oven temp slightly - these turned out much better. The cookie doesnt spread hardly at all so if your \"rounded spoonfuls\" are not perfectly smooth the cookies will be rather odd shaped needing icing or something to pretty them up. All of that aside the cookie is just boring. I was looking forward to trying a new flavor/ingredient in my cookie baking but I am disappointed. The cakelike texture is fine with me as is the level of sweetness. But it's missing something. Maybe follow the suggestion of another reviewer to add walnuts or coconut. I probably wont make these again unless someone new reviews the recipe and has some suggestions on improving it.",
