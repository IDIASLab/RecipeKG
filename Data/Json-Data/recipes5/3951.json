Pasta primavera implies that fresh, spring vegetables are used--it doesn't really matter, specifically, what they are. I used what I had in the fridge--grape tomatoes, zucchini, red bell pepper, carrots and mushrooms. I sauteed the mushrooms with sliced shallots and fresh minced garlic in olive oil, then stirred in the roasted vegetables and pasta (I used linguine). Couldn't help myself, I had to add extra butter!  The fresh basil and parsley, as well as a good Italian seasoning blend, really contribute a lot to this dish. Perfect with our roast chicken dinner.

I substituted margarine for butter and served the cheese on the side. \n\nI would recommend adding more vegetables - I added about 1 cup of broccoli and 1 yellow pepper. I also added a lot more basil (approximately 1 cup of chopped basil leaves). \n\nGreat recipe to get you in the mood for spring and summer. Thanks!",

I forgot to top it with cheese at the end, and I didn't miss it. I didn't have zucchini or green beans so I doubled the squash and asparagus. I used Gemelli pasta--the little spirals and they worked great. For a recipe with so many ingredients, it ended up being really easy. The lemon and balsalmic flavors really made this dish perfect. Even great as leftovers! Great date meal, especially for vegetarians (my boyfriend's only complaint was no protein). I will definitely make this again, and bring it to my next pot luck!",
