I have discovered it is important to use flavors you truly enjoy as in a brand of mayo thats good..we like Kraft better than Best Foods or Hellmanns for instance. and same with bbq sauce we like Trader Joes Spicy alot.. also was careful to use fresh lemon juice I kinda hate the pre squeezed stuff and Farmland Brand Bacon done extra crispy in the oven. I know I sound picky but it makes such a difference! So mixed the chicken lemon juice celery olives and 1/4c crumbled bacon together and then made the sauce. poured it over all and let it sit overnight in the fridge. Before serving I mixed in the quinoa and the rest of the bacon. I gotta say we LOVED it. I think it would be fun to serve in hollowed out tomatoes but I just dished it out onto lettuce leaves. we had some sliced cucumbers and tomatoes bread sticks and a light fruit salad.. used a little lemon yogurt on blueberries strawberries and grapes. anyway it was an awesome little luncheon.. thanks so much!",
