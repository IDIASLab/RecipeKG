Even though I used a food processor it does take some time to prepare the sauces so if you want to save time prepare them the day before. I will also try ground allspice vs. the whole berries. For me biting into a whole allspice berry detracts from the enjoyment of this dish just a bit. My other personal preferences are to add 2 chopped jalape\u00f1os to heat the dish up a bit and double the Grand Marnier. I like the effect of the Grand Marnier and since it s boiled all of the alcohol is removed. Finally the cilantro really brings out the flavors. Don't leave it out!!",
