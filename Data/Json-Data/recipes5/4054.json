For a nice texture brown orzo to golden color in a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat then pour in water and boil it. Brown tofu first in oil then add onions and garlic. I also added shredded carrot and a chopped squash that had been languishing in the fridge. Mushrooms would be good too. Fresh basil kicks this into high gear (love it with the lemon!) and don't skip the lemon or feta - these two things make this recipe great! If you don't like/have feta fresh Romano is good too. Thanks for a wonderful beautiful healthy dinner.",

Keep in mind I cut the recipe in half (other than the tofu) I added 2 cubes of veggie boullion to the water in which I boiled the orzo to add some flavor.  I cooked the tofu, onion and garlic as directed, but also added zucchini and a jar of marinated artichoke hearts (chopped). Instead of tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes w/ garlic.  After I stirred it all together, I mixed in about 1/3 cup of parmesan and then sprinkled the servings with feta and parm.  It really was just fantastic, especially for a nice, healthy meal.  Thanks for the great idea!",

Oh and I fried the tofu before the onions to make sure I could get it nice and crispy without overcooking the veggies. This is a great quick meal to make after work. If you're not already a regular tofu eater make sure you press the tofu before frying. Even better if you have the time press the tofu cut into triangles and then FREEZE it until the edges are frozen. Then take it out and immediately pop it into the hot pan with oil. Provides for a much meatier chewier texture.",

One is that I am allergic to wheat so Orzo was out of the question--I used Basmti rice instead. I think that by itself was an OK substitution really. But then I actually had crumbled goat cheese in the fridge but not feta (which should authentically be made wtih sheep's cheese) so I used the goat cheese. That was not the best choice--it was an overpowering flavor even sprinkled lightly. We served the remainder from the Wok & did not sprinkle the cheese on top and then it was decent--delicate tasty flavors. But not a 5 star for sure and even without the cheese it doesn't meet a 4 rating. 3. My 3 year old liked the meal wtihout the cheese.",
