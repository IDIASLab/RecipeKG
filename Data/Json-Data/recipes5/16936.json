I removed them and sauteed my apples in some butter, adding in the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Once the sugar was melted, I put the chops back in the skillet and poured about half a cup of apple juice over it all, and placed the skillet in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes or so.  I added some cornstarch to the liquid about 10 minutes before it was done to thicken the sauce.  I added apple juice instead of sherry because I didn't have any and I'm also not too crazy about the flavor of wine or sherry in food.\nMy family really enjoyed it this way, even my picky 6 year old!",

I did brown the pork first, then cooked the apples in the frying pan I'd cooked the pork in.  I used the leftover marinade as part of the sauce--doubled the sauce too.  Then poured it all over the chops, cooked for about 45 minutes in the oven.  At the end I pulled out the pork and added corn starch mixed with sherry to the pan and cooked a little longer until it thickened.  I also made mashed potatoes and put the sauce over the potatoes.  It was fabulous.  Wonderful meal.  Thanks for sharing!",

First I seasoned the chops with garlic salt and pepper, then browned the chops in an oven-proof skillet, added the apples on top (also threw in some dried cranberries), sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon, dotted with butter and poured the sherry over all.  Covered and baked for 25 minutes.  I removed my skillet from the oven, removed the chops and kept them warm, while I thickened the sauce on the cook top with 1 T. of cornstarch and a little water (which made my sauce plenty thick enough).  I plated the chops and spooned the sauce over top.  My only issue with this recipe is the cooking time of one hour!  Way too long, IMHO!  Perhaps that\u2019s a personal preference, but even my 25 minutes was a bit too long!  Adjust the cooking time and you\u2019ve got a winner!!!",
