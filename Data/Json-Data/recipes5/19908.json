The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that that is waaaaay too much sauce for only 1 pound of chipped ham. I'm glad that I went w/ my instincts and 1/2'd the sauce part b/c it would've been a waste of the extra ingredients. Other than that these were very tasty had great flavor and I loved the convenience of using the slow cooker...I cooked mine on low for 3 hrs. and that was perfect. I didn't find these too sweet at all just right! Thanks for sharing this recipe...I WILL be making these again!:)",

My PA friends relocated here tell me that \"chipped\" ham isn't available here in Texas so I can't say how this would compare to what they are used to but I thought it was really good and certainly a keeper! Thanks for the great recipe this is delicious!",
