I baked the chicken legs in the oven at 350f for about 40mins (they were pretty big thick and meaty) basting every so often with the salsa sauce. Since I used a combination of salsa and picante sauce they were too spicy for me but Husband loved them. Served with a cucumber/corn salad and sweet potato fries. Not bad at all. Thanks Beverley!",

We grilled the boneless chicken breasts in foil packets. Used about 1/4 cup of the sauce and brushed each side of the breasts before sealing up the packets. Cooked on a med. hot grill using indirect heat. The center burner was turned off on our 3-burner grill. Cooked for 15 minutes then turned over & cooked another 10 minutes. Removed breasts from foil and placed on the grill basting with additional sauce. Turned after 2 minutes rebasted and left 2 more minutes. Removed from grill and let rest 5 minutes under a foil tent. The chicken came out perfect moist & juicy.",
