This vegan curry has lots of cancer-fighting ingredients like turmeric, ginger, garlic, and onion. You can make it in bulk and freeze. Add some greens like spinach, Swiss chard, or kale towards the end of the cooking time if you like. I serve this over a little bit of rice but it tastes great with pita as well or on its own.",
