Almond flour but also added 1/2 c. Coconut flour as well since many said the crust was oily.  I also added - little almond extract to the crust and baked the crust for about 5 or 6 minutes which made the crust more like an almond coconut shortbread.  I also added more almond extract to the filling. After they were baked I made a small hole in top and added a small dollop of red raspberry fruit spread.  They were absolutely delicious!",

So I halved everything since it was only me that was going to be eating this but I didn't read the directions carefully and ended up mixing the almond flour and butter into the recipe.   So instead of having a cheesecake crust I just had this concoction.  I decided to cook it anyway for 30 minutes then let it cool in the fridge overnight.  Tried it today and it was soooo good!  For my sugar substitute I used Truvia which  has erythritol as the main ingredient.  So if you didn't read directions well (like me) never fear, it  may still come out delicious.",
