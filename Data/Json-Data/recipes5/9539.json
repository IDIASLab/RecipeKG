I don't know whether it's the lemon juice, the combination of herbs or the marinating before hand, but I will NEVER make roasted vegetables any other way. You could pretty much substitute any of your favourite veggies and this dish would be a success. My husband AND kids raved about these vegetables (especially the zucchini!) Thank-you for this recipe!",

We used zuchinni, brocolli, mushrooms, red onion, red & green peppers, baby carrots, sweet potatoes and snow peas.  The stated baking time was far too long though....everything but the carrots were done in under 40 minutes.  Next time I will steam my carrots first and the roast them all for 30 minutes. I like to make a huge amount so there are leftovers.  Great in a pita or wrap for lunch or mixed with scrambled eggs.",

The lemon taste didn't blend well with the other flavors, but was nicer a day later on the leftovers.  Also, the bits of bay leaf were unpleasant.  If I make this again, I will reduce the lemon and oil (too rich for my tastes) and use whole bay leaves, which will be easier to remove.  Overall, a decent dish, but not too exciting compared to simpler versions of roasted vegetable.  (side note: for measuring simplification, 8 TPSP of olive oil is a half cup)",

I used eggplant squash zuchini green and red bell peppers red onions asparagus portobello mushrooms baby carrots and cherry tomatoes. I doubled the marinade because I had so many vegetables and left out the lemon zest so it wouldn't be too strong of a flavor. I baked it at 400 for 20 minutes stirred it and put it back in for another 20. We ate them hot because we couldn't wait but they are better at room temperature. Make extra- they are great the next day as a cold veggie salad added to a sandwich or wrap (try them on thick sliced french bread with gruyere cheese or in a pita with crumbled goat cheese) or mixed with scrambled egg whites for breakfast. Such great flavor- this is the best roasted veggie recipe I've tried yet! Thank you for sharing!",
