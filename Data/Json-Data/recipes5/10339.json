The cayenne definitely added a kick.  I added about 1/2 tsp. since it didn't say how much.",

I used a little less flour just because 1/4 looked like too much. I didn't have any heavy cream but half and half seemed to work just fine. I didn't add any cayenne pepper because my toddlers aren't big on spicy just yet. I did a few drops of Franks RedHot (a cayenne pepper sauce) to my bowl however.

The first time I made this recipe I followed the video recipe for it (found on this site and on Food Wishes).  I was so pleasantly surprised when the soup came out exactly as I thought it should.  I now make it every week or two and I am as happy with it now as I was back then.  Creamy and flavorful without being overpowering, it's everything I look for in a comfort food.   I do leave out the cayenne now, though it's tasty either way.  That's just my personal preference.  Don't miss the video.
