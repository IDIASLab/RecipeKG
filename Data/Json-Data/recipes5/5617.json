But that was the only change I made. I only gave this four stars because it was a little too much parsley for me and it seemed the other herbs didn't quite mix with the parsley. I put the herbs in a covered container and shook it to get everything to mix but the herbs stayed in the bottom of the container and the parsley stayed on top. But the fish still had a great taste and was verty moist and I would definitely make again but try to figure out how to get the herbs blended better before putting on the fish.",

So I used two of those cut in half. Also my pantry had both dried thyme leaves and ground thyme - I figured the former was more appropriate for this recipe. It did take me quite a bit longer to cook the fish though - maybe 30 minutes. A fairly simple dish but I enjoyed it quite a bit.",
