Eureka! I've found it.\n\nThe only changes I made to this recipe were cooking in a crockpot all day, and using one minced fresh jalapeno instead of pickled jalapeno. I soaked the beans overnight, then placed all ingredients in crockpot early in the morning and cooked all day. Fabulous! Mouth-watering aroma and rich, full flavor. Oh, and I also used a little fresh oregano from my garden instead of dried.\n\nThis recipe was very hot and spicy using one jalapeno. My family likes spicy food so it was great for us, but if you prefer milder flavors you might want to leave out or reduce the jalapeno.\n\nAbsolutely wonderful. Thanks, Kiki!",

                "reviewBody": "Fabulous flavor! I did not soak my beans and they cooked in approx. the given time. Beans that are old will take much longer to cook. If you don't live in a \"bean eat'n state\" like Texas, try to get your beans at a local Mexican grocery where you KNOW the stock will be freshest. Also, if you need to add water while the beans are cooking, make sure to add BOILING water. It's not going to help the cooking time to add cold water and drop the cooking temperature!  I always have a tea kettle of hot water going on the range when I cook ANY beans. I used Pacifico beer (a beer similar to Corona) because that's what was in the fridge. In fact, that's what's ALWAYS in the fridge! hahaha. (Make sure to bring the beans back up to a boil quickly when you add the beer, tomatoes, etc. and then drop the pot back down to a simmer.) My only modification was a large jalepeno, diced and a about 4 tablespoons of Goya Liquid Sazon (If you read most of my reviews you'll find that Sazon finds it's way into most everything!)If you can't find the liquid Sazon, most large grocery chains sell the packets... try it out! (I usually use one packet per cup of dry beans in a recipe.) I'm going to serve it over cooked, crumbled chorizo and top it with queso asadero and put it under the broiler until the cheese is melted.  Just scoop it up with some tostaditas and you have a meal..or an appetizer! Thanks, Kiki for a great recipe.... your abuela is smiling!",

I look forward to trying the recipe as is and anticipate a similarly wonderful result! I used a 6-lb can of pinto beans, drained and rinsed (this about filled my crockpot). I added one can condensed chicken broth plus 1 can water in place of the 2 quarts chicken stock and half of a 24-oz Dos Equis beer. I added the remaining ingredients as listed and let the whole thing cook on low for about 5 hours. I pureed about 2 cups of the beans in the blender and added them back to the crockpot to thicken the mixture. They were excellent served over brown rice or with cornbread. Nobody missed the meat!",
