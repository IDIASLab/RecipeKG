I didn\u2019t have celery, but everything else was in place. I ground the lamb and added it to the onion and leek that I had saut\u00e9ed in my cast iron skillet, browned it a little more, then added the other ingredients. Rather than use an extra casserole, I spread the yam mixture over the meat mixture already in the skillet. Then I followed the baking instructions. This is a wonderful recipe! The only thing I added was about a teaspoon of ground coriander with the cumin. I will definitely make this again!",
