These have been added to my recipe box TNT folder. Caroline you were definitely thinking outside the bag with these. Since my store only sells 9.75 ounce bags of Flaming Hot Cheetos that s what I used. Rather than trying to figure out the ratio of Cheetos to Vanilla Almond Bark Coating with the 9.75oz bag I used the entire 20oz package of vanilla coating. This mixture spread perfectly in a 13x9 jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper to be cooled before cutting. As my Grandchildren would say They are the bomb.",
