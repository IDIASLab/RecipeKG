I threw 2 chicken breasts in the slow cooker with a bit of chicken broth and taco seasoning the day before not having a clue what I was going to do with it when it was done. I looked around for what needed to be used up and I saw an open package of tostadas in the pantry. Did a quick search for \"tostadas\" and saw bd.weld's gorgeous photo of this recipe and had to make it. I love the sweetness of the mango with the hint of heat from the jalapeno. Super yummy!",

We enjoyed this very much. We will definitely be having this again. I'm looking forward to having it with more mango. Next time I'll buy two mangos just in case!",
