However, it's still pretty good this way.  Changes I made: Used more garlic, flounder instead of tilapia, diced fresh tomato, cayenne pepper (not too much) instead of red pepper, more red wine and less water.  In the future, I think I'll use even more garlic and cut out the ginger.  I like ginger, but I personally don't like it with these spices.  What I like about this is that the fish isn't the star of this dish--I think there's as much fish in here as vegetables; you could add more fish to this or cut it out completely and it would still taste good.  This seems like a good recipe to experiment with, change around, have fun with.",

My wife loved the spicy kick while my daughter thought it was too spicy.  She put some mild cheddar cheese on it to reduce the spiciness. It worked and she loved it. My wife put some \"Red Hot Chile Lime Hot Sauce\" on her serving. This added even more good flavor to the dish so I'd recommend that as well. \n\nSubstitutions:\n1) Marinated artichoke hearts with frozen artichoke hearts thawed in cold water. Chopped in food processor before adding to stew.\n2)2 tbls of wine with 1/2 cup of wine as recommended by other reviewer. Great idea!\n3)1 tsp of cumin with 1/2 tsp chili powder. We had no cumin but websites noted that chili powder has cumin as an ingredient and advised that we use half of the requested amount. \n\nOmitted:\n1) Green Olives - Didn't have any available but would have been omitted anyway due to high sodium content.\n2) Sumac Powder - This will be added to my grocery list so that I can experience how this powder actually impacts the dish.\n\nIf you have kids, I would recommend reducing the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp instead of the 1 1/2 requested or just omit. You would then be able to put the amount of flakes you desire on your own serving without having to worry about the spiciness.",

First, unless you can handle a whole lot of heat, I would strongly advise cutting the crushed red pepper down significantly.  I cut it from 1 1/2 tsp to 1/2 tsp, and it was still pretty intense so I now reduce to 1/4 tsp and leave crushed red pepper on the table for others to use if they'd like more heat.  Usually no one adds any.  Second, add more wine, if it's available.  Third, throw in a handful of golden raisins at the end. Fourth, reduce the couscous by half to keep a reasonable ratio of couscous to stew. Fifth, use veggie stock instead of water in both the couscous and the stew.  Sixth, for fish, I have had success with various flaky white fish: tilapia, perch, cod, haddock, and flounder.   I have no preference; I simply choose what is fresh and wild caught.",

As a Northwest native I'm not overly fond of tilapia and other freshwater fish (though it does hold up beautifully to this tpe of cooking) but I bought a whole bunch of it on sale so I was looking for a recipe to use it in that might make it more appealing to me. This one works. I had a hard time finding sumac so I gave up looking. I read on the internet that while there is no really good sub for sumac lemon pepper would be an acceptable exchange with paprika for color so that's what I did. I followed the rest of the stew instructions except I doubled the artichokes and used red bell pepper along with the green. When finished the broth was delicious but a little too sharp for me so I smoothed it out with some chicken broth. I made boxed garlic and olive oil couscous as the accompaniment. Thanks for the recipe - I'd also like to try it using cod or halibut.:)",

I wasted so much time on this for a meal that was not to my liking. My dad thought it was ok so did my mother they said that but nobody was begging for more either. Also they thought it was too much heat with the red pepper flakes but I didn't mind it. When you're dealing with fish and making stews and things out of it the balance of the taste has to be perfect and I the funny thing is I actually thought the strong flavors balanced one another I just didn't like them.",
