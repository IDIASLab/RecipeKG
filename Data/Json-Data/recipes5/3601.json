I run the onion, white wine vinegar, lemon juice, egg yolks, and all the spices through my food processor before adding them to the hot butter. Add the cream at the same time. One and a half minutes in the microwave on high is perfect. VERY IMPORTANT - WHIP IT EVERY 30 SECONDS! This will keep it smooth and very creamy. Otherwise the eggs will set and it will be lumpy. If you want it thinner, whip in a small amount of COLD water. I have never had anything but raves for this recipe. Enjoy!",

The flavor of this bearnaise is spot on without the time consuming tarragon reduction called for in a traditional recipe. Can't believe this takes 90 seconds. Be careful if you have a high wattage microwave though I stopped to stir mine every 15 seconds and 30 seconds would have surely scrambled the eggs. Also make sure you stop when the sauce has just thickened or else the eggs scramble and the sauce breaks. Mine was perfect after one minute and fifteen seconds.",

Chicken Oscar is one of my favorite dishes but this was my first time making the bearnaise from scratch...and I will never go back to the packaged bearnaise sauce mix. I DID make some changes to the recipe...I didn't have any white wine vinegar so I used brown rice vinegar. I also omitted the cayenne and substituted dried parsley for fresh. I used half and half instead of cream and I also used the stovetop method because I prefer not to use a microwave. When I tasted it it was a bit lemony (maybe from not having the heavy cream) so I added about 1 1/2 T of half and half and one more pinch of tarragon. This sauce was delectable atop my Chicken Oscar!",
