If you were just making a desert for a normal dinner night, or to host a few friends over, then a single batch will do you just fine for about 6 people.  Remember though- this was sinfully good so you might want to do a double anyway for second helpings and take aways.\n\nTips:\n~When combining marshmellows, pumpkin and milk in saucepan Stir Stir Stir.  Seriously- don't leave the stove, just stand there and stir on really low heat for 5-10 minutes.  It will stick, it will burn, it will lump if you don't.  \n~Even when this mixture is cooling stop to stir it every minute or so to avoid the \"pudding skin\" effect which will lump up your mix.\n~I used less than an 1/8 tsp of Clove, Nutmeg and Cinnamon for mixture for a double batch.\n~This recipe is PLENTY sweet from the Marshmellows.  I did as recipe stated and used the Conf. sugar in my whipped cream and I have to say it simply wasn't necessary.  If anything it made the mouse just a touch too sweet so either put less of it or skip it all together.\n\nThis recipe was super easy to make, quick, cheap and decadent.  It's something I will make again and again in a pinch.  Very light and fluffy- tastes just like pumpkin pie.",
