The ingredients were good and I was intrigued by the idea of using coriander since I usually use it only in Indian- or African-inspired dishes. I increased the recipe by 50% - except for the soy which I thought was a little too much. As I was reading the recipe I kept thinking \"What sauce? How is this going to make a sauce?\" I thought maybe there would be more juice from the chicken or something...Sure enough when my chicken was done I was virtually sauceless and ended up with a goo after I added the cornstarch. I added chicken broth until I had sauce consistancy - and even with that dilution I think there was too much soy. I strained the sauce because the bitty chunks in it didn't appeal to me. In the end with my tweaks I ended up with a pretty good dish. If I do decide to make this again I'll forget about the sauce altogether because the chicken really is fine on its own. If you want sauce you'll need more liquid than provided. Sorry this is so long. N R Thanks for your efforts simpson I appreciate the chance to try!",

I did make several changes because I thought I had everything to make this except the limes and ended up in the kitchen with very few of the actual ingredients(having an off day apparently) so I did some subbing. I had lime juice but no zest so I increased the lime juice. I didn't have the coriander but since curry powder has coriander I tossed that in instead. I had jarred spicy jalapenos so I just used them. I had skinless chicken breasts and didn't have sunflower oil so just used regular vegetable oil. I couldn't taste any lime like another reviewer said--the soy sauce overwhelmed it and it just tasted like marinated chicken with soy sauce. Good but I was hoping for more lime taste. The spicy jalapenos actually mellowed out in the marinade; they just made the sauce itself too spicy to really use as a gravy for the chicken. Bf loved it though; I made the recipe with the written serving sizes--6--and he ate 3 pieces of chicken (one with gravy). He liked the gravy as well just complained it was too spicy. It was a very quick gravy to make and thick and gooey. I marinated the chicken overnight. I guess I'm making it again but I might increase the lime and decrease the soy sauce because I really was looking forward to a lime taste. N R",
