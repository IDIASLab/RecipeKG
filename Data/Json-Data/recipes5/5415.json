I had some leftover Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon fillet in the fridge so I used that instead of the canned salmon. The golden raisins give it a little sweetness and the apple a bit of crunch and both really bring this to life and make it unique. If you're not a raisin lover I could see dried cranberries working equally well maybe even better. Winner recipe seajillian thanks for a new favorite!",
