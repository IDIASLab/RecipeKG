So I used a fresh cooked chicken breast I buy bone-in breasts on sale; cook them up; remove the skin and debone them; freeze them in separate sandwich bags and put into one big freezer bag; Miracle Whip Light dill pickle relish easier than cutting up pickles anyway! and the onion. I didn't have sunflower seeds but did have a trail mix called \"Cranberries and More\" that I use for a salad topping. I just chopped it up a little finer. It was WONDERFUL! The second time I added celery and a hard boiled egg and red seedless grapes cut in half. The third time I added chopped red onion too. I CRAVE this salad! It is truly the best chicken salad I've ever eaten! Thanks TARA!",

I agree this could be the \"kitchen sink\" or \"garbage\" chicken salad but Tara's basics make it incredible! This would go over well at BBQ's and gal pal luncheons! Next time I will try canned chicken (Buy one get one free) and dill relish. Thanks again.",
