The only thing I changed was using bacon instead of the prosciutto (I'm not a fan) but the rest was the same. Next time i might use a little more bacon because well it's bacon! I used 3 slices of thick cut bacon. This is a quick recipe that I will definitely be saving in my favorites! I loved the sweet & savory flavors together.",

I find that often, in recipes, the quantity of lemon is too lemon-y for me (and I love lemons!), so I often halve whatever they ask for and that usually works well. In this one, because of the balsamic vinegar, I just dropped it altogether. Everyone loved it so I don't think I hurt the recipe by doing so.",
