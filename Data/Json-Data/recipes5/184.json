I made one gluten free version and one regular. Both times I simply used toasted bread that I cut into cubes and added extra sage thyme marjoram and rosemary. The method is perfectly timed. Holiday tip: Make this a couple of days before you need it and refrigerate. On the day you need it bring it to room temp and pop it in the oven to crisp up. Awesome recipe thanks for sharing it.",
