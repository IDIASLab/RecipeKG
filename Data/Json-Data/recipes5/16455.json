I've been to 90% of the Chinese restaurants in the metro area I live in.  And hey--this stuff passes the test.  It's the first time I've tried cooking Chinese and I can't believe how easy it was.  Further, it turned out fabulously.  It's as good or better than most Chinese restaurants.  Here's what I did:  1) used champagne instead of white wine; it's what I had available, 2) absolutely double, triple or quad the recipe; if you don't eat it now, you will eat it later ... the recipe doesn't make very much unless you eat like a bird, 3) for my family, the hot level was perfect ... it was certainly hot, but not too hot, 4) the sauce WAS a little thick--I will try decreasing the cornstarch next time ... as it was, adding water worked for me too, 5) if you can't find chile paste at your local grocery store, check out almost any Asian grocery store--they will likely have many choices.",

I do make a few alterations though, which I find absolutely crucial:  Double the marinade and the sauce, add lots and lots of water as the mixture cooks - otherwise it gets really pasty.  I would say throughout the cooking process I end up adding at least a cup of water.  You want to make sure there's enough sauce to cover the noodles.  I also add several cups of chopped up veggies; usually red and green peppers, mushrooms and broccoli.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!",

                "reviewBody": "Ok ya'll I have made this recipe so many times now, I kind of know what goes in it without looking at the recipe. This is a great base recipe, without a doubt and if you don't like spice at all, I would still to this recipe exactly. \n\nNow for all you REAL kung pao chicken lovers that want the SPICE. You have to add A LOT more sambal or chile paste to make this even remotely close to something you've tasted before. I think I used almost a fourth of my HUGE jar of sambal to make this work. I would also marinade the chicken in it as well so you just an extra layer of spicy. I think it's the vinegar, but it completely mellows out the spice of it, so you definitely have to over compensate. \n\nAlso, you don't really have to measure. Most of these things are one to one or two to one, so it's actually pretty easy to figure out. I have done these plenty of times without measuring it out exactly and plenty of times with measuring it out and it turns out virtually the same. \n\nFinally, you need to double the sauce part of this recipe. The original recipe actually needs a little more sauce then is written. The only things I wouldn't double are the peanuts and the water chestnuts. In the original recipe there are far too many of those things that the chicken kind of gets lost. \n\nHope this is helpful to you from someone who has had this a bunch! :)",

(I used 1 teaspoon in the marinade and 2 teaspoons in the sauce.) A few extra notes: Use Chinese rice wine, like Shaoxing, and light (as opposed to dark) soy sauce, if you can find them. I also agree with some other reviewers that chili paste is probably better than chili sauce. Lastly, skip the water chestnuts and add a carrot, like they do in Beijing. The carrot provides a wonderful crunchiness and sweetness that balances nicely with the spice.\r\n\r\nTo solve the issue of there being too little sauce, don't cook the chicken separately; after the sauce has been warmed, throw the chicken and marinade in and stir constantly until it's cooked through.  \r\n\r\nTo make sure you've got enough food, try a few simple (and cheap!) Chinese sides like potatoes and green peppers (????? c\u00f9 liu tu d\u00f2u si), eggs and tomatoes (?????? xi h\u00f3ng sh\u00ec chao ji d\u00e0n), eggs and wood ear mushrooms (????? m\u00f9 er chao ji d\u00e0n), eggs and cucumber (????? hu\u00e1ng gua chao ji d\u00e0n)  egg drop soup, sweet corn soup, and broccoli with garlic (????? su\u00e0n r\u00f3ng xi l\u00e1n hua). \r\n\r\nIf you want to finish off the meal like they do in Beijing, serve fresh fruit: Fuji apples, pineapple and kiwi.",

                "reviewBody": "Very delicious my dish was not quite PF Changs but great anyway. I found only hot chili sauce in the Asian Market so I used that the apartment smelled wonderful. Problems I encountered were: The cornstarch in the chicken marinade started to burn and stick when I browned it and the cornstarch in the marinade itself was too much so instead of a sauce I got a thick paste to which I kept adding water(suggestion: use a little less cornstarch). Finally the sugar was not enough for my liking so next time I will use a bit more...otherwise really really tasty. My husband and I ate every scrap. Thanks.",
