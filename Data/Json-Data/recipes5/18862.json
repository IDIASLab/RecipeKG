Don't forget to add to the ribs in the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking, or else the high sugar content will scorch. Don't let the strong smell of vinegar scare you while cooking; the flavor of the sauce after cooking does not reflect the scent that fills the kitchen while cooking.",

I just wanted to share that in the spirit of continuous improvement recently discovered that the flavor is MUCH better using Yukon Jack canadian whiskey instead of the marsala. Sorry about giving myself 5 stars but had to place a rating to leave this note!:) Also wanted to say please do substitute where you want or need! Often I'm forced to use jalepenos because it's hard to find exotic peppers in cincinnati ohio. If you find something works better please share! I'm constantly subbing out things in other's recipes and love to hear what works for you. Thank you for trying my recipe!! XOXO Noelle",

I cut back on the sugar used no honey and as I didn't have molasses I tried adding a bit of unsweetened chocolate for the dark flavor. I used a roasted jalapeno instead of a poblano regular cooking white wine for marsala white and red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar plus a little chipotle with adobo for the smoky flavor...LOL it was a great guide for a fun BBQ sauce! And I was happy it didn't call for Ketchup (my apologies for making so many changes...I just didn't want to go to the store!)",
