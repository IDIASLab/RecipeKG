I think this recipe is slightly different from the one they used at work (they used grapefruit juice which would also be fun to try) but this recipe is outstanding regardless. I served it at room temperature on top of a pork shoulder that I cooked in the slow cooker for 6 hours with hawaiian sea salt and liquid smoke. This would be fantastic on beef or pork and plan to try the leftovers on steak this weekend. I'll be making this again!",
