I finally made this recipe after adding it to my recipe box almost a year ago. It was so easy to prepare...I've avoided making this food at home because most recipes I've seen are very complicated.  I got all the spices needed and a large package af naan at an Indian grocery for only $8.00, much cheaper than a regular supermarket, IF you can even find all of them there.  The only change I made was that I added flour and water  right before serving to improve the consistency because the sauce was very thin.  I also simmered it over medium to medium-low heat rather than low, because it just didn't seem to be cooking. I served it over a bed of steamed basmati rice.  It turned out wonderful...very authentic and unbelievably easy.  My husband couldn't stop raving, and he wants me to make it often. Superb!",

We're both huge fans of Middle Easter cuisine and this is a wonderful dish. For the previous reviewer I'd like to offer up a bit of advice as I've made this dish several times myself - it sounds as if you cooked the meat too long. I find that sometimes depending upon the cut of meat I use it takes even less than 25 minutes to cook fully. I cook only until the meat is just done and it comes out beautifully every time. Thank you so much Shazia I hope to try more of your contributions soon!",
