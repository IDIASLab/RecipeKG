I chose this recipe because even though I generally do not like casseroles, my husband and daughter enjoy them and I had these ingredients on hand. I made a few minor changes and it was fantastic, my husband ate 4 plate fulls and wants what is left for his lunch tomorrow!  I halved the recipe, used reduced fat cream of mush soup, added 3/4 cup of sour cream, I used 3 slices of kraft deluxe american cheese and about 1/4 of a block of colby jack cheese, some garlic powder and sauteed the onions in olive oil until tender. All I had was a packet of the new \"fresh\" smoked starkist tuna and it worked beautifully, no fishy taste! I undercooked the noodles slightly and after I mixed all the ingredients together I poured it into a greased casserole dish.  I mixed about 3/4 of crushed butterwheat crackers with a tablespoon or so of melted butter and topped the casserole with the crumb mixture. I added a grating of fresh romano cheese and baked at 350 until the top was golden (about 20 minutes).  I let it set up outside the oven for 5 minutes and served it. It is one of the few casseroles I have really liked, and that my family loved! Try it, and adjust it to the taste of your family, quick, easy and yummy.",

I also heated the soup, cheese, and tuna in the microwave before I added it to the cooked noodles in order to have it mix well, which it did fantastically!  This made plenty for four.  You could use any cream soup,and brocolli would be a really good vegetable too.  Even my 2 year old ate this!  Be sure to sautee the onions before adding them if you don't want them crunchy!",

But, there is something I do not understand about this recipe. HOW CAN ONIONS COOK IN 2 MINUTES? When I read the recipe and it said cook until the cheese melts I had a feeling the onions would still be \"CRUNCHY!\" So, I chopped them to a practical mince. But, they were still crunchy, as expected. If you are looking for a quick affordable meal this will work. It is as good as any oven baked tuna casserole and creamy. This is a dish I would make for kids but not adults, so if that is your intent it will work. However, I would pre-soften the onions slightly until transluscent before adding to the pot.",

I drained but didn't clean the skillet after the bacon, then added the butter and sauteed the Holy Trinity (onions plus carrots & celery diced small), before adding the soups (plus a half can of milk). A dash of celery salt and some sweet basil added nice complexity to the creaminess, and voila, even He loved it! ;)\r\nps forgot to add that I left the cheese out of the sauce and just layed it over half the topping - he's weird in that he's not big into cheese, so this way I got it, but he didn't have to.",
