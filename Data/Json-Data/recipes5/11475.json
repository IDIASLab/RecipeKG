Instead of leaving the onions raw I sauted them with one stalk of clerey. Since I didn't know what to do with the left over evaporated milk I used the whole can. Instead of American Cheese I used a Edam. It turned out very creamy and moist. Will defenetly make this again and again.",

I halved it and it still made tons..substituted bread crumbs for potato chips and topped it with sliced tomatos.
