So the addition of capers in this spread is a natural as is the dill. However 2 T. of dill is just way too much. I used 1 T. and it was still too artificially green and \"dilly.\" I used fresh chives and would have preferred fresh dill too (the market didn't have any that day). All in all the spread was good but not great. The final word is definitely include the capers use fresh chives fresh dill and a lot less of it and this spread will be much improved both in taste and appearance.",
