                "reviewBody": "These cookies are the best cookies I have baked to date so far. I have baked this cookie three times and there are a couple tricky techniques to make this cookie completely out of this world. \n\nFirst, it really makes a HUGE difference on the amount of grease you spread on the pan. More grease means the sides will bake quicker than the structural integrity of the cookie. I spayed the cookie sheet with Pam and then wiped excess off with a paper towel. This did the trick.\n\nSecond is the time and placement of the Andes mint chocolate. I admit I did have trouble trying to figure this one out. The solution is you first let the cookie cool about a minute or until the cookie looks pretty deflated. Second, you place the mint on top (logo facing down) and press it into the cookie. Try only on a few until you start to get a hang of it. Then when the sides look shiny, but the middle still have a flat surface. Take a teaspoon and lightly flip the mint. Then drag the mint on the inner rim of the cookie. After the cookies have finished their decorative process. Promptly place them in the refrigerator still on the tray. Placing them on a cooling rack only delays the initial chocolate hardening.  \n\nWell I hope this review and these key tricks helped. Happy Baking!!",
