I don't think we'll ever do roasted or fried potatoes without it again. Because it already is available in a jarred form I took that shortcut rather than the submitter's direction to use the actual duck skin and fat (truly I don't know where I would have gotten my hands on that anyway). As I knew they would be these potatoes were out of this world delicious - not so much because of the recipe but because of the duck fat itself. I will say that cutting the potatoes in such small chunks as directed in this recipe guarantees that much more duck fat flavored crispiness. Using a cast iron skillet helped that along too. I used leeks as one of the suggested alternatives to the green garlic (don t know where I d find that either) and just as I suspected the level of heat required to brown the potatoes was too high for the leeks and they tended to burn. I ended up discarding them. As for these potatoes fried in duck fat? Ohhhh yeah.",

The duck fat which is not nearly as unhealthy as most people assume gives these potatoes a nice crispy crunch and if you use a starchy potato like a Yukon or a Russet they develop a creamy inside. Duck skin and/or duck fat can be hard to come by but if you find them buy a little extra because you will be making these potatoes again!",
