My rendition: I braised chicken in chicken stock with my own mixture of hispanic seasonings (added brasing liquid to sauce). I used Poblano chili peppers, although I roast em, then remove seeds/skins. Also, I omitted the crm cheese & used Pepper jack cheese in chicken filling mix. Instead of using all that chili powder in sauce; I used 1tblsp + 1 tblsp of cumin and a small can of salsa verde. Only used 2C of chicken stock as sauce quantity seemed excessive. I had dry cocoa powder so used 1/4 tsp of that. Used immersion blender to puree the sauce after it simmered for awhile. My twist - stuffed peppers & then wrapped in softened corn tortillas. I baked in oven like enchiladas (lightly sauced with Chihauhau cheese on top. OMG, I mean, OMG! Cool way to overhaul your typical chicken enchiladas if you want to try it. Sorry for messing with the original post but...I wanted to play with this one.",

The peppers I found were about 6 inches and that would have made 6 rather than the stated 4 peppers. The recipe makes quite a bit of sauce so if you also find smaller peppers I would half the sauce. And that sauce!!! Just delicious. Next time I will cut down the pepper a little as I used red chili pepper and I could tell my guests thought it a little too hot. One other thing I found the recipe a little confusing about the amount of chocolate but I used 2 squares of Ghiradelli b/s choc which was 1 ounce and it was absolutely perfect. Will make this again soon thanks for a wonderul addition to the Mexican collection Kevin!",
