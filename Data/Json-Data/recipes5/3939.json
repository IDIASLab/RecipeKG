In fact I make a larger batch (separating the pita chips so that they don't become soggy) to use for lunch the next day. Regarding those pita chips sorry you can't replace the real thing with the store bought variety. The pita chips make this salad what it is and besides it only adds about ten minutes - including clean up! - to cook time. Just make sure to carefully watch the frying and only cook until pita bread is LIGHT brown in color. Remove from stove and let them continue to cook in the hot oil for another minute until they are darker. (If not you quickly run the risk of burning the bread.) I do recommend having all the salad ingredients on hand. In regards to the dressing if you don't have/don't want to buy onion flakes and celery salt just add more lemon pepper (although I find the crushed lemon or sumac sold in Middle Eastern shops to be better alternatives) and more white wine vinegar to give it that extra tang. This salad is a great match for beef dishes and we also like it for our Middle Eastern mezze night where we make this salad hummus and falafel. Thanks for the recipe.",

Surprisingly the mint did not overpower the salad and the various flavors blended together in perfect harmony. I added sweet onion because I LOVE onion in salad and some chick peas for fiber and protein. We also topped our plates with a few sprinkles of feta and I left out the pitas to make it healthier. WILL be a new staple weekend meal for my family. The preparation is time consuming but WELL worth the wait!",
