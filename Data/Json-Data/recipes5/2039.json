Ironically, it might be the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had. Without any other flavors in the way, all you taste is the sweet goodness of milk and cream, which I think is a revelation.",

The eggs cooked almost completely although I followed instructions--perhaps the heat (medium) was too high.  Most other Gelato recipes have the eggs tempered (slowly added) into the warm milk & cream rather than starting out with the eggs heating up with the milk and that has worked for me beautifully.   I  will revert back to that process. I made a double batch and had to throw it out.  :-((.",

I used brown sugar to deepen the color and give it a bit of a caramel flavor. Then I added Heath Toffee baking bits. Nummm! I also made a batch with mint extract and added little Andes mint baking bits. Just be sure to continue to stir while cooking the mixture. I have had no problems. Oh, one more thing, I just use all Half and Half  because that\u2019s all I have In my refrigerator( and it makes things simpler).",
