After it brewed, I stirred in the (Splenda) brown sugar, vanilla and my own homemade chocolate syrup. Honestly? This was heaven. I didn't have whipped cream for the top but next time I make this, I'll be sure to have it on hand. This was wonderful and quite a treat.

The 2nd time I customized it to our taste buds for a more robust taste: increased sugar to 1/2 cup increased cloves to 2 increased coffee beans to 3/4 cup... to die for. The 3rd time I ran out of whipped cream to I whipped 8 oz of heavy cream and mixed it with 4 teaspoons of sifted confectioner's sugar. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!",

It is delicious although I must say I think it must be an acquired taste. It's a very strong flavor. I scaled the recipe to 2 and because I did not have whole cloves or cinnamon sticks I used a little less than 1/4t ground cinnamon and a few shakes ground cloves. Good recipe.",
