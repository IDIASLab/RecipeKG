                "reviewBody": "These are great potato pancakes aka Latkas.  I used 4 large russet potatoes, about 2 pounds. Water and starch are the enemy of crispy potatoes - here are a couple of tips.  Peel and place the potatoes in cold water.   I grate the potatoes and onion using the grater attachment on the food processor.  Then back into cold water in the basket of a salad spinner.  Rinse well and change the water a few times to remove the starch.  Once the water is almost clear, let soak completely covered in cold water in the basket of the salad spinner.  Whisk the eggs, flour, salt pepper together.  Drain the potatoes and spin them dry, empty the water out of the salad spinner bowl - shake the potatoes and spin them again.  Mix the dried potatoes with the egg mixture - it will appear as if there is not quite enough egg mixture but don't worry, there is plenty.  Use tongs or a slotted spoon to scoop the potatoes out and into the hot oil.  Do NOT move the patties until the edges are crispy.  Flip and continue cooking over medium heat until golden brown.  Heat you oven to 170 degrees and place the potato pancakes on a paper towel lined sheet pan in the warm oven to hold while you make the next batch.  If you don't have a salad spinner, Chef John's method of squeezing and drying with paper towels works OK or use a clean thin cotton dish towel and wring them out with that.",

I use a clean dish towel and put half of the onion potato mixture in it and twist the towel over a bowl of cold water. After squeezing all of the water out over the bowl you will note a layer of white starch has settled to the bottom on the cold water. Carefully pour the water off and add the starch layer back into the onion/potato mixture. This pure starch will act as a binder to hold the mixture together during the frying process of the pancakes. Chef John makes the point of instructing you to remove as much water as possible and that it the key to light crispy pancakes. To not remove the water results in soggy latkes that are gut bombs.",
