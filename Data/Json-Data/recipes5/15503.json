Added black olives to the top layer. Reduced the beans to one can, but might try 2 next time. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!",

I browned my meat with some onion and about 5 cloves of chopped garlic (that was using restraint too!)added taco seasoning small can of corn 3/4 can of chopped tomatoes with green chilis would have added a can of green chilis alone but my 8 yr old wont do it. put tortillas on bottom of pan added enchilada sauce on top put a layer of meat mixture on then sliced mozzerella and shredded sharp cheddar and repeated with a final layer of cheese on top. It was really yummy and husband and child thought so too. 8yro had 3rds! Forgot to serve with sour cream and when we were done eating my hubby said it sure would have been good with some s.c.!! It isn't worthy of a 5 star rating though those are for exceptionally great dishes.",
