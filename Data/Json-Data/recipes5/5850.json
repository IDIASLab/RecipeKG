But much to my amazement it did! I processed to rice size pieces and then added to skillet with a tablespoon of sesame seed oil. Didn't have red peppers on hand so chopped a few carrots and added that instead. Then after the recommended 8-10 minutes or so I added in half of a standard tomato that I chopped. Finally I had roasted a chicken and had leftover lemon olive oil salt and pepper flavored juices and added that instead of recommend juices. Tasted amazing and can see this being amazing with ANY juices/spices/combos! I also added in a bit of fresh chopped cilantro just prior to serving for an herb and and b/c it was in my roasted chicken recipe as well. Overall was VERY pleased with taste texture and feel of this recipe!",

Removed from heat and saut\u00e9ed the vegetables with the addition of garlic for a few minutes. Then returned cauliflower back to pan.

Light but filling. Texture wise it is half way between rice & couscous although it may have been the blade I used. Oh and I topped with a dollop of sour cream. What I'm thinking now is to use my leftovers in a wrap - cheese hummus spinach...it's on tonight! Thank you so much for the recipe:)",
