First of all the only things that I changed were 1) I omitted the meat because I wanted a vegetarian-friendly side dish and 2) I just dumped everything in the slow cooker and let it cook on low for a few hours. AMAZING!!! I will be making these beans often because EVERYONE raved about them. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!",
