I think that it would be a big mistake to deviate from this recipe or make substitutions.     I think that a common mistake may be to purchase an inexpensive cut of tuna.    If you cannot find or cannot afford high quality tuna, make another dish.    Look for a tuna loin that is a rich and luminescent, deep, dark red.   It is critical that the flesh be clear and free of white striations.  This is soft sinew, safe to eat but with a a really unpleasant stringy texture.    This sort of tuna will probably be difficult to find in large chain grocers.    I get mine from Whole Foods or a local fishmonger, but not every community has those options...      I always use high quality frozen tuna if it is superior to the fresh tuna.",
