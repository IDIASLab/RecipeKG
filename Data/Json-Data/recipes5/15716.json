The soft taco, layered with a mixture of refried beans and cheese, act as a cushion to keep the crunchy taco shell, filled with taco meat and toppings, from breaking. It's fun for kids and adults, too! This recipe is versatile and toppings are a matter of preference. We prefer shredded cheese, sour cream, lettuce, hot sauce, and sometimes guacamole. Enjoy!",

It was easier to eat then a regular taco since when the shell broke during eating none of the filling fell out. I used onion powder instead of fresh. I tossed the water the uncooked beef onion powder and the taco seasoning all in at the start and it made a raw meat soup but once it cooked down it was so delicious. I used a lean beef so no draining of grease was required. That's the secret to getting the super fine texture adding the liquid from the start and breaking down the meat. I'm going to fix this again it was a huge hit here.",
