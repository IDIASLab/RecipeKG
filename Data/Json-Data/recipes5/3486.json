Boil carrots, potatoes, cauliflower, peas and green beans beforehand. Saute onions and garlic in butter/vegan butter. Add tomatoes/puree and spice and stir for another minute or 2. Add spice (PB masala) ginger/chillies and freshly chopped cilantro (1 cup) and stir for another minute. Add all pre-cooked, lightly mashed veggies, salt, and lemon juice. Cook on lowest heat for about 10 minutes, check seasoning and add lemon juice, spice, and salt according to taste. Cook on lowest heat for 20 more minutes to allow the flavors to sink in. Viola! Tasted pretty close to what I had on the streets of India!",

I made this along with the Roomali Roti bread that's on this site.   I  had my oldest daughter take the leftovers (there was alot) to the Indian store where I had purchased the spices.  They ate it for lunch and said I had made it better than some Indian women could and that it was delicious.  So the recipe must be worth 5 stars and tasty to those with the right tastebuds.",

This dish is great topped with additional fresh chopped roma tomatoes. The prep time was stated as 20 minutes however the chopping of veggies took longer than that. Perhaps the recipe author used a food processor? We found the amount of food to serve more than 4 perhaps 6.",
