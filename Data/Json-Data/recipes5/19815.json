We generally like spicy and thought this could have used more flavor. I will probably try it again marinating it next time and maybe tweaking the sauce.",

I also replaced the ketchup with pizza sauce to cut the amount of sugar in the recipe. Based on what other reviewers have said I marinated the chops in the sauce for about 30 minutes. It was good but I think when I make it again I'll marinate it a bit longer so the meat can soak up the flavours more. I used chili pepper but omitted the cayenne pepper because I don't like very spicey food.",
