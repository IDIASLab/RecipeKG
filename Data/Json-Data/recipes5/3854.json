I feel this would make the meat more tender.  I started to follow the previous reviewer and covered it in the beginning.  After 20 minutes when I went to baste, I noticed the sauce was still thin and worried about it remaining that way during the whole baking process.  So I uncovered it for the rest of the time.  The sauce thickened perfectly and was very tasty. Remember to turn ribs and baste every 15 min or so. I will definitely make this again.",
