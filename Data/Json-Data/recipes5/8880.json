As a personal preference- I don't cover any of my meats. I simply slow cook this piece of pork (skin side up)in a standard conventional oven at 325 for 1 1/2 hrs every 10 lbs. Marinate with adobo, sofrito, fresh garlic cloves, and sazon at least 8 hrs before cooking. Watch how tender and moist this well seasoned traditional meat will be. The crisp skin will be an added treat to savor.",

I substituted dried oregano for fresh and used only 1/2 as much; used regular chili powder instead of ancho chile pepper; redwine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and added a splash of margarita mix.      I cooked a 5 lb. pork loin roast so doubled all ingredients. It made it's own wonderful broth. I also ran out of time so cooked on HIGH for 4-5 hours. It was very tender and I served in slices rather than chunks.   This was very easy to prepare and my company and family loved it. I placed leftovers in individual containers and froze them for my husband to take in his lunch...he LOVES it!  ",

After cooking in the oven for two hours, the meat was dry.  I am old fashion Latin person and I am used to the old fashion way of roasting pork:  At my house ALL meats are quickly rinsed with lemon juice BEFORE preparing to cook (do not leave the juice on too long otherwise the acid in the lemon will start 'cooking' the meat).  The skin is first removed with as much fat as possible. The fat side is \u201ccrossed-scored\u201d (this helps to bleed the fat off the skin) with a knife and use the rub on both sides of the skin.  Place the skin, used to self-baste, fat side down on the meat, as you rotate the meat, keep the skin (fat side down) on top, until the last hour of baking, remove skin, place besides the roast, fat side up.  A HOME MADE RUB MADE WITH PLENTY OF GRANULATED AND FRESH GARLIC, LITTLE OREGANO (OTHERWISE THIS OVERPOWERS THE TASTE), SALT, PLENTY OF BLACK PEPPER, PIMENTON (SMOKED PAPRIKA)   RUB THE MEAT, CUT MANY HOLES INTO THE MEAT AND ALSO 'STUFF' THE 'HOLES' WITH THE RUB, SLOW BAKE 325\u00b0 F (FOR AT LEAST 4 HRS) .

I loved the convenience of using the slow-cooker instead, and it turned out just as good. I always cut into the meat and shove some of the garlic/pepper paste into it. Also, I put balled up pieces of foil under the pernil to elevate it a bit. This prevents it from sticking to the bottom and sitting in the grease. It came out very moist and delicious. Once you place the lid on it, leave it! Every time it's opened moisture escapes. I opened it after 6 hours and it was done. Remember pork is fully cooked at an internal temp of 170 degrees.",

I combined all the seasonings together adding Adobo and a cup of water as suggested by another reviewer. I did not have white wine vinegar so I used red wine and garlic vinegar instead. I also followed the recommendation to puree the seasonings and to stuff it into slits cut into the roast. I then cooked it in the slow cooker. Some of our family liked the roast with lime juice and some without. I liked it both ways. The gravy was good on-top of rice. This was easy and everyone loved it. This one goes in the recipe box.
