It was everyday food for us, but only during summer when Grandma, and then Mom,  grew zucchini in their garden. I feel for the submitter, because it's difficult to put this down in recipe form!  It's never measured precisely, and the ingredients are never carved in stone.  Add mushrooms, onions, and/or chopped tomato if you like, which is what I did today.  I use fresh garlic, not garlic powder (grandmas didn't have garlic powder!)  and not nearly as much Parmesan as the submitter directs - we use grated Parmesan at the table just like salt and pepper - just sprinkle it on to your liking.  I didn't need a recipe for this, of course, but I wanted to let others who aren't familiar with this know that this is the real deal in Italian households - no plain ol' scrambled eggs for us!  Times have changed since I was a young girl with so many fruits and vegetables now almost always available in our food markets. Now I can enjoy this profoundly nostalgic, simple plate of food all year round.  (Best, I might add, with toasted, homemade Italian bread!)",
