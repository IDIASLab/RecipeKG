I'd also add fresh mushrooms the last hour. \nI served it w/ mashed red-skins and baby glazed carrots (seriously!) The wine I used was Penfolds Shiraz Cabernet. Not only was it perfect for the dish, but a great wine to serve with the meal. Smooth, delicate, perfect!",

I followed the recipe directions for preparing the rabbit separately from the shallots red wine bouillon and herbs. I then combined it all in a crockpot along with some sliced carrots and quartered mushrooms. I also added more peppercorns than called for in the recipe. The rabbit turned out moist and tender. This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe. The first time I followed the directions and stewed it on the stovetop for 1 1/2 hrs. The crockpot method works just as well. About 1/2 hr before serving I took out the rabbit and kept it warm in the oven. Then I followed the directions to make the gravy and turned the crockpot on high. Gravy turned out great.
