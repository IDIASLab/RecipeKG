I used \"Texas Pete\" hot sauce (another western NC product!)instead of Tabasco and added a lot more than the recipe called for. I also eliminated the lemon juice. My family is used to the western NC sweet tomato based sauces I was afraid that vinegar plus lemon juice would be too too much! This sauce works well for grilling and marinating - I used it on chicken - but since it is thin you need to baste often to make sure the flavor is even.",

It does not have to be refrigerated for two days but I do it to let the red pepper flakes infuse the sauce before I strain them out. You don't have to strain them out but I like to put the sauce in plastic squeeze bottle so the seeds don't clog up the spout when I baste. Like Grammy Sue stated You can customize this recipe any way you like to PS If you don't want use the red pepper flakes then use 2 tsp of hot or mild new mexico chile powder. You will not have to strain the sauce if you use the powder",
