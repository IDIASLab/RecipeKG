A friend of mine was leaving the country for 6 weeks and I ended up with 5 bags of frozen peas from her freezer. This is a heavier, sweeter twist to traditional basil pesto. Goes well with pasta or spread over bread and covered with cheese...yum! Add more lemon juice, basil, or garlic to taste.",

As luck would have it, I happened to have a  bag peas that had been hanging out in the back of the freezer for months.  I tried the recipe as written and it was excellent.  I decided to tweak it to the \"gusto\" of my family, and I added a little more olive oil, red pepper flakes and salt.  My 3-year old just ate 3 spoonfuls right out of the food processor and he LOVED it!  This may become our basic pesto recipe from now on!!",
