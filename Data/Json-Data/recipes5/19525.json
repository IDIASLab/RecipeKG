I didn't have any honey so i took my 1/2 measurer and filled it almost all the way with light corn syrup then the rest of the way with a few T of maple syrup for flavor. The cereal gave a nice crunch the raisins made them a bit chewy and the peanut flavor was mild imo... I had trouble trying to cut them into bars since they were a bit soft and gooey; maybe the honey would have made them firmer! I may add some chopped peanuts next time as well! Thanks for the recipe.:)",

So before it expired I came on this site & looked up ideas of what to do with it so it would be eaten. I made alot of changes to this. I basically kept all the ingredients the same but instead of using raisins cause no one likes them I used cranberries (Ocean Spray) added more peanut butter & honey. I kept it covered in the pan overnight & put it on a cake board then used chocolate raspberry sauce drizzled over top. I then cut it into bite size pieces. Everyone loved them! The kids didn't suspect a thing (17&3 yrs) I'm sure u can more or less of anything but I'll be definitely be making this again & probably change up the ingrediants:) 5 Stars from me!",
