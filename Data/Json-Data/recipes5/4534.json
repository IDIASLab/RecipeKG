It got raves from my family. The chicken was unusually tender savory and piquant. I didn't have seasoning salt on hand so I improvised with salt garlic parsley paprika and pepper. Also I cooked the lentils for twice as long (approx. 40 minutes) as the recipe called for. There were a LOT of lentils but we'll eat them as a side dish after all the chicken is gone. Thanks for this great delicious recipe!",

I feel overwhelmed by the protein and fiber. This one needs more carbs!! Maybe some potatoes or noodles... Nah Not noodles. I think that this idea is sound but I don't like using white Balsamic vinegar. It has a harsh flavor and makes me think this recipe was just thrown together instead of thought out. I do like the use of fine chopped carrots though. Most people forget how carrots can lend a light sweetness to a dish that is not overwhelming and makes for a good addition for some easy veggies. Lentils are great but this one just has too many. Also think about how this could be cooked in a casserole dish instead of a skillet. I don't own a skillet big enough to accommodate this much food.",
