If I make it again, I may not use any oil at all, just the lemon juice, and I'll add more fresh herbs to the marinade.",

It's got the perfect mix of citrus/spice flavor (make sure to use fresh lemon juice---big difference in flavor). We added sliced cucumber in the pita & my husband had some deli purchased dill dip on the side but I wouldn't change anything on recipe itself. This was so good in fact that I'm going to use the marinade to make Greek Potatoes since the one offered on Allrecipes lacks any authenticity. Thanks Dave obviously we loved it!",

Make sure to use exactly the suggested amount of lemon juice or even less - it was a touch strong almost sour but I wasn't measuring exactly so it may be my fault - in short if you have very sensitive tastebuds go easy on the lemon juice. Other than that delicious and I agree with the other reviewer this would make an absolutely wonderful chicken marinade especially for BBQ. I didn't have any yogurt on hand so I substituted with sour cream - delicious and we also stuffed some lettuce in our pitas. Our pitas were falling apart so I can see why using tortillas instead would make sense. On the whole - flavourful and delicious - tastes Greek.. mmm...!",
