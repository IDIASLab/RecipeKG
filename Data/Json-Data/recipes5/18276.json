I added an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple that I drained the juice from, I added a 1/4 C. of shredded cheese, and I reduced the ketchup & brown sugar to 1/8 C and the mustard to 1/4 to 1/2 tsp.  I mixed it all together and heated in a saucepan and then I added it to the ground beef, pineapple, and cheese.  Then I used my hamburger press to pat out the burgers, and they were GREAT, moist and not the least bit messy with a five year old.  Thanks again, I will make these burgers again, and again, and again.  My whole family loved them.",

My experience has been that the recipes don't often provide enough of a twist to make investing in the new ingredients and process worthwhile.  Not true with \"Surprise Burgers.\" This is a truly interesting, awesome embellishment to the classic burger.  Though simple, the sauce is exceptional and compliments the sweet pineapple in a most appropriate and compelling way.  The only addition I made was my ubiquitous onion. I used two pounds of ground chuck and used a small, drained can of pineapple, which other reviewers have recommended.  Thanks for those recommendations! The crushed pineapple provided a taste of pineapple in nearly every bite!  Though I was working with a low-fat version of ground beef, the pineapple kept it moist.",

My boyfriend and I ended up mixing the brown sugar sauce (same quantity as prepared in the recipe) and some leftover crushed pineapple (about 2cups) into two pounds of hamburger because he accidently thawed out both pounds:D. They tasted wonderful sweet and tangy with pineapple in every bite. The moisture was just right and even with the sauce mixed into the meat the burgers stayed together very well. Served with some grilled pineapple red bell pepper rice and teriyaki sauce on the side this made for a recipe we're sure to make again. Thanks!",
