This isn't really up my alley and I was prepared to \"suffer\" through it but I LOVED it! I'm normally a crust girl when it comes to pizza but I loved the guts of this so much I forewent the crust! I used homemade crust (Jay's Signature Crust from this site previously frozen) to start and floured then dusted my pizza pan with cornmeal. I just can't do nacho cheese sauce so I spread a bit of salsa (I used Spike's Black Bean and Corn Salsa) and topped with some shredded cheddar for my base. I used a little less than 16 oz of shredded frozen potatoes (enough to cover the entire pizza) and subbed chopped ham for chorizo (just don't care for sausage though obviously chorizo would make this pizza if you like chorizo but the hame worked well too if you don't). I was a bit concerned about scrambling the eggs first as I like some runny yolk when I have egg on my pizza but they worked too. I topped with a Mexican bland shredded cheese AND a bit of shredded mozz/provolone. I had to bake well longer than 20 minutes (and upped the temp considerably) but that may just be our oven. This makes a really loaded pizza so one slice is quite filling. THANKS for the recipe!",
