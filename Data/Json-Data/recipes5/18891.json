But for my family's personal preference, I increased the brown sugar and butter to 3/4 cup each, added a teaspoon of vanilla, increased the butterscotch to 1 1/2 packages as my family likes more of the carmelized syrup.  I also sprinkle the cinnamon in the bottom of the bundt pan, then the pecans, rolls, butterscotch and lastly the sugar and butter mixture and another sprinkle of cinnamon.  Just to experiment, I rolled each \"ball\" in the butterscotch mixture and it didn't seem to make a difference after it was finished baking versus pouring it over the top as the recipe is written.  Let it sit overnight in the oven, set the timebake and walla it's ready to go the next morning.  What could be better than waking up to the smell of these rolls!  Thanks so much Jen for submitting this recipe!  This is definitely a keeper!!!",

They thawed very quickly, so that saved a lot of time.  Next, I added about a 1/2-3/4 cup of heavy whipping cream (I was cleaning out the frig) to the melted butter and brown sugar mixture, cooked on low until the sugar was dissolved. Poured over the rolls with pudding/cinnamon and then everything else the same! Cooked for approx 40 minutes. This is a keeper and I will definetly use it again!  Thanks Jen for posting!",

The bread was as expected of any roll made from frozen bread dough. My issue with these was temperature related. As Jen said be careful when hot as they will burn you badly if you try to eat them. The problem is that once they get cool enough to eat the 'sticky' sauce starts to get hard and is no longer sticky or gooey. By the time they are cool enough to just grab with your fingers and eat the caramel part is the consistency of taffy and way to hard to be enjoyable. I may try them again but possibly add a bit of cream or milk or even more butter to 'thin-down' the caramel sauce. I won't make them again as listed though. (It took hours to soak the sauce out of the pan they were baked in.)",
