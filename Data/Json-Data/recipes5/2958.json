My suggestions: (1)Timing is everything so I have all sauce ingredients pre-measured in small dishs ready to go. (2) Use more heavy cream in the sauce. Don't think you can use too much. (3) Use very fresh chives. (4) I prefer to finish the fish on the grill, versus the broiler. To do so, this is a 2 person receipe, so the fish and sauce finish at about the same time. (5) I'm partial to Jasmine rice on dishes with great sauces and it works well here. Just be sure to add some other vegetables for serving \"color\" to balance the appearance of the plate. Finally, don't worry about fat and calories. I do a long workout the next day everytime I make this!",

Looking over the recipe I was a little intimidated but it really was pretty easy. What I did to make it easier for myself was to separate out the ingredients. In one section were the ingredients to make the sauce then in another section were the ingredients to finish the sauce and in the last section were the ingredients to bread/crust the fish. Working through the recipe in sections like this made it way easier... Also before turning any stoves or broilers on or even before taking anything out of the fridge - mince your almonds and shallots. Oh and follow the part where it says only one or two minutes in the broiler.. I left mine in longer and burned some of the breading.:(",

I also changed the recipe a tad to make it more \"diet friendly\" by using fat free half and half instead of heavy cream used only the egg white for brushing the halibut and I substitued Brummel and Brown spread for the butter (I also cut the 10T down to 5T for the sauce). While I don't know what the original recipe tastes like my husband daughter and I all loved this with the exchanges!

It took an hour and 10 minutes; start to finish. I will make again. However will definitely use half the shallots 1/2 the vinegar and 1/2 of the butter. The shallots were overwhelming the sauce had sour undertones from the vinegar and I really don't think all 10 TBSPS butter was necessary either. Will BRUSH ON the oil/butter mixture and BROIL the fish (to save cleaning another pan) without the crumb topping and use the same pan to finish with the crumb topping.

As per other's advice I used Tilapia instead of Halibut ( 6.99 per pound versus 16.99 per pound for the Halibut)and saved a bunch without sacraficing any taste. Watch out - the sauce is incredibly time consuming but well worth it in the end. You'll probably need an extra pair of hands (like your hubby) to pull this one off. I served this over white rice from the rice cooker and balsamic asparagus. Give 30 minutes to make the sauce counting on starting the fish with your \"extra hands\" after about 25 minutes. Definitely keep the sauce in a bowl surrounded by hot water - this trick really worked. DOUBLE THE SAUCE RECIPE!!!! You'll regret it if you don't - the recipe doesn't make much and you'll especially want more if you serve with rice. I made this for 5 people doubled the sauce and used it all. Thank you so much for this recipe!",

Next time I will add less shallots (maybe 1 tbls) to help lighten the onion flavor since using less butter made the flavor very pronounced. We still liked it but some people might find it overwhelming. I think I will add a little more cream as well to help extend the sauce. I happened to have some chive cider vinegar that I used in place of chopped chives. I left out the lemon juice since some other reviewers had mentioned it was tangy enough without it and I agree with them. I don't think the sauce needed it. I didn't have any bread crumbs so I just used the minced almonds and egg for the topping. This worked fine. I really liked how the topping hardened and helped keep the fish moist while it broiled. It took about 7 minutes for my topping to brown and I had been concerned that my fish would be overdone. Not to worry the topping did the trick. The fish was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!",
