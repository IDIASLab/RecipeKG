I cut the salt by 2/3 and used a fraction of the fat--no fatback no shortening no olive oil and only 2 tbsp butter for the garlic--and a smoked ham hock instead of the bacon. Fabulous! I also add 3-4 lbs of cut up vegetables about two hours before its done. Carrots and potatoes usually but fennel chestnuts and winter squash are good too. The addition of vegetables might require more salt and possibly a little extra water.",
