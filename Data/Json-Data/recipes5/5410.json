I know restaurants do it all the time but just to be on the safe side I made a separate batch of the marinade to finish the sauce and crisp up the sage. I also used bone-in chicken breasts rather than turkey breasts. The sage contributed incredible herby flavor and the chicken turned out moist and tender with a beautiful rich color. As long as sage is plentiful in my wife s garden this is sure to make a repeat performance.",
