I decided to cook in the crock pot since everything drys out in the oven so quickly in Colorado. I also included the marinade in the crockpot for extra moisture and flavor after boiling it for three minutes in case of bacteria. I also added a 1/2 cup of water and set my crock pot for 6 hrs. It was perfect! I have never cooked with Liquid Smoke before and loved the flavor. My company loved it too!",

I cooked it for 5 hours in my slow cooker (which does tend to run hotter than I believe it should). I got a wonderfully tender brisket, without the usual mushiness that I get from cooking roasts in the slow cooker.  The flavor was wonderful, the texture was perfect.  It's a keeper!  The only thing I will try next time is to add pepper flakes or hot sauce to the marinade,",

I decided to \"stab\" the brisket with a sharp carving  fork and then a sharp knife to allow the flavor of the marinade to penetrate throughout the meat.  After having marinated in the refrigerator for about 18 hours I double wrapped the meat in heavy foil - placed in a roasting pan and baked at 225 for about 8 hours.  Let cool in the foil - then set aside to cool before slicing.  The juices were separated fat discarded and the juices boiled and reduced a bit.  Really good flavor.  Thank you",

I covered it with foil (and sealed it really well) and let it cook all day long.  It was so tender and flavorful...my hubby couldn't stop raving.  I have tried other brisket recipes before that we liked, but this one is definitely going to the head of the pack!  Thanks for posting!",
