This is a super wholesome salad with all-natural ingredients and no added oils or sugar. Try using quinoa instead of couscous, add warm asparagus on top, or stir in roasted, diced sweet potatoes and onions for even more color and nutrients. This keeps well for days - I usually make a big batch and have it for lunch through the week.",

I had to substitute fresh spinach as the store was out of any even remotely decent kale, but it was still wonderful! I mixed the olive oil, lemon juice, salt (and added black pepper) to taste, and drizzled it all over everything at the end. I loved the combo of flavors here--salty, sweet, tangy, fresh, and just plain good! Thank you for the recipe--I will definitely be making this again!",
