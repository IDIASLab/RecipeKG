The only changes I made were to marinate it in a freezer ziplock bag because I feel that coats the chicken better and to use garlic-infused grape seed oil in the marinade because I ran out of olive oil. This is a simple recipe perfect for a quick weeknight dinner. I threw the chicken in the marinade before the gym and cooked chicken for 10 minutes after the gym. I could have maybe cooked it another minute on each side for an even darker color but it was still very tasty! Served with a side of Thin Spaghetti with Garlic Red Pepper and Olive Oil (see other recipe from AR). I will definitely make this chicken again soon!",
