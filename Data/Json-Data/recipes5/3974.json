While the recipe makes a massive amount of dip (easily enough for 10 people IMHO) all we could taste was green onion. The flavour of the crab....everything in fact was lost through the green onion. I may try this recipe again and will cut it in half and I will also cut the amount of green onion in half.",

I replaced the cream cheese sour cream and mayo with both \"light\" versions and \"fat free\" versions. Both were equally good. No one seemed to notice. Fat free mayo however tends to be a tad sweeter.:-) Happy cooking!!!",
