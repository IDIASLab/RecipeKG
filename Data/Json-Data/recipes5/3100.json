Also I didn't want to buy grapefruit juice (who could drink a whole container of grapefruit juice yuck) so I used a combination of lemon lime and orange juices. I ended up using almost one the whole can of condensed milk and waaaay more than 1/2 the juice the original recipe called for. My advice - plan on using 1 container of cool whip one container of condensed milk and add juice to taste. I like it a little tart this is probably why I ended up using so much lime juice. Tastes pretty good! Sort of like key lime pie without the crust. I'm going to serve it to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day with some slices of orange.",

The first time i added 1/4 cup extra lemon juice going by another member's review (i replaced the grapefruit with lemon juice) and added about 2 1/2 teaspoons of gelatine as i found it very runny. I suppose this might have been because i used fresh whipped cream (you dont get frozen whipped topping over here. The second time i made it i made a pineapple mousse instead which turned out great! I used a tin of pineapples and used a cup of the juice inside the tin. Then i added 5 teaspoons of gelatine with just enough water to make sure that the gelatine dissolves completely. It was lovely! Also both times i added some orange essence as i found that the mousse smelled very 'cheesy'. It still had a slight hint of a cheesy smell but that gave a 'cheescakey' flavour which everyone actually liked quite a bit.",
