You could also add other favorite low-carb veggies like zucchini or yellow squash. I have a light appetite and use this recipe for two people. That saves two more crepes for another day to use for a different breakfast, or to use for dessert with berries and cream after dinner.",

I make regular crepes all the time and I had to make these very differently. I wasn't able to flip them as normal; I ended up cooking them at a medium low temperature and just cooking them through on one side. Even though I had a nonstick pan, I had to spray the pan before every crepe to be able to get them off the pan in one piece. Once I had it figured out they ended up being pretty delicious. We filled them with Breakfast potatoes and sausage.",
