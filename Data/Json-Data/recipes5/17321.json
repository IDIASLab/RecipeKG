But I did so it got 5 stars. The first time I made it I could find the sifter so I improvised but it turned out very dry. I thought maybe it was also because it just didn't get quite enough liquid. So the next time I made it I used a sifter and added an extra egg to it. Turned out great. Both times I made it I did add extra cinnamon also.",

It tastes (and looks) like a big chocolate chip cookie with fruit cocktail mixed in. It doesn't taste bad per se but I don't think the fruit makes it more appealing or delicious. I think it might be interesting to try making it with white sugar instead and maybe add milk instead of the fruit cocktail syrup. This way it would be more of a yellow cake with fruit mixed in.",

I cut the recipe in half so I wouldn't have a lot of leftovers to tempt me and baked in a 8x8 (or thereabouts) pan. It baked in about 20 minutes in my GE Advantium convection oven.
