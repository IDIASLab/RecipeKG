I was testing things that would be good for Lent and came across this recipe though I made a few changes to mine: Used 1/2 lb asparagus for one sandwich fresh mozzarella multi-grain bread and left out the peppers since I did not have any on hand. I didn't find it too messy but I only eyeballed and probably didn't put in as much lemon so it could spread better. I loved the texture of the mozz. with the asparagus and creating this with the peppers and a more flavorful cheese will definitely be on my list in the future. Especially with all of the possible variations this one is a keeper.",
