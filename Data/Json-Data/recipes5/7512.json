Shirataki noodles take some getting used to, but to those following keto, they are a welcome substitute for pasta. Make sure you follow the directions in this recipe on how to prepare them properly because simply taking them out of the bag and rinsing isn't enough. The flavors in this recipe are well-balanced and the shrimp is perfectly cooked. Even if you aren't keto, make this, and serve over regular noodles. You won't be sorry!",

This recipe was the first time I ever cooked or tasted them, and they were so unpalatable that I could not stomach this meal and had to throw it away without eating.  They didn't absorb much flavor and have a rubbery texture; not at all el dante at all.  I noticed the package instructs users to avoid using the noddles in spaghetti-style dishes because they aren't a good replacement for Italian noodles; which was my first sign this recipe would be a bust.  \n\nBased on the time and money I wasted and then not even being able to eat the meal, I have to rate this as a 1-star recipe.  I don't think there was anything wrong with the sauce or shrimp, just don't use miracle noodles!",
