Needless to say, they were a huge hit! They are based on a German cookie recipe and are different than American cookies - pretty dry and not very sweet as in Germany cookies are always eaten with tea or coffee. I'll be making them again as Halloween cookies.",

The dough in this case needs to be dry in order to hold the shape. They are intended as a \"joke\" cookie - you make a batch to bring to a Halloween party or your kid's class and everybody eats one cookie. Your kids will have a blast making them. My kids loved making them and eating them (but they are used to not very sweet cookies) but the main \"goal\" for them was to look like little \"turds\" and to be a fun edible project....not the type of cookie you bake when you're dying for cookies.",
