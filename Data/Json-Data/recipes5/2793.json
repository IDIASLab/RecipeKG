I made a few changes based on other reviews: Pounded the chicken, then floured it lightly (with plain flour), dipped it in the egg mixture then dipped it into the flour mixture.  I browned the chicken in butter and olive oil until done and placed them on a cookie sheet in the oven (250 degrees to keep warm) when they were done.  While they were in the oven, I made the sauce.  I doubled the recipe, brought it all to a boil (I added a little sugar, 1 tsp... helps cut the sour of the lemon), then added a little bit of cornstarch mixed with water to help thicken it.  I added the chicken right before serving... just long enough to coat it.  That way the breading didn't get soggy.  Everyone raved... it tasted like the one I order at my favorite restaurant!  Thank you Terry!",

I added lemon zest to the flour mixture.  I fried the chicken medallions (I cut the breasts in half) in olive oil and butter.  I also decided to use low sodium chicken broth instead of the bullion granules. I added 1 cup of white wine (doubled the sauce recipe) to the broth as well.  After adding the sauce mixture to the chicken, I used a bulb baster to siphon some of the sauce/broth off so the chicken was not completely submerged.  I simmered this extra sauce in a separate pan, also adding some lemon zest and cornstarch to thicken it (remember to mix the cornstarch in a small bowl w/cold water before adding to the hot liquids \u2013 otherwise the cornstarch will just pill/ball up and not dissolve).  I also added some to the chicken pan as well.  I added some capers to both the chicken pan and the saucepot too.  Finally, before serving I sprinkled some lemon zest on each of the medallions.  It was just great!  Many of my modifications were from other suggestions found here.  This is a great recipe to try.  Since you are zesting the lemon, try to use the fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Nothing compares!",

I used the chicken bouillon (some have tried the broth but I had it in my kitchen) but almost tripled the sauce recipe because I served it with angel hair on the side. I double coated the chicken with the flour as others suggested and even added slivers of fresh garlic to the pan while the chicken cooked (omitting capers because not a fan). To make the dish a little healthier I cut down on the butter and used some cooking spray. To keep the chicken from sticking I gradually spooned the sauce to the pan.

                "reviewBody": "Super yum! This was FANTASTIC. As far as piccata goes, this is probably the BEST I've ever made! Having said this, I did make a few \"tweaks\" which I feel enhanced the outcome. To start, I generously seasoned each chicken cutlet (I used thin cutlets instead of breasts) with s&p. In addition to the seasoned flour called for, I first dredged my chicken in plain flour, then dipped it in the egg / lemon wash and finally in the seasoned flour. I sauteed my chicken in a couple T of EVOO on medium-high heat and then set it aside (no oven) while I made the sauce. I deglazed my pan with 1/4 c. Pinot Grigio and to this, I added the juice of 2 lemons (FYI, a medium-sized lemon yields ~ 2-3 T juice - I used 5 T total), 2 T (drained) capers, 1/2 c. chicken broth and 2 T unsalted butter. To finish, I added my chicken, covered my pan and simmered on low for 20 minutes as directed (NOTE: the floured breading will help thicken your sauce, but you need to get past the ever so slightly soggy texture to allow it to work it's magic). Looking back, my only regret is not doubling the sauce. It was SOOOO incredible!!! I was literally lickikng my plate, hoping more would magically appear. :) Served with oven roasted red potatoes (Donna Lasater) and crusty Italian bread, this was an AWESOME meal. Thanks for sharing, TERRY! :-)",
