I agree with vegascook - too much flour. 1/4 cup would probably be enough to dust the shrimp. The next time, though, I may skip the dusting and just sprinkle some flour into the skillet to thicken the sauce.",

Regarding comments from other reviewers, I cooked the garlic and peppers for 20 minutes, as I thought this would infuse the flavor into the oil more, which it did.  I just had to adjust the temperature to ensure the oil did not boil and burn the peppers.  Also regarding the flour.  Next time I plan to sift the flour and use less, but I save the cooking liquid from the pasta and added about a cup back to the sauce to loosen it, I also added the pasta back to the sauce to finish cooking.  Next time I will add more olive oil and garlic but less lemon.  I may even experiment with finishing it with a tablespoon or two of cream.  All in all this recipe is a winner because the base recipe works and there are infinite modifications you can make to suit your taste that work as well.",

I used a combination of butter and olive oil to cook the bell pepper and garlic - for a few minutes, not 20.  Added a glug of white wine, no lemon juice and let that cook off a little and reduce before adding the tomatoes.  Cooked that for a few minutes, then added the shrimp, cooking them just a few minutes, NOT the total of 8-10 minutes the recipe directs you to.  Oh my, these would be some really overcooked, tough shrimp if cooked that long.  And don't bother to dust the shrimp in flour - there's just no reason to.  So, using a combination of butter and olive oil, omitting the flour and lemon juice, letting the wine reduce and cook off awhile  and only cooking the shrimp a few minutes  - quite simply stunningly delicious.",
