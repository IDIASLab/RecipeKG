I made a few changes to the recipe based on what I had at hand. Used vegetable broth a can of stewed tomatoes Cajun seasoning instead of red pepper flakes and dried chervil instead of fresh parsley. I also omitted the rice because my boyfriend wanted potato casserole instead. All in all the sauce was quite tasty but was ruined by the fish. I think if I had used store bought catfish or soaked mine it would have been wonderful. Mine was also quite runny but probably because I omitted the rice.",

I wasnt sure how long to soak it.. i kind of forgot about it in the refridgerator so it ended up soaking for 24 hours. I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes drained instead of chopped tomatoes.. i also added more onion and bell pepper... the recipe was kind of runny so next time i might add more rice and instead of 2 cups of beef broth just add 2 cubes of beef bullion thanks for the recipe and i will probably make again.",

Yat's restaurant in Indianapolis specializes in etouffee and other Creole dishes. This could have come right out of one of their kettles. Because I substituted canned tomato juice and all I thought it needed a little sugar and some cumin to mellow it out a bit. Recommend putting Tabasco green sauce on the table for those wanting to kick it up.",

We used chicken broth instead of beef (because we didn't have it) and added some Tony's Roux mix. We also used canned tomatoe soup (with onion salt olive oil basil) and a red pepper instead of a green bell pepper.
