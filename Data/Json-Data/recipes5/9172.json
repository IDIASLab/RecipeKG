I reduced the pumpkin pie spice to 1 1/2 tsp total and didn't measure the whipped topping when adding it to the top most layer. I was afraid I wouldn't care for the crust (especially because I'm not a huge fan of pecans) but it was PERFECT so please try it before you change it. This is one of those recipes you just want to keep eating. Dangerously good!!! **Don't forget to set the cream cheese & butter out to soften and the whipped topping should be in the fridge not freezer so it's easy to work with!**",
