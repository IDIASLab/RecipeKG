Put all the ingredients in a cheesecloth (thick paper towels to make two sacks would work just fine)and tie it with kitchen twine. This method keeps you from having to fish around the ingredients when it is ready to serve.  Slow cook on low for about 4 hours, stirring occasionally. This was so easy to make and the aroma that fills your home while it's cooking is just divine! Thank you!",

It smelled wonderful while on the stove, and the first few cups were good (or so I was told) but when I finally had a chance to get a cup, it had a very strong flavor.  Maybe the cloves or one of the other spices, but I think if I would have removed all of the spices from the pot after the first 20 minutes, then it would have just kept warm and the flavor wouldn't have been so strong.  I served mine with a dollop of whipped cream on top of each mug.  I will make again, but follow the recipe exactly.",

How can one drink be refreshing comforting spicy and sweet at the same time? Somehow Hot Spiced Cider gits er' done. This will be traditional Christmas fare for me. I can see myself rounding up the ingredients for this recipe whenever the snow starts to fly. I used my slow cooker. I wrapped the spices in a coffee filter and tied it with a rubberband. I turned the slow cooker to the \"high\" setting until it was hot enough then lowered it to \"warm.\" I don't particularly enjoy the clove flavor which can be somewhat dominant so I may reduce or eliminate that spice the next time around.
