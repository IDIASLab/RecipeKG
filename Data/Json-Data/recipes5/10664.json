I'm not going to go into the wild-versus-farmed salmon debate here, but wild is not only more eco-friendly, it tastes better and is more nutritious. You could use fresh cooked salmon for this recipe if you have leftovers, but since we are mixing this up with eggs and cracker crumbs, fresh salmon just isn't necessary, so why spend the extra cash?",

In this video he points out that this is a VERY basic recipe and he expects us to add things to our taste preferences-Onions, garlic, Worcestershire sauce soy sauce, ginger, Teriyaki, etc. This recipe will give you a basis from which to proceed. Remember, his favorite phrase is, \"You're in charge of your gravy!\". So play with your food and make it your own.",

I would just say that you don't have to take the bones out of the canned salmon.  The bones are soft and just disappear when you mash the salmon.  The bones add calcium to the meal making it even more nutritious;  I do remove as much of the skin as possible. Thanks for the great recipies!",
