Then I pour in the filling. That way each tart has the same amount of fruit/nuts.",

I replaced the pecans with chopped toasted coconut chips and I doubled the raisins. The recipe made 24 mini tart-lettes and 8 bigger ones with the tiniest bit of leftover 'batter'. I was a little concerned that the bigger tarts weren't cooked enough so next time I would cook them at 350 for about 25 minutes. Even after sitting for 24hrs the bigger tarts are quite runny when you bite into them. Of course some people might say that adds to their appeal! Overall a great recipe! I might add a few mini chocolate chips to the next batch! Update: I made a second (1/2) batch of these adding a few chocolate chips and using Tenderflake tart shells. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes. They could have used 2 extra minutes but I kinda love the gooey middle:)",
