I microwaved this dish, using 1/3 of the recommended cooking time.

I cut my sweet potatoes into thin fry shapes and tossed them in a bag with everything else. I did increase the red pepper, black pepper and salt too. I cooked them at 400 degrees on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes, stired them, another 15 minutes at 400 and then I broiled them for a few minutes to brown them slightly. After about 5 minutes of cooling time, my \"non-sweet potato eating\" family had already eaten a forth of them right from the cookie sheet. I served these with Mac and cheese (my families' favorite) and the sweet potatoes were gone before anyone even ate a bite of anything else!! I was informed by my 10 year old daughter that she wants me to make these for her friends at her birthday party! If that doesn't convince you to try this I do not know what will!",
