That aside I used about 8 red potatoes with the skins on and added a spoonful of FF sour cream when mashing the potatoes. I did heat the milk to almost boiling to make a fluffier potato. My family was divided. The husband and I liked this but the kids did not. I think it's a nice blend of flavors and quite different than your usual mashed potatoes. This went really well with Reunion Meatballs which are also from this site and garlic broccoli. I plan on using the leftovers tomorrow for breakfast by making them into fried potato pancakes.",
