'Didn't have concentrate but I'm sure it - or ham/bacon;D - would make this better. Good as is! Healthy too with less rice.  9.30.20 \u2018Used dried beans & homemade broth this time.  \u2018Not sure if half the thyme is still too much for me, or if we\u2019re dealing with one too many bay leaves; but still much better on Day2.  \u2018Could also be fresh bay leaves. :o Think so. :D  Four cups cooked rice is plenty.",
