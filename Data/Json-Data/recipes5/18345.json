These Bites are not dense like the Aussie Bites (I'm thinking about trying it and not putting in the Baking powder). So I did make changes (for all those who don't like that too bad). Because of the previous reviewer I only did 1/4 c. of honey and brown sugar. I didn't put in cinnamon or nutmeg. I did 1/2 tsp almond extract. And I added dried cherries and shredded coconut and a little bit of butter. I'm doing all this because I want it to be like the Aussie bites so I also thought I would put them in a mini muffin pan. I didn't expect them to rise though. But they did and they are mini muffins and they are DELICIOUS! My 2 year old tried it and came in two more times for more. I like this recipe and I might keep trying to tweek it to get some Aussie bites out of it!",
