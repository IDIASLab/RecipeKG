A couple things I did differently: I peeled and cut the yams into medium pieces put them in a microwave-safe bowl added 1/2 cup water and microwaved them covered for 12 minutes. This made it much easier. Also I halved this recipe. It was more than enough for 6 people. Another thing I did different was I chopped the nuts and mixed them up with the butter and brown sugar and then sprinkled that mixture on top of the mashed yams. This casserole had just the right amount of sugar and spices. It was perfect! My two kids (4&3) loved it too which was nice for me! I think I might try adding a little orange juice next time I make it and see how that is. Thanks Liza!",
