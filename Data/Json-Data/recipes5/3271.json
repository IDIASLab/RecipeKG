This recipe was a GREAT way to take advantage of the local ingredients. Thank you so much for sharing! I did make several minor changes: I punctured the eggplants with a toothpick all over then blackened them on the grill (it was 4th of July!) all over. Plunging them into a bowl of ice water made the black skins slip off easily. I also did this with 2 green chiles and added them in addition to the 2 fresh green chiles the recipe calls for. I doubled the garlic and increased the basil by about 50%. Lastly I used lime juice instead of lemon as that is what is local around here. The end result was a smoky garlicky spread remeniscent of baba ganoush (but better!) that we spread on tortillas and filled with other roasted local veggies from the harvest. AMAZING!",

My family and I used it as a dip but I also used it on sandwiches like I would with hummus. So if you are looking for something to do with this it is good as a spread with melted feta or Indian paneer and sundried tomatoes. I plan on making this again often and trying it on other things as well. I quartered the recipe and used half of a serrano chile--the dip ended up being very spicy so a caution: use less chile than the recipe suggests if you do not want a lot of heat.",
