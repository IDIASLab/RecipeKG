All other crisps I have ever made had sugar in that part of the recipe.  I made it as directed (melted butter and no sugar) and it was mushy, tasted horrible.  and was not crumbly as it says on the recipe.  So I threw that whole mess away and started the CRISP part over.  I used the exact same ingredients and added 1/2 Cup Brown Sugar to the CRISP mixture and DID NOT melt the butter.  The mixture then did get crumbly and when baked it was VERY CRISP.  Hope this helps.",

However the crisp part was very bland which may have been my fault because I added more flour as it was a big mushy mess. If I try it again I will add the sugar to the crisp part as the previous reviewer suggested. I also used mixed berries (blue straw & rasp) and that went great with Breyers vanilla ice cream.

It came out great nice and crumbly. Unfortunately my only complaint is that the apple raspberry filling was tasty but runny. I don't remember reading where any one else experienced this so I guess that it was something I did. The dish however tasted wonderful. I'll certainly try it again. Note: I mixed a little corn starch with the excess liquid and baked an extra 5 minutes. This \"thickened up\" the filling a bit. It still was a real hit!",
