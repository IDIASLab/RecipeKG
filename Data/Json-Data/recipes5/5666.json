I used three breasts only because they were enormous. Only other change was to use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh. I soaked my bamboo skewers in water before threading the chicken on. It's a very easy recipe. I felt kinda bad throwing away a whole onion though; maybe a half onion would be enough to flavor. I convect roasted at 350 for about 20 minutes; served with homemade naan yum!",
