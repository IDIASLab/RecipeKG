I make this dish quite often and usually marinate the meat with rice wine(if you don't have it you can use red wine or beer) and a cup of grated apple or kiwi or pineapple or pear first for a couple of hours before marinating it with other ingredients. This really makes a lot of difference. It makes the meat so tender and juicy.  Koreans usually use fruit to marinate meat and this way you don't have to put too much sugar. I also season it with salt and pepper ( a pinch of salt and about a teaspoon of pepper)",

Used that to glaze the ribs while they were on the grill.  DELICIOUS!",

This is a very delicious when bbq'd on the grill and I can always taste a hint of the ginger and sesame oil mixed in with a little sweetness to balance the flavor. I usually serve this with hot rice \"Kongnamool \" (korean soybean sprouts) and \" Korean-style Seaweed Soup \" all from this site. Mmmm...so tasty and fullfilling!! UPDATE: Family loved this as always gobbled this up in mere seconds licking fingers and smacking lips. The meat is so juicy and tender and has a nice sweetness from the brown sugar a hint of sesame oil garlic and ginger. Yummo!!!",
