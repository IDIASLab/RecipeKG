And I can tell you that to my surprise, this was REALLY good.  The only thing that I will do differently in the future is add quite a bit more spinach, and not saute it at the start with the mushrooms and garlic.  It wilts very quickly, so by the time the mushrooms are cooked, you\u2019re starting to get concerned that it\u2019s going to burn. Also, might cut back just a bit on the paprika (just personal preference here).  Probably will cook garlic and mushrooms for several minutes and then add in the spinach.  What\u2019s really interesting to me is what an important role the tomatoes play.  It\u2019s a totally different texture than the rest of this recipe, and that little punch of juiciness and sweetness works flawlessly.  SissyAnn, thank you for a very nice lunch today.  This was quick and easy to make, fresh tasting, and simply good!.",
