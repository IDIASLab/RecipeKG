When I took it out of the oven I thought I may have under baked it so I put it in longer but to my disappointment the Zucchini Bake is mushy ( not under baked!). I thought it would be solid and that it could be sliced into wedges and served but it was mushy. Acually it looked like seasoned oatmeal. not very presentable. And definitly not \"a colorful Vegetable casserole\" as stated! It tasted good my 6 year old liked it but I will not make again.",
