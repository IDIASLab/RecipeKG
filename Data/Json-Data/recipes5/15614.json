I cooked the burgers on my Foreman grill and dressed them w/lettuce tomato onion pickled jalapenos salsa & guacamole. I think this would make a great meatloaf. You could either add breadcrumbs to it or oatmeal to help bind this together. If I were making a meatloaf with this I would add some chopped up jalapenos anaheim chiles and/or some pasillas. I would also probably top this with a Mexican hot tomato sauce like El Pato (instead of ketchup that some people do with a traditional meatloaf)......",
