I had only blueberry Greek yogurt in the fridge so I used Dannon plain nonfat yogurt and let it drain for a couple hours in a paper-towel lined colander. Wouldn't say this is my favorite honey mustard dressing but to my surprise this is pretty tasty and a lot healthier for you than the one that I've been making. I will be making this again. UPDATE 2.18.17 Today I cut the recipe in half made this with 1 Tbsp each spicy brown mustard and honey mustard reduced the honey to 1 Tbsp and it was delicious.",

In fact I tested it on my husband who vows to never eat anything fat free (lucky him) and he didn't notice the difference - definite winner! This is one creamy dressing that you don't have to feel guilty about. Plus it takes so few ingredients that come together for something so tasty. This was a great little recipe to experiment with - changing up the type of mustard and subbing a little white wine vinegar for the lemon juice. I liked it so much I tried dijon and yellow mustard both with as much success as the spicy brown. All I added was a pinch of salt to taste. It was perfect over mixed greens cucumber thin sliced red onion and cherry tomatoes. This was so easy to make that I'll definitely be using it often! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I didn't have spicy brown mustard or honey on hand so instead I replaced them with maple syrup ( Which is 40 calories fewer than honey when measuring 1/4 cup ) and I used yellow mustard which has 0 calories. Now for each serving about 1/6 cup comes out to 27 calories per serving!!! Wuah Not to mention super delicious!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe!! Will use this again and again!!!",

I used mostly yellow mustard with maybe a tablespoon of spicy mustard--my personal preference. Next time I'll up the proportion brown mustard a little bit.
