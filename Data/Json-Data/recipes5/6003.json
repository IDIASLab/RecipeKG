I know that cornstarch sauces can be weird so I finished it with a pat of butter but that only helped a little. I think the peppers and lemon didn't work together. If I were to try again I would omit the pasta (and probably the peppers) and serve over rice. It's not likely that I'll make it again though. So many recipes so little time!",
