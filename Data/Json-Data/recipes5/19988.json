                "reviewBody": "These ribs are excellent. I believe it is because the rub is so good. For me I need to slow bake my ribs in the oven before grilling so the meat is tender falling off of the bone. First I removed the membrane from the back of the ribs. Rubbed the ribs wrapped them tightly in quality plastic wrap wrapped them tightly in heavy duty foil and refrigerated for a couple hours (preferably overnight). Take the ribs out of the fridge and let them come up to room temp (Do Not Unwrap). Preheat oven to 300 degrees and bake the ribs on a baking sheet for 2.5 hrs. Remove from the oven and allow the packet to cool enough to be handled. Preheat the grill to med-low. Unwrap the ribs making sure to get all the plastic wrap off which should be no problem if you use a good quality wrap. The plastic wrap inside the foil packet allows the meat to hold in all of it's juices steaming the meat while in the oven. When you transfer to the grill be careful to keep the rack in tact as it will be tender. Slather with BBQ if desired and grill on med-low for a few minutes on each side just to get that good grilled taste as the ribs are already fully cooked. Enjoy",

                "reviewBody": "The rub from this recipe gets 5 stars!  The cooking method wasn't quite right for me.   First - I remove the membrane along the bones - this is easy to do by using a sharp carving fork and sliding the tine of the fork under the membrane along a bone towards the skinny end of the slab of ribs.  Twist the fork and it will lift the membrane - then use a paper towel and grab the flap of membrane and pull it off in one piece.  I used Deli Mustard and the rub - wrapped in the heavy foil.  I would prefer cooking low and slow for a longer time.  At 40 minutes the ribs were not tender.  I moved to indirect heat at a low heat and let them cook for about 1 1/2 hours.   Next time I will do them in the foil in a 225 degree oven for about 2 1/2 hours - take out and let cool.  Finish on the BBQ with my favorite sauce, which right now is Black Pepper Sauce.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
