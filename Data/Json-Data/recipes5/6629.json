My grandmother made this years ago and I loved it:) I was reminded of it a few days ago and thought I would try to find a recipe when I came upon yours. The texture is exactly like I remembered although I used the almond extract. Not quite like Baba's but delicious nonetheless. I had to give some away to friends because I was eating it all;) Awesome!",
