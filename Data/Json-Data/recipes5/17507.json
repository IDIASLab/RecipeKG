Next time we will put it in a deep dish & layer the potato mash & then some of the coconut & suger & then potato again. Top with a bit more of the sugar mix & bake a bit to melt it. The sesame seeds can be overpowering in flavour so will use only a little. They sure tasted good though.",

The also need more sweetness to balance the \"kick| (if added )And give more flavour. The coconut adds a nice bit of texture but not much flavour. I didn't have the poppy seeds to roll the balls in. I also agree with the commenters about adding flour. The balls are too soft and mushy without anything to firm it up. The small amount of cornstarch does nothing at all to thicken the mixture. I gave up on stuffing the balls after a few attempts and just rolled them into the coconut. My own bad was not paying attention to the recommended temperature and then keeping that temp steady. Overall a decent recipe that could be better with some tweaks",

Maybe I shouldn't have boiled the sweet potato because it was wet and mushy after cooking and mashing and there was no way I was going to be able to shape it around the coconut and brown sugar. I had to mix all of the first 6 ingredients together and add a lot of flour to be able to make anything that was firm enough to even resemble balls. They weren't too bad after frying (they looked like little donut holes) but the inside was still mushy potato. I would rather have had donuts.",
