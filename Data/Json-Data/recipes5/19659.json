We like our kraut dishes a little more tangy and less sweet so I only used 4 apples that I shred instead of slice and about 1/3 cup brown sugar. I also use the larger jar of kraut and I like to rinse it and then add a tablespoon of olive oil and a 1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds. This gives a nice hidden flavor that goes well with the sweet and the tangy. Everything else is the same. I'll offer small hard rolls cut in half for those folks that want to make a sandwich out of this.",
