If I had one minor critique it would be in the addition of the heavy cream early on in the sauce. Letting the heavy cream boil made the sauce break a bit--so in the future I would add it at the end of the cook time instead. My chicken breasts were also kinda big so they took longer than the time listed to cook. Other than that this is a delicious chicken dish! Thank you for the recipe!",
