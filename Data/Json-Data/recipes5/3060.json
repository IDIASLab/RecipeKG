I used cream of asparagus soup and added mushrooms instead of the cream of mushroom soup. I also crushed up some sour-cream-and-chive flavored potato chips and sprinkled them on top. Also left out the tapioca. I didn't see the purpose of it. My husband loved this dish and said that it is definately a \"keeper\". Will make again when we crave something creamy and comforting.",
