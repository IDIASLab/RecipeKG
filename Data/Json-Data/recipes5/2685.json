Anyway, made it the night before.  I had three cans of cinnamon rolls, so I made 1 and 1/2 recipes.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  Only negative is that some places on the bottom tasted a little scrambled egg like -- nobody complained and everyone ate it!  It rose nice and high, so was impressive coming out of the oven.  Frosting, cinnamon rolls, pecans -- you can't go wrong, really!  I might cut down on the eggs by one or two next time.",
