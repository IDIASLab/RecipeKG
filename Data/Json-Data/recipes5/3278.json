I loved that there weren't a whole lot of ingredients so it was very easy and quick to make. I made everything as is except I halved the dressing. Just thought it seemed like an awful lot of dressing for only one head of lettuce and the half dressing measurement worked out great. Can't wait to try it again and will most likely use it as a side dish usually but it was wonderful as a main dish too! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.",
