I decided to experiment and discovered this amazing vegan cheese sauce! My entire family loves it, even the non-vegans! Excellent on macaroni, over a baked potato, drizzled in a burrito, on taco salad, as a veggie or chip dip ... the possibilities are truly endless. I hope you enjoy.",

                "reviewBody": "I absolutely LOVED this recipe I would ve never though too To use banana peppers and the brine it really tasted so close to actual cheese. I seen the previous reviewer gave 3 stars because they said it was too thick. Now I did do some minor alterations that turned out great and creamy and smooth first I added water to the mix which is ideal to make cashew cream and milk basically so you could make it into a cashew cream first then add all the ingredients. I also added almond milk as well because I was making mines for a baked macaroni so I needed it to have that cheese sauce texture. I doubled up the recipe as well to make more and I would suggest others do this as well. I added 2 tablespoons of tapioca flour and refined coconut oil to thicken it and to make it come to a solid when baking which made it turn out marvelous. I added more nutritional yeast then recommended. I roasted my own red peppers instead of getting canned ones and I didn t chop it up I got a high powered blender so it took care of all that for me. I also added some gram flour (chickpea) & turmeric only a little not too much blended on high turned into a huge success next time I m going to add more water and either agar agar or kappa carrageenan and turn it into a solid. Thank you so much for the recipe??",
