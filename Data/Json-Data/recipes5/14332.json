It has a Southwest/Tex-Mex feel to it to me and so next time I might add some beans corn cilantro black olives and top with tortilla chips. Regardless I will make this again and play around with more ingredients. Thanks for sharing!",

I would t even know where to find fresh chili s in my area so I used a 7 oz can of diced chili s with the juice. We also added beans and corn because our toddlers love them. Because of the barley corn and black beans I used 4 cups of stock instead of 3 and it worked well. They are also obsessed with sour cream so a dollop went on top. This is an amazing recipe even before I added the extras at the end!",
