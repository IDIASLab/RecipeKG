Like all braised dishes, tougher cuts with lots of connective tissue work best, and on a chicken that would be the thigh/leg section. Of course, someone will ask if they can use chicken breasts; please don't. They just will not add that sticky goodness to the braising liquid that the thighs will.",

For some reason got it in my head that it called for boneless, skinless chicken thighs and actually made a special trip to the grocers for them. It was still absolutely delicious and there was no fat to skim during the final reduction and no bones to deal with while gobbling it down! So tasty we licked our plates!!\nJust made this again last night. This time I used the chicken thighs with bone and skin on. I forgot to buy fresh thyme so used about a tsp. of dried.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and EXACTLY like last time it was absolutely, plate licking delicious!",

I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of switching out dried thyme for fresh because my small town grocery does not carry it) and I wouldn't change a thing!  I was nervous about the red wine (I know a crucial ingredient) because I do not like red wine, and even as it was cooking I was thinking I wouldn't like it.  Boy was I wrong!  This dish couldn't be more perfect!  Everyone in the family loved it, even my five year old whom is very picky about what meat he will eat!  I am happy I have wine leftover because I cannot wait to make this again!  Fancy enough for company, simple enough for a week night meal!  Thank you Chef John for an amazing meal!",

The red wine reduction sauce was amazing which gave the mushrooms and chicken a wonderful acidic sweetness.  Served this on top of garlic mashed potatoes as recommended by Chef John.  Oh and one more thing:  remember to wear a kitchen mitt when you lift the pan to transfer the sauce on to the chicken.  You don't want to burn your fingers on the pan handle like I did!  Very easy to forget that the handle is still considerably hot from being in the oven.",
