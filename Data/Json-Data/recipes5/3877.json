I made the following changes: (1) used regular (not quick) brown rice and cooked it all on the stovetop for about 50 minutes, til the water was absorbed and the rice was soft. I adjusted the water/rice proportions accordingly (3/4c rice and 1 1/2 c water).  It didn't seem necessary to me to turn the oven on when I could do this on the stovetop, though it did mean watching it a bit more closely. (2) Added about 1/8t cayenne since the curry powder I used is quite mild.",

I started it in the skillet and just put the whole skillet in the oven covered in foil to finish it so I didn't dirty 2 pans. Do stir it often.

This turned out really good (other than my mistake of using regular brown rice and it didn't get done in the oven the first time I made it) I made it again today cooking regular brown rice all the way on the top of the stove before mixing it into the rest of the recipe and into the oven... The first time I made it for 9 others and they all liked the flavor... in the future I would always cook the rice on the top of the stove before mixing into the rest... another thing I would do is to mix up the rest of the recipe the night before and let it marinade the chicken... plus makes it so easy to stick in the oven the next day and dinner is done!!!
