We would have our crepes rolled with butter and brown sugar inside.  Then you put some brown sugar on the side and drip some black coffee into it, but don't make it too runny.  I even loved it as a kid.",

For you tea lovers like myself: I made this in a mug to pour over waffles...I boiled some water and placed an apple cider tea bag in the mug with brown sugar and just poured enough water in to make the syrup stirred then let it steep for a few minutes. Ended up with apple spice flavored syrup!",
