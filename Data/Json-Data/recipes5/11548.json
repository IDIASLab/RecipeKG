I make a double batch every time, and like other reviewers make the beans the day before. I feed 5 teenage boys and they all love this. It's healthy too which is great. I follow the recipe exactly except I don't have/use the minced jalapeno. Any kind of sturdy toast will do. Don't forget the lemon and Parmesan cheese, it makes the dish! Thank you for this amazing recipe! :) My boys have also skipped the egg and put these beans over rice and loved it that way too. So versatile!",

ABSOLUTELY amazing!!!! definitely going to make this again! also great to make the beans ahead of time (like the night before) so all you have to make in the morning is the eggs and toast.
