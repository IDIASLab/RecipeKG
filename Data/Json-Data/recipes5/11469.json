I made my pie crust Pie Crust IV from this site. Then I sliced 3 large tomatoes. I layered half in the crust sprinkled with salt and pepper and then layered half the onions. Repeated with the rest of the toms and onions. I made the topping with Miracle Whip because it was all I had. I thought the cheesy topping was wonderful. This almost tasted like a gourmet type of pizza. The tomatoes get very runny in the pie but when you slice it and put it on your plate it's not runny. Most of the juice stayed in the pie plate which I just dumped out. The only change I may make is too add some green olives next time (I love them and add them to everything) and maybe add some minced garlic to the cheese topping.",

It came out very goopy and did not taste properly cooked even though I let it go 5 minutes longer than suggested fully drained my tomatoes and let the pie stand for 10 minutes. I also felt that it was very bland. If you still feel you must try this I would recommend the following adjustments: 1) the pie crust does not cook through during the cooking time which can be fixed by pre-cooking just the crust for 10-15 mintues or until lightly browned; 2) the onions although I sliced them very thin were practically raw. I would recommend sauteing them first before putting them into the pie. I think this recipe might be salvaged by mixing two eggs and some crumbled bacon in with the cheese/mayo mixture and increasing the cooking time by about 10 minutes or until the top is golden brown.",

A simple recipe with simple ingredients but intricate flavors and textures. The only change we made was pre-baking the crust (I used a Pilsbury frozen it has the perfect amount of salty/sweetness) for 12 minutes and make sure the tomatoes and onions are VERY thinly sliced.",

The only drawback was that the mayo/cheese topping was quite goopy when I cut into it but looked fantastic. I tried to stick it under the broiler to stiffen it up but it didn't work. I did use regular mayo instead of no-fat though and that may have made a difference. I will definitely make this again but perhaps add an egg and some milk to make a bit more of a quiche just to firm up the top. Even so I will still make it again Yum!!",
