This will keep it from sticking. Start with a Tablespoon of filling in the center of each square. Some filling is likely to escaqpe during baking but that's par for the course with turnovers. These are delicious \"as is\" but I decided to top mine with a spiced maple glaze drizzle.",

I made them as the recipe said (except for using canned pumpkin) and they were perfectly spiced perfect consistency...I can't wait to take some for a get together or something. I used the Pepperidge Farms Puff Pastry which made it easy to cut into nine squares and required no flour on the parchment paper--just thaw out cut out spoonful of the pumpkin mixture and you're good. None of my pumpkin mixture came out of the edges...but I used my fingernail to pinch them down good and I didn't overstuff them...for me less than a Tablespoon worked better. For the reviewer that wanted more details the puff pastry in the grocery store actually says \"Puff Pastry\" on the packages so I'm not sure where the confusion came in regarding Fillo Dough. Also the recipe just calls for 1 cup of pumpkin so probably any of the can sizes at the store would work as would using fresh pumpkin which is what I used. You just need one cup not a whole can.:) Hope this helps. Thank you for posting this scrumptious recipe--you helped me broaden my horizons as I've never used puff pastry before. I sure will now!",

They turned out full size and with a few extra cooking minutes-just really nice. I also read the reviews and used an orange juice concentrate glaze on them. I made apple pie filling ones with cinnamon glaze. It's important if you use a glaze though to not make it frosting thick because the pastry itself cools really fast and won't so much melt the glaze the way a sweet roll would. If your glaze is too thick it will depress the top of the pastry. A slightly runny glaze works best. I think it would be really fun to try these with Lime Curd with some sort of pommegranate glaze for Christmas.",
