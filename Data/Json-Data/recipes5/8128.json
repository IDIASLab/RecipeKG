I cut the recipe in half and it still required me to use my large (14\u201d) iron skillet to fit everything and there was still  plenty. The cooking times I thought were a little long. You should simmer 15-20 min covered and then remove lid and simmer about 15 min more. I used the optional tomato pure\u00e9. Also the ingredient list includes fresh tomatoes but they are not included in the directions. Just toss them in with the eggplant and zucchini. Make sure to use Herbs de Provence! It\u2019s what makes it taste so good! I sprinkled with Parmesan cheese to guild the Lilly!",
