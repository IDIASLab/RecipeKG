Perhaps using a little less beef or a little more sauce would help to intensify the flavor.  Also, the onion and celery should be sauteed with the ground beef in the grease that accumulates before it is drained off.  The onion and celery do not become tender in 3 minutes of cooking it with the dry beef. Decent flavor, but would be better if flavor was more intense.",
