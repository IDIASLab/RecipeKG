My family expects it.  I use Catalina dressing only, and I add Doritos to instead of plain chips (nacho flavor is the best but you can use any flavor)  I also omit the sour cream and add black olives.  Instead of putting the dressing with the meat, I mix it all except the dressing and the Doritos, then mix while serving so the chips don't get soggy.  Delicious!",

We omitted the beans. We did add water to simmer the meat. Then we had chopped green onions, chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese, bagged, shredded lettuce, salsa and sour cream to build our taco salad. We had fritos instead of tortilla chips. I sat out the Catalina dressing so that everyone could control the amount. We used fat free sour cream, cheese and catalina dressing. We tried to make this as healthy as possible. This was delicious!",
