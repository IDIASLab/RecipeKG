But the meat came out tender moist and very flavorful so it really didn't need anything. For the last hour we threw in small golden potatoes cut in quarters after soaking them for a bit in water. They came out yummy crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Next time I may soak them in beef broth to see if that enhances the flavor. But this is definitely a recipe we will serve again!",

                "reviewBody": "This \"Bacon-Wrapped Leg of Lamb with Red Wine Reduction\" recipe couldn't be better: the outcome was a top-notch gourmet treat! I tripled the rosemary (1 tablespoon instead of 1 teaspoon) and added 2 minced garlic to the olive oil-lemon juice-rosemary marinade (in addition to the 3 called for in the recipe for studding the lamb) since I like highly-seasoned food. I removed the fat and membrane only from the inside of the lamb leg and put that side up. I wanted to leave the fat on the outer leg and put that on the bottom to keep the lamb moist. I added some potatoes and leeks to the roast pan while the while the lamb was cooking and later browned them under the broiler. Before making the sauce I yelled to my husband \"You won't believe how incredibly good this is!\" There were no hard brown bits in my pan: only lots of lamb stock seasoned with rosemary and garlic with undercurrents of the subtle flavor of leeks. It was so tasty and the bacon-wrapped presentation was so beautiful that the next time I make this recipe I will only be making it to the end of this step (5 stars at this point). I added the wine and was immediately disappointed. I thought that I had ruined a perfectly good dish: all I could taste was wine (it covered the taste of the garlic rosemary and leeks). I grumbled as I proceeded to make the recipe as written and was surprised that the final outcome was another gourmet treat (5 stars at this point as well). Thank you LilSnoo for sharing your recipe.",

Someone had suggested roasting this with potatoes and carrots. So I added 2 medium/largish carrots 4 small potatoes and half a medium onion sliced. When the meat was done there was a lot of liquid in the pan instead of just \"drippings\" (I guess the liquid came from the veggies?) Worried about too much liquid I omitted the broth and used a beef buillon cube instead. I also used a port for the wine which is sweet. This came out amazing. The sauce is to-die-for good. My family gobbled it up. I don't make leg of lamb often but this will be the go-to when I do!",
