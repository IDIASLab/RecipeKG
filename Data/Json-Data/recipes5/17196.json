Poke small holes in the bottom of 1 pan along the sides, then place that pan inside the other disposable pan that has a small ball of foil in the bottom (so the bottom of the top pan won't rest on the bottom of the second).  As the meat cooks, the grease will drain down into the second pan, leaving the first one, and the meatloaf,  fat free.  Works for me.",

I put each into mini loaf pans, however the grease filled the bottoms of each one.  Perhaps if I had shaped loaves and place them all into a 9x13 pan like the recipe said, maybe the outcome would have been different (honestly I don't think so though).  Also, the flavor of the sausage was so overwhelming, that the flavor of the parmesan/ritz crackers (which I love in food) was completely covered.",
