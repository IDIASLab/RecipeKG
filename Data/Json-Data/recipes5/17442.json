I think next time I will add another 2 cups of popcorn because I like a little more popcorn to syrup ratio. I found it was easiest to cover the corn with the syrup if I put the corn in a square baking pan and poured the syrup over it. The syrup goes straight to the bottom and in a regular bowl it's hard to get the stuff from the bottom to coat the top. I used spray crisco to coat my hands so the syrup wouldn't stick to me and it was just fine.",

I had planned to \"test drive\" three popcorn ball recipes tonight(the first had melted marshmallows and I didn't like it) but I like this one so much that I'm going to go ahead and make the last batch the same but with grape. I didn't have any problems with the balls not sticking together you just have to spray your hands with no stick spray first. I think around Christmas I'll try the same recipe but melt red hot cinnamon candies in with the sugars!",
