I doubled the cinnamon, but except for that, I followed the recipe. I used light brown sugar but I think dark would give more flavor and a deeper color. Since I needed crumbs and not cookies, I just rolled out the dough and did not cut it in pieces. Big mistake! The outside got crunchy but the middle remained chewy. So I cut the middle part in pieces and put them back in the turned off but still warm oven for 5 more minutes, and I got golden brown, crispy crackers. The crackers were not quite as nutty as store bought (I guess that's why other recipes use whole wheat flour) but they were a good enough approximation. Next time, I'll use a bit less sugar, although this is a matter of personal taste. Thanks, Steph, for the recipe.",

I also added a little extra cinnamon, half a teaspoon of salt, and a teaspoon of honey. The batter was quite sticky, but don't let this discourage you! Just keep flouring the surface and the rolling pin.  I did have a problem with the crackers only getting brown at the corners when they were in the oven, so I took those out and put the rest back in. It may just be my oven. Also, I recommend you poke holes in them with a fork before you cook them so they don't get any bubbles.  I also topped them with cinnamon sugar... I made a mix in a bowl and used 3 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  They turned out not too sweet and not too bland, in other words \"lagom\" for all you Swedes. At least that is how I felt.  Be sure you don't leave them in the oven too long. If they start turning a darkish brown (before a dark dark brown) then they will taste a bit burnt. You want them to get golden! I'm thinking about trying them with cocoa powder next time. =)",
