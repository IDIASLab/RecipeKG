I used it on ribs and I am sold - all the other recipes I have for BBQ sauce are out the door as this one is the one I will use for ever! I would like to offer an update to a couple comments received from the reviewers. 1) This is a sweeter sauce feel free to reduce the amount of brown sugar; may even consider replacing some of the brown sugar with honey.  For those with a concern of it being too thin, I have placed it on the stove bringing, it to a boil then simmering until you get your desired consistency.  ",

Everyone raved over the pork bbq; I just placed a pork loin into the crock pot, poured the bbq sauce over, and let it cook for hours.  Made a side of homemade coleslaw, and we were livin'!

I have jsut tried it and served it with Baby Back Ribs- I doubled the recipe because there never is enough sauce.  Here is what I canged:\nUsed Myers Dark Rum- excellent flavor and color, and I added an 8 oz can of drained crushed pineapple.  No juice- just the pineapple.  Simmered for 30 minutes, cooled it and used it.  Superb!!!!  A new favorite.",
