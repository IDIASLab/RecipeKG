In addition to the lemon juice i added the zest as well..(i tend to do that with anything now that calls for lemon juice)I chopped my garlic into rough smaller chunks and used a sprinkle of Greek seasoning. I didn't find there was a need to marinate these in a bag..i just tossed them around in a bowl and placed them on my sheet let them sit like that before popping into the oven. Next time i may broil at a higher temp just to get some more brown edges. Thanks for the nice refreshing way to cook green beans!",
