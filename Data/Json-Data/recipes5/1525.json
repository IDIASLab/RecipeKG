It has a great Southwestern flavor with a spicy kick to it, and is very easy to throw together as it all cooks in one pot. It is also good topped with low-fat cheese and/or sour cream after serving into bowls. Serve with a salad, rolls, or tortilla chips.",

I also didn't know if I had a pot large enough to hold all of it. For our own preferences I used about equal amounts of carrots potatoes and chicken. My chipotle seemed very big so I minced half rather than the whole thing. For us the spice was just right. Near the end I was disappointed that the sauce was so thin so I did mix a bit of the sauce with some cornstarch to make it a bit thicker. This is a keeper.",
