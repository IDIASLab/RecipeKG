Cinnamon nutmeg cloves anything like that would also be yummy. They're probably great without any additions though. They spread ALOT! I dropped 1/2 teaspoons full and only put 6 cookies per baking sheet. I baked them on parchment paper for 8-9 minutes took the parchment paper off the cookie sheet and onto my countertop to cool them quickly.",

For my oven the cooking time was too long so the first cookies were slightly burned. 7 minutes seemed to be enough for mine but every oven is different. If you use only a teaspoon of batter there are way more than 30 cookies here. I stopped after 48 but there was still batter left. Served for dessert with freash strawbeeries and blueberries and vanilla bean ice cream. Thanks for the recipe!",
