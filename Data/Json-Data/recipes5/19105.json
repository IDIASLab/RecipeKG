When I took the salad to the holiday dinner I increased the recipe to serve 12 but I still made the dressing according to the recipe for 6 and there was plenty of dressing for the larger amount of salad ingredients. This is our new favorite salad recipe. I was a little hesitant when I started pricing walnut oil at the grocery stores but I saw it at three different stores for 3 different prices ranging from 3.99- 11.95. I would definitely use the walnut oil and not substitute another type of oil. I can't wait to find more recipes calling for walnut oil. It really adds a nice touch.",

I can't stand the flavor of maple syrup anywhere but on my pancakes.  This dressing was excellent, unique and complimented the ingredients of this salad perfectly.  This will be made often.

I don't keep walnut oil on hand so I use olive oil in the dressing and it is just fine. I make this as a main course by adding about 1/4 cup dried cherries or cranberries torn rotisserie chicken that I pick up at the store and serve it with a baked sweet potato. For the candied pecans I use the Spicy Mixed Nuts from this site. It's an easy and delicious meal that doesn't keep me in the kitchen after working all day.",

First, we double the amount of salad because the amount of dressing this makes is way too much for just one bag.  Or we refrigerate the unused dressing a air tight container.  Second, I don't use the red onion.  Third, and most importantly, I just use 1/6 cup of apple cider vinegar or the flavor is overwhelming.  Oh and baby greens or spring mix are the best mixes for this salad.",

I did not candy the pecans. Just roasted at 375 for about 6-8 minutes. I had to switch the cheese to feta for one person and I think blue cheese would be better but for those who don't like blue cheese this is still a great option. I also used light mayo but did buy roasted walnut oil and pure maple syrup for the dressing. The second time around I don't think pure maple syrup is necessary. And EVOO could be fine as a substitute for the walnut oil but maybe not quite as good. It makes enough for more than two salads but I can't wait to eat some tonight with dinner. Really yummy. It may be my new go-to salad recipe!",

I made the recipe as is with the exception of roasting the pear slices in the oven. It's a little extra work but I think the flavor and \"wow\" factor are definitely worth it! I thinly sliced the pears sprayed both sides with olive oil from a can (or you could brush or toss with olive oil) and layed them in a single layer in a 9 X 13 baking dish. Cooked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes turned and cooked for another 5 minutes. Those are the times that worked in my oven but I would suggest keeping an eye on them. I cooked them until they were tender and just beginning to brown/caramelize. I fanned four pear slices out on top of each salad for a pretty garnish and delicious flavor! This salad is AWESOME. You feel more like you're eating a dessert than a salad. I did have leftover dressing but it didn't last long. Yum!",
