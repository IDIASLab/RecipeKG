I changed the recipe to 4 servings and made the following changes: black olives instead of green, lemon juice instead of lime juice, and 1/2 can refried beans in place of cream cheese. I made these changes because of what was in the pantry at the time. Besides we like refried beans with our chimis. (I warmed the sour cream and beans slightly in microwave to make mixing easier).  I also used pepperjack cheese, which gave it a nice kick. Also after rolling them up I sprayed them with cooking oil and baked on a cookie sheet for 12 minutes in a convection oven at 350. They were nice and crispy and right before serving I poured the sauce over. Very Very Good and WILL make again. thanks for a great recipe.",

Leaving 2\" of the tortilla dry at the top and bottom.Leave the SIDE 1 & 1/2\" dry. Fold the botton of the tortilla up first, then carefully fold the sides up. Roll over, making sure you keep your fingers on the bottom edge of the tortilla. Gently lay/roll the chimichanga into the hot skillet, folded side down. Fry 3-4 minutes on each side. Always use TONGS when turning your Chimi's. It's really easy and the crispy texture of the tortillas is fantastic. Best of all, NO MESS!",

The rest we did various things - baked as is baked with non fat spray butter and baked with brushed oil. We could not tell a difference between the baked varities but we preferred them over the fried in oil!!! Healthier too! Also as others said- too much cheese! We didn't even use 1 package of the cheese it called for. But still I would say use only half of one bag (so use 1/4 the cheese that the recipe calls for unless you love cheese.)Would make again using these adjustments only!",

                "reviewBody": "Overall this was certainly a crowd pleasing recipe! I used a store bought rotisserie chicken that made making this so quick and easy. One tip I would suggest is to watch the temp of the oil. The oil should be hot enough to brown the tortilla but not too hot so that the tortilla browns too quickly not giving the chicken and cheese mixture time to melt. Mine browned too quickly so after I set them on a paper towel I transferred them to a cookie sheet in a warm oven. This actually worked out well for me it allowed me to finish other dishes I was working on and gave the cheese more time to heat up and melt. The tortilla remained crispy and delicious! Also I made too much but the leftovers were easily reheated in my toaster oven. I will never be able to have taco night again without making this recipe too! I look forward to making it again soon! Thanks for posting it!",

I followed the instructions to the letter except for one variation. A previous reviewer recommended adding garlic and salt to the chicken to give it more flavor. My variation is not for the fat conscious cooks I melted a half cube of butter in a pan with about 4 finely chopped garlic cloves then tossed the mixture with the shredded chicken before adding to the cheese mixture. My wife and I agree that in our memory this is the best Chimi we have tasted.",
