Taste was super-great!\" I've found that when making falafel or black bean patties that it's much easier to patty 'em up in plastic wrap and freeze them for as long as needed until ready to prepare. They hold together much better and go easily from freezer to skillet. Oh and while I used all the ingredients and followed the directions I didn't use all that oil as it didn't seem necessary; they browned up nice and crispy just fine w/ just a light coating of EVOO in the pan. Ate mine w/ Sriaracha; TASTY!",

I believe a little less than 1 cup of bread crumbs would have been fine. I was thinking because they were homemade and from the main pic that they might be a little more mild tasting or lighter. The recipe came up when I searched for a recipe with beans. It looked pretty easy and I had the ingredients on hand but it took me a long time to make them between the blending mixing frying clean-up etc. I decided to cut the frying oil amount in half and quite honestly could have cut it back even further after making them. These are pan-fried but even half the oil covers them completely while cooking. If you like traditional falafels and fried foods though you may enjoy these.",
