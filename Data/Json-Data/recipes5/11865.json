I also used fat free plain greek yogurt in place of the half and half. I made this as a Halloween side dish to ghost mini meatloaves and called it maggot primavera. It worked well for this but i will continue to make this side dish year round! Happy Halloween and thanks for a great recipe.",

I had my doubts about the addition of the tomato sauce, but it works.  Not sure why the recipe has the red bell pepper saut\u00e9ing on its own for 10 minutes (I cooked for 5), since bell pepper cooks fairly quickly.  In the future, I\u2019ll cook it with the other veggies, but that\u2019s not a game changer here.  Don\u2019t omit either the half-and-half or parmesan, as they bring this all together.  This one\u2019s a keeper, for sure.  preez, thanks for sharing.",
