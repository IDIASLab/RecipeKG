I used granny smith apples green bell peppers yellow spanish onion olive oil and black beans that were preseasoned with cumin and chili. I didn't cut my apples up small enough which makes the salad a little awkward to eat I would recommend making everything a similar size. I used a decent amount of lemon juice as well. I think this helps keep the salad a little longer. Overall I will be making this salad again. It's very tasty.",
