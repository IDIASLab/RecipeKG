I have seen similar recipes without the ham. I LOVE the addition of the ham! My daughter actually called me from school this morning asking me to heat some up and bring it to her at lunchtime. Unfortunately for her, she didn't know there weren't any left-overs. She has NEVER called me before requesting I bring her left-overs:) I will definitely be making again soon.",

I reduced the amount of onion by half and it was plenty, maybe even still too much. I also snuck in some steamed cauliflower, minced small, and no one noticed it was there. You could probably replace a quarter or more of the potatoes with cooked cauliflower because the color and texture are the same as the potatoes. I would be careful of the salt in this dish. I salted pretty heavily for the potatoes and had too much because of the salty ham.  The amount of butter seemed high so I used about half in the potatoes and saved some aside to toss with crushed corn flakes and some more cheese to make a crumbly topping. I still felt like it was a little oily. I think I will leave the butter out next time and see if I miss it. \n\nMy family liked this pretty well and my picky 5 year old finished her plate, so that's good enough for me.\n\nUpdate:  Made this again with no butter and no added salt and neither were missed.  It was better this time because I actually remembered to thaw the potatoes before mixing.  It was much easier to mix and the potatoes cooked through this time with no crunch.  Will ALWAYS replace some potato with cooked and chopped cauliflower, what an easy way to sneak in veggies!",

My husband, who normally doesn't like casseroles, and hardly comments on recipes said, \"This is delicious!\" after the first bite. I had to take the casserole away so he wouldn't eat more than a second helping! The chicken soup and sour cream make for a delicious creamy sauce. The only changes I made were to omit the butter and the added salt -- the dish doesn't need it -- and used low fat cheese and low fat sour cream. This decreased the amount of fat and cholesterol. I'll be making this again! Thank you mambear for submitting.",
