I also used more hamburger meat and ranch style beans with jalapenos instead of plain pinto beans. We garnished with crushed corn chips and shredded cheddar. This was a big hit around here -- got eaten all up by my hubbie and his friends over watching football. This was also so easy and I need easy with my four month old demanding constant attention. Thanks so much this is a keeper!!!!",

I put in a can of beef broth and this made a huge pot! Glad we've got it for lunch now!",
