I am sure the author of the recipe meant well, but the advice about cooking at \"200 degrees for four or five hours\" does not work!!!

The marinade and sauce are delicious, but please do not cook it at 200 degrees; cook it at 325 degrees as the original idea states!!!!",

This dish was great but I used an achiote oil made by heating not boiling the achiote seeds in sunflower oil on the stove for ten minutes. This gives a great red colored oil and is easier to use than the paste. The rest of the recipe remained the same. This oil can also be used for the rice just put a teaspoon in with the water! I Will certainly make this again!",

It is perhaps a bit on the tart side and I may consider altering the lemon-orange juice ratio a bit the next time I make it. I used the slow cooker method and the meat was moist and tender. I thickened the roasting liquids (marinade) with a bit of cornstarch and water and this made a really delicious sauce to ladle on top of filled tortillas at the option of the diners. I will definately be making this again. It was a hit with my entire family including my kids!",

The use of so much lemon juice gave the gravy an overpowering and identifiable citric taste, while leaving out essential elements.  Further research on the recipe has led me to include allspice and cinnamon and some garlic.  I see this recipe as absolutely unauthentic and boring.",
