I did make some changes based on my families likes. Instead of carrots and celery (my kids wont eat it) I added  a small can of cut up mushrooms, garlic and mushroom diced tomatoes and a diced fresh tomatoe. I didn't have 10 hours so I cooked it on high for 4 hours then turned to low for 2-3 more hours. I left this and a bag of boil-in-bag rice with the sitter. When I arrived home that night there was NONE left. They said it was so good they couldn't stop eating it! When my husband arrived home he said that there was barley enough for him. I assume it was delicious (since I didn't even get any). I will definatly make this again and again.",
