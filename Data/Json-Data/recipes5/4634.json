I did make a couple of simple additions that I think played a major role in this turning out so outstanding; I sauteed about 1/2 cup of finely chopped onion and a couple cloves of minced garlic in the butter and THEN added the brussels sprouts.  I allowed the brussels sprouts to get almost charred on some spots before adding the cream, which ended up giving this dish a caramelized taste. This could not have turned out any better!

Often considered one of the most disliked of vegetables Sprouts are full of vitamins inexpensive when bought in season (late Autumn and Winter) and very easy to prepare. I like the way they look when served. Brussels Sprouts add an interesting texture along with a complimentary splash of vibrant green colour to the dinner plate. This would be a unique and attractive side dish to any holiday meal or any meal for that matter. The addition of heavy cream (aka whipping/35% cream) makes for the unexpected; A rich and balanced smooth just right sauce. I am always grateful when a recipe's directions are easy to understand and follow producing results exactly as promised. High marks for this one Pugged.",

The sweet cream mixed with the tart bleu and nutty flavor is just wonderful. Thanks for this recipe I will definitely use it again!",
