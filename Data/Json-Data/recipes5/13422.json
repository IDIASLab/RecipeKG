Brush or spoon on the sauce (dont triple it!) cause it needs to cook and brown - The sauce is not a dipper at all. \r\n3. You cook this in the griller in your stove not on a barbeque at all! Line your tray with foil and you should be able to spoon off the potatoes when ready and disgard the foil - no biggie!\r\n4. Everything else is to taste...garlic or no garlic, cheese if you like - you decide.\r\nI have had so much success at making these so I hope that helps.",

This is what i did: I used real Mayo (not Miracle Whip) and added alittle extra garlic (because we like it). The first night I followed the recipe and boiled the potatoes and I think after the baking, they were just alittle over-cooked - SO, on the second night, I microwaved them for ~10 minutes on high. They were PERFECT after the baking. When blending the ingredients together, I litely coated the potatoes before putting them into a roasting foil bag. I tried baking in the oven (375 degrees for 20 min.) and the second night, I put the foil bag right on the BBQ. Both methods worked great! Give this recipe a try. I think you will like it.

I partially microwaved the potatoes vs. boiling and added a chopped onion.  I used 1/2 tsp. of oregano, 1/2 tsp. of italian seasoning, a little parsley, and added a couple of tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the mayo mixture.  You can use light mayo as well to cut down on fat.  I covered the pan with foil and these were great on the grill - perfect with steak.",

BBQ's have a solid plate called a hot plate and/or maybe a grill as well, and we do not differentiate -  it's a bbq, we do not call it a grill, and the cook decides how the food will be cooked(depends on how many beers have been consumed before and during the cooking).

I followed the recipe (scaled up to feed a large group), except i subbed about 1/3 of the lite mayo with sour cream, and i added some smoked paprika.  i also sprinkled fresh parmesan cheese at the end of cooking, and i think the cheese really made the flavour come together.  you'll need a lot of salt, which is typical of potato dishes.  overall, a very nice dish and a good change from the usual potato salad or scalloped potatoes you usually see at a bbq.",
