I wanted to do a one dish recipe for dinner, so I added veggies - a layer of zucchini on the bottom, slices of onion and green pepper, and some chopped up cabbage, with the shrimp on top.  I made my own tomato paste with fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I also trippled all of the sauce ingredients (except for the oil), spread it on top of the shrimp, and topped with cilantro and lemon juice.  The tomato paste and shrimp flavor seeped down through the veggies as they cooked.  It was amazing - we loved the flavor of the sauce!!!",
