It's tough to find recipes that meet these criteria while satisfying my husband and two youngest children. I'm so glad I found this recipe! I started with crushed tomatoes as good fresh tomatoes are hard to come by this time of year. I omitted the red wine and corn starch but otherwise followed the recipe. I was concerned about making a tomato sauce without sugar; I've never done it any other way. However my fears were unfounded. I have never before tasted such a flavorful pasta sauce! I didn't have to puree the sauce due to the crushed tomatoes and my finicky kids all gobbled it up all of the chunky vegetable goodness. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti with sauteed zucchini for me and meatballs for the non-fasters. My son thought it tasted so good that he was worried that it wasn't allowed on the fast. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!",
