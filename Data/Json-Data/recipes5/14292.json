As it stands now, the recipe is very bland and one note.\n\nHowever, the spaghetti squash is fab.  This recipe inspires me to use spaghetti squash as a pasta sub in other dishes.

I cooked the onions by themselves in a tiny bit of olive oil to bring out the flavor the added to them to the cooked hamburger meat and seasoned with sea salt pepper and dried basil thyme and oregano. I then cooked the rest of the ingredients as suggested except I added a larger fresh tomato diced finely peeled plum tomatoes I crushed by hand and 5 garlic cloves finely diced. I added the herbs 1 at a time a couple minutes apart and then seasoned this with sea salt and pepper to taste. Once the sauce which tasted fantastic by the way by itself was added to the meat mixture it lost some of the flavor so I added some dried Italian seasoning (basil thyme and oregano) and that did the trick. My 17 year old son who hates mushrooms and spaghetti squash loved this. Definitely will cook this again.",
