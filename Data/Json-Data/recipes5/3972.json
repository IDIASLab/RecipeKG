Taking the best ideas from both, make this recipe but add 1 tablespoon of dried or fresh tarragon to the sauce.  Instead of fish stock, boil the lobsters in 2 cups white wine, 2 cups water, sliced onion, 1 carrot and 1 celery stalk. This is a dramatic dish that can be made ahead of time, popped in the oven for browning, sure to impress your guests!",

I don't eat crab or lobster, so I've been mssing out on the thermidor I've been cooking for my significant other.  Mind you, the sauce is good in my usual recipe, which is different from this one.  I sub. about 3/4 of the wine with brandy, simmering the sauce before this also helps thicken it some.  Definately a keeper, but one I'm going to 'fiddle with' before I'm sure I got the perfect, FOR US, recipe.  That's the secret, fiddle until you got it just how you like it, recipes ain't written in stone, they're meant to be 'adjusted'.  Anyway, nice recipe, thanks!",

A suggestion: place a small amount of lobster meat in the shell and place the rest in the pan with the broth...it will all cook and you'll still have the decoration",

Wish I made more going to use the leftovers on some imitation crab and add to pasta. This would make a great sauce for a lobster pasta too I almost made it that way wish I did. Would have stretched the meat and filled me up just wanted more after I ate it. Also served with lemon on the side to taste instead of mixing it in might save some headaches that way.",
