Savory sweet potatoes, glad that I found you!\" Super easy recipe and delicious; I left mine in longer, stirring frequently enough that the sweet potatoes browned evenly, but my onions were a little burnt and shrivel-y, which is my bad b/c I didn't cut them into wedges, as directed. I did follow the recipe, other than apparently being a little too dainty w/ my onion cuts. Wow, these were terrific, and how nice that they weren't bathed in brown sugar or some other sticky sweetness. I squashed some of the leftovers (sans onions) for the baby, and she said \"gurgle blurgle /smile\" as she devoured hers too.",
