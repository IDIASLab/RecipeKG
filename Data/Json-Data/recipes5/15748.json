Instead of making appetizers out of this recipe I actually made this into lunch wraps for my family by adding leaf lettuce and sliced tomatoes layered over the spread mixture. Everyone loved these even my husband called me from work and asked me to make this again tomorrow. GREAT change from your everyday lunch plus it was cheap to make and counted as a meatless meal!",

I used black bean refried beans mixed with taco seasoning and a little salsa added some shredded cheddar on top of the beans and the cream cheese guacamole mixture on top of that. Yummy! Oh yes the cream cheese guacamole mixture is a genius idea tastes great and keeps the guacamole from turning that unappealing brown color..",
