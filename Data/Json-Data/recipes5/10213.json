Here I've come up with a much quicker, more casual assembly method that works whether you boil, steam, or fry them. Served in a vinegary broth, however, they mimic the experience of soup dumplings, which are typically served with vinegar to balance that gush of rich, meaty juices you get when you bite in.",

Being Chinese and having made them the traditional way with the pleats to seal them all my life, it's refreshing to find an easier way of doing it. Side benefit is that it reduces the amount of dough in each dumpling.  Also, I find that instead of 'karate chop' to seperate the dumplings, I use a fat chop-stick instead. This helps to seal each dumpling on the sides, before I use a pizza cutter to cut them apart. Definitely making more in the future, and sharing this with friends & family!",

We definitely will make these again!",
