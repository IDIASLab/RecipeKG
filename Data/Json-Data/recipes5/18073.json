I actually use frozen meatballs but I prepare the sauce as written (except I have usually left out the vodka) and then throw everything in a crock pot. It is sooooo good! I use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce - our personal fave - amazing! I've also had good luck with KC's. YUM! I can only imagine how much better this is with the homemade meatballs! Someday I will try! I've also thrown Little Smokies/Mini Hot Dogs in the sauce. Sometimes I will just let the sauce cook first in the crock pot and add the meatballs after awhile. They usually heat up pretty well and this keeps 'em from getting soggy. THANKS for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "At first I didn't think this recipe was that good. Though I think part of my impression was because of the bad choice in trying to pair it with cooked linguine. I intentionally made the full yield in order to have left overs. I didn't have an issue with them not cooking through enough. As the sauce was simmering I used a large skillet and browned the meatballs in small batches before adding them to the pot with the sauce. They cooked through while the sauce simmered for about an hour. Reheating them and serving them alone I realize that they are quite tasty. I agree with one of the other reviewers that these would make great meatball subs. Though I didn't initially like them my family did. And I've since served some of the left over meatballs and gotten many compliments. These do take a while to make but they are worth it. Something that might help cut down on prep time is to have a few volunteers with you to form the meatballs. This might go without saying though I've learned the hard way that you need to be careful when you are simmering the sauce so that it doesn't become burnt on the bottom of the pot. A splatter screen is a good idea too. Thanks Liane!",

I made the meatballs and sauce the night before then cooked them in the crock pot on low for about 2.5 hours at work the next morning. They turned out fabulous!
