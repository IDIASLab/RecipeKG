Three just seemed like a lot and would have been mostly onion if I didn't cut it down.  We enjoyed the \"sweet\" flavor that browning the onions gave it.  The brown sugar was just right. Served over egg noodles and was even better the next day.  Thanks for a great way to use leftover pork!",

I like others didn't have tomato sauce so I used spaghetti sauce instead and added garlic (I rarely cook without it!). Other than that I followed it to the tee. For those who have tried it and didn't like it or felt it \"was bland\" try it again. This time don't use a non-stick pan for browning the meat and onions. You don't get the roux you need to give it flavor. I have every intention on trying this again with leftover beef and chicken. There's no reason that this won't work with any meat! Absolutely loved it! Thanks!!!",
