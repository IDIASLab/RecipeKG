I really tried to stick to the ingredients so I could judge it fairly. I made half a recipe with leftover Easter turkey breast and in place of the regular salt I used both seasoned salt and garlic salt. I did use a whole green onion so that was more than a tsp. but the more onion the better in our opinion! Do Not leave out the pecans they add a wonderful texture and flavor! My hubby couldn't believe he liked them in this casserole since he never likes them in cold turkey or chicken salad! I also used reduced fat cheese and low fat mayo and we totally couldn't taste a difference in the finished product. Yummy!! I will always use this recipe after holidays and probably look forward to the leftoves more than the holiday meal!",

I made the following adjustments based on the ingredients I had: I used chopped fresh red pepper instead of celery and I added about 1/2 cup of garbanzo beans because I needed to use them up. I used seasoned salt not regular salt. Also instead of crushed potato chips I used crushed white tortilla chips. I'm guessing the original recipe is tasty based on everyone's reviews but what I ended up making was scrumptious and I will definitely make it again!!",
