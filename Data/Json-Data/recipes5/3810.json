Subbed tequila (sorry) for the sake cuz I didn't have any, and used red wine vinegar instead of the rice vinegar.  Reduced the spices because of my husband, just a dash of 5-spice pdr and 1/4 tsp powdered ginger. Skimmed the fat off the sauce and served it with rice and salad.  Next time, will make coconut rice and bok choy salad to go with it.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!\r\n",

I didn't have sake so I used white wine and 1 tsp. of powdered ginger. I boiled the ribs for about 20 minutes first then marinated them in some of the marinade all day then put them on the grill basting them a bit. I then finished them in the slow cooker with the rest of the sauce for a couple of hours to get them nice and tender. If you want that deep red color add a couple drops of red food coloring to the marinade. This stuff is awesome!",

I did follow this one, with two tiny additions -- I added a small amount of sesame oil because I like the flavour, and a few drops of hickory liquid smoke.  I used baby back ribs, marinated them for about 4 hours, and cooked them about twice as long as called for.  This turned out fantastically!  The flavour was EXACTLY what I was looking for.  I served it to raves from picky eaters.  Next time, I'll probably make this the day ahead, and marinate overnight to really soak the marinade into the ribs.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!",
