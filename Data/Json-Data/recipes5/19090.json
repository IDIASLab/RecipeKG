The lady at the liquor store suggested that I should also try to marinate veggies in this. But a word of caution from her \"only marinate for about 15 - 20 minutes!\"",

What I do is make up a batch of this marinade and place each steak in a freezer bag with this marinade then pop in the freezer. When ready to have one just take it out of the freezer and thaw. Something about thawing out the meat while in the marinade really pulls it into the meat. I do this with any of the steak marinades that I use. This way I can have a great steak anytime!",
