Drain any excess liquid in the squash before removing the flesh. Green bell is OK half and half is not. We thought it was too sweet the first time so I removed the nutmeg and added 1 tsp. cayenne pepper 1 tsp. ginger and 1/2 tsp. cumin. Also 1 cup basil seemed alot so I used 2 Tbs. dried basil. I was surprised to find the crawfish at Walmart but I did add shrimp to the first batch. It's a lot of work but I would make it again.",
