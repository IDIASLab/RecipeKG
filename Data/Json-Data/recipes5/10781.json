My Scottish boyfriend was impressed and was especially amazed that I managed to cook everything through and still have runny centers. This was my first time making (and eating!) scotch eggs. I will make these again for sure. The soft boiled eggs will generally peel better the colder they are. I added ice cubes to my cold water to help them get to room temperature fast. When peeling the eggs just be gentle- a light hand is good. The colder they are the less likely they will come apart and even if they do as long as the middle dosent burst the egg can still be used. I even find peeling them submerged in the cold water a bit easier than on the counter.",
