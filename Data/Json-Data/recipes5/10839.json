When I first read the recipe, I thought that 1 cup of asparagus would not be enough, but it is.  Sure, you could add more, but 1 cup is fine.  Be sure to slice it thinly!  As Chef John says in the video, just about anything would work here.  I can see broccoli, diced or crumbled sausage, diced ham......just about anything.  With two of us who were quite hungry, there were a couple of slices left over.  According to hubby, it was great the next day cold!  Don't miss this one.  It's really, really good and very easy.",
