But the basic recipe is incredible!  I've taken it to 3 parties so far and it always gets gobbled up first and gets rave reviews!  Thanks for my new favorite recipe!--Kim Johnston",

I substituted orange juice for lemon (its all I had) added a little bit of cinnamon to the crumble and did not put more sugar in the cranberry sauce I also added an egg to the cream cheese filling (this helped it to set and give a richer flavor). To make this a 4-5 star for me and my family I'd double the cream cheese filling. My dh and I agreed there were enough cranberries but there was too much crust and not enough cream cheese filling.",
