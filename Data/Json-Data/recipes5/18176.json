And I didn't have any honey mustard dressing so I used raspberry poppy seed vinaigrette which was perfect. I had red grapes strawberries and raspberries for the salad. Yum and perfect for summer.",

My pecans came out very \"goopy\" and I baked them twice as long as recipe calls for just to try and get them to crisp up. Maybe cutting butter in half will help? Also if I refrigerated they were less goopy but stuck together and I had to hammer them apart and if I didn't refrigerate they got all sloopy and gooey again and looked very unpleasant. Anyways do they need to be refrigerated to be safe to eat? Somehow I didn't feel comfortable leaving them out. I will keep this recipe but perhaps look for a different recipe for the \"candied\" pecans.",
