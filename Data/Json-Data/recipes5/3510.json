Hummus is my Spring 2007 perfection recipe (I keep making it until I get the perfect one- and then take it to all the parties and and bask in the compliments).  I was thrilled to find a hummus recipe that added jalapenos (texas, in search of the perfect hummus....).  I love this recipe.  I did add more jalapenos and more lemon juice, double what the recipe called for, but that was due to our regional preferences.  \n\nBig Tip: Make it ahead of time and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  That's the secret that makes this recipe go from good to great.  \n\nThank you Andrew for posting this recipe.  You just proved that any recipe can be made even better by \"spicing it up\" with the right ingredient.",

Totally outshines all my friends hummus that they have been making for years.  We will never buy hummus again.  \nUPDATE: We've beek making this for a while now.  First, you have to add tahini, it's not really hummus without it.  Second, if its too thick, add some of the bean water from the garbanzos.  Third, I still like it better without the curry and don't be stingy with the cumin!  Fourth, I usually make this in batches of 6.  You should too.  It keeps for a while and it's just to die for.  Make it for a party, put out half of it, if that goes put out more, and if you have some left at the end, use it for sandwiches or eat it as a snack with carrot sticks. Fifth, fresh jalapenos are awesome in this.  ",

I had a hard time not eating all myself just now. I decorated it with crushed pepper flakes and sliced jalapenos on top! Looks great wonderful creamy consistency and amazing taste!
