I made it exactly as stated in the recipe, with one small change- instead of 8 oz of heavy whipping cream, I only used about 4 oz, and then I added about 3 oz of sour cream that I had left over from another recipe. Some reviews have said that the sauce is very runny, but mine wasn't at all. Be sure to cook the mushrooms long enough for the liquid to evaporate and they start to brown- not only does that reduce the amount of liquid, it gives the mushrooms a great flavor. Also be sure to let the sauce reduce a bit after adding the sherry, and again after adding the cream. It'll thicken up nicely if you give it the time it needs! So good.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this exactly to the recipe the first time.  Quite good as Chef John's recipes usually are.  I thought it could be better as I was looking for something to serve to my foodie friends at our quarterly wine pairing dinner.  So, my tweaks were: 1. I used about 1 1/4 lb gourmet mushrooms and Shiitakes rather than the white mushrooms. I'd like to try it with Chanterelles and Morels the next time they are in season.  2.Cook the mushrooms in a stainless steel skillet.  After the liquid boils away, keep cooking and stirring. The mushrooms will start to stick to the bottom of the skillet. Keep cooking until the bottom of the skillet has a good coating of browned mushroom bits. This technique seems to get way more mushroom flavor in the sauce than browning the mushrooms in a non-stick skillet.  3. I de-glazed with 1/2 cup dry white wine instead of the 2 ounces of sherry.  This releases all of those tasty browned bits for the sauce.  4. I increased the amount of fresh herbs from 1.5 tsp each to nearly 1 Tbsp each.  Basically, twice what the recipe called for.  I also put a bit more Parmesan in the sauce. 5. I made my own Fettuccine noodles.  Other than that, I followed the same recipe and the results were significantly more flavorful.  VERY good.  I paired this dish with a Northern California Pinot Noir and it was a big hit with my friends.  One other tip:  Don't skip the chance to adjust the seasoning after the cream.  The salt balance is really important to get the best flavor.",

This dish is incredible. I used the recipe exactly as is using fresh  herbs (maybe extra garlic). I used excellent quality stock and premium parmigiano. It was not bland at all. If you use dried herbs, cheap stock, cheap parmigiano and omit the sherry, what do you expect other than bland? Only other alteration was I couldn't get Shitake so I used some dried porcini which I re-hydrated and poured the juice in. I am not normally a tarragon fan. This was just sensational. I cook a lot. I rarely say this. Thanks Chef John!!!",

I used minced garlic, a big heap of it. I only had dried herbs, not fresh, so I added them in the cream and cooked them, rather than adding at the end. No sherry, but my husband had some Chardonnay, so I used that. And when it came to the Parmesan, well, we are cheese freaks, so I used more than the recipe calls for.  I will make this a common dish in this house. Next time I will be adding artichokes, my husband requested it. It is a very runny sauce, so next time I may try what another reviewer suggested and use sour cream rather than whipping cream.  If you find it is bland, try upping all the herbs and garlic and cheese. I love it as is, but for some people this is probably a great base  to build on.",
