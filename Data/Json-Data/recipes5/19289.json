Having read lots of Sticky Pudding recipes I desired a thicker sauce. I cooked the sauce to more of a caramel. Removed the puddings from the pan placed a small amount of sauce in the individual dishes placed the puddings and poured the sauce over them and let them sit. They were placed back into the oven prior to serving to warm them and the sauce. Exactly how they are \"done\" over here. Next time I will serve them with a traditional custard as well. Thank you for sharing an easy and great recipe.",

Definitely 5 stars for taste but 3 stars for the process and amount of dishes you get dirty. As others have stated this would be great for dinner parties since it makes 12 individual servings but if you have some leftover like me refrigerate the puddings with some sauce on top of each one since it thickens as it cools. Microwave an individual portion and it's just as good as straight from the oven. I served mine with vanilla ice cream. Very very good but will make only once in a while since each pudding is over 500 calories.",

I don't think I would only make half of the sauce as one reviewer suggested. All of the sauce will be used up. I invited my critical neighbour over to try it and his face lit up with joy when he took the first bite! I'm pretty sure eating this put him in a better mood. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and light margarine instead of butter in the sauce. The taste was great but I'm sure the thicker sauce that would have resulted from using the heavy cream would have been amazing. I will definitely be making this again!",

I did make a few changes cut the sugar down (out of 375g - 200g) 1/3 of the flour I used wholemeal flour used self raising instead of adding baking powder 1/3 of the liquid added to the pot with the dates was orange juice got that from other recipies used margarine instead of butter cause thats what I had can't tell the difference Note: I found the mixture after cooking was too thick to be blended successfully but was already so mushy the blending wasn't really needed. In the future I would: completely use only wholemeal flour for a more gritty earthy taste? Maybe add some nuts. Will make again.",
