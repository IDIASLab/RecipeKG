But that s where my interest ended as the rest of the recipe seemed very basic. So by the time I got done embellishing this recipe to my liking I guess the only resemblance it had to the original recipe was for the most part the barbecue sauce and herb-seasoned croutons. So I used a ground beef veal and pork mix 2 pounds total so I scaled this recipe to 6 servings. I processed the croutons into fine crumbs. I didn t want an overpowering taste of barbecue sauce so I reduced it by a third to 1/2 cup (again for the recipe scaled to 6 servings for 2 pounds of meat). I made up the difference with the milk (I used half-and-half increasing it to 1/2 cup). I wanted some contrast in texture so I added 1/2 c. each of chopped celery and green pepper and 1 c. of chopped onion. It isn t meatloaf without these ingredients if you ask me. I more than tripled the garlic to a full tablespoon and added 2 tsp. of Montreal Steak Seasoning. I skipped the glaze altogether. Meatloaf and sugar don t work for me. No regrets on that either. What started out as maybe a three star recipe turned out to be a 5-star recipe after I admit fairly significant changes.",

The only substitution I made was I ommited the brown sugar and bbq sauce Because I am not a big fan of sweet tasting meats. I substituted 1/2 cup ketchup which I put in the meatloaf mix. About 20 minutes before I took it out of the oven I spread more ketchup over the top and then let it cook. The loaf as juicy seasoned just right and my husband didn't run for the hills and my dogs aren't trying too call the humane society to rescue them frothe horror of mommy's meatloaf. Thankyou for contributing this recipe.",
