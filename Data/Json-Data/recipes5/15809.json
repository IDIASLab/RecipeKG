But to accommodate my personal taste, I changed the flour tortillas to corn tortillas.  This was much better as the tortillas soaked up so of the liquid.  I used the smaller tortillas so I made it in a 9 x 13 baking dish which worked just fine.  We had guacamole and chopped black olives on the side, and this made the dish absolutely perfect.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe took some time to get together but it was very good. The only problem I had was with the black bean mixture. Once I added the enchilada sauce to the black beans it was a very thin soupy mixture. I had to add another full can of black beans to thicken it and then I had a ton left over. I would just add enough enchilada sauce to the beans to be a good spreadable consistency. Next time I will also make my own enchilada sauce because I would like the flavor better than the canned sauce. One suggestion is to wrap the bottom of your spring form pan in foil. That way if you have any leakage it won't get all over your oven. Also - when you warm tortillas they shrink so you may need to do a couple of tortillas per layer in order to fill your pan. Thanks for the recipe!",

Now if it doesn't look gloopy enough, add more enchilada sauce.  Taste it before you start layering.  Is it spicy enough, not enough sauce?  Adjust as you want to.  Add more heat or not.  4)  Forget the springform pan.  Don't fry the tortillas.  Just take a casserole dish of your choice, grease it up.  Layer a bit of the meat/bean/cheese mixture on the bottom, put a layer of tortillas on top, a bit more cheese, then repeat layers as you'd like.  Bake until it's all bubbly.  Now that wasn't hard, was it?",

I added just enough enchilada sauce to the beans to make it a spreadable mixture and omitted adding the 1/4 cup enchilada sauce at each layer because it seemed far too moist otherwise. After the top tortilla I added a layer of cheese then covered with enchilada sauce then sprinkled with more cheese. This gave a beautiful marbled top to the dish. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I also had to use McCormick dry taco/enchilada mixes. (The canned sauce is not gluten free and I wanted to stay simple first run at making this). For the sauce I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce with a little less water and refried beans (about half a large can) but saved some sauce to put on the top without the beans to keep it a little thicker inside. I also did not have a spring form pan I used a glass 9x11 pan and very lightly greased it just enough to keep it from sticking. I will make this again I hope to make it without the dry mixes and use my own sauce mix. We always use cheddar and jack with our cheesy meals so I also added that. Really a great one dish meal take a little prep but worth it!",
