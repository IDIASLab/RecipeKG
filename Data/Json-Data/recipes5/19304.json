I made this seasoning exactly as the recipe directed but poured the oil and seasoning over my chicken and into a ziplock and let it do it's thing all day while I was at work.  I love that I can whip this up with seasonings that I have in the cupboard too. **UPDATE**  Just 3 days later I tried it out on pork tenderloins.  2 one pound tenderloins in a ziplock, seasoning mix as recipe calls for and probably closer to 1/2 cup veggie oil. Marinated 4 hours. Baked at 425 for 25 minutes.  It made a gorgeous spicy, salty, and a little bit sweet crust on the tenderloins. Loved it even more than with the chicken.  I will decrease the salt to 2 tsp and increase the cayenne to 1/2 tsp next time as I think it might be a bit on the salty side and I'd like a little more heat .  Next time I'm going to try it on boneless chicken breasts.",

Served with cheddar mashed potatoes and canned southwestern corn. Beautiful on the plate! I didn't have dried garlic, so I put fresh minced garlic in the bottom of the pan with the oil. I can't think of any way this recipe could be improved.",

I didn't \"marinate it\" because I didn't have time, but I can't imagine it made much of a difference since it's basically a dry rub.  I baked it at 350 convection (equals 375 in a regular oven) for exactly one hour and it was perfect.  Crispy, papery skin and perfect on the inside.  Yum!",
