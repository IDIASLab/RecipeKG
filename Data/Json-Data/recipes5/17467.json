The cookie is a pecan sandy type texture. The fondant eggs are actually very good - they taste like frosting - and add sweetness and temper the dryness of the cookie. I had been very tempted to use jelly beans or other egg shaped candies for the eggs and I'm very glad I didn't! The fondant eggs were easy to make and were a perfect compliment to the cookie.",

I greased the cookie sheet but there's a lot of butter in the dough so it may not be necessary. The recipe says to make the dough balls 1 teaspoon size but I recommend at least a tablespoon of dough per nest. The dough and fondant were easy to work with so I suppose you could make the nests and eggs any size you like. They taste like a shortbread cookie rolled in walnuts and the almond flavored fondant eggs are a perfect flavor match. I made three tiny eggs per nest by rolling little pieces of fondant in a ball. I'll definitely make this recipe again!",

                "reviewBody": "Wow! Every cookie platter should have at least one beautiful colorful cookie and this is it! The \"nest\" is a wonderful buttery crunchy shortbread-type cookie not overly sweet. The eggs are the perfect counterpart; sweet little almond flavored morsels that melt in your mouth. I made the mistake of flattening my nests too much because I wanted to have enough room for 3 eggs in each nest. They flattened and spread a little more while baking so it would have been better to just make a ball with a thumbprint-sized depression like the recipe says. The eggs are easy to make kind of like playing with clay but do take time. Because they are sweet it is better to make them small and they will fit into the nests better that way too. I baked the cookies first then made the eggs while watching tv. Very easy and fun too. These will definitely be a staple on my Christmas Easter etc. cookie platters. It is not always easy to find something that both looks pretty and tastes good but these fit the bill. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!",
