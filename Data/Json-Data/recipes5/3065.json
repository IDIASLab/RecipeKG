One thing that i must let everyone know is that when your making the custard you can not! stop stirring or it will scorch! continuously stir this please or it wont turn out! dont bake ouyr crust and put your custard on when its still warm because if you let it cool it will thicken too much and it wont spread well. But other than that it was great and i've made it 3 times!",

Next time I will use vanilla pudding or a different custard recipe instead. I used a walnut crust from this site instead of graham cracker (personal preference). It complemented the dessert very well. I used pineapples in their own juice (all I had) but it would be better in heavy syrup. It was just a tad too tangy in their own juice. I did not let that bear on my rating since the recipe called for heavy syrup.",
