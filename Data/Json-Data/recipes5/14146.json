This is the closest thing I have ever found to Bennie's green chili in Denver CO.  (I omit the cilantro and lime, but I'm sure it would be good)",

I cut the pork into cubes and used it in this recipe. The only other changes I made: I used a 10oz can of green enchilada sauce and I used beef broth instead of water at the end. I also used 1 tsp of all the spices instead of the varied amounts the recipe calls for (I tend to eyeball my spices and I like everything HOT so it worked to use more of the peppery spices). In the end I got a beautiful chunky stew. DELISH!:)",
