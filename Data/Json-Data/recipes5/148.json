Make sure you use pearl barley because hulled barley will be chewy, and quick barley will be mushy.  There's also not much barley in here, so I'd probably double it next time. I also suggest seasoning the meat with salt and pepper, and again seasoning the soup once it's done, to taste. I found that it needed additional salt to really bring out the flavors.",
