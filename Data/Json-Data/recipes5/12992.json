Canned chicken creeps me out too (as one other reviewer stated), so I used 3 real chicken breasts.  While boiling the breasts, I sauteed the onions and peppers for about 5 minutes prior to adding them to 2 cans Mex stewed tomatoes (which I had chopped), 2 can of chili beans, and a half jar of jalapenos (which I had chopped).  After the chicken was cooked through, I melted about 1 T of butter and sauteed 2 cloves of garlic, then added the shredded/cubed chicken and seasoned it with about 2 T of Frank's Red Hot.  I then added it to the pot along with 1T of cumin and 1T of chili powder.  Then added 1 can of chicken broth and 1 can of water.  About 20 minutes into simmering, I noted the soupiness, so I mixed about 3T of cornstarch and 3-4 T of water together, and then added it to the pot and mixed well.\n\nIt turned out amazing... thick, healthy, delicious, and just the right amount of spiciness not to interfere with the flavor.\n\nI also served it over a slice of wheat bread w/ a piece of fat free cheese on top... outstanding :)",

I used real cubed chicken breast(something about meat from a can doesn't sound appealing) and halved the recipe. I used 2 1/2 cans of Rotel tomatoes instead of the stewed(too slimey). I used black beans instead of chili beans a whole can of sliced jalapenos 1 tablespoon of chili powder and 1 tablespoon of cumin and the can of chicken broth. I only needed to add about 1/2 cup of water after it had been cooking a while. Although this dish was too spicy for the rest of my family to eat I really enjoyed it! Thanks!",
