The only changes I made were: had no fresh ginger so added a few dashes of ground and had no green bell pepper so used a yellow one instead. Adding beef bouillon to the meatballs was tasty; I had never tried that before and they were awesome. The sauce was great too; thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE: Made this again using fresh ginger...much tastier! Although this time I was short on time and used Simek's mini beef meatballs not as good. I prefer using pineapple tidbits other than that this recipe needs no tweaks!",

The sauce was just right (not too thick not too thin). I used ground ginger because I didn't have fresh ginger on hand (just eyeball it). The meatballs are EXCELLENT served over egg noodles (I prefer noodles instead of rice). Serve with a tossed salad and cold applesauce on the side. These meatballs are very versatile and can be served with a variety of sauces (i.e. Bar-B-Q sauce or brown gravy - just omit the pepper and pineapple!) to change things up a bit. This recipe is a winner for sure. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!",

For the meatballs I used 1.2 lbs ground turkey and only added 1/3 cup bread crumbs and added a dash of soy sauce and minced garlic. I then cooked the meatballs about 3/4 of the way through in a little bit of canola oil before I added the sauce. I made the sauce exactly how it said minus adding the pineapple chunks at the end. It was absolutely delicious!! I served it over rice! You could add additional veggies to make it a meal--onions water chestnuts pea pods etc. Overall--DELICIOUS!",
