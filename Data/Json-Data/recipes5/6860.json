I think after I prep everything next time I will make the Hollandaise and sausage first that way I can focus on poaching the eggs and then the assembly of the dish. That said the sauce was a little thin for me next time around I will have some more cheese ready to thicken it up as well. We really enjoyed the combination of flavors thank you!",
