So try and use a 9x11. And I put semi-sweet chocolate chips and butterscotch chips in them. The butterscotch were lousy (they were too sweet) but the semi-sweet chips were nice. I imagine peanut butter chips would be nice in this. You don't need icing with this brownie because it's just perfect on it's own. Not too sweet and very chocolatey. Huzzah! I'll make this one again.",

It was easy to make and turned out wonderful! I ended making them in a 9x13 pan because I don't have a 9x11 and I thought a 9x9 would be too thick. They turned out fairly thin but still moist chewy and very chocolaty! My husband loved them too and he's a hard critic when it comes to desserts. These actually remind me of a mix between fudge and a brownie both so good!! I will be making these again. Thanks for the great recipe.",
