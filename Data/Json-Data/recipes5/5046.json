There are many versions of this dessert. For the cake...pound cake angle food cake bakery biscuits (my favorite)...the strawberries can be bought frozen and sweetened which I think are better than the apple-hard strawberries in the produce department. Lite frozen topping is great. Of course you can make a healthier version at home but it will take a little more work.",
