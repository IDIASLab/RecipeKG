There were many basic cookies and alot of chocolate ones so these really stood out and looked very festive. Although they were a lot of work everyone complimented me and said how they were worth all the work that went into them (of course they weren't the ones making them - lol). And I made 6 batches of them! Next time I'll probably make some prior to the get-together to have for home and make less to exchange. After all if I'm going to that much effort I want some for myself. Thanks for the recipe!",

TIP: You don't have to sift your powdered sugar here. I measured out what was needed and just ran my big wisk through the sugar. Works like a charm.",

I added a beaten egg to the dough and it made all the difference in the world.  The dough was then easy to roll.   It did require additional baking time (2-3 minutes) but the results were tremendous.  The cookies cake out looking just like the ones in the picture.    I also highly recommend soaking the cherries in a good rum for a few days.  These where the hit of the holidays.  The last thing I did with these cookies was dip the tops in dark chocolate.  You need a dark chocolate because milk chocolate is just a little too sweet.",
