I did use organic garbanzo beans(they just taste better) and stirred in about a 1/4 c. or so of greek yogurt. I liked this as did my older son. My husband was indifferent. My youngest wouldn't touch it. I think I might keep the basic ingredients of this recipe and perhaps mix this salad with some of 5thsister's greek yogurt dip. NOTE: I cannot stress enough to use fresh spices when you can and organic produce. It does make all the difference.",

In fact I'd probably just omit the cheese since it doesn't add much to the overall flavor.",
