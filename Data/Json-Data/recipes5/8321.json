        "description": "My son and daughter, both professional chefs, love the taste of fennel. They always insist that I make my fennel seed and orange peel bread when they come to visit. A bread machine will make the kneading easier, but it is not necessary. I have never used the bread machine to mix this one, as it is big enough for two loaves, and thus won't fit in my small bread maker. Hand touched is always nicer anyway. The loaves can also be braided for a nice touch.",
