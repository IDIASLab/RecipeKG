The shredded meat remained tough after 7 hours on high so I cooked it another 1-1/2 hours. IMO the tomato flavor really dominates the sauce almost overpowering the flavor of the beef. I think some fresh chopped garlic and maybe even a little soy sauce would add some tang to this. Served on AR's Hamburger Buns along with cole slaw and baked beans. Overall a solid crock pot recipe.",

About 3/4 way through the cooking time I took the steak out to chop it and almost threw it out the sauce looked so watery and lacked flavor. but i went ahead and chopped the meat up and let it cook another hour and a half. so glad i did because it ended up being delicious. DH loved it. Only thing I did different was double the tomato paste because i had a can and didn't want to waste it. also added an extra tablespoon of sugar to balance out the extra paste. Would have rather had it over noodles or rice instead of sandwiches but that's personal preference and i will make it that way next time. thanks for sharing.",

While the sauce base was fairly good it was too tomato-y so I tweaked it based on my sloppy joe sauce recipe. I started with half of the recipe as there are just 2 of us. So I halved the sauce ingredients and then added and additional 1-1/2 T cider vinegar 1 T brown sugar 1/2 T. worcestershire 1 T yellow mustard 1 T soy sauce 1/4 C ketchup and liquid smoke to taste. I cooked on high for 4 hours. The meat was very tender and shredded beautifully! I added it back to the crockpot and cooked on low another hour. It was melt in your mouth excellent! I will make again with my additions...it made for a great BBQ sammy!",

Slightly reduced the sugar to 3 TBPS and upped the Cider Vinegar to 1/4 cup for both health and personal tastes. When I added the contents to my slow cooker I was a little worried that the meat was going to dry out so I put in half a can (6 oz) of light beer. Also definitely shred at least an hour before serving and leaving it in the cooker for 5 hours surely helped!",
