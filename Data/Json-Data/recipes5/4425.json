I blended about half the bean mixture to give it a creamier texture like the picture. I thought it tasted a little bland so added a tsp of paprika and 2 tbs of chili powder. It was great loaded into a flour tortilla to serve as a wrap. Next time I think I would serve this with tomato and cucumber slices along with some feta crumbles for a complete meal. Also might add a pinch of cayenne for a kick.",
