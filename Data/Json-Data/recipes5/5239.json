Don't skip the blender step - adding the puree back to the pot with the remaining lentils and bulgur creates a to-die-for combination texture that's both al dente and creamy smooth. Great for a casual home cooked meal but good enough to serve to guests! It's even a hit with kids and people sensitive to spicy foods - just be sure to leave out the cayenne.",
