Mine worked perfectly with EASY tweaks as follows.\n\n1) I CHILLED the oil first in the fridge for a couple of hours.\n\n2) First I used a mortar and pestle to grind together garlic and salt into a paste. (Keep salt to a minimum). This step is optional but worked well.\n\n3) I added the garlic mixture and eggs to food processor and blended until just combined.\n\n4) Turned the processor on and added the oil, scraping the container regularly during the blending.\n\nI used a food processor for the whole thing and it came together very quickly. About 10 minutes for entire process, and it's really the texture of mayonnaise. I added the lemon juice at the end of blending and it smoothed it out to a lovely consistency and gave it a nice little acidity. Highly recommend.",
