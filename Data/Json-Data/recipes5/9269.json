For the crust are used Oreos and crumbled them up and I did not add the extra sugar in the crust part. The result was perfect there was enough sugar in the cookies. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly just using plain sugar. The orange zest was a nice touch and delivered the tang that this recipe called for. I found tips on how to remove from the pan. It is important to refrigerate after to set it up. To remove from the bottom of the pan just warm it slightly over a warm stove burner and it will slide onto your plate.",
