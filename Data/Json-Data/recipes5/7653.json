I used a chicken sausage from COSTCO that I already had (and to cut the fat) and since I didn t have a jalape\u00f1o so I used a whole large poblano pepper diced. I also thought it needed some more green color because we try to get dark green veggies in our meals so I added a couple large handfuls of fresh spinach leaves right before adding the shrimp. Lastly I didn t have jasmine rice so I used long grain brown rice instead and cooked it a little longer (maybe 5 extra minutes). The lemon juice at the end (I used juice from a whole lemon) gave it this nice tangy flavor (don t skip that)... the whole family RAVED! Definitely making this again! THANKS for sharing it!",
