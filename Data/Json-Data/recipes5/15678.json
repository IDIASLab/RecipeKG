That being said this was the perfect recipe to sub in what I did have and I'd love to actually try the real thing lol. I used cubed up chicken instead of turkey. I only had a small can of pumpkin and like 5 tortillas. Black beans instead of refried. I decided to make this into a casserole instead. I shredded the tortillas on the bottom added the meat mixture then a layer of the tomato mixture then a layer of cheese. I did it all again except I used the last of a bag of black bean tortilla chips in place of tortillas. It came out sooooo delicious. I learned recently from a cookbook to take my can of chipotle peppers and blend it all up really well. Then save it in a container in the fridge. You can take it out a Tbs or tsp at a time. I used a Tbs and it was nice and smoky with a little heat. Use more for more heat. Can't wait to try this as enchiladas",
