I know the creator of this recipe and she just lightly peels the cucumber and uses the whole thing. She uses more cucumber for a dressing and less for a dip. When I make it I use a heaping tablespoon or two of garlic powder instead of fresh garlic because I like that taste better. I love it because I actually enjoy eating raw vegees when I have this to dip them into!!!! I crave it now and have to have some in the fridge all the time.",

I love avocados so this seemed like a perfect dressing for me. Absolutely LOVE IT and agree is a nice dip as well. I did add 2 additional garlic cloves because I like the added bite. From a time preparation perspective you really don't need to cube the avocados if they are ripe they blend up with no issues. Would highly recommend this recipe to others.",
