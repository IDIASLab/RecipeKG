The whiting was a bit fishy tasting and the combo of fishy + milky didn't appeal to us. I followed the recipe, but may try making a thicker sauce next time by adding flour and butter to the milk before pouring it over the fish. The milk remained very runny and seemed wasted in the bottom of the pan. I would probably also use fresh minced garlic next time because we love the taste of garlic. I think this has potential but didn't work great for me this go around.",
