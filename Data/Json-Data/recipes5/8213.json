I added a can of enchilada sauce (a secret weapon) cumin, chili powder, fresh jalape\u00f1o and red bell pepper, a small can of corn and half a can of black beans. I did not put the tomato mixture into the blender, I wanted it chunky. It came out delicious! Everyone really liked the addition of the cream. I also put in two large partially frozen chicken breasts, After the cooking process I removed them from the soup and shredded it.",
