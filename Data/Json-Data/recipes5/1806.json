                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe exactly as written along with another recipe on this site that was similar. What really sets this recipe apart from other recipes is the addition of cinnamon and cloves which isn't overpowering. In my opinion the cinnamon and cloves takes it to a different level lending a subtle sweetness almost and balancing out the other flavors. This recipe also isn't nearly as salty as others I've made and has the perfect amount of salt. The only reasons I'm rating 4 stars is because I felt it could use a tad more of the other seasonings (chili powder garlic powder cumin coriander oregano and dried chipotle pepper specifically) and my husband didn't care for the subtle hints of cinnamon and cloves. All of that is just minimal and personal taste preference though. Overall this is a good and tasty recipe for Chorizo and I hope more people give this recipe a try. I know I will make this recipe again! Thanks for the recipe!",
