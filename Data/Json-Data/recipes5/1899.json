Shape into meatballs and put in single layer on the bottom of the baking pan. Now here's the secret!! Chop a couple carrots and celery stalks and sprinkle over and around the meatballs. Cover with a can of tomato soup and a can of diced tomatoes with juice. Sprinkle with a little garlic powder and maybe a dash of worcestershire sauce. This makes delicious gravy to serve over mashed potatoes. Just be sure to bake long enough to make vegies soft. My mother always served this with green beans applesauce and cottage cheese. Make a double batch. It freezes well if you are lucky enough to have any leftovers!!",

We precook the rice so you don't have the issue with the rice not cooking. I use about a cup of cooked rice to about a pound of meat. Browned the meat balls for color. Used two cans of soup and reduced the water. Added a little bit of worchestshire sauce for zip. I think adding the veggies as another reviewer suggested is a great idea. I will try that next time.",

I also know these as porcupines but the main and most important (to my crew) ingredient is missing.. Chopped (or minced) onion. I add 1/2 to 1 onion which is more than my original recipe called for but it adds great flavor. Be sure to -brown- these don't just toss raw meatballs into the sauce (ick). This makes a yummy 'byproduct' of the browned bits in the pan.. the rice is not cooked soft (haven't added any sauce and finished cooking it yet..) but by the time the porcupine balls are browned there are crispy bits of browned onion/rice/hamburger bits. The cook and whoever is wandering by generally gets a taste. Add garlic and Worcestershire to the sauce mix as well as salt and pepper.",
