I used 2 cans of red kidney beans, drained and rinsed, and boiled them with the minced onion and a splash of water, uncovered, while mashing them with the back of a spoon, for about 10 minutes until I achieved the desired consistency. Then I added the walnut dressing and cooked for another 5 minutes. My only complaint about this recipe was that the dressing was too watery; 1/3 cup water was too much. I'd probably use about half of that amount next time to achieve a paste-like texture.",
