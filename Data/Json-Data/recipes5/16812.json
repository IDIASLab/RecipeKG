I had a ten inch pie shell so I doubled the recipe and used 3 tablespoons of flour instead of the corn starch (I don't like the cornstarch taste). It was perfect. Don't use frozen grocery store freezer section berries for this recipe. They are too moist you don't want to use raspberries frozen in a solid block not good for pies. Make this pie with fresh berries when they are in season. Or use your carefully home frozen fresh picked berries (Freeze fresh berries on a cookie sheet and transfer to a freezer bag after they are frozen Do this within a day don't freezer burn the berries. This way you don't have a big nasty frozen block of berries:) Good old fashioned recipe will make again!",
