While this was delicious on the asparagus I can imagine it would be just as good on any number of things - vegetables potatoes or any savory dish you'd use sour cream. Fresh light and creamy with just the right amount of cilantro herbiness. And even with that I would imagine this would also be very good with the herb(s) of your choice. This unique recipe has many interesting possibilities and variations. (Note: Steaming the asparagus on the grill wrapped in foil is sufficient. The initial step of cooking the asparagus in boiling water isn't necessary)",
