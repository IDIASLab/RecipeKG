This cake has all the flavor and richness of a traditional red velvet cake, but you won't feel guilty while enjoying it! With the use of whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, you are getting fiber and dessert in one! The frosting that goes with this cake is equally delicious and almost guilt free! This cake is delicious!",

I do not reccomend using fat-free as the texture of these will alter the final product and make for a runnier frosting. Also if you do not have butter milk on hand you can make your own! Mix 2 tablespoons white vinegar with fat free or reduced fat milk stire and let stand for 5 minutes. This is usually what I do since I have no need for a large bottle of buttermilk after I make this cake. You can also use egg whites instead of the egg beaters...instead of egg beaters use 4 egg whites. You may also need to add additional powdered sugar to stiffen the frosting. Remember that the nutritional information will change if you alter the recipe.",

It was an experiment to me and every single person I served it too agreed that it much more closely resembled a sweet dense red velvet muffin. The cake was extremely heavy and short. The icing was delicious but did not taste like normal icing and was difficult to spread because it was so thin. It was much more similar to overly sweet yogurt. I also found that the artificial sweetener was funny tasting and needed to add some sugar to keep the cake from tasting awful. The original recipe called for 1 1/2 cup sugar so I added about 3/4 cup sugar to this recipe. I would NOT recommend this recipe if you are trying to make something that resembles a traditional red velvet cake or trying to make a cake for other people. However if you're just trying to be healthy and eat it within your own home go for it!",

Low fat foods and fat free have lots of added chemicals to them preservatives and don't tell me wrong a TON of artificial sweetners whenever I bake I use natural cane sugar 1% cottage cheese 1 cup buttermilk because all the ones with no fat are really bad for you.
