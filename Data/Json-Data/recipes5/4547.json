I make risotto quite often, so I have gotten pretty good at finding that perfect creamy consistency, and with the few changes I made, I got it!  I did not use any butter, but instead I used all olive oil (about 3 T was enough), and then I added about 3/4 C onion (1 small), 3 chopped cloves of garlic, and sauteed over medium heat for about 5 minutes before adding the wine.  I did add 1/2 C wine, and cooked for a few minutes over medium until most had evaporated, then started adding my chicken broth (3 cans was the perfect amount, by the way) about 1/2 C at a time until it began to get creamy, but still had a slight bite to it. (This took about 20 minutes or so, but judge by texture more than time.)  Then I added about 1/2 C cream (I think a cup is way too much for only 1 1/2 C rice), 1/2 C fresh grated parm (it needed more then just 2 T), salt and pepper, the 2 T lemon juice, and the steamed broccoli (4 minutes in the microwave is perfect).  Add a bit of extra cream if it seems dry at this point.  All in all, great recipe; the lemon and broccoli with the creaminess of the rice was delicious!!!  ",

It is very good, and did not require any salt or pepper. I realized too late that I forgot the heavy cream on my trip to the store, but found a substitution on-line: 3/4 cup milk, 1/3 cup butter, and 1 tablespoon flour (if using 1% or skim milk). It worked perfectly. I like chopping the broccoli very fine, so each bite suggests broccoli rather than overwhelming the dish with large chunks.",

Since I don't have experience making risotto I'm not sure if I ended up with the 'right' consistency but I stopped adding broth after four cups and it was even a teeny bit mushy. But perfectly edible and tasty. I used a little more oil and a lot less butter forgot to put the chives in more asiago and no parmesan - though if I make again I think I would use just parm 'cause I always have it on hand and asiago is more expensive than it's worth. I also added a tbsp more lemon juice plus another quick drizzle at the end and it still didn't taste very lemony but that's alright. Overall quite good!",
