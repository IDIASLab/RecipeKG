I added a little salt to the thinly sliced the cucumber and let that set for about twenty minutes to let the cucumbers produce their own water then drained. I also used white wine vinegar vs. lemon juice as it's a bit milder. I chilled it for a couple of hours and it was delicious! A very nice combination of flavors and a great summer side dish - thanks!",

Because my grandparents had their own garden, they always used homegrown vegetables, which were grown without pesticides and picked before the deer and animals could get them. This means that they were smaller than the cucumbers you often find in the grocery store today. Because of this, you may need to increase the sour cream in this recipe, depending on how much cucumber you have. When I mnade this using 3 large cucumbers from the grocery store, I ended up putting a cup of sour cream. Adjust accordingly and also to your personal preferences. The best way to make this is to add what you like! More dill, less onion, greek yogurt... This is very versatile.",
