The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they were a little too sweet. I would cut down on the brown sugar a little next time but keep the honey because it helps it stick together. When these first come out of the oven they are soft and fall apart easily. I let them cool for about 2 hours and then cut then with a large sharp knife on a cutting board and it worked perfectly. Oh I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. I don't like raisins and cranberries seem to match better with cardamom anyway. I really love the flavor of these- you have to try these if you love cardamom! They are so simple to prepare too and took only a few minutes to put together.",

I let it cool for one hour before cutting and the result was perfect. Oh I did use the tip of another user to press it really hard before baking and also right after baking. I think this made the cutting after cooling much easier. They didn't fall apart at all. Thanks for the basic recipe!",
