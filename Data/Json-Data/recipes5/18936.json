I mixed the mustard and real syrup and poured spoonfuls over the top. I turned the pork chops after about 8 minutes and poured more of the glaze on. I did reduce the pepper to a single teaspoon but I think next time I'll only use a 1/4 of a teaspoon. And maybe get a spicer brown mustard. Overall great flavors easy dinner.",

I reduced the amount of salt because of the salt already in the soup mix. I used dijon mustard. I used pancake syrup insead of maple syrup. I mixed all of the ingredients together (I didn't have time to marinate). Put some olive oil in a frying pan (med-high heat). I seared the chops on both sides and then added the mixture to the pan, covered it and simmered the sauce and chops about 15 min. It was great!!!!!! My husband loved it. Will definitely make this again....probably the same way because I didn't have to plan ahead.",

Since I didn't have time to marinate I rubbed the pork chops with olive oil then applied the rub. Put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Then instead of broiling I placed them on the grill and grilled them. I grilled them at 375 degrees 5 minutes on each side then 1 minute with the glaze turned them over and 1 more minute with the glaze. They were awesome and my husband said he could eat them every night!!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!",
