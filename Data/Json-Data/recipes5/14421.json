I suggest adding another can of hominy. Secondly, if you are only going to use half of the salsa verde in the posole then why make double the amount needed?  The verde IS good but unless you are planning on eating it with chips or using it in another recipe I recommend halving that step. Don't forget the toppings...it all goes hand in hand. Be adventurous and throw some thinly sliced radishes on top if you dare...",
