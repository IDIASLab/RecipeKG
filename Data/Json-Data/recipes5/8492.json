I did not have white chocoate syrup but I had bakers real white chocolate and used 1/2 square of that. I had not thought to combine the two flavors in one drink so that was pretty interesting. The downside was it seemed like quite a bit of milk just from looking at the recipe compared to coffee. Although it tasted fine the end result made it taste to me more like mixed chocolate hot flavored milk than a coffee drink.",
