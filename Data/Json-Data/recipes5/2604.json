IF your oven runs hot, reduce cooking time by 5 minutes. Melt the butter (cool before adding to eggs)and blend well with the eggs then pour over noodles. COVER this for 50 minutes, then take off foil for last 10 minutes. I like to add paprika, garlic and sauteed onions. Adds a much needed flavor boost. Only rated it a 4, since I had to change a few things, to add flavor.",
