Since I was the first to make this recipe I followed exactly, even using the paper towel to drain my juice, a very nice tip by the way. I used my own homemade marinara sauce and had about 32 ounces, which was a nice amount to cover the meatballs and go over spaghetti noodles for four. I got 34 meatballs with my one inch melon ball scoop. The problem I had was the meatballs are very moist and were sticking to the pan and were falling apart, I had to be very delicate in cooking them and lost a few to crumbles. I will be making this one again, but think I'll put my meatballs on a baking sheet and bake them to brown them and then add to the sauce and simmer, hopefully that will keep them from falling apart.",

I used part regular parsley and part basil for the meatballs, but the marinara I used was an organic tomato basil marinara from Trader Joe's.  I followed the recipe as written otherwise.  I formed the meatballs earlier this afternoon and so they were cold when I added them to the pan.  My big mistake tonight was to use only my 10\" pan rather than the 13\" that would have made it all so much easier and without having to clean up my mess!  We have leftovers, and I think that's what I'll have for breakfast tomorrow!  Thanks, Chef!  EDIT:  After eating some of the leftovers, I wanted to add that you don't need to be afraid to add a little more flavor to these meatballs.  We thought that they could have used just a little more spice to them.  But, still, yum!",

Ricotta cheese sold in the small containers contains more than one cup.  If you use too much ricotta, of course the meatballs won't hold together that well. (They'll still taste great, though.)  So make sure you are measuring and not just dumping in the whole container as I suspect some people might have done.  Another winner from Chef John - thanks!",

I used dried parsley (1 Tbs.), basil (1 Tbs.) and ground marjoram (1/2 tsp.) because my own herb plants have not yet matured enough to harvest them and I wasn't about to go out and buy fresh when, I felt, the dried are absolutely fine in this recipe; 2.  I added about 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan to the meatball mixture because I cannot fathom meatballs without it; and 3.  I baked my meatballs in a preheated 350 degree oven (baking sheet lined with parchment) for 25 minutes, turning the balls once halfway through baking.  I simmered them in my favorite commercial marinara for the better part of the afternoon and served them over perciatelli pasta and with homemade garlic toast for dinner tonight (the leftovers will be used for meatball subs a little later this week).  My only beef is that although there was a pinch of cayenne pepper in the mixture, I could not detect any heat in the meatballs.  The next time I make these, and I will, I will add a good two pinches of cayenne.   Bravo, Chef John!",

Since I like larger meatballs, I made each one about 2 1/2 inches, which gave me 13 and baked them on 375* for about 20 minutes turning a few times.  I finished off in the pan as the recipe calls.  For my hubby who loves pasta, a chopped the meatballs and put on top of the pasta.  Myself just ate them as is.  This is a recipe that I will definitely make again.  Served this with Chef John's Stacked Tomato & Burrata Salad also on this site, and a crusty garlic french bread.  Thank you Chef John for all of your wonderful recipes.",

I fried 2 to test and found it to have a good texture but way too bland for our taste.  I added more cayenne, red pepper flakes, basil, thyme, oregon, mustard powder, and some grated romano.  I baked rather than fried and they were excellent.",
