I tried this recipe because I thought my 3 year old would turn his nose up to real gingerbread.  I would describe this as a cross between a gingerbread cookie and a butter/sugar cookie.  It was great.  My cookies did not run.  They looked great and tasted great.  They had a nice soft texture.  If you have to go out and get butterscotch pudding.....you better get one or two more boxes because we didn't get that many cookies out of this.  We had a blast making them.  Fun to eat too!  It made a nice mild tasting gingerbread cookie.  I was very pleased.",

(That in itself really sold me on this recipe as I tend to shy away from rolled dough recipes because they are time consuming and usually the dough is a hassle.) I did increase the cinnamon and ginger to taste and added cloves for a spicer cookie. I also used the instant pudding instead of the cook-and-serve and they turned out great. I did double the recipe and used half margarine and half butter. Baked 8-9 minutes instead of the 10-12 resulting in a softer chewier version of this classic. You definitely taste the butterscotch which I found to be a surprisingly pleasant alternative and I liked the fact that it didn't use molasses. I cut-out various sizes of large medium and small little buddies and decorated them with raisins and white piped icing and they came out adorable! Thanks for sharing Kim and this one is going in my family favorites cookbook",

The cookies were sturdy but not tough.  Somewhere between crispy and chewy.  I will make these again.  Definitely use a mixer or you won't get all the flour in.",

However I love butterscotch-anything and after reading the other reviews I thought I'd give this recipe a chance. I'm so glad that I did! YUMMY!!! Very easy to work with even my neighbor's young children were able to roll these out and cut them. I served them at a Christmas party last year with many other cookies. These were the first to go and when I asked my guests to take cookies with them as they left they all wanted to know where my \"secret stash\" of these were hidden. I appeased them by printing out copies of this recipe. Thank you Kim for a delicious and easy recipe!",
