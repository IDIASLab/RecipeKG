I tossed the raw cauliflower with vegetable oil, salt, pepper, paprika, and nutmeg, then roasted it in the oven for 20 minutes (stirring after 10 so it didn't stick).   I used Colby-Jack and a little Parmesan since that's what I had on hand, adding turmeric & curry powder to the sauce along with the salt and pepper.  Topped the casserole with one last sprinkling of Parmesan.\n\nOthers have mentioned the dish being watery, and I think roasting the cauliflower helped cut down on that.  I might replace some of the cream with sour cream next time to see if that makes a difference.  I would also add more cheese to the top--nothing like a browned, cheesy top to add zing to a casserole, yum!",

The other recipe started with saut\u00e9ing a few tbs of butter, onion, garlic, then adding the cream and cheese to pan and melt, then pour over the veggies.  It pours beautifully, but without heating it all together first, it doesn't pour well as this recipe states  bc the cheese is clumped up in the cream, and covering the veggie is uneven.  I was sorry I didn't just use my first recipe.  This takes 5 mins less bc of no butter, onion, garlic, and melting; but 5 mins more is needed!",
