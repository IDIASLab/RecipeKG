Using potatoes throws the balance of this recipe way off. The crispness of the tater tots quickly gets mushy and then each bite gives you a mouthful of mushy potato that overwhelms the flavors and textures of all the toppings. Plus the potatoes don't have the wonderful Mexican seasonings that nacho chips have so you lose that great \"zing\" with each bite. End result is a bland mouthful of mush.... Novel idea but not a better idea.",
