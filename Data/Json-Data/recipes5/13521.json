You can adjust and play around with the ingredients as you like (I'm not a fan of spinach) You can also make them not-diet-friendly by adding sausage, bacon, ham, other cheeses - I like jalepeno in mine with onion and mexican blend shredded cheese. Plain old pepper and egg are good too.  AND they can be frozen - so I grab a couple and head out the door to work, by the time I'm there a min or less in the microwave warms them up and I'm ready to have a healthy breakfast.  LOVE this recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!",
