The Bosc pears held up very well. As soon as I removed the pears from the oven I poured 2 oz. Amaretto over them and let the liqueur mix into the caramel. Delicious!",

I chopped up a bit of crystallized ginger and fresh grated nutmeg (idea from \"30 minute meals\" on the food network - they had used canned pears for their recipe). Because my fruit was very ripe (I used bartlett pears) I reduced the first cooking time by 10 minutes. Even then the fruit was just beginning to fall apart. I served the pears with vanilla ice cream instead of sour cream. The only minor complaint was eating the skin of the pear - they didn't like the texture. I will make this dessert again for my family and for company.",

I think some of the juicier pears may make the caramel sauce thinner but you can also always reduce it once your pears are done baking if it's too thin for you. I left my pears whole and cored them from the bottom then set them on the sour cream and dirzzled with the caramel sauce and added toasted walnut halves. Lovely and yummy. Thanks so much for the recipe!",

I cut the temp back to 375 because the caramel smelled like it might be starting to burn...next time I will start it out at 375. The caramel was still a bit \"crystally\" so you might want to start it first if you are decreasing teh cooking time for the pears. I served it w/ a scoop of sweetened whipped cream (that I added a tsp of almond extract too) instead of sour cream & garnished w/ chopped toasted almonds. Very enjoyable...will have again many times!",
