There is a slight discrepancy in step three regarding the bread. Regardless hindsight taught me that next time I will put both slices of bread -butter side up-in the same pan I used to cook the egg (without wiping it out). Then I'll flip one over layer the ingredients and top with the other bread slice butter side up. Then flip the whole sandwich. Because the sides that weren't toasted were soggy.
