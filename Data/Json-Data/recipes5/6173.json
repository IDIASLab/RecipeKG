(Meat needs a longer cook time and must be 165 degrees to be properly done)\nAlso using the bullion cubes as seasoning is raising the salt level of the finished product. You could avoid this by using liquid broth and marinate everything (meat separate from vegetables) prior to putting on kebobs.\nKebobs are a great cooking tool but preparation is a little work, a great way to get the family involved in preparation",
