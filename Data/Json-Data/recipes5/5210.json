My problem lies with being frozen cod, that I got from Fred Meyer/Kroger...and when I opened the bag after it thawed...it was fish floating in a lot of water. And my fish was alreaady crumbly. And was falling apart in the grilling process. So now I know what NOT to buy, the other thing was, I over seasoned my fish using almost all the seasoning the recipe made, and my fish was spicy. While my husband and daughter were screaming for more....I was grabbing for a bit of milk. I liked it but wasn't prepared for the heat. Other then that. I can totally make again! The seasoning can go along way, possibly 4 nice size fillets.",

I also found that the brand of Cajun seasoning can make a difference as well. I use Zatarain's Creole Seasoning. When I ran out and had to find a sub @ a grocery store on the way home from work (Tony Chackere's Original Creole Seasoning) it wasn't as good. Sorry Tony Chackere's your seasoning is good just not as good as the Zatarain's for this particular recipe. I also omit the 1/4 tsp salt from the recipe too as my seasonings all contain salt so extra salt is not necessary. I usually double the recipe and we eat it the next day for lunch (if there's any left over sometimes there isn't!). Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe. I've passed it along to friends and co-workers and everyone gives it the thumbs up. Making it tonight as a matter of fact!!!",
