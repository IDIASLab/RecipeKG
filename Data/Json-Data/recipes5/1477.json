After I added the olive oil to the skillet, I also added a shake of salt, tiny bit of black pepper, a shake of dry basil and a shake of garlic powder. I then added the 3 -   6oz salmon filets to the skillet.  I repeated the same added spices this time over the 3 salmon filets. I cooked  8 minutes, then turned the filets and cooked 5-7 minutes . I\u2019ll make this again soon.",

You could totally use whatever seasonings you prefer. The cook time was spot on for 3/4\" thick filets, BUT you really need to cook them at medium, not medium-low, to get any sort of color.",
