I don't know about you, but after a few days of eating Thanksgiving leftovers, no matter how tasty they originally were, I want something that makes me forget there's even turkey in it. Since ingredients like garam masala, spicy cheese, and peppers aren't typically used in the meal, they work wonderfully here to disguise the last of a holiday bird.",

I made way too much food and now have TONS of leftovers sitting in the fridge.:) We are tiring of eating the \"same old\" turkey dinner so I decided to give this a try. While my hubs and I both liked this we didn't LOVE it. Ironically enough this kinda reminds me of turkey tetrazzini (with a twist!). My hubs compared this to tuna noodle casserole (huh???).... To accommodate our small family I halved this (the last thing I wanted were LEFTOVER leftovers!). Using my small 8 x 8 in. square baking dish worked perfectly. The only downside is that I now have a half can of soup I don't know what to do with.:( Other than adjusting the serving size my only other change was to use all red bell pepper (personal preference). NOTE: Use garam masala if you can find it. Although curry is a suitable substitute nothing compares to the wonderful spicy aroma of this complex spice mixture. Ditto for the tarragon. Thanks for sharing your creative spin on boring (snore snore) leftovers John!:-)",

I halved the recipe and followed the ingredients except for the garam masala which I couldn't find at the two stores I went to. Instead I used a little curry and a little cinnamon. It was also hard to find the egg noodles but Sprouts did have them. This was really good the first night that we ate this but with the leftovers the next night we found it to be a little dry and with some of the flavor disappearing. I was glad to have some of Chef John's Creme Fraiche (yum!) to dollop on top to take care of that! This is a good staple casserole that I will make again. Thanks Chef!",

                "reviewBody": "I really appreciated how creative this recipe was in contrast to other recipes (like pot pies!) that you can use for leftover turkey. The curry sounded weird at first but don't skip it...it's what makes this recipe really good. Also be sure to use the pepper jack--it really compliments the curry and brings out some unique flavors. I might add a bit more cheese next time like some sharp cheddar as well. Though I thought using potato chips as the crunchy topping was really neat their texture didn't hold up well (too thin) with all the sauce especially for next-day servings. I think I would go back to using cheese toast or croutons next time or maybe even try something like Cheezits or Triscuits to get the cheesy/salty flavor. I followed the amount of milk and condensed soup exactly and it made the perfect consistency of sauce--usually I find casserole recipes end up being too runny but this one is spot on. It was great because I always cook too much pasta when I'm making dinners and this was a great way to use up leftover pasta too. I used elbow macaroni and they held up really well probably better than egg noodles would. I'll definitely make this again.",
