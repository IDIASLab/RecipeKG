When I first mixed it up and tasted it, I was not impressed, but after sitting in the fridge overnight, it was awesome, and good as any blue cheese dressing I've had anywhere.  I used it on a buffalo blue cheese panini for dinner last night and on a lettuce wedge for lunch today.  It's good, but it's only as good as the blue cheese you buy, so go ahead and splurge on a good one!",

The butter milk, may, and sour cream were perfectly proportioned. But cared way too much of a bitter sour taste. If I were to rate it as originally made I would sadly give it 3 stars because of the over welming taste, after omitting the lemon and the sherry it is a sure fire 5 start. Wish it could be a 6!!! The taste is awesome. I will for sure keep this recipe! I would like to make it again but maybe use each one teaspoon of lemon and sherry. Thank you for sharing it! Puts in mind of one my mom use to make!",
