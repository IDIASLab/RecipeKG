I use the entire amount of yogurt in the large carton. mine was 4 cups so I increased the agave syrup to taste. I increased the lemon to an entire lemon. I then zested the entire lemon as well for the extra flavor you get from the natural lemon oils. I love mint so I added about 3-4 more leaves and finely chopped them. I didn't want to drag out my ice cream maker so I poured it back into the original yogurt container and tossed it into the freezer. I'll probably stir it every hour or so until it's firm.",
