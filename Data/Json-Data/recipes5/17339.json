Unfortunately I don't have her recipe and my mouth was watering when I found this one. However it was a huge disappointment. It is nothing like the original which were chewy and not so terribly sweet and sticky. I believe this recipe has too much sugar and not enough flour. The base has so much sugar that it gets too hard. The other ingredients are probably about right. I would like to see someone come up with one of the more satisfactory old recipes. I'm sorry to have to call this one a flop.",
