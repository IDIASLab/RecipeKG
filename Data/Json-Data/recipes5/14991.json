He ate his full serving though, and agreed to have some with chicken for his leftover lunch tomorrow, so he liked them okay.  He did ask me if these were seasoned with saffron, and I think they'd be good that way--but I LOVE saffron.  Turmeric, which I like, but not as much, is a harsher flavor.  Nice idea, and it works pretty well, so I'd try with different seasonings.  I used red potatoes and didn't peel the skin--part laziness, part wanting the nutrition from it.  I prefer mashed potatoes with the skin anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!",
