It would be fantastic on pumpkin bread. Thanks!",

I made this recipe and put it in freezer bags so I could have it over time. I thawed it out put it into a jar and have been having it on toast in the morning. Even shared it with family as a gift and they are all loving it as well. They like that it s a veggie instead of a fruit butter since it sounds healthier. I like the taste and the apple juice in it gives it a good flavor. It does not make it taste like apple butter of course but it is good. I really like it. Now that I have given it all out I want to go buy more acorn squash the next time it s on a good sale again. Thanks for the recipe.",
