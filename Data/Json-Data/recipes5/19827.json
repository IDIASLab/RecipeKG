The spiciness is nicely offset by the sweetness of the caramelized onions.  It's also super simple to make. I did double the cayenne because I like spicy and omitted the onion powder (didn't have any.) I also used a whole onion which was the right choice.  One note - if the salmon is thick then use a lower heat because the paste will burn the top while the inside remains raw.",

We cooked the fillets on the flesh side down first and then flipped them on the skin side so that the marinade could form a crust and seal in moisture and also because we thought we could then cook them on the skin side a little longer if necessary. We diced the onion instead of mincing it and used half an onion. The onion was delicious and next time we will use a whole one. This was very flavorful sweet and savory and not too spicy (but we LOVE spicy foods). Next time we'll add more cayenne to better suit our tastes. Overall this was a fantastic recipe!",
