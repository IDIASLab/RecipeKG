I was a little confused with 2 cups cocoa that the recipe uses, so I used just one cup and it was perfect. I used Orange coconut cookies recipe from this site to substitute tea biscuits and I utilized all cookies. Then I used just about 1/2- 3/4 cup butter and no more. And I think the mixture was a little sticky even with this amount of butter. I added a little coconut flakes. Be sure to refrigerate the salami completely.",

I didn't have cognac so a used blackberry brandy, I had on hand.2.) Used crazins (dried cranberries) instead of raisins. 3.) Instead of tea biscuits, I used rice crispies. Also I added some flaked coconut. Tried to keep the amounts that were in the recipe. 4.) I added  1tspn.orange extract. Delicious and decadent!\nIt all firmed up really well.
