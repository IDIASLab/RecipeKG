I found myself wanting a little of the sauce over the finished salmon but the hazelnuts did make this very tasty. Thanks for the recipe! EDIT: In thinking more about this dish I wish I would have saved off a little of the marinade in the beginning thickened it a little and poured it over the finished fish. I'll have to try that!",
