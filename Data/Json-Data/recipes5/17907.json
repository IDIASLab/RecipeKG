To be fair I did use a bigger can of tomato sauce initially than was called for though. In the end we liked the flavor but when I get around to submitting a photo you'll notice how amazingly un-pretty this recipe is. The green yellow red and whitish beans floating in a bright red sauce (not to mention the green beans being so long and obviously green beans) make it look...odd to say the least. I may try this recipe again with different beans & extra dark brown sugar...",
