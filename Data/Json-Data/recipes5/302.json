As you can see from my pics the bell peppers fell apart and I could not lift them from the pot. The flavor was good- The recipe calls for random Italian spices so I used my imagination and the blend turned out nice! I used thin sliced rare roast beef from the deli counter - I would definitely put this on some crusty French bread as a sandwich- the flavor is delish- the recipe as-is does not work.",
