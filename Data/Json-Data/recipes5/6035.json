I always freeze my bananas before they go bad for smoothies, so I had them frozen already, and had some cucumbers from our family\u2019s garden. One thing I would recommend is peeling the skin of the cucumber beforehand! I didn\u2019t think of it until it was too late. That is the only funky thing in my ice cream. But it\u2019s a great flavor. I added some milk and butter to make it creamier and more like ice cream. It taste great and it\u2019s fun to have healthy ice cream! Super easy!",
