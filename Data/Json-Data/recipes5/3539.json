I added some garlic and it really wasn't necessary at all.  The lemon juice made it taste really bright and clean, and reduced fat cream cheese made it taste indulgent.  I served it with brown rice and grilled chicken.  I had enough extra sauce that it tasted great over the rice.  This isn't a really pretty side dish, but a completely delicious one to accompany a super quick mid-week meal.  From pulling ingredients out of the refrigerator to sitting down to eat this was done in under 15 minutes including grilling the chicken.",

Definitely needed more salt but left that up to everyone else to add to their preference.  1 BUNCH is not a good quantity description and you really need more than that as fresh spinach cooks down tremendously.  It would be better to make the sauce on the side and allow everyone to add how much they want on to their individual portions.  WIth those changes it would work better.  It still lacked flavor for the majority of us.  I like the concept but it needs tweaking.  Will not make again as the recipe is.",

I defrosted the spinach with 1/4 c. water in a small saucepan then proceeded as directed. I did reduce the lemon juice slightly as suggested by previous reviewer though not by half - maybe halfway between 1/8 and 1/4 cup. Also added about 1/2 tsp. white pepper and a tiny pinch of nutmeg - just enough to cut the tang a bit. The dish was still very lemony & my husband LOVED it!",

As written it is very good but the next time I tried adding one clove of pressed garlic with the water and used garlic salt instead of the the plain salt. With the addition of the garlic I would definitely rate this as a \"5 Star\" recipe. Also I have to double this recipe when I make it because we can't get enough...even my picky 12-year old loves it!",
