It just doesn't taste nearly as good with only little dressing. I usually use about 3/4 of the dressing, but you may use less or more. Enjoy!",

I added another TBS olive oil and TBS lemon juice/garlic to the dressing because it just wasn't enough to cover the salad and drizzle over the tuna. Let me mention that I don't like a lot of dressing saturating my salad or food so it was just right. I made the dressing early in the day and let it marinate in the frig for several hours it was quite tasty and I didn't find it to be too oily at all.",

Doubled the ingredients in the dressing recipe except the oil leaving it at 2 T. Salt and peppered and rubbed the tuna with sesame oil before grilling 2-1/2 minutes on each side. The flavor of the mint and cilantro was surprisingly delicious and fresh.",
