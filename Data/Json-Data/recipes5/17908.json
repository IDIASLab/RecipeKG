I basted by dipping the buts into the sauce every hour and placing back into the smoker. I used a commercial smoker with a sheet pan at the bottom to catch the drips. I took those dripping and poured them into the sauce when I had finished smoking. (After wrapping in foil and adding sauce.) I then cooked the meat overnight at 165 (about 15 hours). The sauce was chilled over night so I could remove the fat. In the morning I shredded the pork with forks and added it back to the sauce. I held it this way for 24 hours. Next I simmered it to warm the pork and served it. Many people chefs other students commented on how good the pork was and how much they enjoyed the flavors. Excellent recipe.",

It was a little tiring to baste the meat every hour but it was so worth it! I smoked my 9lb pork butt overnight @ 225 using Mesquite wood chips (11 hours). I basted and added new chips every hour or so. After 11 hours I took the pork out of the smoker and placed it in layers of tin foil and poured the 1c sauce over it as recommended and then covered it tightly. I then cooked it for an additional 4 hours without rebasting. Removed from smoker and let it cool for 30min before shredding the meat. I put the shredded meat it in the crockpot and added the additional 1c sauce and mixed. It was absolutely fantastic!!! Can't wait to make it again. Even my picky kids loved it and they never like anything!",
