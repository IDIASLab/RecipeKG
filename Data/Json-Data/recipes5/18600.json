I have never liked heavy, sugary buttercream frostings (or the stuff you get from the store in a can) and this is exactly the kind of frosting I love - light, fluffy, and not to sweet. I did double the recipe to fully frost my 9\"layer cake (outside only, not filling, though I had a bit extra so I probably could've filled it too) and I also stabilized it by adding a teaspoon of gelatin that had been dissolved in 1/4 cup of water in the microwave after whipping. Wonderful! I'll be using this again :)",

I think it could a little more but I was trying to get it to match a very dark chocolate cake so it might be okay as is on a lighter cake. Definitely make this without hesitation!",
