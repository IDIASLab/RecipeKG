After the meat came out of the oven, I sliced off a small piece, and OMG could I taste that spice.  I told my husband there was one thing I didn\u2019t like about the meat but didn\u2019t tell him what, and asked him to take a bite.  He immediately said it\u2019s the cinnamon, and I don\u2019t like it either.  We live fairly close to a large Greek community in Florida, and I\u2019ve had many, many delicious gyros over the years, and never tasted even a hint of cinnamon.  This recipe certainly measures up very well, but WITHOUT the cinnamon.  This is so easy to make, can be made in advance, and I love how quickly you can get a good quality gyro on the table in the evening.  The cinnamon may be a personal taste issue with me, but I\u2019ll be making this recipe again, and will just omit the cinnamon making it a 5-star recipe for me.  \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022UPDATE 5.5.18: Had some in the freezer so I used the mandolin to slice the meat which cut it thinner than possible with a knife, perfectly to be  honest .  Just really tasty.  This recipe is better than most gyros you'll find at restaurants.",

I think I may have wasted some of the flavor by not doing that.?",
