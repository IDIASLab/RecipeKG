(Fresh sausages would fall apart.) I use uncured sausages, cutting them (& the carrots) \u00bc\" thick. The sausages tend to come in 12 oz. packages, not 20, but that's enough. I use EVOO, red potatoes, lots of carrot, a sweet onion & only pale green cabbage leaves, discarding any unsalvageable dark green outer leaves & using no white inner leaves. (So I buy a larger cabbage to get more pale green leaves!) I use only 1 cup of unsalted chicken broth. No flour. I start by cooking the carrot slices in EVOO, & add the onion, meat & cabbage, in order, as I finish prepping them. When they're nearly cooked, I add the potatoes, broth & a lot of boiling water, heated separately, to cover. I bring the pot rapidly to a boil & cook for just 10-15 min. until the potatoes are done. I drain off all the liquids. (The broth doesn't interest me, & it carries away a lot of salt from the meat.) I drizzle on a fruity EVOO. The results always resemble Bibi's own photo.",
