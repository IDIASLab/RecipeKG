So I managed to put together what I could remember from reading the recipe one time! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is my version is a little different..but still great! I did not use jalapenos or peppers--but green onions and tomatoes. I also improvised a dressing with sour cream salsa and Ranch mixed together. The last difference was I used bow-tie pasta. I refrigerated it overnight then just before serving added the shredded cheese. It was a huge hit!",
