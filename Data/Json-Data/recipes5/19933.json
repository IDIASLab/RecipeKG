I changed the seasonings and increased the cooking time and I have been very pleased with them every time. They're really tender and the meat is so flavorful that you don't have to add BBQ sauce unless you want to. My neighbor is the one who told me about the fajita seasoning, and she was right on!",

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of reducing the sauce. I ended up with close to 2 cups of sauce after braising which took 20 min on medium heat to thicken up. The sauce was also VERY salty from 1/2 cup of fajita seasoning and I ended up adding about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a Tbsp of dijon mustard and it was perfect. **TIP** do not forgo the broil process, this gives the meat a nice sticky, caramelized coating that is the key to finishing the flavor of these ribs. One final thing, don't omit the fajita season (I used Fiesta brand), it helps to tenderize and lends lots of flavor. I will definitely be making these again and I think I'll try some liquid smoke next time.",

I cant wait to try a brisket using this recipe as a guideline I finally did try it with the brisket, bake at 300 for 5 hours, it melts in your mouth, my husband and kids have asked for the brisket and ribs again and again",

                "reviewBody": "Oh.  My.  God.  These ribs are to die for!!  I made them for Memorial Day weekend.  My son told me he was only going to have \"a couple\" because he had another bbq to attend.  He ended up eating a rack and a half and called his friend to say he would be late! My husband couldn't stop eating them either.  I made them exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing!  They were the most finger lickin', fall off the bone ribs I ever had.  I loved them so much I went into my recipe box and threw out every other rib recipe I had in the house.  I cooked down the liquid as stated and it made an incredible sauce.  We were tasting it as it was cooking down and could barely leave it alone.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It is absolutely fabulous.  My only regret is I can't give it more than five stars.  I'd give it ten if I could.  Thanks so much for a fabulous recipe that my family will be enjoying for many years to come.  I can't wait to make them again....4th of July is coming up soon!  Seriously, try this recipe.  You won't be sorry.  I think the people who had problems weren't doing something right.  After they came out of the oven, I finished them off outside on the grill.  I used Sam Adams summer ale for the beer but I think any light color ale would work.  I wouldn't use Guinness or a dark beer.  I didn't find low sodium fajita mix.  I used Old el Paso regular and it was awesome!!  I didn't notice any salty taste at all.  Mmmmmmm, mmmmmm, GOOD!!",

I do not know what I did that made these turn out this way. I have reviewed the recipe again to see what I forgot but cannot find anything. I will have to throw these away. We were really looking forward to our rib dinner, too. Many have obviously had great success with this recipe but I am not sure that I will give it another go in the future or not.

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was pretty easy to follow, especially when it was my first time making ribs and I had only 6 hours to cook it.  So my review might help those who want to make ribs but have less than 7 hours.  I made it with three racks, and did not have time to refrigerate before cooking.  I had cut the racks to make four pans.  It did not affect the tenderness or taste.  I also did not use the garlic, honey or mustard since I was short on time and wanted to get the ribs in the oven so they could cook for the four hours.  After four hours I poured about a cup of the drippings with two cups of sweet baby rays in a sauce pan and boiled it down.  After flipping the ribs over, I brushed the ribs with the sauce and left the temp at 250 and repeated @ 3 times for @ 15 minutes.  I kept them in the oven b/c there were too many racks of ribs to move to the counter or top rack to broil or grill outside.  Also, people were hanging out in the kitchen (like they always do) and I didn't want to navigate around them to get to the grill.  I made the foil packets for the ribs, and put them in foil trays.  I think this worked better than the cookie tray since the juices from the ribs and beer sauce spilled out of the foil packets and would have have been hard to manage if they were in a shallow cookie sheet. Plus easy clean up! Hope my review helps shy rib cooks!",

                "reviewBody": "Wow! These were the best ribs I have ever eaten! It takes a lot for me to really want to make a recipe again and this was honestly the tenderest, tastiest wrack of ribs I've ever eaten for such little work. I will never make ribs any other way again ever. I made a few minor changes and kept the method the same. I have a lot of spice blends from Penzey's so I decided to use a heavy dose of some Northwoods Fire mixed with a handful of brown sugar instead of the seasoning mentioned. Also, It is July and I did not want to heat up my apartment with having an oven on for 3 hours so I used my cusinart convection toaster oven and baked the ribs for 3 hours at 350 on the convection setting and they were meltingly tender beyond what I can describe to you. The meat had the most wonderful flavor that completely permeated it. Oh, also, I have something called a Deni meat tenderizer which I poked throughout the ribs after I rubbed it with seasoning so the seasoning really penetrated the ribs and I didn't give them any marinating time at all, I just put them in the oven right after covering with the spice rub. To finish, I did not use the pan juices because I felt that there was a lot of fat that drained off the ribs during cooking so I brushed a tad of Bullseye BBQ sauce which was voted the top store BBQ sauce from Cooks Illustrated. I finished under the broiler for about 10 minutes and these ribs were one of the best things I've ever made and I cook all the time.Thanks for a great recipe!",

Thanks for posting the recipe! Please note: many reviewers have commented that the sauce didn't thicken. I've had great success using a \"fat separator.\" It looks like a measuring cup and it has a spout that stems from the bottom of the cup. Simply pour all the gravy in and let it rest about a minute and the fat will float to the top. Pour the gravy into the pan but keep an eye on the separator and do not pour in the clear fat. Discard the fat but don't pour it down the drain or your pipes will clog. Your sauce will thicken I promise! Hope that helps.",
