It was very similar to something we ordered last week at a local sushi restaurant, only we paid $12 for a TINY portion at the restaurant and were able to make a massive amount of this (with sashimi grade ahi, even) for under $15.  My only problem is that it was extremely salty because of all the soy sauce. Thus, I recommend using low sodium soy sauce.",
