Cooked the green beans and the rice as instructed. The feta gave this a nice twang, but when I tasted it I felt it needed something more. I added in some minced garlic and a drizzle of sesame oil (maybe 1/2 teaspoon) and that did the trick, SO GOOD! We really, REALLY enjoyed this along w/ our fish for dinner tonight...Thanks so much for the idea, I will be making this again and again~YUM!!!!",
