We like that lemon flavor!! Also, I used cheddar (hard) slices and I think I will do the shredded cheddar and I will try and spread the cream cheese on (instead of chunky).  Maybe that will prevent it from oozing out!! :) \r\n\r\nOverall, this is an excellent recipe and VERY flavorful and to be honest, VERY easy to make. . .a must try for any household!",

Plus the combination of three different cheese was an indication to me that this was going to be tasty. I did make a couple of changes... First I pounded my chicken breasts down thin. Second I used light shredded cheddar cheese that I combined with softened light cream cheese until it was blended. to stuff the chicken and rolled the chicken securing  with toothpicks. I dipped the chicken in egg and milk then the bread crumb mixture to form a light coating. I then drizzled it with the melted butter mixture and baked it according to the directions. The result was a very moist and flavorful chicken bursting with a delicious cheese filled center!",

I used far less cream cheese and threw in some bacon along with the cheese mixture.  Also used Panko crumbs as opposed to breadcrumbs.  I thought the lemon garlic butter was the best thing about this dish, and, if making again, I would ditch dunking them in milk before breading and just use the lemon garlic butter (pouring any remaining over the chicken).  I think that would add tremendous flavor.  Again, thanks for the recipe....it was nice and different!",

This was a heavenly savory recipe  - and great for company! Best of all, I made the full recipe and froze 6 of the chicken breasts. They reheated beautifully as an at-work lunch. What a treat!

Well you know what they say cheese makes everything taste better! I butterflied the chicken breasts as directed in the recipe (rather than rolling as suggested by other reviewers) and it worked fine. Some cheese melted out but not that much. I did take the suggestion of reducing the amount of cream cheese. I reduced it by about a quarter but I think half would be better next time. I served this with pasta and we ended up cutting up our chicken breasts into bite size pieces and mixing it with the pasta. On top of the pasta I just had a mixture of melted butter lemon juice minced garlic and dried basil. It was delicious! I will definitely make this again. It takes a little prepping but it's worth it.",

My boyfriend liked it but thought it was too rich as well and could only be made once in a great while. If i make it again i will not give it the breaded topping use a white cheese and serve it with a tomato sauce.",
