I made the sauce according to direction but I didn't have any steak sauce and used a splash of soy sauce and put a bit more garlic in. The 3 men in my house went ga-ga over this. I thought it might taste a smidgen too ketchupy but the guys  absolutely loved it and said I was crazy - lol. This did make a gooey sauce that stuck to the ribs and didn't run off. The meat literally fell away from the bone. We will make this again and again. Thank you for a new family favorite.",

When they were done I transfered them to a baking pan and spread \"The Sauce\" on both the bottom and tops and baked at 350 for 1/2 hour. Wonderful! I had cut \"The Sauce\" recipe in 1/2 and still had a ton left. A few days later I made a oven roasted brisket from Paula Deen and served the remaining sauce with it. Dh now will eat it no other way! Will definatly use \"The Sauce\" when ever we BBQ! Thanks for posting!",

I plan on using this sauce for different meats also.  I had someof the sauce left over so I brushed it on Chicken breasts.  They were just as good as the ribs.  It is the sauce that is the real killer in this recipe.  I like to just make batches of the sauce and keep it in the fridge for just about any type of meat.  Give it a try.",

I added finely chopped onion and bottled chili sauce and soy sauce to taste. It was excellent! I always parboil ribs before grilling, but I've never finished them off in the oven as this recipe directs.  The texture and flavor of the meat really reminded me of carolina pulled pork. YUMMY!!!  One suggestion -- Add a quatered onion, some crushed fresh garlic, peppercorns and salt to the cooking water. It really adds depth of flavor to the meat itself. I've also added beer and/or apple cider vinegar to the cooking water in past. Mmmm!!",

We used Sonny's Mild BBQ sauce for a sweet sauce but the pork came out like Carolina BBQ - tender enough to eat with a fork.
