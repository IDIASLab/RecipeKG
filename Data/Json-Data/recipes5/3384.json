I did change the way I cooked the chops though: I covered the pan and cooked it on a very low flame for 20 minutes turning the chops over once during cooking. They were tender and moist. I also used 1/3C milk with only 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch and the sauce thickened up nicely without any lumps! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I browned pork chops in the oil then set them aside and did the sauce. I used about 1-1/2 cups of apple juice 1/2 cup milk coarse Dijon mustard and fresh parsley. I did adjust the seasonings a bit to compensate for the extra liquid. I put the pork chops in the sauce to finish cooking. We liked this a lot with the changes it's a great idea.",

I used orange juice instead of lemon juice since I didn't have any in the house. It was a sweet glaze on the outside with the salty pork taste in the middle. I didn't use all of the thickening flour mixture and had to add a little more apple juice to help the consistency but when the pork was done cooking (slowly) the sauce had reduced too much. It turned out great though. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and corn.",
