Put the pizza dough on floured board (wood or cookie sheet) and slice the dough so you get long, 1\"-2\" pieces of dough.  Just roll the hot dogs, sausages, polish sausages, or whatever in long sliced up pizza dough  and wrap them around each hot dog or sausage spiraling from top to bottom.  Boil in 4 c. boiling water water with 2 T baking soda  for 1 minute, put on an oiled cookie sheet with a few grains of uncooked oatmeal, or uncooked cream of wheat on the sheet to prevent sticking and bake at 375 until they are done and browned on the top (slightly less brown than John's) like a pretzel - about 20-25 minutes.  Even if you accidentally cook them as brown as John's, they will probably be fine.  I've made 50 batches of these and none of them have ever failed.  Dip them in mustard and ketchup if you'd like. They get rave reviews from my kids, their friends, and, even, adults.",
