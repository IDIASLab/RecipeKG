We were a little nervous of trying it because it's completely different from the kind of food that we normally eat but I had grapefruit I needed to get rid of and this was definitely the way to go about doing it. The only thing I changed was that I used a large red jalapeno instead of the red chile pepper because that's what I had on hand and 1/2 tsp of grade B maple syrup instead of brown sugar for the same reason. I think next time around I will cut the amounts for the liquid ingredients in half and let the grapefruit drain over the sink after it's been peeled and de-membraned because it was pretty soupy towards the bottom. Otherwise the flavor was amazing. We will definitely be making this again!",
