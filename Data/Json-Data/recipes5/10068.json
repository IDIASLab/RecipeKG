I had the same issue as others where I fried them and then finished them off in the oven at 400 for about a 1/2 hour. I only had panko on hand and that worked great. I also used one pound hot and one pound of regular breakfast sausage to add some kick & doubled the recipe ingredients (except for pepper). Using two pounds of sausage I was able to make 11 scotch eggs. Next time I will probably be able to squeeze out about 14.",

The ones I'd had didn't have the bread crumb coating.  It makes them taste even better!!!  Baking them (turning once) on a broiling pan helps get rid of some of the fats.  Spicy brown mustard or sweet jams are good for dipping depending on your personal tastes.  \n\nGreat for brunches.",

In some batches I've used half pork sausage and half turkey sausage and in others I've used all turkey sausage and they both turn out great. I like to add about a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder 1/4 tsp of additional sage and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to kick up the flavor of the sausage. It's really easy to boil the eggs and prepare the sausage mixture the night before then put together and broil in the oven the next morning for breakfast. Great recipe thanks UKLAINE!",
