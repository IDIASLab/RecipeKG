My beets didn't take 15 minutes to cook, they took 30.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect.  I didn't add the hard boiled egg to the mixture.  Instead I topped each bowl of soup with the eggs and a bit of sliced dill pickles.  SOOOOOO GOOOD!!!!",

Perfect summer food although it may be a bit \"challenging\" for pickier palates.  The fresh lemon juice is very important.  Try serving it in a martini glass- so pretty. Other chlodnik recipes include chopped radishes as well.  I really enjoyed this, thanks BJoslin!",

Since my beet greens weren't very good anyway, I left them out entirely, and I added the lemon juice to the beets after they  cooked and cooled. I also topped the soup with the hard boiled eggs before serving instead of adding them directly to the soup. Overall though, it's a really great (and beautiful) soup. Makes for an easy and nutritious lunch to take to work too!",
