One could easily fry those same ingredients in a couple of teaspoons of butter. Also after you fry them it tells you to drain all excess grease which I view as an unnecessary waste of butter. In addition to this although a plentiful amount of flavorful spices are used in this recipe the cheese ball is very bland. I recommend using instead of 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes 3 tablespoons and 2 of cayenne pepper.",

Leave as much of the spices that are attached to the shrimp as you can more flavor in the cheese ball as to the cup of butter well it sure makes the flavor great I wouldn't think you could fry that much onion and garlic with a couple of tsps. I have also made this butter sauce up let cool for awhile (so the shrimp don't cook) and added shrimp and refrigerate for the day. Then Scewer and grill these are great!",
