Everything grilled up quite nicely with the exception of the scallops. I decided to save a couple dollars and go frozen. This was a mistake! The texture was not great! I'll be buying fresh from now on. Otherwise even the veggies were great! Use small whole mushrooms too. They survive the grilling a lot better than cuts quarters/halves of larger ones. The couscous salad had amazing flavor and was wonderful as a left over the next day as well. I'll be making both again! Thank you!",

This was very good all the way down to the couscous! Now I was not able to get fresh scallops and that was NOT a great idea to use frozen!! Most of the scallops almost seemed like they was going to fall apart. (yes a few did) They just did not have the texture that fresh has. I would go as far as saying when I make this again cause I will YUMM! I am going to try frozen shrimp if I can not get my hands on fresh next time. This is my third time trying out couscous and this recipe I am finding it so flavorful. Although I did leave out the Feta since I did forget that at the store. I say even if you are skeptical like I was do give this a try I don't think you will be disappointed!",
