I added Worcestershire Sauce, paprika, bay leaves, crushed garlic, fresh cracked black pepper and cooked the additional last hour. I did not cube my potaotes or dice my onions or celery into 1/2\" slices and I'm glad I didn't. I quartered both my potatoes and onions, cut the celery into 2\" pieces and used baby carrots. Veggies would have turned into mush had I followed the instructions. Beef broth would have been a much better choice than water, which is where I think the blandness came from. I would much rather use a slow cooker than baking in the oven for 5 hours. Not a recipe I would make again.",
