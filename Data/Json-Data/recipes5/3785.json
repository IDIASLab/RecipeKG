The drink itself is rather tart but w/ the sugar on the glass it becomes sweet & tart. Yummm! I copied IHeartShane & used a lemon drop in place of the cherry & I also added a tiny sprig of mint. Beautiful drink & tasty too! UPDATE 5/31/06---I made this drink again tonight but instead of using the triple sec I subbed 1/2 of the amount w/ lemon simple syrup (it's too sweet to use as much as I would triple sec) & then added just a bit more lemon juice. (Other than this change I made it the same as the last review.) I also tried to be clever & garnished this w/ a couple of pieces of candied lemon peel. Don't do that.;o) It rehydrated perfectly wonderful addictive sugary lemon candies back into bitter leathery lemon peels. The lemon simple syrup instead o the triple sec is a really good idea. The candied lemon peel garnish is a very bad idea. Oh well; you win some you lose some.",
