When the sprouts were cooked through, I took them and the kielbasa out and put them in a bowl to hold.  I then added more oil to the pan and some roasted garlic smashed with salt.  I then deglazed the pan with beer, and kept slowly adding more beer to get to the consistency I wanted.  I added some dijon mustard and salt and pepper to taste, then added the kielbasa and sprouts back into the pan and tossed to coat.  I served it with parmesan and cracked pepper polenta... delicious!",
