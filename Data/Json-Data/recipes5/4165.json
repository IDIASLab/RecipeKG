Edit: For those of you having trouble with curdling it is key that the top of the double boiler be ABOVE (not sitting in) the simmering (not boiling) water to prevent overheating. Also make sure you whisk in the lemon juice OFF the heat. America's Test Kitchen just released their recipe and it is almost identical in technique. As for the amount of lemon juice this is how it was served to me my entire childhood and I always found it bland at restaurants so experiment to find your personal preference!",
