I don't squeeze fresh lemons either though I'm going to try that way next. Every way I have tried tabouli (except a prepackaged mix- not the same at all)it is always good.

Just put an amount of dry bulgur in a bowl and add the same amount of water and let it sit for 30 or so minutes - no cooking necessary. While the bulgar sits soaking in the water I chop up all my other ingredients which for me is cucumber tomato (the outside edge not the juicy fleshy inside part) red or yellow onion and LOTS of parsley. The mint can be overwhelming so I don't add it. I also add a lot of salt and put much more lemon juice than olive oil but that's because I prefer the lemon taste. Great basic recipe though!",
