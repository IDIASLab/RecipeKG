I only marinated the chicken for about 30 minutes and I didn't think it absorbed much flavor from the marinade so next time I would leave it in a little longer. I added a touch of honey to the dressing to take the edge of f of the acidity. The salad with the chicken was the perfect bite. I loved the punch of citrus with the bitter arugula.",

My pounded out chicken was thicker than the 1/4\" suggested and so took a little longer to bbq and my tomatoes were the cocktail tomatoes rather than the required ones. I marinated the chicken for an hour rather than the 15 minutes asked for. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I almost forgot the zest for the arugula but a late addition didn't make much difference. If your lemon is quite tart don't be afraid to add a very little sugar to the dressing. We enjoyed this dinner! Thanks!",
