I also didn't have cloves so I added some nutmeg instead. I thought it was just a touch too sweet though. Next time I'll probably add a bit of orange juice to offset the sweetness. And since the recipe didn't say whether or not to drain the sweet potatoes I drained most of the juice and put in about 1/3 cup. Overall a fantastic recipe. =)",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is similar to the sweet potato recipe my mother used to make. She is from Barbados and they know how to use sweet potatoes. The difference is in her recipe-- she uses coconut milk (which can be found in a can in most grocery stores in the \"ethnic\" section instead of milk and we add about a cup of raisins which have been soaking for several weeks in rum! If you don't have that much time, soaking them in rum overnight will work, too! Instead of lemon juice we use lime juice plus using the zest of half of the lime right in the mix. The lime juice gives it a real Caribbean taste.  I will substitute all spice or pumpkin spice for the ginger, cloves and cinnamon.  This dish sure beats the boring sweet potatoes and marshmallow dish seen in most American homes. Give it a try for something special and different.",

                "reviewBody": "My Grandma use to make the best sweet potato pudding that was sooo delicious. She grated the potatoes by hand. It was authentic old school, country cooking. I wanted to recreate her potato pudding for Thanksgiving, so I gave this recipe a shot.  It turned out great after making some modifications.  So the biggest change was I used four-9 oz bags of Bird's Eye frozen sweet potatoes, seasoned with brown sugar.  I used frozen potatoes for 3 reasons.  (1) The frozen potatoes had no artificial flavors or colors  (2) The frozen potatoes were similar to grated potatoes in texture once blended and (3) All of the canned potatoes I found were in a syrup.  Because the potatoes I used were already lightly seasoned, I used 2/3 cups sugar instead of 1 cup.  I added Daily Bread flour to mixture (about 1/8 cup).  The flour worked as a binder and I used Daily Bread because that was the brand my Grandma used.  Because I used frozen potatoes, I cooked the potato pudding for  2 hours instead of 30 minutes, stirring the mixture every 40 minutes. It turned out perfect and my Stepdad basically ate the whole pan in 2 days (me and my Mom only got ONE small serving a piece SMH).  My Mom told me on a scale of 1-10 (with a 10 being my Grandma's pudding), I came in at 7 LOL.   I'll take that any day :-).  I'm making myself a smaller pan today to go with my dinner for the week.  This was a fun recipe to play with.",
