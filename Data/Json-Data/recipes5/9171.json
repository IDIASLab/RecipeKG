This recipe is inexpensive and tastes delicious. The only problem I had is getting the cream cheese to completely smooth. There were little lumps left and they didn't bake out- they were still there when the pie had cooled. Next time I will have to smoothen the mixture more. And the recipe calls for 1 pie shell, this mixture made 1 9\" pie, 3 mini 1\" pies and I had a lot left over. Better get 2-3 pie shells for this one.",
