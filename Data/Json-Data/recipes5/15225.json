        "description": "Falafel is one of the most popular foods in Egypt. It's made out of peeled beans and always served fried. It's also made in the Levant area (mainly Syria and Lebanon) using chickpeas. In my recipe, I used red lentils and replaced the traditional cooking method (frying) with baking. Using lentils instead of beans to create an innovative recipe has been quite satisfying.",

It's best eaten with a fork because it remains a bit soft and pliable. I served half of the flatbread with the yogurt sauce and toppings on the side. Definitely an incomparable addition to your table and definitely guest-worthy. Thank you for the recipe.",
