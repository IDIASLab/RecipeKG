My neighbor gave it to me and I was not too thrilled with the way he told me to cook it so I searched for other recipes. We finished almost all that I cooked. I did find that it was rather labor intensive though. It took longer than the recipe said it would but was worth the effort. It had an excellent flavor and was ultra-tender. I did use less black pepper and it was plenty spicy enough. I do not think it would have been way to spicy otherwise. Can hardly wait to cook it again! I look forward to trying the venison roast recipes that I found also. Thanks for the great recipe!",
