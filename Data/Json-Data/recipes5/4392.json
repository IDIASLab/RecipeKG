And in this case you were to cook the beans along with the already cooked jalapeno and shallots which just didn't appeal to me. So...I cooked the vegetables first adding more jalapeno than called for and some chopped red pepper as well (mainly because I'm on the road again in the morning and wanted to make use of what I had in the fridge). Meantime I cooked the green beans in boiling salted water for five minutes then immediately shocked them in an ice water bath. This made quick work of finishing them up in the fry pan with the sweated vegetables once I was about ready to serve with little chance of over or undercooking them - this method also kept them a bright and vibrant green. The lemon at the end lent a fresh flavor and brought out just the right hint of tanginess. No worries about there being too much heat in the jalapenos since you're not using the seeds or membranes. Never would have thought to use jalapenos in green beans - it was an interesting and flavorful addition.",
