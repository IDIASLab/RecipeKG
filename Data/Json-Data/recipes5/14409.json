I added the onion, carrot, and celery, (which I increased the amounts of to about 1c each,) threw in the garlic once the veggies were almost done. I deglazed the pan with water, chicken Better than Bullion, added about 2 Tbs sazonador, (found in the Mexican food aisle.) I then put the cabbage in, seasoned with more salt and pepper and a few more splashes of sazonador, threw the lid on for about 5 minutes to let it get tender, removed the lid to reduce the liquid and stirred til nearly done. THEN, (and this is good!!) I returned the bacon, topped the whole thing with two tubes of refrigerated biscuits, and baked it at 400 for 15-20 mins til they were a nice light brown. It was AMAZING!!! Oh!! And the apple!! I used a Granny Smith- diced 1/2 and cooked it with the veggies, thinly sliced the other 1/2 and added it with the cabbage!",

Just wasn't so great.\" We couldn't nail down what it was about this casserole that didn't sit well w/ us. We love the combination of any type of sausage w/ cabbage not to mention bacon too! The only small alterations that I had to make were less celery (didn't have 2 c. worth which really seemed like way too much!) I used a bag of shredded cabbage/carrot \"coleslaw mix\" and Vidalia onion instead of white. 2 TB of Italian seasoning and the 2 tsp of coriander was over-kill. Simply the bacon S&P and garlic would've made us enjoy this much more I think.",
