Don\u2019t know why this is called \u201cSicilian\u201d roasted chicken because paprika is not a spice that is really used in Sicily or any part of Italy for that matter. More like \u201cHungarian\u201d chicken. I make a similar dish to this without the paprika, but add granulated garlic, onion powder, dried oregano & rosemary, or some already mixed dried Italian seasoning. First step is to  dry the chicken pieces off with paper towels before adding seasonings so it browns up nicely and has a crispy skin. If using all breasts, give them a light brushing with olive oil first. This helps to keep the meat moister.  Then just lay it out on a sheet pan and roast for about 35-45 min at  400\u00b0, depending on what kind of oven you have. Mine is convection so takes less time. Easy and delicious.",
