Also, when I don't have mini-muffin liners I use fat-free cooking spray on the bottoms of the muffin tins and they come out excellent.  \r\n\r\nThe only bad thing about these walnut cups is that they disappear in a matter of minutes!",

I didn't have muffin liners so I just sprayed them with baking cooking spray and then floured them. I actually had some leftover crust (which I really liked) and my mom made some savory filling (ham and cheese held together by one yolk) and they turned out like great appetizers! I also filed one with blueberries and those were very good too! Great recipe thanks!",
