Added a little more bacon grease to skillet turned up heat and browned goose slices on both sides but not cooked through. In large crock pot layered bottom with peeled small-medium potatoes then browned meat bacon-onion mix (next time I'll insert a layer of apple slices here) and topped with 2 quarts kraut.
