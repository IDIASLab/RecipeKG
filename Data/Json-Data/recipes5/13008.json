It was hard for me to keep from giving the recipe four stars but the taste isn't quite to four star level. The taste is a little better than average and because the recipe works and offers flexibility it something I will consider making again. Not wishing to run to the store I substituted with what I had on hand: 1) ziti for rigatoni 2) mayo for sour cream (this works great I've done it many times especially in casseroles and 3) dried parmesan cheese for fresh. I also added two small cans of mushrooms and a small amount of leftover frozen white corn. With the extra dry ingredients I also threw in a can of cream of chicken soup to cover the dry ingredients. Because my casserole dish was larger than what was called for in the recipe it accommodated the extra ingredients perfectly. Bravo!",

I used almost 24 ounces of pasta two cans of condensed soup (one chicken and one mushroom) 1 cup of low-fat sour cream and a variety of frozen mixed vegetables and it was wonderful! With the two soups and extra sour cream it was creamy and not dry at all. I also used one large boiled chicken breast which I thought was just enough. This is something I will make again and again. Also very good as leftovers!",

I had no onion powder so I used some chopped frozen onions I had in the freezer. I also had no frozen peas so I used frozen mixed veggies. I don't think the changes I had to make would have made a huge difference in the taste. I thought it was a little strong on the garlic and very dry. It needed more sauce. No one really liked it because it was dry. I'll try it again but add another can of mushroom soup and some more sour cream to it. It was easy to make and on a busy day that was a plus!",
