The only thing I'd change is I'd use more cilantro. I think this would be good with black olives and fresh tomatoes in addition to the sundried. Oh and it was very easy to prepare--bonus!",

We also bring the canned beans to a boil as my daughter spent time in Spain and grew to like the softer beans served there. Boiling the beans makes removing the husk easier if you're going for presentation too. Have made several times. Ideas from other raters that worked well were adding olives using roma tomatoes instead of sundried and I always add more beans. (I usually boil two cans because I snack on them when I remove the husks and some are smooshed or break in half.) Can't go wrong with a feta/onion/garlic/cilantro combo!",

So, I add a large handful of chopped and pitted calamata olives, celery for awesome crunch, roma tomatoes, like some of the other ladies suggested and I use a balsamic vinagrette along with a drizzle of  olive oil for a fresh finish. I also add chopped fresh parsley. It keeps well for weeks and seems to get better as it marinates. I use organic, canned garbonzoes because I find the flavor and texture far and above surpasses the non-organic variety.",
