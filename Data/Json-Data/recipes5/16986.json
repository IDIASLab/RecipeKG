I used the amt. of butter the recipe called for.\n\nFor the apple mixture, I sprinkled w/ nutmeg, cinnamon and a bit of allspice! With the water (about 1 C. I think), I added 4 T caramel ice cream topping and 1 egg. No added sugar.\n\nIt wasn't too sweet and we even had it for a late, special breakfast (the kids are still talking about our \"special breakfast!\")\n\nThanks for my new favorite!

If you add nutmeg on its own, just a pinch or two is fine.  If you like your topping with the oatmeal in it like I do, also add about 2 Tbsp. more butter to make up for the extra dry ingredient in the topping.  The apples bake down, so if you like a thicker layer of apples, use one or two more.  Using yellow cake mix also works just the same as white.  My whole family LOVES this recipe.  You will too.",

I used a spice cake mix instead of white, I omitted the brown sugar and added 2 packets of Quaker Instant Oatmeal Supreme cinnamon pecan cereal (make sure to get the supreme cereal only because of denser oats than regular)to the cake mix along with 1 tsp cinnamon. For the apples, I added 4 TBL caramel Ice cream topping blended with the 1 cup water and 1 egg. This was poured over the apples.

                "reviewBody": "Well I couldn't find the recipe I usually use so looked for one to make Hubby something with apples. He was suggesting one that used the cake mix topping. I found this one and tried it right to the recipe except I added a little oatmeal to the topping for extra flavor. I was not really happy with it and won't make this one again. It was so sweet it made the roof of my mouth itch! Cut the brown sugar IN HALF and it might be a lot better. I used granny smiths too so it wasn't sweet apples/sweet sugar situation. The topping got too hard as well. I attributed some of that to my adding some oatmeal but still... it wasn't what I was after at all and way way too sweet as written.",
