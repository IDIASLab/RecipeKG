I also used a masher on the potatoes then whipped them & the other ingredients with my mixer because I like my mashed potatoes creamy!  I used evaporated milk in place of the half-&-half (a little more than 1/4 cup), about 1/4 t black pepper, and between 1-2 t salt.  I also added about 2 t butter extract so they were more buttery flavored without the added fat/calories.  Next time I'm going to try fat free evaporated milk to make them even healthier!",

Be careful not to get overzealous with the lemon juice - if you put too much in it definitely overpowers and ruins the dish. But it does add a nice touch so I advise that you not omit it completely. Otherwise it's open to variation...i've done it with or without the half and half with roasted garlic green onions etc. All quite yum.",
