Granted it was a bit more dense than cake more like bread or pound cake consistency but it still received rave reviews. It was moist and flavorful. I made a crumble for the top out of butter mixed spices oats shredded coconut and brown sugar. It complimented the cake really well and added a nice contrasting texture. I find it difficult to find good recipes with true carribean flavors but this one is excellent.",

The flavor of banana is prominent but the rum coconut and pineapple flavors are all but lost in that of sugar. I was also disappointed that the yield was totally off. One recipe made 21 good-sized muffins not 12. I realize the given yield can only be an approximation but this wasn't even close. I didn't need that many. I wasn't prepared for that many. The recipe was good...in theory. The real thing will be tossed.",

I used slightly less brown sugar than called for (and may alter it next time to use honey or agave instead as I prefer not to eat 'sugar' anyone have any suggestions on making the modification???) and used canned tidbit pineapple chopped into bits. Mmmmmmmm. These were very tropically and moist. I didn't taste too much of the coconut sadly so next time I may omit the flaked coconut altogether and add 1/2 rum extract and 1/2 coconut extract instead. My husband is 'not a muffin fan' which he told me today after ten years of couplehood ha ha and he thought they were not moist enough. I told him I don't care that I'll be making these often for myself. Today in fact because I have some pineapple left over!:) Don't worry I'll still find something to bake for him...but I'm glad I get these all to myself!",

I did change a couple of things: I dont like shredded coconut much so I omitted it except for using a little as a garnish on the tops. Instead I substituted the rum flavoring(also something I dont care for) for an equal amount of coconut extract. I also substituted the same amount of puree'd canned pinapple for the dried. They came out heavenly. Next time I make them I will increase the bananas to four as I think it would make them even more moist and dense. Also I didnt have butter on hand the first time so I used margarine which I WOULD NOT recommend doing-I was lucky they still came out despite that mess!",
