I'm the sort of person who will salt something before I've even tried it because I know it won't be salty enough and I found these too salty. With the recipe's ratios the orange juice and other spices are completely masked by an overwhelming taste of soy. I would suggest swapping the two ratios putting two cups of orange juice in for every cup of soy sauce and maybe adding some brown sugar or honey.",
