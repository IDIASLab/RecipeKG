Cut about an inch diamond pattern over the outside approximately 1/4 inch deep, place a clove in the center of each diamond.  Insert a cherry on a toothpick and insert that into the ham and add a pineapple ring - do this over the entire ham. No water, just placed the ham cut side down in a foil lined 9 x 13 baking dish and cooked at 325 for about 1 1/2 hours.  Mix the rest of the ingredients along with the drained pineapple juice and cook in the microwave for 3-5 minutes untill thickened.  Use the mixture to baste the ham every 15 to 20 minutes for the next 1 1/2 hours.",

While baking the ham as directed, I prepared the glaze over low heat in a sauce pan, with a tad of the pineapple and cherry juice stirred in. When the ham was done I cut it into slices/pieces and placed them in a crock pot.  I then mixed a little of the ham (water) juices from the baking pan in with the glaze to make it a little thinner.  I poured the glaze over the ham slices and added the pineapple chunks and cherries and stirred to mix it all up.  I got lots of compliments, and the ham was so moist cooked this way!  LOVED IT!",

My mom suggested buying the already cooked ham cubes and mixing it in with mac and cheese. I was bound and determined to make him a ham with all the fixins. This one was the first one I came across that looked good to me so I tried it. I followed the directions to a tee. The only thing I did differently was placed the ham directly in the pan (no rack as I didn't have one) with the water right in it like stated. Three hours later it was dinner time and I was stressing. I had no back up plan and my whole family was hungry. This was the most amazing ham I had ever eaten in all of my existance. I had so many compliments. Thank you so much for posting this. This recipe is so fool-proof its unreal. I felt no need to make any changes to the recipe. I will definitely make this again. Who knows maybe I'll confidently take on Easter dinner this year. Thanks again!",

Additionally much of the baste burned onto the ham which made those outside pieces inedible and overall while it probably reduced some of the saltiness this did not really flavor the ham well. I did however enjoy eating the pineapples.",
