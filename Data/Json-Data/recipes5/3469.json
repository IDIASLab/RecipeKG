                "reviewBody": "Why have boring old turkey salad when you can have this?!?! What a great twist on the usual turkey salad. Your family will thank you and your guests will be impressed! I made the recipe exactly as written. The only change I might suggest is to use more chutney in the dressing for added flavor. Next time instead of oranges I might try diced mango. TIP: If you're not going to be eating this soon after making do NOT use fresh pineapple. Use canned instead. The bromelain enzyme in fresh pineapple (which is destroyed in canning process and not an issue with canned pineapple) will give the chicken an unpleasant texture. The meat breaks down and gets a mushy/gritty texture. Just a heads up for people who aren't aware of this! I served this on it's own over lettuce leaves and also inside a low-carb wrap. Fabulous both ways!",

I added toasted almond slivers and some dried cranberries. I served it over lettuce and put some avacado on the side. I think it is probably very low fat but tastes very satisfying. I am taking it to a ladies luncheon potluck. I think it will be well received.",
