What a mess! The only thing I wasn't sure of was the bacon, was I supposed add the diced bacon precooked to the olive oil? I sauteed it before including the olive oil. Emptied the bacon grease, added the onions and followed the rest of the recipe and everything went well till the submerged blender where the damned fibers kept clogging up the works. Somehow I was supposed to know this already per my girlfriend. Who said \u201dcommon sense\u201d grrr! Anyway, the extra time it took straining the fibers through a colander really thinned it up but, still quite tasty. My girlfriend has had three servings so, I guess I'm not such a numbnuts after all.",
