I knew it would be before I even added the powdered sugar and thought to myself that I'd like to pour some of that caramel sauce over ice cream or a piece of apple pie or apple cake.  But I needed it for my \"Spice Cupcakes,\" so I restrained myself.  Submitter said you may need to add more milk - in my case, since I piped rather than spread the frosting, I had to add a tad more powdered sugar.  It's easy enough to adjust one way or the other to suit your needs.  This is a smooth, silky, caramel-y good frosting.  Sweet, yes, as frosting is supposed to be, and perfect with the spice cupcakes which were only mildly sweet.  It's a gorgeous looking frosting too and made my cupcakes almost look regal.  Most important, it TASTES good.  Tastes good, looks good - at the risk of being cliche, \"it's a keeper.\"",

You need to be sure that the brown sugar and butter come to a rolling boil before timing and also a rolling boil again after adding milk.  Also, pour the caramel into your mixing bowl and then add the powdered sugar.  Don't vigourously scrape the saucepan.  If you do all this, you should get smooth results.",
