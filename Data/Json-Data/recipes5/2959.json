Made a few small changes though: only added 1 clove of garlic, reduced lemon juice to 2 tablespoons, subbed in 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil for the tahini (I had none), and used chickpeas in place of the garbonzo beans. After that there was no reason to season with salt and pepper because it was perfect. Great recipe!",

I put it in sammies with kalamata olives chopped fresh red pepper chopped cucumber feta cheese with lemon juice olive oil and balsamic vinegar sprinkled on top. One problem with the instructions: the intro says bring to room temp before serving but the directions say to chill until ready to serve. Maybe you are supposed to keep your house very cold?:)",
