Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Makes many servings and is excellent the next day. Should the soup become too thick it may be thinned with broth. Have many Chicago hard rolls, red wine, baguettes or garlic bread on hand. BUON APPETITO!",

I took just a little liberty with the recipe, using fresh minced garlic, tomato sauce from my garden, a \"glug\" of a good red wine, and fresh parsley. I used the amount of herbs as the recipe directed, even though I thought it might be too much, but it all came together perfectly. Topped this with a little shredded mozarella and served it with garlic bread. This Italian gal cleaned her bowl! As for hubby?  The first words out of his mouth (filled with pasta e fagioli) were, \"Make this again!\"",

Unfortunately Ivan passed away just over two years ago.  \r\nHe had many recipe's. This one was among  his favorites. Most people who have had it agree it is an excellent Italian soup. We have served Pasta e Fagioli a la Chez Ivano (he really liked that name) numerous times to guests, and they always ask for the recipe before they leave. \r\nPeople will try variations to satisfy there own tastes but the basis of this recipe remains Ivan's. \r\nPerhaps one day I will get his recipe book out and share more with you. \r\nThere is a recipe for S.O.S. that I'm sure most who have been in the military would appreciate.",

I have cooked this both the regular way and by slow cooker, and have had great success for both.  For slow-cooker fans:  scramble-fry ground beef, then add all ingredients to crock-pot except for kidney beans and pasta.  Cook for 4-6 hours on high (or 8-10 on low, your preference).  Add the kidney beans and pasta during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  If you intend to keep/freeze leftovers, cook the pasta separately and add it to each soup bowl... this will prevent liquid absorption and smushy pasta.  I found that macaroni also works well if you can't find ditalini in your grocery store. I reduced the amount of garlic to 5-6 large cloves, minced (for a 10-serving recipe), and we did not lack for garlic flavour! Thanks so much for a first-class recipe, Ivan!",

The 105 year old husband said one of the things he appreciated about her was that she prepared dinners for him including his beloved pasta e fagioli. LOL I thought if pasta e fagioli could keep a couple together for 82 years I'd better try it too!;) This recipe was good. Better the next day for sure but I think I'd use regular beef broth next time as the flavor was quite a bit too strong for our tastes. The main idea was good tho. I halved the recipe add julliened carrot (1 cup for the half recipe) fresh garlic (4 large cloves for the half recipe) and fresh parsley (didn't have dried). The rest I followed exactly. PS Serve with garlic or cheese bread and an italian salad.",
