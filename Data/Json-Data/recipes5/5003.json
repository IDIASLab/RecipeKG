I used fresh lemons and squeezed them.  I also used garlic salt instead of sea salt.  Oh, I used instant potatoes to thicken the soup to my tastes.  I am a FAN FOR LIFE! yum!  Oh, and the bread I coated with butter and garlic salt and put on the top rack of my oven to toast.  Next time I am going to add chicken.  I think chicken would finish this recipie nicely.",

I made a few changes: I diced half of a small red onion and sauteed in butter before step 1. I replaced the terragon with thai basil and the half and half with hemp milk because that was all I had. Turned out great though. I would give it 5 stars but even with the addition of the onion it was just a bit bland for my taste. Next time I will add celery in with the onion and maybe a tiny bit of either jalapeno or cayenne pepper.",

My changes: no half and half used full fat plain yogurt instead i no zucchini but had broccoli shreds instead 1 whole yellow onion sauteed in butter combination of veggie stock and chicken stock dried tarragon instead of fresh.using the cheese as garnish rather than in the body of the soup So with those changes it was delish. I pureed most of the veggies left some of them a bit chunky for some mouth feel. I am tempted to use the instant potato flakes like one other reviewer suggested as I added too much yogurt and it came out a bit runny.. but maybe I'll just do that for half. I did not add garlic as I usually would as this stayed lighter and fresher with just the tarragon. I will make this again!!",
