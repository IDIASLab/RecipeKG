Everything starts coming together nicely all pretty fluffy bright white green and then BAM the splash of black vinegar and the spicy mustard gets added. At that point the salad turns a color that is not very appetizing. I can't know for sure but I honestly think it was the fault of the vinegar so I would suggest using a white balsamic vinegar instead of the dark one that I used. I think that will fix the appearance. Again this tasted great and I really liked the addition of chili powder.",
