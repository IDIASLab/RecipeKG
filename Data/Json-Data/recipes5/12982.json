I think I was the only one who had more than one taste; I had to have two or three crackers of the stuff just trying to figure out why it was rated so highly. I was very disappointed because this recipe had so many rave reviews. It was salty and the ranch taste was overpowering. In fact no one could tell that there was chicken in it. It was simple to make and the ingredients are easy to keep on hand so I guess it might be a good recipe to have for emergencies.",
