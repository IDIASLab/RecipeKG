                "reviewBody": "I made these for recipe group 12/04/2011. These were a cute little cookie. The full recipe yielded 21 cookies using a leveled cookie scoop. I found out from a lady on the recipe buzz that this cookie was actually a Pillsbury recipe contest winner from 1952 by the same name. The recipes really are exactly the same, except the icing is a tad different. I did not have unsweetened chocolate so I used the icing from the original recipe calling for semi-sweet chocolate and adding 1/2 cup extra of powdered sugar to thicken it. It was a little sweet, so I would stick with the icing recipe here. However, the cookie has just a nice light sweetness, like a shortbread, which I liked. The same lady suggested covering the pecans well to avoid them from burning. After I scooped the cookie on I pressed down slightly, to shape, and then pushed the pecans in a little further. The cookies don't spread too much, and it worked well. Make sure to save the egg white from the second egg. The Pillsbury recipe indicates the one egg should be separated in the ingredients list. I also used 105 pecan halves. The original recipe does state 1 full cup. The cookie looks just like the picture and refridgeration sets the chocolate icing nicely. Despite little recipe quirks, that deviate from the original, I enjoyed making these and were surprised how nicely they turned out. Kids would really love these!",

Not sure if it added much but they did taste great. For the icing I did as this recipe indicated except used only 6 tblsp of milk. I didn't need to add more than 1 cup icing sugar it was a perfect consistency and had a really nice sweet dark chocolate taste.",
