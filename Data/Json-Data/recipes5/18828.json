Based on the review, I also reduce the water, to make sure that the sauce is not too watery. \n\nI also did not poach the fish in advance, because salmon usually cooks very fast in the oven. \n\nThe taste is awesome. It gives a perfect balance. I love this recipe and would definitely make it again.",

The only change I made was I didn't have prepared soy-ginger dressing, so I mashed up some sushi ginger in 3tbsp of soy sauce.  It was great!  The only thing I'll do different next time is not poach the salmon beforehand.  Salmon cooks quickly enough in the oven without the added step of poaching.  A keeper for sure!",

Instead of the salad dressing I used a generous splash of light soy, fresh ground ginger, garlic, some mirin instead of sake, a bit of rice wine vineager and a squeeze of lime.  I used maybe a quarter cup of miso since it seemed like it would be too salty with more.  I also used honey instead of brown sugar.  Took half of the ingredients mixed for a marinade, then added the rest to sauteed onions, baby garlic, scallions, snow peas and wheat pasta as a sauce.  Overall a little salty but very tasty.",

I would also either add more Sake or ignore it all together the amount in the recipe isn't noticeable. Also I have no idea where to find soy-ginger salad dressing. It wasn't at the specialty store it wasn't at the grocery store So I just added 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1 tsp fresh ginger. I'll try it again with these changes.",

I found that the sauce was too runny to be a spread but a bit too thick to be a good glaze - it might have been the salad dressing I used (Jesse's Ginger Salad Dressing on this site - I kept the carrots which added nice flavour) or maybe next time I won't add the water so I can get a thicker spread of the sauce on the salmon. I served the salmon with cous cous with carrots and currents and with steamed broccoli over which I poured some extra sauce from the pan - delish! I am definitely going to try it out on chicken and maybe beef too!",
