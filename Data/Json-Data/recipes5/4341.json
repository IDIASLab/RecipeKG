We like our veggies crunchy so I undercook a little bit and then quickly rinse with cold water.  I sauteed the garlic in the olive oil.  I threw the green beans in a bowl poured garlic and oil over the whole thing and squeezed 1/2 of a fresh lemon and tossed again.  Added a tiny bit of salt and it was great.  I think 1/4 cup of oil is too much.  2 tablespoons is more than  enough.  Follow your common sense when cooking and you'll never go wrong. Thanks for sharing. ",
