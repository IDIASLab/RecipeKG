This is an unusual and creative twist on vanilla ice cream that really works. Great recipe!",

I made just a few changes, which was to cut back on the cream by one cup and replace it with whole milk (cut back on some of the fat.) Just before adding everything to the ice cream maker \nI whipped it with an electric mixer to \"fluff\" it up. I also cut back on the sugar by a little more than 1/4 cup but increased the honey by 2-3 tablespoons (I love honey.) The result was a very creamy - and honey tasting - ice cream.  Topped with some granola it made a great treat.  I will make this one again and again.",

Ice cream was determined to the what the contest would be based on.  I saw this recipe and decided that I would use it because I decided that the less complex the recipe the better.  Needless to say,  I  won the contest by the votes of multitudes of people at the celebration.  I doubled the recipe to fit my ice cream maker.  It had a very rich vanilla flavor and the combination of honey and brown sugar added a deeper dimension of sweetness to it.  Almost caramel-like.  It had a really smooth creamy texture that was unlike any of the other contestants.  It was almost fluffy.  Thank you for the recipe.  I will be using it again.",

This recipe looked better than the one in the KitchenAid booklet so I decided to try it. It turned out very rich sweet and buttery tasting and reminded me somewhat of butter pecan flavor. I didn't have a thermometer to measure the temperature while cooking and wasn't sure how \"thick\" the egg/milk mixture was supposed to get. I cooked the mixture about 10-15 minutes and it became quite frothy on the top so I thought it must be done at that point. It wasn't what I would call \"thick\" but it did seem like the texture was slightly different than when it started. I tried another Honey Vanilla recipe since making this one and it didn't have sugar but a lot more honey (3/4 cup). It didn't turn out as tasty as this recipe so I imagine this one is hard to beat! The only downside is how fattening it is....which I wouldn't worry about when making for a party/other guests but for just us at home will have to make lower fat gelato & sorbet recipes so we don't balloon up!",

But what I got was an ice cream turned out so creamy and delicious with a subtle honey taste while you indulge but the honey taste really kicks in afterwards. What a wonderful way to enjoy each bite of your ice cream! I knew this ice cream would turn out creamy when it said to strain the custard. This technique is usually used in a gelato recipe that I absolutely love! Always turns out smooth and extra creamy! I used vanilla extract since I didn't have vanilla beans on hand and there was a very small \"bite\" of \"too much sweetness\" in the ice cream but nothing too noticeable. I think reducing the sugar just a smidgen would work fine. Otherwise if you want an alternative to plain vanilla...This Is It!",

I made it today to have for serving on top of Thanksgiving pies and it's so unbelievably delicious that it's a major temptation. The marriage of honey and vanilla is sheer genius! The honey is just barely discernible but it complements the vanilla flavor to perfection. I didn't have any whole milk so I substituted fat-free half and half. No matter. The texture is wonderful the flavor sublime. It melts in a silken ribbon on the tongue leaving a delightful taste on the palate that makes you crave another spoonful. I cut back on the brown sugar by 25% after reading several reviews that noted excessive sweetness. After tasting the solution it was just a bit short of sweetness so I simply added about 2 Tb Splenda to make it just right. Awesome!",
