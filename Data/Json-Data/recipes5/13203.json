I cut the quinoa down to 1 cup. Then I cut the whole recipe in half so it made two servings. On the first night I made it cold following the recipe. It was zesty and filling. On the second night I sauteed all of the vegetables and heated up the beans and leftover quinoa. I layered it all together with the cold cilantro sauce which warmed up nicely. I loved it both ways! Very tangy! If you don't like any heat at all maybe leave out the jalapeno pepper or at least the seeds. I'll make this again. Very easy!",
