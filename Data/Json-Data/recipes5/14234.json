We had it for dinner with a green salad. So easy to make (used leftover easter eggs prepped it in the morning refrigerated all day then added the buttered bread and cooked it that evening). Unfortunately my husband does not like the texture of onions so I had to skip them but I added a generous helping of onion powder to the soup/seasoning mixture. I don't have seasoned salt so in addition to the salt I added a few shakes of paprika pepper and cumin. When I first glanced at the ingredients I thought this would end up tasting like a deviled egg casserole but it just tastes like eggs and rye toast with a chicken/dill sauce! It's not anything grand but it is so simple and so yummy.",
