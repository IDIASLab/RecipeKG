I used lard and I was a little more generous with the amount than Chef John's recipe. I suggest our favorite salad/relish to accompany this. Sliced carrots, thinly sliced onion, finely chopped jalapeno, and chopped cucumber and cilantro in an equal part of vinegar, water and sugar. The bright flavor offsets this beautifully! The only thing I would warn is that Chef John was not exaggerating when he advised a large pot. I used an 8 quart dutch oven and I had an unholy mess on my stove top.  Use a BIG POT!! Thanks for another delish recipe Chef John!",

Because I want to not waste the gravy I have decided to put it over a bed of rice and eat the meat on top. I also scooped off some of the gravy and grease and used it on some iron skillet shaved brussels sprouts.

But I did take the advice of some one else who reviewed it and made a sauce out of the leftover juices adding a couple of canned  chipotle chilis and a tablespoon of  corn starch to thicken. I simmered it all together for about ten minute and then I put it all in the blender. I got compliments about the carnitas and raves about the sauce.

In the video he says any size is fine as long as they are all the same. I did mine probably 3x3 but it was a little big I think.\n\n2. The milk does turn into strange little dots. I tried some (I know, weird) because I was trying to take them out. They are creamy little things, like ricotta (this is actually how you make ricotta!). After baking, they dissappear. Don't worry about them! They probably help it crisp. \n\n3. Oh geez... I can't remember. This is all lovely. Don't throw away the sauce it's made in, it is so good.\n\nJust make this!
