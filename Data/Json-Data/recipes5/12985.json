I used an artisian rye bread and after tossing the bread along with the onions in the melted butter transferred it all to a 9x13 and baked it for about 12 minutes. The spices I added to doctor it up a bit were: 1-1 1/2 tsp garlic powder a pinch of cayenne pepper a pinch of Durkee Grill Creations Kansas City Style Chicken Seasoning. I also didn't have a full cup of shredded cheddar so I used a mixture of cheddar swiss a small block of Velveeta I had left over and some pepper jack (again thinking that would spice things up a bit). It smelled good and looked good but was just so so at best. Will likely not make again.",
