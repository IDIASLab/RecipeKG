My husband's family are of German descent and his family's staple diet was American German-based...including 100 ways to cook cabbage. His parents have passed I wanted to bring back some of his old comfort foods. Deciding to start with cabbage I chose this recipe because well BACON. He really liked it. I have a hard time rating it personally because I'm not quite to the point of liking the taste of cabbage. I added red pepper flakes to bump up the flavor. I cooked the cabbage in the bacon grease and in the future will probably decrease the amount because the cabbage tended to be a little greasy. Other than that he was really happy with the dish and I'm happy to give him something that tastes like childhood.",

I did not use the pepper flakes as I ma intolerant to them. Also, I had savoy cabbage at the time so I used it. OMG! Talking about trying something good! This will be included in my rotation. Personally, I think this recipe has enough grease from the bacon to cook it. However, depending on the volume of your cabbage, you may need to add the olive oil. Will absolutely make it again!!!",
