The only substitution I made was because I couldn't find sherry vinegar in either of two grocery stores. Per Internet recommendations I used rice wine vinegar as a substitute. This was my only deviation from the recipe. It was delicious. Cool refreshing and mellow compared to its tomato based siblings. It was even tastier on day 2. Maybe my cukes were extra juicy but I thought adding 1.5 cups of water was a little much. I suggest adding that \"to taste\". 1 cup would have been sufficient. Straining the soup produced a more refined texture but is unnecessisarily fussy and just makes more dishes. Don't bother. Creme fraiche is a little spendy. Plain yogurt would probably be great.",

I don't have a blender so had to use what I have (a mini chopper) which made it quite fussy since I had to blend many batches. There was also a lot of \"stuff\" when I strained the gazpacho - probably because of not having a good blender. Next time I'll probably leave the bread out or cut way back on it.

Just noting for those who wondered the bread is pureed and then strained as a thickener (and add some subtle flavor) to the soup. Even though it may seem like there is no point since you strain it out bread as a thickener is a great traditional method that adds a richer more velvety mouth to the dish. I suspect it might be a little watery without it (but I've been wrong before:)",
