Before making it I though maybe the brown sugar, cola, pineapple juice, and grape juice would end up making the ham too sweet. I couldn't have been more wrong. The sweetness complimented the saltiness of the ham perfectly. I'll definitely be making this again in the future. Thanks for the great recipe. ",

Drain cola and add pineapple with juice and rub ham with brown sugar. I only added 1/2 the sugar. The cola is used to tenderize the ham and Boy did it!!!Delicious!!!

My guests could not believe the sauce was Coke and grape juice. After I put the brown sugar on the ham I wrapped it in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator for about an hour.

The butt ham was ok but that was not because of this topping it was because a butt ham is definitely not as good as a pit ham! Made this for Christmas and EVERYONE loved it and said it was the best ham they had ever had. If you concentrate on the flavors you will probably taste the grape juice but if you taste it without that in mind the flavors meld very well and make this ham well worth the effort. I made this in my Nesco at the same temp as the recipe states for the oven. It was done in about an hour maybe an hour and a half. Will definitely make again!",
