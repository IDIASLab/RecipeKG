It instructions are simple, the sauce with its dash of mustard and lemon had a nice slight \"tang\".  It was also thick enough to bind the fish nicely together, making a definite bottom layer to the pie.  Baking the potatoes instead of boiling them  before mashing them was a new technique for me but one I will now use frequently (I did bake mine in the microwave which saved a lot of time).\nThe result a tasty browned topping on a succulent fish base.  \nNOTE: this IS a potato topped pie similar to Shepherds Pie, do not expect a separate crust like most american pies.",

I used cod as the white fish, and for the medium cheddar, I ended up using the bits and bobs of shredded cheese we had in the freezer. which included some sharp cheddar.

The taste was ok but the texture was so unappealing that I couldn't even bring myself to eat the leftovers. When plated it looks like a big mound of mashed potatoes but every other bite you get a piece of hidden fish or shrimp that just throws you off. Again the flavor was fine if you can get over the texture or lack there of. I almost think it would be better if you put the potato layer down first and baked it to form a \"crust\" and then later added the shrimp and sauce? I don't know but it is just a thought. I will not be attempting this one again...sorry",
