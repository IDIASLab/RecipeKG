The whole family loved including my parents and my two year old. I dut down on the salsa and cayenne pepper a tad since my mom doesn't like spicy but otherwise went by her instructions. I chopped up the chicken and sauteed it in a skillet on the stove with about a TBSP. of veg. oil. We julienned some carrots tossed those in with the chicken also. While the chicken was cooking I made the sauce but left out the salt as she had recommended. When my chicken was done I just added the sauce to the chicken and warmed it and added some bean sprouts. We cooked some spinach fettucine and tossed that with it and it was done. An easy thirty minute meal that was healthy and not your typical dish. We will definitely make this again.",
