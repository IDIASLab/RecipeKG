I did use three cloves of garlic. We always use bone-in pork chops when possible because the flavor is so much richer than just the boneless! One last thought is that I grilled only three pork chops and to do four would mean that the marinade would be pretty sparse. In this case I would not necessarily make more---rather take a little more than 1/2 cup out for the marinade and turn them in the bag a little more frequently. I did not use all the reserved marinade when BBQing the chops. This was excellent and I will definitely make this again!",
