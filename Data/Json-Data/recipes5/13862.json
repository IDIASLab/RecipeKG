I am no stranger when it comes to making egg rolls and the only thing I can figure where it went wrong was in the cabbage and the canned bean sprouts. I typically buy the already shredded bagged cabbage and the shred on that is super fine. I had a half a head of cabbage to use up and my shred wasn't nearly as fine resulting in the cabbage releasing a lot of liquid while it cooked. I drained and rinsed the canned bean sprouts but they still held a lot of liquid as well. Fresh would have worked better. Halfway through this recipe I could see this wasn't going to work so I stuck the rest of the eggrolls in the freezer for a couple of days and forgot about them. I deep fried them from their frozen state last night and that did work better but they still didn't get the crisp on them like they should have. Bottom line is that the filling is way too wet. If you are going to make as written, I recommend draining the filling in a colander prior to putting in the wrappers. The dipping sauce was good as written.",
