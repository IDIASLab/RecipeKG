Of course, there is no bread or cheese in this, but with the rainbow of colors and flavors, I didn't really miss them.  I only changed the greens, subbing in fresh spinach for the kale, because that is what I had on hand.  I don't believe that changed the outcome of this solid recipe.  I had one serving for breakfast, wrapped up a serving to take to work for lunch, then froze the rest.  We shall see what happens after some time in the freezer.  I like sweet potato, but in this recipe, i willto season adequately to balance the sweet flavor and make it more savory, next time.  Thanks for the idea!",

It  called for 3 llbs of sausage meat which I used, but if I make it again I will cut this back as I find that 3 llbs is way too much meat. I used a mixture of sweet potato & yams & I used fresh spinach instead of kale. Otherwise I followed the recipie as stated.  While it's tasty I do feel it needs some other seasoning to give it some zip. but a nice change from the bread or hashbrown breakfast dishes.",

I also ended up throwing in the kitchen sink all the veg indicated plus 1/2 a yellow squash and a bit of fresh broccali. Wasn't sure what size pan to use so used an 8\"x 8\". It was pretty full so took more like 40-45 minutes to bake through. Main part of the dish was in the fridge overnight so maybe bringing to room temp in the morning might have helped the bake time. It did work fine to most everything the day prior and dump the eggs water and thyme over it just prior to baking though! Will make it again I'm sure.",
