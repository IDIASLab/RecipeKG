A hint if I may, always put the cooked rutabaga back into the pot and back on the burner to steam off the excess moisture and add the milks slowly, mine was a little wet for our liking.  The cinnamon  is very subtle and I would definitely use it again. I don't have a hand mixer so I used the emersion blender and seasoned it with freshly ground pepper and Maldon sea salt flakes.  Thanks for sharing.",

Being lazy, I simply mashed it with a potato masher, so it was not smooth.  If I make it again, I will puree it as instructed and serve with some moroccan chicken.",
