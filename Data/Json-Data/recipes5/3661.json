I used less than a full red onion (as it appeared 'overpowering') and I lightly tossed the red onion in the liquid before drizzling over the blue cheese. Lastly we had some left over and the blending of flavors overnight was marvelous. If you have the time I'd encourage making it at least 3-4 hours ahead of time. Very easy and lots of raves!",
