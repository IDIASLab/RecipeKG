In the instructions. I personally watched 3 you tube videos tandem still had to make my best guess.  \nHere goes...the first 50-60 minute cooking interval is SKIN SIDE DOWN. The second 20 minute cooking interval is bone side down. \nFirst interval is time or 150* in thickest part of meat   In this case it\u2019s the breast is the thickest part. The end temperature should be a minimum of 165*\nUse all burners on the grill to maintain a 375* temperature and keep grill lid closed as much as possible. \nThere are also videos on You Tube on spatchcocking a chicken for those, like me, that need a video demonstrations",
