Also they didn't hold together very well while cooking but that might have been because I pureed the yellow onion. It might also have been because our burgers ended up HUGE -- we used extra lean ground beef which basically means we had enough mixture for six patties instead of four. They also turned out very sticky and gooey which was pretty unappealing while they were being put together. The best thing about this meal was the chipotle pepper flavored corn chips I found at our Asian market to serve with them! Reduce the sugar by maybe half make the burgers pretty small and add cheese chips and anything else that will tone down the sweetness & stickiness and they just might work.",

If you read the description of the burger, it states that they are not exact measurements, so I really didn't have a problem in that area (my tastes), I did use a little less sugar, but everything else was as written.  Oh, I also mixed it into a pattie and put it in the fridge so that the flavors could \"marry\".  It was a good burger, not an everyday burger, but a really good once in a while burger (sweet tooth burger).  Next time I will try it topped with mango salsa, thanks Unachica!",
