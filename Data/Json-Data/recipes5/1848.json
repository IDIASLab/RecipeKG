So I scratched that, and used an orange bell pepper instead (worked really well! Highly recommend doing that!). I also used soaked bamboo skewers in place of metal skewers. Other than that, I kept everything else the same. Marinated the pork for about 36 hours, then cooked it on our charcoal grill for about 18 minutes. Oh, and I wouldn't recommend basting the skewers with the marinade--you'd be reintroducing raw pork 'juice' onto the cooked product, and that's just asking for trouble.",
