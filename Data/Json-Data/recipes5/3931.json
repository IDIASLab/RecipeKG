I did not have any ginger paste or garlic paste so I just added a few dashes of ground ginger and minced garlic along with an extra bit of olive oil.

I had a 14.5 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and then chopped up some romas that needed using up. I added 4 cloves of garlic and although I did not double the spices I heaped each amt. that the recipe called for. Only other spice addition was anise seed which I like in fish dishes. I usually don't use cilantro in Indian cooking because it tends to overpower the spices so just pinched off a small handful and chopped. Added some turkish flat beans for a little more veggie and served w/basmatic saffron rice. Thanks for this super quick and easy recipe!",
