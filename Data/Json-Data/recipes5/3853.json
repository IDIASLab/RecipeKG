I have found so many times that it's the recipe with the fewest most simple ingredients that turns out the best results. So true here.",

We used this on a quartered chicken (bone in) and marinated it for about an hour before grilling (didn't bother with the foil). I simmered the marinade for a few minutes after removing the chicken and then used it as a basting sauce. The flavor was excellent. The only thing I might change next time is the amount of salt--I think I will use a bit less. Thanks for sharing this one!",

I cut chicken tenders into bite size pieces then marinaded them for 8 hours. Once again I used just a tiny bit of the marinade to season the rice. I stir fried the chicken along with some sugar peas and served it all with the seasoned rice. What a wonderful recipe!",
