I have been making Pea Soup the same way for over 20 years and I have never ever \"sweat\" the onion, celery and garlic prior to adding the ingredients in the order of this recipe and I believe that THIS IS KEY to an AMAZING HAM & SPLIT PEA SOUP! I did a few things my old way such as simmered my ham bone for about an hour prior to starting the recipe.  I removed ham off of bone and used all the leftover ham that I had sliced from the previous \"baked ham\" dinner.  Instead of using chicken stock and water, I used the stock from the ham bone.  I added everything in the same order as Chef John, let simmer for a few hours and then added approx. 5 peeled, cubed potatos and 6 cut up carrots to the soup and let simmer another one to two hours longer.  I did simmer my soup on stovetop throughout the day for many hours (definitely stirring occasionaly).  My family from ages 9 - 55 LOVED LOVED this soup.  My husband stated that this was the ABSOLUTE BEST SPLIT PEA & HAM SOUP I have ever made.  Thank you for the added tips and directions on adding ingredients in a \"different way\"!  WOW, who would have known that it would make such A MAJOR DIFFERENCE!!  I can't wait to go home after work to eat some more of this GREAT SOUP!  BTW, I always double my recipe for my BIG EATIN FAMILY!!  I did save some of my ham stock to add to the \"thickened\" soup if needed. My family LOVES my cooking, but stated that \"my\" recipes have become even GREATER since I found CHEF JOHN. LOVE YOU XOXOXOXO",

Then added the split peas stirred it infor a couple of minutes before I added the Chicken Stock. I covered all with the chicken stock. Then a pinch of salt and pepper. Boiled it for 45 min. Stirred it continusly.  Then lowered temp to simmer the rest for an hour and 15mins. My husband couldnt get enough of it. Its was incredidble. Thank you",

The flavors really were as Chef John described, the smokey salty ham flavor married with the slightly sweat pea flavor. I guess the key is the \"sweating\" of the onions, garlic and celery in the butter, because I've made split pea soup many times and its never tasted nearly this good. I made a few minor alterations because of what I had on hand and because of what I needed to use up. I don't think these added or subtracted from the basic recipe, I'm just listing them here fwiw: (1) I used 48 oz turkey stock (instead of chicken stock.) and about 8 oz of water. (2) Added 2 small russett potatoes diced small (left skin on) and (3) about 8 baby carrots sliced about 1/8 inch. I placed it all in the slow cooker (added the butter, onions, garlic, celery after \"sweating\" them on the stove in a pan) and 10 hours later, the most delicious split pea soup I've ever eaten.",

I had no bay leaves, and I prefer to use olive oil for sauteing... I also added two chopped carrots to the recipe. And just for kicks and giggles, I added about 3/4 cup pinot grigio in the last 30 minutes. It almost doesn't matter what you do to this recipe, as long as you have a pound of ham, a pound of peas, and some broth, you will be happy.
