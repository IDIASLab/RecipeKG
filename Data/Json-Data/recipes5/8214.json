The only thing that I didn't double was the beef stock - I used 4 cups of homemade beef stock. I didn't have fresh mushrooms on hand so I used 2 4 oz. cans of mushrooms (probably should have used at least 3 cans) and used top round steak. After browning the meat and saut\u00e9ing the onions and garlic in the pressure cooker I added back the meat and the rest of the ingredients. I also added 1/4 cup of red wine. I pressure cooked everything for 20 minutes on the beef setting and let it slow release the pressure. Since I didn't double the amount of beef stock used I didn't double the cornstarch/water mixture but found that I had to double that so the gravy wasn't watery and more like gravy. I served it over mashed potatoes and my family loved it. By doubling the recipe I had enough for 3 meals for 3 of us. So we have two more meals to look forward to. The next time we have it I will try it over egg noodles. Thanks for the pressure cooker recipe Dennis. It was great and I will definitely make it again.",
