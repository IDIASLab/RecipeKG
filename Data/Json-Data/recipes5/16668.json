These are very versatile bars, you can add just about anything from M & M's to white chocolate chips to dried fruit varieties to candybar pieces.  These bars have now replaced my usual morning breakfast protien bar.  I use honey in place of the corn syrup, they come out wonderful.  For those of you who think this bar is dry, I have found the solution.  Use 1/2 cup butter/margarine instead of 1/3 cup and melt it before you add it.  And bake the bars for 15 minutes instead of 20.  These bars don't have any eggs in them so it's okay to underbake them quite a bit, as they will harden up after a few days of sitting on the counter (if they last that long!)  Thanks for the recipe, it's a good one!",

Coconut oil burns as energy instead of being stored as fat and can help pull fat from reserves to be used for energy and i used sunflower butter instead of peanut b/c its much healthier but also more expensive i also added about a 1/3 c of flax for coagulation (helps stuff stick w/o the butter) and for extra fiber and good fats. used walnuts sesame seeds raisins and choc chips as my mix ins....... they are AMAZING. i have been experiementing w/recipes for awhile and this is by far the best. After i put the mix in a pan i spread some more sun butter on top and then sprinkled go lean crunch (or granola) for some crunch it was a great add on. and we have been keeping them in the fridge which somehow makes them even better.",

I have made MANY failed attempts (yes they were healthy but were no more then dried out logs of nutrition). This recipe is a keeper! To cut back on the fat I'd omit the coconut (sorry... my fave too). I used a low-fat margarine amlonds instead of sunflower seeds Hershey's cinnamon chips instead of chocolate and used only 1 1/3 C oatmeal with 2C high protein cereal from Trader Joes. These were so yummy (even BEFORE baking!) that his athletes were lucky to get any. Not bad for a quick hunger fix while awaiting an event or for my kids who can be pretty picky! Thanks Karen.

I did leave out the coconut and sunflower seeds and substituted Sun Maid Dried Fruit Bits for the raisins.

Basically they are ok if you are looking for a snack you can make healthier than cookies but nothing I would make again.
