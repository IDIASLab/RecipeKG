The combination of spiced apples and brie cheese is amazing.  Great served with a spring lettuce salad.  You can also make this as an appetizer by using a baguette loaf instead of sourdough slices.",

You could use any type of cheese with this - a sharp cheddar would go nicely and would have a strong enough flavor to taste. Instead of sourdough bread I used a homemade sweet bread. My husband loved the sandwiches (although wants it for weekend brunches instead of dinner) and my wee ones inhaled the apples. I'll definitely be making this again!",
