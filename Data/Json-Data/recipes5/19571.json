I used a chuck roast instead of a brisket because it was on sale, and I cooked it in my crock pot. I did sautee the onions and garlic first, and seasoned and seared the meat as well before putting it in my crockpot on top of a layer of thick sliced potatoes and onions (you can remove them later if you want, but we kept it in the with shredded meat and it was awesome). I blended all of the ingredients following the recipe exactly except that i used 2 cans of tomatillo sauce instead of whole tomatillos and also i used dos equis amber to replace the water ( you could also use beef broth too, which I did add a bit of as well). Cooked for 5-6 hours. We made home made corn tortillas and black beans and rice. Finished off the rest of the Dos Equis...Awesome dinner!!! I will definately be making this again!!",

I couldn't find canned tomatillos at my grocer so we bought a pound of regular tomatillos - and that worked fine! Also, my pressure cooker isn't the type that goes on the stove, it is a stand alone unit and it didn't have a \"medium\" pressure setting - so I just cooked it on high for an hour instead and it was perfect! The chipotle spice was perfect for my husband and I - but if I cooked this for the kids I would need to cut WAY back :) - \n\nI will make this recipe again for sure. This would probably work with any large cut of meat - though the brisket was a great way to go. VERY minimal prep and the pressure cooker does the work for you. Wonderful!",

Don't be afraid to use the entire can of chipotle peppers since the heat cooks out quite a bit.  Excellent recipe but I think I'll keep making it with fresh tomatillos as they seemed to add a good tang to it!",
