We cooked it with half of the mushrooms and you cannot even taste the mushrooms in there (for people who don\u2019t like mushrooms). We did a VERY FINE chop on the mushrooms and onions and it blended perfectly with everything.",

This time I replaced the water with beef broth and used 8 oz of sour cream when it called for 4 oz (I made 4 servings) . i was kinda concerned about adding so much sour cream because i can't stand the flavor but it wasnt over powering at all. I added salt and pepper when the hamburger was cooking up. Instead of using half a container of the lipton dry onion mix i used the whole thing. I think it tasted much better this time around. I also pressured cooked on high for 6 min and then quick released the pressure.  Noodles weren't mushy. I used a 6 qt cooker.",
