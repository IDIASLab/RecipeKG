I consider myself to be a more advanced cook so therefore when making the risotto I heated the broth/wine and added it by 1/2 cup measures as you're supposed to do when making risotto.  So as a result, it takes much longer than the recipe states. The sourness of the wine/lemon juice completely overpowers the flavour of everything else (the seafood choices in this recipe are such delicate flavours!).  I made this for my husband and mother and none of us cared for it.",

I didn't put any lemon into the risotto since the wine had plenty of citrus flavors. Thanks for submitting this recipe. After a few changes we had a great meal.",

I didn't follow the directions exactly with respect to the risotto technique but instead followed the method I always use: after cooking the rice for a minute or two in the oil add about 1/2 cup of wine. When that has been absorbed add the chicken stock about 1/2 cup at a time stirring frequently and adding the next 1/2 cup after the previous one has been mostly absorbed. (Note: The stirring is important because it releases the starches in the rice which is what makes risotto so creamy without using any actual cream.) When the rice seemed like it was about 5 minutes away from being done I added the peppers scallops etc. The name of this dish is a bit of a misnomer. The lemon added at the end makes a huge difference in brightening up the dish and I really loved it but it does not taste lemony. Just a warning in case you are craving something with a real lemon zing!",
