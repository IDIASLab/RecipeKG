So my review is for the tamales themselves. These turned out really good. The only real problem I had was getting the tamales to hold together during the steaming process. Could be a user error but I will tie them up with cooking twine next time. My dough might have been too wet too? I'm not sure but these tasted fantastic! I will definitely make these again!",
