There is a restaurant in Portland that used to serve \"Capellini & Gorganzola\" this is the closest Gorganzola sauce I have found to duplicate the recipe. It must be the nutmeg!

Well we have been married almost 35 years and I have cooked a lot of very good pasta dishes so that was a huge compliment. I liked it too! I pretty much followed the recipe except I might have used a little more gorgonzola than specified. REVISED 3/19/2011: I have now made this sauce 3 times. The secret I believe is the quality of the ingredients. Don't expect great results if using gorgonzola that is purchased already crumbled. Trust me; it makes a difference. Also be sure to reduce the wine as directed. Otherwise sauce may be runny or curdled and the taste of wine may be overpowering.",
