I did like some other reviewers suggested and used half mayo half sour cream because it seemed like a lot of sour cream to me. I also used half the lemon juice called for and added some relish for sweetness. The relish helped to balance the sourness. As the grapes weren't looking very good in the grocery store I used a green apple instead and it complemented the ham just as well as the grapes would have. Very tasty and a nice change.",
