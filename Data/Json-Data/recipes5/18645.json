What I really liked about this recipe is the unique combination of beans--it makes for an attractive medley of colors and flavor. The peppers are great addition too. (I added a yellow pepper for extra color and flavor as well.) To kick it up another notch, I also added some garlic, dash of ground mustard and used spicy italian sausage instead of pork sausage. (I was worried the italian spice would compete with the BBQ flavors, but it blended perfectly.)  Overall, it was great and everyone loved it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The only thing that I did differently was I cooked it for 12 hours on low and added about a 1/2 cup of water to thin out the sauce a little at the end of the 12 hours. I cooked it this long only because our church dinner was right after morning church so there wasn't enough time to cook it in the morning. I will definitely use it again no changes at all!!!",
