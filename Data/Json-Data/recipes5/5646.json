And for me, that might have been my downfall because I felt that it needed a little more flavor.  Hubby didn't agree with me at all!  He loved it!  I did think the amount of marinade was running a little short, so don't be afraid to add more of it!  I liked the idea of the corn flakes and walnuts.  I will make this again, using the full marinating time.  Thanks, patti!  We had enough left over for dinner the second night, too!",
