However I thought it was a little bland and this is after adding basil oregano garlic powder and more salt and pepper. I think I will add some cayenne pepper next time and maybe use a salsa instead of the V-8. I also used venison salami instead of the chicken which defiantly added to the flavor.",

The only change I made was that I didn't have the spicy V8 juice and subbed regular and added a bit of crushed red pepper for the bite. I think it's also a great recipe you could play around with. Fresh grated parmesan would have been nice.",
