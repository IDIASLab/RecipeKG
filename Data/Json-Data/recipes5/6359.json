So instead of using 1 cup of self-rising flour, use 1 cup flour, 1 1/2 t. baking soda and 1/4 t. salt.\n     Also, 400 degrees for a cake is way too hot. My first attempt (I always follow the recipe the first time) turned into very dark brown crusts and a mushy center. Reduce the temp to 350 and bake until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.\n     Then on to the frosting/filling. Omit the raw sugar, it's just not necessary. Use the butter and lemon juice and add powdered sugar until it's the consistency that you like. I would separate the butter and lemon in half, make the filling a little thicker with one half and thinner frosting with the other half.\n     Oh! And the picture associated with the recipe? That's not it.\n     All of that said, I'm looking forward to the next time I make it. I love lemon! I'll serve it with fresh whipped cream (with a little sugar) and raspberries.",

It's a rather coarse cake.  \nOne warning: do NOT open the oven door to check on the cake until you're pretty sure it should be done. Two of the cakes fell - quite a bit.  If I make it again,I'd eliminate that sugar/lemon juice syrup in between layers - it doesn't allow for a bond between the two layers - I made rectangular cakes - when we cut the cake, the sides fell away. Or I'd just make a single layer cake and poke holes and add the syrup on top and then ice. Or if I make it again, I'd thicken the filling with cornstarch for a more substantial filling. I just wouldn't make it as written.",

Isn't too sweet or tart just a perfect balance of all flavours. This will definitely turn into a staple around here. Thank you reb.zemp for the recipe.",
