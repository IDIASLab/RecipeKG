The finished brownies look good on the outside and have the right kind top \"crust\" to them but the inside was almost like jelly and they oozed oil. I think there isn't enough starch in the recipe or too much oil or too much yam. I'I don't think I'll try this recipe again given all the changes that will have to be made.",
