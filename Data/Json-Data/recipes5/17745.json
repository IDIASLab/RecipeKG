I found cooling the entire mixture and rolling the dough into small balls gave the best result. I also used a convection oven and just lowered the temp to 325 which gave a more even tone to the cookie. Don't let them get too brown on the edges or they may be slightly bitter. Use parchment paper. If you are cheap you can wipe off the parchment paper a few times with a paper towel or reuse. Also be wary of spreading. If you cool it completely they spread a little less and you can get about 8 cookies on a standard cookie sheet without them touching. Great simple recipe.  With small cookies I was actually able to make about 100 cookies.",
