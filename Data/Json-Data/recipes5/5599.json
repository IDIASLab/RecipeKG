I used brown rice in this recipe and did not have chicken bouillion granules so what I did was used homemade chicken broth and increased the liquid to almost a full cup. I use petite diced tomatoes and took another reviewer's suggestion and added a half teaspoon each of cumin mexican oregano and chili powder as well as a good amount fresh minced garlic. Not bad--it definetly needed additional spice. I was surprized that it worked well with the brown rice but in a good way. I would make this again BUT I would play with the recipe a bit next time.",

I think it needed some spices added like cumin or chili powder. I did use rotel instead of just peeled tomatoes and I do think that helped. My husband thought it was pretty good though and tasted more like rice you would get in a Mexican restaurant. The problem I did have though was that the liquid was absorbed into the rice in the 20 minute cooking time but even after sitting the additional 5 minutes the rice still had a slight crunch to it. I don't plan on making this again.",

Unfortunately I did not have cilantro which would make this very delicious. Problem I see with this recipe and why I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is that there is not enough liquid. For 2 cups rice you need at least 4 cups liquid. All rice I have ever made you need 1 part rice to 2 parts liquid.",

I did not roast the jalape\u00f1o just chopped up fine and it cooked down. I like my rice more dry than wet. This was moist but next day was just the way I like it!!",
