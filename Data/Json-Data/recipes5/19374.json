I followed the suggestion to add a little more flour so I used 2 tablespoons flour.  I made homemade caramel sauce and put some in the bottom and on top of the apples as well as drizzled over the finished pie.  I didin't think 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon was quite enough for crumble topping so I added a whole teaspoon.  I cut back on the brown sugar in the pie filling to 1/4 cup since the caramel and the crumb topping was already sweet.  I want to taste a littel tartness from the apples.  Suggestions for soggy crust.  When you are preheating your oven, pop your crust in for about 5 minutes before you fill.  Someone suggested to me a long time ago and I do every pie this way, even the ones I freeze.  I have no problems with doughy or soggy crust.  I'm giving a 4 star since it is a good start to a pie but I did have to altar the recipe.",

I also cut back the brown sugar in the filling by half so it wouldn't be too sweet (as quite a few reviewers commented it was too sweet) and added nutmeg to the topping and filling. I used pecans in the topping instead of almonds only because my husband dosen't like almonds. I thought there was a little too much topping I didn't use it all. I think next time I make the crumble topping I'll increase the butter. This came out very well it was a very pretty pie. The issue I had was though it looked quite pretty once I cut it it bled all over the place and fell apart. And it didn't taste good with the extra flour on the bottom to keep it from being soggy. We didn't go past that. I'm sorry.It was pretty. I feel bad that it just didn't work out for us.",

I thought the amount of caramel was subtle but definitely noticeable. since I love caramel I will use just as much caramel next time even with less apples.",

I took a lot of the reviews and added flour to the bottom of the pie and 1 tsp cornstarch to thicken it up. I wasn't runny at all! I also omitted the caramel during the baking process since everyone said you couldn't taste it. I added the caramel on each piece before serving and you still couldn't really taste it over all the other flavors but with vanilla ice cream it was great. I took a tip off the pie shell box and after baking for 15 minutes I put foil around the crust's edges and they baked perfect! Will be making this again next year.",

The second time I made it I made it in a 9x13 aluminum pan and did 1 1/2 times the recipe and I used pecans because it is what I already had. I drizzed it with a little of the carmel sauce for looks too. I used the No roll Pie Crust I from this site and it was great too. Mixed the dough right in the pan I spread it in. Very easy. Great recipe. taking it to a wienie roast tonight. Oh I did double the cinnamon in the topping but I love cinnamon.",
