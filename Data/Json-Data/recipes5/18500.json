The changes I made to the sauce were: I lacked peanut sauce so I used 2 tbls. of peanut butter I increased the chicken broth to 1 cup added 1 tbls lime juce and 1/4 cup plain yougurt. I also used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil on the chicken. The dish was very flavorful but not spicy so if you like heat you may want to add some cayenne. Highly recomended.",
