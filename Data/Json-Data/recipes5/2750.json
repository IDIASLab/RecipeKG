This tastes like something you\u2019d get in a fancy restaurant. The flavors are perfectly balanced \u2013 super creamy, with slight heat from the Creole seasoning and tang from the mustard. No changes needed!  This is something that is gourmet enough to serve company, but quick enough for a busy weeknight meal on a chilly day. My local stores keep Creole mustard in the Cajun/Creole section within the international aisle (Zatarain's brand)\u2013 not with the other mustards and condiments.  If you can't find any, substitute whole- or coarse-grain mustard. A definite keeper!",
