                "reviewBody": "The concept for these tacos was good, and the flavor was there.  The recipe was not well conceived, however. \nIt wasn't clear how much eggplant to use. It would have been better to specify what kind of eggplant (European, Italian, Japanese) and what size (small, medium, large). Even better would have been to specify the weight. Also, should it be peeled or not? What size cubes should it be cut into? For the four taco shells it called for, we used seven medium-sized Japanese eggplants, peeled. \nThe amount of lemon juice and spice mix called for was way out of proportion. We used only one quarter of the amount called for and it was plenty. \nThe order of adding ingredients to the pan wasn't smart either. The garlic will burn before the eggplant is cooked. We added the onion and the eggplant to the pan together first. Then we added the spice mix and the garlic and jalape\u00f1o. Finally, after the eggplant was cooked, we added the lemon juice. \nThe consistency, as expected, was mushy. We didn't care for this consistency. It might have been better inside a flour tortilla and rolled like a burrito.\nThe author states that you won't miss the meat. But, unless you pair this recipe with some beans (or other protein), your body will miss the protein. We served beans and rice on the side.",
