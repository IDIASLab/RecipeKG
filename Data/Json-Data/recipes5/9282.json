Because I was making these for children I used Baileys non alcoholic iris cream coffee creamer instead of the liquor. For my husband and myself I made the alcoholic recipe using only 1 1/2oz of Baileys instead because I felt 2 1/2 would be overpowering. Everyone loved them kids & adults!! I am thinking of making this for Christmas and letting it sit overnight in the fridge then baking them on Christmas morning. Definitely a treat!! Great recipe!",

I added a pinch of salt to the batter and will add a bigger pinch next time for a little salt/sweet contrast. After a halfhearted effort whisking I busted out our hand mixer to make light work of the whipped cream. We topped with butter maple syrup and the whipped cream for a decadent holiday season breakfast. Thanks for the recipe Baileys!",

The whipped cream is wonderful on top but the whisk wasn't working for me so I used a hand mixer. I used chocolate syrup instead of melted chips which made it easy to put on top and I used sliced banana instead of berries. I will probably be trying this again some time!",
