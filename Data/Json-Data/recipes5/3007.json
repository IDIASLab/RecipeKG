Tonight I warmed some Turkish flatbread in the oven, spread the chickpea filling on it generously, threw some halved cherry tomatoes and thin slices of cucumber on and drizzled with a bit of light yoghurt. Then wrapped it all up burrito-style. After the first bite I thought it was a nice 4 star spread, but it kept tasting better and better with each bite. Now I am finding it hard no to attack the leftovers with a spoon and eat up the whole lot. So good. Wonderful texture, the dill works great (esecially with the salad and yoghurt) and its so healthy. Fingerlicking good. Thanks.",

I omitted the celery (personal preference) and used less onions.  I used fat free mayo, no sugar added relish, and the dill weed and lemon were perfect!!  mashing the chickpeas took some time (I tried using a mixer... not the best idea.  There were chickpeas firing everywhere!) but it was all well worth it!  \n\nWe used it to fill pitas, along with romaine and tomato slices.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!  With 3 vegetarians and 3 non-veg, we all agreeded it was simply amazing!!!  My Grandmother didn't even realize it wasn't tuna!",
