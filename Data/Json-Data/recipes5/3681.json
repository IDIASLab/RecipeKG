Just in time too as a little fond had formed in the last few mins of cooking which gave the veggies an extra punch of flavor and was fine with me. The chops were perfect!",

Note here is only for others like me who might not have all ingredients on hand. I used 2 green bell peppers and did not have banana peppers. I used lemon but didn't have lime. And I used red wine vinegar because that's what I had. I did sprinkle a little Cajun seasoning in the chops too but it was probably not needed. They were really flavorful and the veggies were too. I added about a tablespoon or two of butter at the end a small pat on each chop to keep them from going dry and add flavor. I really loved this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.!!",
