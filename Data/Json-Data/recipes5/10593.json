I did add one clove of chopped garlic the last 30 seconds after browning the onions and right before adding in the spinach.  Baking time was accurate and it was perfect.  I also put a dollop of Greek yogurt on top just before serving.  Next time I make this I'm going to add some dried oregano with the egg mixture so it will have a Greek flavor.  I plan on making this dish more often as it was so easy for a quick meal.  Thanks Chef John, this is a keeper!",

I followed the recipe as far as ingredients, but since I don't have a saute pan I can put in the oven I piled everything into a quiche pan (10 1/2\" diameter;  2\" height).  It was therefore not as thin as in a large saute pan, so took longer to set (approx 30 minutes).  I also really don't like runny eggs, so the 30 minutes let it set all the way through and was a little browned on top without broiling, but without making the eggs tough.  I will definitely make this again.  I could easily cut this into 1\" pieces to make appetizers, too.",
