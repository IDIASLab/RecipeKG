I love yams with brown sugar and nuts and my husband is a marshmellow man. This way he can get all the gooey marshmellows of the top and the second layer lets me have them my way. I made this several times after thanksgiving and this year I tried something different. I mashed the yams with butter before layering (so we could cut the butter in half) and also used pecans for a more traditional taste. It was fantastic! Thanks for the recipe!",

Let cool a couple of min and then peel away skin slice and continue with recipe. I've also made this with pecans instead of cashews and everyone always loves it.",

I used a 40 oz can of cut yams (drained the juice). I didn't have cashews so I just left them out. I cooked it in the microwave for approx. 6 minutes added the marshmallows and cooked another 1 1/2 min. The marshmallows didn't brown but we didn't care...they tasted fabulous! Next time (when I'm not in a hurry) I'll cook it exactly as written and I know they'd rate a 10 if possible! Thanks for sharing.",

I searched for hours until I decided on this recipe: I wanted one with recognizable pieces of sweet potato instead of a mash some sweetness but not syrupy and a marshmallow topping. I have never made sweet potatoes any other way than roasting plain with oil and salt but following this recipe gave me EXACTLY the dish I was looking for. I used pecans instead of cashews for preference that was my only change. Everyone at dinner enjoyed them I hoarded the few leftovers and those are delicious reheated too. Cara I really appreciate you sharing this recipe this is now my ultimate sweet potato casserole and I was so proud to bring this to Thanksgiving thanks so much!",
