That said, using this recipe as a base, I kept to the general flavors and principles...verdict: yum! The concept is really good. I had 2 poblano peppers and 2 jalapeno peppers, which I roasted in the oven rather than pan-roast. Same effect. I added a 4-oz can of chopped chilies as well. I used half a brick of light cream cheese and half a container of sour cream, fat free half and half, and just enough pasta water to get the consistency I wanted. Added more salt to taste. Next time I might add cumin as well. I used whole wheat pasta, and this ended up being a little more healthy and delicious!",

I don\u2019t like the smell of roasted chilies in my home.\nI only had one (1) jar of crema as that\u2019s all my husband purchased, I thinned the chilies, crema, garlic with milk in blender until well blended.\nI topped my dish with cotija cheese & husband chose Parmesan. I have to say.. I thought my dish was better tasting. I also thought it needed a little more salt but is preferential.",

Poblano peppers are amazing, so either texture/flavor profile will be great.\n\nI also added about 1/4 cup fresh basil to the sauce.",
