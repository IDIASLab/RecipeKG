If you do not wrap the completed cake with a piece of cheesecloth soaked in rum or wine and keep it slightly moist by pouring more wine over the cake every 3-4 days,  the cake will become so dry you cannot eat it and it will crumble up.  This cake was one similar to fruitcake that was preserved over several weeks  for any \"stoppers-by\" guests at a tavern or home, and thats how it was made to last so long.  Preserving it with the wine!  Thank you so much for posting this happy memory recipe!  You are right it is a VERY VERY OLD recipe!",

When I was a little girl we always put out Hermit Cake for Santa on Christmas Eve. He always ate every bite! We have always made it 3 weeks ahead of when we actually wanted to serve it. Once it is baked and cooled down then wrap it in cloths soaked in a red wine and wrung out. ( I use Barefoot Sweet Red wine). Wrap aluminum foil around the cake wrapped in the cloths. Put it in a cake keeper/carrier in a cool place and check the cloths once a week to make sure they haven't dried out. I usually soak them again each week and reapply them. In three weeks the cake is ready to eat. I always make this right after Thanksgiving so that it is ready to eat for Christmas. My favorite Christmas Desert!",
