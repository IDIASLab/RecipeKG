The sauce seemed like something my family wouldn't eat so I made my own: remaining 1/2 cup coconut milk (light), 1/4 cup water, juice from 1 lime, 2 tsp. soy sauce, 3 TBSP sugar and 3 TBSP corn starch. Whisk in a pot before putting on heat, bring to a boil and keep warm until served. My PICKY PICKY kids devoured this! Thanks!!!",

For example, I didn't have lime juice so I used lemon and my son eats GF so I used GF crumbs instead of panko and I combined all dry ingredients together, the GF flour, coconut and crumbs and the results were 5 start dining!  As for the sauce, I took advise from others and tweaked it a bit to suit the taste of my family...i still used the mayo and coconut milk but I added soy sauce about a tsp and cayenne for spice.  DELICIOUS chicken...my 8 and 2 year old devoured it, my daughter was on the fence (a little too different for her) and my hubby loved it and is having the left overs for lunch!  I made it as chicken breasts and served it with side salads.  Thanks for this awesome and unique recipe!",

I made it nearly exactly as stated except for my use of full fat mayo instead of low fat :), and I pan fried them in coconut oil rather than baking them. The result was fantastic. The breading stayed attached just fine, the flavors balanced wonderfully, and the coconut was apparent without being overwhelming. The sauce was great too. I didn't really know what to expect with a mayo and coconut topping, but drizzling that on top was quite flavor enhancing. I added about a tsp of brown sugar to it for a bit more sweetness. I recommend that if you are into that kind of thing. \n\nOverall - fabulous recipe!",
