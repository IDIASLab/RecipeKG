I had to make some substitutions (pearl couscous instead of quinoa and lime instead of lemon), but wanted to write a review since no one else had reviewed it yet. The citrus flavor is nicely offset by the rich, salty nutty-ness of the sunflower seeds. The huckleberries surprised me by not being distracting. Thanks for the great non-dessert huckleberry recipe! I'll be making this again.",

The green makes it even more colorful and added the bit of flavor I was looking for.   Maybe diced cucumber I\u2019m thinking. This really is great as is and serves as a base to be creative with depending what you have on hand.",
