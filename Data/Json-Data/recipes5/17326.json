I found this recipe online and it looked so easy and I love apples so I thought this might work. Oh my God it was SO easy and it tasted so very good! It was a big hit!! Since she was having so many people over I doubled the recipe and made it in a disposable foil pan in the oven rather than the microwave. I also sprinkled about a half cup of chopped pecans over the top to make it look a litle fancier and add some crunch. I baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes and she had it in a chafing dish at her house to keep it warm. It was awesome! I got lots of compliments:)",
