These turned out fluffy and tasted great. I'd make these again. I might add another 1/2 c. of oatmeal next time the batter was just a little thin even after letting it sit for 15 minutes.",

The cornmeal adds a great crunch, and they have great flavor and sweetness, in spite of the low amount of sugar.  This is definitely a keeper.  I had to add more whole wheat flour (1/3-1/2 c.) to make the consistently thicker.  I used old-fashioned rolled oats vs. quick.  I used powdered buttermilk mixed with 1 cup water, 1 cup milk.  I also added a couple teaspoons of vanilla and few dashes salt.  I love that it's such a healthy recipe, so easy, and so delicious!  It made 16 - 4\" pancakes, enough for freezing.",

These modifications have worked well for us: adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt reducing the buttermilk to 1 3/4 cup (using sour milk is alright but not quite as amazing) and adding 1/4 cup oil. Replacing brown sugar with white sugar is fine. We find that adding vanilla can distract from the flavor of the grains. Even though we think this recipe is better with our modifications it still gets 5 stars because it's a flexible recipe and a terrific food concept.",

I also didn't have buttermilk and was running low on milk as well but I did have a cup of cottage cheese in my fridge that I wanted to use up. So I mashed up the cottage cheese and substituted 1 cup of the buttermilk with that and the other cup of buttermilk I substituted with 1 cup of milk that I soured with lemon juice. I also added some vanilla and cinnamon for a little extra flavor. Because I used the cottage cheese I had no problem with the batter being thin it ended up being pretty thick. I had to use a little water to thin it down. The pancakes cooked up beautifully. I topped them with the \"Cinnamon Apple Syrup\" recipe found on this website. Delicious! I'm excited to buy cornmeal and try this recipe again.",

Even our pickiest kids who only like the light n fluffy pancakes devoured these. We did add a touch of vanilla to the mix and added more liquid to make the batter a little thinner. We used the powdered buttermilk stuff and will hopefully have the real deal on-hand next time. Also ground the oatmeal in a mini processor which helped hide the whole grains from the kids.
