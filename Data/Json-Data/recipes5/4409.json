While baking demands precise measurements, cooking does not. One's potato might \nbe larger or smaller than others' and so the total amount of one reviewer's potatoes might be \ncompletely different from another's and require more \nor less oil.  I'd say use your judgment with this, and use enough to adequately coat the potatoes. I had great success with these--I used a combination of olive oil and butter and otherwise followed the recipe. It may be because I scaled this down to two servings that the potatoes needed about 1o minutes less cooking time, although I did cut them up small.  Hubby went on and on about these--perfectly browned and crispy on the outside and almost creamy (according to hubs)on the inside--his point being they weren't mealy. I used Yukon Golds, unpeeled and again, cut into small cubes, which may account for that.  The lemon is discreet, not enough to scream \"LEMON\" but just enough to make you notice something pleasant you couldn't quite put your finger on. Dill is something we always enjoy on potatoes and we did here as well. Great recipe, one we really enjoyed, and a definite \"make again\" seal of approval from hubs!",

I scrubbed it and cubed it but left the skin on (so it gets crispy - yummy). I also subbed oregano for dill and chicken stock and olive oil for butter and canola oil. I mixed everything in a liquid measuring cup and then poured over the potatoes in the pan. Then I just squeezed fresh lemon juice over all. So fast so easy and so so good. Highly recommend.",
