I'm rating it a 4 instead of a 5 only because I think that there will be a number of people who will say it's too sweet and some who will think that there's not enough flavor.  It's a mild flavor for sure.  I must admit to having used lemon olive oil, and that's probably the reason I loved it.  I would think that those who love the taste of the salad rather than he dressing would agree that this is great.  I would recommend it for sure, and I'm also positive that my DIL will agree that it's wonderful!  Thanks, Becky!  EDIT THE NEXT DAY!  I changed my rating to a 5!  :)",
