The chicken comes out ridiculously juicy, just how I like it - my biggest food pet peeve is overcooked, dry chicken, and this is anything but dry! (For reference, my chicken breasts were about 8-10 ounces each and I pounded down the thick end a bit for an even thickness; cooked for 23 mins.) On a not so good note, the flavor is what knocked 2 stars off for me. Not only was there way too much seasoning for 4 breasts, it was incredibly bitter from the paprika, and bland from the lack of salt. I added some salt after cooking, and that helped a lot, but I did not finish my piece of chicken. I would definitely use this method again, but with a different seasoning.",
