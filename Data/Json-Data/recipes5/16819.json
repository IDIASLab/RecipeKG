But be prepared for how messy the chocolate can be a little planning and you can avoid a big problem. If you work slow keep your chocolate warm and be sure to use and glass bowl instead of a metal mixing bowl. The chocolate will solidify when it meets the metal bowl and then you've got a lot of scraping to do! Keep those things in mind and this is an easy recipe with \"to-die-for\" results. Definately a keeper!",
