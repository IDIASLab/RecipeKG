I did give a few of the best ones to The Woman I Love and she thought they were great. On the plus side these are quick and easy to make. I was in a hurry and didn't mix the wet and dry ingredients exactly as given so hopefully that didn't affect my results; I did use all the correct ingredients and amounts though. This made two batches for me. For the second batch I used a greased (with butter-flavored cooking spray) cookie sheet which was a mistake as the cookies burned a bit. The ungreased non-stick cookie sheet I used for my first batch worked best.",
