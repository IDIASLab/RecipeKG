Used fresh squeezed lemon and orange juice as I didn't have concentrate available and glad I didn't as I believe it kept the flavors more simplistic. This recipe was a refreshing change from other root vegetables!  Sweet, savory, and very pleasing to the eye. Great complement and one that will make it's way to our table from time to time....  Thanks Taddo1965!",

I always modify recipes to match what I have in the house and our preferences, so with this I used only 2 tablespoons butter, an orange instead of orange juice, lots of stock (2 or 3 cups), balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice and no chives.  It was great, sweet and savory.  Very sweet considering the sugar is all natural sugars in the veggies, orange and vinegar.  They taste almost candied.  They also look like they will keep well in the fridge so we can microwave them as a side for later meals.",
