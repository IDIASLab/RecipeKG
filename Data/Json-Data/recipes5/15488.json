Try putting crumbled cheese doritos on it instead of the corn tortilla chips it gives it a really good favor and still the crunch. Also I always put lite western dressing over top of taco salad and some black olives of course its soooo good. I know I pretty much changed the whole recipe but the main reason I looked it up was cause I forgot what kind of beans go in it. I hope this helps.:o)",
