The only issue for me was using a baking sheet to spread them out which was difficult. Then icing them was not smooth. I tried and abandoned the idea. I ended up rolling them into balls warming the icing then drizzling it over them. This way was prettier and easing to serve to guests. I topped them with some fresh grated coconut.",

We are definitely making these again.",
