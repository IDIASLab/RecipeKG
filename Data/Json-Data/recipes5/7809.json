It is easy to make and the pesto sauce is also delicious and very easy.  One thing I would do differently is to make the rectangle with the dough a little bit smaller than what the recipe says because it stretches out a lot as you work with it.  I had two very long pieces to work with which made it a bit challenging when it came to braiding it.  Other than that, this bread is ah-mazing!!!",
