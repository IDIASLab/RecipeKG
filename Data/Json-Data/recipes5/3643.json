I followed the recipe exactly rare for me but there's little sense in changing a recipe then reviewing the original and criticizing it. Keep in mind that any citrus especially lime juice begins to \"cook\" raw seafood.... so if you marinade the shrimp for a longer exposure to the ingredients you have effectively prepared a variant of ceviche. I think if I were to make this again I would suggest reserving the marinade until the shrimp are just about finished on the grill and pour it over the shrimp to create a \"glaze\" on the shrimp.",
