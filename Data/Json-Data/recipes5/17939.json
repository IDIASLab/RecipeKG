When I lived in Holland, this drink was a staple in the diet of a bunch of hippies who lived in and around a squatted building known as 'De Elf.'  Sadly, the building was closed a year after I left the country, but if you combine the taste of this drink with the smell of musky smoke and Nag Champa incense, you're halfway to recreating the atmosphere.  Enjoy...",

I added one vanilla bean sliced into 2\" lengths but next time I may just use vanilla soymilk instead of plain soymilk. I substituted honey for the brown sugar. I preferred mine much sweeter so I greatly increased the amount of sweetener. This is great hot or cold. Thanks for the great recipe!!!",

But this was great I used to make myself chai every morning.. except I would make the tea with water and just add a splash of soymilk. but this is so creamy and doesnt take very long so I think I'll do this next time I want some chai:) maybe even add a piece of orange peel.",
