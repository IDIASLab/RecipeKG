I had to make a change due to what I had but am rating anyway because I think the result would have been VERY similar. I didn't have creamy Italian dressing but only had regular. Assuming (and I apologize if I'm wrong) that creamy Italian dressing has a \"mayo-like\" base I used the bottle of regular Italian dressing in place of the creamy and then used 1/3 cup mayo in place of the regular Italian which I'm thinking \"evened\" everything out. Everything else I followed EXACT. SOOOOO GOOD!!! Where has this recipe been all my life?! I can't wait to try this out on everyone this summer at family and neighborhood BBQs!",
