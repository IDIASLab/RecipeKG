I might skip the flour altogether, since I didn't really feel it was needed and gave the fish a bit of a gummy texture after simmering in the sauce.   The 5 minute searing time was perfect, however before adding the salmon back into the pan, I reduced the sauce on its own for 5 minutes. I then added the fish back in and simmered an additional 3-4 minutes. There's no way the sauce would have reduced down enough with the given directions.  The sauce is very tangy, which I loved!",
