I had to beat the egg white about 3-4 minutes during each time to get to the correct consistency. I used pre-chopped walnuts from the bag and a 1 Tablespoon cookie scoop to make level even-sized cookies, so they dried at the same time in the oven. I got 15 with half the recipe. When done, they will be slightly cracked on top.  Mine took exactly the 40 minutes. Wait until slightly cool and slide a thin spatula under them to avoid any breaking. These were like little merengue cookies, but improved with the brown sugar. They were eaten up quite quickly.",

I put them back in for the remaining 5 minutes and they turned out perfect! These will definitely be made again- and soon!",

I added in 1/8 tsp each of salt and cream of tartar to the eggs before beating. And a tsp of vanilla extract with the nuts. I substituted the nuts for 1/2 cup choc chips and 1 1/2 cups pecans because that's what I had on hand and what sounded good:) I used the whisk attachment on my hand-mixer and I think that works better than beaters. I used a glass bowl because I didn't have metal and let it chill in the freezer for about 10min( a tip I got from tv) and let my eggs warm up on the counter for about 40min. My cookies were done in 40mins perfectly! Thank you will make again and again! Try it these are fantastic!",
