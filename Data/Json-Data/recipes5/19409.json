I changed a few things because of ingredients I had around the house:  I simplified the ingredients, didn't have dry mustard or celery so I used a little dijon instead and skipped the celery.  I left out the zuchini and put in a green bell instead to give the green color.  added some green onions too. I did not use brown sugar (which I'm sure would taste great) but opted for granulated splenda for diet reasons.   It was such a hit that my grandmother who is the amazing cook of the family wanted the recipe.  Didn't tell my grandmother about the splenda though.  She would have spit it out. :)",

I made one modification; instead of shredding the cabbage I chopped it so that it isn't as wet and limp. I mixed a third of the slaw up at first then mixed up more as it got low. I could also save any leftovers since the dressing was separate. Highly recommend!!",

It is a very pretty salad; and we were all looking forward to having some. The dressing is wonderful. I thought there might have been too much going on in the dressing but the flavors all blend well. I did add extra brown sugar (just a little to taste) as I felt it was a little bitter as written. I had to use three zucchini and three yellow peppers but that could have been because my cabbage was too big. They were all the same size at the store. All in all beautiful delicious and crowd pleasing salad. Thanks!",
