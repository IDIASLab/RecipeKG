We have been together ever since! Adjust the garlic and vinegar to your liking. I happen to believe that garlic should be included in every meal,so I tend to add more depending on my mood. Don't be put off by the smell of the vinegar. As it cooks down, it becomes sweet and not as strong. Your nose may tell you otherwise! I serve a Pinot Grigio and rice pilaf with this dish to round out the meal.",

Then after I read a few reviewers and some people said that they doubled the sauce I decided to give it a try. I browned the chicken first and set aside then saut\u00e9ed the onions garlic and vegetables (I only had green/red bell peppers and onions on hand) then all other ingredients along with cup of chicken broth and added everything in my crockpot for a couple of hours.

The only changes I made were: using boneless thighs (3 per person; thighs are tastier & moister) adding a couple of teaspoons of balsamic vinegar to the chicken as it was frying as it looked anemic) & doubling the sauce (we all love sauce next time I will triple it). Served it with basmati rice & green olive with chives baguette (sopped up the jus - no butter necessary). Will make it again soon.",

The only reason I didn't give it a five-star is because I feel the chicken breast should be marinated in balsamic vinegar for at least 4 hours if not preferably overnight.

Make it exactly as described and it will be great. I steamed the asparagus in my steamer instead of sauteing then mixed it in. That's personal preference though it lessens the time to cook the peppers as my wok was already full. Easy healthy and I will definitely be eating again. Thanks for sharing!",
