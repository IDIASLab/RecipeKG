The advantages are obvious and quite delicious. Using this method, you get to choose the cut you like; I used top round, but rump roast or chuck steak would be just as good. You can also control the fat content.",

I added 1/2 Lb of spicy Italian sausage a bay leaf and some diced portobellos. I did not add any red pepper since the sausage would add the spice. To account for the extra meat I added a few extra ounces of pasta sauce. I will be making this again in the future.",
