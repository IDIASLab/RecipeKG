I did make some alterations based on the ingredients I had. I replaced the mango with fresh chopped tomatoes didn't use any parsley used all fresh cilantro only used red onion and added celery as well as the jalepenos. I used about the same ratio of limes and lemons slightly more lime juice. Added a little olive oil no tequila but still may add that sounds good. Also added a little bit of lite coconut milk some of the best ceviche I ever had was in Colombia where they added coconut milk very tasty. Again great recipe it covers all the basics for a good traditional ceviche. Buen apetito!",
