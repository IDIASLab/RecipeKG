I used fresh mushrooms red and green pepper no peas (oldest daugher doesn't care for them) and once the vegies were tender I then added the flour to make a roux. I used one cup of skim milk one cup of fat free half and half and a half cup of chicken stock. I seasoned quite a bit more than suggested and added a little more sherry than stated. I bought a couple of tubes of Pillsbury Italian bread and made four bread bowls to hold and serve the chicken. kids and hubby got a kick out of it and devoured this dish. Thanks Diana!",

First I didn't use celery because Mom never did when she made this and I left out the peas since my hubby is allergic to them! I also left out the egg yolks because a lot of reviewers said the sauce was too thick and without them it was perfect! The sherry is a requirement in this and for those reveiwers that said it gave the dish a bad taste- they probably used the cooking sherry you buy at the grocery store! NEVER use the wines from the grocery store- only use what you what put in a glass! Yummy comforting dish!",
