I like the way it lightened up my potatoes and gave it a nice (yet not overpowering) earthy taste. Viva la kohlrabi!",

I agree that you should boil the kohlrabi a few minutes before adding the potatoes (5 sounds good) or those pieces remain a bit crunchy and hard to mash. I added garlic powder (instead of garlic scapes) lite sour cream olive oil spread sea salt and lactose free milk...mashed like crazy and served. Tasted yummy. This was our first time eating kohlrabi and I'm not disappointed:)",

I also FINELY CHOPPED THE KOHLRABI LEAVES (stems removed) because they have significantly MORE NUTRIENTS than the bulb itself. After cooking the potatoes and kohlrabi I added the leaves with the potatoes and kohlrabi pieces to the blender (easier than mashing or food processor - I have an unusual blender\u2026). Blended it all together with a tablespoon of MELT, put it in agreased little crock dish, covered with a little layer of fresh chopped parsley and then  spread over that a layer of shredded pepper jack (just what I had on hand but could easily be a multitude of cheese options, or something vegan - will ponder that..) and baked for a bit till the cheese had a brown light crisp - about 425 for 15 mins. Added a little salt to taste in my bowl and was AMAZING!! It was the first time I've even done anything with kohlrabi so it was a great experience. I plan on tweaking this to be vegan to take to Thanksgiving for me and my uncle and his gf. :) STEAM!!! ADD CHOPPED LEAVES!!!",
