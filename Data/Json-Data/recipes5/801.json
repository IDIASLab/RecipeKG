At first, I thought I was going to add some sort of cream base, but the soup ended up not needing it. The vegetables just taste lovely as they are. Even my husband who hates soup and asparagus LOVED this!  It is also a great way to use almost-expired vegetables in your veggie drawer!",

I had red potatoes, asparagus, and homemade chicken stick to use up, and used a teaspoon of Chicken Better Than Bullion paste to boost flavor, rather than a cube.  I used a potato masher rather than food processor which was easy enough if you like some pieces rather than all pureed. Thankful for this recipe find!",
