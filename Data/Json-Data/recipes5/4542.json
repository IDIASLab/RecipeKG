It ended up more like fettuccine with meat sauce then a soup. Overall very good and worth making for sure. Thanks for sharing.",

I chose this because we have a huge jug of tomato juice leftover from Thanksgiving. Instead of fettucine I used farfalle (bowties). I was nervous about all of the soups I was making tasting the same (again all tomato juiuce-based) so to this one I added extra lemon juice - maybe 2-3 times as much - and frozen corn kernels. I could have added more dill too. I also stirred in a teaspoon or so of paprika and of cumin. This was spicy and bright with lemon and really good! My husband added a little parmesan to his second helping but said that it made it taste too \"mac and beef\"-like and he preferred it without the cheese topping. I agree!",
