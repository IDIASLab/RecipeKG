I came across this recipe and decided that this would be a healthier alternative to the traditional egg rich kaya. I used low cholesterol coconut cream which made my kaya 98% cholesterol free. I also reduced the cooking time by more than half as I felt that the cooked pumpkin was soft enough and I used thicker coconut cream. That way I hoped to keep most of the nutrients in the pumpkin. This is a great vegan alternative to the usual kaya and is much healthier without compromising taste. 5 starsll the way!",

Few changes I made were to use coconut essence and skim evaporated milk instead to lower cholesterol and fat I also replaced the sugar with splenda. This caused less \"stiffening\" as expected I shall add a bit of sugar instead next time. Another thing I did was I boiled and mash the pumpkin instead of steam and blend. Bliss it tasted sinful. thanks great idea by the way!",
