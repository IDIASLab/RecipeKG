Sorry to those who don't like this but low/reduced or fat free mayo will RUIN this. It doesn't add the right zip but rather a sweetness that is icky. ANYWAY! I made this for supper when we were down to the dregs before grocery shopping. Only changes made: out of lemon so used pepperoncini juice which is a decent substitute and added egg noodles cooked al dente. Yummy yummy!",
