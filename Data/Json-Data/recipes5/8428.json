I agree it needs sweetener so I added 1 1/2 Tbsp Splenda and that did the job perfectly (as would the same amount of sugar I presume). I also just used pumpkin pie spice instead of all the separate spices and I used approximately double (about 2 tsp for the whole recipe). It turned out pretty good and my mom who doesn't like anything out of the ordinary really enjoyed it as well.",

If you half the milk and double the ice cream it gives it that perfect sweetness that doesn't require additional sugar. I also substituted allspice for the mace (I didn't have any mace on hand). I also halved the recipe in order to have it serve me my husband and my 3 kids (5 servings). It made 2 adult servings (about 1 3/4 c) and one 8oz child serving. While the full recipe might be too much it doesn't serve 10 good-sized milkshakes. It will make 10 8 oz shakes.",
