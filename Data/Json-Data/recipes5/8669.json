I browned my chicken in my instant pot and sprinkled lemon pepper, salt, paprika and garlic powder on each side as it was browning.  Once browned I added my chicken broth as recipe listed and since I wanted this to be a full meal in one pot I added two med. size onions, cut in wedges, several peeled potatoes also cut to be about the size of new potatoes and 4 carrots peeled and cut in large bite size pieces.  I sprinkled salt and pepper on my veggies then tossed them before adding to my pot and sprinkled some parsley flakes just for looks.  I set my instant pot for 25 minutes and once done I let the pressure release on it's own since my pot was pretty full and to give a little more time under pressure to make sure all my veggies were done.  Wonderful one pot meal.  Will be making again.  Thanks for sharing!",

First time followed directions exactly, second time did the same and tried to crisp the skin up in the oven afterwards - sadly, still disappointed.  This is a great recipe if you\u2019re not planning to serve the chicken as the meal\u2019s centerpiece or your oven\u2019s too dirty to handle an hour at 450\u00b0, but if you are serving the bird as the main dish, standing alone... Stupid Simple Roast Chicken is a lot easier and (not including rest time) takes the same amount of time to cook (1 hr) once you add in saut\u00e9ing, pressuring up, natural release, etc. and makes a much prettier centerpiece. (Trick to Stupid Simple Chicken - dry completely before roasting.)  This recipe is a great complement for a main course chicken dish that doesn\u2019t require skin and makes an amazing broth for gravy - but really, save your instant pot for the sides.",
