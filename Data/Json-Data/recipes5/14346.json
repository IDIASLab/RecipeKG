I omitted the broth and used chicken and tomato bouillon cubes. I still had a very rich, deep flavored soup. I added 1/2 cup each celery, carrots and tomato, just because 1. I needed to use them up, 2. I thought this soup needed some veggies, and 3. I like those veggies in chicken based soups. I didn't make the rice - I had regular steamed rice already. Lastly, I added a squeeze of lemon to bring out all the flavors. Excellent!! My husband, who isn't big on soups even liked this one. Will make again and again. Thank you for the recipe.",

Everything is to your preference and the end product is amazing! So glad I ran across this recipe, I was very intimidated to try and make a chicken soup, but this recipe really helped me! Thanks!!",
