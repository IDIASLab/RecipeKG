First, transfer your popcorn into a blow and then to another, leaving all of the unpoped kernels at the bottom of the first bowl. Toss the unpoped kernels. Return popcorn to bowl. This takes less than a minute and saves you a lot of time later (you don't have to find the unpoped kernels stuck in caramel!) When my caramel mixture was ready, I poured it unto the popcorn and tossed the caramel eavenly in the bowl to make sure the popcorn got evenly coated. Then, I transfered the coated popcorn into the brown paper bag. Depending on your microwave, it might be smart to cook it only 30 sec. at a time or to reduce the power because the first time I made it it burned. I cooked mine for 1:30 minutes (30 sec. at a time) at a reduced 50% power and it turned out perfectly.\nNote: For dairy-free version, replace the butter with 1/2 cup of Safflower oil.",

                "reviewBody": "First of all, this popcorn turned out great.  It was easy to make, and the cleanup was a snap.  I made this recipe using 2 bags of microwave popcorn.  The box said that each bag was 12 cups popped, but when I measured it after popping it, it was actually 8 cups per bag.  This made 2 bags perfect for this recipe (4 quarts exactly).  I did not have any paper bags to toss the popcorn in (who does anymore?), so I used the empty microwave popcorn bags instead!  Since they are made to fit 12 cups of popped popcorn, and they actually only popped 8, there was enough room in each bag to fit half of the caramel popcorn back into each one for the second part of the recipe.   The whole process was like this: pop the popcorn, pour both bags into a large bowl, dump it into another large bowl and remove the un-popped kernels from the bottom.  Split the popcorn in half (half in each bowl), cook the ingredients for the caramel as directed in the recipe, pour half of the caramel onto the popcorn in each bowl, mix the caramel into the popcorn using a couple of large spoons, pour each bowl of popcorn into its own empty microwave popcorn bag, and then microwave each popcorn bag individually as directed.  My microwave is high-powered, so I did 1 minute at 50% power, then shook the bag, then did another minute at 50% power.  It worked great!  Since microwave popcorn bags are wax-lined, the caramel didn't stick to them at all, and everything worked out great!",

This was so easy and quick and tastes just as good (if not better) than traditional. Couple of notes though: First, real butter is so much better and worth the extra cost because you can really taste the difference. Second, my butter/brown sugar mix boiled over in the m/w and made a big sticky mess which I then had to put the bag on, so I suggest you put a plate under the bowl to catch any mess. Third, I used m/w popcorn, I just omitted the salt and ate some while the butter/sugar mix was cooking. My bag says that each bag makes 10 cups, so it's about 4 cups too much. I used two bags (most of two bags, anyway) Terrific recipe, LOVE IT. Thanks.",

It smelt burnt although it didn't appear to be that way and it never got evenly spread in the paper bag with the popcorn in it; I don't recommend this recipe OR just follow your intuition on when the caramel should be ready and find a different way to evenly coat the popcorn in the caramel.",
