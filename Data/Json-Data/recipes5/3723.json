I have also used both stone ground and Dijon and it works well either way. For the bread crumbs I always used ritz type crackers and add classic Italian herbs and grated Parmesan. Which I believe make the best coating. The last suggestion I have is to make cuts into the chicken just over half way through the breast and add minced garlic into the slices. It add a nice flavor and keeps the chicken incredibly moist. Oh yeah and I also leave out the lemon juice because I rarely like the flavor.",

I pretty much stuck to the recipe with the exception of the following: Used unseasoned panko crumbs Olivio instead of butter and I baked it for 30 minutes on 425 degrees. I also removed the foil for the last 7 minutes of cooking to crisp it up. Topped with a pinch of locatelli romano which I also mixed about 2 tablespoons in with the panko. It was so delicious I will be making this again. Low calorie too! Served with roasted asparagus spears and brown n' serve rolls for the man in the house. Excellent! In a later version of this I put fresh mushrooms in the dish and let them bake with the chicken. Oh my! This recipe is now a weekly favorite at mi casa!",
