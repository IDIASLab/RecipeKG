The next time I would press the garlic rather than mince it so that it would make a better paste on the meat.  At 425 degrees it took about 23 minutes after I'd taken the meat from the fridge about a half hour before baking it.  At the very end I turned on the broiler to make the color a little better.  This is a very easy and very tasty meal.  Thanks for our dinner tonight!",

I had no Rosemary on hand, but I DID have \"italian seasoning\" which included rosemary, oregano and thyme-which thyme was recommended as a substitute for rosemary. Well since I had NO thyme using the Italian seasoning as the rosemary worked out perfextly \n\nI cooked it 25 minutes and was slightly pink inside and crusty beown on the outside. I wanted to include a picture though not flattering    but i am technically challenged! I definitely will make this a regular for us!?",
