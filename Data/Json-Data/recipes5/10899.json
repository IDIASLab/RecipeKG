Using the blender gave a more even coating of spices (especially the chili flakes). Perfect marinade.  Use any chicken cut  you like, I've used thighs, and breasts both with skin on/off.  I frequently precook for dinner parties and this is a favorite.  I marinated the breasts overnight, grilled fast and hot and load everything into an electric skillet.  Then I boiled the marinade, added chicken stock, then it is just heat and eat for tender, flavorful chicken with a grilled flavor but less work at party time.  Today I'll serve this with a greek salad, greek yogurt on the side (as a dip), good bread and wine.  Viola'",

I froze half of it to use later on salads, pita bread (gyros), etc.  The only slight difference was I used half oregano and half majoram.  I think I must have read that on his website.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and thighs because that's all I had on hand and it still turned out beautifully. I only had 3 1/2 hours to marinate but that was plenty of time for the cuts I used. Something in the marinade gave a wonderful crusted chicken effect - don't know why but it was great. I served it with the chopped salad Chef John suggests in his video. I added a bit of chopped cilantro and sprinkled it with some feta cheese. Made quite a hit. So simple.....I'll be making this often.",
