I use canned mandarin oranges (no sugar added) and the red/white grapefruit you can get in a jar (refrigerated). It's so much easier than trying to cut out the sections from the whole fruit! \n\nI use a little less butter, and a mix of brown sugar and sugar substitute. To top it off I add a few tablespoons of chopped pecans! Wonderful and only 3 points for a 1/2 cup serving! Great warm as is or as a topping on low fat frozen vanilla yogurt!",
