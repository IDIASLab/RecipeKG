I did intend to make one quart, but ended up with enough veggies for two. My only changes were to sub celery for squash and add a tablespoon of sugar.  Oh, and I didn't use the grapeseed oil (didn't have any on hand). I actually didn't have enough olive oil, so had to add vegetable oil to make up the difference. I just joined Misfits Market (highly recommend!), and had a huge beautiful head of cauliflower to use, plus lovely carrots and celery, all organic. So glad I found this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!",
