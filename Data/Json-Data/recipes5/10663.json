I grilled some large marinated shrimp on skewers for a birthday party at the park yesterday and I needed to make a dip to compliment the shrimp. The result was fabulous and the tastes are definitely heightened by using the mortar and pestle approach. Everyone raved at the unique combination of tastes which kind of unfold as you chew. The only very slight change that I made was to add lemon zest and to cut back slightly on the lemon juice. EXCELLENT recipe!!",
