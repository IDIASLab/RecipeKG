Raw chicken on the bone should take no more than 45 minutes - 1 hour to cook while braising.  2 - 3 hours is way too much, and it calls for the chicken to be browned first.  I give every new recipe the benefit of the doubt, and I followed the instructions.  I went with 2 hours.  As I expected, the chicken was basically mush by the end.  The picture that accompanies this recipe is 100% misleading.  And 3 cups of water?  Way too much.  This came out like chicken soup.  It would have been WAYYY richer and superior texture-wise to cook the shallots and make a masala with the spices.  Then add only coconut milk (no water at all) and let that simmer for 10 minutes.   Brown the chicken separately and then add it into the coconut milk mixture to simmer for 10 - 15 minutes.  This wasted about 4 hours of my time and some of my $.",
