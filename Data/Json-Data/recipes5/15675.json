I used \"Taco Seasoning II\" from this site and Ortega's Thick and Chunky Salsa. I sauteed about 1/4 cup of onion along with the ground beef. After the \"pizza\" cooled a bit I topped it with all the \"taco\" toppings to make it nice and pretty: shredded lettuce chopped de-seeded tomatoes sliced black olives thin sliced green onion and a few well placed dollups of sour cream and homemade guacamole! The leftovers are phenomenal too that is is you have any!",

To make it a little lighter (and to save a little money) I use ground chicken or turkey I make my own taco seasoning and I use tomato juice instead of water. My family likes a thin layer of sour cream so I spread that over the refried bean layer. Right after the meat layer I like to add a layer of shredded lettuce and chopped roma tomatoes. For the crust using a cooked crescent roll dough works too. They even make the new seamless sheets especially for pizza dough-type recipes. NOTE: If you like a good cool summer meal bake the dough for this in the early morning before it gets too hot and cool it. An hour before dinner make your taco meat and assemble your pizza then let it chill in the fridge until dinner. This is good hot but I'm sure you'll find that it's just as good cold too!",
