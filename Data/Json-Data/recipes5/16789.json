I would recommend you let them cool on the sheet a minute before removing them so your gingerbread people don't end up missing limbs:) p.s. I only chilled them about 1/2 hour and they were fine.

I am not a cut-out-cookie kind of person so I was reluctant to try one but my teenaged daughters boyfriend requested gingerbread cookies so we decided to try. This one is great! Rolled out really easily easy to handle and the flavor was great. Interestingly the ingredients call for butter and corn syrup and the recipe says molasses and margarine... we went for the latter skipped the cloves (didnt have any) and doubled up on the cinnamon and ginger- and it was great! Only chilled it for about 30 min and between batches and it rolled out fine. Will absolutely make these again.",
