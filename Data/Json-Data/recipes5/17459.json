Cut the rolls into 4-5 pieces each dredge through the brown sugar/cinnamon/pudding mixture and place on top of the nuts in the pan. After I pour the rest of the dry mixture over the rolls and pour the melted butter over all. I cover with foil and place in the fridge overnight. In the morning I place the uncovered pan in a cold oven then I turn the oven on to 350 and set the timer for 40 minutes. Great every time!

They were the most beautiful and delicious sticky buns that I have ever had and without a doubt the easiest recipe I have ever followed. I didn't have quite a full pkg. of frozen dough but had about half and it still turned out beautifully. I would highly reccomend this recipe to anyone and I will be using it again and again.

                "reviewBody": "These are great caramel rolls but I believe the recipe directions are wrong. What I do is thaw out two loaves of frozen bread dough and I do not let it rise. The first loaf I tear up in pieces and drop helter skelter in a 9/13 inch pan that is well greased. I then use a hand mixer to mix all the ingredients except the brown sugar  smooth. I also use cook and serve pudding and regular butter. Do not use the instant!  It will turn out clumpy! After mixing I pour it over the dough. Then I take the second loaf and tear that up and drop that on top of the dough and pudding mixture. Then I take the brown sugar and sprinkle it over the pan of rolls. The little that stick to the top of the rolls will make a nice glaze and will also keep the moisture in the bread. Then I let it double in size and bake for 30 min. on 375. The last 10 min place foil over them so they do not get too brown or burn. When they are done line a cookie sheet with foil and put wax paper on top. Spray the wax paper with oil and lay the cookie sheet with the foil and oil wax on top of the pan and flip over. Let sit for a few minutes to let the caramel drizzle in the rolls then carefully remove the pan! Voila! Perfect caramel rolls! I am positive that to just dump the pudding on top will make it clumpy so always mix first with the butter and cinnamon. My mom has made these since I was little and now my family loves them as well!  In fact I just put a pan in the oven to rise! Everyone I know loves these rolls!",

I don't understand how anyone could have a flop as I have never had one and it's so darn easy! Make sure you use enough melted butter. I do a couple things differently but I don't think it should make too much of a difference. I use 18 Rhodes frozen rolls. I think cutting them in half is a good idea as the rolls can be quiet large and messy to eat...but that's the fun of it. I spray plastic wrap with Pam and cover the rolls over night. I never refriderate them...I don't see how they would rise that way. In the morning I have a beautiful over-flowing bundt pan. Bake and viola perfection! I do suggest covering the pan with foil the last half of baking as the outer rolls get more dried out. Definitely use a large plate as the nut mixture accumulates on the bottom of the pan and then slides down the sides once the pan is inverted. This is a tradition on Christmas/Easter morning and a hit every single time.",
