I left it in the fridge overnight and it was VERY easy to work with the next day. The next time I made 4 batches with different flavors for gifts but only had time to refrigerate them a few hours. The chocolate was too gooey to cut and had to be shaped. Very time consuming and I lost a lot of precious chocolate due to the sticky mess but the effort was still worth the delicious results. Love the recipe and will make them again - just a day ahead so they firm up. FAST EASY and DELICIOUS when done like the video.",
