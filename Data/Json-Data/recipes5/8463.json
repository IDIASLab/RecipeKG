The crispy meringue blends beautifully with the soft, gooey caramel and bananas and the fluffy whipped cream. YUM. I served this a little differently because there were just 3 of us and I didn't want the leftover meringue to get soggy. I cut the meringue into pie slices, spooned the bananas and caramel on each slice, and then topped with whipped cream and chopped chocolate. Oh boy. Straight to my fanny. :) Thanks for the recipe!",

This was my first experience with pavlova, and before I tried it I thought that the meringue part would be just kind of tasteless, but to those of you who don't know like I didn't, it is a rich, warm, toasty, delicious flavor!  Combined with the caramel and bananas, it becomes something absolutely fabulous that is sure to impress all guests!  I just made this for my family today, but next time we have guests over, I am making this! Thanks Trish, love it!",

I was sooo worried abt getting an eggy taste which sometimes happens with meringues and also because I tasted the pieces that I trimmed from the edges of this one to fit into the plate and after an hour or so started having that eggy smell to them. I don't know why that happens! However The dessert itself was wonderful with no egginess whatsoever! I did cut down the sugar to 3/4 of a cup because a whole cup seemed wayy to sweet. I am glad I did it was perfect like that! Also I used regular white vinegar and worked just fine. Thanks for sharing your great recipe!",

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and trace an 8 inch circle onto the surface. 2. In a metal or glass bowl whip the egg whites and salt until soft peaks form. (The salt helps break down the stickiness of the egg whites) 3. Gradually by tablespoon add the sugar while continuing beating until the mixture is stiff and shiny 4. Sprinkle the cornstarch & cream of tartar over the mixture add the vanilla and white wine vinegar and mix in for a further minute. 5. Mound the mixture into the traced circle on the baking sheet. Flatten the top and smooth the sides using a spatula. 6. Place in the preheated oven and immediately reduce the heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until a pale golden brown. Turn off the oven and leave the door slightly ajar with the pavlova inside until completely cooled. 7. Just before serving time invert the cooled pavlova onto a serving plate and top with slices of banana. Cover banana with caramel sauce. Top that with whipped cream and sprinkle with grated chocolate. It should also mention in the ingredient list that the eggs should be at room temperature (this maximises the eggs whites ability to whip up properly) Its also normal for the \"meringue to crack\" once cooled but when you have the toppings on you wont even notice!

I followed the directions exactly using room temp egg whites and they whipped to great volumes. My problem was with forming the shell. After doing a little research I only spread the egg whites to within an inch of the circle lines and baked as directed. This turned out great. The first one I baked I spread out the full diameter of the circle upon baking it expanded and made a flatter shell that cracked alot. Once you get this part done it is so easy to complete. This is fabulous!! Very sweet but oh so good!! It looked absolutley beautiful on the serving plate. Next time I will add more bananas because we love bananas and they go so well with this. There were no leftovers. Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

Next time I would leave off the caramel altogether or make my own from scratch.. too sweet from a jar. As a side note regular white vinegar is just fine.. I've never used white wine vinegar and I've made dozens of Pavlova's.",
