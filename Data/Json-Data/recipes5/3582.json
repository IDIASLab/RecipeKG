My dinner party loved the tartar sauce! Even a non-tartar-sauce person loved it! It had a nice tangy and slightly sweet taste from the lemon and bread and butter pickles and I think the tarragon just rounds it out so nicely. It made the dinner I think! I made the recipe as 22 servings but it served my party of 8 with maybe 2 servings left. Like I said they loved it. If I ever have the capers I'll have to try it that way too. Thank you for the tasty sauce recipe!",

Until we went tpo a ling o ttle whole-in-the-wall restaurant that had homemade tartar sauce with tarragon-- I flipped. It was really good. So trying to recreate it I found this recipe. I did do some tweaking-- had fresh tarragon and some extra left over basil and tyme leaves from a marinade I was doing... Used sweet gherkins and capers but then ran everything through a food processor before whisking it into a mix of 1/2 cup mayonaise and 1/2 cup of lite sour cream (El Esposo is trying to lose some weight). ERMAGAWD. This is good stuff folks! (I think I may try to sneak some plain yogurt in there next time!) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS!!!",

Edit: After finally getting tarragon to make this the right way I've concluded I prefer it without the tarragon. Dill and oregano are better. Other reviews as far back as 2012 agree.
