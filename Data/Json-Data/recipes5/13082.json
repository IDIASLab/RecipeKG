I was able to use one onion one red pepper one can diced tomatoes and slightly less than one bottle of BBQ sauce for both (big) pizzas. I skipped the mushrooms and added fresh chopped cilantro to the top before baking. I baked at 375 for approximately 17 minutes. With these modifications this turned out really well and will probably make a reappearance in my dinner rotation. I loved the addition of the chopped tomatoes in this. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",
