But it IS a similar taste and the texture is good too. It was tender and delicious. IF your favorite way to eat lobster is diped in melted butter and IF it is a treat that you simply can't afford very often I think you will thoroughly enjoy this recipe as a substitute. With boneless chicken breasts on sale so often this is absolutely a perfect way to serve them. We cooked them on a grill and just until done which was about 20 minutes as the recipe said turning them often. I think the smokey flavor helped. We marinated the chicken only about two hours-- next time I might marinate over night. EVEN if you just think this tastes like chicken it is EXCELLENT chicken. I would absolutely recommend it and absolutely recommend savoring each bite dripping with melted butter. YUM. Thanks to the person who posted this!",

I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. The only thing I did that wasn't stipulated in the recipe was give the chicken breasts a bit of a pounding to further tenderize before marinating but not enough to flatten. The descriptive words that were passed around the table were: MMMMM Delicious Soooo tender & juicy WOW thats fantastic don't lose that recipe. I discovered that a tin of pineapple tidbits has just the required 1/2 cup of pineapple juice in it (so I didn't have to go out to buy the juice) and I used the pineapple tidbits in a dessert.",

Works great on kebabs too! UPDATE: just want to say that I use this recipe all the time and it always turns out scrumptious. Tonight it was blsl thighs and bone in drumsticks. DBF asked if I had put bacon in the marinade:D heehee! I did make one sub this time; used the juice from a jar of Dole tropical fruit in juice instead of straight up pineapple juice.",

Depending on how much chicken I am preparing depends on how much oil I add to the marinade. Overall I'm sure I use less. I used garlic powder and added no more salt to the recipe than is in the soy sauce. This is an EXCELLENT recipe. I've broiled it and am looking forward to grilling it this summer. When I take BLSL breasts out of the freezer I add the marinade to the frozen breasts and let it thaw in the marinade. Very tasty! The melted butter dip contributes to the \"illusion\" of lobster and is very good. But not necessary to enjoy this dish. Bon apetit!",

My only *complaint* is it was a bit salty (which is so weird for ME to say...Mr. LTH looked at me like I was nuts when I said that out loud)!; I think next time (yes, there WILL be a next time) I will use reduced sodium soy sauce.
