So I took the advice of other reviewers and added beef stock instead enough to submerge all the onions then continued following the recipe. The beef stock bumped it up to one star as it was earning none. I think to appreciate this soup you would have to be a wine connessoire and just finished your second glassful before eating it. Will not make this again but I am inspired to find a nice French onion soup recipe. Thanks anyway.",

We cut it down to two servings used dried parsley and added half a can of chicken broth. It tasted pretty good without the broth but we think it tasted a little better with it.
