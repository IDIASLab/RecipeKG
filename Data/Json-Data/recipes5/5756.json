As they are both vegetarian I try to find some new recipes to try when they are around. This was so good that I decided to use it for a dish at our wedding to offer something substantial for our vegetarian/vegan guests. I gave the recipe to our caterer and he made it leaving the goat cheese aside as a topping (a courtesy for the vegan crowd). It turned out pretty good except that he used GREEN peppers instead of red or orange! (Probably less expensive) Noooo... it s just not the same! You MUST use red or orange peppers. If I had tried this with green the first time I would not have been as impressed. The taste is just not right. This recipe is perfect as is. Don t change it.",
