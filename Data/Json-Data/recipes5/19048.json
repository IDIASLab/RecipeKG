I use regular brown rice in the meatballs, and use a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses in evaporated cane juice in place of the brown sugar.  I doubled this because I have a family of 11, and I usually think when it says \"serves 10\" they don't mean 10 of my kids!  In this case, though, the recipe is abundant.  I made it in a big Nesco roaster, and it was fabulous.  A few kids would have preferred it without raisins, but I think the flavor is important.  Fabulous recipe!  I am so thankful to have it! Update: My husband prefers that I just brown the ground beef with onion, and add about 2/3 cup of cooked rice. It makes this recipe much easier than the meatballs, and as a result we eat it more often! Still one of the greats, even years after I began making it.",
