It's really not that hard to make it the right way but a lot of people assume it is. First off, don't buy canned beans, that's just full of preservatives, salt and processed chemicals. To make refried beans just mash cooked (boiled beans) with a little oil for flavor along with salt. For the meat, don't add seasoning, just sautee garlic, onion, tomato and then add meat to pan to cook and then add each spice as you like. Guacamole does not have sour cream and it includes avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, lime, lime zest, jalapeno salt and pepper.  Also, tortillas for tacos should really be corn tortillas for the authentic Mexican taste. If you want hard shell tacos simply place meat in the tortilla and fry over a pan on each side until crispy. You can also make taquitos this way by wrapping tortilla like a flute and securing with a toothpick while frying. Finally, please use queso fresco, a moist crumbly Mexican cheese, you wont be sorry. Hope this helpas and motivates people to make homemade tacos the way a Mexican family would. =)",

I like mine with queso, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. My hubby likes lettuce, tomato, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream, and taco sauce on his.   Also, as it indicates in the ingredients list by specifying a size, it is quite important that you use the right size soft shells that fit the size of the hard shells so you don't have too much or too little outside coverage.
