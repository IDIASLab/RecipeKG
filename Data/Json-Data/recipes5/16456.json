I improvised by putting 1/2 cup of ketchup(instead of 1 cup), 1 1/2 teaspoons of soya sauce, 1 table spoon chilli powder, 1 table spoon garlic powder and a few shakes of hot sauce.  I gave this recipe a 3 because of the changes that needed to made. After all the changes, it tasted absolutely delicious. I've used this recipe to make wings, legs and thighs.  I will definitely using this recipe for making barbeque chicken in the future.",

I did change two things in the recipe however. Before coating the wings with the sauce I dropped them in boiling water for 10 minutes. I didn't have any onion powder so I substituted garlic powder. Also, I put aluminum foil on the pan before I put the wings in (makes clean up easier).",

These changes are for a doubled batch: added two tablespoons of garlic powder, added approx. 10 drops of hot sauce and added approx. 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  I also used only 1 1/2 cups of ketchup as other reviewers suggested.  Because some reviewers complained about burning I cooked them the first 30 minutes covered with foil and the last 15 minutes uncovered.  I also basted every 15 minutes.  This was a great recipe and I plan on making this many, many more times.",
