It is a fruit cake as we know them in Ireland and the UK; however I think it's a bit too sweet - a common failing in recipes adapted to the American taste I find. I've made this a few times now and find it best with only half a cup of sugar as the dried fruits add their own sweetness. You can use any dried fruits of your preference of course - apples apricots dates prunes figs - whatever you like.",
