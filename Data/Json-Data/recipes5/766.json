I think 4-6 is a more accurate number.\nI was rushed for time so I used southern style frozen has browns (the chunks, not shredded)and ham already cubed. (It comes vacuum packed in a zip bag) I think next time I might use frozen O'Brian potatoes and that way I won't have to mess with chopping the onions and peppers. I just threw the frozen potatoes in the butter with the ham, onions, and pepper and cooked them until they were thawed and warm. I cooked the carrots and celery in the microwave just a few minutes until they started getting tender. Talk about fast and easy! It was delicious too!",

I agree that if you have a big appetite this will feed about 4-6 adults and stirring the sauce into the potatoes helps get it distributed because it is pretty thick. Next time I will saute all my veggies and only boil the potatoes and some broccoli. The sauce was very cheesy (yum) but next time I will add a little nutmeg and some sour cream and use some parmesan too for a little more depth.",
