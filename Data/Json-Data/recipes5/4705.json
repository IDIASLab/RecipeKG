Upped garlic to 1 tblsp & used 1 green onion. I would use fresh herbs when available but the dry worked also. I cut recipe in 1/2 using 1 C wine with 1/4C lemon juice and 2 tblsp olive oil but kept herbs at original recipe quantities (I didn't bother adding whole peppercorns). I only needed enough for 2 chicken breasts. The extra (unused) I marinaded a smaller cut sirloin steak in. Both times I did overnight marinading and find the flavor profile versitile for different meats. Well I liked it plenty with my few minor adjustments. Tasty without being overbearing. Of course you can adjust flavors to you liking - Thanks for the post!",

I halved the recipe and it made too much for just 2 breasts so I marinated a pound of sliced mushrooms in part of it. I baked the chicken and sauteed the mushrooms over a pretty high heat. My husband and I liked the chicken but ironically the mushrooms tasted better than the chicken! Next time I'll at least double the garlic and the onion. I think those two will give it a much more rounded and deep flavor.",

Even a very inexpensive wine is better than cooking wine. If you are worried about waste because you don't drink wine consider this you are using more than half of the bottle in this recipe. This was a last minute Sunday night scramble for me. I didn't have any fresh herbs so I used all dried. I don't care for basil and thyme together so I switched the basil for rosemary. I did have fresh garlic and lemons. I only had two hours for the chicken to marinade so I pounded them 3/4 inch thick. I really had my doubts (because of all my changes not the recipe) but it was terrific. I can't wait to try it again with fresh herbs with a nice long marinade!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!",
