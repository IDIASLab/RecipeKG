The panko crisps up beautifully, and the halibut is tender, moist, and delicately-flavored. This was inspired, in part, by several Weight Watchers&reg; recipes; I don't know the calories or points exactly, but it's a very simple lean and low-calorie dinner. It pairs well with roasted or stuffed tomatoes (can cook at the same temperature!) and a salad. Serve with lemon wedges.",

Nice and cripsy crust with a moist and flaky inside.

Very good and will definitely be making it again!:-)",

Everyone loved it and were looking for more. Served with roasted sweet potato and asparagus for my wife, son and daughter-in-law. We enjoyed it so much that my wife asked for a repeat two nights later (with sauteed Swiss Chard from garden). My halibut portions were larger, very fresh and quite thick and I had them in the oven for about 15 minutes (overcooked halibut makes everyone sad!). Keep an extra close watch if dealing with thinner fish.",
