For 2 cans that's equivalent to 3/4 cup liquid - some of that should be water or it'll be VERY lemony. (I personally don't like using the liquid from canned beans bec. it's slimy.) Halving the quantity of garlic would probably suit most people; add full amount if you want it to be very garlicky. For adherence to traditionally authentic ingreds. this gets 4 stars. 2 is between 1 & 4 so 2 stars is what I rate it. (The red pepper flakes aren't traditional though are a nice change from mild paprika. If using garbanzos cooked from dry then adding some of that cooking water to achieve smooth puree is probably a good idea I think.)",
