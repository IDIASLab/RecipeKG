During a visit a few years ago, after missing her cooking desperately, I watched her prepare it and jotted down the recipe. (Don't worry, I checked with my mom and she's totally on board with sharing with you!) Serve on a bed of fresh spinach with a side of refried beans. Garnish with fresh diced tomatoes, green onions, cheese, avocado slices, and crushed chile flakes.",
