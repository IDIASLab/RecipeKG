However, it had to be something simple because I didn't have much else. \r\n\r\nI found this recipe and gave it a try. In all honesty I did stray from Erin's true recipe, but its close enough to say it was a GREAT basis to start with. I added some extra virgin olive oil (rather than the bean liquid) and salt. Instead of garlic cloves I subsituted 3 tsp of granulated garlic. Instead of the jalapeno, I added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper. After blending it all, I tasted it, and added a few shakes of spice as necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso, its a good idea to cover this with plastic wrap and then allow it to sit in the fridge for at least an hour so that all the flavors can mellow and mix together!",

I served it with pita chips yesterday at my Superbowl party for those of us who want a healthier alternative to chips and dip. This was a great recipe and I will definitely be making it again and again. It's so much cheaper and better than store bought hummus.",

I also added a splash of olive oil and more of the bean liquid to smooth out the hummus. It would have been a bit too think without it.
