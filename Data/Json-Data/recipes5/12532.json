After saut\u00e9ing the shrimp in the remaining bacon grease PLEASE remove the shrimp from the skillet and then cook your veggies otherwise they ll be TOTALLY overcooked. Finally for sake of presentation do NOT mix everything together at the end simply spoon on the shrimp bacon and veggies to the grits and serve. Shrimp and grits has lovely presentation and you ll really screw it up by mixing everything together. Deducting a star for the above comments but you can feel comfortable that this recipe will turn out well. It tastes good we enjoyed it!",
