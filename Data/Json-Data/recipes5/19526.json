For added tang and zip I splashed in about a Tbls of apple cider vinegar not sure if it changed it much but it had a nice tang to it. I used boneless chicken thighs and then shredded it for soft tacos it was so tender. My teenage son loved it and said it could even be spicier so next time I may just go for the whole Tbls!

I used Rosarita- salsa taquera which is as authentic as you can get from the store (in my opinion) Now the salsa you want to use is not the same kind you use to dip your chips in. This is more of a taco sauce the kind where you can see all the seeds from the ground up chili peppers. (hope you all know what im talking about;) My salsa was very hot so i reduced the amount of cayenne by more than half and im glad i did. This was very good! I basted frequently and broiled for the last 5 mins or so. Delicious!",

So we used a coupla 1/2 bottles of hot sauce plus some some homemade thai pepper hot sauce. We skinned our chicken leg quarters basted them shortly after removing foil cover w/ sauce from bottom of dish (thickening nicely). Our 4 leg quarters were big so we doubled the sauce but only used 2 tablespoons of cayenne for sauce used 4 tablespoons of brown sugar. Next time will use a bit more cayenne and less brown sugar. We steamed some brown rice and there was enough left over to make lunchbox burritos and taco dinner the next day.",

Besides who actually eats 1 chicken thigh for dinner? Our chicken was still red and bleeding near the bone. Cook for an hour at 400.
