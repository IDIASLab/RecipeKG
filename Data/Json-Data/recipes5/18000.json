I halved the recipe and did some substitutions due to lack of ingredients: I cut out the germ dates and coconut and I added 1/2 cup of flour 1/2 cup bran cereal (looks like twigs) and 1/2 cup of sliced almonds. This cereal is barely sweet so I added some raisins to my bowl when I served it. I'll definitely be making this again!",

Everyone I've given it to has beeged for the recipe. My boys put it on yogurt or applesauce and I just love it in a bowl with milk for breakfast. When making it I include the optional cinnamon and nutmeg but I also include - 1 cup of flax seeds. I sometimes splurge on the vanilla too and add up to 2 tablespoons. As for the nuts I have found that I like chopped hazelnuts and almonds. I cook the nuts throughout the entire baking cycle to give them a nice toasted taste. Then I just add the dates for the last 15 minutes and skip the coconut. Super easy! Super good!",

For my youngest's food allergies I substituted oat bran for wheat bran ground up sunflower seeds for the wheat germ (an odd-sounding substitution but it worked) and about 1/4 cup barley malt instead of brown sugar (I decreased the water a bit to make up for the liquid). This goes great with rice oat or almond milk--and if you use just enough milk to cover the cereal and microwave it for about 60 seconds it makes a wonderful hot cereal (really brings out the pecan flavor).",
