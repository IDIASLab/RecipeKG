I thought this was sweet but very good but maybe too sweet for a salad. So then I mixed it with items that weren't sweet--arugula red onion feta and then blueberries too. That worked very well. The vinegar I used was some I made from this site--Raspberry Vinegar II--and it had sugar in it so that may be part of my problem. The bottom line is that I will try this recipe again using a different kind of puree---maybe what you can get from a liquor store that is used in either alcohol or non-alcohol drinks. I WILL be trying this again! Thanks Chef Ricky!",
