I was completely blown away by the flavor and couldn't believe I cooked them.  Even cutting each rib was awesome.  The sound the knife made as it cut through the juicy meat, you just knew they were cooked to perfection.\n\nI mostly followed the recipe to a T, but had twice the ribs and only 1/2 the ketchup.  So I made up the batch of sauce, which was runny like a marinade. I also mixed in a small amount of Famous Dave's Devil's Spit.  Covered with foil and baked at around 350 for about 3 hours.  Every 30 minutes I came back in an flipped them and poured a little Devil's Spit on or basted with homemade sauce.  After about 2 hours I took away the foil.  After removing the foil and waiting another 30 minutes, the ribs were really starting to look awesome. By the time I was done I used an entire bottle of Devil's Spit and about 3/4ths of the sauce (which started to thicken, but was still liquidy, had to drain pan).\n\nThese ribs were so juicy, so tender.  I got a lot of compliments, and with the Devil's Spit used (which only helped to enhance the original recipe), they had a little spice/heat to them.  But even two little kids who don't like spicy food were eating them.  Quite possibly the best dish I've ever cooked!\n",

It may be a little putzy to tend to them every 20 minutes for 3 hours, but it is so worth it. Who would think ketchup, water and a few other simple ingredients could produce such a luxurious sauce? Other than adding a little garlic powder and 2 tsp. of liquid smoke I made these just as the submitter intended. Every time I pulled them out of the oven to baste them they just kept looking better and better! Absolutely beautiful and finger-lickin' good.",

I quickly seared the ribs on a baking sheet before basting on the meat-side only and was fairly carful about applying sauce every 20 minutes.  I never flipped my ribs and only basted the meat-side.  I baked them for approx 2 1/2hrs at 350, then turned off the oven for about 40 minutes - after which, I warmed the ribs at 170F for about 10 minutes before serving.\n\nThe amount of sauce was right on for my taste, and I wouldn't change the recipe next time as I think it was perfect.",
