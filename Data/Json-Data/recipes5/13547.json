These are a wonderful time-saver in the morning. I made them with regular eggs diced ham red peppers habenero shredded cheese and green onions. In the time it takes to toast an English muffin I've got a great breakfast!!! Love it! I tried to make them in muffin liners for my first batch to save on clean-up time - don't!!! They are very difficult to peel out of the papers.",
