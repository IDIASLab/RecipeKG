And don't be a snob when it comes to frozen. Unless you buy it within 24 hours of catch, frozen is a better bet. Especially with tilapia, which is a farmed fish, and quick frozen immediatly after catch. Look for frozen fillets individually sealed for best taste, and thaw as instructed. Also, if you soak thawed fillets in milk for half an hour before cooking,(skim is fine) they will have a very fresh flavor.\n ",

By poaching the tilapia in white wine/veggie stock/lemon juice with the chopped sundried tomatoes, olives, capers and garlic, the fish retains that wonderful Mediterranean flavor.  After the fish is done, just reduce the sauce and spoon over top.  I served this with a side of orzo.  Very good -- thanks for the inspiration!",

I also added the mixture of tomatoes capers and feta about 2 minutes before the fillets were done which I believe helped mix/melt the flavors together a bit. I also cooked it in a dish with a cover. One caveat: Although a great flavor I probably wouldn't do this recipe if I had purchased fresh fillets. I would instead do something a bit more delicate to emphasize the flavor of the fish a bit more. (I generally think of frozen fish as a base for flavor not as the star flavor.) But since I had frozen fillets this was perfect! I would definitely do it again. I'm also thinking that next time I might make a bit extra topping then throw it on some sliced bread and toast it to serve as an appetizer while the fish is cooking. Yum!",
