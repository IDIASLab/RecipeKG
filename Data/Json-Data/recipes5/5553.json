However, for 2 people, 1+ teaspoon of salt and 1+ teaspoon of pepper sounds like quite a lot!  I wound up using much less--about 1/4 teaspoon of each was quite enough for us, on about 3/4 pound of asparagus.  In addition, I coated the asparagus with 1 tablespoon of olive oil before I placed it in the oven, and when done, I tossed it with only 1 tablespoon of lemon juice combined with 1 teaspoon of butter.  This was ample seasoning for our tastes.  Of course, more of any of the ingredients may be added, if desired.  Oh, and I only did 5 minutes under the broiler.  15 minutes would have turned my beautiful asparagus into crispy critters!",
