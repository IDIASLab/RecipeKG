I saut\u00e9ed the peppers and onions as directed and then instead of using chicken I used ground venison and seasoned it to taste. I followed the video and let the mixture cool and added the cheese before heating the tortillas and filling them. I apparently did not let my pan heat up enough before warming the tortillas as the later ones were easier to wrap than the first ones. Using egg white to seal the tortillas really helped! I was concerned that the filling would not be warm in just 12-15 minutes since I baked them several hours after I made the filling. However that did not seem to be a problem and they were warm all the way through. I wrapped a few of the leftover chimis and stuck them in the freezer. I am excited to have a quick yummy meal waiting for me next time I need it!",

This recipe is great for flavor, although I feel that there are few mistakes or shall I say time consuming steps in this process of preparing. I like to use chicken tenderloins because they cook faster. I broil the chicken until fully cooked as I am saut\u00e9ing whatever veggies I choose to use or have on hand. After everything is fully cooked and cool enough to handle, I shred the chicken in a bowl and mix all of my ingredients together as well as my cheese and a homemade version of salsa. The salsa and cheese bind all of the ingredients together. I stuff and roll the tortillas and shallow pan fry in oil until crispy and done. This cuts out the need to bake and you get to enjoy a little sooner!",
