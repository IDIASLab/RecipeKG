Yes, the tripe smells awful when cooking and one thing that helps a lot is adding 6-8 cloves of garlic and a lemon (cut in half and the juice squeezed in) in step one.  The garlic cooks and doesn't add a strong garlic flavor.  In step two, I would add broth in place of water and some cubed, sauted pork. This adds the hearty flavor that is missing when only tripe and water are used.  I also use pureed New Mexico red chili, adjust to your taste. I hope you enjoy my tried and true 'hints'.  ",

It came out way too spicy (& i love spicy food) so I had to drain some of the water and I blended up some dried Guajillo chiles I had on hand to give it some additional flavor and color since the color wasn't the true aunthentic version I'm familiar with. It was very watered down. My family enjoyed it but my husband (who raves about my cooking) didn't care for it at all. He said he prefers and loves the way I originally make it because it's tastier and has a more richer and redder color to the juice. I use a combination of chile California New Mexico and Guajillo in my own recipe. I think I'm gonna stick to my own version afterall.",
