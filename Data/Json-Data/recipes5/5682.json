I will definitely make it again because it's a good way to add more kale to my diet. I used chopped kale mixed with shredded cabbage and carrots.

I mixed the mayo with 1 pack of Truvia for a bit of sweetness and 2 tbsp red wine vinegar and mixed it all together with a splash of olive oil. Yum! It's so tangy and crunchy and good.",
