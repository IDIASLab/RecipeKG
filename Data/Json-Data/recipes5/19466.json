I had made eggs on the side and this meal was reminiscent of McDonald's McGriddles. I'll make this again. I served this with homemade pancake syrup also from this site.

Some of the cake stuck to the sides as well so I had to piece it back together and scrape out the bacon from the pan to set back on top. To hide my big mess I made a maple glaze. In a pan on medium heat cook 2 tbsp butter 1/4 cup maple syrup one cup of confectioners sugar. Whisk until smooth drizzle over the cake. It hid all my imperfections and tasted great!",
