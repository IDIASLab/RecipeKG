I did decrease the olive oil to 1 (one) tablespoon and decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and I can not imagine it tasting any better. I marinated it in a plastic bag and kind of massaged the oil mixture into the salmon and then left it for an hour. I may decrease the pepper a wee bit next time. For you fellow Weight Watchers I calculated the points for a 6 ounce fillet to be 8.5. ***That is the points using 1 tblsp. of oil for the 2 fillets.  Enjoy! Thanks Norma.",

We never got around to trying the others.  This has become a staple in our weekly menu. We don't use fillets, we use boneless salmon steaks instead (you'll need to bake for the full 45 mins. if you do too). I add two slices of lemon atop each salmon steak prior to closing up the packets.  Since we prefer to serve this over white rice (sounds odd but is delicious) we omit the parsley so that we're left with a bit of sauce after it's done baking which we then pour over and toss the rice in.  We place the rice on a plate, the salmon on top and serve with steamed broccoli all around.  Once a week every week and it's never gotten old.  I still look forward to it every week.",

I was worried there wouldn't be enough juice, but after cooking the salmon for 45 minutes, there was plenty of yummy juice!  It was a tad salty (and I love salty food!), so I might decrease the salt to 3/4 tsp next time.  I will definitely make this over and over again - I'm proud of myself for actually loving a salmon dish!  (UPDATE:  I have started using this same method for chicken breasts, and they come out amazing too!!  I love to serve it over brown rice...the juice gives the rice a nice flavor.)",

Use only 2 tablespoons and reduce the lemon accordingly if desired. 2) I used pressed grapeseed oil instead of olive oil and it was very light and added a buttery undertone that was nice. 3) I added 1/2 teaspoon of dill and was very glad I did. Next time I will add a full teaspoon. 4) I used half the salt and it was enough. 5) I marinated it only 1/2 an hour and it was plenty. You want to be able to taste the salmon! 6) I used 3 (8 ounce) fillets and baked in a small casserole dish with foil over the top, and a light coating of butter and lemon juice on the bottom. There was still enough marinate for the extra fillet. It worked very well except the marinate mix was about 1/2 inch deep after 20 minutes in the oven, hence the comment about too much oil. Overall an easy, low-mess marinate that I will make again with less oil.",

If you like your fish steamed rather than baked, this cooking method will work fine. I would have much preferred this simply baked, and maybe finished off by broiling for a few minutes at the end. This steaming method just did not appeal to me or my husband..almost too moist and definitely needing some richness and color that baking/broiling would have created.  Will try again but open roasted.",
