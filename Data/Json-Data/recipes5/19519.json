And yes, I have tried this method before I discovered the correct way to flavor my steaks. Buy a new spray bottle. Fill with 1/3 Worcestershire sauce, 1/3 whiskey or bourbon, 1/3 water, and a cap full of 'Liquid Smoke'. Shake to mix well. Key to BBQ'ing is too leave your steaks lay out to reach room temperature. Salt & pepper steaks. Place steaks on a HOT grill and intermittently spray mist the steaks with your mixture, even spraying the flames to create a smoke. Flip steaks ONLY once! Remove when desired temperature is met, and let steaks sit for 5 minutes before serving to let the juices settle. FYI, the Grand Champion of BBQ Pit Masters uses this mixture but includes 'Jack Daniels Whiskey'! Enjoy!",
