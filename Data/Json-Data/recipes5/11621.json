This melt-in-your-mouth braised beef dish is cold weather comfort food at its finest. Miso adds an extra savory element, balanced with a touch of maple syrup, which further enhances the autumnal feel. Serve over mashed potatoes, rice, or noodles.",

While some of the harder-to-find ingredients may scare off prospective cooks this recipe works fine with substitutions for things like the oil or mushrooms. In fact and I hesitate to admit this because Chef John will never be my friend now but I don't like maple syrup and used 'pancake' syrup. While the maply flavor probably adds something more I don't find myself missing anything. You can cut or omit the spicy ingredients to taste and I would advise going easy on the salt until you get to the end and are seasoning to taste as miso is quite salty on its own. Mashed potatoes are my favorite side to pair it with as they soak up all that incredible braising liquid! Some sauteed greens would probably go great too.",

I used salt sparingly as I felt the vegetable broth we substituted and miso paste contained a lot. We didn t have sake so used chardonnay to deglaze. Our chuck roast took close to three hours to tenderize so all together it took about 3.5 hours to complete. We left off the peppers and green onions at the end and did not miss them. Served with mashed potatoes. The sauce has a fabulous rich flavor and we will definitely make this again.",

I did not have yellow miso I instead used red since it gave it a deeper rich flavor I also substituted the chicken stock with rehydrated shiitake mushroom water and it brought the dish together. A tip is to have your pan on high bring your meat out thirty minutes before cooking so the splatter of the meat on the oil won't be so high also 3-4 minutes per side and use a cast iron skillet. Excellent recipe! can't wait to make it again!",
