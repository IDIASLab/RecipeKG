No cream of tartar so I just upped the baking powder to a tsp. and used a half tsp. of baking soda. I did combine the dry ingredients first wisked them to combine them and eliminate most lumps then combined the wet and gently stirred the batter until just combined. Because pancake batter using oats can be a little wet at first I let it sit for fifteen minutes while my griddle preheated and it was perfect. Good stuff! Next time I'd like to use butter real buttermilk instead of water and milk powder and add blueberries. NOTE: One batch of this recipe got me ten pancakes using my 1/3 c. measuring cup for even pancakes.",

The recipe says \"1 1/4 tsp divided\" but doesn't tell you what kind of division to do. I added the full 1 1/4 t. to the batch I made for my family and they turned out a little too salty. I scaled it back to 3/4 t. and that was MUCH better.",

I tried this initially to see if I liked it enough to give away and it was good but a bit too heavy for my taste. I changed the original recipe a bit... I used one cup of white flour(eliminating the wheat flour entirely) reduced the salt to 1 tsp and reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp as well. I had rave reviews and half my family and friends requested the recipe for themselves... (the other half probably haven't tried it yet;o) These are a hearty delicious pancake! For a twist I also added chopped apple to the batter which my finicky 2 year old granddaughter LOVED! Thanks for the recipe!!! Definitely worth a try.",
