I ALSO USED GINGER ALE INSTEAD OF BEER!! :-) Made this as is but w/1.25 lb ground turkey, so I cut cooking time and all ingredients in half, except for chili powder which I'm glad I used less of... I recommend no more than 2 heaping tablespoons chili powder per pound, very easy to make your own to your liking- a great base is 1 tsp paprika, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp oregano, 2 tsp garlic powder per 1 lb meat... Anywho! I did not drain green chiles and glad I didn't :-) Served this topped w/sour cream, colby-jack & chedder cheese, over macaroni & cheese w/a side of cornbread!

I subbed a 15oz can of pumpkin puree instead of tomato sauce which added some great flavor and thickend up the chili just a bit.  I also used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of pork sausage.

                "reviewBody": "Wonderful recipe!  I did make a little change though.  I used Pink Himalayan salt and ended up almost doubling the salt & black pepper: When I start to brown my ground beef, I salt and pepper it like I was cooking a hamburger; the add onion and other ingredients as called for,  but start with about 3/4 of the salt called for then adjust to taste, after an hour of cooking all ingredients together.  I also put a bay leaf per 2 pounds of ground beef.  I didn't use the beer, but used water in it's place and it was great that way.  I also used extra lean ground beef - 93% lean, and I used about a 1/4 cup of Extra Virgin Olive Oil to brown my ground beef, onions and garlic.  When you use Olive Oil and extra lean beef you have very little grease to skim when you save the left-overs in the frig!  I used Louisiana Hot Sauce for my hot sauce, and it gave it a very nice warm after taste while not blistering you.  Of course you can load it up with various hot sauces to turn the heat up, if you like to suffer when you eat chili!  Overall, one of, if not the best chili I have eaten, PERIOD!  \n\n01/01/2020 UPDATE:  Still my favorite Chili Recipe, and it is very Keto and Paleo diet Friendly!  A new tweak to the recipe, since I've started watching my sugar intake since my original review, I use 1 teaspoon of Stevia powder, instead of the brown sugar.  I've also switched to Avocado Oil, but Extra Virgin Olive oil is still good choice too.  I've cooked this in an Insta-Pot, and it is much quicke",
