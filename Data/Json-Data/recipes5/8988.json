I had been using canned sauce for ease but made this recipe tonight (I actually started it yesterday) and wow, I was blown away with the difference it made.\n\nI had been really enjoying my enchiladas before but wasn't expecting just how much better they were going to be with Chef John's sauce.\n\nThe only change I made (the part that I started yesterday) was buying dried ancho chilis and making a paste from them yesterday to use in the sauce today.\n\nWhile making the sauce I thought it was a bit on the heavy side, flavor-wise but, after putting it with the enchiladas, it was the perfect level of spice\n\nIt is totally worth the effort to make the sauce yourself and I will not be buying canned again except in the most dire of enchilada emergencies.",
