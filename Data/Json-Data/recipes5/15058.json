The second time, however, it was OUT OF THIS WORLD making the following changes:  Instead of broiling, melt the butter in a saucepan over med/high heat.  Add the remaining ingredients (except the lemon) and sautee the scallops for approx two minutes on each side.  Pour the scallops and the sauce over pilafed rice, squeeze fresh lemon juice over the top, and garnish with a little parsley and a tiny bit of paprika for color.

I also took the suggestion of brushing on the mixture before pouring it into the dish, and I sprinkled some chili powder on top before broiling. I was going for paprika, but the chili actually gave it some added spice, which turned out very well! ",

Tried it again and slightly warmed a minced clove of garlic (or more depending on how many scallops) to the butter before sprinkling the top of the scallops with it. Topped it with the lemon juice and it was 100% better. This is also great sauteed with the above ingredients. I've also sauteed the scallops in just butter and lemon adding white wine close to the end of cooking time. Yum!!",
