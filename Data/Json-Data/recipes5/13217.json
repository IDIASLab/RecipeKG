My 12 yo is a pancake snob, she mentioned they were a bit too thick, so I may thin them out with a bit of almond milk next time. I used avocado oil, instead of olive oil, it's what I had on hand. I topped mine with bananas, walnuts and maple syrup...I had a good time. Will certainly make them again...trying desperately to get my family off of w flour. Thanks Chef",

Since my Lakanto Monkfruit syrup is like using liquid gold, I replaced the maple syrup with 1/2 teaspoon of organic maple extract,and 1 1/2 Tablespoon of Swerve brown sugar substitute. I used the maple Monkfruit syrup on the almond pancakes after they were finished.  Delicious Chief John! I am happy that you're interested in healthier foods.;)",
