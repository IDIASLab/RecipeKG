I really liked that this used fresh green beans and no cream of soup. On that note, I did feel it lacked some flavor that you would typically get out of the cream of soup. I questioned the microwave steps in this recipe but it worked perfectly. Overall good recipe and one I would make again with a couple small tweaks.",
