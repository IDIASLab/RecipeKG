Personally i would cook down the onion, add the garlic, stir in a little \"white\" wine, simmer for 5 min, add 6 chopped Roma tomatoes, 2 tbsp. of chopped capers, simmer another 5 min, add roughly chopped fresh spinach (about a cup) and cook for another 3-4 min. Then add some finishing salt to taste. Simple, easy and yummy.",

I usually eyeball my measurements but stuck to the main ingredients for the sauce. I didn't have diced tomatoes but I did have a can of crushed stewed tomatoes that also had italian seasonings in it. Will definitely make it again and again! Thanks for sharing!",
