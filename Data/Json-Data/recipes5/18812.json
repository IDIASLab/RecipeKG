After reading Tristan's mom's review I used a very loosely packed 1/4 cup of brown sugar but otherwise followed the directions. Instead of chopping the veggies (I thought it would never hold up in a stew) I cut them into chunks. My four year old had two helpings of the stew (and this is a kid who would never eat a parsnip or a turnip if he had a choice) as did my husband and myself. My 2 year old said it was too spicy for him. We didn't find this to be too sweet at all...a nice flavor with a teeny kick to it. We will probably make it again at some point but I might increase the sweet potatoes and decrease the parsnip/turnip pairing.",
