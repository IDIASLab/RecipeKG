I couldn't find fresh mandarin oranges so I used a juice orange and canned mandarin oranges. Definitely sprinkle on the cashews and green onions over the top if you like them, it gives it great flavor and presentation on the plate! I will definitely make this again!\nUpdate: I have made this several times since I first discovered the recipe (ditched the fiance, kept the recipe :-)) and I just LOVE it! I have started adding a small, finely diced serrano pepper in place of the red chili flakes. I like the fresh, pepper flavor! I serve it over Basmati rice. YUM!",
