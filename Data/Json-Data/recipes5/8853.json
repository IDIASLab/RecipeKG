                "reviewBody": "8.9.19  First, a recommendation.  Try to get your chicken tenders as evenly thick as possible, flattening out a bit if necessary, so they all cook at the same time.  There were a number of things that just didn\u2019t work for me with this recipe.  The recipe tells you to add the cilantro mixture to the browned chicken tenders, and \u201c\u2026cook until juices evaporate and sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.\u201d  Well, there is no juice to cook down, and once the cilantro mixture hits the medium-high skillet, it sticks immediately, starts to burn, since the chicken tenders soaked up the small amount of oil added at the beginning, and there\u2019s just no moisture in the cilantro mixture.  I added some water to the skillet, and then I had to add more water, since it evaporated almost immediately.  Nothing ever \u201cthickened.\u201d  I added the bell peppers and had to add even a bit more water.  The recipe as written would totally dry out your chicken, and you do want a little bit of sauce, juice (call it what you want) to drizzle over the chicken.  The rice cooked up fine, although I was surprised how subtle the cumin and cinnamon flavor was, but I\u2019m not complaining about that.  Overall, this tasted just OK, and that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m giving it 2 stars.  Sorry, I know I\u2019m the first reviewer and it  has been quite a while since I\u2019ve written a review like this, but this recipe is inaccurate, and I won\u2019t be making again.",
