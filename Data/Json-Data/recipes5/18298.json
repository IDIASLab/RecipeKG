For the meat mixture, I used 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/8 cup brown sugar, 1-1/2 cups crackers, added garlic powder and worcestershire.\nMade only 1/2 the amount of glaze. Baked the loaf for 15 min. longer than recommended.\nThis was absolutely delicious, both hot and cold. I would make it again in a heartbeat, but only with my modifications. Thanks, Duano.",

This may have been a result of using butter crackers or maybe because I use beef/pork/veal for my meatloaves instead of ground beef. I also use only 1 egg instead of 2. The negative side is this recipe is way too sweet!!! All that sugar! I will use the cracker idea again, but that's it. I'll go back to my brown gravy instead. This tasted too much like a sweet sloppy joe.",

As someone who douses his breakfast bacon and sausage with maple syrup, he said he didn't mind. Of course, it turned out that it was indeed a touch too sweet for him (I personally couldn't eat more than half a mouthful). I'm gonna scrape the sauce topping off, and make it into sandwiches tomorrow. Other than the sweetness issue, this is a good recipe - the loaf held together nicely, and had a good general flavor. ",

I scale down the brown sugar and I work with the amount of meat I have. If you don't like sweet and savory combos -- don't try this. My kids know this as mom's meatloaf. They probably always will because I'll always make this one. It's just the best around. If you love Amish cooking and hearty, stick-to-your ribs food, you'll love this. If you want something healthier then get a back-up recipe with turkey or something and keep this one for special occasions. If you use less than 2 pounds of ground meat but all the sugar --- it's going to be too sweet. Don't skip the bacon -- it truly adds something & I now top my stuffed peppers with this glaze & strips of bacon. YUM. O.",

I sauteed the onions in butter and cut the glaze in half. These were both good moves. This recipe does make a sweet meatloaf, so if that isn't your thing, consider yourself warned. This makes a very moist meatloaf and I think I would cut the cracker crumbs down to 2 cups. I added black pepper and garlic powder to the mixture. I would be tempted to add chopped green pepper. The glaze is good and I would consider making the full amount and use it for mashed potatoes. I served this with mashed potatoes and it was very good. This did take an extra 10 minutes to get thoroughly done. This is one of my more favorite meatloaf recipes from this site. Thank you.",

I used townhouse crackers ( one sleeve and 6 additional crackers) I halved the brown sugar in the meat mixture and used precooked bacon but left everything else the same. Everyone raved over it! It was so moist and flavorful I was shocked. I cooked mine for almost 2 hours ( free formed into a loaf in a roasting pan) and drained the grease before addding the glaze. I cannot wait to have a sandwich later with this! Thanks!!",

I ommitted the bacon(just didnt have any went light on the brown sugar and put two slices of bread on the bottom of the loaf pan to suck up some of the grease - worked well. I think it helped with keeping the meatloaf together. Will make again maybe when his mother visits:)",
