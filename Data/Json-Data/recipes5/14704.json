I would probably use only 1/2 teaspoon salt next time.",

We wanted something that wasn't pan fried with cheese on top, like we always prepare it. This was fast, easy, healthy, and delicious. He didn't change a thing in the recipe.  The flavor complemented the grilled pork we were eating. Since we always have the ingredients on hand, even the fresh rosemary, I saved it to my Recipe Box. We did use a good quality balsamic vinegar to ensure a great flavor.",
