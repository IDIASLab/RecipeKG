I love pure maple syrup myself, if I could afford it, it would also work here, but it is sweeter, so use your own judgement when adding the amount. You really can't screw this recipe up! If it's too sweet add a little more mayo. For this recipe, I never measure, just add the 2 together until I get it the way I like it. Hope you enjoy!",

I serve this with homemade sweet potato fries, fresh sweet potatoes sliced into sticks tossed with a little olive oil, cinnamon and salt, baked til crispy. This dip compliments them beautifully!

Then I added cinnamon and a tbsp of honey. Mine came out much darker than the one pictured. But it's really good. I'm going to start putting this on baked sweet potatoes.\n\nEdit: Mom had the idea to pour the leftover dip over vanilla ice cream. Then I had the idea to add a little spiced rum. Delicious!  This recipe is very versatile and so easy. Thanks!",
