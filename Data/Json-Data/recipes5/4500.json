This initially came out as a big soupy mess. 1/3 cup of bulgur wasn't nearly enough so I ended up going back and hydrating another cup of dried bulgur and then adding it to the rest of the ingredients. Before I added more bulgur I had a bowl of parsley mint and tomatoes floating in lemon & tomato juice. Since this was already so soupy I only used half of the olive oil and I also cut back on the salt. You might consider seeding the tomatoes to cut back on the liquids. This was also much more lemony than any other recipe I've tried. I didn't mind the lemon flavor but it was much more prominent than any versions I've been served before.",

I substituted half of a large cucumber for two of the tomatoes substituted green onions for a milder onion flavor only used the juice of one lemon and only 1 Tablespoon of olive oil; I also used ground allspice instead of cinnamon and I added one clove of garlic and in the future may use two or three. This recipe is much too watery as written even if the bulgur is drained after cooking which it should be. With my modifications I would give this a rating of four; it's still not the best tabouli I've ever had but it's good and I'll make it again.",
