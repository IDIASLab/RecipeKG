Slow cooked in a slow cooker so even the toughest of roasts or stew meats will work; eventually the meat just falls apart! Also good served over hot cooked rice. Delicious!",

This is deff. one of his favorites and it is so easy.I also love this recipe because I make a big bake with the leftovers the next day so its 2 dinners in 1. Just take a 9x13 pan. Spread 2 cans of crecent rolls across the bottom then put the meat and cover with cheddar cheese. Last step is to cover top with 1 more can of crecent rolls ( I make it a lattice top) bake at 375 for 20-30 min. or till browned and warmed through. So Good!",
