Here's what I did different: 1) I only had chicken breast on hand so I boiled two large ones whole with veggies like step one says to but I added chicken bouillon because I didn't have the carcass to provide flavor. 2) Instead of cooling the broth and blending it with a portion of veggies I put all the veggies in at the beginning. Then after 45 min. I scooped out about 1/2 the veggies and just blended them with a hand mixer and then added it back into the soup along with the chicken after I chopped them into small pieces. 3) In step four it calls for 3 cans of broth to pour the eggs into but I only used about 1 1/2 cans and I had more than enough liquid in my soup. One more thing... b/c I used bouillon for flavor in step one it was a little salty so I would omit the salt if I made it this way again.",

I am watching fat intake so I removed the skin and proceeded as the recipe instructs. It made a wonderful stock a beautiful glisten even w/o the skin on. At any rate I followed the directions as written and came out with a beautiful hearty soup. When my husband came back later for a second bowl it was then that he realized he didn't get any chicken in the first bowl. He was surprised that he didn't miss it. He added \"That's how good this soup is I didn't miss the chicken.\" I served it with biscuits from a recipe I got from this site called \"Cheese Garlic Biscuits II\". In this recipe though I use 1 full tsp. of baking powder instead of 1/2 and I add 3 minced cloves of garlic to the mix and omitted the brushing of butter once cooked. There is more than enough fat in this recipe you'll see it on the cookie sheet. They were warm & crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside. Right out of the oven to the table. A great pairing with the Stracciatella. Mangia!:)",
