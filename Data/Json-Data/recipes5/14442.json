                "reviewBody": "Super tasty! It is pretty time consuming but I chose to make the green sauce the day before and that helped a lot with prep. I had some leftover smoked pork butt and OMG what an amazing way to use it up! It just added another delicious layer of flavor. I have to admit I was skeptical of the coconut milk however you don't even taste coconut and it helps thicken the chili. This definitely needs more than a pinch of salt - adjust to taste but you're going to need at least 2 teaspoons. I was tempted to add some to the green sauce however I waited til the end to adjust the salt. I didn't bother with adding the chicken broth in 2 different steps - I just added 2 cups at once and simmered til it was thickened to my liking about 45 minutes. I served this as taco filling one night and will be eating leftovers over rice. Finally this makes a lot but you'll be glad it did! Thanks for the great recipe!",
