I didn't take the squash out of the shells pulled the flesh from the skin and mixed it with the melted butter and brown sugar in the hollow and just ate it from the shell. Next time I think I will do as you suggested and remove the flesh with the butter and brown sugar mix it up and serve it that way I think it would be better even thought we really enjoyed it the way I did it. I may try using a little less brown sugar and butter next time I think I'd like more of the squash flavor although my husband may not agree with that! We at this with roast turkey mashed potatoes and gravy. Thanks for sharing this recipe.",
