I have played around with it in different recipes, but it makes such a good dip for either soft pita or chips.  It is savory and warm tasting and I heartily recommend everyone try it! Be sure to use pureed pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling.",

That changed with this recipe! \n\nI gave this 5 stars with the admission that I didn't care much for the pumpkin pie spices and will not use them next time I make this.  I divided the ingredients into 2 batches because it wouldn't all fit in my blender, but forgot the spices with the first. It tasted divine! Next go-round I remembered the spice, but was disappointed in the result. I didn't bother adding spice to the other half, so the flavor was diluted by the time I combined the mixtures. To further cover it up, I added a couple dashes of cayenne and paprika. OMG this was spectacular!\n \nThe pumpkin flavor is VERY subtle, but adds a creamy texture and richness that definitely makes it a worthwhile addition. (Healthy, too!). Definitely remember to add salt to taste at the end to help bring out the flavors. You can't believe how much this small addition helps things along!\n\n After reading other reviews, I held off on the full 5oz of lemon juice and added it gradually to taste instead. With the omission of the spices, this is now my go-to for hummus.  I made this as a dip with pita triangles for a farewell potluck at work, and my biggest challenge will be to stay out of it long enough for my coworkers to get any!",
