Cut up the chicken and serve it cold with lettuce and almonds for a tremendous \"grilled\" chicken salad.  As an extra bonus, leftover sauce can be used as a dressing!  If yours is as thick as mine was, you  might want to add some water to thin it out a bit, though.",

                "reviewBody": "I was really skeptical about this recipe. I was afraid of the Dijon, thinking it would over power, but it was perfect and blended nicely with the  brown sugar and o.j. ( I am no fan of dijon but this worked great) I was also afraid it would be too orangy or too sweet and that the chicken would be bland. So I used chicken cutlet that I added salt & pepper to and then dredged in flour, shaking off any excess. This made my sauce really nice as it cooked and kept the thin chicken moist and it looked great. This allowed me to cut down on the cooking time by 20 minutes!The thin chicken needed less o.j. to cover.  Before putting my chicken in the baking dish, I lightly browned the onions in a tablespoon or two of butter. ( I used sweet onion)  I used a basting brush to thinly paint a bit of dijon on the bottom of the dish and then added half of the onions then I added the chicken. I also used a sprinkle of crushed red pepper after covering the chicken with the o.j. When it came time to make my sauce I did not use more o.j, but instead used a 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I also reserved a tablespoon of the brown sugar that goes on the chicken at the end. I used that to sweeten my sauce to my taste and only used barely 1/2 of that TBS. I added another sprinkle of the crushed red pepper here, but that may or may not be too strong for some although everyone in my house liked it alot- even the fussy ones.Well almost everyone...my ole man said it was a bit on the sweet side and would be good",
