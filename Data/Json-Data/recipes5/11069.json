Both my husband and I really enjoyed it.\n\nHere are the changes I made:  I added 1 tablespoon of onion powder and some minced garlic.  I shredded one cup of sharp cheddar cheese and used this as a topping.  Broiling the pie for the last five minutes ensured that I had good browning of the cheese.  I think the sharp cheddar cheese and the onion powder made all the difference!  ",
