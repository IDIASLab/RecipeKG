My tried-and-true \"recipe\" for chicken livers had always involved saut\u00e9ing onion slices in oil/butter flouring the livers (liberally) and adding them to the onions perhaps with a little milk... to make \"gravy.\" Jchasko's recipe was a revelation. With some trepidation I tossed the naked livers into my heated (stainless-steel non-treated) skillet. I fully expected them to stick tenaciously to the pan and be reduced to a bitter scorched mess. Wow. They skittered around the pan allowing me to move them about for uniform browning (no need for spatter shield). I did depart from Jchasko's directions a bit: I had no lemon; I added a coarsely chopped onion and a healthy shot of ground black pepper; and (because I was feeling lazy) substituted several dashes of garlic powder for the called-for six cloves of fresh garlic. Very tasty... and incredibly easy! Next time I may even follow the recipe!",

Unfortunately, we weren't fans of the lemon/liver combo. My lemon was very freshly picked, & the flavor of the dish reminded me of lemon bars with liver added.  I'll make this again, using the same technique, but will skip the lemon. I'd give it 5 stars without the lemon, and will be sure to add a little more garlic next time.",
