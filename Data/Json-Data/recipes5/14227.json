For the final step, I used a 32oz container of chicken broth and added 6 more cups of water because I used a 6lb can of hominy. The flavor is amazing! Don't forget to garnish with shredded cabbage, chopped onion, chopped radishes, and lime or lemon juice. I will definitely make this again.",

I had this at a friend's house last weekend and was looking for a copycat recipe and this is fairly close.  Don't be fooled by all the peppers used in this recipe.  It's not spicy at all.  \n\n\nEdit:  Okay, so I had my friends over after the first time making this, so I'm changing my rating.  Based on the way I was told they make it, I made the following changes.  Use 3 guajillo and 3 ancho chiles.  Leave out the pasilla as it makes it taste more like an American chili.  Second, is toast the peppers first.  Use a tablespoon of olive oil and saute them with the onions on medium high heat until the onions are going translucent, then add the cumin seeds and garlic, then continue following the recipe.  Toasting the peppers doesn't seem like a big deal, but it makes all the difference in the world as far as bringing out the flavors.  I doubled the recipe and used 6 guajillo and 6 ancho peppers along with a 6 lb can of hominy.  Use low sodium chicken broth, garnish with cabbage, onions, cilantro, sliced radishes and hot sauce and you've got a tasty, healthy meal.",

I did not know if the peppers were fresh or dried but I was only able to find one of the chilis fresh and so I used dried for the two other chilis.

I use a pressure cooker.  I make the pur\u00e9e as the recipe calls for and place it on the side.  I cut the pork shoulder into 1 and a half inch cups and salt it liberally.  I then put the pork cuts into the pressure cooker and poor the pur\u00e9e over it and also add the chicken stock.  I boil it under pressure for an hour.  I add the hominy and mix and let sit for 5 minutes, it's ready to label into a bowl and serve with diced onion and cilantro to top it off.  The meet is so tender, I can cut it with a spoon and the broth is perfect.  One of my favorite things to make.",

Rating this a 4 because the tweak I made that sells it for me is a flavor addition. So changes: Omit onion; upped garlic to about 2-3 Tbsp rough chopped pieces (because I love garlic and to make up for the onion omit) Toasted (dried) peppers (per another review's suggestion) prior to toasting cumin seeds then proceeded as normal; using ancho guajillo and New Mexico dried peppers because that's what our store carries Winning tweak: added a large pinch or two of dried Mexican oregano (per review suggestion and dried because slow cooker) maybe up to 2 tsp (I love oregano) The sauce is already incredible; this time around I'm using pork beef and chicken because that's what I happened to have enough of on hand.
