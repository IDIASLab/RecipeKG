I patted my fruit dry after I'd chopped it before adding the lemon juice. I don't have a 9 X13 pan so I had to cram all my ingredients into a 8 X 11 maybe it's all the extra pressing I did that ensured my crust held together perfectly. I'm really a fan because there is no flour or egg in this recipe and the butter & sugar are used judiciously. It's a healthier dessert that pairs nicely with a good cup of coffee. I have a cherry blueberry version in the oven right now & I'm quiet optimistic.",

This crumble was tart and not too sweet. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar I only used 1/8 tsp each of the nutmeg and cloves but used 2 tsp Penzey's Vietnamese Cinnamon which has a better flavor than store bought. We topped it off with Cool Whip. This was very good and will be my go-to recipe for a quick dessert.",
