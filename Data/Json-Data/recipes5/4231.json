First of all not everyone can deal with spicy..no worries about eliminating the Cayenne Pepper lemon pepper is so much better! I also absolutely love the texture of the lentils in this soup so blending them and ommitting the reason this soup is so good feels wrong I instead sauteed the onions with carrots and garlice and pureed them and added them to the soup. I also browned some chicken breast bits and threw them in as well. Doubled the cumin and omitted the cilantro. Great recipe!!!",
