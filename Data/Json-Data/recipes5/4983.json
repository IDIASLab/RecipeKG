It is easy to put together, but the longer the stovetop step simmers, the better the casserole will be when served. Leftovers are yummy! You could serve this over rice, if you like, with a green salad. I just serve it in pasta bowls with crusty bread, butter, and a nice glass of red wine. Enjoy!",

                "reviewBody": "Mama Mia this is good! I would give this 10 stars if I could! I am so glad I tried it as I never really liked eggplant before this. But I will definitely make this again and again!One of the things that might have put this over the top was the sauce I used. I was lucky enough to be gifted a Tomato, Olive and Ouzo sauce imported from Greece, if you can find that or make that sauce I highly recommend it! With the Greek sauce in mind, I used Greek seasoning instead of the lamb seasoning but kept the cumin, paprika and mint the same. I also added a dash of allspice, a little chili flake and half a chopped red pepper to the onion mixture. I also used a 14 ounce can of copped tomatoes instead of fresh as that's all I had on hand. Like the recipe submitter says, the longer the stove-top the better the outcome!! I also baked it uncovered like recommended! I wasn't sure if I'd prefer just bread or served over rice so I tried both. Rice definitely makes it a meal, and it soaks up the sauce. But the bread is good too, and served with a salad would make a lighter meal. My husband and I sprinkled some parmesan on ours, and I thought \"how good would this be if I drizzled a b\u00e9chamel sauce over top?\" So I made a basic b\u00e9chamel with parmesan cheese and a dash of nutmeg, poured that over the casserole and baked for 15 minutes. Oh-so-awesome!! I could see this used as a sauce over orzo, pasta or egg noodles. Put this on your must-try list!~~update--This tastes even better the next day!",

I'm not a fan of eggplant or lamb but decided to try the eggplant i did however substitute ground beef for the lamb. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I omitted the rosemary and i didnt have dried mint..but added fresh mint on top before serving. Also decided to cook mine in the Slow cooker (too hot for oven today)..knowing it was going into the slow cooker i reduced the liquids just a touch. I used a 12oz jar of a delicious Tomato Olive and Ouzo sauce..which was gifted to me (DELISH)and used only 2/3 cup of the chicken broth. Overall this was great...and i didn't have a problem with the eggplant..all the flavors complimented each other real nicely...I Also really loved what the Lemon did to this dish..made it seem real fresh! Cooked in slow cooker on low for 4 hours.",
