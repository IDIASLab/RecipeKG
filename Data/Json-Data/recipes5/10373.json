So I used the zest of one full lemon to make sure it was lemon-y! It was perfect. I also used 4 small to med zuchhini. Had to use dried oregano since thats what I had.

I used whipped cream cheese and that worked out well. Oh also I used less oregano than called for b/c I only had dried and we don't like a strong oregano flavor. I would make this again but add more zest or lemon juice or something just for a little tang. Thanks for sharing.:)",
