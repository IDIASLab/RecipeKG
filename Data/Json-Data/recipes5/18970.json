Not a problem because the amount that's left is going to make a yummy fruit dip snack for me later... For calorie counters how about just serving the grapes with a dollop of the dressing on top? Next time I make this I hope to have fresh mint from the garden as I think it would be a great addition and garnish. Thanks for the quick and easy and GOOD tasting recipe.",
