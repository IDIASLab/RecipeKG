In mine I put closer to 1/2 cup of each. Also, in addition to everything in this recipe try adding 3/4 TBSP of red wine vinegar. It is AMAZING. I just made a batch and I think I would ruin it by putting in on a sandwich with cheese. For now I'm just eating it with crackers so I can taste all of the fresh flavors.",

I cut the mayo down to 1/4 cup & it was still too much for my preference, but I really did like the recipe.  Thanks Emily! ;)",

Also added 1 tsp. of sweet relish squeezed 1/2 small-sized lemon juice onto the tuna and finally added some dried cranberries as well as raisins onto 1/2 cup of mixture consisting of miracle whipp & regular mayo. I served this salad with wholemeal bread as breakfast and lunch the next day & found that it taste soooo yummy as I am eating now... minus the usual fishy smell; while hubby just texted to review that though this salad tastes good but it doesn't taste like tuna anymore! So a 4-star for this recipe to justify our mixed reviews but I personally would make this again and again and again... as I love the refreshing and unique taste. LATEST: Finished off the salad leftover this afternoon over 4 pieces of low-salt crackers and topped with some ceyanne pepper and the tuna salad really tasted so much better with crackers on the 2nd day believe me... Yummy yummy and yummy:)",
