The glaze has a wonderful flavor and I made a little extra to pour over the quinoa. Like lutzflcat I also used the zest from the lemon...a Meyer lemon in this case. I used vanilla almond milk and raw honey instead of maple syrup...just what I had on hand. A sprinkle of chopped almonds and I had a protein-packed and very good breakfast! This is definitely a keeper for me and it has many options for different flavor combinations that I look forward o trying. Mine never really solidified to the point of slicing but I found I prefer this heated with a little extra almond milk poured over it anyway so it didn't matter.",

He thought it was just O.K. ate it but said he wouldn't ask me to make again. The thing that was surprisingly good to me was the glaze to which I added the zest of the lemon which really brightened the flavor. If you're a quinoa lover give this one a try. It certainly was \"outside the box\" for us but it was a nice change for breakfast today.",

I didn't have a full pint of blueberries on hand so I added craisins. Then I added some shredded coconut to take it up to yet another level. I did have to cook the quinoa about twice as long as the recipe called for but if you've ever cooked quinoa before you know that you cook it until all the water is absorbed. Mine set up enough to slice. For the glaze due to not having fresh lemons I substituted lemon juice. All in all I thought this was a great recipe and will definitely make it again.",

I cut this recipe by 2/3 (there are only two of us in the house and due to dietary issues neither of us eats much) so 1c quinoa and I used only 1.5 c of apple juice for the quinoa (based on some of the reviews... we wanted something not soupy/gloppy). I also felt it needed more sweetness. I used honey instead of maple syrup (I don't like the fake stuff and that's all we had in the house) and ran out (I had enough for the recipe but not extra) so I added stevia to up the sweetness in both. I added cinnamon to the quinoa and instead of adding blueberries at the end I added them 10 minutes into cooking the quinoa and let them cook together for the last five minutes of cooking. I had extra fresh squeezed lemon juice and just made the full amount of topping (several reviews said they made extra so I just didn't cut that part of the recipe down). That topping is TART!! I used honey AND stevia in it and I think it was still almost too bold. My boyfriend said it was better in the middle where it had soaked into the quinoa overnight so I might not let it thicken as much next time so it'll soak in more fully. I think this recipe has a LOT of potential though. We always have fruit in the house and since it's autumn I think I'm going to try an apple/cranberry/walnut version with a cinnamon caramel topping next time. And maybe raspberries or blackberries with the lemon or mangoes with lime instead of lemon.",
