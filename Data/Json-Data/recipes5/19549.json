My family LOVES these! I have also taken them to several BBQ's and they are ALWAYS a big hit! For dinner, I like to serve them with a side of steamed minute rice to go along with the meatballs.

I did also reduce the milk called for and trust me they were still PLENTY soft. My husband thought the house smelled great when he walked in the door and was more impressed when they hit his mouth. It was too simple but I still relished in the praise!;O) Thanks for the recipe!",

Used pineapple tidbits not chunks and cut the pepper finely.",

I had some time on my hands while my daughter napped so I made the meatballs and put them in the slow cooker on low w/ only the liquid ingredients (pineapple juice cider vinegar soy sauce) and the cornstarch for 3 hours. I chopped the green pepper and about 1/4 C red onion and put them in the fridge w/ the pineapple chunks. After the 3 hrs I turned the cooker up to high for 1 hr. It helped reduce the sauce so it was thicker and gooier. I turned it back to low and added the green pepper onion and pineapple for 1 last hour. They were delicious! The sauce was a good consistency the veggies were still slightly crisp the pineapple was a little tender and the meatballs had time to absorb the flavors:)",
