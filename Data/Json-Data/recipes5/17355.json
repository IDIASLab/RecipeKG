I melted the caramels on the stovetop in a non-stick saucepan with a tablespoon or two of water added and they came out smooth. Rather than try to \"spread\" the caramel, I just drizzled it over the top of the apples with a spoon and it worked out fine. The prep time for this is quite a bit longer than 15 minutes though....I'd say at least 30 minutes; baking time is accurate. Be sure to use real butter in the crust...it DOES make a big difference in the taste.  We liked these better chilled than fresh out of the oven.  Quite addicting though...my husband keeps asking for them. Thanks!!",
