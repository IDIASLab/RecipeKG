I used leftover pork (spanish pork w/ white wine from this site) but my leftovers were very juicy & tender. I can't recommend leftover pork that is dry or tough.  I did not have fresh ginger nor chile paste so I subbed ground ginger & red pepper flakes (foodsubs.com is a great resource for knowing what to sub) but not in the same quantities...I just taste tested it & quit when it tasted right. I, of course, did not use the marinade since my pork was precooked. In addition to the peppers, I added mushrooms & frozen, thawed snow peas. Because of the addition of the veggies I had to increase the teriyaki sauce. I sauteed the veggies in sesame oil for a few minutes, added the leftover pork cubes & then added the teriyaki, ginger & red pepper flakes...allowing it to simmer for a little while until liquid was absorbed. I served it over jasmine rice & instead of garnishing it w/ toasted almonds, I sliced up a bit of green onions. Mandarin Almond Salad (from thsi site) was the perfect complement",

Then I mixed the 3 T. fresh ginger that it called for.  I used it all(not just 5 T.) Then I mixed up some cornstarch with water and added a little at a time(1 T. cornstarch, 1 T. water)  I also marinaded the prokloin over night and baked it for an hour.  It was so tender I could have cut it with a fork!!!! Cooled it and stirfried it with the peppers and sauce.",

We drained off the Olive Oil in the marinade before stir frying but it still seemed like too much with the residule marinade plus the stir fry oil. The recipe says to \"continue to stir fry until most of the liquid has evaporated\"...but there is way too much oil plus other additives to do that without overcooking the meat and peppers. Has anybody tried not adding the V Oil for stir frying and just stir frying with the Marinade? Better for you...",
