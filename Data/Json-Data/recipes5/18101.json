Where did you get the recipe?\" I loved it too. It tasted much like my mother's recipe. The only things I would add to this recipe are: 1) Bake it in a 5 X 9 bread loaf pan 2) Add some cloves on the top during cooking and remove them afterwards (adds flavor) and 3) for more flavor add a generous amount of your favorite ketchup on top and spread it evenly before baking. All in all I give this a 5-star rating because it WAS the best! Edit: I just made it again and this time added 1 small chopped onion and 1 chopped green bell pepper and 1 chopped red bell pepper. Fry the bell pepper with a little cooking oil (just enough to coat the bottom of the pan) add to the mixture and then brown the onions too and add to the mixture before making the loaf.",
