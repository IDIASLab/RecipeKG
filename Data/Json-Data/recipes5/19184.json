Mix the sugar, flour and salt very well before adding to the wet ingredients (I used a pastry blender).  Remember to add the sugar mixture slowly to the wet, mixing well so that the sugar dissolves. I love the fact that the recipe does not require butter as so many others do.  To get this pie right, you'll need to remove it from the oven as soon as the custard is set.  I used the oven directions as directed (10 minutes at 400, 40 minutes at 350) and it was perfect.  My mother was Acadian, and her recipe could not match this one. My husband and I love it. Update...for those who have texture issues this pie should be mixed slowly and thoroughly. The sugar needs to be completely dissolved. The texture should be similar to pecan pie...smooth and custard-like.",
