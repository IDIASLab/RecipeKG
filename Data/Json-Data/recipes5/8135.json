Often times I use the leftover marinade when the first batch is gone and add it to the next batch. It's tangy taste is much loved, even by my non veggie-loving kids!",

I may try all balsamic another time as I like it's smoothness and it seems less pungent. I did add a few tsps of sugar to cut the acidity. I was happy to have fresh basil and parsley on hand so I used that and skipped the thyme. Extra garlic of course. A great recipe especially in the summer when the quality of the tomatoes is so much better.",

Not only was this tasty, but it made a great presentation for recent guest.  Next time I might add a tad bit of sugar as one reviewer suggested.  My red wine vinegar, I thought, was a bit strong.  Thanks so much for this recipe!",
