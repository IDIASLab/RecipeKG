After cooking the bacon, I browned the chicken breasts in the bacon drippings. Then I added about a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan to saute the garlic and added the brussel sprouts, potatoes, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Then I added a little chicken broth  and returned the chicken to the pan. I covered it and put it in the oven to cook at 350 for about 40 minutes and it was perfect. Maybe next time I'll actually pan roast it with the lemon slices. I'm sure it is excellent. Thank you LAMBR for sharing this recipe.",

I also had to make a 2nd batch of the lemon garlic sauce to get everything coated well.\nIt smelled absolutely wonderful cooking though!  I will try it again because it's a great combination of ingredients, but I will not put the lemon on the bottom as called for.
