Got the perfect muffin shape with high tops and shoulders... Very tender and fluffy inside... the white sugar gave it a soft white colour and I think it looks more delicate in addition to tasting so... The crust was golden and not too thick... The little jam \"surprise\" was good as the muffin was not too sweet... Some leaked throup the top... the colour contrast against the soft white inside was also very pretty... Overall a great way to impart subtle flavour to muffins... as well as an easy way to make never-tough muffins... Will definitely make again... Highly recommended!!",

Brown throughout (which I expected w/ the brown sugar) and not very pretty as cakes go. I did mix up some milk vanilla and powdered sugar to drizzle over the top. Next time I may try to find a stronger flavored yogurt to use. Very enjoyable. I may make again to use for my daughter's first birthday cake as she really enjoyed this first one I made!",
