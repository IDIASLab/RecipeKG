I didn't want the onions to have any bite in them for this. Maybe that's why the honey mustard was too sweet, but I still would prefer well-caramelized onions to bitey ones in this. Loved the addition of a half tsp Worcestershire in the brushing butter. Was a great, easy mid-afternoon lunch on a lazy, football-watching day.",
