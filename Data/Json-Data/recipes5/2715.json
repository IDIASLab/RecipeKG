I also used sliced balck olives instead of kalamata marinated artichoke hearts (which I think have wonderful flavor in the marinade) instead of canned and I also used fresh basil in the dressing instead of dried....Wonderful flavors and the dressing was great on this salad. My company loved it. I really liked the roasted red peppers and artichoke hearts with the potatoes.....really tasty. A nice change of pace from the traditional mayo salads. A keeper. Thanks!",

I made it EXACTLY to specifications and found that it first of all looked unappetizing -- a sickly mushy brown color all over (thanks to the balsamic). Second of all it was much too tangy (again the vinegar). Finally the garlic really came on strong in the dish. Otherwise it is a clever mixture of tastes and colors and I thought it was an inspired idea. I tried the mixture without the dressing before I added it and found it to be quite tasty with several colorful elements. My recommendation is to either: 1) remove the dressing altogether especially if serving to guests that don't like powerful dishes; or 2) cut the vinegar and garlic by half and/or substitute a quality white wine vinegar. This way the natural tastes and colors of the dish aren't overwhelmed by the balsamic vinegar.",

So... I decided to try it as just a roasted potato salad with the rest of the ingredients. Normally I would NEVER review a recipe I had changed so drastically cause I don't think that's fair. But the things I disliked had nothing to do with what I changed so I'm rating it anyway. I'm a cheese lover but discovered I don't care for Gorgonzola! It was suggested I try Havarti and I also found a \"Mediterranean\" gouda (had tiny bits of olive dried tomato and herbs in it). I used both and I will say they both worked well with these flavors. I figured I used about 3/4 the \"bulk\" of the salad so scaled the dressing to 3/4. I liked the dressing. Now I liked the potatoes when they came out of the oven and really I could see making just that part for a side dish. What I really disliked was the roasted potatoes in a salad like this - i.e. potatoes alone good dressing good but roasted potatoes IN the salad no. Just didn't seem to \"match.\" I would like to try just cooked potatoes like a normal potato salad or possibly adding the roasting ingredients to the dressing sans the extra oil. But definitely an interesting recipe.",

Thank you to everyone who took the time to create, taste, and review my recipe. Nine years, 4.75 stars, and 20 reviews later, I'm honored one of my favorites is enjoyed by so many!\n\nThere were a few reviews, however, that made me reflect and I've put together the following suggestions:\n\nTOO SALTY - Try rinsing the olives before adding, limit your salt on potatoes, and make sure you're buying artichokes and roasted red peppers canned \"in water\" NOT brine.\n\nLOOKS UNAPPEALING - I agree with reviewers. Since I know the orchestra of flavor in each bite, my mind has grown accustom to the look. If you're trying for the first time, I can see how the brown dressing mutes the rainbow of colors which entices one to try the dish. Try using white balsamic vinegar instead (see my two photos in bowl for results). This simple remedy provides the same flavor and keeps the color!\n\nTOO MUCH DRESSING - Simple, lightly dress the potato salad and save remaining balsamic vinaigrette for a lettuce-based salad or caprese.\n\nTOO GARLICKY -  A teaspoon of fresh garlic is a bit ambitious, I admit. Today I typically make my balsamic vinaigrette with 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic + 1/2 teaspoon minced shallot. \n\n*author's notes December, 2018:",

I lightened the color of the dressing by adding 2T. Sour cream and 2 T. Mayo to the dressing. This was done to make the color of the salad more familiar to the wedding guests. The salad as is does have wonderful flavor. Foodies and adventuresome types loved this. I have had several requests for my recipe. I diced my potatoes into 1/2-3/4\" cubes coated them with the oil and put them into a cold oven turned the oven on and 25 minutes later the potatoes were done. I do think the salad tastes better at room temp. so take it out of the frig 20-30 minutes before serving.",
