I envisioned a chicken and noodle type soup as in yellowish broth. The addition of the tomatoes make it a more red broth. No biggie but on that note, the amount of tomatoes was overkill in proportion to the rest. I get the low-carb appeal but I ended up using double the noodles the recipe  called for and even then, it fell short. Recipe has potential but needs some tweaks for sure. As written, it is tomato and chicken with a few noodles soup.",
