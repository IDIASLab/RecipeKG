The big problem is adhering the seasoning and chips to the wings.First coat the wings with garlic flavored olive oil and use a rolling pin to crush the chips into crumbs.For serving, I made a sauce of Caesar dressing/cumin/taco seasoning for dipping the cooked wings.If you intend to make the sauce, dip the uncooked wings in it before applying the taco seasoning and crushed chips.It holds the seasoning and the chips and adds a wonderful flavor to the wings.",
