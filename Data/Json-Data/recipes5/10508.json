I TRIPLED the recipe and there was not one bit of leftovers. However, I used sharp cheddar rather than Gruyere (a Vermonters spin on it) and instead of doing individual sandwiches I hollowed out a big loaf of artisan bread and stuffed it with the cheese sauce. We cut it into sections and had it with a side of steamed broccoli in a sharp cheddar cheese sauce. Absolutely amazing. I will definitely make this dish a regular one. It's affordable, it's quick, and it's delicious.",

My kitchen is almost bare but I had chicken breasts and my husband loves chicken cordon bleu so I decided to try and cobble something together. Hubby gave it a \"very good\" so I thought I'd share! I followed the directions for the most part but I only had Buddig ham sandwich meat and some Irish cheddar or something (the wrapper is gone so I'm not sure. It was just a very sharp cheese!). I doubled the recipe and used panko bread crumbs with the butter as a base in a 7x11 glass pan chopped chicken next and then my crazy ham & cheese mixture. As I said I followed the directions but didn't have Dijon so I mixed some yellow mustard with a bit of dry mustard. I poured/spooned the mix over the chicken and topped it off with another layer of panko and in the oven it went! I like it fairly well myself but I have a low spice tolerance so I'd probably do a little less mustard next time and I admittedly went a little crazy with the panko XD but overall it's a success more than just edible and I definitely want to have it with french bread and \"real\" ham sometime!!!",

I am surprised that Chef didn't add a little cayenne to this since that is present in so many of his recipes!:) I would definitely recommend this sandwich!",

I used 6\" French Rolls from the bakery and doubled the recipe to make 8 open faced sandwiches. My Husband says \"These are great! 5 stars!\" I did use the Gruyere cheese which I have never bought before. Both of my sons were holding their shirts over their noses saying they stink, so I was afraid they wouldn't eat them at all. Well...One son ate 3, the other ate 2. My husband had 2 and then came back in the kitchen and snagged the last one before I got the chance to taste it! I never even got to take a picture of them they were gone so fast! Since Gruyere is so expensive, and according to my 16 y/o smells like stinky feet, I may just use Swiss next time.  I'll have to set one to the side for myself next time before calling in the hoards. According to the guys' reactions, there will definitely be a next time. Keep 'em comin' Chef John, you've saved dinner more than once at our place.",

I don't understand the inclusion of the pickles - they didn't add anything as far as I could tell but were just odd when you bit into them. And the texture was oddly creamy which I found to be off putting. Overall not my favorite but wasn't terrible.",
