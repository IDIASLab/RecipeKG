But the combination of fishsauce lime juice and sugar was quite good and I eagerly looked forward to the finished dish. And then I added the fresh Thai Basil which I have growing in my garden. It nearly ruined the whole dish for me because in that quantity it was just too overbearing! I will do this recipe again but instead of basil I think I'll add some green onions or maybe just a hint of basil. Oh yeah be sure your onions are mild as well - mine weren't. I also used quite a bit of fresh cayenne peppers and was surprised that they weren't hot. Maybe the lime juice obscured their \"bite\".",
