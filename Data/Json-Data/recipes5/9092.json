Feel free to adjust it to your preference, using tofu or chicken (I've done both, but I think the tofu absorbs the sauce better), add the veggies you want, and adjust the red curry paste and Golden Mountain\u00ae sauce to your preference. Best served over white jasmine or basmati rice or vermicelli noodles.",
