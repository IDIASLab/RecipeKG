After reading the other reviews, I made some adjustments and then it was a 5 star dinner for us.  My husband loved it so much that he was already asking when we could have it again before he even finished the meal.  Even my 2 and 4 year olds loved it.  I used only 1/2 cup flour.  I used half of the amount called for of each of the spices.  I juiced two lemons for the \"marinade\" and grated the zest from one of the lemons for the spice mix and one for the juice mixture.  This was the perfect amount for five smallish trout fillets.  They fried up nicely and the flavor was excellent.  The only change I would make next time is to use slightly less salt, it wasn't necessary on top of the nice lemon flavor and other spices.  I did saute the leftover lemon juice with some butter to drizzle over rice, which was a nice touch.  All in all a great meal and we will definitely have it again soon!",

Only need 1/2 tablespoon canola oil & 1/2 tablespoon butter, for frying (or it's too greasy). For 2\u00bd lbs. of trout fillets, reduce flour to 1 cup but keep other spice quantities the same & add 1 pinch of garlic powder to flour mixture. Omit lemon zest & just soak in lemon juice longer (max. 1/2 hour in fridge). Still makes twice as much flour mixture so I put 1/2 in a shallow casserole dish for dredging & store the other 1/2 in a plastic bag, for future use. Served with buttery, parsley baby new potatoes.",

Read the other reviews and decided to cut the flour from 4 cups down to 1 cup. I still had more than half of the flour mixture left over!  I wonder if it's not supposed to be 1/4 cup rather than 4 cups. (???) I did not have the lemon zest on hand, so I omitted it and soaked the trout for a bit longer in the lemon juice.  It tasted perfectly delicious, so don't be afraid to modify the flour mixture based on what you have on hand.  I will definitely be making this again - it got big thumbs up from the family. Thanks for the great recipe.",
