I think next time I will put some veggies in it and try it with noodles or rice. I also wonder how I can make it not separate it was probably the margarine I was using but it sucks when it separates because it doesn't look as appetizing as it really is. Also the recipe makes a ton which is why next time I will half it. of course I didn't use 4 chicken breasts because we usually get full with 2 or 3 cut up in sauce no matter what it is. But I don't think 4 chicken breasts would suffice with the amount it makes. definitely worth trying and tweaking to your tastes although the original is still very good!",

But it definitely doesn t deserve a negative review. It s so hard to believe that grown adults cannot mind their manners and feel the need to write such awful things. Some people need to grow up and learn some respect. I give this recipe 5 stars because there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. I personally will probably add onions to the margarine flour mix at the beginning next time. I put it over rice and steamed broccoli. My mother makes a very similar sauce and adds the onions to it. She uses the sauce to make a broccoli and cauliflower casserole. This is a simple recipe that is delicious. It s like comfort food to me:)",
