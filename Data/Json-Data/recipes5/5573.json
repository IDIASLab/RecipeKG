You can also just eat the fish by itself. When serving the dish, do not unfold the bag, just rip it open on its side and open it up enough to eat from the bag. This keeps all the juices and flavor in one place, and it looks nice.",

The only thing that was a bit hard was trying to keep the wine and lemon juice from leaking out of the sides while I was folding. All in all though it was very easy and made a wonderful healthy light flaky incredibly aromatic fish. The presentation is great too (see my photo...which doesn't do it justice). I didn't have capers so went without but I would recommend using them and not rinsing the brine off. The dish was lacking in salt because I didn't have them (though in retrospect green olives with a little of their juice might have sufficed). This dish is the only thing I've ever seen my Dad put salt on (I did salt the fish beforehand). I paired this with \"Stuffed Peppers Italian Style\" from this site. I will absolutely make this dish again. Thanks so much for posting Paula!",

Then after drying the filets and seasoning them with salt and pepper I spooned over a bit of the tomato mixture on each filet. I topped with a slice of lemon rather than lemon juice to keep it from being too juicy. I omitted the butter and wine. I loosely folded the parchment paper leaving gaps for steam to escape. I did not grease the baking sheet and I baked in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. The fillets were moist and perfect. I served with rice and salad and even the kids gobbled it up with requests for seconds! This will definitely be a repeat in our home.",
