One for the party and one for later. I leave the cheese out until pretty soft then it is easier to mix.

I usually make a cheese log since so there are more nuts-per-cheese and I like to use wheat thins since they are sturdy enough. It's true when it's all mushy the nuts sink in. It's better to refridgerate and then roll it I guess but I'm always doing it last minute so it ends up kinda messy but quite yummy! I never add any salt and I always forget which is one or two tablespoons or teaspoons. But it always has pizazz!
