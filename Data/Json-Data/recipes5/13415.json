I kept the olive oil the same but reduced the seasonings as I didn't have enough green beans for the full recipe. I lined a baking sheet with foil and spread out the green beans and baked them 17 minutes. They were looking a little dry to me to bake them further. They didn't have tons of flavor, on their own, so I added about a tsp of butter and low sodium soy sauce to give them a boost. I served them more as a side dish. I would make them again. It's hard to get green beans the right consistency. This high temperature method seems to be the trick.",
