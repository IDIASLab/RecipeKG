Added 1/2 of a red bell pepper diced for color and sweetness Added about 1/4 cup of feta crumbles as this was doubling as my side dish and I needed to add tasty calories Used a mix of heritage small tomatoes that were in a pint box together at Sprouts....used about 2/3rd of the pint Used Penzey's Italian Dressing mix made with red wine vinegar (Pompeii) and extra virgin olive oil (Bertoilli) Husband declared it delicious! Next time I will cut the cauliflower into smaller pieces...I didn't think of that tonight Served with a small steak for a great quick low carb supper",
