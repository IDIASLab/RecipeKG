For me next time I'd use a better quality bacon. I used a cheap bacon and the results weren't as great as I'd hoped. My family didn't care--I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist.",

I used a regular waffle iron and had to be sure not to shut it all the way or the batter would spill out even with less batter used. I found that if I held it almost shut but not completely that the batter fluffs up so much it'll still reach the top of the iron to cook. You can also freeze leftovers in sealable bags. Just stick them in the oven at 250 degrees just til warmed. Great recipe! I even made extra bacon and ate it alone! If you're looking for a strong bacon flavor I suggest using more than what the recipe calls for.",
