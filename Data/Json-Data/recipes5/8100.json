While this recipe wasn't a fail, I had some doubts on the cook time begin too long. I erred on the side of caution and did the minimum stated time of 13 mins. They came out a little overdone for my hard-boiled tastes, where the  yolk starts getting crumbly.  Next time I'd probably take them out at 10-11 mins.  These were still tasty, but I prefer to either just use my Instant Pot using the 5-5-5 method, or bringing them to a boil in a pot, covering and then turning the heat off to let them \"cook\" in the hot water for 11-12 minutes.  TIP: for easier peeling, when draining the hot water, lightly shake the eggs around in the pot to lightly crack them. Then fill pot with cold water and let sit.",
