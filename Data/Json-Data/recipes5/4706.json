I would recommend cooking this in foil that has been sprayed because it burned a little in my pan.  I think next time I'll cut the potatoes in rounders rather than wedges, and I'll add the feta for the last minute or so of cooking time.",

I precooked the potatoes in the micro to give them a head start We are under another heat advisory again and I was using the grill outside no 400 degree oven for me tonight. I did cut back on the water since they were partially cooked but followed everything else to the T. I did have a few fresh picked green beans that needed to be used so I added that to the potatoes in my grill pan. Really wonderful and yes I will make them again!",

I did not have 80 min. to bake them so I microwaved them for 10 min on high, covered, then put them in the oven(uncovered) for 35 min until the potatoes were tender and browned. I did not have fresh mint but it tasted fantastic without it. Thanks Cyndi, great recipe",

                "reviewBody": "Oooh. SOOOO yummy!!! Made these to accompany the marinated Greek chicken kabobs (katplusgoll) I made for dinner tonight. I was thinking of taking the easy route and just opening a pouch of Uncle Ben's rice pilaf to serve on the side, but I am SOOO glad I didn't. :) I pretty much followed Cat Lady's directions to the letter except for a few minor changes. First, I halved everything since this was a side dish for two people. Second, I used the full amount of herbs called for (we like herbs!). And finally, I subbed chicken broth for water and used more of it (my potatoes seemed dry half way thru the first 40 minutes, so I added a 1/2 c. more at that point and another 1/2 c. when I added my herbs). Oh, and I also used herbed instead of plain feta (yummy!). THREE TIPS: a) if you want to prep ahead of time, simply cut your potatoes and add to a large pot of water; then add a bit of lemon juice to prevent browning, b) if you rinse / drain your potatoes and then dry (with a kitchen towel) REALLY well, you'll end up with perfectly crisp potatoes (this process removes excess starch which prevents potatoes from crisping up) and c) spread your potatoes on a WELL-GREASED, wide rimmed baking sheet and roast on the top rack of your oven (you'll also find that this helps crisp everything up, again, if you like your potatoes slightly crisp...). Thanks for sharing, Cyndi! This one's going in my \"keeper\" file for sure. :-)",

I added my oregano at the specified time but left my mint until just before serving. I wanted it to look really bright and fresh. Thanks for a great recipe! I'm already planning to make it again.",
