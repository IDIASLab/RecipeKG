I like to put the pan on med/high heat for two-three minutes before adding the oil, I used Avocado as it has a higher smoke point, then add the oil and allow it to shimmer before adding the scallops. I then dropped the heat to med. My scallops were large so I cooked for four minutes on the first side and then three on the second side. In the recipe description it says to drizzle with balsamic and basil but in the body is says to garnish with lemon zest. I went with the lemon zest as I thought that the balsamic would overpower the scallops. I served this on a garlic/parsley butter reduction. Great, simple recipe that I will make again.",
