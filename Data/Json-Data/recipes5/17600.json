I use the recipe as stated except I use ground beef and when it is formed in the pan I take my finger and poke about 3-4 holes through the top down the center, this just allows more of the sauce to absorb.  I also add 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 and sometimes I even sprinkle a little on the top of the meatloaf.  When we cut and serve I take the sauce from the pan and we spoon over our meatloaf as a sauce.  Anybody that doesn't like meatloaf definitly try this one, it tastes nothing like the traditional.  Hopefully many more will find this recipe to be great!!!!!!",

I do agree with some of the other reviews that the sauce to go on top was excessive. Literally of course. I poured the sauce over and still had a lot left, so I waited to see if I needed it while in the oven thinking that maybe the sauce would evaporate or absorb into the loaf. It didn't. You could probably half the sauce and it would be fine. But this was still the best meatloaf we have ever had. \r\n\r\nA keeper!!!",

I only had diced tomatoes on hand no sauce but I think I will do this again this way -- they chunky tomatoes were fantastic. I also followed other readers' suggestion and halved the sauce but next time I'll do the original amount (maybe it's less because of the chunky tomatoes). I baked it in a brownie pan in a dome-shape and would have enjoyed more sauce to cover it. The sauce is delicious! Very tangy and flavorful. My husband HATES meatloaf and he gobbled this up and went back for seconds! And no ketchup needed! I am adding this to my rotation!",
