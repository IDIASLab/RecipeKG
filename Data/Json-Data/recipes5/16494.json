The subtle pineapple flavor was a nice suprise that everyone enjoyed. There was plenty of \"stuffing\" left over and I added marshmellows to the top of a small casserole dish and that was gobbled up too! The only changes I may make in the future was to cut wider holes allowing more stuffing to be in the apple. I used Granny Smith which were perfect apples to use for this dish. (I also bought a bag of cinnamon hard candies since I couldn't find the \"red hots\" easily. I melted them in a crock pot with water. This worked wonderfully!)",
