Submitter directs to use egg substitute, but I couldn't go that far - I used four whole eggs. I was impressed that she called for just a small amount of olive oil, although I needed and used more like a tablespoon. And while the recipe calls for cheese, it's a reasonable amount, not gobs of it - on that I stuck to the recipe. I eliminated the red pepper flakes, giving this a few grinds of fresh ground pepper instead. All and all a great omelet - but one you will more than likely have to plan ahead for, unless you just happen to have all the ingredients at hand.",

                "reviewBody": "This is really quite good. It's more of an omelet/fritatta hybrid than a true omelet, though, because the ingredients are incorporated in to the egg mixture. I had an 8 oz container of sliced mushrooms and a bag of wilting baby spinach that needed to be used. I also had all of the other ingredients on hand, so decided to try this for dinner. The thing is, I don't use egg substitute, so I just used real eggs. 4 large eggs can be used for the 8 oz of egg substitute listed in the recipe. Because I had so many mushrooms, though, I just doubled the recipe and cooked this is in an extra large skillet - that means for a standard 8 oz container of mushrooms you'll want to use 6-8 eggs. I used 6 because that's all I had left. Everything else was doubled, as written. It turned out quite nice. The pepper flakes gave it a nice little kick without being too spicy. Be sure you chop up the onions, mushrooms and spinach in to small, even pieces. Don't toss them in whole. This is a good, simple and FAST dish for any meal. I ate my portion with a little sour cream and additional shredded cheese. This would really work well if you've got little bits of other vegetables or even proteins like leftover chicken that need to be used up. If you're having trouble getting the top to finish cooking without burning the bottom, consider placing it in a pre-heated oven",

I too substituted farm fresh eggs for the egg substitute and used coconut oil in place of olive oil. I like my omelets to have filling so I added some of the veggie mixture and cheese to the eggs but left most of it out to put in the middle. I thought it could have used more cheese but I'm a cheese lover. The red pepper flakes didn't give it as much heat as I thought they would which I'm glad of. Good simple healthy omelet that was my dinner tonight:)",
