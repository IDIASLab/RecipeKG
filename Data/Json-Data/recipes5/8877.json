That's not to say it didn't taste good, the flavors just didn't pop as much as I would have liked. When I mixed up the marinade, I did find it to be delicious though! I marinated the chicken for the minimum 1 hour, however I would suggest going longer than that for maximum flavor.  Also take care grilling the chicken; the honey tends to want to burn. Medium heat instead of medium-high helps with that.",
