Most recipies are either sweet and cakey, or dense and salty or bland.\r\n\r\nThe first batch I made followed the recipe exactly and was quite good.  It was a little salty for my taste, but delicious drizzled with honey.  \r\n\r\nOnce I had a feel for the flavor of the original recipe, I set out on my own.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp sugar and a good squeeze of honey.  It was just about ideal.  If you try it this way though, watch it carefully as it bakes.  The added sugars can make it brown very quickly.  You may want to compensate by baking it in a larger, shallower pan so that the crust doesn't brown before the center is cooked through.",

This brings back great memories of my Grandma's cooking. Perfect with a bowl of black eyed peas and a big glass of iced tea! :)",

R was great w/each preference combo & texture was incredible! My.02: SALT:Too much for amount of soda used. Forget topping the original R w/butter! We 1st used the R as is then needed to reduce the salt. I think it was a typo because the recommendation for adding salt to flour is.5tp/1c flour. There's only 1c here. Plus baking soda is a salt. With confidence you can reduce the salt to taste because the rising will be unaffected (there's no yeast in this R). BAKING TIME:16 minutes tops! I used a 9\" glass pan. With a sweetener the top and sides will burn if not watched after the 11 minute mark. As soon as you like the color place foil lightly over the CB and continue to bake. Sugar has carbon and therefore will turn to charcoal in heat; 450 is HOT and this happen fast in the R. No sugar? Start checking after 13 minutes by lightly tapping top of CB to feel if its solid. Like moist CB? Take it out as soon as it's solid. Not using CISkillets? Don't mind flour? Flour pan generously for less sticking. BAKING SODA:Baking soda can replace baking powder but reverse is NOT true. One must use bs or the CB will be flat. MILK:You can't use milk in this R. The Baking soda will only combine w/ acidic milk to form CO2 & leaven this R. MIX:Mix wet/dry separately.Combine at last sec. to retain as many CO2 bubbles as possible for the oven.",
