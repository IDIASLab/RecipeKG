Swedish meatballs are not the same as commercially prepared meatballs for sale. The seasonings in this recipe don't completely reflect what makes meatballs, well, Swedish. One of the seasonings is Grillkrydda, which isn't easily found here in the US. Allspice can be used as a substitute. Worschestire sauce and steak sauce aren't flavors that are found in authentic recipes, either. Bottom line. This is a good-tasting recipe, but please don't call them Swedish!",
