Would suggest 2 to 3 tbsp papreka, toss the green pepper and use V8 Juice instead of the tomato sauce and boullian.  Also add a scant teaspoon rpt teaspoon of chili powder.  Let cook for at least one hour on a slow simmer.  I have made this recipe for 30 years since I left germany, recently went back and put my recipe to the test and it was spot on for the area in Baveria we lived.  Some people also add mushrooms and/or a few vegetables.  However, we love it in its simplest form.  Great served with a ham and Swiss cheese open faced sandwich on buttered rye or pumpernickle. Simply, it is about the beef, onions, an flavorfull liquid.",
