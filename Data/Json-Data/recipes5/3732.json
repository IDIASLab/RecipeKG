Definitely let the tortellini marinate overnight so it really soaks up the dressing. I reserve about 1/4 cup of the dressing and drizzle over the salad before serving. Delicious!!",

Kalamata olives (1/4 cup; sliced) red onion (only 1/4 cup) pasta and dressing (1/4 cup) were tossed together and allowed to marinate all day. Before serving I mixed in feta (1 1/2 cup) grape tomatoes (1/2 cup; halved) and more dressing (another 1/4 cup). Make sure to cook your pasta al dente or it will become too soft.",
