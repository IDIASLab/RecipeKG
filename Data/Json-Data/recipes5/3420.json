We have been eating steak salads for a long time and the dressing is the only thing so far that actually tastes good with all the other flavors. I did make some changes to it though. First I omitted the walnuts and mushrooms my wife will not eat them I also added onion we love onion and then to the dressing I added 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 2 large cloves of garlic and best of all about a half teaspoon of crushed red pepper it made the dressing like a light chimchurri it was delicious.

This made for a pretty presentation. I used approx 1 cup of red leaf lettuce for more color and toasted the walnuts for a more flavor. The dressing was amazing and added extra culinary excitement with the smokey piquant flavor.I served homemade guacamole on the side which my family said really enhanced the great flavors of this salad.Thanks for sharing.This is our new favorite summertime meal.",

I like all of the ingredients in the dressing; it's just not something we could eat mixed together. Try dipping some lettuce in the mixture first before risking the whole salad.
