It made some wonderful, moist meatballs that my whole family loved.  I cut down on the red pepper by half and the black pepper by a little - I like spice but it just seemed like too much for us - and thought it had the perfect level of spice.  After baking them, I sliced them and layered them into the creamy pasta bake with tomato and basil from this site and it was a really, really good dinner! I even snuck the sour cream past my husband who doesn't like anything white and creamy  thank you for the recipe!",
