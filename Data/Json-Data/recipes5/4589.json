                "reviewBody": "I give this five stars for the taste; However I did make several adjustments due to the directions being misleading and difficult to understand. 1)Never choose any old wine for fondue.  A drier wine, which has a higher acidic content, is what you need.  NEVER use Chardonay, always use something similiar to a Sauvignon Blanc. 2)When you \"warm\" the wine DO NOT boil it. Keep it on a low-medium temperature. 3) Always, always, always shred your cheese AND allow it to sit at room temperature.  The finer shredded the cheese is, the easier it will melt. Also, add about a tablespoon of unbleached all-purpose flour to the cheese, and toss it to coat.  This helps the cheese to not \"clump' when melting. 4)Cornstarch, or a cornstarch \"mixture\", should be added BEFORE the cheese.  Add the cornstarch, and stir for several minutes giving it time to break down, and thicken.  Cheese should always be the LAST thing added to fondue. 5)Add the cheese in small handfulls, stir constantly and make sure all cheese is melted and smooth before adding your next handfull.  Otherwise, they will begin to clump together. 6)Cheese should always be cooked on low temperatures. 7)Drops of lemon juice can also be added to help break cheese down.  It also adds a nice flavor 8)Non-stick electric fondue pots are AWESOME for cheese.  Though expensive, they make cheese fondue and chocolate fondue easy because you can control your heat better. 9)Invest in the higher quality cheese, it helps",

I'm pretty simple when it comes to the fondue: Use a medium size pot start to heat it up on medium. rub garlic around the inside of the pot. pour in a thin layer of cooking wine. when you see the tiny \"carbonation\" bubbles forming around the edges slowly sprinkle in 1/2 lb shredded Gruyere cheese and 1/2 lb shredded swiss mixing as you go so it melts evenly and smoothly. I add just a small pinch of cornstarch to thicken it but not much. After the cheese is completely melted and slightly bubbling I add cracked pepper and paprika for bite. Stir it up and pour it into the fondue pot that is already heated up (low setting). Yum yum! too bad around here 1/2 lb of Greyer is 8 bucks!",

I used too much corn starch as it thickened up way too much. Not the recipes fault. Gotta watch that! I think it might have been excellent without any cornstarch. And while the basalmic added flavor...it just didn't look right. Can't find white basalmic. Of course making fondue once a year makes it hit or miss...miss this year...will keep this - interesting flavor but will look for others. Cathy",

I halve the garlic rubbed the exposed pieces on the inside of the pot and then pressed the remaining garlic pulp and left to the side. I grated all of the cheese and tossed with cornstarch and put off to the side to come up to room temperature. Once the cheese was room temp I poured in a Savignon Blanc and heated on very low flame till bubbles just started to appear on the bottom and sides of the pot stirring the entire time. I added the garlic balsamic vinegar nutmeg a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a bit of pepper. I let the everything come up to temperature then slowly added the cheese by the handful melting after each addition until all the cheese was melted and incorporated. For dipping we used a good crusty bread dried sausage pepperoni green apple and prosciutto. In the future I would probably add a jigger of good Kirsch to give it a little kick. I might also consider adding a bit of salt and increase the amount of balsamic as even with just the bread the flavor of the fondue was a bit muted. Good overall just needs a bit of tweaking.",
