Also,I  reduced the Dijon to 1 tsp simply because my five and one-year-old were eating as well. These patties took about 10 min total to cook, and I served on a bed of arugula tossed with a lemon dressing and Parmesan. Both kids devoured it and the older one said this is the only way he'll eat salmon from now on. Go figure!",

They were awesome.  3.  They're great for adding in random veggies that are about to go bad in the fridge.  4.  They're almost better cold out of the fridge at 10:30 (note: I know nothing of this fridge-raid and that's my story.)  I was out of oats, unfortunately, so I used some crushed up whole wheat crackers for the breading.  I added in just a bit of parsley, also, because I had some going bad (yay versatility!)  The lemon and Dijon gave it a great flavor - I served it with some Tzatziki sauce and they were amazing.  Expecting this to be a regular summertime dish at my house, and probably year-round after that.  Thanks!",
