Because they were breasts not thick pieces of chicken I only cooked it for a half hour total and they were perfect. I halved the butter and mixed in a Tbsp of cornstarch with the lemon juice before adding and that helped thicken it up a little but I'll add more cornstarch next time. I think the sauce was really good. Next time I'll cut up the chicken in pieces brown them and cook them on the stove and just addd the sauce to the chicken pieces serve it over rice and call it lemon chicken.:) I think that's a more suitable name for the flavor but whatever you call it it's good.",
