I was sure the \"shaggy\" part was way too much but I went ahead and smushed it into a ball anyway and rolled it out. I couldn't find my rolling pin so I had to use a wine bottle. Worked fine. It was still looking a little rough after the first addition of cheese and green onions but by the time I folded and rolled that out it looked fine. I didn't want to bother with cutting and rerolling so at the end I just rolled it out to a half-inch thick rectangle and cut it in twelve pieces. The cooking time was a bit different but unless you're using exactly the same cutter pan dimensions and composition oven atmospheric pressure and humidity and ingredient brands that's always going to be the case. That's what oven lights are for. Take them out when they look done. They tasted fantastic but the cheese and green onion layers could have been distributed a little better. Maybe next time I'll spread the cheese and onions over only 2/3 of the dough each time so there's no doubling up on the cheese when folding the dough into thirds.",
