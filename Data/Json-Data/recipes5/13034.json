We are camping in a motorhome and I was looking for a recipe using canned chicken that wasn't chicken salad. I had \"most\" of the ingredients onhand so here's what I used: 1 each 15 1/2 oz cans great northern beans and black beans about 10 oz. of salsa (what was left in the jar in the fridge) 10 oz. can of chicken about 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese - and I threw in a 4 oz. can of mild diced green chili's. I put it all in a saucepan and heated it over medium heat till the cheese melted. It was delish! I'm amazed that this simple recipe was sooooo good. I'm usually a \"from scratch\" cook but this was so good I'm going to be making it often. Thanks Nblanzy for a winner!",

I'm sure it would be better with fresh chicken but it was 11pm we were tired I was not about to simmer some chicken for what could be a 5 minute recipe. I used a reduced fat mexican cheese blend and we ate with tortilla strips and fat free sour cream. I do feel like this needed more chicken though. Even with a serving size of 2 and a 5 oz. can of chicken I felt this needed more chicken. Only 8 oz. of chicken in 72 oz. of everything else.. It just doesn't seem nearly enough. I'll make this as a quick dinner or lunch often and will try the slow cooker method soon too to see if the flavors are more prominent.",

So I added 1 Tbsp of oregano 1/4 tsp cumin 1/8 tsp chili powder 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes. The end result was delicious! A huge hit for my guests. Everyone wanted the recipe!",
