This vinaigrette is quite easy, using staples from your pantry and doesn't use salt!  Bulk up on the lemon juice for extra zing.  You can also substitute tarragon vinegar for a different feel. Serve over a tossed salad, antipasto, or as a quick marinade for beef, chicken, or pork.",

This is a keeper and I make it every weekend to last. As I like garlic I added more on the second batch, but I have to tell you, it was better with just the 2 cloves, that was perfect!
