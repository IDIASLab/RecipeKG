But not very filling. There really could and easily be more potatoes to the sausage ratio. I can see adding an additional 4 potatoes to this recipe then it would be more filling. I wouldn't change anything else but adding my suggestion of potatoes. This is a keeper. Just disappointed that it isn't more hardy and filling as submitter suggests. Just don't waive on the flavor. It's spot on with spices. And makes a wonderful broth.",

I added about 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder (would recommend 1 tsp each for a full recipe) and increased the black pepper because I always use more pepper than called for. I also used 1/2 a yellow onion instead of the green onions because it was all I had -- it boiled down nicely into the soup. If you love potatoes don't be afraid to use as many as you'd like to make it a chunky hearty soup. Experiment with different types of beer to adjust the flavor -- I used my family's standard cooking beer Pabst Blue Ribbon. Enjoy!",

Second time around (and making a double recipe!) I made the following changes: 4 lbs red potatoes peeled and 1/4 inch diced 16 oz sour cream an extra beer and 1/4 c flour. Get the 4 lbs potatoes 3 qt water and 4 beers going per directions. Put the extra beer in a large pan and reduce over medium heat to half. Add chopped kielbasa stir and simmer for 10-15 min. Pour beer/sausage into bowl return pan to med-high heat drain the sausage reserving the liquid then add 1/4 of the sausage at a time to the pan for a 3-5 minute sear. After searing transfer sausage to pot with beer potatoes and water. Add remainder of ingredients including the cheese but not the milk per recipe. Take large pan put back on med heat and deglaze with reserved liquid. Whisk in 1/4 flour until combined then add 1 qt milk in 1 cup increments until smooth (heat the milk in the microwave for 5-6 min on high). Cook this roux for 15 min over med heat until thickened. Add to pot and stir until smooth. Put 1 lb of sour cream in large bowl temper with 2-3 cups of the soup broth then add to pot. Stir to mix then enjoy. I made approximately two gallons with this recipe for a fundraiser and it was all gone in 30 minutes with many seconds-seekers turned away.",
