I would advise using only half the taco seasoning packet as it can really be salty and spicy. Another good tip is to use one or two crushed garlic cloves mixed in with the sour cream. This is actually an old recipe my grandmother used to make but she called it an Aztec Calendar because supposedly the mix of colors and textures all together resembled pictures of those ancient Aztec calendars.",

The full pack of seasoning in the beans was too much really over powering the guacamole was bland and just plain sour cream on top was a blah finish. I wouldn't reccomend this dish we threw it away there must be a better layered dip on this site. Sorry Becky I don't mean to be harsh this just wasn't it for me.",

I recommend spreading the layers on a round pizza dish though instead of a pie plate and using just half the taco seasoning or else the refried beans overwhelm the other ingredients. I tried squeezing fresh garlic into the sour cream and that was also very tasty.",
