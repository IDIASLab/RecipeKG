It's amazing how two simple ingredients that you have around the kitchen can come together for something that tastes so good. You definitely have to use REAL butter (not margarine) that's softened and you'll get great results. I used this on buttermilk biscuits but can definitely see a lot of uses for this stuff.... Thanks for a great recipe Lovesmurfs!",
