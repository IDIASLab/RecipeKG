This recipe gave me the idea to add the broth which I definately recommend for flavor as well as moisture. I buy low sodium because the sauce and taco mix already have enough. From another recipe I used half a chopped onion to line the bottom, placed the roast on top and added the enchilada sauce and a can of green chili's, broth and topped with cilantro. This made some wonderful meat to be used in burritos taco, enchilada's or just over rice and beans. It was not spicy so add some heat if you like or simply eat with hot sauce as we did.",

At 6 hours it was closer and then by 8 hours it was good to go. (I am really glad I started it at 5 AM for dinner that night.)   I used mild green salsa and I should have used medium or hot.  My chuck roast was 2 1/2 lbs, I used the full amount of salsa and taco seasoning and only one can of broth. (I could have used less broth and it would have been fine.)  I did layer thick slices of onion on the bottom of the crock pot & then fished them out before I added the shredded beef back into the juices.  Next time I will use a hotter salsa and add a couple of whole jalapenos and a bay leaf.",

I used ONLY the listed ingredients....  extremely RARE for me but I restrained myself.  In absence of the bi-focals I left it in the crock-pot for 14 hours rather than 4.  That inedible piece of meat is the tastiest thing I've eaten in a long time.  The beef soaked up all the broth and salsa and although I like it hot, the spiciness was evened out by the extended cooking.  Next on the list is chicken and pork.  As stated in prior reviews, this can be used in many different dishes....tacos, enchilladas, salads, flautas.  Simple and inexpensive.",

I'd make mine fresh and use equivalent measurements it asked for to stay true to the recipe. What I found that others were talking about how, 4 hours wasn't enough time to cook the meat. And will agree to that. There is no way 5 pounds of meat being a chuck roast will cook in a slow cooker in 4 hours. Mine was done in 7. I feel there was too much broth mixture in when it was done, I did shred the meat and place it back in the broth, but I strained out about a cup and a half of the broth and reserved it to the freezer for another time. The meat held no flavor as it was in the broth. My family said it was fine but I thought it was ok.  Sorry, it's not something I'll be making again.",
