Use it as you would taco seasoning mix from the store, two or three tablespoons of the mixture will flavor a pound of meat.",

                "reviewBody": "I have made this soup several times. This is a great recipe, but I had to have a more hearty and nutritionally balanced meal in a soup. I added black, pinto and kidney beans (I use dry beans, soaked overnight, and simmer them with the chicken, tomatoes, spices and water for an hour, but canned will work fine, too -- just be sure to drain and rinse well, then put them in the soup last ten minutes) and frozen corn in the last 15 minutes of simmering. I also boil a whole chicken with onion, salt and celery the night before, strain out the chunks, refrigerate broth, skim off fat next day, and use instead of canned broth (but breasts and canned broth works okay, too, just not as flavorful \u2013 I cut cooking time by microwaving the breasts in the canned broth instead of baking in oven, then strain broth before adding to pot). I use a large can of diced tomatoes in tomato juice, the homemade taco seasoning that was given in another review, and a cup of mild picante sauce. I crush Multi-Grain Toastitos and add with a dollop of fat-free sour cream and the avocado when serving. Fruit salad on lettuce leaves rounds it all out. Simply divine.\n\nMy changes make a lot more soup for larger families or gatherings, since you will have more broth if made with a whole chicken and/or add more water with the beans and corn. Add more spices proportionally, too. \n\nKeeps well for a week in frig. Hubby then takes it to work every day and begs for more!",

Two teaspoons of cumin!! I could accept a dash of cumin but with 2 teaspoons of cumin it tastes like cumin soup with chicken added. I do not understand the idea that all Mexican food has to have cumin in it. I made this soup and invited Mexican friends to try it. Nobody would eat it. Everything else (the avocado tortilla chips even the cheddar cheese) which are not commonly found in Mexican chicken soup would have been very acceptable if not welcome additions. Just NOT the cumin.",
