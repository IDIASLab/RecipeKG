Afterwards, in my super heavy duty roasting pan, I cooked the marinade over my gas stovetop and added more cider since I didn't add water at all. I have a photo! Husband LOVED this! My first tenderloin ever cooked and it was a great success!

I have fresh rosemary in the garden so I used that plus some fresh Oregno and dried majoram. I ran 2 long sprigs of rosemary longitudinally thru the roast and then mixed chopped fresh rosemary and oregano plus 1.5 tsp of dried majorum, 2 tsp of minced garlic, kosher salt, pepper and some olive oil. I rubbed this all over the roast and popped it in the roaster and cover the top of the roast lightly with some italian bread crumbs and added regular cider. Baked covered for an hour and then uncovered for an hour with the apples and onions and a few carrots thrown in for color. Spooned the brown sugar over the top as directed.  For the gravy, I skipped the maple syrup as the non-alcoholic cider had made the drippings sweet enough. Made the gravy with cornstarch (personal preference).  The roast was delicious and incredibly tender. I served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and homemade French Baguette garlic bread.  My wife loved it",

The only changes I made was to use half the amount of maple syrup called for, ( and that made the gravy plenty sweet enough for this sweet tooth) and I marinaded the roast in a bag (with all the air squeezed out) with apple cider (no water) and added chicken broth to the roasting pan halfway through the cooking time to make sure there was enough juice for the gravy. Also, being a garlic lover, I added two cloves of garlic with the apples and onions. Make sure you used a meat thermometer, as I find the cooking time a bit too long. Very flavourful, juicy and a definate do-again recipe!!!",

I used apple juice instead of the cider and cut the cooking time in half (just use a meat thermometer to determine when it's done so you don't \"kill\" it). The rub was a bit too much in the end; I may just add the herbs/spices to the marinade next time instead. I really loved the \"gravy \" although the pork is so flavorful you don't even need it.

First my cooking time was about 1.5 hours (instead of 2) and my apples & onions didn't cook all the way so I would suggest adding the apples after 30 minutes and let them cook until the tenderloin reaches 160 degrees. Also definitely use a meat thermometer if you have one. After I completed the gravy I added the apples and onions to it and let them cook a bit together then I served them together in a bowl with the sliced tenderloin on the side. One last tip I tied 2 tenderloins together and cooked them as one. It's the first time I've done this and it worked well.",

I then seared the porl in an oiled roasting pan for 5 minutes before adding the marinade, and I reduced the cooking time to 1 hour at 375F and the pork came out juicy and tender. The sauce did not have a strong scotch taste at all, but melded well with the maple syrup and brown sugar. My husband ate 3/4ths of the 1 1/2 pound tenderloin that I made.

                "reviewBody": "Hmmmm. This was \"OK.\" I purchased a pkg. of 2 (1 lb.) pork tenderloins a few wk. ago. I used one then but froze the other for a future meal. This past wk. I thawed the unused tenderloin b/c I wanted to try this recipe. To take the guesswork out of how long to cook my tenderloin I used my Williams-Sonoma digital thermometer set to register 160 deg. (i.e. med.). I should have cooked to 170 deg. as I like my pork well done (but my fiance likes his med. so he wins tonight!). I pretty much followed Bob's directions to the letter except for halving everything (remember I only had a 1 lb. tenderloin available) adding 2 sm. cubed sweet potatoes/3 garlic cloves & using a combo of GrannySmith/Jonagold apples & a little less maple syrup than called for (I used 1/4 c. b/c I was afraid that my gravy would be too sweet otherwise). I added my potatoes/onions/apples with the uncooked tenderloin rather than waiting until the second hr. It didn't even take an hr. for everything to cook thoroughly so I am glad I did (2 hours even for 3 lb. meat - my gosh!!!). My only regret was adding the potatoes (they didn't cook thru in the allotted time... my bad!). Note: Although I used hard cider (Woodchuck) as a marinade I'm sure regular cider or juice for that matter would work just as well. Served w/ pork stuffing garlicky green beans & dinner rolls this was a filling meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe Mr. Meyers:) This is a perfect fall dish!",
