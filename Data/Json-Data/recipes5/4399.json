We used to order shish tawook all the time at a Lebanese restaurant in our old neighborhood. Now that we've moved, we haven't found a place that serves this so I've experimented with several other recipes and they were all disappointing.  But this one is JUST RIGHT!!!  Very authentic tasting. I modified it slightly to suit our (spicy) tastes by adding more oregano, a little dried mint, turmeric, and  a couple dashes of cayenne pepper.",

Im so glad tht i made the right choice - this shish tawook chicken was delicious! It was moist and full of flavour! I added a few more cloves of garlic, reduced the cinnamon to a pinch and added a few dashes or turmeric powder, cayenne pepper and paprika.  My family had this for dinner with pita bread ( recipe from allrecipes ) and the dipping sauce ( from the other shish tawook recipe in allrecipes ) This recipe is a keeper!!",

Cardamom is not easy to find, and it is expensive, so I found on-line that a subtitute is equal parts of cinnamon and nutmeg and used that. I also do not care for black pepper so I did not add it. For the onions I went with red onions as it didn't specify. I was busy all day and they marinated a total of 10 hours. Normally over marinating chicken can cause a bitter taste, but it didn't at all. I don't have access to a grill so I broiled them in the house. I set the rack two down from the top and set the broiler to high. I lined a pan with tall sides with foil and broiled half of them at a time. For my oven it was 8 minutes, then I flipped it for 5 minutes, then one more flip for 2 minutes. Delicious!",
