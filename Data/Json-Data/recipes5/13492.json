My husband said, \"I can't stop eating this!,\" and my two four-year-olds both loved it.  \nThe way I made it was pretty true to the recipe, except that I substituted a can of pinto beans (drained and rinsed) for the mushrooms, and I did not use the creamed corn.  I prebaked the cornbread base for 10 minutes, and it turned out perfectly, not at all soggy.  The cooking time for the assembled dish was then only 30 minutes.\nI will definitely be making this again (and again and again...)!  Thanks for such a delicious recipe!",

I went to store and bought a chicken followed \"boiled chicken\" recipe on this site (by the way very good recipe); then started this meal when chicken was ready. At that point had already spent 2 hours on this meal! Anyway I took other reviewers advice and changed the following... 2 eggs instead of egg substitute 1/2 cup & a big spoonful more of sour cream instead of 1 1/2 added a can of cream of chicken soup used 2 1/2 tbl of diced green chiles & added a finely chopped jalapeno. The mushrooms were good but next time may consider cutting in half. Unfortanatley I picked up reduced fat jack cheese by mistake. Was like shredding plastic! Used a box of \"Jiffy\" cornbread mix. Unless you have helpers prep time is more like 1/2 hour. When it was finally out of the oven (3 hours later - cuz of cooking fresh chicken) - was very tasty but needed something more. Still can't figure out what. Anyway much to my surprise reheated next day & was the bomb! Some casseroles just need a day to mesh. All in all very good recipe very inventive & am very impressed! Just make sure you use whole jack cheese! Oh yeah a nice salad & some hot bread would go great with this meal. Would not suggest a vegetable rice or anything like that.",

                "reviewBody": "The cornbread was great rich and wonderful texture. The chicken mixture however was missing something. I knew the small amount of green chile would not satisfy my spice taste so I added about a teaspoon of chopped jalapeano. Still the sour cream alone did not complient the chicken--it needed more chicken flavor. Maybe a cream of chicken soup and sour cream mixture.",
