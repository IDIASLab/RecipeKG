I was convinced that even though he claimed the crunch was the real thing, there must be some sort of enhancement going on, but they really were just as beautiful and as crunchy as the ones in the video. One thing; they took far less time to cook than the recipe indicated. Probably about half the time. Next time, I'll try cutting them a bit thicker, too, as I don't think an onion ring with a little substance left in the onion is a bad thing. Also, as crunchy as these stay, you could probably take the time to make a big batch of them for a larger group and keep them warm in the oven until they were all done with no effect on the quality.",

The first time I made these I had a little trouble with the batter not sticking after they were cooked so the second time around I dredged the rings in flour as soon as they were cut and then proceeded with battering and dipping in the Panko and they were much better batter completely held together and they were the best onion rings I've had!",
