I ended up letting them cook until tender then turned up the oven to 400 and still wasnt getting anywhere. I ended up having to broil them on high stir and keep a close eye on them to get them to crisp up. They have a very good flavor the cooking method is just a bit off.",

Instead of brown sugar, I added a little vanilla extract into the olive oil.  Also- I didn't have coriander.  I added a little cumin and pumpkin pie spice to the recipe.  Yum!  If you make a little extra, these are also delicious to take from the fridge as a snack.  Many times, I find the potatoes don't cook enough from the oven alone (and they're hard to cut up uncooked), so I microwave them until soft, then cut up.  I put in oven on 400 until crispy.",

After the 30 min cooking time the recipe recommended they weren't done so I increased the temp to 400 for about 15 min. The brown sugar & spices carmelized and were beyond yummy! Update 12-04-10 -- I made these again tonight & instead of using the olive oil I used Pam Olive Oil Cooking Spray. They were still delicious & lower in fat & calories. They also were a little crisper than when I made them before. Best yet!",

As I said the family loved these twin 21 yr old sons that never agree both said it's a do-again maybe even for holiday dinner.

(It wasn't my regular BBQ chicken or steamed broccoli that was on his mind.) They are not crisp fries but about the same as any other oven baked fries. I made a few changes. I left out the sugar since I served them with a vanilla maple icing drizzle. I left the peels on and that seemed to make many of the fries more firm. I skipped the cold water and put all the ingredients in a plastic bag to coat and then sit for about 30 minutes prior to baking. That gave a nice uniform coating of spice and oil. I set my oven to 400 degrees F and baked for 40 minutes turning them at 20 minutes. Finally I put them under the broiler for a bit. Watch that step carefully. They go from perfect to burnt in a second.",

First of all I wasn't sure if I was supposed to peel them or not (I did) and who knew raw sweet potatoes were so hard to slice! I popped them in the microwave for a 1.5 minutes and that made them managable to slice. Also the recipe didn't say to spray the sheet first and being the novice chef that I am I didn't. I will next time because they stuck. The kitchen smelled great and the fries were tasty but if its all the same I'll just stick to a baked sweet potato.",
