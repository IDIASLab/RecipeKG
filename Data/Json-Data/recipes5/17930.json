I don't use quick oats either, which gives a more chewy substantial topping.  I used peaches that I had cubed and frozen, and after thawing they were quite watery.  I put them in a colander to drain most of the liquid, and then added about 1/8 cup of Minute tapioca to make sure remaining liquid would thicken up.  It was delicious and easy.

I did not have enough peaches so I added about 8 plums (the oval blue ones). the plums added a bit of sourness to the sweetness of the peaches; they also changed texture a bit. I liked the combination so much that I am going to keep it even when I do have enough peaches. You might want to add a bit more sugar if you don't like the sourness of the plums. I used plums that I bought from the local orchards; they are superior to the store variety. I would not add fruit from the supermarket to this recipe. 2. I used organic nut/maple granola. I liked it because it had different nuts and seeds: sliced almonds sunflower seeds cashews... Aslo the maple flavor goes well with the rest. 3. I added walnuts instead of pecans and that worked just as fine. 4. my husband does not like cinnamon so I added a bit of freshly ground clove. I like the zest that it adds to the overall flavor. But do not add too much; it is very strong. I recommend this recipe to those who like making easy treats with the fruit in season.",
