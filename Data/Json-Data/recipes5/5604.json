I followed the recipe to the letter for the most part, but when I was getting ready to cook the chicken, I realized that I forgot to put the oregano in the brine.  Oops!  \n\nWhen the cooking time was done, the chicken looked a little too white for me and since I like crisp skin, I decided to broil the chicken.  I broiled it for about 5 minutes and I achieved what I wanted.\n\nTo keep my carb count down, I substituted one tablespoon of corn starch for the flour in the sauce.  \n\nArmando, my better half (?) rated this recipe a 9 out of ten.  He does not rate very many meals this high.  All in all, a very good dinner that will grace my kitchen table again.",

One Suggestion: Toward the end of baking if you move the lemon slices that have been covering the chicken thighs (keep them with the chicken in the baking dish but not on top) then baste each thigh with the pan juices and bake another five minutes or so you end up with rich golden brown crispy skin that not only looks better but tastes better too! (Because I'm on a low sodium diet I omitted the salt entirely used a little more garlic powder than the recipe called for (I didn't have \"rosemary garlic seasoning\" so I used rosemary and garlic powder combined) and marinated the chicken overnight. Between the lemon juice seasoning herbs and long marinating time it still had enough flavor (for me at least) without even needing the salt.)",

                "reviewBody": "I made this exactly per the recipe and it was good. It was lemony but not overpowering and the other spices were fine too. Just no wow factor and while satisfying I would not say that it's delicious. I discarded the marinade as indicated. There was no indication of whether to bake covered or uncovered so I covered my baking pan with aluminum foil. There was about a half cup of liquid pan drippings when it was done and I made the mistake of using the pan drippings to steam the kale in my vegetable side dish... this made the kale way to salty and lemony and ruined it (I was able to salvage it by rinsing it and reheating it in the microwave but it wasn't edible without doing this). So I recommend making sure you drain the chicken well and throw out the pan drippings. And if you don't cook covered you likely won't have any pan drippings and all that salt that doesn't wash off the chicken will likely make it too salty so it probably either needs to be baked covered or have some water added to insure there is sufficient liquid to remove some of the salt from the chicken. While good enough to enjoy once this recipe just isn't one that merits trying again.",
