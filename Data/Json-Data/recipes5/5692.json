In retrospect, that may have been too high of an oven for the amount of time this entire dish is supposed to bake.  Next time, if I left the temp as I did, I would not cook the broccoli first and only slightly brown the chicken, before adding it to the baking dish.  The broccoli was mushy, which I don't care for veggies cooked this well.  But overall, the recipe was easy and tasty and I really think it has a lot of potential.",

My only change was baking it w/ my rice already pre-cooked as a layer in the casserole dish. (Put it all together ahead of time so that I could pull it out of the oven and serve w/o minimal effort.) To make it 4 or 5 stars I would add curry lemon juice and sauteed onions and decrease the bread crumbs a bit.",
