This stew tastes amazing, even with the less expensive/fancy fish. Very flavorful, nice and spicy (without being overwhelming so). I normally can't stand my own cooking, but this dish tasted like I'd ordered it at a pricey restaurant. My husband took leftovers to work and coworkers asked where he'd gone out to eat the night before because it smelled so good. \n\nMaking it again tonight, I'll be sure to snap a photo this time!",

I used 1 full teaspoon of cayenne for the perfect heat.  Not only does this dish look incredible with it vibrant colors but has a very nice, kind of exotic, dark, smokey flavor with just a hint of heat. My wife said it looks and tastes like something from a nice restaurant and that she would pay for a bowl of it if on a menu.  Great stuff, this is going in the \"keeper\" file!\n\n**Update: I just made a batch tonight with some blackened chicken breast. I dare say it tastes even better than the fish batch...  awesome flavor! I blackened the chicken breasts (the kind you get in 3lb bags frozen) separately on a foreman grill,. I  coated the chicken with olive oil and then used a home made blackening rub (using smoked paprika).",

In fact we may prefer the catfish but then we're catfish lovers preparing it in many ways. This is one to try. Do watch the video at least once.",
