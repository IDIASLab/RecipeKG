I added in some green and orange bell peppers because I needed to use them and it came out fabulously. I also may have thrown in some cottage cheese along with the shredded cheese (okay I did. And it was great.) My husband wanted to take the leftovers for lunch which NEVER HAPPENS! I've made different variations of this for a while now and I can say that it's a fairly quick weeknight meal and the fact that it's so versatile is truly my favorite part. I've even added black beans when I didn't have ground beef and made it vegetarian. You know it's a keeper when your out-of-town friends request it every time they come visit:)",
