I used penne pasta and instead of heating the garlic and lemon juice in olive oil, I used minced garlic from the jar and whisked the \"dressing\" in a small bowl.  I added a bit more lemon juice and some lemon zest.  Once the broccoli and pasta were done, I tossed everything together and used a combination of parmesan and romano cheeses.  This was a perfect light side dish to accompany \"Apple Cider Chicken Marinade\" from this site. Note: If you want to add a little kick to this dish sprinkle a bit of crushed red pepper flakes on top!",
