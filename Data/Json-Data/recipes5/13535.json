I used 1/2 cup of egg substitute and 2 whole eggs as egg substitute tends to be a little watery. I fried a little green pepper along with the onion and added a little chopped tomato to get in some extra veggies. I also used minced garlic vs. garlic powder. You could easily but this inside a tortilla for a really awesome breakfast wrap! This recipe is a definite keeper!",

My husband likes his eggs over-easy, so wasn't sure how he would like this.  Asked him to rate:  make again, eat if I make it, or never again.  He said Make Again, so this is a keeper!",
