In my opinion, it is not a side dish as I saw someone else thought it should be used for.  \r\nBut, I do make it a bit different and don't know if it's better because of the changes.  \r\nI fry the bacon seperate from the ground beef and cook it until crisp, but not burnt.  Then I brown the ground beef.  It will take longer then cooking them together, but recipe is very good when the bacon is cooked crisp.  I also mix the brown sugar (1 C) with the ketchup to form a sauce.  I then mix all the ingredients.  I also do not use mustard or vinegar and it is always a huge hit!\r\nI saw some commented that they disliked the butter beans.  Although I like the butter beans I always try to find baby butter beans since there not so big.  Really much better in this dish then regular butter beans.",

I drained the two other cans of beans, one was kidney, one was pinto. I used a pound of bacon, fried it crisp and crumbled it into the beans when everything was mixed.  In the bacon grease, I sauteed 1/2 cup onion, 1/2 cup green pepper, and 1/2 cup red pepper.  My family loved it and I am making it for the third time in two weeks.  My older sons fought over who was taking the little bit of leftovers home. You have to try it!!  Easy and delicious.",
