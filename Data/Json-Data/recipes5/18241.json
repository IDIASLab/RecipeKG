I wasn't sure where the recipe was going with the worchestershire sauce and all that savory stuff but boy oh boy this comes together to make a dish that is very tasty and classier than all those Sunday brunch easy-cheesy egg creations. I will keep this close at hand for future reference YUM! Be sure and use a firm bread I didnt have any stale bread so i just left mine out for a couple hours to dry out. The thing I liked about this is that you make it the night before (or longer) and it lets you make other wonderful fresh things to go with it a great helper for that spectacular brunch you are planning.",

I recommend more butter using french bread and putting a cover on until the last 15 minutes so that the cheese doesn't burn. You will need more than 1 hour to cook this. I also recommend adding meats or vegetables like ham sauteed spinach or mushrooms that have been pressed to remove water. The savoury flavor is a 5 though.",

I also added 1 1/2 cups of chopped ham and 1 cup of chopped onion layered like the other ingredients. It was the perfect amount for the dish. I also cut the crusts off before baking - maybe not necessary but I wanted it to look elegant. It took a lot longer to bake than 1 hour but I had two in the oven at the same time (2 hrs. total bake time). I did loosely cover it with foil for the first hour and the browning was just right. Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making this again.",

But alas every chef has to mess with perfection.... I added 1 pound of browned breakfast sausage to which was added 1/2 medium chopped onion and 1/2 medium chopped green bell pepper - and a small can of drained mushrooms.... mmmmmm. The additions are not necessary... but I believe toasting your bread first (don't just rely on day old being dry enough) is the key to a great quality strata with just the right consistency. This was the best strata I ever made... and was twice as nice the next day.",
