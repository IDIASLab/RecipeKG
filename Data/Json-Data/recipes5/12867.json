I steamed mine for 8 minutes instead of boiling but I don't think it would make a huge difference. I didn't have any cream but didn't substitute anything either. I eyeballed everything in the sauce pretty much but the quote from the husband is \"hardly ever does a vegetable taste that good\". It seems to have a cabbage-like flavor over potato-like texture. I'll be saving this and will serve it to company at next chance. A warning to those who are new to the lumpy purple thing like me: there were some infrequent fibrous bits present which I attributed to my being a kohlrabi-peeling novice.",

If you have too many bulbs for the number of people you can freeze them (raw or cooked without the sauce) in a freezer bag for another time.",

I couldn't find any here in the US but I grew some myself this year. Just like cabbage (which it is) it grows well and is one hearty plant. I don't remember it tasting so much like cabbage in fact at the time I had no idea it was cabbage but she sliced it thinner than I did and I believe she cooked it more than I did. Next time I'll boil it longer and maybe not save the 1 cup water. I've got more Kohlrabi so I'll perfect it over time. I tried to go conservative on salt and pepper due to another review but needed to add more after it was done. I added a little black pepper too. The seasoning depends on how much Kohlrabi you have etc so you have to season to taste. It was good but I think the good company also made it better in Germany.",

I recommend making this with less than the listed amount of kohlrabi - I used only one but kept the rest of the recipe the same (needed a touch more flour to thicken the sauce though.) It makes it very saucy which is great for ladling over sauteed scalloped potatoes. Yum! This recipe has made me a die hard kohlrabi fan! Thanks!",
