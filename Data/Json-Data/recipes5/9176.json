I used Half and Half to lower the fat content and found it quite suitable. In fact, the pumpkin puree is so smooth and rich, I feel even a low fat 2% milk or even water would suffice. I have yet to experiment! I found it difficult to cut and cube the sweet pumpkin raw, so I seeded it and cut it in half, drizzled it with oil and baked it in the oven with the other vegetables with the skin on. After 40 minutes or so the skin just fell off and I could continue baking the pumpkin until nice and soft. I am also going to try adding a few cloves of garlic to the roasted vegetables to give it some added zing next time! One last word of caution...watch the nutmeg. It gives the soup a real nice flavor, but too much can be overpowering. I really recommend giving this soup a try...it is rich and flavor-some and quite easy to prepare. \r\n",

I added a couple of large garlic bulbs to the roasting vegetables and squeezed out the roasted cloves to add in when pureeing the soup.  Only used 1 teaspoon nutmeg based on 4kg pumpkin.  The roasted flavor was distinctive, and the soup was not sweet.  The roasted garlic flavour came through strongly due to the quantity I used - but would do the same again!  The best pumpkin soup I've ever made - and I've made plenty!  My family loves soup - this will become a regular.",

The first time I made it I didn't have any nutmeg on hand but I did have garam masala and it went even better with the soup. Also 2% or skim milk work just fine if you're watching calories. Also if you overcook the veggies a bit the onions get caramelized and add a nice richness to the soup",
