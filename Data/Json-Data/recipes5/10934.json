The meat came off the bones easily, and I used the carcass and wings for stock. Honestly though, making the foil \u201ccups\u201d was the worst. I think the next time I make this, I\u2019m going to try placing the boneless hens in ramekins to roast. \nThe hens browned nicely and were very tender.",
