I mixed the marinade (which I doubled to be sure to cover all the chicken) threw in the chicken and let it marinate for 5 hours. I put some crushed garlic (just smash the garlic clove with a knife or bottom of a pan) into the marinade to give it a little kick. I also added grape tomatoes, onions and green bellpeppers to the skewers because we love grilled veggies over here.  SOOOOO easy for those who don't have a lot of time in the kitchen. Just throw together all the ingredients and marinate. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! I am going to try it with sirloin next time. A+++ job Angie!!",

From reading other reviewers comments, I'd like to add that if you boil your bacon for about 5 minutes before you wrap your chicken, it cooks more evenly and won't burn before the chicken is finished. Also for those who like a little kick, add a slice of pickled jalapeno inside each kabob. The sweetness of the honey and the kick of jalapeno are a great combo",

He also told half of his softball team about the kabobs and now they all want to come over to try some this weekend after their softball tournaments!!
