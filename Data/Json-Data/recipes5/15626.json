It was really easy to skin it when it was warm. Once you remove the main skin there is another layer of fatty skin underneath; you can either leave it on or take it off with a knife. In the stew recipe I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil I reduced the onion and the taco seasoning just a little bit because the beef tongue was a bit under two pounds. It had a great flavor and was not over powering at all. I thought this would taste too much like taco filling but it didn't. I will certainly be making this again!!",
