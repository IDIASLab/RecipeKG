I made a few changes:  I used half -n-half instead of heavy cream (still Keto Friendly) and like others, I cooked the bacon ahead of time.  I also baked it about 20 minutes and then added the bacon and cheese on top, rather than inside the casserole.  I served it with traditional hamburger toppings on the side.  It was lovely and will definitely make again.",

I realized halfway through that, although I made \"this dish\" before, I had gotten the recipe from Buns in the Oven, which called for a few additional ingredients. So I altered this recipe by adding a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, 2 tbs of ketchup, 1 1/2 tbs of mustard and about 3 oz of cream cheese from BITO's recipe since my family and I enjoyed it so much. I also used the chopped garlic in a jar equivalent of the garlic cloves and sauteed diced onions in lieu of onion powder. I also cooked my bacon before adding it to avoid extra grease.  It came out delicious! I baked @ 375\u00b0 for 30 minutes (the recipe doesn't list a degree for baking so I got that from the comments section here). Absolutely a favorite dish...one I'll happily make again. It's such a great meal Keto followers won't feel deprived in the least!",

It\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d I posted two accidental reviews!) serve it with sour cream and Tabasco on top. It\u2019s so delicious that way and still low carb. Season up the meat the way you like it too. I used a bunch of chili powder with the rest of the spices. For first time cooks, don\u2019t forget to COOK THE BACON first. I cook mine on a THIN cookie sheet with aluminum foil on top in the middle rack of the oven at 350 for 20 minutes. It usually comes out incredible. Do NOT use a thick baking sheet. It will burn the bacon. Do NOT put it on the bottom rack. It will burn the bacon. Middle or top rack for 20 minutes and check on it often. Careful removing it from the oven as you will have plenty of grease in the cookie sheet.",

                "reviewBody": "Very good with some changes based on other reviews and my preferences.  First, it's just me here so I essentially cut recipe in half.  I used 3 large cloves of minced garlic and a medium chopped onion, all cooked with the beef.  Added a bit of chili powder, ground cayenne pepper and a dash of Worcestershire.  I used 2-3 TBS bacon grease to brown beef and drained it thoroughly when done.  I also cooked chopped bacon separately until really crisp and drained thoroughly on paper towels.  Poured into casserole dish sprayed with PAM, added bacon.  Used about 1/4 of an 8 oz brick of Philly Cream Cheese, pinching off small pieces and \"poking\" into the beef mixture.  Used 3 large eggs with cream, added some Monterey Jack to my Cheddar cheese.  Poured over per directions, topped with cheese mixture, baked.\nThis is a great recipe - can be modified to suit your individual preferences.  May try with half beef/ half breakfast sausage next time.   Nothing greasy about mine but I did drain everything really well.  This will be one of my \"regulars\" - good, easy, cheap.  What's not to like?  :)",
