I used 3 zucchini and 1 yellow squash but definitely needed more zoodles- It must depend on the size of the squash. Next time I will use more fresh basil. There was plenty of lemon flavor without the added squirt of lemon. LastlyI, made sure my tomatoes were room temperature(I never refrigerate them) and sprinkled some fresh parmesan over each plate.",

It had a fresh clean light taste that was unexpected for a cream sauce dish. It was satisfying but did not sit heavy on the stomach. We paired it with a light red wine. I wouldn't change the recipe much next time except maybe adding some black olives and thickening the sauce slightly. It would have been delicious to have some breadsticks to dip in the leftover sauce... but we chose this dish specifically because we are cutting back on carbs like pasta and bread so I resisted the temptation.",
