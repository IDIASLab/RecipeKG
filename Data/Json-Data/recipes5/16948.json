The way I did it: Pour about 2 cups of gingerale into a frying pan; \"saute\" (technically more like \"boil\") the kielbasa for a few minutes. Take out and set aside. Add sliced onions mushrooms and a red pepper; add enough ginger ale to cover veggies then cover the frying pan and simmer until softened. While veggies are boiling arrange kielbasa on a cookie sheet and add brown sugar. When veggies are softened remove and add to cookie sheet; put the whole thing in to broil. While it's broiling mix about 1 tbsp cornstarch with some cool ginger ale then mix into the ginger ale still in the frying pan; boil until sauce is thickened. When the broiling is done add veggies and kielbasa to the ginger ale sauce. Put into pitas with a squirt of honey mustard sauce and serve.",

I followed the directions exactly except that I reduced the amount of ginger ale to 1 cup. \"Saute\" isn't accurate; you let the kielbasa boil in the ginger ale until it cooks away and leaves a sweet glaze on the kielbasa; then when the brown sugar is added and broiled it makes a sweet crust. I was really surprised! I served it with the \"Honey Mustard Dressing II\" from this site which is another great recipe.",

We were making a meal of it so I simmered onions red bell peppers and some asparagus in the gingerale after taking out the sausage. I cooked onions first until the liquid was cooked waaay down as we like our veggies kind of crispy. Just cooked to a nice thick sauce. The veggies were delicious and the sausage was very tasty As the recipe submitter said it was a great combination of sweet and salty. My favorite way to have sausage. (I used the light Turkey Polish Sausage) Will do again often as it was so fast and easy. THANKS FOR THIS ONE!",
