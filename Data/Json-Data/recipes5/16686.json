This recipe IS CORRECT!! The thing that some people might not have noticed as I have done the very same thing on many a recipe is the pan size. That is a HUGE pan. 14x 17 is not your normal size on a bar type recipe so I think maybe that could trip you up. My pan was 13 x 18 and the dough didn't quite reach all corners but it cooked out beautifully. These do indeed cook in 10 minutes in a HUGE pan pan at 400 degrees. The dough should seem like a thin layer it will puff up while baking. You will likely need to press it out as you fill your pan. They are absolutely divine!",
