For anyone who had issues with it being 'runny' make sure you don't omit the lemon juice as it reacts with the condensed milk and cream cheese to make it thick. Also as the whipping cream needs to be whipped you cannot sub it with half and half. However in a pinch I have subbed it with cool whip. Looks great drizzled with fudge sauce and peanut butter cups cut in half!",

Probably because of this the peanut butter part ended up pretty soft and I had to keep it in the freezer. It was delicious though!
