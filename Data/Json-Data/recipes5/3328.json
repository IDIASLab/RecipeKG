I made a few minor changes which reflect what was available in my kitchen: I used Vanilla soy milk instead of milk replaced the lemon juice with Key lime juice and baked it in a jelly roll style pan to lessen the cooking time. Mine took about 20 to 25 minutes and oh goodness it's excellent! It has the texture of the cream cheese poundcake I make with out the extra fat. We ate it as dessert with sugared strawberries and whipped cream spooned over the top and have been attacking it plain since. The flavor is exactly like a perfectly smooth and soft sugar cookie.",

I could not taste any lemon or butter. I doubt I will make again but if you are in the market for a light somewhat bland not that sweet pound cake then this is perfect. I can imagine that this would be great with sugared fruit etc. as a topping. By the way I baked this in a bundt pan for 70 minutes and the edges had already started to burn a tad.",
