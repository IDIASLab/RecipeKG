I ended up using vanilla yogurt instead of plain added walnuts and instead of cinnamon and nutmeg I used lemon zest so that it would have an extra lemon-y flavor. Next time I think I will add more yogurt since the consistency of the batter was a bit thick (maybe I added too many dry ingredients) and I will definitely turn the heat down! I baked it at 370 for 36-37 minutes and the top got a bit burnt! Will set it at 350 next time.",

I made mini muffins mini loaves and a regular sized loaf. The mini muffins were done at 15 min the mini loaves at 25 and apparently the regular loaf probably should've been 30-35 min not 50. I used peach yogurt (all I had) and used 3 6 oz containers. I think I'd add one more egg next time to make the batter a little more runny and/or add some fruit. It's good but there's no overall fruity lemony or specific flavors. Thanks for the recipe!",
