Reduce the olive oil to 1 to 3 tbsps.  Use a \"no stick\" spray for both the almonds and the chicken when browning.  Omit the butter altogether and increase the cornstarch to a tbsp and the marmelade to 4 tbsp.  Delicious AND Healthy!!!",

I thought the amount of almonds(1 cup) must be a misprint.? I toasted them but only used 1/4 c. which was plenty for our tastes. Seems like I dirtied more dishes (measuring cups spoons pan etc.) than neccesary too. I will try to re-use things next time. Next time I will use some of the juiced lemons ZEST also a little white wine some low-sodium boullion AND LESS OIL. It was very oily and I don't think it was necesary to use that much. I cut the chicken breasts into strips instead of leaving them whole. It was much FASTER cooking that way and the marinade flavor was almost all through the chicken better. With changes this might be a 5 star!",
