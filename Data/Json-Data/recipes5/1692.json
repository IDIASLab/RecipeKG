After reading the other reviews, I followed their advice and doubled the amount of sauce to two jars.  I also kicked up the garlic a tiny bit and used a combo of ground beef and ground, Italian sausage.  I found real, block provolone and shredded that, but I'm sure that it would have worked to simply dice up some sliced provolone from the deli, if necessary.  To save the mess of an extra pan to clean, I first saut\u00e9ed the garlic and onions, then transferred them to the saucepot.  After browning the meat and draining it, I added the sauce and meat combo to the garlic & onions.  I also precooked the noodles about 5-6 minutes so that they wouldn't soak up too much of the sauce, and baked for 35 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered.  Perfect!  I was worried the whole time that the noodles wouldn't cook properly, or that it would dry out, but it didn't need any extra sauce on the side since I'd doubled the amount to begin with.  The addition of sausage and second jar of sauce was key.  Can't wait to have leftovers!  Thanks for this great recipe!",

I omitted the provolone, since I didn't have any left.  I mixed together in a bowl 1 500g tub of extra smooth ricotta and 1 250g tub of cottage cheese.  I added some parsley and black pepper to the cheese mixture.  I layered mine sauce, pasta, sauce, pasta, cheese, pasta, sauce.  I then sprinkled some grated mozzarella and a bit of old cheddar on top.  I used the oven ready lasagna noodles for this and had no problem at all.  Baked it at 350 for about an hour, uncovered. \r\nI actually used 2 8\" square foil pans and for this recipe.  Had one the next night for dinner and the other one is frozen.  My boyfiend, who is Italian, LOVED this lasagna.  So did his mother!! ;)",

I also used small curd cottage cheese and I added 1/3 c. of Kraft parmesan cheese in with the cottage cheese and eggs. Really tasty lasagna. The provolone really was a surprize to me. It made the lasagna taste a little creamier if that makes sense. I liked that when I made this the lasagna wasn't too wet and it didn't fall apart when cut. I think using your own sauce is key.",

This is very easy to throw together and perfect for a hearty weeknight meal. So if your're in the mood for Italian but think you don't have the time - think again. I used 1 lb. of ground beef and 1 lb. of mild Italian sausage. I also doubled the sauce using Classico Marinara and added a little red wine and some fresh basil to give a bit of a flavor boost. I just layered everything as I usually do using no boil lasagna noodles which really makes things easy and topped it with a mix of shredded Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses. Great with garlic bread!
