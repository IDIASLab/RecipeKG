I was looking for a way to use up some stew beef I had in the freezer but didn't want to make that potatoes and carrots gravy type stew during the heat of summer. I followed the recipe almost to a tee except I didn't brown the meat and cooked it in the slow cooker used sherry for half the water amount used bottled lemon juice and added the pineapple as other reviewers had suggested. I also added some cornstarch towards the end to thicken the sauce a bit. I will definetly make this again. But be warned these surprisingly small amounts of honey lemon juice mustard and ketchup do make for a subtle sweet and sour oriental type sauce and it isn't at all what you expect for \"stew\". Next time I think I will dust the meat with flour or cornstarch. Yes serve with rice set the places with chopsticks and pass the soy sauce. Tell hubby it's \"pepper steak\" and forget the word \"stew\".",

Definitely a keeper recipe for stew that's a little different than the usual.",

I browned the meat and then instead of baking it I put it into my slow cooker and put 2 T. of instant tapioca into the sauce which then thickened as it was slow cooking. I added the chopped green pepper about 1/2 before serving. This way the pepper was not mush. My husband loved this recipe as did my elderly mother. I served it with rice but think it would go good with Yuca. I did add 2 cloves of garlic as I felt it was missing something. The sauce was excellent and enough. I think if you bake it there may not be enough gravy. It's a Keeper.",
