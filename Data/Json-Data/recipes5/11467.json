We went to a pumpkin farm on Halloween and they had all pumpkins 5 for $5 so we bought the largest 5 we could find. We had so many seeds (10+ cups) that we were going to try several recipes. This was the first and my family told me to just make them all this way they loved them so much.   I found the recipe to be very flexible. First batch I used olive oil instead of butter and added garlic salt as some recommended..FABULOUS! Second batch, ran out of olive oil so half canola..still fabulous! I didn't watch the time closely but baked each batch during a one hour tv show..stirred at the halfway point. I fast forwarded commercials so probably about 45 minutes.   My only recommendation..I boiled in salt water for about 10-15 minutes and then let soak for about 10 more, while I was getting things ready. I have tried drying and/or soaking overnight..no difference..just longer and more hassle. I didn't find them too salty but I like salty anyway..I have tried making them in the past without doing this and they don't taste as flavorful.",

Instead of soaking the seeds overnight, I decided to \"quick brine\" them.  I boiled them in a brine solution (very salty water) for 10 mn, removed them from heat and let them sit in the hot water for another 10 mn.  I patted them dry and immediately tossed them in the ingredients listed.  I let it sit for about an hour (it soaks up the flavor better).  Then I roasted them at 275 for an hour (to compensate for the moister seed).  They were PERFECT.  I'll be doing this every year.",
