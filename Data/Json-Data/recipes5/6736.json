The outcome was the most subtle hint of rose and a bit of a lemon aftertaste. I think these are a perfect amount of sweetness. I baked for two hours then left them in until cooled. They came out light and crispy. They crumble easily but you can bite into them without them disintegrating. What a great recipe. Next time I'm adding chocolate or dipping them in white chocolate...

The rose flavor balances beautifully with the lemon giving it a taste i am sure french royalty would have loved! I added some pink food colouring to the mixer (paste form) and that makes them even more lovely! 5/5. So dam impressed!",
