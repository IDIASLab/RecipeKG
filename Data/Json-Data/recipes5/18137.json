I did make a few changes, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to the fruit mixture.  Even after letting it sit for 15 minutes after coming out of the oven the filling was still kind of liquidy so I think next time I will use 2 tablespoons cornstarch.  For the topping I used 1/4 cup brown sugar splenda blend.  I also think that a few more minutes of baking time would have been better to ensure that the rhubarb was tender.  But I'm definitely keeping this recipe.  It's absolutely delicious.  I had to convince my husband to not eat it all in one sitting!",

I did not add honey to the fruit mixture - but I did microwave the fruit for about 8-10 minutes - to soften it a bit - otherwise I have found that the rhubarb or the apples have stayed too firm but I couldn't leave it in the oven any longer for fear it might burn. I use canola oil instead of the margering in the crunch topping. Usually I use 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce to reduce the fat in the crunch and it does not come out soggy. I also make 4x the topping and spread 1/2 on the bottom of my ceramic dish fill the middle with the fruit and then sprinkle the top with the rest of the topping. This dish is great served warm or even at room temprature! It freezes well.",

I did use an extra tbsp or so of honey because the person I was making it for doesn't like rhubarb  desserts to be too tart. I was glad I did, otherwise it may have been too tart even for me. I added 2 tbsp of cornstarch after reading the previous reviews and it was perfect - not too runny in the least. For the topping I used 1/8 cup butter and 1/8 cup light margarine and it turned out really well. Delicious with vanilla ice cream!! I'll make this again for sure.",
