It's so much easier than making apple pie and tastes almost the same. The topping is poured over the apples and bakes up very much like a pie crust, but there was not enough to cover the apples in this recipe. But it tasted really good and brought back good memories. The only substitution I made was butter in the topping instead of shortening. I haven't cooked with shortening for many years. I'll be making this again.",
