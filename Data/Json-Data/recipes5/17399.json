I did reduce the sugar and would reduce it even more next time. I didn't have any chile sauce so I used ketchup and some hot sauce, a nice dry red wine and half a can of beef broth. Cooked these ribs in my crock pot on high for 2 hours and then on low for about 4 hours. The bones all fell out of the meat and I didn't even need a knife to cut through! Be sure to skim the fat off before you boil the sauce at the end of cooking. Served this with mashed yukon gold potatoes to catch all that yummy gravy and steamed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. Next time I will reduce the sugar a little more and maybe add a bay leaf and some herbs like rosemary and thyme. Can't wait to attack those leftovers tomorrow!",

I made these for a potluck dinner at church and all that was left were a couple of rib bones and some sauce.  I didn't find it necessary to thicken the sauce at the end with the flour-water mixture.  Also, I took a hint from another slow cooker recipe for short ribs and cooked these the day before, then refrigerated overnight.  All the fat congealed on the top and was easy to remove.  I then just reheated for the dinner.",

Set half of the sauce aside. About 30 to 60 mins. before serving I strain the sauce from the crock pot and add the sauce that I had set aside. I freeze the strained sauce in an ice cube tray after frozen I put into a freezer bag and put one or two into beef soups and gravy. Good luck and thanks for the recipe.",

As a note, I made with boneless short ribs and they kind of fell apart they were so tender, which was perfect over teh mashed potatos....reminds me of something you might get in a soul food restaurant down in the south, oddly....A must try!!! oh and have your butcher at your grocery store trim all the fat off of the short ribs ahead of time, takes them about a minute and cuts down on the fat...I had no fat buildup by doing this...they do it for free, you just have to ask!",
