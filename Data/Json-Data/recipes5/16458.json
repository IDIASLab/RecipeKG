I wish this rating system was more specific for taste it deserves a 4 stars presentation 5 but as far as preparation is concerned the size of the pumpkin needs to be more specific. Mine luckily just fit the amount of ingredients but the cooking time and temp were way off. After 2 hours it wasn't even slightly done but I took anothers suggestion and nuked it for 4 minutes to set the custard which worked but i think this recipe needs to be tweaked.",

It was however gorgeous the custard did not look grey as I grated my nutmeg myself instead of using ready grinded one which may be responsible for the grey custard some had. Pumpkin started to slpit as it had to cook so much more for custard to set so I presented it with a pretty sash tied round it an no one noticed the problem. I will in future start cooking the custard in a pan and put semi-set in pumpkin. Also I recommand cooking the lid separately upside down on the baking sheet as it seems partly responsible for custard taking so long to set. On the whole I strongly recommand this recipe it was a hit here in France and dinners ate the whole lot!",

As a matter of fact I even cooked the pumpkin as long as possible (without it disentegrating) and still the custard did not form! The pumpkin seemed to make an excellent insulator against the heat of the oven. I had to end up pouring the custard mixture into a saucepan and cooking it that way. Then I returned it to the pumpkin. It did make a lovely centerpiece on the dinner table and I enjoyed it very much. However some friends were turned off when I scooped some of the pumpkin onto their plate and they would only eat the actual pumpkin. All the kids loved it though! Overall: Yummy but too much work. I will try thinning the pumpkin more next time in hopes of improving the cooking time. Yes I will try it again! If still no luck I will stick to pumpkin pie.",
