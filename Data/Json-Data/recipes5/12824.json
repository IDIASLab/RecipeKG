I took goodie plates to my sisters and brother and she was quite disapointed when I told her that these werent on her plate. Next time I think that I will dip them in carmel before rolling in the nuts to help the nuts stick better. I also shaped them into little balls instead of logw because the logs were harder to roll in the pecans. They streched out as I rolled.",

The flavor is good and sweet. However you could not work the kneading process by hand it was like epic sticky slime. And adding the pecans to it...was hard the pecans wouldn't stick and rolling it into logs wouldn't even hold up either. BUT thanks to my mom who came in to visit while I was trying this recipe out to show me how it was suppose to be done. And thankfully I was able to make it work but adding at least an addition 1/2 pound of confectioners sugar to knead into the existing batch but it still dried if pieces were small and that was fine. It better worked by kneaded the pecans into the batch verses trying to roll them on the outside. However I ended up repurposing the leftovers into other ways of making candy. BUT as is....the recipe is more work needs more confectioner's sugar.",
