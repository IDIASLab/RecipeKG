If you sear the 2nd side first & then put it in the oven that side will continue past browning and on to burning.",

Depending on thickness of steak and personal preference for doneness, times can be adjusted up or down. Just keep in mind that when cooking at such a high heat steak can easily get overdone. Place dry (no added oil) cast iron skillet in oven and heat to 500 degrees. Bring steaks to room temperature. When oven has reached 500 degrees, pat steaks dry with paper towel, lightly oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides. Remove skillet from oven, place on stovetop, add steaks and cook on high heat for 30 seconds each side  to sear. Put skillet with steaks back into oven. Cook for 2 minutes, flip steak and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from oven and let steaks rest in skillet lightly tented for 3-5 minutes. If desired, top with small knob of butter and add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.",
