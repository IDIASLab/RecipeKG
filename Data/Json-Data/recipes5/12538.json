These were just adorable like their namesake 'tot.'\" My daughter and husband perked up at hearing \"Tots!\" w/ dinner and I thought these wouldn't disappoint as whether it's shredded potato or shredded zucchini we love both smooshed baked and/or fried in any shape. But these were just too heavily seasoned w/ too many unnecessary spices and herbs. I'm just realizing now that I used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar too and maybe I'm glad for that since all of the flavors seem to jive in a more Italian style than cheddar-ey. The texture was more soft and quiche-like even though I baked them closer to 30 min. so if I was to make a similar recipe I would drastically simplify the spices and herbs possibly increase the bread crumbs and bake a little longer. But they were cute and maybe would've been better suited as a quick hors d'oeuvres bite rather than a full side dish.",
