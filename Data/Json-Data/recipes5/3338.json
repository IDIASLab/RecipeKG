I used 1 can of regular diced tomatoes and 1 can of Rotel tomatoes (the ones with green chiles).  I use lime instead of lemon because that just makes more sense.  I use an entire onion, again my taste. 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic.  No hot sauce because that's just weird in salsa, and I use 1 or 2 serano peppers instead of jalapenos because I think it's a better tasting pepper.  I mix this up in a food processor and let sit overnight.  It's the only salsa I make now.",

The flavor is so delicious and my husband who is NOT a salsa eater, ate a large bowl of this salsa with chips tonight. I could not believe it. I made this recipe as written and was very impressed and satisfied. The ingredients and instructions are simple and it is restaurant quality. I served this with a mexican themed dinner tonight and it was a huge success. My family (except for my husband, until now) enjoys eating salsa and chips for a snack. I have purchased about every brand of jarred salsa but they just don't taste like the salsa at a mexican restaurant. I'm going to keep this as a staple in the fridge and never buy jarred salsa again. Great recipe and thank you for sharing.",

It is made with canned tomatoes but the cilantro & onion gives it a nice freshness. I also used a hand emulsion blender which made it real quick to make. The only downside is it is a little bit too hot for my taste. I added a pinch of garlic powder and of onion salt but left out the hot sauce as the green chiles in tomatoes and fresh jalepeno was enough hotness for me. Also it makes a lot of salsa. So unless your having a party I would maybe cut the recipe in half.",
