I used half shortening and half butter for the crust and it was very flakey. I was worried after reading the reviews that the pie filling wouldn't set properly so I baked it for an hour (not including the pre-bake) at 325. It turned out beautifully and the filling was perfectly set. I definitely recommend that you should try this pie. Your family will thank you!",

I made 2 for my family and one for my bestfriend. Everyone loved it. My besfriend called the day after and said she had it for brekfast. I like it a bit less chilled so I took it out as we sat down for dinner. I will make many more of these pies over the holiday..",
