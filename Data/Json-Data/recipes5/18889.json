Using cranberries, walnuts, and golden raisins, you can make a stuffing that sweetens your Thanksgiving meal! I'm not actually sure how well it does when baked in a turkey. I find that putting stuffing in the bird tends to dry the bird.",

If you like your stuffing to really stick together than you need to double the butter sauce and bake it in a smaller baking dish. I personally like my stuffing broken apart it gives it a lighter flavor. Thanks for posting!!",
