After reading several reviews I made the following changes: used red potatoes skin on slice about 1/8\" thick. Increased cook time by 5 minutes (10 each side 5 to melt the cheese). Used a foil pan covered with a piece of foil sprayed both the pan and the inside of the foil cover -- EASY CLEANUP!! Omitted the white onion. In the foil pan just placed the potatoes garlic and a few pats of butter. Crisped up several slices of bacon & chopped some green onion. In the last five minutes of cook time peeled back the foil tossed in the cheese and bacon. After 5 minutes removed from grill sprinkled with the chopped green onion and served with side of sour cream. Talk about melt in your mouth! Mmmmm. My new man was very impressed and loved these potatoes! Will make again and again and again!! Side note: these also made great breakfast potatoes the next day -- just heat & serve!",

I made the assembling easier by melting the butter and mixing in the minced garlic. I poured this over the potatoes and sprinkled them with dried parsley. They did take all of 20 minutes to cook and some of the potatoes and onions stuck to the packet. I recommend spraying the inside of the foil with pam before adding the ingredients. You could even mix everything together in a large bowl and then pour it into your foil packet. That way the butter would be distributed evenly. Instead of cheddar I sprinkled a little parmesan over the top. These did have good flavor and were fun to make along with our steaks but these just didn't knock our socks off. Glad I gave these a try. Thanks Kelly",
