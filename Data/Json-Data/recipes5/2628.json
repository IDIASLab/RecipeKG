The eggplant becomes tender in the oven and absorbs the flavors of tomato, onion, and bell pepper for a wonderful Middle Eastern dish. I made this dish for Thanksgiving; it was a big hit with my Armenian grandmother! Serve with sides of tabuli salad, hummus, and a whole wheat pita. I hope you enjoy this taste of Armenia from my family to yours!",

I used canned petite diced tomatoes instead of the tomatoes and instead of the sauce, and I sprinkled a bit of garlic, oregano, basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes on top before the final bake because sauce usually has spices, while the diced tomatoes do not. It was very tasty, and I will definitely make it again. I served it as the main course with brown rice and quinoa on the side. I think it would taste great with some grated Parmesan or other cheese melted on top.",

The only thing I did differently was to use the entire 15-oz. can of tomato sauce (I didn t have a smaller can and didn t want to waste any).

Your site offers recipes from around the world -- don't you think it's time to recognize that your audience is also from around the world?  \n\nNot to beat the horse, but the eggplant I buy is about 60 to 100 grams each.  I have no idea how large is large in this recipe. \n\nI'll do my best with what I have and post photos and gram weight for the ingredents.  Thanks so much for your understanding.",
