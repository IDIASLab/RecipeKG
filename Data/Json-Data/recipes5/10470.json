Last time I made it was Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The fact that it's cold kind of throws you but it's absolutely delicious. I have a 30 minute drive to the in-laws so I'm always looking for recipes that I don't have to reheat or that I can stick in a crock pot. This dip is perfect because I can make it ahead the night before,  refrigerate overnight while the flavors meld, then get to the party, pull the saran wrap off, throw Triscuits on a plate and voila! My 11 year old son (who hates vegetables and clams) helped me make it last night. While he stirred the vegetables on the stove top, he said \"this smells amazing!\" When he tried the finished product, he said \"this is the best thing I have ever tasted, and I don't just mean that because I helped!\" Thanks Chef John!!!",
