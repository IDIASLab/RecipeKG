My suggestion to make it a touch less messy is I spread the cream cheese mixture on the bottom of a decorative pan and then put the cocktail sauce on top. It makes it easier for guests to spread and doesnt ruin your \"Creation\" like when you put it in the ball form. Wonderful recipe good one to share.",

It's the day before Thanksgiving and I'm making all those last minute things. One thing that has always been on our table every Thanksgiving has been celery stuffed with cream cheese. Now that \"I've\" been the one cooking the holiday dinners the past few years I'm final able to spice things up a bit hahaha. I substituted a 6oz can of fancy lump crabmeat for the shrimp added 2 TBSP of fresh chopped parsley and added a tsp of Emeril Lagasse's essence spice (you don't have to buy it I got the recipe last year when I made his cranberry glazed Turkey breast). I used all the other ingredients such as the lemon juice and hot sauce. I think it tastes fantastic. Not sure if anyone else will like it tomorrow or not but I do haha.
