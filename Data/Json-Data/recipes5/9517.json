I followed this recipe, for the most part,with the exception of increasing the eggs to 6 and adding another 1/2 cup of milk. I used a combination of 1 lb sage Jimmy Dean Sausage and 4 slices crumbled bacon. I also added a light sprinkling of Garlic salt along with the 1/4 tsp. salt and I used 2 cups of mild cheddar and some left over colby/cheddar mix. I did toss the cheese in 1 TBS flour.I used a large 9x12 commercial pan and used the \"No Roll Pie Crust II\" from this site, doubling the dough to fit the pan. This was the first item sold out at the coffee shop and I only made one pan. I have made this Quiche as stated with outstanding results. This is also a good recipe to add your own goodies and flair! I prepared it the night before, pre-baked the pie crust at 450 for 8 minutes, poured in the mixture and then refrigerated until morning. With the oven at 350 I baked it for 35 minutes then I topped off with more cheese and crumbled bacon for 5 minutes. It was perfect! Try different cheeses and do not be afraid to experiment. This recipe is foolproof.",

I upped the temperature to 375, as other people had suggested, and it cooked in about 45 minutes. It was great! Everybody loved it. I would recommend putting the pie plate on a cookie sheet when you put it in the oven so if it overflows a little the mess is easier to clean up.",

I cooked the bacon first and then set aside the bacon grease; used some of it to cook the onions and then the spinach and mushroom as well- that really adds a great flavor to it! i took it to a baby shower and it got rave reviews!
