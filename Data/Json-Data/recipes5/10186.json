I started out making it exactly as written and found myself needing to add lots more broth- about 2 cups- just to even cover the noodles. My dutch oven isn't huge, either, I used my 5 qt. Next time I'll probably add another 2 on top of that. So in adding broth to cook the noodles, you'll want to bump up the seasonings a bit as well. I don't know who needs a full rotisserie chicken, but that is a whole lot of chicken. I stopped at about 2 big handfuls and that was good. The flavor was pretty good, too, it just felt like it was missing a little bit of smack. That may have been from trying to compensate from adding broth, though. Overall, a great way for us to use up veggies and chicken that needed using up. Especially since we have colds.",
