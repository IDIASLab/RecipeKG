Next time I will double the sauce ingredients because it is so yummy - the sweetness of the sauce went really well with my tangy mashed potatoes (I use hardly any butter and lots of lite sour cream). I did change the recipe a little bit: instead of flouring the bag I put the flour on a plate and put a little of the measured ginger in the flour before putting the rest in the applesauce. I dredged the roast in the seasoned flour and browned the roast on the stove. I stirred the remaining ginger/flour into the applesauce (you could end up with a dry floury lump if you don't stir) and proceeded normally from there. One of our new favorites. Thanks for the great recipe!",
