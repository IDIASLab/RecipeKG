I added some almond essence to the batter as well as a little cinnamon allspice ginger and nutmeg. I brushed the warm cake with about 2 tablespoons of Disaronno liquer before using the apricot jam. Make sure you keep the cake a good way down from the heat while browning the the top as it can burn very quickly.",

I was so happy to find a recipe that was easy to follow and that I didn't have to translate from metric.  :) Everything went very well until the very last instruction.  I put the marzipan on top of the warmed apricot jam, brushed on the egg as instructed (I did not make the round balls - just kept the flat part) and put it in the MIDDLE of the oven (not even the top rack).  I put the timer on for 8 min (instruction was 8-10 min) and decided to look at it at the 3 min mark.  The entire top of the cake was black and burnt to a crisp!! It looked and smelled like a marshmallow that has become cinderized at the campfire.  The good news is that I was able to scrape off the marzipan and just eat the cake \"as is\".  My husband really enjoyed it.  I love this recipe and will probably make it again, but I'm not sure how to edit that last bit.  I would have given 4.5* but was unable to.",
