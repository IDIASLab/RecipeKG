I added 1 TSP of Vanilla and subbed nutmeg for cinnamon. Oh one more thing... I used half a jar of jam for each batch.",

It added a really good flavor, reduced the fat, and I think helped the improve the crumbly factor other reviewers have mentioned--they stuck together just fine.  However, one reviewer said she left out the sugar entirely and put tons of jam so I tried to just put half the sugar and tons of jam.  It was okay but next time I'm just gonna put the sugar.  Half the sugar = breakfast snack (not a problem), but all the sugar = treat (yum!).",

I don't know why but as I was making it - I just didn't have high expectations. I figured most of it would go to waste since my husband isn't a big oatmeal fan. I was pleasantly surprised! My husband and I both LOVED it. After he took his first bite - he asked me to make it again - so we wouldn't run out. His only complaint is that we didn't have any vanilla ice cream to go with it. (He stopped at the store the very next day to get some). We've been reheating the bars in the microwave and then serving it with ice cream all week. My only complaint is that I've gained 10 pounds...",
