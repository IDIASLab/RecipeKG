I was too lazy to drag out the blender, lol, so (earlier in the day) I grated the cucumber and squeezed it dry, then just mixed it in a bowl w/ the rest of the ingredients and refrigerated it to allow the flavors to blend. I marinated my chicken for about 4 hours, only using about 2 tsps. of the oregano b/c I didn't want it to be too overpowering, and that was perfect for us. I cooked the chicken in a pan w/ evoo on the stove instead of broiling it and that worked great. Hubby made several comments on how good these were (and I agree), so that makes this a keeper for us~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I Tried this and it was just as good as Greek meatballs but cheaper and easier. I like Tzatziki II from this site, although I have realized I like sourcream more than yogurt and it is cheaper. I also just squize the water out of the cucumber using a paper towel but dont mess with getting the water out of the yogurt or sourcream and  I like \"real Hummus\" from this site. I cant remember where I found my recipe for keftethes but it is a mixture of a pound of lamb, 1/2 pound ground beef, mint, bread crumbs, egg, and garlic. and then I lightly fry them in a pan. I tried googling but all recipes add something I do not use. As for the chicken I used the marinade but did not broil. I used a frying pan and put in alittle oil on medium high (my oven goes from 1-8 and High I was on 8) when the pan is hot i dump in the chicken I then let it brown on each sides and cook. it getting brown is what creates the flavor. Sometimes when I dont have time to make pita bread i will buy flat bread and heat it in a pan for 15 to 20 seconds a side with alittle oil. and for added flavor I like to grill red onions in a pan with alittle butter or oil. and Don't forget to top with Feta!",

I would definitely try it again though and experiment more with different spices.",

I marinated the chicken strips for about 4 hours and cooked on the grill in a basket rather than broil.  I made the sauce as stated, but the next time I will NOT use the blender.  It made the sauce way too thin.  Next time I will just blend by hand.  We have a favorite Greek restaurant close to home, so I purchased homemade pitas to use with this recipe.  I served this with 'Onion Pasta' from AR and we enjoyed a terrific dinner.  My family LOVED this week's selection.  Thanks KarenCanCook for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper!",
