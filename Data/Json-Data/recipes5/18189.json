I didn't really think it belonged there and I love garlic. Next time i will hold back on a little of the brown sugar and not add any garlic. Also I used cider vinegar and it worked just fine. Thanks for the recipe. The 4 stars is based on the sweetness. Not my mistake of adding garlic. UPDATE: Made this again with a little less sugar and they were perfect for our tastes.",

Here in amish country we must grow things big because the beets took closer to 30 min to cook. I didn't have malt vinegar but read other reviews and decided to try with cider vinegar- when I reached for the bottle realized there was only about 1Tbsp in it and resorted to white and cut back to 4Tbsp of the vinegar- I tasted the sauce/juice and it was still on the sour side so just added an extra Tbsp of brwn. sugar. Rated 5 stars because I'm sure if I had the apple cider or malt vinegar that the sour and sweet would balance! Good recipe despite my purple fingers!!!",
