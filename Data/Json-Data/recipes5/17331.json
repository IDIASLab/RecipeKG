Just like the majority of recipes I try I just have to add a little extra something. I decreased the soy to 1/4 of a cup (some reviewers said 1/2 a cup made it too salty) and added a dash of onion powder garlic powder and worchestershire sauce. The chops turned out tasty and tender. At first the sauce didn't look like it would be enough but the pork lets out a lot of water so no problem there. I'm serving this with egg noodles and baked cauliflower (also found on this site). Hubby's not home from work yet (and my 4 year old son wouldn't touch pork chops with a ten foot stick) so I'm basing this review upon my little \"taste test\" and I enjoyed it. Thanks Lynda.",

I used low sodium soy sauce, added a couple splashes of rice wine vinegar and let it go. I found that this was done in 4 hours vs. 6 and there's nothing worse than the dreaded \"dry pork\" so watch your cooking time. I plated it and to pretty it up a bit I topped it with some chopped green onion - very good without a lot of effort.",

I gave this recipe five stars because my preschooler not only ate his whole chop but had two helpings of rice with the \"gravy\" on it. He hummed while he ate. I wasn't sure what Chinese ketchup was so I used half hoisin sauce and half ketchup. I also used about half the amount of light soy and almost doubled the sugar and it was still plenty salty enough. During the last hour or so I added some canned pineapple chunks along with a good shot of the juice and half a green pepper. Definitely a keeper! Thank you.",
