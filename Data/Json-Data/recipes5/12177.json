I used the high setting on my crockpot, and ran just slightly over 5 hours.All the ingredients were already in my frig and pantry, including  part of a ham, and all that was required was opening a few cans and cutting up potatoes and ham. The recipe would easily accommodate additional veggies, but the soup turned out delicious as written. The cream cheese added just the right amount of creaminess, without turning it into a thick gloppy soup. It was easy to prepare and satisfying on our cold, snowy day. I'm about to have some for breakfast!",

Also way too much chicken fat between the broth and the cream of chicken soup. My intestines were greased like a ball bearing for 3 days. A better option would be to use that good old fashioned stuff called water in place of most of the chicken broth. We use so much broth in soups nowadays where water used to be used. It would lower the sodium content as well. If you have to watch your sodium and or have IBS or a sensitive stomach, this recipe is not for you, tasty as it is.",
