I'll start by saying that the turkey tasted great but I didn't really taste the flavors from the brine and the ingredients are too expensive to waste on something I'm not tasting. I've used other brines before and I don't feel the other ingredients added anything special. The cranberry juice dyed the bird an unappetizing pink and it browned way too quickly. I covered with foil but the skin was almost black by the time it was done. So in the future I think I'll pass on the frozen juices but use other features from this recipe.",

I then strained it and used the thin liquid to inject in the bird. I also kept the solid and used that as a rub for the outside. There were a lot of compliments on the flavor and moisture.
