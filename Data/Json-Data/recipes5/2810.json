I wasn't able to get the same results grinding more almonds at once; the pieces were still too large.  I rolled the dough out between two sheets of parchment so I didn't have any \"sticky issues\" there either.  However, I think the bake time listed in the recipe is way, way, way too long.  I baked my first two batches at 325F for 12 minutes (half the recommended time!) and they ended up misshapen on the bottom...  It was almost like the middles exploded and oozed out.  I reduced the baking time to 8 minutes for my last dozen, and they were perfect.  (\"Perfect\" to me is completely cooked through but tender, with a light brown cookie and still-white glaze.)",

I was a little nervous to make them after reading several comments about how sticky and hard to work with the dough is. I however did NOT have this problem at all. I used ground almond from the bulk barn and didn't have any lemon zest so I just skipped that part. I added 1/4 tsp of cloves and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I whipped my egg whites (2 large eggs worth) nice and fluffy for several minutes in my mixer. I added the sugar gradually and it made this very gooey marshmallow type of stuff. I folded it into the almond/spice mixture and it was pretty crumbly looking. I popped it into the fridge while I waited for the oven and prepped my pans. (max 5 minutes). I found the dough easy to work with if you knead it with your hands first. I rolled it between two sheets of parchment and cut out my stars (2 sizes). The meringue glaze is very thick but easy to paint on with a pastry brush. The cookies baked for 9-11 minutes until the glaze JUST started to brown on the points of the stars. They sat on the pans for a minute or two then went onto my cooling racks. When warm they're crispy on the outside and wonderfully chewy on the inside. I hope they stay this delicious even after they cool. FANTASTIC recipe - thank you.",

I used a smaller star cut-out and probably baked them too long as they are very crunchy - hopefully they're a little chewier when you don't overcook them! They rolled out beautifully and taste great although I would probably reduce the cinnamon just a little bit and I usually like lots. My one complaint is the glaze which browned in the oven and isn't pretty at all. Is the recipe accurate in saying you put the glaze on BEFORE baking? Next time I'll leave it off.",
