I didn't think I could get him away from his customary burrito's but he told me that these were the best muffins he's ever had. He said \"you offered me butter but they don't need butter they are so good and moist best muffin I've ever had\" I will add a little more butter to the bottom of the pan as the nuts stuck a little but i'll be making these on a regular basis. They are awesome! Thanks for sharing this great recipe. They are chalk full of good things and completely satisfying.",
