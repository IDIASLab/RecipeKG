You can customize it to your taste by cutting back on the pepper and hot sauce;  I like about half the pepper and hot sauce.  Enjoy this wonderful mix!  It is so easy and much cheaper than buying pre-made mix.",

This  mix has just the right amount of heat to it -- not too much heat in the front on the tongue, but enough heat at the back to give it some heat and a kick.  The flavor, overall, is very balanced.  \n\nWe used Campbell's low-sodium tomato juice.  I made this and let the mix meld in the fridge for about two hours before I mixed it with a shot and a half of vodka.  I'm very impressed with this and will certainly make this again.\n\nThanks for posting the recipe!",
