My husband's words were \"I would never in a million years ever order or make this but wow! very good!I'd eat it again.\" Some substitutes we did were as follows: 1. We used cilantro instead of parsley. 2. Did NOT add honey to salsa or Jalapenos. 3. added a dash of salt to the mango salsa 4. chose not to drizzle taco sauce onto final product. 5. I am not a big measurer so I added one whole avacado and didn't really measure the seasonings. As you can see not huge modifications but changed to our tastes. This is definitely a keeper and a make again for sure! Thank you for an awesome dinner!",
