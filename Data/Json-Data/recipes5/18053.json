Also, cut the fat off the one side before cooking or the flavor won't get in the meat as much and it'll be a bit on the fatty/greasy side.\n\nNext time I may be brave and try one can water, one can Guiness since it seems expensive to use two cans.\n\nDon't forget the brown sugar (light/golden worked fine for me) and the seasoning packet - it all goes in there!",

Last year I cooked it in a big pot and added the veggies the last hour-- my husband and his friends were making fun of me the entire week beforehand because they thought I would \"ruin\" St. Patty's Day by going out on a limb... boy, were they shocked when it turned out so good that they're actually REQUESTING it this year!... my husband has been looking forward to today for the last month! This year, I plan to use my new crock pot since it's been my experience that meat gets even more amazingly melt-in-your-mouth the longer you cook it... Give this one a try!\n\n(I've never written a review before, but this recipe is so good, I felt compelled to spread the good news and dispel any doubts others have had!)",

Paddy's day for a true Irish family(my husbands) and they loved it ( I also did the boiled corn beef just incase). His father (from Ireland) said it was the best corn beef he ever had and he truely enjoyed it. I even loved it and I am not a big fan of corn beef. The beer is not strong and the brown sugar is just perfect. My husband wants me to cook it this way all the time. Thanks so much for the recipe. Will make again and again and again. I did boil the cabbage and potatoes in a different pot since I didnt have room for them. The carrots I did with the meat and wow. I recommend everyone to try it this way.",

I made it with a 2.5lb flat cut corned beef brisket and used 1 can of Murphys instead of Guinness, cooked in a slow cooker for 6hrs. (Note: Murphys is similar to Guinness but not as bitter and strong as Guinness, it\u2019s the Irish stout that I prefer. If you don\u2019t like Guinnes try this recipe with Murphys!) I rinsed the beef under water (too bloody!), trimmed fat off and coated with 2tbsp of brown sugar then placed it in the slow cooker. Poured the stout into a bowl, then I added the spice pack came with the corned beef PLUS additional spice (peppercorns, allspice, cloves, thyme...etc) to the stout than poured the mixture into the slow cooker. At 2.5 hrs before eating, I put on \"High\" and added 6 halved red potatoes, 4 chopped carrots and 1 chopped onion. I added the 1 cabbages, cut into wedges, 1 hr before eating. This came out just perfect, the house smelled wonderful while it's cooking! The beef were so tender, all the vegetables were a bit over cooked so I'll put them in for shorter time next time or just cook them on low(?). I also made the \"amazing Irish soda bread\" from this site. Highly recommended!! Please give this a try!",

This is purely a function of how long you cook it; cook it longer, and it gets more tender.  Here's what we did... we didn't bother putting the corned beef on a roasting rack.  Instead, we put the corned beef, sugar, and guinness in a dutch oven (yes, the meat was sitting right in the beer).  We put it (covered) in a 300 degree oven, and then every 45 minutes we turned the meat over.  After two hours, we added cabbage and potatoes, and then let it go for another 1.5 hours.  When we were done, the meat was a little tough, so we cooked it for another 45-60 minutes.  When we were done, we had the best corned beef we've ever had.  Usually we smother our corned beef with mustard and our potatoes with ketchup, but we needed neither with this delicious (and ridiculously easy) recipe.  It's slightly sweet, but really nicely flavored.  Enjoy!",

                "reviewBody": "I opted for the slow cooker since it seamed fool-proof and should have been very tender. But no. Started the cooker at 7am St. Patty's Day. 11 hours later I stuck a fork to it. Brick. Fork wouldn't even penetrate it. Same after 14 hours. Ended up cooking this center-cut beef all night and pulled the plug after 21 hours with slight increase in tenderness but it sure smelled great! Had it for dinner the next night and everyone loved it even though it was still very firm. Next time I'll use a more conventional recipe from Allrecipes and just drink the beer on the side :) UPDATE: I believe my problem was in using Guiness EXTRA Stout. This, as I found out later, has a much higher alcohol content than regular draft. Almost 4 times as much. Too much booze would certainly toughen the roast.",
