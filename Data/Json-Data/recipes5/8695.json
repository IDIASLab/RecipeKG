Like the other review said, it was a bit liquid when I opened the lid, but I stirred occasionally for about 10 minutes and it soaked the rest in and it was perfect. That\u2019s when I added the butter, corn and parmesan. I loved the sweet corn in it. I\u2019ll try it with other veggies, too. Maybe mushrooms or peas. I used white grape juice instead of wine with a splash of white wine vinegar. It still felt like it had wine in it. It\u2019ll make a great side dish for the family in the future.",

It is such a time saver to make using the Instant Pot. My ears of corn were on the small side and I probably should have used at least an extra ear or two (maybe 2-3 cups fresh corn kernels total) but the end result was still amazing! So good that my husband declared he would gladly take extra to work for lunch today. My only reason for rating 4 stars is that it seemed like I had a little too much liquid even after stirring everything together. I just let it sit a bit on keep warm and stirred every so often and the rice seemed to absorb the liquid. Next time I will reduce the amount of broth to use by 1/2 - 1 cup (3 - 3.5 cups broth total perhaps). Thanks for the recipe! I can't wait to make risotto again in the Instant Pot!",
