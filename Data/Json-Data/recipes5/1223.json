I use Ritz crackers, but that's just personal preference -- I like Ritz's buttery taste!  And, NO NEED TO FRY the chops before baking!!  (No more grease splatters/no wasted time/not another dirty dish!)  Just dip/batter & place chops in a rectangular glass baking dish (sprayed with Pam) ~ AND top with thin pats of butter!! (Don't scrimp on the butter -- use 1/2 a stick for both sides of 6 chops!)  Bake at 400 for 15 minutes.  Flip chops over & top with more pats of butter.  Bake 10 minutes longer & Voila!  Crispy-coated, moist delicious!   Couldn't be easier!  Delish!",

I let the chops soak in the egg (added the seasonings to egg; suggest oregano and garlic salt) for about 15-30 minutes then bread in crushed saltines.  Other readers have suggested Ritz but I feel it hides the taste.  After breading let the chops rest on wax paper so the breading hardens.  This keeps the breading on the chops during frying. \n\nI know that rating this recipe then saying I changed it really doesn't count but the concept is a keeper and I just wanted to add another thought to the same concept. This has always been a winner in my family.",

Fry in hot oil till browned on one side flip and do the same. If chops are real thick transfer to cookie sheet and finish in oven for 20-30 minutes. Oh and this works equally well on chicken.
