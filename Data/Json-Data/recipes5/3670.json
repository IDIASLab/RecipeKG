                "reviewBody": "I really liked this recipe! I changed the quantities to 6 servings and used 5 zucchinis. To have enough lamb I had to use 50% more lamb (On top of changing the servings to 6). I ground my own lamb from fresh lamb shoulder. Gutting the Zucchini is difficult - use a long thin knife and careful not to break the skin! I added the guts of the zucchini to the sauce which added some needed texture and this way I did not waste any food. Next time I will use 30% less mint. It was a little too minty for me but maybe ok for other people. Also I simmered it for 30 minutes after adding garlic rather than 15. I'm glad I did that. Make sure you choose zucchinis that are as fat as possible! It's not a super easy recipe but it looks elegant and exotic when served with the sauce on the top. I served it with potatoes fried in olive oil and chopped spinach with savory salt pepper and oregano. Went together very well!! Good meal to impress guests with!!",
