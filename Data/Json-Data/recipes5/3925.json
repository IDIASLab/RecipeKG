                "reviewBody": "Many of the four or five star ratings for this recipe are only after the reviewer made significant changes. A perfect recipe should be spot on accurate and not need doctoring with amounts of ingredients the ingredients themselves pan sizes or baking times. While I agree with a lot of the changes made they are no longer reviewing THIS recipe. As this recipe stands it is first too short on filling for this size pan. Most lemon bar recipes however do call for a two egg filling for an 8x8 pan or a four egg filling for a 9x13 pan. This recipe also calls for powdered sugar in the filling which I've never seen. I don't think it would be enough given the amount of lemon juice called for. So as written I believe this recipe has some problems and only merits three stars. I made this in a 9x9 pan although an 11x7 is fine too. I made the crust as written but made a couple of changes on the filling. I made 1-1/2 times the filling recipe and used regular granulated sugar instead of the confectioners' sugar called for. I baked the crust 15 minutes at 350 degrees and then another 15-20 minutes once the filling was added. The tartness and sweetness were just right and there was a better balance of crust to filling. I did observe however that I much prefer lemon bar recipes that call for a little flour in the filling as opposed to baking powder. All and all a nice altered version of this recipe but I'd much prefer a recipe that required no revision.",
