Turned out OK but nothing exceptional. At the same time a good addition to our regular wintertime rotation of rice and bread puddings. I added vanilla. And a whipped cream topping (CoolWhip would be good too). My family enjoyed it. Will make again.",

I scaled it down to four servings, followed the recipe to the letter, and the thing that we disliked the most  was the dominating molasses flavor.  Secondly, we all eat with our eyes, this has zero eye appeal, and we didn\u2019t even like the texture of it  The two of us each had a serving with a drizzle of Plum Pudding Sauce (also on this site), which made it at least edible, and then I threw the rest of it away.  Sorry, but this one was a bust for us, and I won\u2019t be making again.",
