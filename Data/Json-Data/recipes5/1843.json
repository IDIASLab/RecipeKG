Marinated in soy sauce, sake, and mirin, the chicken is grilled to sweet, smoky perfection and dipped in a refreshing, herby miso 'ranch' sauce that'll send your summer cookout guests into a frenzy. The only bottles not invited to this party are bottled teriyaki sauces! Garnish with sesame seeds if desired.",

I also made this marinade for the chicken and used it on Salmon with great success.\n\nA couple points from the trenches: (1) hold back some of the chicken marinade for later basting the chicken skewers (doing so avoids having to cook out the raw chicken juices in the used marinade); (2) the scratch-built Miso Ranch dressing was soooo amazing that I don't think you will be able to look commercially made 'Ranch\" dressing in the eye, so prepare yourself to throw out that half-used bottle of ranch dressing sitting in your frig; (3) I didn't include the 'green onion' in the ranch dressing (I just forgot to add it), but the ranch dressing was amazing; (4) I put the chicken pieces and marinade in a large ziplock bag to marinate - sooooo much easier than combining in a bowl (perhaps not as environmental-friendly, but don't tell my daughter!)....\n\nGood eating.",

We cooked the chicken over a camp fire, and it was a big hit.\n\nI decided to make this recipe because I had chicken thighs, and we were heading to a camp cookout.  I made a few alterations due to not having ingredients readily available.\n\nFirst is that I replaced the murin & sake with equal amounts of balsamic vinegar.  This provided a similar function, by adding a tang and adding to the overall flavor profile.\n\nI  also skipped the miso ranch, because I didn\u2019t have many of those ingredients.  Instead I made an extra batch of the marinade, cooked it down in a sauce pan, and added cornstarch until very thick.  I basted the chicken with this glaze, and used it as a dip.\n\nYum...enjoy!",
