It would be just as good without. Also added salt and pepper at the table. This dish is versatile too. My Dad eats meat and I don't so I just added his precooked chicken to the dish after taking my portion out. Five full stars for this delicious dish that I will most definitely make again especially as the weather gets warmer and the veggies are even fresher! Thanks so much for posting this Ebwallace!",

The first time I made this it was good but not quite enough sauce. The second time I upped the sauce and basil. After serving I topped it with crumbled feta cheese. SO GOOD! Even my husband who is picky with cheeses thought it took it up a notch. Even though I changed a few things this recipe is so versatile I don't think it hurt it at all. It became a favorite for everybody after the first time. The next time I make this I am going to add some fresh baby spinach to the pasta just enough to wilt it. I think some other great veggies to try would be peppers zuchinni mushrooms etc. A on this one!!",
