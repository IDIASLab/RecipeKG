Because some had said the brownies weren't chewy enough I added 1 tbsp cooking oil with the butter. Others had said it was too floury-tasting so I decreased the flour to 2/3 cup. And I decreased the baking powder to 3/4 tsp. Also I baked them til they were just brown around the edges about 23 minutes. And --- TA-DA! I ended up with moist chewy brownies. I halved the frosting recipe and it was just the right amount; not overly thick or sweet. What a pleasant change from chocolate brownies with a lighter and more delicate flavor. We loved them with the recipe changes I made.",

I did however add a few things....toasted chopped walnuts and pecans as well as butterscotch chips. About 1/4 C of each ingredient. You don't want to add too many butterscotch chips since that would make the brownies even sweeter then they already are. I also believe that adding the icing is a mistake. All I did was wait until the brownies cooled and sprinkled them with powdered sugar. That was perfect. Also I used an 8x8 pan and cut the brownies 5 down and 5 across making a total of 25 pcs. Since the brownies are so rich a small piece is all you need to satisfy your sweet tooth. THESE BROWNIES HAVE A WONDERFUL RICH BUTTERSCOTCH FLAVOR. Absolutely will make again! Oh yeah they did settle just a tiny bit in the middle but most brownies will do that. Try them you'll like them...for sure!!!!",
