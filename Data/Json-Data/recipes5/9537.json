I added a little more mayonnaise (which I really didn't want to do because I was adding fat) and it thickened a little. At least in my mind the problem is the name of this recipe because it's too runny to use as a spread or even a dip. It should be \"Roasted Red Pepper Sauce\" not \"...Spread.\" On the other hand what I ended up with is a nicely-flavored sauce. If I were to make this again using roasted peppers in a jar I'd blot the peppers with paper towels or use a salad spinner to remove as much water as possible. If you roast your own peppers you may not have this problem. In spite of the consistency issue it does taste yummy.",

But the reviews I got for the dip were raving. I used a mix of red and orange mini bell peppers and over roasted them then blended it all together. Definitely will make again most likely with a few tweaks here and there since I am incapable of following a recipe exactly.",
