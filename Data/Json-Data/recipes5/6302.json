I was looking for a quick dip recipe for Christmas day and had limited amounts of mayo and sour cream on hand so this recipe came to my rescue. I used marinated artichokes as that was all I had on hand and it turned out great. The parmesan cheese comes through strongly so if you aren't a cheese fan this wouldn't be for you. Family members scraped the bowl on this dip!",
