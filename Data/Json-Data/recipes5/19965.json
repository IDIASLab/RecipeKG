I used the bread I had on hand which happened to be Udi's gluten-free sandwich slices. I tore slices to pieces and firmed them up a bit in the oven. Other than that I followed the directions as is except added a few raisins in with the bread chunks and baking in a ramekin (made a single serving). As I suspected the texture was not a hit with me-I loved the top layer but below it was too soft for my liking. BUT the flavors and overall taste was very yum! Since the issue was a personal preference I will adapt this recipe next time I make French toast on the stove top because I really like the combo. Thanks for the inspiration!",

My family didn't like it as well as I did probably because they aren't used to the taste of the cardamom. I think the next time I would make it I'd only use half the cardamom just to win them over. The egg/milk mixture didn't quite soak up all the bread so there was a variety of bread textures in the casserole. Thanks for the recipe!",
