I think cayenne are my favourite peppers so I admit, having followed the recipe to the letter, I ended up adding some more cayenne on top, but as is this is a five-star recipe. I added an extra Tbsp of olive oil because it seemed a bit dry but this is our preference. Also, next time, I will add a fresh cayenne in with the mix. Thank you for the recipe.",

I even made the tahini paste from scratch (recipe in AllRecipes). He absolutely LOVED it (I don't do the spicy stuff) and ate a whole weeks worth in one day that by the time I got home he already ate it. So I took a photo of the remnants.:-) he stated it has a better texture as in its not smooth like the store kind and tastes more fresh than the store bought. I will definitely be making this again.",

However I got a little tip for the preperation that makes it much tastier: Instead of pouring the tahini with the rest of the ingredient and mixing it seperatley in a food processor\\blender it is better to mix it in a bowl (as if you're making actual tahini) tasting the mixture making sure it's ok and then pour it into the food processor. Thumbs up on the recipe though. Incredibly delicious.",
