I started by warming the milk and applesauce (it is what I had so I used it) together in a measuring cup on high for about 1-2 minutes in the microwave or until the mixture reached 115 degrees. Then I added the yeast directly to this and let it rest for a few minutes. I then added 1/2 C. of all-purpose flour and 1/2 C. whole wheat flour the oats sugar oil(instead of the shortening) and 3 T powdered gluten and mixed on medium for 2 minutes to a thick batter. I then added the salt and another 1 C. of whole wheat flour and mixed for one more minute. Then I changed to the dough hook added the rest of the flour until kneaded about halfway then finished kneading by hand. I let rise for one hour punched down then put it in my greased bread pan and rose for about 40 minutes more (until about an inch above pan) and then baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Yummy soft and great texture great for sandwiches!!! I will use this one again! This is a good recipe even if you don't own a bread machine!",

But using the ingredients stipulated and \"working\" the loaves in the same way I've always done (punching it down twice letting it rest between \"punches\" and then kneading the hey out of it) I got 2 very nice sized very tasty loaves out of the recipe. Oh yeah I used \"Old Fashioned\" Oats rather than \"Quick Cooking\" and we all enjoyed the little bit more CRUNCH that afforded.",

I don't have a bread machine so I made this the old fashioned way. Used 1.5 cups graham flour 1.5 cups bread flour and regular rolled oats. After I placed it in a greased bowl to rise I covered it and put it in the fridge overnight. Then in the morning I punched it down shaped it into a loaf put in a greased loaf pan and let rise another hour. Then baked at 350 for 30 minutes. The overnight rise was great - it made the oats dissolve into the bread and it's not 'chunky' if you know what I mean.",
