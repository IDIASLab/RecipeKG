I came home and tried to recreate the awesome flavor and have been making it ever since. Think of this as a guideline rather than a recipe. The amount of anchovies, garlic, and red pepper flakes are all really up to you. I like to serve this in a bowl with a big piece of corn bread on top. Enjoy!",
