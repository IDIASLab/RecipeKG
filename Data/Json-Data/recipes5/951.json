I did do what a few others suggested... I added broccoli about 1/2 tsp of celery salt 1/2 tsp of onion powder and I doubled the garlic and it tasted really good. The kids picked at it but they are picky eaters.. all the adults who ate it really enjoyed it w/ a good side salad.This is definatly a keeper for all those leftovers after Easter!! UPDATE I've made this a few times now and I have since added those fried french onions to the top.. the onions give it a great taste and the crunch is EXACTLY what this recipe needs! This is a favorite at my house now and I've made this even when I didn't have Easter leftovers!",

I topped it with a few dry bread crumbs for crunch and a little cheddar cheese during baking and watched my husband go at it. I have a request to do this again. Easy and good.",

INstead of making the potatoes from the recipe I just threw in some leftover mashed taters and stopped adding when i liked the consistency. Based on reviews i chopped up some frozen broccoli and threw it in there. Also since this is a recipe designed to use up leftovers i threw in some leftover mixed vegetables from the fridge.I also used cream of chicken soup. Delicous!! Will definately make everytime we have ham. My husband even asked me to wrap the leftovers from this dish for lunch the next day!!",
