I followed the suggestion to use cherry juice instead of water in the icing.  I love the pretty pink color and extra cherry flavor.  I also used almond extract instead of vanilla.  I always add almond extract to a cherry pie and thought it would enhance the flavor here as well - and it did.  I doubled the recipe, used a 9 x 13 pan and it came out just fine. I didn't double the icing as I thought a glaze was all that was needed on these rich and deicious bars.  Thanks for a new holiday favorite, Karen!!!",
