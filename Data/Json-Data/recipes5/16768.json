I used a boxed brownie mix in a 13x9 pan, added the butterscotch chips and marshmallows to the prepared mix, spread in the pan and baked for about 30 minutes.  The marshmallows did \"rise\" to the top of the pan, but it looks so pretty and tastes wonderful!  The marshmallows got nice and soft and gooey and the chips make a great addition to the boxed mix.  Thanks for the idea!",

If you let these \"brownies\" (more like a cookie/candie bar) sit over night in the pan (with lid to keep them fresh) they turn out to be awesome! Thanks a lot, like Im not heavy enough as is. XD",

Growing up my best friends mother made these (with 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips though)and I've loved them ever since. I now make these for my own kids who love them too. These are very rich moist and flavorful with the butterscotch & marshmallow making them distinctive. I have found that I need to cook them for 28 minutes or else they are slightly undercooked. (My original 18 yr. old recipe card says 20-25 minutes.)",

And chocolate doesn\u2019t hurt either.  Me, not so much \u2013 because these are rich, gooey and intensely sweet.  I lined my pan with foil for ease in removing them from the pan and cutting.  Baking them at 350 degrees for 25 minutes was perfect.  I  threw these together last night in the time it took Hubs to fall asleep in front of the TV \u2013 now that\u2019s fast!  They turned out perfectly and this morning they were all ready to cut and package.  An easy, quick solution to satisfy a huge sweet tooth.",
