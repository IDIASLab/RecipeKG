I also used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I also omitted the nuts (made for toddler) and upped the shredded zucchini/carrots to a total of three cups.

I don't know if you're aware of this, reviewers who said that it was a mistake, but ovens are quite often calibrated differently depending on their age and brand. Also, altitude makes quite a difference in how baked goods turn out. When I cook my bread, it comes out perfectly at the time stated. However, I specifically included \"or until toothpick comes out clean\" to ensure that everyone else who made this bread would take it out at the right time. Perhaps before you review, you should a) read the recipe more closely and b) pay more attention to the things you're baking.",

I used 1.25 cups AP flour and 1.25 cups white whole wheat flour 3 eggs and I put in about 1/3 cup grapeseed oil. I also cut back the nutmeg and cloves a bit as they were for my boys (also left out nuts and raisins for my picky eaters) - if I was making them just for me I'd have done all the spices and tried it without the oil. They came together beautifully (I made muffins - took 22 min to bake) and each boy has already eaten three (I just took them out of the oven). They are very moist and flavorful. Thanks Nicole for the wonderful recipe!!",

So 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 cup all purpose. I also used 3 whole eggs instead of bothering with the eggwhite business and omitted the nutmeg (didn't have any) raisins and nuts.
