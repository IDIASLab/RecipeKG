I also used ham to season the beans that I had left over from a Sunday dinner in the freezer. These beans were great. I would not change a thing. I cooked them in the crockpot on low overnight and then turned the crockpot up to high when I got up in the morning and let them cook for 3 more hours or so. They were soooooo good. My three year old who hardly eats anything loved them. She even asked for seconds and I had to fry her some chicken to go with the second bowl.Thanks for the great recipe.",

I joined this website just so I could comment on this recipe. \n\nI soaked the dry beans overnight, threw them in the crockpot and decreased water to 3 cups. Added a 1/2 tsp of dry mustard and two slices of bacon in with all the other ingredients, and set the crockpot on low for eight hours. I came home from work and walked in the door and .. oh .. my .. god. The smell alone was enough to warrant the effort. Upon eating them, I died. Seriously. So good that I died. I'm using the allrecipes review forum as a medium from the other side. \n\nExcellent recipe.",

The long cooking definitely adds a richness and depth of flavor.\n\nI added mustard in with the ketchup mixture, and a half pound of partially cooked bacon and some leftover grilled bratwurst.  \n\nI also found the beans quite soupy, though that may be because I cooked them in a cast iron Dutch oven and couldn't drain them well after the initial boil. (The soupiness was corrected with cooking after the first three hours at 225 and then for 1/2 hour at 400 before serving, as I was baking muffins.)\n\nNext time I think I will omit the maple syrup and use only the brown sugar, and again add mustard and bacon.

Here's how I came to the two average. The flavor is terrible. Too sweet, no kick and no dimension. The cheapest canned beans have more complex flavor. For technique, I would give this recipe five stars. This has got to be the way to cook beans for perfect texture. The problem here is in the ingredients. It should have been a red flag when there was no vinegar, no mustard, no roasted peppers, etc. The Worcestershire sauce and chili powder  are no match for the syrup, molasses and brown sugar. I'll use this recipe as a guide to come up with beans that please a Midwestern crowd.",

I added a little less water after hearing it was too soupy, but mine actually turned out a little dry, so I would stick to the recipe.
