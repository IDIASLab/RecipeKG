I was a little worried because I made them for a group of 12, but after eating them, I printed out the recipe for everyone per request. A few minor changes: I used more breadcrumbs, and before throwing them on bbq, I fried on a skillet with minimal oil to get them nice and firm so they wouldn't fall through the grill. I served with \"Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce\" from this site, and it was an A+ dinner that I will continue to make for the rest of my life! Thanks DC Katie",

I did add a little more sun-dried tomatoes and herbs and also some minced garlic but we are garlic loving family! Also instead of \"folding\" in the feta I made two thin patties added feta put the two together and mashed and pinched the sides together to keep closed. I didn't really understand the folding in thing. I would need to see someone do it to be know what they are talking about. I also used Tzatziki sauce on the burgers as a condiment. I will definitely make it again!",

I topped with leftover homemade tzatziki sauce (from the chicken gyro souvlaki pita recipe on this site REALLY good try it) red onions tomato and lettuce in hopes of salvaging but it just had no taste at all. Only advice I can give if you do want to make this is to make sure and use one pound of chicken and do make 5 burgers. Bigger is NOT better with this recipe the seasonings are so subtle that you need the less meat to more seasoning ratio. Also the egg addition makes the mixture very ooey gooey. Folding in the feta is a little weird b/c it's so wet but by the third burger you'll be a pro at the insert/fold-over/pat into burger shape. I won't remake but a lot of folks on here will so if it interests you try it.",

Added egg Panko crumbs lemon jce and had some roasted red peppers w/garlic so added instead of sun-dried tomatoes. Very moist & delish. Added dried oregano and basil and dried cumin coriander ginger tarragon curry powder & garlic powder. Skipped salt & pepper. Had some fat free feta and put that into the ground chicken. Heated my favorite non-stick pan w/light olive oil and made the burgers in about 15 minutes. Great flavor and exremely moist & flavorful. Could use sun-dried tomatoes next time but this was great. Served with a simple salad and homemade honey mustard dressing. WOW!",
