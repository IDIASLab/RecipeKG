It s cool in Florida right now soup sounded good I had all the ingredients on hand and it just sounded like a recipe I might enjoy and I did! I think this is one of those recipes that you just need to adapt to your own personal taste. I made as written tasted then added more bouillon some freshly-ground pepper and quite a bit more Tabasco Sriracha and cayenne. You d never know there was a can of tomato soup in this It cooked down to a really nice texture tasted light but still somewhat robust...I'll make this again! ebrunworth thanks for sharing your recipe.",

I only tweaked a few  things, I added tomato bouillon and chicken bouillon instead of beef bouillon, and I omitted the hot sauce and only added the cayenne. It was one of the best soups I've had in a long time...and zero meat ...so happy about that. Thank you so much for this recipe I'll continue to make this for a long time to come.",
