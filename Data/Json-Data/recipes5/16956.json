I used an electric mixer to beat it, i made it 2 times in a couple of days and I loved the taste but the consistency was very clumpy and chewy, so the third time I made it I softened the cream cheese and I whipped it until it was like thick whipped cream. It filled up with air and was so much more light and fluffy.(beat at the highest speed your mixer will go).\nIt was so much better!\nThanks Rachel!",
