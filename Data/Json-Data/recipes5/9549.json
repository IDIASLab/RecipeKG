The only thing I did different was added frozen corn to the beans and rice while it was cooking. I will buy the packaged beans and rice so I can make this again! I thought it was weird to add the seasoning to the burrito but it made it sooo good. I only had two whole wheat flour tortillas so I just stuffed them full. My boyfriend kept asking where the meat was but when he was done eating he was full! Thanks for the easy recipe.",
