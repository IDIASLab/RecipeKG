Everything blends together nicely and it's not ketchupy at all. I always make this in a crock-pot since I bring this to my work pot-lucks. I mix all the sauce ingredients in a seperate bowl and pour over the Lit'l Smokies then stir to coat them. I cover and turn on high for about 2 hours until heated through and then turn to low to keep warm while serving all while stirring occasionally. It's a keeper in my recipe collection!!",
