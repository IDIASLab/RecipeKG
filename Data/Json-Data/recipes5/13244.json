Since my husband and I can't really do super spicy things, I soaked the sliced and deseeded peppers in a bowl of ice water for a few hours to take out some of the heat. I added a dash of basil to the mixture and it gave it a bit more flavor. Once I take them off the pan I place them between paper towels to soak up some of the excess grease from the bacon. These are a must-have at all of my potlucks at work, and my husband's platoon gatherings once a month. They're usually the first food to vanish!",
