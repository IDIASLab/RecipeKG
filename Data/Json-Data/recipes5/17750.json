I went ahead and attempted to bake a sheet of these and ended up with one big sticky mess - no cookies at all! Alternatively if the flour is doubled to 1 and 1/2 cups and you add 1 tsp baking soda they turn out wonderful! I spooned this batter into a bowl of sugar to coat them and then put them on an UNGREASED cookie sheet and baked them for 12 minutes at 350. They were great!",
