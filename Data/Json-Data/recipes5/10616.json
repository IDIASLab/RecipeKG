I made it with a slight variation - did not have cayenne pepper and used paprika and did not have parsley so left it out but it was all good at the end and very surprised with the taste it gave. Only warning is that the mushroom while saut\u00e9ing may release heaps and heaps of water and would affect cooking the fish - may need to consider saut\u00e9ing the mushrooms until all the liquids have evaporated.",
