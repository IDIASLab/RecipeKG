If you make it as per the recipe, it tastes like beef stroganoff without garlic and an over abundance of salt and worcestershire sauce.  I had to eat it, since I went to the trouble of making it, but I never would again.  There are lots of GOOD stroganoff recipes out there.  There is no reason to use this one.",
