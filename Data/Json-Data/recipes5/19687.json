I make something similar but use light brown sugar one cookie sheet 4 unsalted matzos stir 1 cup chopped pecans into the caramel right before spreading on the matzohs and bake the caramel on the matzos at 350 for 7 minutes. Then take out add 1 cup chocolate chips put back in oven for 2 minutes take out spread then add sliced almonds and pat them down while chocolate is still wet. Thanks for posting this variation. This toffee is worth the effort!!!! Everyone who tastes it likes it. Seriously!",
