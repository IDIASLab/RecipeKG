I used chicken breasts and marinated them in a ziploc bag for about 5 hours before baking. I also doubled the marinade to make sure the chicken was completely covered and so that we would have plenty of sauce with the meal. I also added carrots and extra pieces of fresh garlic. I will make it again! THANKS",

I only made a few changes: Used chicken breasts b/c that's what I had; marinated the chicken for about 30 in. in Mojo Criollo b/c my husband really enjoys the kick; and used packaged pre-sliced potates. To save washing a bowl I also just sprinkled the lemon lime and dressing over everything before covering and baking. After 45 minutes I sprinkled shredded Italian cheese Italian seasoning and baked uncovered a few minutes more. Yum yum!",

Also used the salad dressing that has oil in (not fat free) as this gives a better coating and keeps moisture & flavour in. To give this a FAB presentation and just add a little something I served this over a bed of fresh baby spinach & rocket leaves with some halved cherry tomatoes alongside - it looked like something you order in a restaurant!! I will make this again - perhaps vary the dressing to change it a bit. Thanks!",
