I like to make them as muffins because it's the perfect serving size (these freeze great and take seconds to thaw - an no-fuss healthy snack!) I did make the following adjustments: 1 tsp. vanilla whole wheat flour 1 tablespoon flax seeds. Makes approx 9-10 muffins. Bake for 15 minutes in a greased non-stick muffin tin. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!",
