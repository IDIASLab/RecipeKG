That seems to be due to the 2 t. of chili powder that over-powered the other spices. \nI cut the red pepper flakes down to 1/8t, which still gave it a bite (hot, but not overly so). \nIt would have been nice to know what size the onions and tomatoes should be, as there are no 'cup' measurements.  Next time I will cut the chili powder to 3/4t. in hope the Indian spice flavor will stand out better.  And, I'll put in spinach or swiss chard toward the end.",
