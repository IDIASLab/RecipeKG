If you are relying on a chocolate taste think again. These would do well as a sandwiching cooking. I will try again and add cocoa or just leave all the chocolate out and add almond extract and poopy seeds.",

We don t like our cookies overly sweet so we thought the amount of sweetness was perfect for us. Should you choose to make this recipe and add chocolate chips use a serrated knife to cut the cookie dough or it will break apart on you.",

By far the best cookie for my needs. Yes I have a prescription. Other than butter and cashews I used the recipe as is. But adding more chocolate and espresso powder is a great idea. Enjoy.",
