I read all the reviews as I always do and yes there are postive and negative always but that didn't scare me away.I think the taste is fabulous. I use jarred lemon juice a little less then 1/4 cup, I use a butter subsitite,smart butter 1/3 cup, fresh parsley I grew,and the rest of ingrediants on the list.I kept mine in the simmered marinade juice for probably 5 or more minutes and let sit in a bowl after taking them out of juice prob 20 minutes before grilling because I didnt have skewers and hub went to the store to get them. I then reheated remaining marinade adding more butter and little more onion heated for another 5 to 10 min on simmer. Grilled the scallop on the grill 4 or so mins realizing they were sticking so I placed them in a disposable grill metal pan, and cooked a total of 8 more mins . They were absolutely perfect.I tested for doneness making sure white and right texture.I served mine over steamed white rice placed scallops on top poured on marinade that had simmered and a side of garlic broccoli. My  hub ravved saying how good these were, better than a resturaunt and alot more of it. We used large sea scallops btw.Enjoy :)",

It's simple enough to prepare and tastes like you put a lot into it.I served with a loaf of french bread to soak up the leftover marinade. Instead of skewering the scallops and risking losing the smaller pieces we put them in a double-sided grate with a handle on it. It makes it easier to turn them and uses much less time than skewering.",
