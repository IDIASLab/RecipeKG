The only thing i would do differently is maybe poke some holes in the flesh with a toothpick the filling was very good but the way you pour it all in the sweetness only effected the very bottom of the squash.  I would also mix the stuffing and the chicken stock together before filling them, this way all the stuffing is made, some of the top was completely dry.\n\nI will make this again!",

I also scored the squash as another reviewer suggested and rubbed the inside of the squash with a bit of brown sugar (my family has a sweet tooth). Also taking another reviewer's suggestions, I mised all the ingredients in a bowl (sugar and the butter that I melted) and then put it in the squash. I didn't have the garlic powder (we go through it a lot and I just happened to be out) and forgot about the onion powder. It was great without these things.  Thanks so much for this recipe. It will be used again and again. Oh and I was cooking a brisket and had to hold these in the oven for about 80 minutes and they were fall apart tender. Wouldn't change a thing.",
