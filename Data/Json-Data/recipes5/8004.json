The nice thing is, this needs to rest before serving so you can finish up the rest of the meal. \nI used a deep dish 8 x 8 pan.  If you don't have one that size use a standard 9 x 9 pan.  Comte cheese may be difficult to find, use Gruy\u00e8re or another good melting cheese if Comte is not available.   Remember to salt each layer of potatoes.  Comfort food at its best.",

I couldn't find Comte cheese at my local market and didn't have time to go searching for it so substituted an aged Gruyere and it worked fine. Otherwise I made it per the recipe directions. I may experiment with infusing the cream with herbs adding caramelized onions to each layer using half and half or using other cheeses.
