Our FAVORITE makes it a little less rich (less eggs),a lot more rice and chicken, and with just-a-little thinner broth.  I will adjust this recipe to our tastes next time;but this was a wonderful example of Greek Lemon Rice soup.  Thank you so much,for the recipe!  I suspect the reviews that said it was too salty, were using 'boullion' or a brand of soup base that was very salty. My brand soup base \"Vogue\" did not have a lot of salt (I bought it at an health food store). Also, I never add the rice into the large pot;but only in the INDIVIDUAL serving bowls; I mix it in JUST prior to serving. It works better for leftovers;you never wind up with puffed up rice mush this way. :)",

First I do not precook the rice, I added olive oil to pan, and cooked the chopped onion, carrots,celery and rice for about 10 min. Than I added the broth, lemon juice, 1/2 cup white wine, and 1 can of \"Creamed Chicken soup\" instead of the butter and flour. I used only FOUR egg yolks. I also did not add more chicken. Prepared this way my boys really liked it - a good thickness, but not too thick. Really GOOD!!!",

This is a definite keeper! I do want to mention that instead of canned chicken broth I used real chicken broth from a whole chicken (4.25 lbs) I boiled for the recipe. I then shredded the meat from the whole chicken to add to the soup. I also added 2 teaspoons of Greek seasoning. Lastly, I used a full cup of the veggies instead of the 1/2 cup it called for.\nThanks!",

His family is Greek, he had me add a total of about 12 lemons, he said \"you just cant have too much lemon!\" The key to making it creamy is at the end. You put the hot broth into a food processor or blender and turn it on. Add the egg/lemon juice mixture in a slow stream to the broth and keep blending for a few minutes until it is frothy.  You would never guess there is egg in the finished product. I LOVE this soup!",
