The recipe makes a lot of bread so I would recommend spliting it into more than two pans. I used two pans and split the rest between mini loaf pans. My 2 year old daughter loves the mini loaves. My only change would be to reduce the molasses. Next time I might increase the honey and decrease the molasses because it is a very strong flavor. Overall a recipe I will use again!",

I was in a hurry--and I think that helped. Make sure you have good yeast. I just made one loaf--cut the recipe in half. Thank you so much for the recipe; I hope your son is healthy and happy.

I added probably 2 to 2 1/2 cups more flour. I made it in my kitchen aid mixer..heavy duty one. I mixed it on Speed 2 until it just came away from sides. Also my flour was freshly ground whole wheat from the farmers market. This recipe is big! I got 12 buns 1 10\"round 2 --9 1/2 x 5 1/2 loaves. The texture is light and the taste is lovely. I found my bread ready in 25 minutes. I used a thermometer to 200degrees. I think you could make this recipe in any shape.",

The only warning I'd like to give is that it yields four loaves (not two) so make sure you have extra loaf pans! Also because of all the grains it needs a bit of help rising. I add about 8-10 Tbs. of Vital Wheat Gluten (Bobs Red Mill can be found in any supermarket) and it rises very well. The last bit of advice I'll give you is that due to the abundant amount of loaves this recipe yields I like to thickly slice this bread and lay out the slices in a gallon freezer ziploc (with wax paper between the slices) and freeze them. I just take out a slice for my breakfast toast it and slather with butter and jam and I have breakfast for weeks - and there's still enough to give one or two loaves away.",

This made quite a bit of bread! My bread pans are a little smaller than 9x5\" so I knew I'd have more than two loaves but I ended up with five fat loaves which was awesome. I did add a few cups more flour but that's to be expected in a bread recipe--the amount is quite variable depending on humidity and such. Thanks so much for the recipe!",

I made it pretty much as written except I used home-canned pumpkin instead of applesauce and cut the amount of honey and molasses in half. The only complaints I have about this recipe is that it could use a bit more salt and that the dough was very sticky. I had to add at least half a cup of extra flour...but that might be because I used the pumpkin instead of applesauce. Other than that this bread is absolutely delicious...even family members who turn their noses up at whole-grain breads were eating this and enjoying it! The texture is nice and soft with all that wonderful graininess from the cracked wheat and sunflower seeds. The oatmeal gave it a lovely texture as well. I found that I needed WAY more than two loaf pans because this made A LOT of dough. I used 1 9x5\" loaf pan one smaller loaf pan and one long sandwich bread loaf pan in addition to two 9\" round pans that I used to make into pull-apart rolls. Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe! I'll be making it again!",

                "reviewBody": "I'm crazy about the ingredients in this bread but not the proportioning of them. Would recommend quadrupling flax seed cooking oats sunflower seeds and cracked wheat... and doubling water applesauce honey molasses and oil. Would also recommend oiling dough once placed in pan for final rise... and sprinkling with flax seed cooking oats sunflower seeds and cracked wheat. Crust gets darker than desirable before bread finishes baking; covering dough with aluminum foil in late stages of baking would help.",
