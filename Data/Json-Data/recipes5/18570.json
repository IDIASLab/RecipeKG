I needed a sauce to diffuse a little of the heat. I made this exactly according to recipe only I omitted the red pepper as the meat was hot enough on it's own. What I did was take the cold meat from the fridge brushed this sauce on it and just warmed it through in the oven until the sauce had browned a bit and the meat was warmed through. This turned out nicely--I think the only thing I was missing was onion and garlic. I'll make this again but I'll saute some fresh onion and fresh minced garlic in a little butter before adding the sauce ingredients. Honestly it's four and a half stars.",

Then added in remaining ingredients. I reduced the pepper to about a teaspoon and the cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon for just a little kick. If you use the full tablespoon as written I think it would be blazing hot! I poured the sauce over a chuck roast in my slow cooker and let it go all day and we used the meat and sauce for delicious bbq beef sandwiches. Really loved the tang from the balsamic. Really good!",
