I skipped the quinoa and served it with naan (traditional Moroccan food is served with Khobz, a flatbread, so any flatbread will do).  I also skipped the cherry tomatoes since I didn't have any, and I didn't miss them.   Lastly, I had no hummus either, so I just topped it with a dollop of yogurt to cut the heat a little.  I may add some spinach next time for added nutrients.  Great to find a vegetarian dish my meat-loving family will eat.",
