I spread the sauce directly on the meat & added the onion, and layered on 4 pieces of uncooked bacon, then added the rest of the sauce. Since the meat was already trimmed lean the bacon was added for additional flavor, the brisket had been in the freezer forever. The result was simply Fantasic! My husband and I will keep this recipe forever! Can't wait till the whole family crowd is here, the kids and grandkids will love it too! Thanks for such a great easy recipe!",

I've made it twice, both times using a smaller cut brisket, so I cut everything in half,except the garlic,and only used a quarter cup molasses(my husband's not a sweet person!). The first time I made it, I used the beer and poured the sauce over the meat, but at the end of cooking, the sauce was all watery and bland. I don't know if you are supposed to use a rack in the roasting pan, maybe that would have been different, oh well. So the second time I measured out a quarter cup beer and put it in the sauce mixture and poured the rest of the beer over the meat along with some extra liquid smoke, and put it in the oven without the sauce over it, after about 3 hours I took it out and dumped out the majority of the juice and then covered it with the sauce, put it back in for a couple hours, took it out and sliced it up, put it back in for an hour, and OMG was it good.",

Used one 6 oz. bottle of cayenne pepper sauce (I used Trappey's Red Devil, don't worry, it's not hot) 4. Mixed all the ingredients, except the onions which I just threw on top of the brisket, then poured it over the brisket 5. I used an oven bag (these are great for slow cooking).  Save the leftover liquid (there will be a lot) as a makeshift BBQ sauce. You can use the oven bag as a gravy seperator by holding it up for a minute letting the fat flow to the top, then poke a hole in the bottom of the bag pouring the liquid into another container. If you have an actual gravy seperator, that's even better.",
