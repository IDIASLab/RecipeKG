First of all, the amount of butter and garlic is WAY overkill. Throw that amount aside and use your own judgment \u2013 a little butter, a little garlic and a squeeze of lemon.  Then\u2026 40 minutes to cook fish? If you want great, golden color and perfectly cooked fish bake it at 400 degrees for 12-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your filets. And don\u2019t bother to turn it! Not only is it unnecessary, you risk breaking it apart!  I sprinkled the fish with paprika before baking for additional color, and fresh, not dried, parsley after.  Also, I didn\u2019t use tilapia (because I really hate it \u2013 tastes muddy to me).  I made this with grouper, although any mild-flavored white, flaky fish would work \u2013 like cod, haddock, flounder or orange roughy.  This dish, with the above changes, was much improved  - nicely done, great color and appropriately seasoned.  Just as with a good steak, if you\u2019ve got a good piece of fish it really needs nothing more than salt, pepper and, with fish, a little lemon.",

I've tried most other tilapia recipes on this site and find them to all either be too similar, too complex, or not my style.  40 minutes @ 375 is WAY too much though.  I could already tell just by my experience with baking tilapia and reading other reviews.  I tried 35 minutes @ 350 and still found it to be too much.  I don't think I'd lower the temp anymore though.  I might try 350 @ 30 minutes next time around.  I added 2 tablespoons of prepared dijon style mustard based on some other shrimp scampi recipes I've tried and enjoyed.  I think this gave it a more interesting flavor.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of white wine.  I like others only flipped the fish once... at the 20 minute mark.  I also placed about 3/4 of a pound of uncooked medium sized shrimp in there with the tilapia and took them out at the same 20 minute mark that I flipped the fish at.  They were an 'appetizer' and they turned out perfectly cooked and very tasty.  I'd probably give the original recipe a 3/5 but based on the unique concept and potential I give it 4/5.",

I cut the amount of butter in half to reduce the calories and used the juice from one lemon to keep the liquid amount about the same. I didn't have whole garlic on hand, so just used the refrigerated minced kind.  The flavor was wonderful and there was still a good amount of sauce left in the pan even after reducing the butter. I would give it 5 stars, but since I felt the need to make those modifications I'm going with 4.",
