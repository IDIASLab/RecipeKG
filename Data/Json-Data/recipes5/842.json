The dish is finished with a gremolata, which is a mix of chopped parsley and lemon zest. In Milan, ossobucco is typically served with a saffron risotto.",

I  found 55 min. cooking time not enough time to get the shanks tender, so i finished it in the oven at 325 for 30 min. more.I served the shanks over  Penne  Pasta.\nMy mom made it this way and this is how i remember it.\nThis recipe could use more seasoning such as rosemary, basil and garlic.",

Very good recipe!",
