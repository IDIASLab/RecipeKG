I would give it a 4 only because five stars for me means my eyes roll up into my head and we didn't quite get there. What I would say about this is that it is strangely difficult to find recipes for a pork shoulder roast (which is ALWAYS on sale at the super market. I LOVE port shoulder roast and usually brown it (lots of smoke and hot fat) then cook it all day real slow. This was pretty easy albeit not available until the next day but very easy and very good. My one complaint about the recipe is that it should give cooking time per pound because my roast was 8.5 lbs. I stuck a meat thermometer into the middle and cooked it to 160 degrees before turning off the oven. I was happy with that. You don't need to change anything with this recipe.",

The key is being very generous with the spices. If you can find a roast that has not been trimmed to death - even better (more flavor). The idea of searing the slices gives a great texture and is a step you do not want to pass up. Great recipe! Enjoy!",
