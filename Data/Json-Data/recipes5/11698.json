I think the broth should be cut in half for the amount of butter/flour (rou\u00e9) being made and possibly there should be more flour put in since the mushrooms also give off moisture. Either that or cook the mushrooms in the butter until softened; remove from heat and keep warm; Start the pan fresh with melting 2 TBSP butter over Medium heat; add 2 TBSP flour and create the rou\u00e9. Slowly add ONE (1) cup beef broth to the rou\u00e9 stirring until combined. Add the mushrooms back in then simmer on Low heat 10 minutes to let everything soak in and thicken. Add the half-n-half and pepper to taste simmer until dairy has heated up and everything is combined. Turn off the heat and allow mixture to simmer another 5 minutes on the cooling burner.",
