It can be made on the lighter side if you wish.  Use it to dip veggies or decadent foods such as fried onion rings or chicken strips. Stores well in the refrigerator. To lighten the calorie count, use light mayonnaise and light sour cream. You can even substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream if you like, but it will alter the taste somewhat.",

A most excellent fresh tasting dressing with a perfect balance of each of its components. Other than using equal amounts of the mayonnaise and sour cream I prepared this exactly as written. I loved the combination of herbs and I was particularly fond of the addition of the minced red pepper which added a lot of character - in flavor in color and in texture. One of the best dressings I've tried from this site; one that could easily make me eat a lot more salad! I served this with a tossed salad of baby spinach Romaine lettuce English cucumber and sliced avocado.",

Those two ingredients impart a nasty taste so why use them when fresh garlic and fresh onions are so readily available and inexpensive? Most people like a fresh taste on their fresh salad and this dressing delivers in spades! The only change I made was to double the lemon juice because upon the initial taste I wanted a little more bite to it. But that was just how I felt on that particular day. That change was quite minor and totally subjective. It's just about as close to a perfect ranch as you can concoct. Edited to add: For the reviewer who felt the shallot overpowered the dressing's taste this problem can be obviated by blanching the minced shallots for about 30 seconds before adding to the mix. It will tame the sharpness of raw shallot and help it \"play nice\" with the other ingredients.",
