I ended up cooking it for 40 minutes total (my grill is charcoal and a little harder to \"turn down\" to low) and the bacon was nicely cooked and the corn was VERY soft. I would highly recommend this for store bought corn of dubious age but for FRESH farm-stand corn I will stick with a quick turn on the grill so that the kernels are still crunchy and juicy. All that said this corn was good with a slightly spicy bacon-y flavor that DH and I both enjoyed. We ate the bacon separately since it didn't stick to the corn. Four stars out of five because the super long cook time would murder a really fresh ear of corn.",

I used a sharpie to write what flavor was inside. Grilled them on a gas grill heated to 375-425 for about 55 minutes turning every 8-10 minutes(the temp would fluctuate when we opened the lid to turn). No need for butter or salt as the bacon left a smoky salty flavor as well as the different seasoning. I used chile powder on a few garlic pepper on a few and seasoning salt on a few. Going to try other different flavors next time. What a hit! My husband really loved this but who wouldn't love something grilled with BACON. Thank you for an awesome receipe!",
