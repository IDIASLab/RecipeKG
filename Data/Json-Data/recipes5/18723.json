I put some of the extra meat in the fridge for later and still had a lot of leftover meat.  I filled my muffin pan with scoops of meat.  Each individual muffin tin holds the same as a typical sandwich.  I put the muffin tin in the freezer and froze the individual serving size leftovers.  After about 2 hours I took the tin out removed the meat  muffins.  Next they went into a ziploc and they will not all stick together.  To reheat just pop one in the microwave on 50% power.  These are great for a quick sandwich, with rice, with beans, or with eggs.",

I am seriously keeping this recipe forever. This is the perfect weekend bbq/potluck food, and went great with grilled corn on the cob and red potato salad. Also, when you shred the meat you can remove most of the fat. I think you could do without the oil. I used kraft honey bbq sauce - just what I had on hand. SOOOO tasty. You can't stop eating this. ",

                "reviewBody": "I love this recipe! I've made it several times and everyone always goes crazy for it. I use a 6-7 lb. bone-in shoulder. I've used a deboned and a bone-in and the bone-in definitely comes out a little tastier. I leave out the oil and the chicken broth, because I think the broth makes it too juicy and I just don't think the oil is necessary. Instead, I just put in the entire bottle of barbeque sauce. I use like 10 cloves of garlic and a huge vidalia onion. You don't have to bother chopping up the onions or garlic too small because by the time it's done, they're all dissolved. I put in closer to 1/2 cup brown sugar, 8 or so drops of Liquid Smoke, two tablespoons of chili powder and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. In my opinion, and I think everyone I've fed this to would agree, the cinnamon is KEY. It makes it SO GOOD and adds such a depth of flavor. The recipe doesn't mention this, but make sure you put the roast in the slow cooker fat side up so it can drip down into the meat while it cooks. I cook it on low overnight for about 12 hours, then pull it and remove all the fat, strain the liquid and add it all back to the cooker for another 4 hours or so. The leftovers really do taste better every day. Make sure to make a semi-sweet southern slaw to go along with it - HEAVEN!  ;)",

I followed the ingredients increased for my size of roast, except for using dry mustard in lieu of prepared and adding liquid smoke. I cooked on high two hours and then low for seven. I took the meat out and it shredded with complete ease two hours before serving, then placed back in the crockpot. There was alot of liquid and needed to reduce a good two cups worth after placing the shredded meat back in the crockpot. Added a bit of BBQ sauce and liquid smoke at that point to give the meat a bit more flavor, even though it was tender, still lacked that BBQ flavor. After another two hours this was the best tasting pork I've evern made in the slow cooker. Our guest even requested to take home some for lunch the next day. I'm not sure I'd add the broth next time, I feel the fat in the meat made plenty of juice.  *Note when placing meat in crockpot, always leave the fat side on top so the juices sink down into the meat while cooking...read that somewhere.",

Although it was very easy to get together and the pork turned out perfectly and just fell apart, the taste just wasn't doing it for me. It was way too sweet for me, I was hoping for more of that smoky flavor. If I make this again I won't be adding any sugar, maybe more vinegar and maybe some liquid smoke to give it that pulled pork flavor.",
