To add some kick to it, add a can of mixed veggies and decrease the chicken stock from 4 cups to 3 3/4 cups. Or you can add a can of beans to it. If you add beans, do not decrease the chicken stock. You can also add meat, sausage, ham, or even shrimp. If adding meat, no need to decrease chicken stock. You can add more salt or seasonings to taste.",

The salt amount seemed like WAY too much, and after reading the other review stating it was salty, I chose to only use one third the amount of salt (so for a half batch, I used 1 tsp instead of 1 tbsp). Am I ever glad I cut back! The seasonings were perfect, so I can't even imagine how salty it would be with the full amount. With the reduced salt, I really liked the overall flavor. It was a nice change of pace. The rice did come out a little mushy (even though I rinsed it first), so it would be a good idea to use a bit less liquid than called for.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is good and super easy to make. You could also add in some gandules (pigeon peas, drained/rinsed) and cooked cubed or diced ham to the rice cooker. However, please take some notes before proceeding to make this recipe as it really needs to be updated because it doesn\u2019t even match the author\u2019s original recipe. 1.41 oz of Sazon is the equivalent of 2 boxes. It should read 2 packets sazon, NOT  2 (1.41 ounce) package sazon. Also, when using sazon packets, there\u2019s really no need to add the additional salt. Since the recipe has you use chicken stock, I would omit the bouillon all together. Here\u2019s what I did after scaling recipe in half (5 servings): used 1.5 cups rice (jasmine is what I had), 1 \u00be cups chicken stock, 2 tbsp. tomato sauce, 1 tbsp olive oil, \u00bd tsp salt, 2.5 tsp homemade sazon (you would want to use 1 packet Sazon if you have it), and 1.5 tsp garlic powder. Omitted the bouillon. This was very good this way. Yes, lots of alterations were made here, but they were all very necessary. Otherwise, the recipe will come out extremely salty. If this recipe is ever updated, I\u2019ll try again as written and likely increase my rating.",

Which is 2 whole boxes of 8 packets each. I figured this was way too much and it was. The rice comes out orange like the photo and not yellow. It's not bad but could be much better. Next time i'll just use a few of the little packets inside the box which are 1 gram each. The flavor in arroz amarillo should be more subtle. But the rice did come out of my cooker the perfect consistency not mushy at all.",
