The lime dressing made it nice and zesty and I loved the idea of adding chiles and green olives. I will be making this again. The only things I did differently was I used red onion instead of white added a little bit of fresh cilantro and to the dressing added a teaspoon of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix. I really enjoyed this salad and so did my family. Thanks Lars.",

Even putting that aside the amount of oil seemed excessive so I cut it in half with good success. The warm potatoes soaked up the dressing quickly and there was no oil sitting in the bottom of the bowl. I charred the poblano peppers outside on the grill and you do get an occasional zing from the poblanos (not much it's subtle). I mixed up the dressing and thought it was a little bland so I added more lime juice and I tossed in some chopped red bell pepper for a pop of color. Nice side dish Lars.",
