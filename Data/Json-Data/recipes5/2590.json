I didn't bother pureeing the soup...rather I just used a food processor to chop the onion red pepper and garlic very fine before adding. I didn't use the pre-cooked rice either but added a little extra liquid and threw some dry rice in the pot while it simmered. It turned out perfect I will definitely do this one again. Great for a cold day with some warm crusty bread.",
