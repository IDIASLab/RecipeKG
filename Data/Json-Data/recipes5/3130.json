They stuck and were ruined on my electric non-stick griddle but worked out okay in a regular frying pan(go figure?). Certainly a healthy alternative to those with wheat allergies. I might make them again just not sure. They were a bit dense and doughy not light or fluffy like regular pancakes (or even rice based pancakes) but I assume that's the amaranth flour? Definitely worth a try at least once.",

I didn't have any trouble with the pancakes sticking to the pan as other reviewers did so my substitution may have been the key. The pancakes were a bit thin yet still fluffy (not dry) and the flavor was great. Will try adding just a bit extra potato starch next time to see if that makes them a little thicker.",
