She bought Kraft on sale for .77 cents.  Using good BBQ sauce is just as important as using good wine.  Use Jack Daniels or Famous Daves etc.  Stay away from the cheap sauces as they do affect the flavor of the foods. If you don't like sweet, don't use a sweet sauce. \nWe really loved this recipe.  If making this during the week, I season chicken with garlic powder, a little salt and pepper add a can of 99% chicken broth and throw in crockpot and cook on low for about 6 to eight hours.  When I get home I drain grease shred chicken and pour rest of ingredients over chicken for about an hour to blend flavors.  I use Famous Daves bold sassy barbeque sauce.  When making on the weekend I cook on high for about four hours, drain, shred chicken and pour rest of ing. over chicken and cook for about two hours more to blend flavors.  I also like to add a little onion and green pepper in the morning then put back into crockpot after draining.   We put it on hoagie rolls or steak rolls  that I brush with olive oil and broil till lightly brown.  Served with a green side salad and fresh cut up veggies and dip.  Yummy Yummy Yummy.

(Note: I only used 3 chicken breasts)  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it turned out perfectly.  For those who commented that the sauce was watery - shredding the chicken will help absorb it and make sure you are using a molasses based sauce and not a vinegar based sauce.  I live in Kansas City so we definitely know our BBQ and this turned out great!  Before serving the chicken, I brushed an olive oil and garlic salt mixture on the outside and inside of the bun and broiled for a few minutes until toasty.  I also found a Chipotle Cheddar Cheese by Sargento that was a nice addition.  Finished off with red onion slices.  Will definitely make this again.  Very good reheated too.  UPDATE: With the left over chicken from last night, I made a salad with black beans, corn, onions, and chipotle cheddar cheese.  I added the left over chicken and finished by drizzling a 2 part BBQ sauce, 1 part Ranch dressing mixture over the salad.  Very yummy!",

I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey barbecue sauce and the sauce was perfect.  The chicken is wonderful but the recipe also lends itself well to boneless pork ribs.  I threw them in the crockpot and poured the sauce over them.  In about 8 hours I had the most tender, juicy ribs ever!  Used the extra sauce to pour over the ribs once they had been served.
