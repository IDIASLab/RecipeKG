If you were here I would kiss you... on the lips.  ;-)\nWatching the video several times before I started helped me a great deal and, as directed, I followed the recipe fanatically, using a scale to measure *exactly* 12 ounces of flour and 1 cup of butter (226 grams). I am so delighted that I no longer suffer from pie-crust paranoia and I can't wait to experiment with new fillings. This first success was a cherry pie with a lattice crust but next week I'll attempt an apple. Interestingly, many people claim that a shortening-based recipe is superior,  but this recipe (and Martha Stewart's recipe that many people adore) prove that butter is a godsend to cooks and bakers everywhere.",

I did have to add a bit more water, but that is going to depend on your humidity anyway; it isn't the recipe's fault.  The crust is very flaky and delicious.  A good complement to savory dishes.
