I followed as written, but the center of the quiche was completely raw, and looked way too brown. I had to bake it 10 minutes more. I recommend just baking this for 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees and just skip the broiler step. If you do want it brown, broil for a minute at the very end, be sure to take it out of the oven immediately. Thanks for sharing :)",

I didn't have that problem at all. I added some mushrooms in with the red peppers and smashed down the pie crust after it had baked (it fluffed up a bit). Huge hit!!! 6 people are asking for the recipe. Glad to pass it on. Thanks so much. I will use this recipe countless times.",
