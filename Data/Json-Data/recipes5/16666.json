They are also nice because they are easy use ingredients on hand and don't have a lot of stuff in them (sometimes we need that around here for the kiddo!) My only \"warning\" and I use the term loosely is that some people may find them too sweet. It depends on your preference. The caramel taste is subtle. Again good for us maybe not what someone else is looking for. Overall we enjoyed them immensely. I would recommend cutting the recipe in half and giving them a try!",
