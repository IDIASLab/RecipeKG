I prefer to use fresh herbs because it elevates the dish to a whole new level.  I would use this marinade on other fish.  I would even suggest using this for a pork loin or pork chops.  I think the flavors would go really well with that type of protein.  I served this on a bed of parmesan polenta and topped it with a polenta cake.  I reserved some of the marinade to drizzle over the fish.  The marinade I reserved was put aside before I added the fish.  As to not contaminate it.  I highly recommend reserving some on the side.  It's really delicious.  I did DOUBLE the recipe knowing I was going to reserve some to drizzle.  Thanks for sharing.",
