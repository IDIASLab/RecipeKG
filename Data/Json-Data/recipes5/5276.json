As hoped for it was simple and easy and more importantly very tasty. The only substantive comment I would make is that the instructions say to start cooking the arctic char with the skin face up. Based on many other recipes I also read before picking this one all the others started with the skin face down and that is how I prepared it. Another thing: I decided not to drizzle the recommended 2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil over the greens after everything was done. I didn't feel it needed it. One last thing: I did not have mango on hand but the strawberries and roasted pecans were delicious on their own along with the char. Winner for a quick easy healthy and tasty way to prepared grilled arctic char",
