I'm going to try making this again and use less honey in the dressing. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

Added some dashes of salt and pepper and a couple of dashes of chipotle pepper( it needed a bit of something for a little spice) chilled for a little bit before eating and we really enjoyed it with our dinner!
