The only issue I had was I dont have an 'offical double boiler' I just use a pot of boiling waer with a glass pyrex bowl on top (have used this method for dozens of other double boiler instructions and had no problems). We after stirring forever I couldnt get it to thicken even before I added my egg. I took it off the double boiler and poured it all in a pot and put it right on the burner. It thickened almost instantly almost too quick had I not been right there. It turned out perfect. I just couldnt see it even getting hot enough the thicken with the double bolier. TASTED GREAT!

I decided to try it again and use corn starch. I also doubled the recipe by 1/2 (3 cups milk 3 egg yolks etc) and it worked excellent! I found the first time it settled down and didn't fill the 9\" dish to the top. This is it went right to the rim..a nice thick pie! Next time I make it I will probably add a tablespoon or so of butterscotch extract to give it a little more butterscotchy flavour.",
