This sausage has perfect balance between the sweet maple syrup and a little kick from the red pepper flakes, and when combined with spot on spices, you\u2019re in for a treat.  Admittedly, I\u2019ve been brand loyal to Jimmy Dean\u00ae Sausage for years, but this recipe gives it some stiff competition.  Thanks for sharing, very good recipe that definitely will be made again (and again).",
