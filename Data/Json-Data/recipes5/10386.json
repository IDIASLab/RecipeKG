I mixed the herbs and pepper with the olive oil for approximately an hour hoping to infuse a little more flavor into the oil before adding in the slices of potato, whether that made any difference - who knows.   Also, to give myself a head start, I nuked the potato in the microwave for a few minutes to partially cook it before slicing it. I simply tossed the slices in the olive oil mixture before putting it on a well oiled grill.   It made a great side dish with the marinated steak.   Good call if I may say so myself.",

I did 1/2 tsp. salt and a 1/4 tsp. of pepper cayenne pepper Italian seasoning onion powder and garlic powder. I pretty much followed the seasoning suggestions of Christina. I might just cut back the amount of black and cayenne pepper I used next time. Mine did take the full hour and I cut them about 1/4\". I will more likely make these again.

I baked mine for just shy of 45 min and they turned out good but I think i will leave them in for just a tad longer next time bc I like them really crispy however if you like a more tender fry 45 min seemed about right. 30 min for me was not brown enough but that could be personal taste. these have a hint if spice to them from the cayenne but its subtle however if you are at all sensitive to spice I would just omit this and they will still be delish. I did use the optiional step shown on the video and place my fries on a rack for the last 10-15 min. liked the added crispness but as CJ said not a necessary step. This one will me in my regular rotation.",

I must say I've never heard of the name of these, but they are good.  Definitely slice a tad thick or you will end up with almost like potato chips if you aren't careful.  Thanks for the recipe!",
