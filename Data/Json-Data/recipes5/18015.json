I use 2 cups brown sugar Preferably dark brown, Enough of the pineapple juice to make a wet sand consistancy, I add about a 1/4 cup of yellow mustard, 1 teaspoon ground cloves, and pour over ham then pour the rest of pineapple juice in pan and seal it with foil.  I bake at 325 for 2 hours completely covered and then for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees, I baste with the juices from the bottom of pan every 5 minutes.  If you completely seal the ham in the beginning, you will never have dried up juices. This is for an 8 lb or so ham.  For a 12 lb ham, I would bake sealed for about 3 or 4 hours sealed and then the same for the last 15 minutes.  I also thicken the juices at the end with a flour and water mix.  My ham and sweet gravy has always been the talk of the dinner.  My granddaughter always requests it during the holidays.",
