The only difference is we add a can of crushed pineapple on top of the cake then the Cool Whip topping. Sprinkle coconut on top of  Cool Whip & refrigerate. Decadent, yummy & easy to make.

Definitely cook the cake 28-30 minutes so it is completely done- you will be pouring a lot of liquid on it right after it comes out of the oven! Also I found that letting it sit on the countertop for 4 hours after pouring on the liquids allows it to cool completely absorb the liquids & firm back up. After the 4 hours I ice it with the whipped topping and coconut. Store in the fridge until it's gone...which will be in one day!!",
