I roasted some brussel sprouts and tossed them in to the hot tub as well! I started this at 12:30pm and by 3:30, it was fork tender and just waiting for us to catch up.

I dont think the flour quite thickend it enough. Will have to try this again cooking veggies less on stove. Or maybe not cook them on the stove at all, and just saute onion and garlic and then pour stock and beer and flour in to make the 'gravy' part.
