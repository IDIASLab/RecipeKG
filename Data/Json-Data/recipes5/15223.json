These start out frying up nicely but before it is even time to flip they completely fell apart into one big crumble in the skillet. I never touched or moved them but they just fell apart into one big pile of crumbly mush and I even added flour. After they were cooked thru and cooled I was able to smash them back into shape but it wasn't an easy task nor was it pretty. Sorry but as written these did not work for me. I really liked the taste so I might try to tweak them to see if I can't make them work again.",
