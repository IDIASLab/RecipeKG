It's sweet spicy and mmmmmm so good. When I worked as a waiter at a restaurant a few years back my favorite dish was this pork with plum sauce. It was delicious and one of the most popular dishes at the restaurant. This sauce is very similar to that one. One thing I've modified however is I first saute the garlic and onion in 1 tblsp of EVOO. I realized the recipe doesn't even call for oil but I reflexively did it and it was a-ok. I actually prefer it that way because I first saute the garlic and onion get all those yummy juice sizzling and then mix in the ham vinegar brown sugar ginger and red pepper. Oh and I also used rice vinegar instead because I wanted a more oriental cuisine taste from my sauce. Love it!",
