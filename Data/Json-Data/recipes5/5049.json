I cut the recipe in half and cut the olive oil with a little melted butter (a little trick I just learned from a local restaruant). You can easily put the dry ingredients in a little tupperware container to store for next time then add the rest when ready to serve.  Perfect with a glass of wine!",

I left out the black and red pepper because I had radiation treatments for a throat cancer and my mouth and throat can no longer take the heat. Even with these omissions, it is delicious. I have already eaten half of the loaf of bread with this. A definite keeper and so easy to do. Any cook should have all of the ingredients in house. By the way, the cancer is gone. Praise the Lord.",
