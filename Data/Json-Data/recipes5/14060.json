Boy was I tempted to use garam masala (that my husband's Mom made) instead of the curry powder (real indian curries never use curry powder please!). Well my husband loved this said it tasted like his Mom's. The only thing I did different was I cooked it more traditionally-I browned the onions in oil first then added the ginger garlic then the spices stirred it for a couple minutes then proceeded with the chicken and continued. It did need a little water added to it. Thanks for the easy recipe!",

Madras Tamarind Hot Curry (purchased at Cost Plus) and it came out great. Also added more red pepper (we like it HOT!) and a few grinds of sea salt. Since I planned to use a slow cooker after heating the oil and combining the ingredients I reduced the oil by half. After putting the mixture in the cooker I added about 4 ounces of chicken stock and let it cook for around 2 hours. Really tasty served over basmati rice. Thanks for the great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "As far as curry goes this recipe is a good basic recipe. Easy to prepare and has some good flavor and heat. However I changed a few things as others did as well. I grinded the spices down to bring out more flavor and make the dish easier to eat. I also added some stock and cream to finish it off so that there would be extra sauce to have with my rice. I'd add additional fresh red peppers (diced w/ seeds) if you want more heat. Either reduce the sauce by simmering it uncovered or add a cornstarch slurry at the end. Also I think this dish could really go well with some veggies. I'll put some baby corn asparagus or eggplant in next time. If you want to add some presentation quality to it I think some deep fried julienned sweet potato would go well as a garnish or fried onions to add some contrasting crunch. Much love to your cooking...cheers.",

I added a mug of boiling water and 250g halved cherry tomatoes (I would have used chicken stock and/or chopped tomatoes but I didn't have any) 2. The cardamon pods were killers when I bit into one. 3. The cloves were killers when I bit into one! 4. The coriander seeds were killers when I bit into one!! (the above could have done with being ground). 5. The black peppercorns wern't great whole either. All-in-all not the best (infact probably the worst) curry I've had although it has some of the basics of a good curry. I'm honestly suprised at the number of 4-5 stars reviewers have given it.",
