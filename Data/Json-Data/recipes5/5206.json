This recipe is my recreation of a dish that was made by a man named Botsy, years ago, in the Rocky Mountains. It's delicious and enhances fresh trout without overpowering it. These could also be prepared in foil packets on a camping trip over an open fire. Although we camp, I don't often include a bottle of sherry in my kitchen box. When you add the sherry, pour a glass for yourself.",

However my husband who LOVES lemon thought the dish rocked. The only sub I made was using marsala wine instead of sherry since I didn't have any. I'll make again but without nearly as much lemon. Oh and you can finish this on the stovetop if you don't want to heat up the oven; after cooking the mushrooms etc. I added the trout and cooked for about 10 minutes flipping twice. I used a cast-iron skillet so this was a one-pot dish!",
