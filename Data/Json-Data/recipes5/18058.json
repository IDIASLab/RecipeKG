Then I put a layer of onions and apples, then the chops, then another layer of onion and apples. On each layer i lightly dusted with salt and pepper and then sprinkled with a brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg mix - probably used double-triple the amt of brown sugar called for. I cooked it on medium for about 5 1/2 hours. It turned out GREAT. The pork really soaked in the flavor since it was sandwiched between the onion and apples(used golden delicious, by the way, sliced thick, and the texture was perfect). The flavor of this was perfect for an autumn evening - I love this combination!",

I'd like to pass on what I learned:  The amount of ingredients were on the mark, except for the pepper.  1)make sure you slice the onion and sweet potatoes very thin - they will then cook within the hr. 2) Cut the apples thicker - not too thick - since they take a shorter amt of time to cook (if too thin they will turn to mush)  3) Use the \"GRANULATED\" brown suger (I used the old fashioned kind the first time and it wouldn't melt - the pepper got stuck in the sugar - I had to mush in down - not a pretty sight!).  I also cut back on the pepper the second time - we love pepper, especially on sweet potatoes but found that 1 tsp. was sufficient).  I cooked this in a corningware baking dish with cover and the second time it was a pretty presentation and everyone loved it.  It is fun and easy to prepare.  One pork chop per serving is not enough in my house!!!  Believe it or not - it is a light meal.  You might want to serve a salad with it since some were looking for a third chop!  The pork really picks up the juices while it is cooking.  This is a keeper and a really quick meal - thanks Ashbeth.",

I did mix cinnamon with the sugar and made a little more than what is called for. Next time I would not use the onions. My family did not think the onions blended well with the sweet potatoes and apples. I also did not season the casserole with the 2 tsp. of pepper and the 1 tsp of salt. Somehow I didn't think that would go well with the sugared potatoes and apple slices. I would suggest that if you make this recipe, you microwave the sliced sweet potatoes for a couple minutes to give them a head start in cooking. I found the potatoes were a little hard and the meat a little overdone, following the recipe. I think if you started the potatoes, you could cook this recipe for about 45 minutes and get juicier chops.",

Also, I had to bake them for an extra 15 minutes or so because the potatoes were still crunchy.  I recommend tossing the apples, onions, potatoes, and seasonings together before putting them over the pork chops because all of the seasonings stayed on the top and I had a layer of veggies/fruit that were way too seasoned and a layer without seasonings.  Last thing, add a little bit of garlic powder to the pork chops before putting them in the pan, it really adds a nice flavor.  This was a HUGE hit with my family and they beg me to make it over and over again!",

I did adapt the recipe slightly, partly based on earlier comments, and the result brought raves from my non-pork-fan husband.  First, I dredged the chops in a flour/salt/pepper mixture and browned them in a small amount of margarine in the frying pan.  I then layered the onions, potatoes and apples twice, dusting each layer with salt, pepper, brown sugar and cinnamon.  I sprinkled the top with nutmeg, and drizzled 1/2 - 1 cup apple cider over all.  I then covered the pan and slow-baked it for slightly more than 2 hours at 325 degrees.  The result was a fabulous dinner, with tender meat and perfectly done potatoes and apples.  We were very happy with the experiment; my husband's final comment was, \"Well, this sure is a keeper!\"",

I took this basic idea and completely  modified it for a slow cooker. First, I mixed the onion, apples (chunked instead of rings), 1/2 cup dried chopped cherries, and two stalks celery with 1 teaspoon cinnamon, \u00bc teaspoon nutmeg, and 2 Tablespoons brown sugar.   Next, I layered the sweet potatoes at the bottom of the slow cooker and lightly sprinkled them with some more cinnamon and brown sugar. I poured half of the first mixture over the potatoes.  Salt and pepper pork on both sides and lay atop the apple/onion/cherry/celery mixture in the slow cooker. I poured the remainder of the apple/onion/cherry/celery mixture on the top of the pork. Finally, I dumped about 1 cup of apple cider over  the contents of the slow cooker and cooked on low for about 6-7hours. This assembly took only 15minutes and I had an amazing, juicy dinner that was perfect with a huge hunk of challah bread from the local bakery to soak up the sweet/savory juice.  My mom was shocked that she had arrived at my house after a 6hour drive before me since I had work until 7pm, and at 7:30 I had such an awesome dinner on the table.",
