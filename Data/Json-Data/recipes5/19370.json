Instead of weighing the tomatoes, I used 12 cups of diced tomatoes, mostly because with less, the cup of vinegar I added to only 8 cups was way too vinegary for my taste. I used only one cup of brown sugar, left out the cayenne and added cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. I cooked it down for 2 hours and canned 3 pints. The leftover half pint tasted great on fresh bread. I'll be making lots of this - it's absolutely delicious!",

(This is my first time canning anything other than dilly beans) I simmered for at least two hours. Apparently that was not enough as it is still too thin. I thought maybe it would thicken up but it hasn't. (I guess that makes sense nothing really in it to thicken but just want to pass that on in case someone else thinks the same thing) I took it off the burner b/c it looked like all the tomatoes were cooked pretty much to nothing and I had the impression that it would stay chunky it did not. Also I wasn't sure if I was supposed to just slice up a whole lemon or peel it. I kept it whole. I used one lemon for the whole double batch and I think that was more than enough I can taste it clearly. Overall I liked it and will make it again except for boiling it down a lot more.",
