I followed some other reviewers and lessened the cracker crumbs to about 3/4 cup; we don't care for cooked green peppers, so I double up (or more) on the mushrooms and create the glaze to taste.  Yesterday I didn't have any saltines, but low fat Ritz worked just fine.  Also, I press into a loaf pan and then poke random holes in the meat to let excess glaze drip down into the loaf.  It really is quite a good recipe.",
