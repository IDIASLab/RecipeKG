Instead after marinating the meat or fish, boil the sauce you used to marinade and it will reduce nicely to a spicy kind of sticky BBQ sauce which freezes just fine. \n\nBTW the recipe makes enough for at least 2 meals if you're cooking for 2 so split it in half and freeze the rest. Works great on pork tenderloins and probably anything else you can think of. The London Broil idea was fantastic! We loved it!!! ",

Arawak BBQ sauce is also very forgiving marinade~ once this summer I added diet 7-up soda because nobody would drink it and there was only 1 cup left. The chicken still tasted good! The combination of spices and other ingredients gave chicken slightly sweet, light tang, mouth-watering taste with marvelous aroma! The aroma is almost thearptic. *Breath in, Breath out* :)",
