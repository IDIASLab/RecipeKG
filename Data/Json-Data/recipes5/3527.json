I was thrilled hoping he'd finally try and like salmon. He took one little bite and wouldn't eat anymore. I took a bite and understood why. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and we didn't eat it. I wrapped it up hoping to try to somehow fix all that expensive salmon so I can even eat it. I'm not sure if it was th combination of flavors but it DID taste fishy to me. Maybe the tomatoe sauce and ginger root? Think about it..tomato sauce and ginger root? I know alot of people like this recipe that's why I was so surprised. This is my first negative review. I would try a basic teriyaki marinade over this one. I use pineapple juice soy sauce brown surgar and garlic. Much better than this one and much easier to make. Sorry about the negative review.",

I've made it now with Salmon Chicken and even Tofu and it's perfect every time. The only changes I made were to use orange or mandarin marmalade instead of OJ concentrate leave out the tomato sauce entirely I use normal white onions in the sauce instead of green (and I put the ginger and garlic through a garlic press to help the flavours blend) and only use 1 tsp of olive oil in the sauce (more is not really needed and only adds additional fat/calories). I cook on my stovetop in a frying pan using the sauce instead of oil to cook it with. I remove the salmon chicken or tofu then cook a chopped onion chopped red bell pepper and 3 cups of baby spinach leaves with the remaining marinade and serve it together with rice. PERFECT! Will continue to make again and again.",

The only changes I made were to omit the tomato sauce (the first time I made it I used the tomato sauce the second time I didn't use it and I didn't notice a difference) and to use regular OJ rather than concentrated OJ. This dish is terrific with brown rice pilaf and green beans. Thanks for the great recipe!",
