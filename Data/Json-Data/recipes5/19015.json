I made a few changes for personal taste and lack of listed ingredients:  1 clove of minced garlic added to the olive oil instead of the garlic flavored oil; 10 drops of Tabasco instead of chili oil, but next time I'll add more; and more brown sugar - about two tablespoons - yum!  I used sugar snap peas fresh picked from my garden and they retained their crunch even when I ate the leftovers later.  This one's a keeper!",

Usually we just have them with ranch dip at parties etc. I wanted to serve this as a side dish veggie so here's what I did. I didn't have garlic flavored olive oil so I put the peas in a bowl drizzled them with some EVOO and mixed in a couple tsp. of minced garlic. Then I transferred this to a rimmed baking sheet that I had coated with cooking spray. I baked them at 400 for about 10-12 minutes just till slightly tender when pierced with a fork. I used 1/2 tsp. of both the sesame oil and brown sugar and omitted the chili oil (personal preference). They were great as a side dish for baked salmon. Thanks!",
