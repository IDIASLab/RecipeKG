I wondered about putting parmesean cheese in a sauce while it was heating but I followed directions and I was right it clumped up really bad. So the cheese and capers were all lumped together instead of uniform throughout the sauce. Clean up was a mess because everything the cheese touched had to be scrubbed to get it off. Thats why I gave it only 2 stars.",

Next time and there will be a next time I will use a skillet as this recipe does. This makes a lot more sauce and it is much tastier than te crockpot recipe. Both my husband and I liked this one.",
