Add a little bit of fat to the actual dough to make the fry bread tender- I used about 1-2 tsp. olive oil (not authentic, but oh well).  Also, instead of just a depression in the center, she always makes a small hole.  This allows it to cook evenly.  I fried in a mix of canola, olive, and coconut oil (ran out of canola).  I made 6 fry breads out of this recipe (some smaller than others).  I used my instant-read thermometer to measure the the temp of the oil.  These turned out perfect, and so yummy!  The topping was only 3 stars, at best- it's a little bit bland.  Next time I would just make my own thick chili to top these with.  I thought kneading the dough would be difficult, but it really wasn't.  It was a little sticky, but I only added a couple pinches of extra flour and it handled just fine- turned into a nice, silky dough.  I enjoyed making these!  I ate too many, and I don't make fried foods often (harldy at all) so I'll probably wait a little until I make them again, but I really enjoyed them!",

Everyone like the taco's that way for a change.  Yummy too for doing a dessert with the cinn/sugar/honey & also try it with ice cream.  **Update** I have made these several times per the resquest of my teens--the first few times I struggled a bit with the dough.  Hints to help make the dough easier to handle:  1) I scalded my milk before adding to flour mixture.  2) Make sure you knead it at least the 5 min. 3) Make sure your oil is a 365.  ",

I used a big sauce pot, filled it with oil and heated the oil to the temp the directions told. Only thing is when I fried my bread the whole house filled with smoke. By the time I fried my last piece my fire alarm was going off, then my security system went off, then the fire department came, then all the neighbors came out to see what was going on...and I'm just like 'what...I'm just making fry bread...'. After the smoke cleared we sat down at the dinner table and enjoyed a wonderful and yummy meal of fry bread tacos. Everyone LOVED them. I will for sure make it again, though, next time I will have to figure out a way of doing it without involving the fire department.",

They are easy, tasty and so chewy (I could go on & on!). I made these 2 days ago and used the bread like regular tacos(they fold in half nicely after they cool)and filled with regular taco meat and toppings.

It's necessary to make this as PAPER THIN as possible as they thicken up a lot.  I like to make this for company & use a little less than 1/2C so they're the perfect portion size.  I fry these about 2-3 min. on each side.  By the time you flip it, it shouldn't sink into the oil.  I also used a knife to pop any bubbles that formed so there would be a nice flat surface. You can make these ahead, and heat up in oven (temp 200) for guests or even microwave! I layer mine w/refried beans, then the ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, green/red/AND white onions diced, followed by cheese, salsa, sour cream.  This is truly the best and as mentioned, wonderful w/ice cream.",

If you aren't a big salsa fan (like my husband) try substituting a can of diced tomatoes and some fresh chopped onion garlic parsley and cilantro. I've also noticed several people noting that taco seasoning is too strong; I would suggest seasoning your beef (or ground bison if you can get it!) with salt pepper garlic and onion powder chili powder and paprika to taste. A great recipe and versatile; it reminds me strongly of the Indian Tacos I used to get at the great State Fair of Oklahoma as a child!",

                "reviewBody": "I have so enjoyed reading the reviews of this recipe, especially the lady whose smoke alarm went off, then her security alarm, then the fire department came...  At Native American gatherings, here on the West Coast, there will always be an \"Indian Taco\" booth, and one Indian Taco will fill you up, and then some!  Indian tacos usually start with a layer of refried beans on top of the fry bread, then a layer of crumbled ground beef, followed by the shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, diced onions, and then any topping of diced black olives, sour cream, guacamole, and picante sauce.  Just set out a table with all the fixings, and let your family/guests make their own, according to their likes/dislikes.  I add a hint of sugar to my frybread dough, and while I'm waiting for the oil to heat (seems to take forever!), I'm testing it every so often by dropping a tiny ball of dough into the oil.  If it sinks to the bottom and just lays there, your oil isn't hot enough.  Once it gets hot enough, you will probably need to turn it down a bit, or eventually your oil will turn black because it can be too hot as well.  I dedicate one large, cast-iron skillet as my frybread skillet, because it will get messy and is really hard to clean.  I cover and save the oil between batches, saving and reusing the oil as long as possible, even draining the oil and filtering it through coffee filters to re-use. Finally, frybread is terrific just as the bread for any soup or chili dish.",

(makes the bread lighter and fluffy).Tear the dough into 4 seperate pieces and roll them out pencil thin before deep frying. YUM!!",
