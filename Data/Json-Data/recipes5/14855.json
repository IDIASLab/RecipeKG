It only took me about 50 minutes to make everything: I started the split peas while the beef was browning I took out about a cup of the browned beef for the dumplings and started the meat sauce before I filled the dumplings I cooked the dumplings in simmering water for about a minute per batch. I served it with roasted vegetables: eggplant peppers and tomatoes tossed with chopped garlic and olive oil. Very tasty!",

I added finely chopped red peppers and green onions to the beef mixture for color and because I had them. I also had to use green peas instead of yellow based on what was available. I steamed the raviolis and also had some trouble with them sticking together. I might try brushing them with olive oil next time. I highly recommend this dish. If I could give it 6 stars I would! 2/9/15 update - I've made this many times now and while I love the recipe as written I've found that I prefer to use Basil in place of Mint. Just a personal preference but the whole family agrees. Also the instructions do not say to cover the split peas while cooking but I've found this is the only way to get the slurry texture. When not covered I was adding water every 5-10 minutes and just didn't get the right texture. Covering the pot solved this problem.",

I'd printed it out weeks ago and talked about making it--but my husband surprised me with the meal on Valentine's Day. He made it with lamb instead of beef which I think made it even better. He also made the pasta dough for the ravioli. It's such a gorgeous dish with its layers of different flavors and textures. I want one of us to make it again soon (and take a picture this time!). I guess it probably would serve four if you're not ravenous (or if you have a starter and a salad). But when I make a labor-intensive recipe like this I want it to last--so next time I'll double it.",
