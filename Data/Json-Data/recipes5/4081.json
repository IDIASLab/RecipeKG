This can be baked in the oven at 400 degrees 20 minutes I made this twice once on the grill too. Thanks I will use this again (:",

BTW: the recipe isn't written all that clearly: we melted butter added the lemon juice & wine to that butter mixed and then trickled over the fish before garlic powder (next time I'll use garlic SALT instead) freshly ground salt & pepper & parsley. I needed to use a lot more foil than was described--but it worked out quite well boiling brilliantly when I opened to check the fish at 15 min. My husband loved it; the kids ate all that was served to them; I thought it was OK but tasted more like FISH than flavor. Our fish had been defrosted from our freezer (bought fresh) so I'd try this again FRESH from the store (& with garlic salt or fresh garlic) b/c it was only that little edge away from a 4-star in my opinion. Easy.",
