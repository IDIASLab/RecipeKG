If you don't like coconut then I would skip this dish entirely, unless you like strong fishy taste.  When I first took this dish off the stove and took a taste the fish sauce overpowered everything.  Wasn't sure how this dish was going to turn out. Being so far into preparing this dish I went ahead and added the toasted coconut, cilantro, and lime juice and let refrigerate I ever night.  Wow what a difference a tasty light meal.  I followed the directions entirely as chief printed them.",
