You'll have enough aioli for a second sandwich; it will harden in the fridge due to the olive oil, but softens quickly. It really only lasts a day.",

I followed the recipe as is, scaled for one sandwich, and we didn\u2019t have eggs, so I made cheater aioli, using Mayo and doctoring it with the other ingredients (this was really good and even easier). The aioli really makes the sandwich, but I think I\u2019d like it ON the sandwich, as opposed to dipping it, perhaps slathering the inside of the bread with it ore frying. This may allow for some",
