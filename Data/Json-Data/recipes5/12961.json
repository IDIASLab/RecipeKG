It wasn't overly creamy as you would get from a store. This potato salad tastes even better the next day as the ingredients continue to meld together. Even my husband who is picky on potato salads loved this. Who ever knew potato salad was so easy to make? I added two stalks celery chopped just to add some extra crunch to the salad (see her if desired suggestions in recipe description). We'll never use store bought potato salad again. We've brought this potato salad as a potluck dish to share with our cabin neighbors (they do a guys trip) during an annual trip and this potato salad had 5 star reviews with comments of best potato salad they've ever had but don't repeat that to my mom or wife lol. Thanks for sharing the recipe Shorecook. Still making and loving it!",
