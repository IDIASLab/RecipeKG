Some tips: for best results don't overcook; cooks like a dream on Silpat baking sheets (well worth the investment) or a well-greased cookie sheet; they MUST cool for 5 minutes on the sheet--don't rush this! I highly recommend this recipe!!!",

These are great! I undercooked the first batch because they were too big but you know what? They were still good! I rolled one of the first batch up and dipped it in milk it was like some kind of heavenly candy bar! I may experiment with the cooking times on this recipe to see what I like best and I encourage you to do so as well. Also only use a full half tablespoon of ginger root if you are a big fan of ginger my husband still likes them but he said he'd use less ginger. I can't wait to serve some to my maritimer father-in-law tommorrow as he is a fan of molasses cookies and these are similar to the bakery recipe he likes so much. ADDED LATER: Oh my goodness! Definately use parchment paper to cook them! Easier to clean up and bakes them up so much lighter and fluffy. Still have the crunchy edges with the chewy middles. I deifinately give this recipe 6 stars with the parchment paper!",
