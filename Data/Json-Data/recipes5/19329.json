My small 2 lb elk roast took about 7 hours on high in order to shred and I had to add about a 1/2 c. water at the end to keep it moist. Be careful with the hot sauce!! The flavors really condense and a few drops made it pretty spicey. I served it on deli rolls toasted with mayo & parmesean a slice of provalone and some homemade cole slaw on top....Hubby LOVED it!",
