More like 15 for me and I only used about a fourth of a package! I took half a pound of bacon, cut them in half widthwise, and used half of those. I then decreased the amount of sugar. I also found it easier to coat the bacon slices in a ziploc bag. I highly recommend wrapping your baking sheet with aluminum foil because this gets so sticky and messy.Also, don't cool the bacon on paper towels because I found out the hard way that the bacon will stick to the paper. But in the end this tasted absolutely fantastic. It's very important to let the bacon cool a bit because it will crisp up more.",

Cut a few small slits in the foil on the top pan, so the grease drains to the bottom.",

I also cooked the bacon for 10 minutes at 400 instead of the recommended 375. After 5 minutes I turned the bacon over.  After cooking,I drained the bacon and then refrigerated (covered and on paper towels). The next day when company came, I zapped the bacon in the microwave to take the chill out.  Absolutely wonderful. Thank you",

                "reviewBody": "Oh my goodness this is sooo good... I tried this several different ways I love to experiment in the kitchen so I tried about eight pieces all different. Four I used brown sugar and four I decided to try dipped in honey. I tried the same things for both the honey and brown sugar: on one piece the cinnamon on the second piece was mustard powder as another reviewer suggested third was hot pepper (going for the sweet and spicy idea) and then the fourth was just the sugar/honey nothing else. The honey bacon was ok but not great had kind of a burnt flavor plus it didn't stick/caramelize as well as the brown sugar. The pieces that were plain and the ones with mustard and with hot pepper were all good but the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture was by far the best with the hot pepper coming in second. But you have to make sure you add enough cinnamon otherwise you won't taste it. You also have to cook the bacon long enough that the sugar starts to caramelize. One final note: I did mine with thick cut bacon. While this was good it did take a while to cook and didn't get as crispy as I would have liked. I know a lot of people are having trouble getting their bacon to cook because of the syrup consistency of the sugar...the cooling rack is a good idea as well as using a thinner cut bacon. Just make sure you cook it until dark brown. When you lift the bacon up you'll see strings where the sugar has almost hardened DELICIOUS!",

I cooked this at 400 as recommended on my package of bacon for 15 minutes and it was well done. I had trouble with the edges getting too crispy. Definitely use the foil as the sugar carmelizes and makes a really sticky mess on the pan. The bacon tended to get stuck at the edges and didn't want to release from the pan. I couldn't really tell the cinnamon was there because the sugar was strong. Very good Thanks!",
