Then yesterday I had an epiphany- Brownie Sundae! I topped these warm gingery, gooey delights with some french vanilla ice cream and warm roasted pears in pear caramel sauce. I topped with a few toasted walnuts and a dollop of whiskey whipped cream. Eye-rolling-toe-curling-oh-my-God good! 12/13/14 Im sitting here again eating one after another of these fabulous brownies. I can taste the butter, the brown sugar, the molasses etc... Every ingredient seems to be perfectly balanced with every other ingredient. Jozi is either a baking genius or very lucky because these are perfection. I am a shameless, unapologetic tweaker but my advice is to do these exactly as written the first time. You can always tweak them when you make them again. And you will make them again. I can almost guarantee it.",

Since my crew loves their ginger baked goods to have a pleasantly warm afterglow, I added a full tablespoon of ginger and several good shakes of cayenne pepper. Then sprinkled the top with sugar to ensure a crackly crust. These didn't disappoint. I'm perplexed by the reviews that call this recipe \"cake-like\" because mine were nice and chewy, with a thin, shiny crust that shattered when bitten into. To be fair, I need to note that I used only all purpose flour, as I didn't have any whole wheat. Maybe that made the difference? Another possible explanation I can think of is overbaking. They were devoured in no time flat, and one friend who is a major fan of gingersnaps said he actually prefers these because of their chewy texture - the flavor is virtually the same. These are easy to whip up in no time at all - much quicker than making individual cookies. I always keep molasses on hand, and this is just about as good an excuse as any I've found for continuing to do so. A+",

I baked mine for 35 minutes and have crispy edges and a soft interior.  Mine are very much the texture of brownies, not like a cake at all.  I read the reviews and added a sprinkling of cayenne and just a pinch of cloves.  Also sprinkled the top with some white sugar before baking, which gives a little sparkle to the top. One reviewer mentioned they were too salty...I wonder if that person may have used salted butter and also added the salt in the ingredient list.  I used unsalted butter. Also, be sure to sift your baking powder and soda into the flour.  Perhaps you tasted a little lump of baking soda.  Just guessing.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper!",
