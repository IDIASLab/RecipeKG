The frying changes the flavor profile so it's not as \"gamey.\"  As an extra bonus, I went ahead and used the other half of the tenderloin to make Chef John's \"baby\" porchetta, so we'll have dinner tomorrow or the next day.  I have nothing but respect for Chef John's recipes. They're easy to follow, require common ingredients, and the results are simply spectacular.  Please make this. You won't be disappointed.",
