        "description": "I've been trying for over a year to recreate a lobster bisque my son loved at a restaurant we went to in Maine, and I believe this is it!  Creamy texture with kind of a tanginess and a bit of a bite and lots of tender lobster bits.  And the nice thing about this recipe is that is actually quite nutrition-friendly.  High protein, but low fat using lower fat options for the ingredients (1 or 2% milk, fat free broth) and still tastes like you should feel guilty. Don't let the number of ingredients deter you, it's actually very easy to throw together.  Note about the cayenne pepper, a small increase or decrease makes a big difference in the amount of bite!  Start with the 1/4 teaspoon and go up to taste.  Serve with a salad and/or a crusty Italian or French bread.",

I made a few very slight changes, but I seriously doubt they made much difference.  Instead of all lobster, I used one lobster tail, several very large scallops cut into fourths, and about 4 very large shrimp, chopped.  I used 2 \u00bd cups fat free milk and 2 \u00bd cups half and half, and I used a nice drinking sherry, not cooking sherry.  The seafood and milk changes were simply because that is what I had on hand.  But, I never use cooking sherry, as it is so salty.  As it turned out, I did have to add some salt to the bisque, but at least I was able to control it.  So after all, the cooking sherry might work fine.  I served the bisque with a simple green salad and crusty bread.  My husband commented that it was wonderful, and wants me to make it for company soon!",

                "reviewBody": "This soup is delicious. I had scallops I had to use - so I guess I would call my version \"Scallops Bisgue\". The scallops were very large so I cut them in quarters. I used 2% milk - and it was fine. I also added 4 cloves of minced garlic. I didn't pay attention to the comment about the cayenne pepper - \"add to taste\". I just put it all in and wow - yes gives it a lot of kick - so be careful! It was actually very good though! I didn't have scallions - so I just did without but I think the scallions would have made it that much better. SO I will be making again and again and next will try with Lobster. BUT any seafood would be delicious. Its such a great base for a seafood bisque. Thanks for such wonderful recipe! UPDATE: made this again and this time used scallops and canned crabmeat. Forgot about the kick of the cayenne pepper and added it all. Next time I think I will leave the pepper out as 2 family members wouldn't eat it because of the spice. I figure you can add cayenne to your own taste but once its in there - its in there - so better off leaving out. This time I also tried with 4 Cups of Fat Free Milk and 1 Cup of half and half and didn't even notice that it was lower in fat!",

I actually was going to make it with just lobster shells (add to the simmering onions and let sit with the reduction until bright red) but tails were so cheap at 5.99 a piece I bought two and got more than enough for serious lobster flavor. First of all I sauteed with butter instead of olive oil I love butter and use it whenever I can. I used shallots instead of green onion and added minced garlic and white pepper in addition to the suggested spices. It turned out wonderfully and I served it to my family first; my father who doesn't care for lobster ate 3 bowls. I served the bisque in toasted sourdough rounds (breadbowls). I will absolutely make this again next time with crab I think!!!",
