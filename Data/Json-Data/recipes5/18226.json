I also used 7 habaneros w/ seeds and it has a nice heat to it that warms your whole mouth.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Very good, but maybe will modify the amount mustard the next time.  ***I just made another batch using only 1/8 cup mustard, 3 cloves garlic, dash of liquid smoke, 8 habs w/ seed.  I didn't pre cook peppers, I placed everything into the food processor and liquified, then cooked for about 10 minutes.  This is too die for!   I am baking fries right now to dip in it!

Sweet, hot, complex flavors, and just when you think everything is fine, those habaneros come strolling across your tongue in a sort of delayed reaction and make your hair stand up...  I made a double batch of this stuff, using just two tablespoons of yellow mustard, and added a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  Otherwise, followed the recipe. It was a nice fiery orange color when I had processed the habs and the peaches.  When I added in the molasses every thing turned a dark reddish brown... Sort of looks like BBQ sauce.  Still good, but I may try using light amber honey intead of molasses next time to keep that lovely orange glow.  It just seems like this sauce should be a nice red-orange color, to match the taste.  Regardless, this sauce is fantastic!  It gets better as it ages and mellows.  I will definately make this again, after I go through the two 24 oz. jars I made the first time!  (It is going fast...) I think I will try bottling some for gifts. ",

I just finished my second time making it. (made a double batch this time) The first time with all scotch bonnets(which for those of you who don't know, are about equivalent in heat to habeneros) and this time I made them with MOSTLY Bhut Ghost Peppers (which for those of you who don't know, is the second hottest pepper in the world). For anyone who does not want their sauce to be sweet, I HIGHLY recommend cutting the brown sugar AND the molasses in half. I substituted honey for the molasses the first time and it was fine. I also use peaches in LIGHT syrup to make the sauce less thick AND as a bonus it lowers the calorie count. With scotch bonnets I ended up using 15 peppers. With the Ghost peppers I ended up using 6. I also, per some reviews add a few cloves of garlic, some grated white onion, fresh thyme leaves, and a lime juice water mixture to my sauce to my tastes. Overall with these changes to my preferences, this recipe makes an AMAZING sauce that is great on ANYTHING. Start with half of the sweet ingredients and 3/4ths of the peppers and then add accordingly to your specific tastes. Stop adding peppers when the sauce is just a TAD bit milder than you like because the heat will increase a little as it ages in the fridge. Try it and you wont regret it.",

                "reviewBody": "First off this calls for WAAAYYYYY too much mustard. Even with only 3 Tbsp it's too much. And I am a mustard fan but WOW. Mustard and hot sauce serve 2 completely different flavor-purposes. Also too much cumin. The first time I made this it tasted like mustard-taco. However I really wanted to make it work because I love hot sauce so I made it again and cut out the cumin altogether and decreased the mustard down to the 3 tbsp I mentioned. Still too much mustard. However I am determined to use this as a base for a good fiery sauce. Next time I will use 1-2 tbsp of brown mustard dijon or spicy like Guldens or Grey Poupon instead of the regular yellow mustard I've used before. Also I used 12-14 habaneros WITH seeds and the heat was still less than tabasco or frank's. It was hotter in my belly than in my mouth. The flavor definitely gets better the longer it sits in the fridge. Also I have to admit that it's great with food that normally calls for mustard such as burgers. BTW I followed some other reviewers and used honey instead of molasses cilantro instead of coriander added garlic and even tried simmering it for awhile (which did help a little). Don't get me wrong it seems like it has serious potential but I can't believe it has upheld a 5-star rating as written.",
