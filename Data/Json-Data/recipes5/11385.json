Try different cheeses like pepper Jack or smoked Gouda for a change of pace. This works best with regular bacon, as thick-cut won't cook up as well. This recipe can easily be doubled.",

I had some chopped red and yellow bell peppers and onion so I sauteed them with a little garlic while the bacon was cooking in the oven. I had 8 strips of bacon so I mixed 7 eggs, 2 Tbl. fresh cream, salt and pepper. Placed the bacon, small spoon of pepper mixture, cheese, then egg mixture. Sprinkled a little dried thyme and a grind of pepper on top and baked per directions. So good, i'll make them again.",

Very good and versatile recipe. Did bake bacon a little before placing in cups-otherwise too flimsy to get to go around muffin cup. Feta cheese also good mixed in. Will make again!",
