Take a spike of lemongrass hammer it to release the flavor add to the oil and remember to strain it out in the end. 3. Fresh ginger works great also add to the oil and strain out in the end. 4. Use a Thai oil like peanut oil. You can skip the butter. 5. Spice the soup towards the end using your favorite Thai spices. I used tumeric paprika curry etc.) 6. When serving squeeze a few drops of lime juice and zest some lime peel (Keffir lime works amazing if you have access to a specialty produce store but regular limes will bring out a lot of flavor too). 7. Enjoy!",
