Used a specialty tomato called a Kumato which has brownish skin instead of red but very sweet. The shrimp salad was runny so I would try less lemon juice in the future. This is VERY mild a little light on flavor for us so I would try adding additional seasoning next time maybe Old Bay or a shot of hot sauce (could be personal taste preference). Enjoyed for lunch today.",
