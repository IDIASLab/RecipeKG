The second time instead of baking the salmon with the olive oil and using the citrus/balsamic mixture as a sauce I used it as a marinade and then baked the salmon and it was DELICIOUS:) Note- if using the sauce as marinade omit the cornstarch and use equal amounts OJ brown sugar and balsamic vinegar.
