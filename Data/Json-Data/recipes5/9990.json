The GMO garlic heads most people use are much larger because of genetic engineering than organic natural garlic. The rest of the recipe should stay the same. Other than using coconut oil instead of olive oil when you roast the garlic because we all know olive oil is ONLY a healthy oil when cold. NOT WHEN HEATED OR COOKED WITH. I also prefer my mashed potatoes with the skin left on (also healthier) so it makes the recipe much easier and healthier (Minus the crazy Carbs!)",
