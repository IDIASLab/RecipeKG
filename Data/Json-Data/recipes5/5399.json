I used about 1/2 lb of shrimp and adjusted the salt/powder to 1 TBSP each knowing it was still going to be too much and it was. I cannot imagine this as written. That being said assuming a typo and that it should be TEASPOONS not TABLEspoons this is excellent! I served it over pasta and it truly would have been inedible (because of the salt) had I not. If these were typos and the recipe is edited I'll happily adjust my rating.",
