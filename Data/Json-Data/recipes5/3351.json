I had to make a few changes but it still came out wonderful.\nI used Italian breadcrumbs instead of stuffing, light/reduced fat sour cream, garlic powder instead of salt.  I ommitted the butter and sprayed tops of chicken, once breaded,  with butter flavored Pam cooking spray.   I broiled the dish the last few minutes of baking to give it a golden brown color.  The changes definately cut down on the fat and makes for a healthier dish.  WOW, it was so so good.  The kids asked for seconds!!  They asked for me to make this every night!!\nThanks for the great recipe.",

I will only use Stove Top Chicken Flavor cause that turns out the best every time (dumped the package in a large ziploc and roll over with a rolling pin a few times, gives it just enough crush to cover chicken but still crunch!). There's something about the lemon juice, soy sauce & sour cream combo that seems perfect. I mix it up in a bowl and let the chicken sit in it for about 5 min. Is it possible that this tenderizes the meat some? Dunno, but its moist and tasty every time! I use garlic powder & celery salt, which seems to work for us without being too salty. The melted butter on top is essential as I found out. Hubby LOVES this & so does everyone I make it for. Serve with something green &    cranberry sauce and it feels like a holiday! Too good for words. Thanks so much!",

I also only cooked my chicken breast for 30 minutes and they were done perfectly.  Fifty minutes seems like a very long time to cook boneless chicken breasts.",
