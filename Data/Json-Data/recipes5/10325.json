When I sauted the all of the veggies with the sausage it came it out very flavorfull. This was a very flavorfull dish.. very good",

I used one large jalapeno pepper and took the others reviewers suggestion and doubled the orzo and the flavors were amazing. Came out so good even my picky eater cleaned his plate.

As my husband does not like spicy food I did not use spicy peppers and adjusted by using green and red bell peppers. I also used two whole chicken legs instead of that many thighs and chorizo for the sausage. I decreased the overall amount of meat and used a little more onion and peppers. The risotto technique is not necessary to achieve the same flavour results as you can also just toss in more of the broth in one go. I would recommend letting it sit there when almost done for at least 5-10 minutes. We prefer this dish the day after because the flavours have more time to infuse. Also doubles for a nice cold salad.",

Sorry...but the seasonings are what really made the dish and they are great. I liked having a lot of meat in it but I'm only feeding 2 - more pasta/rice is a definite budget stretcher.
