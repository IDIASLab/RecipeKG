Pierogi dough: beat 1 egg in 1/3 cup water add 2 cups flour and 1/2 tsp salt. Rest 10 minutes. Roll and cut into 3-inch squares. Flatten and fill a square with the mixture and then fold onto a triangle pressing edges firmly. Cook in boiling water 3 mins. then toss in pan of heated butter until slightly brown and crisp. My 7 yr-olds love it and I got spinach and corn in them. Yes!!! We had no leftovers for a family of 4 and I even had to make 2 doughs. Try it. Yumm. Thank you for the recipe.",

I used frozen chopped spinach, added more seasonings to the potato mixture, (garlic and onion powders and a little cayenne) and added parm cheese. I also sprinkled the top with more parm and some paprika. Once in my casserole dish, I placed it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to brown the top a little. Thanks again for a different way of serving mashed potatos!",
