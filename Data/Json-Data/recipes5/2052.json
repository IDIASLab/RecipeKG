We like this spread with 2 medium-size cloves, but if you have concerns or if you're using large cloves, start with less, the cheese's flavors will intensify overnight.  You always can add more garlic if it suits you.  ***12.20.18 UPDATE*** Instead of crackers, spread some cheese down the middle of a piece of salami, and roll up into a cone.  Nice for an appetizer tray or snack board.",
