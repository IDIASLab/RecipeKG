Your recipe is a very refreshing alternative for me. The fresh squeezed lemon was just right the Chili powder was unexpected and nobody guessed the seasoning that made it so perfect. No adjustments necessary the recipe is perfect just the way it's written. I will use this a lot. Already have plans to take it to a BBQ this week end.",
