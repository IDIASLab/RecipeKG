This recipe works great for 5 pounds of beef marinated overnight or at least 8 hours in the fridge. The sugar put a really nice crust/bark on my brisket. For exact cook time/temp you will need to Google for what type of meat you are cooking. Again I used beef brisket on the smoker and it was done it 8 hours. Plan ahead on this one and you will not be disappointed in the end result.",
