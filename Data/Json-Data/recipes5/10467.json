Layering the flavors intensifies the deliciousness (deglazing the pan with vinegar and wine). The consistency of the soup was perfect. I used balsamic vinegar and red wine in place of the sherry and asiago and gruyere in place of the sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack I used more thyme and a bay leaf in the stock. We had Caesar salad with it and a glass of Italian red wine.",

I generally like French Onion soup and order it in restaurants when they feature it so I can compare it to what I make.  Theirs seldom measures up. This one is very good, much easier to make and takes a lot less time than my my version.  I buttered both sides of the crouton up and toasted both sides up so that the crouton is extremely dried out then the cheeses Chef John suggested.  This allows the crouton to suck up as much of that delicious broth as possible.   It's heavenly comfort food. \nI think this recipe however should come with some sort of a disclaimer which Chef John should have included...  Please don't watch the video as you cook this recipe, I'm sure Chef John will not be responsible for any half eaten computer screens.",

The recipe\u2019s directions indicate that the total cooking time is 1 hour and 20 minutes.  However, the steps in the recipe indicate that the cooking time is over 2 hours.   \nThe bread can easily be browned in the oven after the onions are removed from the oven and placed on the stove top to cook.  I turned off the oven when I removed the onions and browned my bread in the oven when it was off.    \nThis is a mild tasting onion soup.  I prefer a more savory onion soup and added Worcestershire sauce and red wine to the finished soup.",
