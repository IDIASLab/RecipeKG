I have only made this recipe once so have not had the chance to try variations. As written however it is delicious. It impressed my guest who is a gourmand. I did not have corn flakes so crunched up corn chex which worked perfectly. My advice is have your guests hang out in the kitchen. When it comes out of the oven it is so beautifully tall and golden! I agree with others who said it could double as a dessert.",

It needs some spices (nutmeg and ginger maybe?) and one review suggested mashing the turnips. Maybe that would help too.
