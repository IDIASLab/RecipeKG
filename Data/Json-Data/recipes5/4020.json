Ironically dried mint (labeled as mint flakes in traditional grocery stores) works best - 1 or 2 tbsp. Also, for clarification, red onion not white onion. While lemon juice is typically used in this dish in northern Iran, try it southern style with lime juice instead. It adds a little more zing. We usually use at least one (if not two) freshly squeezed lemon/lime; 1 tbsp is too little.  Finally, let the salad refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to blend the flavors. This salad makes a great accompaniment to Middle Eastern dishes such as kabob, kofta, falafel, donair, etc, but also try it with steak or carne asada. Yum.",

I decided for the purpose of what I intended this salad for that it would be easier to eat and prettier to boot if it wasn't all chopped up. I used fresh crisp baby cucumbers sliced and tiny grape tomatoes. Since I m having dinner guests tonight and not familiar with their tastes I played it safe and left out the onion. Finally with just salt and a little lemon juice I knew this would be rather flat and lifeless in my view. I had some homemade lemon-dill vinaigrette left over which worked ideally with the addition of even more dill. The salad now is delicious - light fresh and nicely enhanced with the dill lemon juice olive oil salt pepper and Dijon mustard in the vinaigrette. I m sure my guests will love it. I suppose my alterations effectively changed the authenticity of this salad (one I m not familiar with) but I was quite pleased to use the recipe as a base reference for my own tweaks. As is however I can t rate it any more than average as it lacks any real character or flavor distinction.",
