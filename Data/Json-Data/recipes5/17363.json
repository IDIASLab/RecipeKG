I did do as so many others suggested and upped the amount of both the pb and the banana to 3/4 cup. I did think about adding more flour but no reviews had mentioned that so went ahead and baked the first batch. They turned out kind of flat and mushy so added about 1/4 cup or less to the rest of the batter and the remaining muffins turned out great. The daycare kids didn't care for the texture the oatmeal gives the muffin so will probably leave that out and add more flour in the future...maybe ww flour? These were even better the next day. Oh almost forgot! I lightly drizzled these with a thin chocolate glaze (powdered sugar cocoa and milk)instead of making the topping...really added to the muffin.",
