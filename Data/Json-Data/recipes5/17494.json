(Sadly, I can only assume it tasted wonderful because everyone raved about how good it was... but by the time I finished in the kitchen and got my plate - it was already gone, so I only got a few little scraps!)  For ease of preparation, I fixed a fruit salad with it, and used the drained juice from the canned pineapple, and substituted 1/3 cup of orange juice because I forgot to buy an orange.  It was much easier to make than other recipes I have used - yet tasted like it had taken a ton of effort.  I normally use more complex recipes from the major cooking magazines that can require dozens of spices and ingredients, as I love to experiment with flavors and love gourmet food, so I was leary of how simple this was... but with a very limited budget and limited prep time for this party, I decided to try this one - and was VERY pleased.  It looked delicious on the table, and it was the first to disappear on the buffet - I will be throwing away my other ham recipes, and sticking with this one.",

It also said to cover the ham with foil, so I covered it with foil ONLY for 1st  hour but I won't be doing that again because the outside of the ham started to get crispy too soon, so next time I'll cover the ham in the last 35mins of baking instead. Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated and was quite satisfied with the results. I think I'm going to add 1 1/2 - 2cups of water inside the roasting pan because that water gets the ham moist and it serves as a \"dip\" when you glaze the ham. Any glaze that falls down to the bottom of the pan, falls into that water and it is delicious! Once the ham is done and you are ready to serve the ham slices, dip the slices of ham into that glazed water mixture at the bottom of the pan. It makes the ham so moist and you get to taste the glaze a bit more.",

Placed the ham cut side down in a heavy disposable roasting pan with 1/2 bottle of Honey Brown Ale. Studded the ham with whole cloves vs using ground in glaze. Used 1/4 C real maple syrup vs honey & reduced brn sugar by 1/4C. I used orange juice (I had orange zest on hand) & reduced glaze down a bit longer. I heavily brushed glaze on initially prior to my tradition of toothpicking fresh pineapple rings on. Loosely tented ham w/foil for 1st 2 hours @300 degrees. Uncovered, then 'spooned' glaze on every 15 minutes for another hour at 325. The BEST ham and my company thought it was DELICIOUS! Moist, tender and using an electric knife makes slicing a breeze. Spiral sliced ham won't be going in my cart again, LOL. I didn't deviate too much from recipe and it's so easy. Tip: You can bake ham earlier in day, let it rest (loosely covered) for 30 minutes. At this point I slice & pile on oven safe platter, spoon on some drippings, cover tightly and re-heat about 15 minutes before serving. Makes my life in the kitchen easier with the sides, etc. needing the oven space...just a mention :)",
