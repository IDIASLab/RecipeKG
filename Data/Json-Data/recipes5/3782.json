I cut this in half for just my boys and I used my Pampered Chef hand chopper to get the trail mix and carrots chopped really fine. I did add a tbsp. of honey to make it a little easier to spread and to give it just a touch of sweetness. My kids loved it. I'd so make this again. I think I might make this into stuffed french toast next time! Imagine how good that would be! EDITED: Yes. This makes good stuffed french toast.",

This recipe was made for \"going on adventures\" but my adventure was only to the kitchen so I ended up toasting it. This helped warm the cream cheese. Because of the added cinnamon this sandwich reminded me of eating a Cinnamon raisin bagel. You don't really taste the lemon juice or carrots but they help give an extra crunch.

While nothing you would find in a restuarant we always take this camping or hiking with us. It is a great change from traditional sandwiches. I use trail mix with fruit. When we go camping I make the mix store it in tupperware and keep it in the icebox until the day we are going to use it. Then I just spread it on the bagels. When we go hiking I wrap it good in saran wrap and foil. This sandwich doesn't get squished either in between the rest of our hiking stuff - so it is great for that reason too!

When I first tried this I thought something was missing I double checked the recipe and found I forgot the lemon juice! The lemon juice makes everything come together it tasted a million times better after I added the lemon. I didn't use the full 8oz of cream cheese I used maybe 5-6oz and thought it was just enough. I also finely grated my carrot but next time ill use a bigger grater because I think bigger shreds of the carrots would have been better. I don't know if ill make this all the time but I will make it again! Thanks for sharing",
