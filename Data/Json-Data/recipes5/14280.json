The recipe says 1 pound of ground beef but the photo shows beef chunks or stew beef so I got a pound of stew beef. The recipe also didn't say any veggies for this it just did red potatoes I did carrots that were already in my fridge and packaged and then I also added 2 celery sticks and some mushrooms. Also there was a photo of this recipe that showed carrots in it but it was not listed on the recipe. For seasoning I found the beef broth and water wasn't enough for flavor so I added season salt Worcestershire sauce some red wine some more onion already chopped and minced minced garlic these beef seasoning cubes forget what their called dried thyme and 2 bay leaves. It turned out great! Lots of flavor and the whole family enjoyed it.",
