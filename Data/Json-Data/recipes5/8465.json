I guess the starch in the rice helps to thicken the soup but there wasn't any noticeable thickness. I didn't waste the rice though I tranferred it to another pan cooked it in more water and mixed it with some instant vanilla pudding to make a mock rice pudding. I think I may try strawberries next time because the raspberry seeds are hard to eat.",

The only changes I will make next time will be to give the cherries a rough chop so they aren't too big and maybe use more rice or simmer it for longer to get the soup to thicken up a bit more. Don't throw away the rice just save it to eat for breakfast with some butter and a little extra cinnamon.",
