That filled out the flavor and added a tiny bit of heat. I let the dressing sit overnight. It would be helpful to know if the cashews were raw or roasted and salted. I used raw cashews in the dressing and then added 1/2 tsp of salt. For the salad itself I roasted the remaining 1/2 cup cashews in the oven for 5-10 minutes (watch them carefully) and chopped them once cooled. Next time I will roast all of the nuts. Overall this was a good change up on the standard spinach strawberry salad. Thanks for posting caramommy!",
