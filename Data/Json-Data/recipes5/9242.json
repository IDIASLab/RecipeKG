It's great!\nBrush the apple mixture, then wrap with bacon, but save the final brushing of the apple mixture for the last ten minutes of cooking, otherwise the sugars will darken too much.   I used applesauce, didn't have apple butter.\nThis goes well with a side dish of fried apples and onions. Core and slice thin an apple or two, mix varieties if you can. Slice an onion or two. Save a piece of fatty bacon, fry it up, then fry the apples and onions in the remaining bacon fat. Add a half teaspoon (total) of your favorite blend of allspice, clove, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg. If you like things sweet, drizzle a teaspoon or two of honey or maple syrup at the last minute or two of frying.",

I had 2 smaller tenderloin pieces that were 3lbs together, but they were partially frozen still, so time to cook was longer than recipe stated (but understandable).  The flavour was fabulous! I didn't have maple bacon, but the apple butter and honey were very thick, so I added some pure maple syrup to the glaze which gave a nice hit of maple flavour.  Will definitely do this one again!",

Also, I am using pre-cooked bacon this time (another user suggestion).  The taste the first night is fabulous, but the flavor when you heat up the leftovers (if there are any) is amazing!  Oh, I did not cook on 325 degrees.  My tenderloin had cooking directions of 425 for 25-30 minutes.  I believe that the original author of this recipe might have meant that, because at 425 degrees for 27 minutes my pork is perfect temp and texture.  Making this a fantastic week night quick fix.",
