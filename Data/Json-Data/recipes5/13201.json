I loved the soup, so when I got home I recreated it. It is incredibly simple to make, and incredibly delicious. I would also like to mention that it's best served with a dense bread to dip into the soup. I find olive bread or a spicy bread compliments well.",

I couldn't fine Wakame seaweed so I soaked two sheets of Kombu (not Nori) then diced it. I increased the garlic by 1 clove because I love garlic. Last I increased the soy sauce to 1 tablespoon. Be sure to completely open the cans of coconut milk and scrape out the sediment on the bottom or you will lose a lot of flavor. I can't say how wonderfully rich the mushroom flavor was with just simple button mushrooms. I will make this again and again thank you so much!",
