It is brought to our neighborhood chili tasting each year and is the first one gone every year! Serve topped with green onions, cilantro, and shredded Cheddar cheese, if desired.",

I didn't have cannelini beans so I substituted pinto beans instead and it worked out just fine. I didn't have Rotel so I put in a jar of mild salsa and it worked out just fine as well. Used cream style corn instead and again, it worked out just fine. Also, I didn't have a packet of ranch dressing mix so I used about 1/2 a cup or more of ranch dressing already made. The soup tasted great.",
