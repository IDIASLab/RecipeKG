I started at 10:30am - including the first 1.5 hour on high - and turned to low shortly after noon. It still took until almost 4pm before it was ready. Followed exactly- including the confusing ingredient of butter? This was ok-good; and with all the peppers, corn, etc - we didn\u2019t find too watery, just never thickened like a chowder that we were expecting. Husband said could take it or leave it.  Worth trying - thank you!",
