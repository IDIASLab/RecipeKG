I also added 1 can of drained corn kernels about 1 hour to 30 minutes before serving to get a vegetable in the meal. I also found that if you have less than 5-6 hours for preparation you can butterfly the chicken breasts and they will be done in only 3 hours. A new favorite for me!",

I eat 1.5 pounds of chicken a day, and cooking it gets REALLLLYYY OLD, realllyyy fast. So I literally tossed 6 pounds in the slow cooker, adjusted the rest and went to bed, came back at 7 am with days worth of delicious food.\n3. It adds so much flavor to the chicken us body builders usually miss out on because we are so restricted...\n\nI freaking love this, idk if I'll ever cook chicken another way.",
