It was stringy and had a bitter taste from all the parmesean cheese and there was a fair amount of \"left over\" cream in the bowl that was not absorbed. IF I make it again I would chop the mushrooms first and either use a different creamier cheese or 1/2 the amount of parmesean. My family ate it but were not bowled over--even with bacon in it. The sticky mess it made in my pan and on my dishes was not worth the results.:(",
