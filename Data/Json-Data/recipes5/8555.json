I think I could serve it to regular everyday people (not just \"health-food nuts\") without issue. I did have to double up on the cocoa because I am a dark-chocolate aficionado, and I might be inclined to reduce the maple syrup for more bitterness. I wish I had poured the pudding directly into serving dishes for a nicer presentation. Thank you Valorie for sharing your recipe.",
