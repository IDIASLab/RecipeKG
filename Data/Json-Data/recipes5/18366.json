TIPS: Definately use foil on your pans when baking. Cook for first 25 minutes at 325 and the last 15 minutes at 350. Use center cut, thin sliced bacon and cut in half. Less fat and no need for toothpicks. Also if putting in a slow cooker to keep warm, pour a half a cup (or so) of maple syrup in the cooker to help keep them moist. EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!",

To ease in preparation, I prepared all of these the week before and froze them individually on cookie sheets. After they were frozen I put them into freezer bags and stored them until I needed them. I took them straight from the freezer and put them on a cookie sheet, sprinkled with brown sugar and cooked them at 400o for about 30 minutes. They came out wonderfully and I will be making this recipe again! I still have some bacon wrapped smokies in the freezer!",

I put the brown sugar and little sausages in a gallon sized zip lock bag, then shook it. I also used maple flavored bacon instead of the regular (let me tell you it brings more to the recipe! A definate must try!). Instead of using foil I put a cooling rack on the baking tray and sprayed it with non stick cooking spray so that the bacon won't stick to it and placed them on there, and I lined the tray with foil for easy clean up. It came out nice and crisp all over when it was done. I baked it at 400Deg. F for 40-45 minutes and they came out nice and crisp. With Super Bowl Sunday coming up this will be the perfect bite sized snack for the fellas!",

Just whack your pound of bacon into thirds, wrap a piece around a smokie and stick a toothpick through it. I don't measure the brown sugar, just dump it on.

Rich, greasy and sweet.  I get a little queasy just thinking about them.  (If I were to make these again - and I won't - I would shave a few minutes off the cooking time as the bacon was a tad overdone)",
