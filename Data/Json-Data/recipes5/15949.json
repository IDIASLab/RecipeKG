As other reviewers have noted, the recipe doesn\u2019t specify what to do with the chicken. It works well to cut it into small cubes and throw it in the crockpot raw, along with the other ingredients. Make sure you drain the corn and the beans. Then cook everything in the crockpot on low for about 6 hours. There are several good cornbread recipes in this site that go well with it.",
