I don't keep pico on hand and I wanted something quick so this is how I would do it if I ever did it again just for logistical reasons but I bet it would be better with the fresher ingredients. I thought it looked a little soggy so I added maybe 2 ounces of cream cheese. For ease in prep I just mixed the shredded cheese in with the rest of the filling. I used jalapeno cheddar wraps and I think they were 10 or 12 inches so I only had enough filling for 4. As an appetizer roll up they were good but not outstanding. I did try one roll up with ham (ran out of turkey) and didn't like it nearly as well. You have to choose your deli meat carefully with this because you don't want anything sweet or super smoky.",
