I\u2019m the submitter of this recipe, I live in Florida which has a large Cuban population and MANY Cuban restaurants.  Although your way may be a \u201ctraditional\u201d way, it\u2019s not the only way to prepare Cuban black  beans.  There are many different styles of black beans home cooked in kitchens and restaurants (offering an option of white or yellow rice) throughout Florida as well as the rest of the U.S., and this recipe just incorporates some of those ingredients.  Just \u201cGoogle\u201d Cuban Black Beans or do a search on Pinterest, and you\u2019ll see what I mean.  And that\u2019s not to say there\u2019s anything wrong with the traditional way, but there\u2019s also nothing wrong with updating a traditional recipe which some call \u201cbland,\u201d to make it more interesting.",

One of my favorite local Cuban restaurants offers a scrumptious vaca frita and I always choose yellow rice and black beans as well as sliced fresh tomatoes as sides. This recipe made the beans taste very much like those at the restaurant. I used Sazon for the first time and liked it but found the measure increment in the recipe quite confusing. The package I purchased has a total weight of 1 ounces but there are multiple packets within and the manufacturer recommendation is one packet per four servings. This time the beans accompanied a pork loin and rice; next time perhaps I'll be bold and attempt vaca frita!",
