I followed the instructions exactly (after I scaled it down by exactly 1/2) and there were a couple problems with it.  1) The soy sauce was overpowering.  I recommend using a light or low sodium soy sauce or diluting regular soy sauce with equal part water.  2) The peanut butter taste is almost non-existent.  I recommend that the peanut butter be doubled to get a good flavor.",
