The chicken turned out perfectly and after stirring the liquid with the shredded chicken for a few minutes everything came together nicely. When serving I topped the chicken with some fresh Pico de Gallo and that made the flavors really pop. Otherwise it would have been a bit too creamy for my liking. Delicious dinner and would make again!",
