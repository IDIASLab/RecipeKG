From what I remember, red beans and rice were always made at home on Mondays using leftover pork bones from the weekend meals. It's deliciously flavorful and can be made as spicy as you'd like. I hope you love it as much as my own family does.",

Instead of pork neck bones and bacon, we substituted 1 link of sliced Cajun sausage (we always buy Hot) and 1 link of sliced and quartered chicken  and green onion sausage (ham bone would have been good here as well). We would never cook rice in our red beans, so we did that on the side (not everyone wants the same amount of rice). We then doubled the whole recipe and it was delicious! We did not find it too spicy at all - just right. Not too much cayenne, but if you're sensitive to spicy foods, you can cut the cayenne, use mild sausage and let whoever's eating add their own spice. Good recipe! Aiyeeee!",
