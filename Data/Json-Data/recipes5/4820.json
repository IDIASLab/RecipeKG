This was my first time using coriander and I was surprised what a nice faint flavor it adds. I made this according to the recipe first and thought it was great. Then I added tomatoes feta and more lemon and basil for a nicer presentation. See my before and after photos. Next time I will cut thicker than 1/4 inch because it doesn't hold its shape very well when cut so thin. I will also peel the eggplant as I'm not a fan of the skin but that's just preference. My eggplant stuck to the pan a little despite the olive oil coating so I would recommend spraying your pan lightly with cooking spray. Overall a tasty and easy recipe that I would make again.",
