He cooked all the fish by itself first and then added it to the base, I prefer a fish be pan seared or broiled rather than boiled. He makes his own fish stock and used a mixture of fresh and canned tomatoes. Heavily seasoned and fresh herb from our garden. Served with slightly chilled Pinot Noir, greens with homemade croutons, balsamic and Lovie & Co. spice blend  seasoning. Topped off with fresh garlic seasoned homemade crusty bread.
