I think it turned out great.  It's even better the next day.",

My husband loved it. It was really interesting because the noodles didn't seem like noodles, yet they provided a nice, starchy texture like what you'd expect in a casserole like this. I wonder what potatoes would be like? I would even consider leaving the chicken out next time and serving as a side dish. Also, as weird as it may sound to others, I think this would be absolutely delightful with green peas mixed in, so I may try that. I'll definitely be making this again.",

I lost my original account due to marrying and changing my old email. :( If you like spicy try my \"different chicken divan\" with rice and use 1 TBS Curry only.  For this recipe, I said use a LG sour cream. In my mind that is the Mayfields LG container. So if you don't use that size, it will be dryer. The Large container of Sour Cream mentioned means Mayfield's brand Large. It is 1 lb 8 oz. (or 680G)  Now I have to buy more SCs to make it as big as Mayfields brand, which is not available in my current area. Hope this helps! It IS super creamy! Anyone who did not like it either did it wrong or just didn't like it. I always use SWEET ONIONS. I never precook noodles as it makes mush. I do cover it for the first half of cooking, did I remember to say that??? It was a few yrs ago that I posted this. This has great flavour if done correctly. People will fight over who ate the last bowl!",
