Used chicken breasts instead. Put the chicken in a iron skillet and a bit of chicken broth to brown each side then added the potatoes and herbs/lemon mixture. Low heat for about half an hour. Turned out great with plenty of leftovers. Will be using this while camping in the summer/fall season. Two thumbs up!",
