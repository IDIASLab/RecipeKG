The only thing I changed was I added a layer of refried beans mixed with salsa and a layer of reduced fat mexican cheese blend. So it went tortilla, refried bean mix, riccotta cheese mix, meat, sprinkle cheese. Then on the very top I put another layer of riccotta and then sprinkled the cheese. I served it with fat free tortilla chips and corn. My husband hates beans and mexican but he cleaned his plate.  He couldn't figure out what the bean layer was - he just liked the creamy taste - Great recipe",

This is the 3rd time I've made it now and this is how we've decided we like it best: 2 10 inch tortillas & then 1 halved tortilla on each side (straight side to the edge of the pan).  \n\nHalf the meat mixture (2 lb ground turkey, diced yellow onion, taco seasoning, 1 14.5 can diced tomatoes & 1 can rotele), 2 cups shredded monterey/colby.  Another layer of tortillas.  Next is the ricotta with 1 egg and 1 4 oz can chilies whipped together and a can of corn over the top.  Another layer of tortillas.  Rest of meat with 2 small cans sliced black olives.  Another layer of tortillas.  8 oz sour cream + 8 oz salsa mixed over the top of that, topped with 2 cups of mexi-cheese and sliced green onions on top.  Bake as directed.  This makes enough to feed myself and 3 growing boys with plenty to take into work to share.  Thanks so much for the ideas and the recipe!",

I did change a few things though I used corn tortillas instead of flour I decreased the water to about 1/2 cup and I added pepper chili powder and some other spices to the ricotta. I also added cheese (a combination of cheddar and monterey jack) to the layers and on top. Very yummy!! This made enough for 3 meals for my family so I froze the extra helpings.",

Also a good recipe to use up leftovers--you can add pinto or black beans sweet corn or extra salsa--it's a very forgiving dish",

I covered this with foil for most of the bake time, uncovering the last 10 mins...Mmmm!  Wonderful!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!! :)",

First, if you're using flour tortillas, take the time while prepping the other ingredients to toast the tortillas just for a few minutes. I always make enough for leftovers the next day and this seemed to be a good solution for the sogginess. I added black beans to the meat mixture and only drained them a little so i didn't need the 2 cups of water after that. I usually cut the taco seasoning to only 1/2 a packet. I usually don't keep green chili peppers on hand so i substitute chopped green onion or fresh chives. Only 4 stars, since there were modifications but still a keeper. Delish!",
