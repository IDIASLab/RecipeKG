Like others suggested I toasted the almond slices and used less lemon (no zest but I squeezed half a lemon). The end result was phenomenal. The almonds gave the broccoli a woodsy flavor and a nice crunch. Thank you!",

I measured nothing just added butter lemon juice and toasted sliced almonds to accomodate my taste - and skipped the lemon zest altogether. I think it would have been lemon overkill otherwise. To preserve their crunch I added the toasted almonds just before serving which also proved to be a pretty garnish.",

It was a tad sour but I did like it when it just lightly covered the broccoli the rest of my family ate it but didn't enjoy it.",
