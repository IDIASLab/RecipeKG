Only problem I had was that I only had access to non-natural skippy type peanut butter,so when I boiled the ingredients, the oil separated from the rest of the mix. I needed to whisk the oil back in, as no amount of spoon stiring helped. I don't know if anyone else had this problem when using natural peanut butter.I also plan on using the leftovers to make a cold thai pasta salad that has penne, apple chunks, ginger(already in satay sauce), chicken chunks, green onions and small bits of brocoli just like I used to buy at my favorite cafe diner.",

If the recipe is too bland for your taste, increase the heat with a hot sauce, cayenne, more red pepper flakes or whatever you want.  I put lots of ginger in mine.  I don't even measure how much.  I estimate a tablespoon or more.  If the recipe is not peanutty enough, add more peanut butter.  As long as it has the coconut milk and the peanut butter it is an extremely flexible recipe.  In addition to lots of ginger, this recipe is served well by generous garlic as well.  I serve this over chicken skewers marinated in an improvised teriyaki sauce with the red chili sauce (not rooster sauce) with rice and edamame.  A perfect, easy and reliable meal.",
