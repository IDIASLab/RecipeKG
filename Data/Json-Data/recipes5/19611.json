I'm not sure if that is because of the reduced sodium choice or not. But i would rather make it this way and just add a bit of soy sauce after. Thank you for sharing!!! Edit! Added a picture of my most recent making it again. Very yummy! I haven't been skimming off the oil nor trimming the fat off the short ribs before cooking. The rib bones afterwards go to dogs and my cat loves the fat and bits around the bone we couldnt chew off. Also i increased the reduced sodium soy sauce water and sugar this last time since i used a bigger pot it didnt cover the meat much at all. It was just fine =)",
