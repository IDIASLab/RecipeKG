Second time I browned pork in pan, finished 20 mins on grill over indirect heat. (could put on broiler pan in oven) Made sauce in pan. Great!  Also, I reduced black olive tapenade to 1/3 cup & increased blue cheese to 1/2 cup the 2nd time. More balanced flavor. (That was for one tenderloin.) Also, be careful not to get too much of the oil the tapenade is in when filling. Over all a very good & easy recipe.",
