If this recipe looks good to you but you don\u2019t like fishy tasting fish just make these small changes. Either make sure you are using DOVER SOLE (only sole that is not fishy!) or use Orange Roughy. Or just any white fish that is extremely mild. And to make the sauce double the lemon juice mixture and use half for cooking the fish and the other half for making the sauce. Then the sauce is excellent (on lots of things) and there is no fishy tasting anything!!!! You can also replace the shrimp for crab if you choose. ",
