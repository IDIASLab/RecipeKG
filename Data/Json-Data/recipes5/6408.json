        "description": "This recipe uses cultured coconut milk as a substitution for buttermilk and mayonnaise in a dill-flavored, creamy salad dressing. Enjoy! I found an alternative to dairy-based yogurt. Cultured coconut milk is not as thick as yogurt, but it works as a sub for buttermilk and mayonnaise in a traditional ranch-style salad dressing or dip. It's not a perfect sub, but for anyone who is avoiding dairy, it's worth a try. Look for this product in the yogurt section of your grocer. It's also great in smoothies!",

I'm not lactose intolerant or have any issues with dairy and still loved this. It is a nice change to a usual dressing without additives or useless fats! This can definitely be used in place of any ranch or buttermilk dressing. Thank you Bibi!! Update: I added 2 tsp of dried coconut pulp (leftover from making coconut milk) and that thickened this up a bit without giving it any coconut flavour!!  :-)",
