Follow the recipe as written after that.  Whisking a lot and making sure that your sugar is fresh and not clumpy will make it smooth.",

This is a new family favorite a can't-live-without kind of recipe. Who would think it was this simple? I agree with Amy on technique of blending ingredients well and slowly - never underestimate how much better that can make your recipes. I started by blending the flour and brown sugar together in my sauce pan NOT over heat blended it very thoroughly and taking care to break apart any clumps. THEN I heated it while stirring and added the milk a little bit at a time and stirred constantly while adding the milk until it was well blended and smooth. After it boils it will look lumpy (don't panic!) just keep stirring.... this is now a family favorite!",

This is a somewhat thin pudding and very good as is in dessert cups.  The directions would be better if you mix sugar/flour together first and slowly whisk in half the milk before you turn on the heat.  Then whisk in rest of the milk until it boils.  Add some of the hot pudding to the egg yolks and then stir in.  This will make a very smooth pudding.",
