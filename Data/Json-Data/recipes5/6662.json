I only added a pinch of the sugar and thought it needed something so added a dash of Tabasco. I think tomorrow I'll hardboil some eggs and add one to the 1/2 batch I made for him. I agree with lutzflcat in that homemade dressings are so easy and so much better than store-bought ones! Every once in a while I'll buy one for my husband but we always go back to the homemade ones!
