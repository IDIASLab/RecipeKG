Definitely needs lemon zest otherwise tastes just of cool whip and the sweetened condensed milk. I used the zest of two and 1/2 lemons. Use a micrograter to zest and it's a snap. Also zested 1/2 of a lemon to put on top for decoration along with a lemon twist. Definitely do not be tempted to put more cool whip on top as a topping. Not needed at all. This is of course not cooking. Just putting things together. Great when you need to take a dessert somewhere. Can make it in the morning in about five minutes time ready to take by evening. With the addition of the zest my pie was lemony. Would make again trying some kind of pie filling without the condensed milk added.",

                "reviewBody": "As written this tastes like Cool Whip with a light lemon scent (and even lighter flavor). Perhaps by \"lemon juice\" what she meant to say what \"lemonade concentrate\"--I've had several similar recipes using (thawed) frozen lemonade concentrate from a can cool whip & sweetened condensed milk with great success. This one despite using double the fresh lemon juice wasn't lemony (and I used only 8 oz. of Cool Whip as it no longer sells in 12 oz. standard here.) It was easy enough to adjust so I'm not going to knock this recipe down below 4 stars because everyone should have bottled lemon lime or orange juice in the fridge to adjust to taste. And everyone's tastes are different! Adding the extra lemon juice made my filling a bit runny so I'm going to serve this as a freezer pie which will be also super delicious and refreshing. Thanks for the recipe:)",
