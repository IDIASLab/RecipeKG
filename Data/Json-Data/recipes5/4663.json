I followed it exactly won't change a thing in the future. Please heed Heather's advice to let it set overnight (I served mine too soon - but nearly polished it off the next day!). Not only does the flavor deepen but it thickens up. P.S. I used water packed fresh feta and will make this with Greek yogurt next time for an even creamier consistency. Thanks Heather I finally have a great tasting dip I don't have to feel guilty about!",
