Instead of a garlic clove, I sauteed about 1/2 tsp or so of minced jarred garlice and I used a 1/2 stick of butter rather than just the cooking spray, and I added 2 cups of chicken stock/broth rather than 3/4 cup (I was cooking 6 pieces of boneless chicken breast). I also squeezed in the juice of a 1/2 lemon (we like lemon), using the pampered chef lemon citrus squeezer. Then I thickened it just a bit with some corn starch.  Truly tasty! (By the way someone needs to replace that truly terrible picture of raw-looking chicken for this recipe.)",

I don't spray my skillet so I used a little lemon olive oil for the \"browning.\" The broth I used was from the bones from a chicken I roasted using Roasted Chicken Rub by Semigourmet from this site so it did have quite a bit of flavor to it to begin with. I usually also use Papa's Seasoning also from this site as my salt and pepper. So all in all I did follow the recipe in my mind! I almost cooked out all the broth/lemon juice at the end and I would have liked a little more if I'd have used vermicelli as suggested by the submitter of the recipe. This is a simple but tasty meal easily done in a short time! I'll do this one again but I may just have to add a little butter to the broth in the final steps! Thanks Karina Mitchell!",
