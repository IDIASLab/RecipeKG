The tomatoes and broth yield plenty of juice so if you do not rinse and drain the beans and corn then you end up with soup and not stew. Rule of thumb...always rinse black beans. They will muddle up and give an unpleasant color to anything you are fixing if you do not. As far as the rest of it goes, drain the rest of your beans and corn if you want stew...leave some of their juices if you want soup.",

I had to transfer it to a my large stew pot to finish adding the beans. The volume of the ingredients adds up to over 5 quarts so unless you have a very large deep skillet I suggest you brown the onion and ground beef in a large skillet, add the taco seasoning and ranch dressing mix and the can of diced tomatoes and then transfer the mixture to a stew pot with a slotted spoon. The diced tomatoes will deglaze the skillet so you won't loose the the browned beef flavoring. Add the remaining ingredients to the stew pot except for he chicken broth. Add chicken broth to get your desired thickness and simmer for 1 hour.",
