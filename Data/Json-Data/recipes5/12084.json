Searing the pork loin in the pot before making the stew gives you a great base of flavors so the stew seems as if it indeed simmered all afternoon.

I did make a few alterations and additions however. I used one each large poblano and jalapeno pepper in place of the serrano, also added 4 med coarse chopped tomatilloes. Used 3c. chicken stock to 1c water and substituted masa flour  for corn meal by way of a slurry.  To pump up flavor a bit I added a splash of Maggi seasoning and 1 tsp. of New Mexico Chile Powder as well as a splash of  Tamari soy sauce to taste.  I did give this an additional 30 min cook time with the pork going in for the last 30. I cut  6 tortillas into 1/4\" strips and fried them for a topper then served with  a dollop of Mex style sour cream, crumbled Queso Fresco and cilantro and lime for garnish.  Will make this again and again!  Happy cooking....",
