It makes a really unique of \"almost\" BBQ sauce.  I marinated my chicken for about 8 hours then had hubby grill it. It started burning at first, but he had the grill too hot. My 3 year old son kept asking for more on his plate. I might make a double or triple batch of sauce next time and freeze the extra so ill always have it on hand. I'm going to make this again soon for our end-of-summer grill out.",
