The second time, I only used 1 T., added 1/2 tsp more of onion and garlic powder, and 1 T. more of brown sugar.  We also marinated the pork this time in pineapple juice and brown sugar for several hours before cooking.  Both times, I sprayed a large baking dish and baked at 325 until the internal temp was close to 160.  Came out very juicy and with just enough spice for me this time!  DELICIOUS!",

                "reviewBody": "We had a 3# tenderloin that needed to be used tonight.  Decided on this recipe because we LOVE using chipotle peppers/seasoning in our cooking.  Used all of the seasonings the recipe called for and then some (added Ancho Chili Powder and a few splashes of Chipotle Tabasco on each side), and let marinate for about 15 minutes. (side note...for next time, we'll let this marinate overnight) For the cooking, we opted to not use the grill tonight.  Instead got out the cast iron skillet and seared on Med-High for about 4-5 minutes on each side.  Then put the skillet into a 400 degree oven 25 minutes.  Temp pork at 140 degrees.  Removed from cast iron and let rest for 10 minutes. Carryover heat will finish it off. To make a pan sauce...reheat and deglaze with 1/2 cup of your favorite red wine (water will do, but wine is better!). (the measurements for pan sauce are NOT approximate) If you want a thicker sauce, make a slurry with 1tbs of wine and 1tbs of flour.  Add to your deglazed pan.  To that, add 1 1/2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp onion powder, 1tb fresh cracked black pepper, 2 tsp of salt, and a couple dashes of Chipotle Tabasco.  Serve over sliced pork and enjoy!!  We sure are!!  :)",

Since there was a snowstorm outside I made on my grill pan and it took twice as long to cook. It was well worth the wait though as this was some of the best pork I have ever had. It was spicy (my husband and I both like spicy food) but I served with some mango apple sauce and it made a great combo.

Chili powder of any variety is a blend of peppers, herbs (usually oregano), spices (usually cumin), salt, and garlic.  Chili pepper is just that - dried ground up pepper.  So if you don't have the chipotle chili POWDER, you definitely need to use a lot less and add some cumin, oregano and more garlic powder to get the right flavor and heat level.  :-)  The recipe as written is very tasty, certainly spicy, and has the most flavor when grilled.",
