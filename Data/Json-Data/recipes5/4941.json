This recipe for all it's effort is delightful and if you have all of the ingredients at hand is a breeze to make. I was able to find the cr\u00e8me fraiche and HIGHLY recommend that you make every attempt to procur this as it has a texture all of it's own. To try to use any other substitute will not be comparable. I would NOT suggest using whipping cream as whipping cream doesn't have the same texture as cr\u00e8me fraiche the closest -texture wise to cr\u00e8me fraiche is sour cream but to get the taste of cr\u00e8me fraiche you'll want to mix sour cream AND whipping cream I would suggest 2 Tablespoons of sour cream and 1 Tablespoon heavy whipping cream. If you notice the webisode she speaks of using chicken thighs - I don't pretend to know why but imagine this would be due to the thigh having more fat thus it won't be dried out like a breast would. This had GREAT plate appeal (see picture I submitted) and it tasted phenomenal!!!! Thank you Allrecipes for the webisode and thank you contributor for having shared a delightful recipe!!! (Update 18 Jan 2015) I've made this three times now and it's amazing! It is a special meal so I don't make it all the time and to the person who gave it a low review you likely messed up. Please don't downgrade a recipe if your cooking is not up to par. This is far from bland and you're just needing additional kitchen skills.",

I followed the recipe as written except used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. The single solitary little clove seemed silly until I tasted it and realized it is was a magical little clove that added serious depth to the flavors. Delicious! I saved the stock and made chicken noodle soup out of it which also was wonderful.",
