They were already really tender. Then I baked in oven for only 20 min. Perfect!",

I followed the recipe with the exception of decreasing the brown sugar and omitting the cinnamon. Followed the baking times exactly which cooked them perfectly for us. I cut mine in wedges before serving. The hardest part of this recipe is cutting the squash in half. LOL! But here s a little tip microwave the whole squash for 2 minutes on high. That will soften it just enough and will make it a little easier to cut in half using a large chef's knife.",
