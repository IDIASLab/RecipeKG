I liked the fact that I didn't have to slave over a hot, greasy skillet to brown these bad boys.  Some changes I made:  I didn't have Old Bay, so I used smoked paprika, celery seeds, black pepper, sea salt and garlic powder instead.  Also used about double the vegetables because I like 'em with lots of veggies. To save time, I chilled the mixture in the freezer for about 15-20 mins.  Worked fine.  And, because I like crispy, crusty cakes, I used about 2/3rds cup (or slightly more) almond flour for coating, well seasoned with my \"Old Bay\" replacement (smoked paprika, celery seeds, garlic powder, black pepper and sea salt.)  Baked at 400 degrees for just over 20 mins and flipped them about half way through -- flipping was a little difficult because I didn't think to oil the foil.  Made 9 cakes, just enough for three people -- I will double recipe next time so I have leftovers.  Served with homemade coleslaw and a homemade spicy sauce for the cakes.  Will definitely make again. ;-)",

Once I formed them into patties they kept falling apart so I sprinkled almond flour on each side instead of dredging them. I read the reviews where people flipped their cakes to brown both sides so I intended to flip them as well. At 20 minutes I couldn't flip them without them falling apart. Instead I brushed each crabcake with a little melted butter repositioned my oven rack and broiled them for 5 minutes to brown the tops. The result was fantastic! Topped with paleo-style remoulade to serve.",
