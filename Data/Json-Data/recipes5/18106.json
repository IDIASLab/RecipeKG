I did manage to make sauce out of it by omitting the water and reducing the cider vinegar to a 1/2 cup. I also reduced the chili powder to 2 Tbsp. and the black pepper for the children. I mixed everything in a saucepan over medium heat to get rid of the sugar grit and stirred in a can of tomato paste. Not bad.",
