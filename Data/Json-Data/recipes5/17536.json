I made quite a few changes but they were all minor: I subbed olive oil for vegetable pure maple syrup for brown sugar fresh herbs and garlic for dried and cashews and pistachios for peanuts (I don't eat peanuts). I also left out the celery and carrot because of personal preference. I used dehydrated banana which has more of a chewy raisin texture. As unusual as the banana is in this dish I wouldn't be afraid of it--it blends in perfectly with the rest of the flavors. Next time I'll increase the herbs peppers and onions because they add a great flavor.",
