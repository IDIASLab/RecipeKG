Because my seitan was firmer than store bought I didn't bother with frying it. I just added it to the sauce and let it heat through. I thought the sauce was just the right consistency as is so I didn't add the cornstarch.

Because there was a lot of spices it helped thicken the sauce I also added the soy milk slowly while stirring to make sauce smooth. I subbed coconut oil for the peanut oil and margarine. I used tomato sauce instead of puree and it tasted just fine. I didn't have the soupy texture like other reviewers in fact I omitted the cornstarch because it was already super thick but did add water to even out the spices. The recipe was delicious a great flavorful meal to complement any vegetarian or vegan diet. Definitely going to make again when I have more seitan.",
