I let the chops marinate for 8 hours before grilling.  These were awsome!  \nBTW... the USDA just revised their recommendations for cooked pork temps.  They now recommend cooking pork to an internal temp of 145 degrees, and then letting rest for 3 minutes.",

I made the marinade, but opted to skip the ginger and cinnamon, just as a personal preference.  As instructed I marinated the pork in half the marinade.  But before grilling I decided to thicken the reserved marinade to give it some body for basting.  I simmered it for the 5 minutes as indicated in step 4, but it wasn\u2019t thickening for me, so I added a little cornstarch/water slurry to thicken it, just enough to coat the back of a spoon.  That gave it much better cling for basting and allowed me to do it ahead of time.",

However, the pork was delicious and with a little reworking on the sauce, that would be delicious too. It almost tastes like an upscale, really interesting A1 Sauce. Just skip either the sugar or the honey and use only a sprinkle of cinnamon. I'm hanging on to this one! Thanks! :o)",
