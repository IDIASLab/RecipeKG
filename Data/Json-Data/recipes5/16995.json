I also like my sauces a little thicker, so I added a bit more cornstarch as the submitter suggested.  If you want a richer color, add a couple drops of red food coloring - it works wonders.  This stuff was great and my husband took one taste and all he could say was \"Mmmmmmm\".  We ate this with egg rolls, and it was perfect.",
