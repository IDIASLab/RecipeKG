I did not have fresh sage leaves so I just sprinkled a little rubbed sage in there.  As far as the quantity of beans, I used 1.5 cans which was the perfect ratio for this serving size.  Just love the burst of lemon in every bite with a little bit of crunch here and there! For appearance sake, its best to serve the day it was made though!!",
