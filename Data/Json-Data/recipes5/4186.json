Just stir frequently and don't leave them unattended or they will burn. Pour them onto a plate to cool and set aside. 2. In a medium skillet simmer 1/2 cup of low sodium fat free chicken broth 3-4 minutes over medium high heat it will reduce slightly. While broth simmers measure out 3 tbsp. of butter. 3. Reduce heat to medium low and add the butter 1 tbsp. at a time. The sauce will thicken as the butter is added. Continue to simmer an additional 1-2 minutes until the sauce is thickened. Add lemon juice and parsley 4. Pour sauce over asparagus and sprinkle with sesame seeds. I only used a tbsp. The author's posted recipe is delicious as written but I can't eat a single serving of asparagus so I needed something a little bit lighter!",
