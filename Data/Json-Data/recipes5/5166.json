Shared it with about 20 other AR friends at Marianne's Sauza Tequila party yesterday. A real homerun! You will be amazed with the dressing and fresh blend of veggies. Like Bibi, I used 1 lb of spring greens and that was perfect. I agree with Christine that it puts me in mind of a Mexican Caesar salad. Thanks again, Savvy!",

I loved everything going on in this salad...the crunch form the lettuce peppers and croutons the sharpness of the parm cheese the savory black beans and the sweetness of the corn (I used canned) combined w/ the dressing mmmm... Oh and I added some vidalia onions in there too. All of the flavors blended beautifully! This really did remind me of a 'Mexicen Caesar Salad'. I will def be making this again and again...it's so fun festive and refreshing! Thanks Saveur for sharing this!:)",

I've made the dressing two additional times just to have on a simple lettuce salad. I admit to 2 changes in the recipe. I use anchovy paste in the dressing rather than fillets as I always have the paste on hand. Also I had to use frozen corn but it was fresh off-the-cob corn that I had froze. I made this for my son and DIL's Couples Wedding Shower and it was a huge hit. I came home with an empty bowl and no dressing left.:o) Fantastic recipe Savvy - thanks for sharing.",
