I used about 2-2.5 cups not reducing the hot pepper sauce or garlic and it was fine. Also cut the flour to 2C (not changing the seasoning amounts) and still had flour left over (which we used in biscuits and gravy). These pieces wanted to brown very quickly and only took about 3-3.5 minutes per side then all went in the oven for 45 minutes (my chicken pieces were on the small side). Had no problems with breading falling off or chicken not cooked through. Tasted good cold too and reheated nicely in the oven.",
