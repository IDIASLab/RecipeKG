I did do something alittle different sorry I drained the oil used 1/4 c. of orange juice and 1/4 c. of chicken broth I keep a container of it in the fridge scrapped the brown bits up. Put a can of low fat cream of mushroom soup in it. The only reason for that is because we had rice with it and my husband has to have gravy. I'll diffently make this again. Thanks.",

I used about 2 lbs of chicken thighs with the amount of seasonings called for in the recipe and grilled them instead of cooking them on stove-top (only because my husband wanted to grill the chicken). I boiled the orange juice and reduced it slightly and poured it over the chicken when they were done. I love the taste of this chicken so very much! I understand that the lady who submitted this recipe is no longer with us and I just want to say that this is a great legacy to leave behind. Thank you so much for this wonderful tasting but really easy recipe!!",
