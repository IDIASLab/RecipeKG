You might think the sauce too thin the first time you make it (almost a thick broth), but it will be full of flavor. Quantities of tuna, sun-dried tomato, and artichoke are variable to preference, just be sure to provide an overall robust combination, always mindful of potential saltiness (esp. regarding the sun-dried tomatoes). Also, fresh oregano or lemon thyme could be substituted for thyme. This should go without saying: please don't put any cheese on this pasta.",

Overall, a flavorful dish but a bit too much work for the outcome in my opinion.  This took me a long time to prepare.  In step three, leave more liquid than 3/4 cup; I thought the sauce was a bit too pasty.  Also note that if you use dried thyme you should use only 1/3 what is called for.  (This is the standard fresh-to-dried ratio for herbs.)",
