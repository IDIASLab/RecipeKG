Unfortunately, it's also one of the most bizarre looking ingredients, and that does scare some people off. But these sausage patties are so moist and flavorful, I do hope you give them a try.",

The only change I made was I didn t wrap in the fat casing but instead decided to bind them like a crab cake or chicken croquettes. So I mixed in a few eggs bread crumbs and mayonnaise and shredded cheddar cheese and these were absolutely delicious.",
