The way I make it now is I use one zuchini one yellow squash one red pepper and baby portabellas and I double the marinade. The last time I made it I added a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper and some chopped fresh cilantro to the marinade and after taking the vegetables out of it to put on the skewers I threw some fresh shrimp into the marinade while I grilled the vegetables and then grilled the shrimp and it was great! This is our new favorite way to have vegies and shrimp! Also like other reviewers said it is best to marinate in a large ziplock bag so you can flip it over to marinate really good and dry basil works great in place of fresh.",

I also added salt and pepper and extra garlic to the marinade. My husband loved this recipe and it made for a quite colorful presentation. If you marinate overnight you might not want to add the eggplant until the next morning as it overabsorbs the marinade and may be too strong in flavor for some.",

I now chop in large segments and grill on a bbq grill plate. Still love it... wonderfu!! I do add extra garlic:) and truly although dried basil works fresh is wonderful! lThe 4 stars is more from my way of preparing. Should not have left them to marinated as long as I did (about 3 hours)as the lemon taste was a tiny bit too strong. I also only had one clove of garlic too bad could have used more! The vegetable mix was wonderful. I love eggplant and you can do almost any vegie mix with this. Throw in a jalapeno for a little bite! Had only dried basil but it worked fine. Always marinate in a bag - so much easier to just flip it over. Will be making again for sure!",

I put everything into a ziploc bag along with the marinade tossed everything to coat and let it go for a couple of hours. I skewered the veggies and basted with the leftover marinade.
