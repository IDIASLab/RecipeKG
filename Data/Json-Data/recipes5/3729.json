What he didn t love about it is exactly what I did! It s not overly gooey and mayonnaise-y the dressing is lighter and fresher than the standard mayonnaise-based potato salads. I didn t use the commercial Italian dressing choosing to make my own light vinaigrette (3 parts olive oil to 1 part white wine vinegar and a little minced garlic). As for it s being bland what?! You ve got the fresh taste of the dill the green onion and the tang of the lemon juice and Dijon. What I really liked about this was that you could actually taste the potatoes! So I guess this might be called a dressing for potatoes not potato salad where the flavor of the potatoes seems to typically get lost. Three stars from him five from me four stars between us.",
