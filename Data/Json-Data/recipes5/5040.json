I used an electric pressure cooker (Cuisinart, high pressure, natural release). The result is nice and creamy.  Four stars only because I'm partial to bigger flavor. I'll play around with it a bit based on some other recipes I've seen.  That's the fun of cooking, right? Perhaps some tomato paste, smoked paprika, whole coriander toasted in a dry skillet before grinding...",
