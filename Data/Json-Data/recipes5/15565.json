We only used 1 can of corn too as I usually don't like corn. Not this time. Measured burgers using 1/4 cup so burgers would cook evenly. Made 5 fat burgers. We only had small tortillas so cut burgers in half and they rolled up nicely. Make sure you top tortilla with the baked salsa as well as the sour cream and lettuce. The combo makes the meal. Thanks for this keeper recipe. Taco Seasoning 1 tablespoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon black pepper Store in an airtight container.",
