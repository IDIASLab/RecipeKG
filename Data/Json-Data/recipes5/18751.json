While it was tasty with the coconut cherries and raisins mixture the recipe does fall short in one way. The bottom of the baking pan should be sprayed with vegetable spray for ease of removing the bars from the pan after baking. Also everyone who makes this make sure you do not overbake the bottom crust - 15 min. max and make sure to spray dish beforehand. They were good but not sure I'll take the time to make again.",
