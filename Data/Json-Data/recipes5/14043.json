Italian (pasta) and Mexican cuisines do not combine and merge very well to tasteful results. The sauce by itself is wonderful over chicken like another reviewer said but I would not advise using the sauce over pasta. Perhaps over shrimp and orzo instead would taste better? I did not make the past in the recipe but used a store bought fresh version. I don t think that makes any difference to the taste anyway. I thought it was bland and needed lots of salt and pepper. I feel as though this was a waste of tomatillos even though it is super easy. For a good tomatillo and cilantro recipe search for Tomatillo Soup by Holly on this website.",

And then I was really turned off by the color and texture of the pasta dough. It looked like something other than food. I have made pasta from scratch before and had it turn out scrumptious but this pasta recipe was difficult for me to work with--it was very dry and thick and didn't roll out well and the end result was terribly heavy and chewy. And like Pumpkin said some flavors just weren't meant to go together. Maybe it was a huge mental block for us? I usually like \"oddball\" recipes but this one doesn't make the cut.",
