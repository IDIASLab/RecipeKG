After reading the reviews I think this is one of those recipes that require a good oven. If you have a poor quality one the fluctuation in temperate will make it impossible to make these. I flipped mine every hour and a half and reapplied the sauce. This made them a bit too spicy so next time I will only re-coat them only two or three times. If you don't like spicy cut down on the black pepper. The only reason I am giving it four and not five stars is because the spicy is on the front of the tongue and not on the back. Proper spicy should be on the back or balanced. I am going to try a dash of cayenne pepper or heat the sauce with a small piece of a habanero in it before applying it. That should balance out the spice. All in all I never have tried jerky tofu before and for a long time vegan this is a nice new way to enjoy my tofu. Thank you!!!! Added: I left one piece out and took a little bite each day. I lasted 8 days before it started to get a little too tough.",
