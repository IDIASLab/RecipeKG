Funny thing is I have tried for years to make a ham with a sticky glaze like his mother made. She would never tell me the secret. So I figured maybe this was it. Only thing is she would pour a jar of cherry ham glaze on top at the end to trick evryone in thinking this was the only glaze on it. I tried this and only changed one thing. I added some pumpkin spice with extra clove spice and allspice to make it a bit spicer and it works great! At the end if any of the glaze is bare pat on more ketchup and sugar mix and turn up heat for 15 minutes.",
