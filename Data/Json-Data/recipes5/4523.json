The lemon juice replaces standard vinegar for that flavor. Always use FRESH lemon juice and of course you can adjust to taste. However even though I appreciate innovation this dressing is generally NOT recommended for slaws potato salads etc. It is the best on a green salad with plenty of other flavors to mingle with such as tomatoes cucumbers onions etc. Also I indicated it is great for salads containing grilled meats and feta cheese is also awesome. In other words the tangy garlicky factor nicely compliments other flavors. I hope this helps and enjoy!",
