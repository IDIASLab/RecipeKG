At no time should there be any butter floating as a glob that you have to \"mop\" up. You don't have your crock pot hot enough. Start it out on high if you plan on having this drink in a couple of hours. I let it usually simmer for 4-5 hrs and it is an after dinner drink. When the crock is steaming and the buter is glistening, then you have your batch correct. Don't add the rum to the pot if it is too much. Add it to the each mug to taste. If you alter this recipe with splenda or margarine and still rate this poorly, that is your problem. Best of luck to those who take another stab at it. I think you will be happier with the results...",

Since I do not keep whole cloves on hand I just emptied out a teabag and put 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves in the empty teabag. I then put the teabag in the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients. (I also added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon allspice to the teabag.) I love vanilla and added 1 teaspoon of that to the water mixture. These additions mingle well with the original recipe especially if you love holidy spices like I do!",

Then I got some cinnamon sticks for when I make this again on Christmas Eve for the family. It was wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!",

When I discovered that this was a slow cooker drink I panicked with only 2 hours away from company arriving. I decided to start out the batch on the stove and brought to a boil then simmered for approx. 15 minutes. I then placed the batch in the slow cooker and placed on high for 2.5 hours. This was PERFECT!!... I also agree if anyone has butter floating on the top..... IT'S NOT READY... Keep simmering until the butter is not floating on top. KEEP THAT LID ON and let it cook!!...
