        "description": "As legend has it, Yorkshire puddings were traditionally cooked in a pan of fat, at the bottom of a hearth, underneath a large piece of roasting beef. The smoky heat from the fire, along with all the other goodness dripping into the pan from the meat, must've made for quite a delicious pastry. Though limited by modern ovens, we can still come close to the original by using real rendered beef fat, without which you're just eating a popover.",

Probably not, why not explain it out put the 7/8 cups of flour but say in the recipe that it is 14 tablespoons (or two tablespoons less than a cup)?  \n\nI don't know why but that really bothered me.  \n\nThe oil was too much, you could cut that back to a half or even less a teaspoon.  \n\nI heard from my mother-in-law who was raised in England that the pan or tin needed to be very hot and the drippings or fat is what made it the pudding and not a popover (meaning if you only use butter than it is a popover).  Her's always came out amazing.  Wish I paid more attention while she was alive, now I just try to find one.",
