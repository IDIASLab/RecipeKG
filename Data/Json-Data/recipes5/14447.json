First off are used wild mushrooms that I forged and dried from earlier this year. Are used golden chanterelles Cinnabar red chanterelles and hen-of-the-woods. I also only sprinkled a little bit of oregano no because I wasn t so sure this was the right herb for this dish. I added a dash of Cayanne pepper. I also added a very large spoon of pur\u00e9ed pumpkin. At the end I took a little bit in 2 cups and add heavy cream to one and sour cream to the other. Both were very good with the flavor but the heavy cream with a little bit better. I ultimately use the sour cream because I needed to have a cream for whipping cream today.",
