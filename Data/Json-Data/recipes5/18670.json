So simple versatile healthy & tasty! Be sure to stir the dressing ingredients until the sugar dissolves completely. Eat this on its own or toss w/ some salad greens & top w/crumbled blue cheese & toasted pecans (serve w/ some extra dressing). Instead of dicing the apples simply slice them and toss w/ dressing in a ziploc bag - makes a great snack for kids. Different & special. REALLY DELICIOUS!! Try it you'll love it.",
