My issue with these is they fall apart. I cut them when they had cooled... crumbled. I chilled them in the fridge they crumbled. The only way I was able to get a nice cut was to freeze them and then cut them. I would recommend baking them with foil so you can lift the whole thing out of the pan and then wrap in the foil to freeze before cutting. They dont get hard.. not at all but at least they held together better. I dont think kids would like these as they are not very sweet.. but I liked them a lot",
