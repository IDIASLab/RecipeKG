I substituted a jar of a popular Alfredo sauce.  Food during this period is something fun to look forward, fortunately our children are grown and with almost grown children of their own, so I feel comfortable in signing on to AllRecipes and finding something new to try. It's sometimes hard to do this when you're trying to please small children and get some nutrition in their systems too.  I really feel for all the parents of small children at this time, it's hard keep children occupied even during the best of times.",
