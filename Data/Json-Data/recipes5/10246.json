I had most of the ingredients and I needed something that was fast not spicy (husband) and would use some of the kale I had in the fridge. I made some changes based on groceries on hand. I used 1# Johnsonville sweet Italian bulk sausage subbed mini penne for gemelli used 1 can of evaporated 2% milk and used garlic granules in place of fresh. It turned out waaay better than I had hoped though I used only 1/2 of the cooked pasta there was just not enough sauce for all of it. Also didn't have a fresh tomato so I drained a can of diced tomatoes and used 1/2 in place of the tomato. Though some of the recipes I've tried lately were duds this was worth my time and I will make it again so thanks for the post.",

I only had 4 oz. of pasta and that was plenty for the dish I wouldn't use the full amount listed in the recipe because we prefer things a bit saucier. I also didn't need the reserved pasta water; next time I would just add extra milk if needed. Kale is a bit tough and even though I cooked it longer than stated I would cook it even longer next time to help reduce the chewiness. But this was a nice one-dish meal. The combination of flavors was really good.",
