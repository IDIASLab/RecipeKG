Instead of slicing your cabbage, I suggest you chop it. Both my hubs and I agree that chopped or finely shredded cabbage (i.e. the pre-packaged stuff) would be a better choice for this dish. It would cook quicker (as is, my cabbage was a *tad* crunchy - and I even cooked it longer than directed) and incorporate MUCH better with the potatoes. I guess this is a matter of preference, but it is a definite must for my hubs and I. And for the one reviewer who thought this was bland... Bah! The key is s&p and LOTS of it. :) It's a shame this only has three reviews. Hopefully others will follow suit and soon discover this wonderful gem and add their positive comments for others to see! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ashley! :-)",

The only changes I made were to omit the mayonnaise (we just don't care that much for mayo), added a little more than 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, added about 1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt to the cabbage mixture, and omitted the ham.  Everyone thought it was great and my boyfriend asked me to make it again--very soon.  Thank you for another great recipe. Edit: I made this again 11/2019 and made a couple of changes. I boiled the potatoes in vegetable stock and then, in place of 1/2 cup of water I added 1/2 cup of the potato/vegetable stock. I used seasoned salt, pepper, and Mrs. Dash to season it. Very, very good. Hubby (boyfriend in earlier review) loved it and has asked me to make it again, only two days after I made it before. Success!",

I had to use up the potatoes and cabbage that I used for my corned beef and cabbage that I am baking according to another recipe on this site. The cabbage was not very thinly slice so it took over 30 minutes to wilt when it was with the onion mixture.",
