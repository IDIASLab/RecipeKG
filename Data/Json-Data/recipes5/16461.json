I use 1 cup uncooked white Basmati rice (which is nutty) to 1/2 cup wild rice.  My wild rice calls for 65 minutes of cooking, and it's perfect.  This week I substitued walnuts for almonds  (almonds are better), and I've used dried, chopped dates instead of dried cranberries, but Kathy's combo of tastes & textures is the best (except that I've never had fresh mushrooms on the days I've made this recipe & I often forget the orange zest!)  This is one of those forgiving recipes that is nearly impossible to ruin.  This is my very first review...sorry it took so long to say \"Thank You\".\nUpdate March 2015 - I've now been making this dish for 10 years, and it's still a family favorite.  Our son, now grown and living on the opposite coast, craves it every time he comes home.  Now that we are empty-nesters, I freeze half and discovered it holds its flavor and  texture after freezing and reheating in the microwave!",

I don't like the onion wedges in this though.\r\n\r\nI make the recipe just as written except that I sliver the onion wedges so that the onion is in short thin strips.\r\n\r\nThis reduces the cooking time for the onions (20 minutes) considerably since more surface area of the onions are exposed.\r\n\r\nI also toast the almonds before using them.  PLace the almond slivers on a baking sheet and pop into a preheated 350*F oven.  Eacth them closely, they will burn if not tended to.  Stir the almonds frequently til light brown.\r\n\r\nThe toasted almonds make the dish taste deeper and nuttier.",
