But, I have a few quick tips for those who need to get it done a little faster.  First, I use frozen green beans, the are just as healthy and good. Also I use prediced onion from my grocery produce section  or  frozen onions. There is also something known as season blend vegetables that I sometimes use. Next, I use ready made bacon which I slice in bite size pieces. I get the full bacon flavor without all of the excess fat & no salt chicken stock so I can control the sodium amounts. You can also use canned potatoes or if you're not a fan use mini red or yellow potatoes.",

I only had a quarter of a yellow onion so I used that with a shallot. I used a bag of the fancy fingerling potatoes (with the purple and red potatoes) and had a carton of portabello buttons. I added the mushrooms with the potatoes at the end. Oh and I used almost a pound of bacon (the kids kept swiping it) and added a bay leaf and some Emeril's seasoning. Very flavorful and yummy!",
