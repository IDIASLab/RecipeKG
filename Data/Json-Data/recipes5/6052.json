I liked the consistency of the soup with the beaten eggs added but I felt like the soup as a whole was missing something. I probably should have added another potato to make it more hearty and I should've made my own chicken broth (I had used the store bought kind). The dill flavor came out really light. This soup would be perfect for those looking for a light soup.",
