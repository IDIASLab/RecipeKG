This is a great recipe on its own, but I\u2019ve found it a wonderful launch into my own creativity in healthful cooking.  I\u2019ve seldom used oil with this recipe.  I substitute applesauce, pumpkin, cooked and pureed carrots, squash, and banana, in place of oil.  I often add pumpkin pie spice with the squash, carrots, or pumpkin, or cinnamon with the applesauce.    I always add flax seed, and use half whole wheat flour and half unbleached.  I seldom use all the sugar.  I\u2019ve substituted molasses or honey for the sugar, or just cut it in half.  I make this recipe so frequently; I now stock fat free buttermilk.  I don\u2019t like raisins, and find myself adding shredded carrots, dates, pecans, walnuts, carob chips, and coconut, whatever I have on hand.  Thank you Janet, my family truly enjoys this versatile recipe.",

I did make a few adjustments like other posters did: 1/3 c apple sauce for the oil, 2 egg whites for the 1 egg, 1 tbsp lemon juice with skim milk for the buttermilk, and cinnamon.  I used post raisin bran for the bran (because it gets too soggy in milk; I was going to throw the box away) and picked out the raisins.

I also couldn't find wheat bran, so I first made a batch with a store brand of Fiber One (the ones that look like twigs).  I made another batch with All Bran bran buds.  Both came out delicious.  I had better results just spraying the muffin tins with Pam.  When I used paper liners the first time, they didn't come off easily because of the low fat content.  I've added dried cranberries, chopped walnuts, chopped dates and about 1 tsp cinnamon.  I gave some away to friends and they said they really enjoyed them (their kids too!)  I'll make these frequently since they're a great snack...lots of fiber too.",
