I turned the ham over in the roaster every hour or so to evenly distribute the cola juices. This saved me from having to stay in the kitchen to frequently baste it. I skipped the step with the paste and additional cooking on a roasting rack. This ham is very juicy not salty at all and very tasty. When my guests heard how I was making the ham there was a lot of raised eyebrows. But when it came time to eat...let's just say I never heard them be soooo silent. All their skepticism went away with the first bite. Thank you for posting this recipe and the bellies of my guests thank you!!!!!",

We had 2 half hams that totalled just over 8lbs combined. I scored the top of both hams and poured 2 cans cola over them. (Two cans gave me about a half inch in the bottom of my big roast pan.) I left the lid on and basted about every 15-20 minutes with the cola in the bottom of the ham. I didn't make the recommended paste for our ham but rather did what I usually do when making a ham. Mix together 1 cup brown sugar 1 tbsp dry mustard 1 tsp yellow mustard and enough real maple syrup to make a thick \"slurry\". The ham was baked in total for 2 hours. During the last half hour is when I brushed on the maple mixture with the lid off. My partners scepticism about cola and ham together went away with the first bite he had! I didn't tell our guests till after they were done that it was basted with cola...my mother and father-in-law had 5 plates between the 2 of them! The cola was a tasty addition to my old recipe. Thanks so much!",
