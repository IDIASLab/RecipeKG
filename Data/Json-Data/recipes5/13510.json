                "reviewBody": "Hey everyone - this is my recipe, But a few things seem to be changed by Allrecipes since it was published.  I do a few things differently.\n\n1)  Do not place the full amount of bread crumbs or egg substitute out at once.  I start with small amounts and replenish as needed.  It minimizes the amount of waste.\n2)  I also spray with cooking spray pretty generously.  I don't leave them swimming in it, but if you use too light of a hand, you have a higher chance of the breading falling off.\n3)  You do have to REALLY spray the baking sheet to less breading sticks to it.  I am very gentle when I turn them, but you will typically lose some breading.  I don't tend to lose a lot though.\n4)  When they are done cooking, I put buffalo sauce in a bowl and literally coat them in it.  This really gives them true wing flavor.  That said, it also makes them pretty spicy.  If you don't like as much heat, a dash works fine.  I then return them to the over to bake for the 5 minutes indicated.\n\nPlay with the recipe and see what works for you.  I was just happy to have a non-fried alternative that had some crunch to it.  Happy cooking!",

I placed a cookie cooling rack on the baking sheet sprayed the rack liberally with Pam and baked the strips directly on the rack and they were crisp on both sides and barely lost any breading. With 5 min left in the cook time I drizzled buffalo sauce on half of them for my family that likes it hot. The remainder with out the added sauce were great too. I used 3 huge breast cut into large strips. Definitely plenty of marinade and breading for more chicken. This is a keeper for my recipe box!!",

Anyway...I don't bother w/buttermilk - the acid in the hot sauce thickens plain ol milk. I go half n half with amounts of milk & hot sauce. I use a regular egg mixed with a bit of milk. I also season up the panko with celery salt garlic powder fresh grated parm and a some cayenne pepper. I do leave the chicken to marinade overnight. With my changes these rock and you can quickly toss with a buffalo wing sauce if you really want to kick things up! Easier eating vs chicken wings (although I like those too).",

Didn't realize I had ran out of Frank's so used Sriracha instead - a delicious alternative! 1 cup of buttermilk to 1/4 cup hot sauce marinated with 3 sliced chicken breasts produced very moist and flavorful chicken strips. They got a huge stamp of approval from the boyfriend but as delicious as they were we couldn't even finish them all. But not to worry the boyfriend had the leftovers finished by 10am the next morning. I did find the breading a little heavy though. I don't usually use egg when I bread meats (which is quite frequently) which is perhaps the difference?",
