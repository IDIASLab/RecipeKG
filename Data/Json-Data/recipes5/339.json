I realize that often hummus has to sit awhile in the refrigerator for flavors to maximize and I didn't do that initially. Right after mixing I felt it needed more sweetener and more chocolate. Thus a 3 rating. After adding a few more Tablespoons of sweetener and another heaping Tablespoon of cocoa I would bump it up to a 4. My husband really liked it! So it is a good basic recipe you may want to play with the ingredients.",
