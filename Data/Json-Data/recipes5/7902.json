Growing up in a house that had Italian sauce being made every Sunday, this eggplant was always a favorite. Using good quality ingredients is critical for this recipe. It is very time consuming and laborious. It would be a shame to invest all of this time and effort with inferior ingredients only to be let down when you eat it later.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is very good and it does fill the bill for a classic eggplant Parmesan. A few suggestions:\n1.   After salting the egg plant you do not need to wait anywhere near eight hours to extract the water from the egg plant. I weighed the egg plant at two hours and I weighed again at eight hours and there\u2019s hardly any difference and this would indicate that you\u2019re not getting much more water off by waiting an additional six hours. Two hours is plenty.\n\n2.  You will notice the recipe calls for salt in the flour mixture and more salt in the egg mixture and salting the egg plant. Once you salt the egg plant, this recipe does not need any more salt. There\u2019s actually a lot of salt in tomato sauce and in cheese.  you do not need to add any more salt.\n\n3.  The recipe indicates how important  it is to get good ingredients. Problem is, fresh mozzarella is very soft and can\u2019t really be grated. The best mozzarella is buffalo mozzarella and trying to great that would be like greating bread dough.",

There was still a lot of fluid in the finished product.  A little Italian bread crumb in the layers should take care of it.  Since we are meat eaters, next time I plan to add ground meat.\n\nThanks",
