I wouldn't serve it to non-drinkers though. Be sure and cool the cake completely before frosting it. One time I made this I followed the instructions on the cake box (called for egg whites instead of whole eggs and 2 Tbl. oil instead of 1/2 cup). I wished I hadn't done that - the texture just wasn't right. I have found that 1 cup of milk is better than 1 1/2 cup - otherwise the frosting is a bit too runny. Note that 1 1/2 cups pecans is a 6 oz. package. Thanks so much for the recipe!!",

I used a butter pecan cake mix and substituted a cup of strong coffee for the coffe liquor (since the last cake I made that called for a cup of it tasted of nothing but booze) and the cake turned out great. The praline layer was positively delicious and the frosting? Y-U-M! I got so many compliments on the frosting itself as well as the cake when I brought it into work.

Absolutely the best and easy too! Not inexpensive though since Kahlua and 1 1/2 cups pecans aren't cheap but I must say this cake is worth every penny! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!My only suggestion would be to downsize the Cool-Whip from 12 oz. to 8 oz. size. There was so much frosting that I discarded some of it. I also think by downsizing the Cool-Whip that the flavor of the vanilla pudding would show through a little more and enhance the frosting. I highly recommend this cake!",

One thing you may want to consider: rather than spreading the frosting on the cake I split it evenly with sewing thread forming a top and bottom layer and spread the frosting in between pouring the pralines directly onto the cake (otherwise the pralines melt the frosting!). When I serve it I put a small dolop of frosting on the side as well. This makes a much cleaner presentation. Make this cake. You will not be disappointed!",
