This is a keeper in my recipe box. I highly recommend this recipe to anybody that wants to try a flavorful filling and fresh dinner. It was an easy weeknight meal.

I used frozen broccoli because that is what was on hand (we are on vacation) and I would definitely use the broccoli rabe or fresh broccoli in the future and add it right at the end so it is hot and crisp when served. I think it would be a 4 star meal with fresh broccoli and perhaps some zucchini mixed in.",

I had to make a few minor tweaks for what we had on hand (broccoli in place of rage and canned dice tomatoes in place of fresh) but none that should have drastically altered the flavor profile. I also used a ton less EVOO to lighten it up a bit. This just didn't taste like a happy marriage; I'm not sure what the purpose of the chicken soup is but I wish I'd gone w/my instincts and left it out. THANKS for the recipe!",

I doubled the garlic added a little bit of fresh ginger and used the clear Asian noodles (mung bean) instead of penne. Couldn t find the rabe so used regular broccoli and decided to add mushrooms on a whelm. I didn t add the red pepper flakes and also negated the cheese as I wanted the dish to be more healthy. Also didn t have cream of chicken so used cream of mushroom. It was as great as I thought It would be. Very light and flavorful and tasty!",
