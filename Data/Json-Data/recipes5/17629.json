I also omitted both the raisins and maple syrup and USED MILK instead of water. I never cook oatmeal with water because it has no flavor...I always use milk. It was nice and creamy and sweet and delicious. I may sprinkle in a few dashes of raw wheat germ before serving the next time for a little added nutrtion. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!",

I added one more teaspoon of brown sugar one more tablespoon of maple syrup was very generous when I shook in the cinnamon and a tiny bit of salt. I threw in about 1/2 teaspoon of butter and substituted 1/2 cup water for milk. I toasted some walnuts while the water was boiling because I don't like raisins and topped it with cream as well as blueberries (you can never add too much fruit). The base recipe was very good and the other suggestions were helpful. I feel that adding toasted walnuts made this a 4 star breakfast for myself and my husband.",

I also cooked the raisins and apples in with the oatmeal because I wanted a plump raisin and the apples to be cooked just slightly. This was quite good, though a little sweet for me! Next time, I'll either use just brown sugar or just maple syrup and I might use all milk or half milk, half apple juice.",
