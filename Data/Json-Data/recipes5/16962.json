And I added some chopped peanuts between the chocolate and peanut butter. I made them specifically for my boyfriend because he likes peanut butter much more than I do. When I tried them I knew they were too rich but he agreed that there was waayy to much peanut butter. I think if you used a 9x9 pan and cut the peanut butter mixture on top in half it would be descent. I'm was a little disappointed because all of the rave reviews had me pretty excited. Overall a big disappointment for us I'm gonna give them to the teenage boys next door.",
