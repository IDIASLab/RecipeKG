Because of this, I skipped the second part, and just used the 'sauce' section of the recipe. After I made the sauce, I threw in fresh spinach, chopped sundried tomatoes, the crabmeat and then tossed with the cooked pasta - topped with grated parm. I will try this with no seafood for my 'no seafood' husband, but what a great base to play with - simple, quick and tastes great. This is worth a try - Thanks for the recipe!!",

It\u2019s called The Feast of the Seven Fishes, and my guess is that Janet P.\u2019s mother-in-law is Italian, as I am.   In keeping with tradition, we tend to have the same seafood dishes year after year, but it was fun to try another family\u2019s dish.   I loosely followed the recipe, opting out of the oysters and using scallops instead.   I saut\u00e9ed the shrimp and scallops until nicely browned, then deglazed the pan with both lemon juice and a little white wine.  I used Alaskan King Crab, only because it was left over from another meal.  I didn\u2019t bother measuring the ingredients precisely, just enjoyed myself with the \u201ca little of this, a little of that\u201d approach, totally immersing myself in the enjoyment of the cooking process. This is an absolutely exquisite dish that needs no amendments.  My adding wine, while a nice addition, certainly wasn\u2019t vital \u2013 the recipe stands on its own.  If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that our Italian Christmas Eve dinner menu is so carved in stone, this definitely would be a beautiful part of the meal.",

Have to admit I added 10 oz. of frozen spinach (thawed) to the butter sauce because hubby and I needed some veggies...but the seafood came through nicely and the sauce really added richness. I'm sure it would be perfect without the spinach as well. I also served steamed veggies on the side. Very elegant!",

When cooking the seafood I sauteed a small onion and added 1/4 tsp of cumin and dried Italian seasonings. I also used more cayenne. I did not use butter when cooking the seafood.
