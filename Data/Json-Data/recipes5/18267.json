It wasn't the flavour....although that wasn't great either. It was the texture! The flavour of the butter/brown sugar was lost and my pineapple all stuck to the bottom of the dish (not burned on just didn't stick to the ham but rather the dish). We will never make this dish again.",

This recipe is wonderful! I had to substitute pineapple chunks for slices and sliced swiss cheese for grated but it was still wonderful. My adult daughter had stopped by just after I made it and had a taste of it....she then asked if she could have a couple of slices to make a sandwich for work. She told me the next day that it is as good cold as hot. My hubby who is a \"meat and potato\" guy also loved it and made a sandwich for his lunch too! In fact I misplaced the recipe so returned to re-print it and fix it for dinner tonight and rate this recipe...I WILL NOT LOSE IT AGAIN!",

He is not a meatloaf lover so why not ham instead. I was a little leary at first but let me tell you this is great. Nice flavor and texture. Easy to prepare and the whole faimly liked it. Something different I added was the cheese i didnt have swiss i had horseradis montery. It was a terrific punch to it. I will make this again and cant wait to tell others about it. I am sure they will put there noses up at it but when they taste it! Great way to use up your extra ham! Thanks!",
