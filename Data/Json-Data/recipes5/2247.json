I would give it 5 stars, except that I was concerned because the list of ingredients and the directions did not match up.  The red and blue layer called for 2 envelopes unflavored gelatin in the list of ingredients, but the directions said to add 1 packet for each layer.  What to do??  I went with the directions and used 2 packets for each of those layers and yes, it did turn out firm - but it looked perfect and served up beautifully like finger jello - the kids loved it - I would absolutely make it again - it may become a 4th of july standard in my home.",

The way the recipe is written will yield 3 layers not the 6 shown in photos. Also the amount of unflavored gelatin added with the cherry and blue raspberry JellO differs between the recipe (2 packets) and the instructions (1). I used the 2 packets per JellO flavor and this stuff set up very firm - finger JellO (jigglers) is a great way to describe it. I'd also consider spraying the bottom of your 13x9 pan with non stick spray; while mine wasn't necessarily difficult to remove I did leave some chunks of red JellO in the bottom of the pan. Overall fun and easy to make and visually impressive! (Especially if you aren't lazy like me and do more than 3 layers.)",
