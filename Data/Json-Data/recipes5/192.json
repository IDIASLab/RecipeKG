Cut a 5lbs pork shoulder into 1\" pieces and trimmed a majority of fat away from the meat. I baked in a Dutch Oven @ 300 degrees for 3 1/2 hours and served over rice. The guajillo chilies have a heat rating of only 3 so it is a mild stew. Truly one of the best meals I have ever eaten. I could not believe how delicious this turned out to be. I let it chill overnight and skimmed the addition fat from the top the next day. If this recipe was 10 stars I would give it it's just due! I saved the excess chili broth and placed about 1 tbl in my scrambled eggs the rest of the week. WOW",
