Tossed the veggies for a few minutes before putting on the skewers.  While the Kabobs were grilling, put the left-over Beef Marinade in a small sauce pan and brought it to a slow boil.  Grilled kabobs for only 9mins ... turning every 3mins ... They were juicy!!! Fortunately there was ample left-over meat (cooking for just my husband and I).  After Dinner we grilled the remaining meat to be used later in the week for left-overs. YUMMY!!",

I changed it a bit (not that it needed it, but I like to experiment and add my own touches) by substituting half of the lemon lime soda for Squirt citrus soda. I also added a tiny bit of liquid smoke. For the vegetables I used the ones in the recipe but added green zuchini and yellow zuchini. I got green, red and yellow bell peppers instead of just green. These were beautiful !! The tip of softening the peppers a bit prior to grilling worked like a charm. I did this only to the peppers and zuchini. This is the first time ever my boyfriend asked me to PLEASE make something again from all the recipes I have made from this site. Kids loved it too.\n\nUpdate: I was excited to make this one again. This time I followed the recipe to the letter . This time NO ONE liked it :( including me. The first time I did changes and also didn't marinated it overnight. It was flavorful and tender. Not sure what happened this time. Maybe it was the sirloin cut, or the overnight marinating made the sirloin tough, but i always tought marinade tenderizes. I was not as flavorful as before.",

I used low sodium soy sauce, white wine vinegar, minced garlic vs. garlic powder and since I didn't have garlic pepper seasoning I opted to substitute 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika. I never marinated anything with soda before and this was a nice change from using oils. I put everything into a ziploc bag and marinated the sirloin overnight which I highly recommend. I skewered red and green peppers, red and vidalia onion and cherry tomatoes separate from the meat as they cook at different rates. This smelled great and tasted even better!",

First we had no pop so I substituted lemonade and second I did not find good fresh pineapple so we left that out. However these did not take away from the wonderful flavor. (The lemonade we used was the type made from frozen concentrate not from powdered mix.) I do recommend using a quality cut of meat. We did use really good sirloin the first time we made these but the cut we used the second time was a little fatty and it was not nearly as tender or flavorful. White rice is a great side dish for these kabobs. The meat veggies and rice make a full meal... and a very good one at that!",
