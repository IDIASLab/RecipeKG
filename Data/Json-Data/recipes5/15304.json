You really need to add water at the end and not be scared that it will ruin the dish, it will not! You need a fairly runny consistency for the best pav bhaji. Garnish with fresh chopped tomatoes, onions, and fresh cilantro if desired. Serve with toasted white bread or bread rolls.",

I used my food processor to make quick work of grating the onion. Adding in the butter at the end really transforms the flavor. I'm not sure the small amount of corn was even worth opening up a can for - I might just leave it out next timed or add a bit more. Also this makes small servings so keep that in mind. I got the mild chile and pav bhaji masala from an international market.",
