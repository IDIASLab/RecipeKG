Our frigid weather, however, has made grilling hamburgers outdoors a dumb move \u2013 but where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way!  With a few minor adjustments to the recipe I was able to make this indoors with no muss and no fuss \u2013 as a meatloaf!   I adjusted the recipe to two servings, to use 1/2 pound ground beef.  I used fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder and added 1/4 cup of minced onion. To bind it I added 2 tablespoons each of bread crumbs and milk and 1/2 egg (lightly beat an egg and measure out 2 tablespoons).  I formed it into an itty-bitty loaf, topped it with some darn fine barbecue sauce, and baked it on a foil-lined cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  I let it set about 10 minutes before slicing it up. Each of the signature ingredients of cheddar cheese, horseradish and bacon (I used real bacon, cooked and crumbled) were barely apparent but the combination of them united to create something unique and special.  I\u2019m glad I was determined to make this recipe and simply improvised to do so.  This was a real treat, something to remember when the weather is more cooperative to make as a grilled burger on a bun.  When I do I\u2019ll omit the binders \u2013 the milk, bread crumbs and egg, but I\u2019ll keep all else the same, including my additions of minced onion and barbecue sauce.  It is the bacon, cheddar and horseradish, however, that are this recipe\u2019s delicious distinction.",

I actually weighed the meat (which I never do) and I think that for us 3 patties would have worked better than 4.  Next time I would use 1 1/2 lbs burger and the full 2 Tablespoon of horseradish.   Nonetheless, these were stellar burgers.  I used 2 slices real thick cut bacon, cooked crumbled instead of bacon bits.  My burger loving hubby LOVED these.  Thanks Lisa!",
