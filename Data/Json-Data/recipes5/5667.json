While it tasted great as I licked the beaters for the cream cheese mixture the lemon juice overpowered the pie so much that I couldn't even taste the bananas. I followed the recipe but assembled it differently. I didn't fold the whipped cream with the cream cheese instead I spread the cream cheese mixture on the bottom of the pie (without the whipped cream) added the sliced bananas then the blueberry pie filling and topped it off with 8 oz. of Cool Whip. I'd eaten a pie like this when I visited family in Louisiana at age 14. It was so delicious I took careful note of how it was made (I was a cook even then) but haven't made it until now at age 58. I will make this pie again but will substitute sour cream for the lemon juice. I do use lemon juice in a blueberry crumble cookie bar I make and that's why I thought it would work nicely here but for me it didn't. Live and learn.",
