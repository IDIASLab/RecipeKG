My pork loin was only 3 lbs. so I decided to cook it for 3 hrs initially before adding the sauce. But It wasn't nearly ready so I ended up increasing the temperature to 350 for the next hour when I added the sauce. At the end of that hour the temperature was almost 160 degrees but the roast was soggy looking so I increased the temperature to 425 for 15 minutes to brown it a bit. The sauce was tasty but 2 quarts of chicken stock was too much. I put half that amount and still had a pretty watery sauce. But the taste of rhubarb and apples was excellent. I think with some tweeking this will be a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!",
