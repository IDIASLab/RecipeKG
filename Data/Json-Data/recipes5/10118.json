I actually marinated my chicken a lot longer--about 4 hours--and used the BV in the marinade...

Served over wild rice... will definitely be preparing again! Thanks!",

I also chopped some fresh parsley instead of shallots and put it in the marinade. I let it sit for about an hour. I cooked the chicken on the stove until it was almost done and then I added the marinade to it and let it cook for about 5-10 min longer. At the end I put it in the broiler for a few min on each side to get it a little crunchy on the outside.",
