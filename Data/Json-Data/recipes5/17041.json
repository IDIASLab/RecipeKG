Salt and sugar was balanced well but I'd use a little less nutmeg because its a strong spice.  The mix wasn't dry at all, I think the other reviews must not have put the right amount of butter or they didn't gradually at dry ingredients because I found it very creamy.

I used a dried berry mix (cherries blueberries & raspberries) for the fruit and was generous with the spices. Otherwise exact quantities. I did not find the batter dry at all - I used a Kenmore stand mixer and was careful to add everything in slowly and mixed extensively. The butter was softened too which may be the key. These cookies fresh out of the oven are unbelievably good - just the right amount of salt chewy but not gluey melt in your mouth. The only real change was that mine had to bake for an extra 5 minutes or so (15 total) but keep a close eye - these would not be nice over-done!",
