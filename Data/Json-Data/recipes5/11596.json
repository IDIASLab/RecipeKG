I like that it called for poached chicken, which if poached lightly it never dries out, I did everything exactly as presented,  I had everything in the pantry, plus I was super tired, too tired to try and change anything (which I usually want to do) which saved me from botching the recipe up.  I used the whole jar of Alfredo Sauce even though there were just the two of us, we had it the second night too!  Thank you for sharing...I will too!",
