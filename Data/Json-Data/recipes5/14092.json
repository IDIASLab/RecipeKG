Roast until just slightly charred then toss everything into the blender with the fresh cilantro. If you like a chunkier salsa just use the pulse setting instead of pureeing. I also added a splash of honey to take away some of the bitterness of the tomatillos.",

I added garlic cloves when cooking instead of garlic power and I left out the oil. I also added a one green pepper and added the shallots and cilantro to the food processor raw (instead of cooking with the salsa). I think it gave it a bit more bite and a fresher taste. Overall great recipe --- I will definitely make it again! I served it with rice and corn but honestly it's so versatile and would go on anything.",
