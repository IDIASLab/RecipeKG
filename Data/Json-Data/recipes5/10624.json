I cut the roast into about 6 pieces instead of chunks and browned them, then sauteed the onions and mushrooms then added the merlot and cooked that down.  Put it all in the crockpot for 8 hours on low and it was phenomenal.  Don't skip the browning and reducing of the merlot though.  I added fresh mushrooms with the carrots, celery and thyme sprigs.  I did remove about half the liquid with a ladle after 8 hours and put it in a saucepan on the stove and  thickened it up quite a bit with a  water/flour slurry.  This step was key.  I added the (very thick) mixture back to the crock pot (knowing it would mix in with the remaining liquid), added a bit of salt and several dashes of worcestershire and cooked for another 30 minutes or so.  Beef was so tender and the flavor was just wonderful.  Keeper!",
