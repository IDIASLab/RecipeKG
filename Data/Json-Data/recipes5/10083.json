The date paste helps hold it together nicely and dates are known as nature's candy. No refined sugar except for in the chocolate chips. You could include carob chips or whatever kind of chips your kids like. The dried fruit version is yummy as well!",

I had to substitute apple butter as I didn't have the applesauce on hand last night.  This may have made it sweeter than typical.  They taste amazing!  I love the combination of salty, nutty and sweet.  The coconut and cinnamon also add to the deliciousness.  And they were easy and fun to make!",
