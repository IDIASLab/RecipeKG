I tripled the amount of green beans since it was for a picnic. However I only doubled the bacon and used only one onion for the whole dish (I thought this was plenty of both as I didn't want to overpower the beans). Increasing the water for more beans probably was not necessary as the time it takes to boil off 2 cups of water is about the right amount of time for the beans to get tender. Stirring often will ensure all the beans get their fair share of time in the water. I used a little over 3 cups but wish I hadn't because there was too much liquid left over and I ended up pouring some of that wonderful sauce down the drain. I was concerned about the amount of Worcestershire in the recipe but the brown sugar really toned it down and gave the dish a very good flavor. Just a hint of sweetness was a nice compliment to the saltiness of the bacon and the bite in the Worcestershire. The recipe was a hit - everyone wanted to know what that unique flavor was.",

Next time I will only add one cup of water. Also I'm not crazy about soggy bacon. I will also remove the bacon after it crisps and put it back in at the end. The flavor should still be there if you saute the onion and garlic in the bacon grease. Maybe then I can give the recipe 5 stars because the flavor is definitely there.",
