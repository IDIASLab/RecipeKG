In order not to waste egg yolks and to save time, I like to use a carton of liquid egg whites. Egg whites tend to be rubbery, so adding in the cottage cheese helps make them creamier. You can store extras in the freezer and reheat as needed.",

Instead, I was looking to create a low fat breakfast option that was both portable and easy to reheat during the week.  Feel free to swap out the veggies, cheese and herbs for different flavor combinations. Enjoy!",
