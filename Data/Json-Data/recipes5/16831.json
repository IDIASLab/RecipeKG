I would suggest the amount of milk listed be changed to what your pudding box calls for not 3 cups. I did a little less than the box suggested to be thicker for pie and that was less than 2 cups. There is no cooking of the filling as one reviewer was worried about I think in number 2 it should read:...as directed for a pie CHILL for 5 minutes (vs cool as is written). I did have a little panic moment in #3 where it says to spread the reserved mixture over the nuts because that already happened. This would now be top layer over the first layer of pudding. I m sure that s what the writer meant at least that s what I did and it turned out fine. I had extra ingredients so I put some puff pastry in a muffin tray baked them and thenmade some mini versions according to the above order. I preferred them this way. It s a winner for sweet tooths!",
