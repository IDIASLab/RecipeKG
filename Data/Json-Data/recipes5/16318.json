My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was the amount of time it took to prep and the lack of flavor!  There needs to be a definite increase in the spices and I used a double strength chicken broth.  I'm not sure what would have happened had I used regular, but it wouldn't have helped.  So, if you are great with spicing things up to your taste, this would be great.  If you are more of a beginning cook, this might be a little  too much of a challenge without additional spices broken down in the recipe.",
