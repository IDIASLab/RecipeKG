You don't cook the chickpeas, only soak overnight and then grind, this makes a real difference in the outcome. I have made with and w/o potato, no difference.  I am not familiar with cilantro in falafel (so I didn't try it), we only use fresh parsley in the middle east,  and another teaspoon of cumin was needed for our tastes. I also use an additional 2 tablespoons of flour to help it hold together well. And all falafel here is served with a tasty tahina (sesame seed paste) sauce.  Here it goes: 1 small clove garlic, crushed with a mortar and pestle (or forget the mortar like I do and just squash it up in the bowl with the pestle)1/2 of a juicy lemon, about 1/4 cup tahina (you can find tahina in the specialty aisle) 1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste and a couple of tablespoons of room temp water.  Whisk together, adding more water if needed until it is a drizzling consistency. Drizzle over falafel or use in falafel sandwiches. Enjoy and thank you for a good recipe.",

I have used another recipe for years, but it always had a raw bean flavor which this recipe doesn't have.  I baked these instead of frying.  I dropped them from a rounded teaspoon onto a parchment lined baking pan, covered with foil and baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  I then uncovered and turned them, and returned them to the oven uncovered for another 15 minutes.  Very tasty wrapped in an untraditional tortilla with sprouts and tomatoes and cucumbers and a vegan thousand island too!",

You can also bake these in the oven like others suggest: I preheat to 400F or 200C, oil the sheet, spoon and shape then bake 10-15 min on each side (depends on the oven). Don't be scared off by the vegan label. It's the best falafel recipe on this website, and it's the only one I use.",

I kept everything else in the recipe the same except I added an extra teaspoon of cumin and only added one teaspoon salt I used parsley instead of cilantro and I omitted the potato. I didn't have any flour in the house so I used cornmeal instead. I fried them up in my cast iron skillet and they were great. I tried baking some too but frying them definitely tastes better. I also kept them in the fridge for a day and a half instead of the two hours (I was going to make them earlier but got too busy so made them the next day). The great thing about that is that you can prepare these ahead of time and they still turn out great! My boyfriend also loved them and said it was better than the falafel at this Lebanese restaurant we frequent! This recipe is definitely a keeper!",

                "reviewBody": "End product is pretty good but there are some major problems with the amounts of ingredients called for. The garbanzos potato and onion makes a huge amount of falafel but the recipe only calls for 1 tsp. of cumin? I quadrupled the amount of cumin and doubled most of the other spices (except the salt; it was plenty). Also doubled the flour and added bread crumbs and it was still quite loose. I baked though and the end product consistency was good. Would probably be four stars otherwise but as is the recipe has flaws that must be addressed when making.",
