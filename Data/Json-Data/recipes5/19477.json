Typical of most slow cooking a lot of liquid/fat was released into the cooking liquid so it didn't have the strong Asian flavor of the beginning marinade and was actually rather thin and boring. Since I like to serve some the liquid over the meat or with rice, noodles, etc. I think next time I will make extra marinade to set aside and add it near the end to about 1/4 of the cooking liquid.

I didn't have lime juice so used lemon instead, and I didn't have Sriracha sauce so I used 1/2 tsp of hot pepper flakes.  I marinaded for only 3 hours and then cooked in the oven at 350 for 1 hours (I didn't know I had to marinade it until I was getting to make it for today).  It was delicious!  My daughter, who just turned two, asked for more after she finished her plate.  It probably could have been marinaded a bit longer, but I put leftover marinade juice on the meat (I should also note that I only used 3 boneless meat for the entire marinade).  The meat was still tender (not like crock pot tender but tender enough), but  I thought it was a little salty so I'll use less soy sauce next time.  Overall, it was fabulous!",

Didnt have fresh ginger so used ground ginger powder and crushed red pepper (didnt have or know what Sriracha hot pepper sauce)and only used all olive oil--didnt have sesame oil. But we LOVED IT!! and will definitly make again!! Cooked on low for 7 hours and it was just falling apart! Made veggie fried rice to go with and the sauce blended with it and made it that much better! Going to try with chuck roast!",

The second time I made it I switched recipe amounts of olive oil and sesame oil just because the sesame oil seemed a little bit strong the first time around.  I also had to decrease the cooking time by an hour, and that actually worked better for my slow cooker.  These are so yummy, I found myself eating them cold right out of the fridge the next day!  I served them with rice and roasted asparagus.",
