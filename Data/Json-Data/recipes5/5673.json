Pre-cubed the chicken and let it sit for half an hour with olive oil salt garlic powder pepper crushed red pepper flakes and Italian herb mix - all to taste. Started by sauteing the onion and bacon together. Did not remove the onion and bacon I just added the chicken to it. After the chicken had started to cook and separate into cubes I added just enough chicken stock and about a teaspoon of tomato paste - to get all the tasty stuff off the bottom of the pan. Once chicken was cooked I removed it to my serving platter. I used the same frying pan it had tasty bits stuck to the bottom again and added the sun-dried tomato and pesto mix and spinach according to instruction. I then added that to the chicken/bacon mixture. Last I added about a 1/4 cup of a chianti and chicken stock mix to the pan to get the good stuff up then poured that over the chicken as well. I followed the rest of the directions for the sauce as the recipe says. Took three pans not six as the recipe implies. Husband says he likes it had seconds:-) Enjoy.",

When they were done I cooked the chicken (used boneless thighs instead) and then added everything else (up to making the sauce) right into that pot. I used swiss chard from my garden instead of spinach. I made the pasta and then added that to the chicken. Kept the sauce separate at first because the chicken/pasta was wonderful on its own. Gave everyone the option of putting the sauce on it if they wanted. But the sauce was very good and in the end mixed everything together! I will make this again.",
