I ended up doing a gingerbread spice version, which is chef-speak for pumpkin spice, but the fun part is getting to flavor these any way you like! To guarantee the perfect ganache, use a scale to make sure you match 60% of the chocolate's weight in cream.",

Perfect ganache. The whole thing came out perfect (including the spice addition). I used a pair of plastic forks with the center tines snapped out as dipping tools, as seen in someone else's video, and those worked a treat.",

I didn t see anywhere that it had to be dark the recipe said we could make substitutions and we prefer milk chocolate. The ganache was not very thick. I had to keep them in the freezer all night and I was able to roll them into balls but they soon flattened and started softening. I m going to put everything back into the bowl and remelt the ganache and use it like a fondu. If the milk chocolate is the reason this didn t work for me should I be using a different percentage of cream or does it have to be dark chocolate? I really want this to work for me.",
