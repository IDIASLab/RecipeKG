When I tasted it, it was a very savory taste as opposed to a sweet and sour taste you would expect.  I sprinkled sugar over it and kept mixing it in until it tasted the way I liked it.  It worked very well.\n\nSome reviewers have commented that it is too oily.  I used a large bag of cabbage and a small bag of salad mix.  It was not oily at all this way.  IF you are afraid it might be too oily for you, add a little dressing at a time to suit your taste.\n\nOverall, a tasty and easy salad!\n\nP.S.  So I'm eating this salad and thinking to myself, \"Gee, I wonder if adding mandarine oranges would be good?\".  So I frantically look through the cupboard for oranges and to my dismay there are none.  However, there is a can of pineapple.  So I added a whole can plus some juice, and wow!  This is now a FIVE STAR SALAD!!!",
