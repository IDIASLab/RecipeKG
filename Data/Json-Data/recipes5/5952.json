My grocery store didn't have yellow squash so i used zucchini instead. I used a little more olive oil than half and with the lemon added 2 teaspoons of Greek seasoning and olives everything else i kept the same and it was Wonderful! It was hard not to eat it right away..but i put it in the fridge until supper. I served this as a side but could very easily be a meal. I am looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. You can pretty much add anything you have in your fridge and this would taste great. This will make an excellent different side during summer BBQ's maybe next time i will incorporate some fresh herb such as basil from my garden.:)",

I'd suggest  following package instructions for cooking each grain and using the shortest time recommended so that you get some texture with each bite.  I also substitute a yellow bell pepper for the yellow squash (not a fan of that particular squash), and added some cherry tomatoes that I cut in half.  It was a beautiful, delicious salad.
