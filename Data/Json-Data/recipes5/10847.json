I probably wouldn't make it again because I like cheese with every bite which made it very rich. I ended up not having room for the main coarse of my dinner for a soup that wasn't necessarily my favorite. But hey! I tried it right!? Be adventurous! You should try it too I think you might be pleasantly surprised! The only thing I recommend is to cut the recipe in half so you don't have so much left over -- It goes bad fairly quickly.
