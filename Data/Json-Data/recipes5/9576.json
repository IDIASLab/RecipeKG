Still, I think this recipe is pretty forgiving and you can add or subtract to your taste.  This was just what I was looking for to start me on my way to my new favorite soup.  I also loved how quickly everything cooked.  ",

The variation in the potato size allows the thinly sliced potatoes to cook down and thicken the broth; a mix of hot and mild sausage gives the soup more \"zip\", and last, use low sodium chicken broth.   Serve with hot crusty bread for a great meal.",

You can substitute cauliflower for the potatoes for a lower carb diet and it is just as delicious.  Definately just crumble the bacon instead of cutting into pieces.

                "reviewBody": "Excellent!! I've tried other recipes that were supposed to be \"exactly like\" the restaurant version... but none have ever come out the way I expected - until now.  However, I did use kale, not spinach, and I added fennel seed as someone else suggested (thank you). I chopped the fennel seed (about 1.5 tsp) and added it in with the chicken broth (I forgot to add it while cooking the sausage).  I added two big handfuls of chopped kale after adding the cream. Also, I used one 48oz can of chicken broth, and one 14oz can of chicken broth with roasted garlic (I still used the garlic called for in the recipe - and probably a little extra since we like garlic).  If I would change anything next time, I would use less sausage (I used 18oz).  I would only use 10-12oz next time (at the most).  Also, I used 3 very large potatoes (not the huge bakers, but very large), but I don't think it was enough. We like a lot of potatoes.  Also, I wouldn't slice them too thin. Chop them large enough to get a little beat up while stirring/cooking but still remain chunky. I sliced mine about 1/2\" thick, then cut the slices in half, but I wish I had just used bigger chunks instead of slices.  They didn't take 20 minutes to cook this way so watch your potatoes closely, they may be mushy if you let them cook for the full 20 minutes. (Mine were good at 15 min). One last note - I don't think you really need a full cup of cream. You could survive with 3/4 c. & not miss the fat or any of the taste. ",

I had to tweak it a little, but that's ok, I always tweak whatever recipe I look at... a full pound of sausage was a bit much for me so I used a half a pound, and make sure you blot all the grease from the sausage or it will float to the top. Instead of spinach I used kale, it's a heartier green and doesn't wilt in the soup, the texture stays firm for a long time. Delicious!!",

I can handle a lot of salt in my food and this was too salty even for me. I added extra cream just to try and tone down some of the saltiness. Maybe it might be better with reduced sodium ingredients but I will not be making this again. Thanks anyways!",
