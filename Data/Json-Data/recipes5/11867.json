        "description": "For me, there aren't too many things more enjoyable than heading to Northern Ontario with my son and doing some partridge hunting. I think any hunter who's been lucky enough to have had this experience with their son (or good buddies) would agree. The crisp, fresh smell of fall and walking the trails is great. But, now that you've got a grouse or two, do it justice and cook it well. After a few years of looking for a good way to cook these birds I think I've found a winner, thanks to an old Northerner at the Kenogami Bridge Inn. Serve on rice or mashed potatoes.",
