But it's worth it!;) I made this and then boiled some pasta (whole wheat rotini and mini penne) and mixed the pesto with the pasta right after draining. (I used 8 oz. pasta and most of the pesto sauce with it- probably have a little over 1/2 cup leftover). I'll probably use the extra as a dip. I used jarred artichokes and omitted the canola oil. In it's place I added 1/4 cup water mixed with a tiny dab of \"Better than Boullion\". Then I added one large spoonful of the oil from the marinated artichokes I used. I mixed everything in the food processor- adding the artichokes and cheese after everything else was smooth so that I could leave them semi-chunky. I also used basil instead of cilantro- I had it on hand. And I used the juice of 2 lemons. This was easy different and tasted great! We had the pesto pasta with broccoli and breadsticks.",
