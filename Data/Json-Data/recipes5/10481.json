I couldn't figure out what to make for dinner tonight (didn't thaw anything) so we went out and got a pound of hamburger and fired up the grill. I used hoagie style rolls as I wasn't able to find extra-long hot dog buns. These were great and really hit the spot. We poured a little beer over these while they were cooking (an old trick from my Dad) added some pickles and a side of kettle cooked chips as well as  a couple of beers which were a lot easier to drink with the \"free hand\" - Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!",

Essentially, these are just burger shaped dogs, lol, but they were yummy and I would def make them again! Thanks for sharing. :)",

It\u2019s a testament to American ingenuity and being close to the right place at the right time. While I\u2019m posting this as a fun, 4th of July grilling idea, my real motivation is to tell this \u201conly in America\u201d story of food stand stardom.  As the story goes, Bill \u201cBurger Bill\u201d Parrish didn\u2019t want to buy two different kinds of buns for his tiny snack stand, which he operated on Lake Merced, near the Olympic Club in San Francisco. Since there\u2019s no such thing as flat, round hot dogs, Bill decided to shape his burgers to fit the hot dog bun, and The City\u2019s most storied cheeseburger was born. The course is only open to members, so the only way to taste one of these rare beauties is if you\u2019re invited to play as a guest. I\u2019ve had the pleasure twice, and both times the burger experience was just as memorable as the golf. They really are brilliant. Above and beyond fitting the uni-bun, Burger Bill\u2019s rectangular meat ended up being culinary superior for all the reasons I brag about in the video. The shape insures a great crust of grill marks, and a perfect meat-to-bun ratio as you eat your way down the length.",
