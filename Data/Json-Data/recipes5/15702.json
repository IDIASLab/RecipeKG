I scaled it down to 3 servings and while preparing it I accidentally grabbed the beef broth instead of chicken broth so it was not quite a white chili in appearance.

Not quite thick enough.\" I had cooked and shredded 4 bone-in chicken breasts in my crockpot and saved the broth so I used the 2 cups of chicken from that along w/ the leftover stock. (Surprised at the addition of crushed tomatoes as the white chilis that I've always made mostly consist of chicken hominy white beans and spices and no \"red\" ingredients.) Also used 2 cans Great Northern 1 can Cannelini as I wasn't familiar w/ 48 oz. jars of beans. Threw in a half-empty bag of frozen corn and\"Taco Seasoning I\" instead of packets and well this was a pretty awesome chili buuuut it was too watery/more soup consistency than I'd have liked but still tasty nonetheless.",
