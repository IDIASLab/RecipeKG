I changed the marinade just a little - first of all I doubled it, and I used olive oil instead of butter.  I also used honey instead of brown sugar and added a couple of extra garlic cloves.  I used the garlic press instead of a knife for the garlic because I like the way pressed garlic works in a marinade.  I grilled my halibut on a stovetop grill, 5 minutes on the first side and 4 on the second, and I boiled the leftover marinade to drizzle over the fish on the plate.  We loved it and I will make it again.  I'll probably use this marinade on a slightly less expensive fish - here in NY the halibut cost $15.99 lb, so, it was a bit pricey.  But what a gorgeous fish steak!  Thanks.",

I think the butter flavor is essential so rather than substituting oil for butter I just melted the butter and allowed it to sit in the marinade before adding the Halibut.  Of course it thickened up again, but once the Halibut was on the grill, it just melted into the fish.  My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  Thank you!",
