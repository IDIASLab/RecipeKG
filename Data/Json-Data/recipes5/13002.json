I made the directions to serve 16 so the recipe asked for 4 packages of ranch mix. This made me a little nervous so I added only two at first. I changed the green olives to sliced black olives and added sliced carrots. I made the salad the night before and when I checked it in the morning the dressing was slightly thick and I thought it could handle one more package of ranch. I whisked the ranch into 1/2 of milk and this did the trick. Everyone at the BBQ loved it and there was enough for leftovers which made me happy!! I will make this again with my changes as well as main dish and add the chicken (not canned though) to see how it is that way. Thank you for the great recipe!!!",

Definitely heed the advice about letting it sit overnight though. I had to test when it was first made and have to say I was not impressed but once it sat yummy!",
