The ditalini goes in for the last 15 minutes, and honestly, the soup was very liquid-y at that point.  But the pasta soaked up a lot of the broth, and the soup ended up with just about perfect consistency.  Very tasty soup, definitely would make again.  Thanks for submitting your recipe Stephen Williams, we enjoyed it!",
