I didn't lay it on a bed of onions since my boyfriend and I aren't big fans of onion but instead I used small white potatoes. They were quite tasty. All and all I would make this again. Also just remember the safe internal temp of a rabbit should be 160*F so I would use a meat thermometer and use hat as a reference for when it is done.",

Things I did differently: my rabbit was already pieced out and not whole and had been soaked in a salt brine overnight (I did this before deciding on what recipe I should use). I substituted coriander for cumin since I didn't have any cumin on hand (and am not a fan of it anyway) and a yellow onion for red onion since I can't eat red onions. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This came out nice and moist something that's hard to get with rabbits and I didn't have any problems with it being over or under cooked. This is one of the easier rabbit recipes I've found and I'll definitely be making it again! Goes great with a salad or other greens. The smell will have your mouth watering. It's great the next day too!",
