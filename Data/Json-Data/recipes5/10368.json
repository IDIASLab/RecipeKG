I made a couple modifications...Dungeness crab is super expensive so I used 1/2 crab and 1/2 smoked salmon. Oh my goodness, this was a super fabulous idea. I might make this with only smoked salmon next time because we loved the subtle smoky flavor it brought to the dish. Aside from this, I followed the recipe to a \"T\". I will most definitely be making this one again and again! Thanks Chef John and Allrecipes!!",

I did not have large ramekins and personally did not care for the \"overflowing\" presentation. Instead, I used two - 12 oz square (4.75 x4.75) Corningware dishes. The plus side to this was it gave the bread pudding more surface area for crunch and the eggs and hollandaise stayed contained within the dish, making eating much easier. After 20 minutes at 400 degrees my pudding was still a tad moist so I just place it under the broiler till dry (about 1 minute). I used the Blender Hollandaise Sauce also found in AllRecipes. Nice combinations of flavors and a new favorite for breakfast.",
