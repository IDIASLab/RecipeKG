Sometimes I have 4 ppl, sometimes 6 or 8ppl. Shrimp cooks real fast & if using pre-cooked shrimp you just have to heat it through. Will definitely be making this again, especially on nights too hot to cook on grill.",

I had fresh pasta on hand, I made it yesterday, so I used that. We're in \"stay at home\" due to Covid-19 and I didn't have Asiago so I used shaved parmesan.  This is a really quick recipe but it needs some acid, maybe lemon zest? If I make this again I will add the fresh basil at the end, uncooked, as the flavour doesn't seem to come through.
