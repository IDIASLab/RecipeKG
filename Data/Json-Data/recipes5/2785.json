It is definitely good enough for us to eat it for lunch several days in a row. I am not sure how this turned out soupy for other reviewers as mine actually needed extra water and still came out fairly thick and stewy. The secret may be in the cooking time I did let mine simmer for over an hour as the recipe suggests. I had to use bone-in tights as that was the only thing left in the shop but I think that actually added to the flavour. Picked the bones out once the meat was soft. I added some extra tomato puree and lots of garlic powder to compliment the spinach and I think the lemon is a key ingredient - add plenty. Very nice on rice and loved it on mash.",

I used only about half or three quarters as much chicken and more spinach and parsley. I also added garlic for fragrance before frying the spinach and parsley. I chopped the chicken breast into smaller pieces after the first 10-minute boiling period. The lemon (I used the juice of an entire lime instead of measuring) gives the soup a freshness and most of its flavor. If you're worried about blandness as one review complained then taste the soup and adjust it for saltiness before adding the lemon juice. Besides the obvious of adding more tomato paste turmeric and salt you can also add chicken bouillon powder at that point. Cut up mushrooms would be a very good addition to this soup too. Calling it a stew is a little misleading. There's very little liquid and it's more broth-like than stew-like.",
