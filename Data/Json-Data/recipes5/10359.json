I didn't have any thyme so I just left it out but I added minced garlic to the marinade and stuffed the chicken with half a lemon half an onion and a few garlic cloves before tying the legs together. I also added 3 cut up russet potatoes to the bottom of the pan to cook with the chicken and then stirred them every time I took the chicken out. The potatoes were absolutely delicious! They soaked up everything that was good about the chicken marinade and came out a little tangy and super savory. Next time I'll have to adjust the cooking time though the chicken was just a tad too pink after we cut it open.",
