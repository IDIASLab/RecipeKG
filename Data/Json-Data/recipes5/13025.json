It is called 'Tortilla Soup' but no tortillas?\" Had to chuckle at preparing this recipe that there were no tortillas (corn flour chip or otherwise) in the ingredient list so lazy me just tossed some chips on at the end. I've just noticed too that I completely missed the cream of chicken soup for which I feel bad for even reviewing this b/c I think w/ or w/o it the soup's flavor and texture would change quite a bit. (IMHO I'm glad I forgot it.) Random rant - I dislike recipes w/o nice even serving sizes that I can calculate down by half. What's w/ the 5? So I eyeballed the ingredient list and scaled it to the best of my poor mathematically-challenged brain. Sauted the onion w/ bell pepper (no banana) and garlic cloves (yuck garlic powder) and tossed everything in the crock pot b4 leaving for work. Left on low for about 8 hrs. and it was good but just too mild for our taste. After adding extra hot sauce cheese cilantro (fresh) and of course TORTILLA chips it was a good soup that I'll make again; the best parts were the chick peas and the fact that my 3-year old demolished her whole bowl.",

I did 1.5c water chicken bullion 1 can cream of chicken 1 can of chicken 1 can of black beans frozen corn sauted onions 1 can of Rotel tomatoes Adobo seasoning Cumin Garlic and Pepper to taste. Topped with sour cream cheese avacado and grilled tortillas.

I also used corn instead of hominy and added Basmati rice. My family likes a very hearty soup so this helped give it more substance. Flavor is excellent! Thank you for the recipe!",

I didn't have black beans when I made this so I subbed with kidney beans. I also subbed canned corn for the hominy and did not add the banana pepper. I think it would be even better as written. The only change I will keep in the future is subbing all natural chicken broth for the water and bullion cubes. Cuts down on the salt and tastes even better. Overall a great recipe.
