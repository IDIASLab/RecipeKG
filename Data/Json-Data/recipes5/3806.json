I made this with kalamata (Greek) olives, in order to attempt to duplicate the Grill's version, and it was pretty darn close!  I normally, er, mess with recipes a great deal, adding extra seasonings, etc., but I didn't add anything to this, except some saut\u00e9ed baby portabella mushrooms that I needed to get rid of.  This was very fast and simple to make, and quite delicious - even vegetarian.  My (carnivore) husband raved!",
