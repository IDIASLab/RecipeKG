This recipe was a little out of my comfort zone so I'm having a difficult time reviewing it:) It was good-you can definately taste the raspberry but it's not over-powering. It was pretty spicy-not belly-burning spicy but lips burning kinda spicy. Might want to tone down the spice if kids will be eating it! Also it makes a ton! I halved the recipe & made 6 huge country style ribs & ended up w/about 2 cups of sauce leftover! Probably won't make it again but it was fun to try!! Thank you!",

We use it for BBQ sauce and/or dipping bbq'd or baked beef ribs pork fish or chicken. Our grown kids wait for the next batch...I'm on my 3rd time around! BTW it's also good over cream cheese and eaten w/crackers tortilla chips and/or sliced fruits like pears. Beautiful color. I kept true to the recipe flavors but used 2 TB finely diced fresh onion instead of dried and added 2 TB balsamic to the required vinegar for a darker appearance. If you are canning don't reduce the acid called for...pickle jc./vinegar etc. as it's necessary for safe canning. Love the stuff! Thank you A.K. for this amazing recipe!",

I think I might try making it with different preserves too to see if I can get maybe a blueberry blackberry strawberry or even fig flavor. We'll see what works. After the sauce was done I turned the heat back up to medium-high. I threw in six chicken breasts with salt and pepper on them and boiled those for about 20 minutes or so then I pulled them out shredded them and threw them back in. I turned the heat down to low and simmered them another 10 minutes. I served the chicken on a grilled bun. Topped it with Swiss cheese a dill pickle homemade onion rings and some lightly dressed (non-mayonnaise) apple-cabbage coleslaw. Best barbecue chicken sandwich I've ever had.",
