This recipe, however, allows the nice flavor of the fish to be tasted.  My suggestion is to just brush the fish with lemon juice (as the recipe instructs) - don't marinade.  Then simply sprinkle the fish with dill weed and lemon pepper, maybe a little salt and then cook or grill - don't worry about measuring the ingrediants.  Serve with rice and steamed veggies.  Enjoy!",

Just squeeze on some lemon juice, dill & lemon pepper & throw it on the grill right away.
