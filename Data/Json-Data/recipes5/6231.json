It is a light and fresh accent to your pastry; not too sweet and not too tart. I was weary about the butter giving it too much butter flavour, but it doesn't. No one particular flavour overpowers this. I suggest adding the milk at the end of your mixing little-by-little as you need to judge the consistency you want. If you want a glaze, then add more milk, if you want a frosting then add less. The amount of lemon is right on. Thank you Dwight E for the recipe.",
