Just be sure to use a nice Port and not a cheap brand as the cheap ones tend to have a sour bitterness to them. These are good shippers too which is important to me as my family lives 3000 miles away. I suggest however that you wrap each square in plastic wrap or waxed paper before shipping as they are so moist they may crumble in transit.",

I am so glad your recipe was here because I made some and I'm taking them to my son's place for Christmas eve. I recommend using an inexpensive tawny port wine because I think it is more mellow and more black-cherry-like than the plain port wine. Try to chop the walnuts really fine or buy the finely diced walnuts to save time. This is my favorite Christmas cookie of all. Not chewy to me... more like a moist piece of cake. They should be cut in small pieces because they are rich. Great recipe. Thanks for providing it here.",

These were impossible to serve as bars since they just crumbled into pieces when I tried to cut them. I took the crumbles and filled mini muffin cups and froze them. Popped them out and put them into a freezer bag. I also scraped off as much of the frosting as I could as it was an unappetizing Pepto Bismol color. I will serve them in custard cups with a warm caramel sauce and hope for the best.",
