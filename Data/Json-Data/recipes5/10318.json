Not nothin' else ... and you'll have the taste just like the originals from The Anchor Bar in Buffalo NY.  And, just like Chef John says, butter is what you use ... not margarine.  You should never buy store-bought wing sauce (waste of money, bad taste, and this stuff is soooo easy to make!).  \nSuggestions:\n- Omit the cayenne if you want your wings mild-to-medium-hot, 1/4 tsp as listed if you want it medium-hot, and, well, you get the idea.   \n- Skip the extra salt (absolutely not necessary as all bottled hot sauce is incredibly salty anyway)\n- Keep the sauce warm on the stove, and toss your hot-out-of-the-oven wings in a good amount of warmed hot-sauce, serve immediately\n- Do not put these back in the oven to \"dry\" the sauce ... they're supposed to be saucy.  \n- Keep some extra warmed hot sauce on the table for dipping (for those of us that need more hot-sauce punishment!)\n- Lastly, serve with a real home-made blue cheese dressing, as there are several good ones on this site (choose one with less mayo-to-sour cream ratio) ... and don't forget the celery & carrot sticks to garnish for a crunch & cooling effect!  \nThanks for a great recipe, Chef John.",

I deep fried the wings in peanut oil (355 degrees) in batches, then tossed all of the wings in the sauce - give em a good shake - with the lid on of course.

I followed the rest of recipe exactly and it was so creamy and good! Then I did add a little more pepper and garlic after I made the original recipe just because we like more heat. Loved the flour roux idea and will always make my sauce creamy like this forever and because of the roux the butter doesn't separate out as easily.",

One thing that wasn't included in the directions, which I found relevant: As soon as I removed the sauce from the heat and the boil died down, the sauce began to separate. So when I was ready to use it, I returned it to the heat, brought back to a boil, pulled it, and quickly tossed the chicken before it had a chance to separate again.",

First I baked the wings by lightly coating them in flour, set in fridge for an hour (to dry them from washing) and then cooked in oven at 400 degrees for an hour. Then you coat this sauce onto wings by shaking them and the sauce in a popcorn bowl with a plate on top.  I am from Buffalo and I eat at the anchor bar. If this isn't the recipe, you are fooling me. These are perfect and so delicious...especially if you eat them hot.",
