I didn't have any craisins so I coursely chopped a cup or so of fresh cranberries added 2 - 3 TBS of white sugar and put in the microwave for 30 seconds then added to the dry ingredients and it worked just fine. I was low on some other ingredients too so I borrowed several ideas from the reviewers used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour didn't have orange zest so used 3/4 c orange juice and 1/4 milk substituted butter for the shortening. Also made the glaze from Ann's review orange juice and powdered sugar which was the perfect finishing touch for us. One more thing was I reduced the amount of wheat germ to a 1/4 cup and added a 1/4 of ground flax seed and I couldn't tell the difference. Will definitely make again and maybe try other berries and juice combinations like possibly blueberry and lemon.",

It is a simple recipe that yields really spectacular flavor and texture. I did not have OJ so I used more milk. I didn't have orange zest so I used 2 Tbs of orange extract which was more than plenty. I also used the orange-essence dried cranberries. I did substitute wheat bran for the wheat germ and opted for 1/2 white flour 1/2 whole wheat flour. The texture was fantastic flavor wonderful.

The 4tsp. of baking powder give it a true biscuit taste along with the Pastry flour being lighter then reg. whole wheat. A new staple. I am looking to expand with other ingredients.Skip the butter on top. They remain moist at least until the next day (if they last that long) and they are pretty much fat free. For a scone that is amazing in itself.",
