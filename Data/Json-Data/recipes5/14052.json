I'd add more salt and pepper to the veggies as by the time everything had baked it needed more. Also. a little more heat.. perhaps I got a mild jalapeno? I used a Mexican cheese blend instead of two different cheese and it came out fine. I really liked this idea of using broccoli as the main component of this dish. Did I miss the meat? Maybe a little.. Last thing.. this tasted better the next day so make a day in advance if you can.. flavors meld",
