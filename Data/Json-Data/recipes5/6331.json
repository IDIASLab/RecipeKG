This is like eye candy when presented in a warmed ramekin dish with some chopped parsley and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese added to the top.  Hubby says this is his favorite scampi and better than any he gets at an upscale restaurant.",

Also, I would cook the pasta and toss it with the sauce so that the delicious sauce covers every bite.  \nI cooked raw shrimp in butter and garlic, removed and then continued on with the recipe.  Add the shrimp and pasta in at the end.  Delicious.  \nA few added pepper flakes to step this up a notch.  A solid recipe - thank you.",
