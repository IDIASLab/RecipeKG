My daughter-in-law and I made 3 of them a month ago. We waited a month to eat any. It is so moist and very spicey. I brushed on a little brandy every other day for about the first 10 days after baking then just left it wrapped. Even family members who questioned why we would make a fruitcake liked this one. Wonderful!",

The flavor was ok but it just didn't turn out the way I expected. Fruitcakes are costly to make & I just expected 'better'. Maybe I'll have better luck with a different recipe. Since I LOVE fruitcake I might try again...& maybe I'll have better luck next time. The brandy everyday for 2 weeks? Way too much too soggy...but I'll try again next year maybe.",
