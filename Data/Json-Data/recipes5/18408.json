No doubt it's a pretty muffin with a very attractive and tasty topping and just the right amount of sweetness. However, unless you're a big fan of nutmeg, either reduce the amount to a mere dash or eliminate it altogether--I tasted it a little more than I liked and found it distracting. At the same time, I found the rhubarb a little lacking, so I would definitely recommend increasing it to 1-1/2 cups.",

I used all whole-wheat flour (I'm usually leery of doing this; in general, I replace only half or a little more of the amount of white flour with whole wheat. But I used white whole wheat; maybe that made a difference.) I also skipped the topping, but included the cinnamon & nutmeg in the dry ingredients. And I did 3T of canola oil & only 1T of butter. The only change I'd consider next time is in the spices: I thought the nutmeg flavor was a little too strong, so I think next time I'll cut it back a little. If it still needs tweaking, I might increase the cinnamon. Also, be prepared for very dry batter--I would have been nervous about that if I hadn't already read here about it. I will definitely make these again. My kids loved them too.",
