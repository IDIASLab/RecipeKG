I don't think I would have cared for any more onion anyway. I soaked vegetables in two changes of cold water rinsed gently with sprayer then allowed to drain for about 30 minutes while I got the jars and so forth ready. I don't care for very much dry mustard so reduced it to 1 tsp. I know they will have better flavor in a couple of weeks but I went ahead and tasted them. I think these are some of the best (what I classify as bread n butter) sweet pickles I have made or eaten. (I have been gardening and canning for about 30 years just to put perspective on it.)
