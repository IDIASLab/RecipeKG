My husband and I are no longer wheat-consumers due to allergies so I used rice pasta instead which worked out really well I couldn't even tell the difference. I thought a cup of olive oil was a bit too much so I used less but I think next time I will use the whole cup--the olive oil not only adds moisture but some of the flavor it was missing as well. This salad might be even more interesting with some chopped olives thrown in and maybe a little bit of chopped onion. All in all this is a recipe I'll definitely make again--it was quick easy was satisfying and made at least 4-6 servings which surprised me.",

I didn't have broccoli so I saut\u00e9ed a zucchini instead; I also added a chopped tomato and half a can of chick peas and a bit of chopped onion. I couldn't believe that a cup of olive oil wouldn't be too much so I only used a half but I think next time I will try a cup. This made a huge bowl of pasta salad and the dressing was readily absorbed. It was still good though with half the oil so suit yourself. Nice with a good grated cheese on top. This is a very flexible recipe. Thanks!",

I also omitted the soy sauce (because I forgot it) lightly steamed the veggies before adding used only 1/4 olive oil and used lemon-infused white balsamic vinegar in place of the red and lemon juice. To punch up the spice I added Italian seasoning and a generous amount of Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb blend. Finally I topped each serving with sliced grape tomatoes. Super yum!",
