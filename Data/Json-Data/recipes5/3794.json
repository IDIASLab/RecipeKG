I bake this at 375 for 15 min., check on it with a fork (to see if it flakes easily), and follow it up with a few minutes under the broiler.  Perfect every time and as you can tell from my picture, I had no burning!  Served it with another easy but impressive dish \"Colleen's Potato Crescent Rolls.\"  Many people think Pillsbury crescents are the best and should not be substituted ....until they try these. ;)",

Mine took nine minutes the first time and ten the second time.  It depends on how thick the cuts are.  Then return it to the oven for two more minutes.  PERFECT!",

Everytime I make this everyone has to have the recipe. I have not used Halibut, what ever kind of fish you are using should be a more firm fish. I use on stripped bass and it comes out wonderful. I have also tried cod and talapia it work really good too. One thing to keerp in mind if it is a thinner fish broil it for a shorter time. Do not over cook. The other thing I use is fresh grated parmesan. The Kraft bottled parmesan will not work. I can not imagine this being anything but 5 stars. Do not try this on salmon. It has to be a firm white fish.
