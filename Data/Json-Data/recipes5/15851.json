I will try it again with a thinner piece of salmon, as the one I used was really thick and over-powered the flavor of the crust.  The crunchiness of the crust was fantastic, and in the thinner pieces of fish the flavor was wonderful.  I think that this might be better as a marinade, mixed in with some virgin olive oil and allowed to soak the fish for about a half hour or so before cooking, then rolled into the bread crumbs.  I'm going to try it this way next time and will revisit this review then.  Perhaps the 3 star rating will come up a bit.",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I found myself struggling to keep the crust attached to my fillets. I I just used a packet of Taco Bell seasoning & lightly added a pinch of Lawry seas salt prior to breading. If you want to try your salmon in a new way don't pass this one up. It's a keeper!",
