This stuff is sold at just about every authentic Amish restaurant and many roadside markets etc. You put it on bread folks -- just like you would peanut butter or butter. They serve it with white and wheat dinner rolls before your meal comes. It's a sweet spread you put on a roll, bagel, English muffin, whatever -- instead of jam. It's sweet; the Amish have a major sweet tooth. If you love peanut butter and you aren't allergic to something that isn't so good for you every now and again, this is going to ring your bell. Kids love it. My 42 year-old husband loves it. My 67 year-old mother loves it. It's just a nice treat and interesting change from your basic jam/butter/PB and we never leave Amish country without a tub of it. Now we can make it every once in a while at home! I have asked the Amish women how this is made and they told me it has marshmallow cream and corn syrup so I know this recipe is right on.",

I also made a batch where I added carmel ice cream topping and mixed it together. Of course that was certainly used for ice cream sundaes. This is exactly like a spread that is served at an Amish restaurant in Southern Indiana. Thanks for the recipe.",

The consistency if very different then I expected. It is super gooey yet sticky. I am not sure what to put it on either? It seems like it would be like putting a peanut butter dessert on toast? But then again people eat honey and chocolate spreads for breakfast on bread. I did scale the recipe way down though to about 1/4 cup to try it. I bet kids would go crazy over this though!",
