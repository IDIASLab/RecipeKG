I loved the crunch from the celery and instead of just placing this on a plate as a \"salad\" I decided to roll this up inside large tortillas with the romaine lettuce and avocado slices because afterall some chicken salads deserve to be eaten with your hands rather than just a fork!",

I only used half a cup of mayo and added a good deal of Lemon Pepper seasoning and garlic salt...it needs some spicing up.  I've made it twice now and it's much better with diced chicken breast than with canned chicken...it's a better texture.  I also added the avocado to the mixture rather than as a garnish.

This is a beautiful healthy and tasty salad with all its confetti colors and fresh ingredients. Most notable was the avocado and bacon which lent not only great flavor but creaminess and crunch. It's kind of a sedate salad not boldly flavored but I actually found that appealing after heavier meals. I'm not generally a \"salad for supper\" kind of person but served with \"Peppery Cheddar Muffins \" this was quite nice!",
