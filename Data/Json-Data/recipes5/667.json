Some of us have to fiddle with these recipes, and it was no exception in this case.  I added Herbs de Provence to the gravy that took it over the top!  I would also suggest that the beef bouillon is not needed as I think it would overpower the pork flavor.  The chops were moist and tender at 9 minutes per side on a medium gas heat.  All in all, simple and delicious!",

I was out of beef bouillon so I left it out and changed the amount of basil from 1 3/4 tsp. to 1 tsp.  I was afraid it was to much basil for our taste.  I added a dash of onion powder and garlic powder. I ended up adding more milk because the gravy was a little thick.  It tasted great-the pork was tender and juicy.  I will definitely be making it again.  Next time I'll try some diced onion, minced garlic and maybe some mushrooms.",

Not too salty at all. \n- Short on milk,  so used 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half.\n- Only had 3 pork chops so we had extra gravy which was awesome because it is delicious. \n- We cooked the gravy about 2 minutes extra. \nSeriously, this is an AWESOME recipe!",
