I peel and then steam the sweet potatoes for quicker prep and less mess. I use organic dried prunes and stew them in water, then pour off the excess to use the prune juice. I mash the softened prunes with a masher or put them in the food processor briefly. I use a bit less butter and sometimes substitute a bit of stevia for some of the honey. This dish is equally delicious served hot or cold. When served cold, it tastes more like a dessert. Leftovers freeze well. This recipe is in my lifelong \u201cgo to\u201d, tried and true file.",
