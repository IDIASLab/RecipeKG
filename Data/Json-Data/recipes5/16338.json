I have to double the recipe and bake in a bundt pan. It really looks impressive too when turned out on a plate. It looks like you spent hours on it, but it is sooooo easy.(DON'T try tripling it though. It won't get baked through without the outside getting way too dark.)I also increase the cinnamon by 1/2 tsp, the margarine by 1 Tbsp, the brown sugar by 2 Tbsp, and the pecans by 1/4 cup. Otherwise, the topping is too scant for our taste. If you use the extra large biscuits, you'll need to cut them into thirds, and I wouldn't recommend using the large biscuits for both cans (when doubling). It's just too much dough. For my oven, I have to reduce the heat to 415-425 so the outside doesn't over bake before the inside is done. This is a favorite we'll be baking for many years to come!",
