I'd suggest the following:  Cut the chicken into slices rather than cubes to make them bite-size.  Or use chicken tenderloins.  Dredge the chicken pieces lightly in flour before browning, which will help them brown and be a little crispy.  More capers  More lemon juice  Add salt and fresh ground pepper to taste. (yes, that's a given, but some people may need the reminder).  I might add a little white wine to the chicken in the last few minutes of sauteeing.  I wouldn't use extra virgin olive oil, which doesn't hold up well to sauteeing.  Much as I love olive oil and garlic, I wouldn't add it here.",

I used a pound of orzo instead of penne mixed it all together tasted it found it still too bland. I added fresh ground pepper and garlic salt which helped immensely.
