Great recipe with lots of room for experimentation!\n\nI did end up having enough for a lot more than six servings, however.",

I used refried black beans which gave them a good authentic mexican flavor. Also I made the the guacamole and a homemade salsa earlier in the day. The time they chilled in the frige made the flavors come together nicely. My whole family loved these chimis. Will definately become a family favorite. Also I made about 15 chimis by useing the recipie adjuster on the website. Finally as you roll the chimis you will get better at rolling and tucking them tightly. Practice makes perfect.",

There needs to be more seasoning in the preparation of the chicken and the recipe in general. The guac needed lots of salt to taste good. I added a can of died green chilies to the rice mixture while cooking for color & flavor. Would make again with some tweaks, probably some chili powder, cumin, etc. in the whole recipe.",
