It calls for 1/2 cup bow-tie pasta, but I believe that it should be 1 cup uncooked bow-tie pasta, which will yield about 2 cups cooked pasta, which is what the submitter's original recipe called for.  This is what I used, and it was the correct amount, in my opinion. The dressing/mayo amounts are too much as well. I used about a heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise (I did not use vegan mayo) and added some of the Kraft Tuscan House Italian dressing to it in a separate bowl, until it looked like enough to coat the rest of the ingredients. I just eye-balled it, but it was WAY less than what the recipe called for. If I had used 1 cup of each, it would have been swimming it in. With my adjustments, we would give this 4 stars. We liked it, but I just want to caution others on the pasta amount and the dressing amounts.",
