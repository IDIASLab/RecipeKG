This recipe is based on the famous Frango&reg; candy that was sold at the Bon Marche in Seattle, WA. I have substituted other extracts for different flavors. If I want a pretty look, I pipe the chocolate into small candy papers with a pastry tip. The result is a soft smooth chocolate candy.",

The original recipe called for two eggs but I switched to egg substitute (to avoid salmonella poisoning potential in raw eggs) and it still works great. Hope you enjoy this smooth and creamy chocolate treat.",
