I used the ingredients as listed - except no tahini as my store does not sell it.\n\nThe only change I made to prep was a tip I read on another hummus recipe to make a creamier mixture:\nDrain the garbanzo beans and pour them into a bowl of water.  With fingers, gently rub the beans to loosen the hull.  Hulls will float to the top and you can easily scoop them out.  When you've removed them all, drain off the water and use the beans as directed.",

For what it's worth it turned out really good but super spicy. If you like really spice dump the whole can in it's super flavorful. I remade the recipe correctly and I love it.",

The only things I did differently was omitting the roasted peppers and using the liquid from the garbanzos in place of water. That was before I thought of using the water I soaked my homemade sundried tomatoes in. I will try that next time. This is good stuff perfect snack on a hot summer's day. Thanks for posting it I use chipotle and cilantro all the time and would have never thought of adding them to hummus which is another favorite. 5 stars.",

I made a couple of alterations- Instead of 1/2 cup water I used water and a splash of the juice from the bottle of red peppers as well as a healthy dose of the adobo sauce from the chipotle peppers. I used lime as weel as lemon left out the tomato. I used dried cilantro as that is what I had. I tasted it prior to adding the tahini and it was great without although it does add depth to the flavor. You can fiddle with this recipe to suit your taste. It's winner for sure and will be going to our next office party! Thank you for sharing!",

I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight and this morning the flavors had really come through wonderfully--it is delicious! A couple of co-workers have sampled it and also think it is really good. I can already tell this is one I will make again and again. I followed the advice of one poster who said to rinse the beans and get the husks off them and I can see the benefit of doing that.
