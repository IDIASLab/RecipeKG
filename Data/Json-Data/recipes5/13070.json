Just way too much rice!\" Funny that other review says not enough rice, whereas I read 2 cups as insanely too much. Ended up making the rice (1/2 c. brown basmati, non-instant) separately to avoid it being smooshy or crunchy, and just stirring it in when we served the jambalaya. Really delicious, and very, very easy to make!",
