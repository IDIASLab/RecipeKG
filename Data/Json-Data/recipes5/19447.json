The cookie dough were nice little gems to bite into - cause truly I am not a fan of plain chocolate fudge. The fudge itself though has just the right amount of sweetness and doesn't taste like chocolate frosting (big plus.) I had no problem with the amount of flour to make the cookie dough. It turned out just fine. Good recipe thanks for sharing.",
