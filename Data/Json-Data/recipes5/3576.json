My mom made a dish similar to this which is what prompted me to try it. The cashews were fun. I used half light mayo and it turned out perfect. Still creamy. I used about 1/3 of a red onion chopped fine. This along with the celery added beautiful color. I didn't have problems with it being too greasy and I even added the chips (about 1/2 cup). It's common sense that it will be a rich dish though. We all loved it!",
