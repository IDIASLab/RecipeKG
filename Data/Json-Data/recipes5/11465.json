For the lentils I used a small can of condensed lentil soup. That pretty much took care of the spices and both the salt and the oregano werent neccessary. It was thicker than I wanted and still tasted mostly like the canned tomatoes so I added chicken broth until I liked the consistency and the taste. Then I added a couple spoonfuls of tomato paste just because it seemed like a good idea. Made a giant pot and is seriously really tasty. Cant wait to try it again after a day.",
