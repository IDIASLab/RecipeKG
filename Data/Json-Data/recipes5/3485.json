I upped the temp. to 350 and cooked it for another 20 mins or so and it turned out great.  I've made it twice now and the second time I wrapped it in foil and cooked it at 350 and in 25 mins it was done.  I also make extra sauce to put on poatoes or rice because it is sooooo good.  I didn't use salmon I got a really good deal on basa (a white fish) and it was perfect.",

We did this because we had no Dijon mustard in the fridge and it turned out SO great!  I can't brag enough about how insanely delicious this meal is!  We serve it with salad and Lipton Sweet and Sour noodles.  I have to agree with the earlier post regarding using fillets instead of steaks.  We buy the fillets at Sam's/Costco and cut them into small portions and that works just fine for us.  Just make sure you lightly coat the dish with Pam to keep the scales from sticking.",
