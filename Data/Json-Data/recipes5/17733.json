After reading the reviews I adjusted the steps in making the frosting ~ mixed the flour into the brown sugar before adding them to the melted butter, making a roux. Cooled it slightly and whisked in the egg. Cook mixture for three minutes. Remove from heat and add pecans & vanilla. I did use more pecans too ~ 1 1/4 cups. I also exchanged 1/4 cup Amaretta for 1/4 cup of the water called for in cake mix directions and shortend the baking time to avoid the dry texture some reviewers mentioned... and, it turned out beautifuly. Thanks Hillary for this wonderful recipe.",

I could have bought something but everyone is used to home made treats from me. I have to say this was the easiest cake to make and I had all the ingredients on hand already which made it even better. I did decrease the baking time by 10 minutes to combat the dryness others complained about. The cake was perfect. I also did have a little troubel with the praline frosting not thickening enough and most ended up dripping down the side of the cake pan. That is okay though everyone just wanted the edges of the cake. I will sure keep this recipe in mind the next time I don't want to or have time to fix something for a pot luck.",

The only small drawback was that I found that the cake portion seemed a little dry from the double baking time. But this could be easily overcome with possibly less initial baking time or perhaps using another brand of cake or making the cake from a scratch recipe that is more moist. All in all a good recipe and would be great for potluck supper picnics family gatherings etc. It's a great way to make a cake mix cake seem more special---like homemade.",
