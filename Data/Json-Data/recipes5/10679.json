I also added a little bit of marinated artichoke hearts chopped small and was generous with the nutmeg and pepper. Maybe these changes were the key because otherwise I can't understand where the complaints of blandness come. Super flavorful and one of the more tasty things I've found on this site. Will definitely make again!",

I added a half container of ricotta that I had left over and only added 2 cups of sliced leeks because I didn't have time to keep slicing them.  As other reviewers have said, it's a very forgiving recipe and you can add your own vegetables (and I think even meat) to it.  It's a great \"use up certain leftovers\" recipe!  Next time I won't add extra salt and may cut back on the grated cheese.  I thought it was a little salty.  I think you can add other shredded cheeses to it, too.  It's almost like a quiche made with rice.",
