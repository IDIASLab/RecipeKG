Use butter because margarine is sometimes more than half water a difference between 2 teaspoons and 2 Tablespoons of water. If I were going to try something different with this I might replace the butter with coconut or palm grease... crisco is against the law where I live I couldn't bring myself to lard... Just by reading it I knew how it would taste but because it whipped together so easy and got disappeared I gave it 5 stars. But think about it... the cool sensation of decrystallizing micropowdered sugar with the tart of lemon - a not unfamiliar pairing - followed by the feel of a coating of solidified grease and sugar giving way to a carb-crunch of gently salted and sweetened fortified rice... it's really rated-x junk food no doubt.",

I LOVE lemon that just pops, so I made a few tweaks.  \n\nI made a strong 1/2 batch to try it out...5 cups cereal, plus 1/2 the other ingredients, rounding up a little.  I also added about 1/8 t. extra fine salt (found with the popcorn seasonings).  I think salt rounds out almost any dish.  AND, to add a little zing to the coating, I added 3 packets of True Lemon to the powdered sugar.  True Lemon (and lime, and orange) are usually with the juices in the store, or sometimes the tea, or sweeteners.  It really added what I demand from a lemon treat. I used a large (wide) stainless steel bowl for mixing and coating, and didn't bother with a plastic bag.  I also bake my regular Chex mix in that large bowl...all 18-20 cups of it.  Much easier than spreading on sheet pans.  I just bake it about 1/2 hour longer, stirring every 15 minutes.  Thanks, Chex!",
