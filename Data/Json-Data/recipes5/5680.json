Hubs captured it best, however, when he said that he enjoyed this because it was simple.  Exactly!  Because there are so few add-ins, the lovely (and expensive) crab takes center stage.  You KNOW you're eating CRAB salad.  I did add some green peas, but only because this was seriously in need of some color.  It would have looked pretty anemic if I hadn't.  I loved the addition of the chili sauce, which you can't identify but contributed  subtle flavor.  The dill is a fitting addition. I forgot to add the lemon juice, so I can't be certain if this pasta salad is better with or without.   In my view, skip the typical and possible additions of onion, cheddar cheese, green pepper, bacon, tomatoes... all good, but if you want CRAB salad, prepare this just as is.  One other thing - this salad will be as good as the quality of the crab you use.  Buy the best that fits your budget.",

After 24 hours in the fridge the flavor did mellow a bit but I still found the dill overpowering. I did add a cup of frozen peas; and then in an effort to make it more to my liking added some Old Bay seasoning red pepper flakes lemon pepper and some cubed cheddar cheese. I've made other pasta salads with dill that I enjoyed; however in my opinion dill just didn't fit here. It probably only needed some Old Bay instead. I will not make again.",
