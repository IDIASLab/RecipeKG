I had some problems with this one though it could very easily have been my fault somehow which is why I'm giving it a high rating. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine so maybe that's what messed me up? I followed all other directions to the letter and when I removed it from the oven the matzoh had floated to the top! Anyone else have this happen? Also my chocolate chips crystalized from the intense heat so I would recommend a brief cool-off period just in case. This can be a delicious recipe and I wish you better luck than I had! Thanks for posting CC.:)",
