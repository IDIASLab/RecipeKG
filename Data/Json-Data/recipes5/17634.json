You ought to consider changing the name of this sauce to \"The Best Dang Barbeque Sauce Ever\".\n\nWe did cut the garlic in half and omitted the butter as a reviewer suggested.  We also added a tsp of onion powder and half a tsp of celery seed. Don't be afraid of the Cajun Spice.. you could add more if you want spiceier...but it was just enough for all to enjoy.\n\nI will definitely keep this resicpe and pass it along.
