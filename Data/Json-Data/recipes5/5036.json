No raw egg means you can make this dressing and keep it in the fridge for up to 5 days, and it only gets better with time! For extra presentation serve with croutons, cubes of avocado flesh, and grated Parmesan cheese. Leftover dressing makes good dip for fresh veggies as a snack (Just maybe not at work due to the awesome amount of garlic!)",

Here's a response to the poster who gave only 1 star because of the recipe's name, even though he admitted that it was tasty. First of all, the recipe is NOT named \"Classic Caesar Salad Dressing\" - it's named \"Ingrid's Caesar Salad Dressing\". Because it bears Ingrid's name, she has the right to adjust the ingredients list to her liking. Emeril does it, Bobby Flay does it, etc. What would be the point of this website if everyone used exactly the same ingredients for every recipe?  BORING!! Kudos to MommyKirsten for having the heart of an artist and the palate of a chef and for sharing her recipe. If you agree, give it a thumbs-up.",

I did up the fresh parmesan to 1/4 cup and I also used reduced fat mayonnaise. I made no other changes. This dressing was just enough to cover my Macaroni Caesar Salad without drowning it in dressing and the flavor was wonderful. Very, very good. I'll use this dressing again, only I will take the submitter's suggestions and make it ahead of time for the best flavor.",

Update:  Hubby didn't care for the blue cheese in this (though I loved it!) so now I leave that out.  Also, I only use about 2 T olive oil as and omit the vinegar, but use a little more lemon juice.  Just personal preference.  Overall, this is a great recipe when looking for Caesar without anchovies.  Worcestershire has anchovies in it so that gives it that \"Caesar\" dressing flavor without the fishy taste.  Thanks!",

For a no-fail, everyone loves it version, stick to the original recipe and it will never let you or your guests down.\nAfter using this recipe several times, I've begun experimenting with it.  I've substituted the blue cheese salad dressing with ranch and creamy italian with stellar results, so don't be afraid to use what you have on hand.  With a bit of experimentation, I've also discovered that you can cut down on the amount of olive oil, or omit it all together if you're trying to save fat/calories.\nThank you Kirsten and Ingrid!
