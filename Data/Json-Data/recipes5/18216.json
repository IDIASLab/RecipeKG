However next time I make it I will lessen the amount of butter to a teaspoon or none at all. The recipe really doesn't need it. Also I would bake it for 18-20 minutes instead of the listed 25. Salmon still cooks when you take it out of the oven so it came out a little too dry for my taste. Overall I loved this recipe and you can put in your own personal touch.",

Before pouring on the marinade I set a bit aside to serve on the side as a dip or spread. That way each person can eat the salmon as sweet as they want. (Just a note about the marinade--since it is butter based it will solidify upon refrigeration.) An excellent recipe that I'm so happy to add to my recipe box.",

I also cut back on the butter. Baked the salmon for only 20 minutes and then broiled for 2-3 min. to get that golden crust.",
