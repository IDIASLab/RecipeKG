Also used tropical fruit marshmallows (which I doubt really affect the flavor but are cute nonetheless). I really don't think just a can of pineapple would have been enough fruit for all that wonderful pink fluff. It still would be good but not really a fruit salad! I'll make my version of this a lot because it was so yummy and so very cheerful looking!",
