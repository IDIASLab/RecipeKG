I read others saying that they \"exploded\". A friend of mine said it would be normal for them to collapse like they did for me but suggested if I wanted to them to sit up pretty (like in the pictures) to maybe take them out after 45 minutes. Regardless these were absolutely yummolicious and will definitely be made again!",

I heated one up in the microwave and it was wierd... The skin refused to come off or be cut and I ended up stabbing the thing with a grapefruit spoon and biting it like that. The taste was great but it was really messy and dumb looking the way we had to eat it. It's probably my fault but I don't know what the dea was...",

I used Cortland apples instead of green (none at the store) and re-hydrated dried cranberries (fresh were not at the store either.) I re-hydrated them by boiling the dried cranberries in lemon juice and just a touch of orange juice and spiced rum before stuffing them in the cored apples. I didn't peel the top third of the apples (because the picture didn't show that but I realize now the photo was submitted by someone else.) I just wasn't happy with the end flavor (besides the blowing up part) just too sweet but perhaps it just lacked the tartness of the fresh cranberries. I don't plan to try this one again but it could be due to my unfortunately necessary alterations (I was making this for a specific holiday dish or else I would have just made something else.)",
