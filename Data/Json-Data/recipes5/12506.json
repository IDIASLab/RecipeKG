Bingo!\n\nThis is a fairly straight-forward recipe, and quick, if you have all the ingredients at hand.  A good mid-week supper.  The recipe says it feeds 4.  My husband and I ate the whole thing as one meal and it was enough.  I think if you were to divide this in 4, you'd need to accompany it with other things (salad, etc...).\n\nI did make a few changes simply because I didn't have all the ingredients it called for -- but it tasted really good.  The changes were minor (didn't have shallot so substituted a small bit of onion).  I think the spices can be increased next time I make it (and yes, there will be next time).  We couldn't taste the paprika at all.  I added what  I thought was plenty of salt and pepper but again, it could use more.  Also more chili flakes if you're into spicy.  I didn't want to overwhelm the shrimp.\n\nFor next time, I'll also broil the shrimp/crumb mixture just before serving to crisp up the crumbs a bit.  With al-dente cauliflower and shrimp, having something with a bit of crunch would be nice.\n\nI don't think it needs the extra wedge of lemon -- or only use a small wedge.  \n\nBut this is a nice recipe for those who like uncomplicated recipes on a mid-week night when you're tired but want something healthy and comforting to eat!",
