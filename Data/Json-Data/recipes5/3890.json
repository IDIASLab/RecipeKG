I put them aside on paper towels and drained most all the oil and added the garlic and cilantro for like 5 min until the garlic crisped and added yhe potatos and the rest of the ingredients and it was sooo good! I served them with some naan (indian flat bread) and yoghurt with salt pepper and cucumber and it was fabulous!",
