No, not bad; just didn't say \"Mmmm!\" with the first bite.  'More an \"Ohhh\" :D  I used 3c mashed sweet potatoes, 1T chiles in paste (pureed), 2T each butter & brown sugar.  No heavy cream.  I may try it with corn.  I like sweet & spicy together, but with sweets just didn't grab me.12/12 Tried the corn switch. Pretty good.  Used 2T ea chipolte peppers, sugar, butter, cream with 3cans corn. Still a little too hot to have more than a few bites. 1T w 2cans might work better. 'Glad I tried it. Note4Me: 1# frozen corn, 1T butter, 1T heavy cream, 1T chipotle puree, 1t sugar.  Try 1 1/2t chipotle puree.",
