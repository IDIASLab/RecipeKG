I wasn't sure which 'cauliflower medley' was intended but I ended up buying Green Giant Riced Cauliflower Medley which has carrots peas and onions. Perfect! I ended up cooking the cauliflower in 2 batches otherwise my large pan was too crowded and the veggies were just steaming as opposed to frying. I did this over high heat. I topped it with fresh green onion. A healthy low-carb alternative to fried rice that I'll be making again!",
