I wasn't sure about the lemon but all the flavors combined to make a very tasty sauce. The roasted broccoli was awesome - I will make it this way just as a side from now on. The only thing I might change would be to add chicken or shrimp for more protein and to use a little less pasta. I like more topping vs. pasta ratio. Even my pickiest eater cleaner her plate. I highly recommend this recipe - it is a keeper!",
