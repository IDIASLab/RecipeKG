Just made it and followed the directions which rarely do only guidlines. Did add 1/2 small onion and 1/2 bunch of cilantro. Tried it and was great wife tried it and thought it was the bomb and couldn't stop eating it even got a slice of bagget out and tried it on that. She said it could use a little sugar added 1 pinch was good added 1 more pinch and it is a keeper. This will be the only salsa i make from now on. Thanks for this one.",
