What a great alternative to mayo laden sides at a BBQ so everyone went to town on the big beautiful platter covered with colorful vegetables. I changed up the vegetables a little bit and I doubled everything. I left out the corn but added whole fresh carrots with a bit of the green top left on them and a couple sliced sweet potatoes. I left everything whole and arranged around a big platter alternating colors then drizzled with the dressing so didn't need all of it (I used just basil but quite a bit of it). I also drizzled with a bit of balsamic glaze. This requires some planning but it is easy. I loved not having to worry about it getting \"cold\" while grilling the steaks and salmon it's great even at room temp. Thanks Celeste! It's already been requested at our next gathering!!",
