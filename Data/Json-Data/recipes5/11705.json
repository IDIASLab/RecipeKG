I refrigerated the stock when it was done then skimmed off the fat the next day.  After letting the stock reach room temperature, I added chicken bullion (1 cube or 1 tsp), I doubled all the seasoning (including the garlic) listed in the recipe plus added 1 tsp of parsley to ensure a flavor boost.  Before I put in the meat and rice, I added 4 tsp of salt (this took the soup to a good base that people could add a bit more if they wanted) and 2 tsp of pepper.  I agree with one of the other reviews that more meat is needed so I added 2 more cups of turkey; adding one more cup of rice gave it the consistency I was looking for.  Hope this helps anyone out there who wants to try this easy recipe and is looking for more flavor.  Enjoy!",
