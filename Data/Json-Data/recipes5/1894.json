(spot is what they are called locally here in southeastern North Carolina silver with a black spot and yellow markings; I don't know if they have other names elsewhere). I was afraid the difference in thickness would make the marinade too strong but since I had about a pound of fillets I decided to chance it. They were perfect grilled in about 3 minutes on my indoor grill. YUMMY! Will be using this recipe again and again. My picky children wouldn't touch it though.",
