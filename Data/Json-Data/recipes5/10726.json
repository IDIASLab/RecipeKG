My corn was frozen sweet corn so I didn't add any water to the salsa. It turned out just fine. And finally, I didn't go outside into the rain to grill the fish; I stayed warm and dry inside, using my Jenn-Air electric grill. The grill marks were not as dark, but hey, what the heck? It still looked good and tasted awesome. My husband was very pleased with what I did to HIS fish!",

I also reduced the amount of lemon - had a small one, still only used about 1 T and it had enough lemon flavor. We didn't have chanterelles so I bought and used Shiitake and it was fine. Also I think there was too much oil for the amount of mushrooms - poured some off after cooking them. I would substitute white wine or sherry for the water next time.
