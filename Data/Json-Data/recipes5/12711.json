The only change I made was to use 12 cups of chicken broth completely omitting the bouillon cubes.  I didn\u2019t have any marjoram on hand so I sprinkled poultry seasoning in it\u2019s place.  I added more carrots but left the onion and celery as stated.  My husband ate almost three bowls!  Delicious!  This will now be added to my recipe book and the other version will be taken out.",
