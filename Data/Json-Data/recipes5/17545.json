I also used 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/4 tsp. of lemon extract.  The cheesecake mixture is excellent - I used 3/4 of an 8 oz. package and 1/2 c. of confectioners' sugar.  I always line my bakeware with Pam for baking to help with taking/popping things out when done.  Don't overfill or you'll have a mess on your hands!  Overall, very good and I can't wait to try these with other types of jams....",
