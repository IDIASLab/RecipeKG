Also I omitted the cheese as I am lactose intolerant and didn't have any pine nuts on hand but this recipe was still AWESOME! The raisins and brown sugar help balance the acidity of the tomatoes vinegar and olives. I didn't microwave the eggplant as the pieces I made were so small little to no water was reserved in them. It didn't taste oily to me. Served it with pot roast and crostinis. Everyone scraped their plates!",

I would rate the recipe as I made it only three stars but I believe that had I followed the recipe more closely it would have been 4 stars hence the 4 star rating. I used tomato sauce instead of V8 white vinegar used a sweeter red wine garlic stuffed green olives all zucchini instead of yellow squash omitted celery and forgot the parm. It was good and we all liked it however it was a bit too sweet. And as Oliversmom noted it got sweeter as it sat longer. Next time if I use a sweet wine again (we tend to drink sweeter wines in my household) I'll reduce the sugar and/or raisins. I'll also make sure to use the red wine vinegar I think that is probably a fairly key ingredient. Also hubby is not a pine nut fan and he believes that it would have tasted better without the pine nuts.",
