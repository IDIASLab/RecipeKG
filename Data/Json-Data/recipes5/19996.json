Before adding these, the recipe was a little too \"bright\" and needed some smokiness.\r\n\r\nI used this recipe over a layered taco salad that included tri-colored tortilla strips, black beans, corn, Chopped tomatoes, quartered & seeded cucumber slices, Mexican cheese, lime wedges (garnish), avocado slices.  I made the Key West chicken recipe from Allrecipes, as another person suggested.  I LOVE these two recipes together!\r\n\r\nI think this Key West chicken and a little of the lime-cilantro dressing drizzled over it could be pretty versatile together, even in different dishes.\r\n\r\n(I cooked the chicken on a grill pan and then cut it into strips to serve with the salad.  With the taco salad, I also served taco-seasoned ground beef and had a bottle of Catalina dressing on hand, so people could go \u201cold school\u201d with their taco salad, if they wanted to do so, instead of using the chicken and lime-cilantro vinagrette.  (The Catalina bottle never got opened, though :)\r\n\r\nI also made taco bowls by putting 10-inch flour tortillas over soup cans in the oven, on a baking sheet, baking @ 400 for 10 min, then letting cool completely so they retain their shape.",
