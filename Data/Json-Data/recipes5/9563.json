Here are my tips: let the molasses/water boil for 10 minutes or so to reduce before mixing it in. Spread onto a baking sheet and let cool. Cut into diamonds or other easy shapes when you're done. I thought this recipe was great. I didn't know what it was when I started making it but it is a nice sweet. I like that it doesn't use refined sugar only molases. And the texture is really interesting!",
