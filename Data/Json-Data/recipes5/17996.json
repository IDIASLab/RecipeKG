What an easy way to spruce up box mixes if you're in a hurry. I used granny smith apples and walnuts as that was what I had on hand. Thanks.",

For some reason the apples I bought a few days ago smell like onions and I didn't want to ruin this so I cut it down to one. I only had to simmer this about 4 minutes and it was done. Also I didn't toast my walnuts just pulled them out of the freezer and dumped a handfull in the skillet. I also added about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream to thin it out a bit since it was pretty thick. This is very similar to a crepe filling I've used from this site. Would also go great over vanilla ice cream or cinnamon rolls. Thanks Ian.",
