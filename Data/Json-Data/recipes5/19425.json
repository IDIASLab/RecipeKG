I used less milk as the full amount would have made the final result runny. I think a little more butter some salt and extra spices would help this.

I only used 1/8 c. sugar and 1 tbsp. butter in an attempt to keep the calories down. It really didn't need any more. My only complaint is that it was too watery despite the fact that I drained the pears and let the sweet potato dry out a little in the pot. I only added about 1/3 c. of the evaporated milk. My pears were quite ripe...maybe that's why? Ended up putting it in the oven for a while to try to dry it out a bit.",

I couldn't find pears at the store (I guess they're out of season?) so I used gala apples I had at home. I also added salt to the pot of boiling water. I have no idea how much but I was pretty liberal with it. Also I measured a cup of milk (not evaporated) and added slowly until I got the consistency I wanted (it turned out to be about a half a cup). I didn't realize I was out of nutmeg so I just doubled the cinnamon. My 4-year old is a cinnamon lover so she loved the flavor! The result was absolutely scrumptious!",

My objection is there is no need for any sugar and certainly not 1/4 cup. I used none and would have preferred a little less sweetness even then. Perhaps I was looking for a vegetable side dish and this is more of a dessert. I didn't think vanilla sounded good either - so left that out and substituted a bit of cardamon for the cinnamon and nutmeg. Also like other reviewers I recognized a whole cup of evaporated milk would make this very runny so just poured in a little perhaps 1/4 cup.",
