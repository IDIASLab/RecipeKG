I found Cavender's Greek Seasoning WAY too salty-240mg sodium for only 1/4 teaspoon and the salty flavor predominated each bite.  Next time I will make my own concoction of herbs for a Greek flair and separately season with Kosher Salt & pepper.  We enjoyed the pistachio crust a lot and I will repeat this recipe.  Even with some Panko crumbs, it's a relatively low-carb option.  I served with spinach that had been saut\u00e9ed with butter/olive oil/garlic and some chicken broth added towards the end.",
