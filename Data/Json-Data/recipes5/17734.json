                "reviewBody": "WOW!! These are so good we have a hard time stopping at 1 or 2! I pour boiling water over the prunes, apricots and dried cranberries (which we like better than raisins) so they can get soft and plump up then use the water off the dried fruit for my 2T. I puree the prunes in the blender with the liquid ingredients. When the prunes and liquid are blended well, I add the apricots and pulse a few times to chop, then the nuts and cranberries. That way there is no chopping and all the liquid ingredients are in one place and ready to pour into the dry. The dough is stiff, but needs no extra liquid..especially with the softened fruit which adds a little more moisture. We stir as much as possible then finish with our hands! Most ovens are different but we usually end up baking these for 8 1/2 to 9 minutes as they do get dry if baked too long and are so much better a little underbaked. May help to do a few test cookies to get the time right.",

I used 3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour instead of white, and (because these are for my kids) I processed the rolled oats to a fine consistency in the food processor. I also added 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa to the dry ingredients. I substituted 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the prune puree, and omitted the dried fruit and nuts. I added a bag of high quality dark chocolate chips.  I scooped out the dough onto a baking sheet and put it in the freezer for a few minutes for ease of handling.  Then I patted down the dough and wrapped the cookies to freeze. This way, I can just pull these out of the freezer and bake them fresh before school every morning.  My kids LOVE these!",
