I didn't have a few of the ingredients so I made some substitutions: I used coarsely ground oats for the wheat germ, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice plus milk to equal 1 cup for the buttermilk, and 1 cup regular chocolate chips for the 1/2 cup minis.  Then I added some raw sugar on top for some crunchiness.  Right out of the oven they stuck to the paper, so next time I will probably just grease the pan well and skip the paper liners.  I got 18 regular-size muffins out of this recipe.  And if you're wondering about the cinnamon, use it!  It's not a real dominant flavor, instead it just enhances the chocolate flavor.  Thanks for this recipe, I will likely use it again!",

At first I wasn't sure why, but a few baking experiments (I bake a lot) helped me figure it out.  Flax seeds, ground, are an egg replacement.  They work wonderfully, but not understanding their properties and using too much is going to result in this heavier texture.  I recommend omitting the egg, and reducing the flax seeds to about 1 tbsp. (with 3 tbsp. water).  Make up about 3/4 cup with either whole wheat (finely ground) or whole spelt flour.  This should produce a lighter, fluffier muffin that is still healthy.  I am going to try to work with this recipe some more to see what I can come up with.  It's a good start, just misunderstands some ingredients.",

I decided to try this one because I don't eat anything \"unhealthy\" so I don't use AP flour etc. I halved this recipe used half brown & half evaporated cane sugar. Subbed buttermilk for 1/2 cup soymilk & 2 tsp. Apple cider vinegar. I also recommend people to get chocolate chips that have a 60%-70% cocoa content if you want that ooey gooey yummy chocoholic yummyness we all want sometimes. Just roughly chop them up and throw them in with the dry ingredients. I also used 1/3 of the cinnamon that was posted and I think it made a difference in the batter. I also used greek yogurt instead of pumpkin puree since I didn't have it on hand. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!:D",

He made the recipe as is and was quite meticulous at making sure we measured the right amount and used the right ingredients. We didn't have mini-chips so we used regular chocolate chips. I wisked the dry ingredients together until smooth then tossed the chips in the dry. We added the combined wet ingredients and used the spatula to fold in the wet until everything was just moistened. That made a really fluffy muffin. My son thought the sugar crystals on the top were a great idea so we sprinkled a little Sugar in the Raw on top of the muffins before baking. Really REALLY good. Especially with a cup of hot coffee. All but three are gone. We really enjoyed these. I do think that when we make these again I would cut back on the cinnamon just a bit.",
