I almost doubled the spices, used fresh spinach, subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta and increased the amount slightly, increased the amount of Parmesan slightly, added some chopped provolone cheese, and added some Italian style bread crumbs to combat the soupiness.  Also, half way through baking, I topped the halves with fresh tomato slices instead of sauce.  NOW it was excellent, after a little tweaking.  A very good basic recipe, though.",

I used cottage cheese rather than ricotta and I used a strainer to reduce liquid since many said it was soupy. I also added breadcrumbs to the cheese mixture. Microwaving rather than steaming the zukes saved time and two pots. Had to cook 20 min before adding sauce then another 10-15 (I also topped with cheese and breadcrumbs). Endlessly adaptable and pretty presentation - I recommend you try this recipe and play with it to suit your tastes. I'll be using this all summer! Thanks for the recipe.",
