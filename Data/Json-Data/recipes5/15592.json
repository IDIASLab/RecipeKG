I tweaked the base recipe a little to reduce the fat and salt. I used Hellman's canola mayo instead of regular mayo and low fat sour cream. I also only used 1 avocado - it was plenty for our tastes. Instead of high sodium taco seasoning I combined 1 full tsp of cumin 1 full tsp black pepper 1/4 tsp cayenne 1/4 tsp chili powder 1/4 tsp onion powder 1/4 tsp smoked paprika & 1/8 tsp ground mustard. Omitted the hot pepper sauce entirely. The spices added enough kick. Super yummy & perfect over salad greens!! I will be making this all summer long! Thanks Kiki!",
