Scallops should be cooked on medium high to high heat (you want them browned after all- \"No color, no flavor\" as Gordon Ramsay says), and this just means the garlic burns badly in the butter while the scallops cook. I trusted the recipe, and had to quickly heat up and add butter to another pan to transfer the scallops to before they got burned garlic taste on them. If done again I would add the garlic after I'd turned removed the scallops and turned down the heat. Then add the lemon juice and seasonings. Otherwise simple and tasty.",
