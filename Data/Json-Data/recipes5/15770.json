The pork was great, but I've since gone on and used ground beef, shredded beef, chopped chicken, shredded chicken, ground turkey. And then, just when I thought I'd exhausted the possibilities, came up with the notion to use chopped nuts and syrup, apple pie filling, cream cheese with strawberries, the list I think can go on and on. So glad I found this recipe, and yes, the pork version is terrific!",

I roasted a 13 pound bone-in pork shoulder roast scored and rubbed down with salt chopped garlic about 2 tablespoons of liquid hickory smoke taco seasoning and one 14.5 oz can of chicken broth and onions in the oven at 325 covered with foil for 4 hours. When cooled enough to shred I weighed out 3 pounds for this recipe and made shredded pork barbecue with the remaining (largest) part for a church supper. I served this recipe with soft flour tortillas (not fried though I'm sure that would be excellent) fresh diced tomato onion and finely shredded sharp cheddar. I will absolutely be making this again. Will roast in oven again because it doesn't require checking on. Thanks Carolyn Craft Kirkman!",
