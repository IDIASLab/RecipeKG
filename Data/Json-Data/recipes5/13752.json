LOL I had a feeling the grenadine was going to sink not float & even though I poured it very carefully onto the back of a spoon I was right. It immediately sank to the bottom. Could be the fault of the bartender though...a fancy flair bartender I am not. Maybe I need more practice? LOL I think it looks just as pretty down there as it would floating on top though.;o) I garnished w/ a marashino cherry & a sprig of chocolate mint. Thansk for a recipe I'll enjoy again & again J.
