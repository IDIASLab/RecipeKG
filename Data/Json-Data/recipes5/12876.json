I did run the adobo peppers through the blender with a little of the sauce then added it to the skillet with the browned ground turkey to make a little sauce. I did not bother using a springform pan I just layered it in a 9x13 glass baking dish. We could still see the layers but it wasn't a hassle trying to un-springform it. We LOVED this dip. LOVED it. The adobo peppers MADE this dip. I can't believe I never thought of this before.",

I would prefer to do the first layer as meat and refried beans - I more solid base. Also - if this is made in advance the avocado really need to be covered with the taco sauce or sour cream. Even with lime avocado will turn brown if exposed to air. The cream cheese layer seemed a little too rich to me - I would suggest using half sour cream. Pico de Gallo would be a wonderful addition.",
