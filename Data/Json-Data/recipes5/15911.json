Most use a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies such as Rotel and I've always thought the diced tomatoes overpower so the tomato sauce was a nice change. I thought the green chilies might overpower in this one but they didn't. The one thing I think needs changed in this recipe is to drain the beef/onion mixture before adding the taco seasoning to eliminate some of the grease. Overall I was pleased and will definitely make this again for football parties.",
