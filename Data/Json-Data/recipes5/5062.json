For those people who don't like fish this recipe doesn't have much of a \"fishy\" taste so you should try it. This is better than the \"Broiled Tilapia Parmesan\" Recipe that is also on allrecipes, I think because of the added seasoning step. I searched for a recipe for Sazon seasoning on google and though it's a little extra work to mix up yourself you can definitely taste the difference (I've tried both with and without the seasoning and it's huge!). I too had difficulty finding Sazon in my grocery stores - so I made my own after searching on google, 1 tsp each of: salt, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, cumin, corriander.",

I didn't have any sazon seasoning but I had something called 'Spike' seasoning which is a similar all-purpose seasoning that we used instead. Other than that we followed the recipe exactly. We might use less butter (used actual butter not margarine) next time as I felt it was richer than it needed to be to impart all the flavor. I also used low-fat mayonnaise instead of fat free. The extra calories from the low-fat instead of fat-free mayo & full fat butter probably also contributed to rich taste. Either way super yummy and will definitely make again!",
