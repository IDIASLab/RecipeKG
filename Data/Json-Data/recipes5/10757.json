Instead of skirt steak I used two 6-inch chicken sausage links (which I grilled the day before and had leftover). I made sandwiches with toasted sourdough bread. They were really good. The ratio of veggies to meat to cheese to bread was perfect IMHO. I saved the leftover veggie/meat saute and the leftover cheese sauce. The second day I just toasted new bread microwaved the leftovers and it tasted just as good as the first day. I'm not giving it 5 stars because it didn't knock my socks off but it was a good solid meal. In fact my husband requested I add it to \"the rotation\".",
