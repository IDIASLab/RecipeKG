I couldn't get enough of it; no matter where you ate, there would be a small bowl of this divine sauce on the table, each unique to the person making it. Only recently have I actively searched out the recipe. I did not follow the recipe to a tee, but combined this recipe with another a close friend gave me. In the end, I can't argue the results!",

I did use my own measurements as written in the notes but stuck to the ratios of the ingredients. I used vegan bouillon with nutritional yeast instead of beef. The aroma alone will entice you. I put it on baked tofu and it stole the show. There isn't one particular taste that stands out. It is simply a mix of flavours that accent the chile peppers. I used scotch bonnets for the principal peppers and added a large piece of a roma tomato. I can see where this would go well with everything. Definitely a staple to have around the table. Thank you Shilo for this recipe.",

Im sure with peppers straight out of my garden it'd be better. \n\nFor me it needed vinegar, a few more dates and a squirt of mustard. I think roasting the peppers and onions before might be a delicious addition as well!\n\nOutside of that I loved everything about it!!! Looking forward to dialing this in over time.

Used Minors Beef Base instead of beef boullion because that's what I had on hand.. It's wonderful on rice and beans or on anything that you just want a yummy condiment. I'll make it again maybe with a slightly hotter pepper or two thrown in. Reminded me a bit of HP steak sauce but without the hint of vinegar.",
