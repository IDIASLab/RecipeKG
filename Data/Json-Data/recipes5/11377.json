But if you are okay with bacon and butter once in a while then this recipe is terrific! I made it exactly as written with one small exception. When I began wrapping the bacon around each chicken thigh it seemed to me that it was just too much butter for each thigh (1-1/2 lb was 5 thighs) so I cut the amount of butter in half (I can use the leftover compound butter for something else; it won't go to waste). The chicken still came out juicy and delicious even though cooking it for the recommended time resulted in an internal temp of 185 degrees. When I saw that I was afraid that the chicken would be dry and tough but it wasn't at all. I will definitely make this again but may reduce the cooking time a bit.",
