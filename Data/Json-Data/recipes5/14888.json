The potato will continue to cook while it sits due to the trapped steam.  This yields a better result, that isn't overdone. -- Add the butter and cheese, then microwave an additional 45 seconds to melt cheese. --For some real flavor, I top mine with butter, sour cream, more cheese AND shredded or pulled hot BBQ chicken, beef, or pork with a little salt & pepper to taste.    --YUMMY!!!
