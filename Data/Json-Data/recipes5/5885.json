Temper the eggs with the wine mixture then hit it with the hot butter.. make sure that blender is on high while adding the hot mixtures so the eggs don't cook. i also use vermouth instead of white wine.",

It certainly thickened up beautifully and was easy enough to make but lacked that richness and depth of flavor that you expect from a b\u00e9arnaise sauce. Also it was a little too lemon-y and I thought it could have used more tarragon. You can buy pasteurized eggs specifically for recipes like this calling for raw egg yolks and I typically buy them half a dozen at at time (they're more expensive). Not a total disappointment for us because I think this would be good on steamed asparagus instead of hollandaise and even on a poached egg. For our tastes the good is that I'll probably occasionally sub this for hollandaise on some food but the bad is it didn't work on grilled beef. Sorry Bridgetclarke for a mediocre review.",

For you cooks who didn't like the method, many yrs. ago I learned to make Hollandaise from a Betty Crocker cookbook (1952 version).  It has never failed, but is time-consuming.  You start by putting the egg yolks & lemon juice in a heavy sauce pan (no double boiler).  Add half the cold butter and cook on very low heat, stirring constantly.  Then, after that butter is melted, add the 2nd half of butter (must be right out of frig) and again stir constantly until melted.  The idea is you are cooking the eggs slowly so they don't curdle.  I have NEVER had this sauce breakdown using this method.  Hope this helps some of you wonderful cooks:)",
