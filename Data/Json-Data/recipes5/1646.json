It's my revamp of a recipe that was in our newspaper a couple of years ago and we love it. Make it your own by varying the ingredients to fit your taste. I did and my family loves it! The next time I make these tasty taters, I'm going to toss a few cooked peas on top of the meat mixture (under the potatoes) and make it a true shepherd's pie supper!",

While it tasted great, it wasn't the consistency of mashed potatoes like would be on a shepherd's pie. I left them \"lumpy\" but will add a little bit of milk next time. This recipe is a keeper!",
