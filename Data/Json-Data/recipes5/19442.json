Just a few minor changes I made were using vanilla yogurt therefore needed less brown sugar and I found some chocolate mint at a Farmer's market which tastes great in this drink. Have been looking for various ways to use up the ground star anise and this is perfect. More stars from us on this one! Curious to taste with a spicy Indian meal too. I am going to do a comparison with another Mango Lassi recipe on this site also. Thanks for the post.",
