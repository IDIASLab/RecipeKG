Even my sister liked it and she made it exactly the way the recipe called for so I know she didn't even miss the butter or extra sugar. I made the batter the night before so the seasonings had time to meld togther. I froze the leftovers and reheated in the toaster and it was even better. Plus the extra crispiness from the toasted helped the pancakes from being to soggy. The mixture of seasonings is wonderful. Thanks for posting this recipe.",
