When preparing the pie, I tasted the filling prior to putting it into the pie crust and was weary that it may not have enough lemon flavor.  However after it chilled overnight, it had just the right amount of tartness.  My mother-in-law begged for the recipe and I'm almost ashamed to give it to her as it was embarassingly easy, but FABULOUS!  Thanks for sharing, I will definitely be making this one regularly.",

I like to make my own graham cracker crust (buy the ready to use Keebler Graham cracker crumbs) since it tastes so much better - sweeter crunchier and homemade tasting. I think the ready made crusts always taste stale and they crumble and fall apart when you cut into them. Like others I added about 5-6 drops of yellow food coloring added 1.5 teaspoon lemon extract and increased lemon juice to 2/3 cups (use quality bottled lemon juice). Sweet and tangy similar to a lemon chiffon pie and will take you a whole 15 min. from start to finish. TIP- Freeze this especially if you add more lemon juice. Trust me it won't be 'frozen' but will taste like a silky key lime pie coming out of the freezer. The fridge isn't cold enough to firm this up. I also make this in a 9 in. springform pan which makes serving and cutting very easy.",

I thought it wasn't quite lemon enough the 1st time so the 2nd time I made it I used 2/3 cup lemon juice and it came out a little softer but zingier which I like. I also put a few drops of yellow food coloring to make it the perfect lemon-yellow color. It's my new standby though it's so easy and delicious!",
