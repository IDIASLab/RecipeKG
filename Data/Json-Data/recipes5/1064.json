The convention of cooking it low and slow often results in dried-out meat that never reaches the proper internal temperature. Instead of waiting all day and risking such disappointment, we dial up the temperature slightly and bake it in about half the time to ensure it's both tender and moist.

I did add garlic powder to the seasoning and used sea salt instead of kosher.  For the onion apple mix I added a splash of apple cider vinegar and 1/2 a finely diced apple.  Cooked the brisket exactly as directed. Put the drippings in the blender and returned to stove and thickened with cornstarch and water.  Soooooo. Goood!!!
