I don't know where it went wrong or if I did anything incorrectly (I for one believe I followed the book to a tee) but this thing turned out TOO Fluffy! I Didn't think that would be an issue you could even have but the finished product resembles pumpkin seafoam more than a chiffon. The whipped cream upon dolloping SUNK into the depths of my 9x13 pan. I hope to god none of you have this same issue but for what I know this issue resigns in the recipe.",
