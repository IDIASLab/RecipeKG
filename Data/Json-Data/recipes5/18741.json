I get on allrecipes.com and look up apple cobbler and find this gem. I don't have apples but I do substitute a 21 oz. can of store brand apple pie filling for them. I made the rest of recipe as listed and baked in the microwave for 12 minutes. This was 5 minutes to prepare, 12 minutes to bake; it was delicious. This one is a new favorite of mine!!!! 10 stars for tasty, quick and easy (with the pie filling). Thank you!!!!! I will be submitting my picture of this dish.",

I used 6 small granny smith apples, instead of 4 large ones, and doubled the quantity of the topping.  Also added some nutmeg along with the cinnamon and allspice.  An apple corer saved a lot of time getting the peeled apples sliced (not too thin, or the filling turns to mush).  It all fit in an 8x8 clear glass baking dish.  I microwaved it for the full 12 minutes, and everything was cooked through and cooked evenly.  The topping was nice and chewy, not too dry in my opinion.\n\nMight decrease the time just a bit for firmer apples next time, as well as use a little less butter and sugar.  I agree with a previous reviewer -- the topping did not really crumble, and had to be put in pats on top. \n\nWith ice cream and extra ingredients, there was enough for 10-12 people.  A keeper!",
