I just stirred in the cranberries and chocolate chips once the granola came out of the oven. I made sure to use a spatula to rotate the granola every five minutes so it cooked evenly. My kids had this in a yogurt/fruit breakfast sundae I had this just in a bowl with FF milk. Good stuff. I'd make this again in a heartbeat.",

But for some reason I would have preferred it without chocolate. And I put chocolate on EVERYTHING! Next time I am going to sub raisins for the chocolate chips. I think it will make a nice cinnamon raisin granola. The mild nuttiness from the peanut butter is not too overpowering so it is versitile.",
