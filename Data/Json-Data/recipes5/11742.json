The dark green on one side with bright red tomatoes white fish in the middle and roasted new red tomatoes on the other side made a lovely presentation. Next time I make this it will be for company as I expect them to be impressed.",

I ended up pureeing a few marinated artichoke hearts together with 5 or 6 kalamata olives, and that worked perfectly as far as providing a briny/salty element to top the cod. \n\nI found the recipe timing to be right on. My cod fillets were on the thinner side, so they were perfect right around the 12-minute mark. I had let the vegetables go the full 15 minutes because I had regular green beans as opposed to the thinner french-style. I used the opportunity to throw the grape tomatoes on top of the beans for the last three minutes, and they cooked just shy of bursting, which I loved!",
