So the second time I made it I increased the sauce ingredients by 1/2 and it was plenty.  I used a prepackaged frozen seafood medley in place of all shrimp and it was wonderful.  I also think the pepper amount was fine.  It is peppery but after all, the recipe is for \"Shrimp Lemon PEPPER Linguini\".  I can see though how some taste buds might think it is too much pepper.  Overall, this recipe is a winner.  It is definately restaurant quality and definately good enough to serve to company.",

This is truly a recipe best reserved for linguini or any other wide pasta and nothing else.  I will try and use less lemon zest next time since I prefer a more 'shrimpy' taste than a 'lemony' one.  This, of course, is just a personal taste though.  This was an especially tasty recipe and one everyone should try!",

Top it with some fresh grated parmesan cheese and some fresh tomatoes on the side and you have the perfect meal. Thanks for a wonderful recipe skini!",
