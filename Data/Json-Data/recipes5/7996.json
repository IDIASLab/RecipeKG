As such, I improvised and changed a few things around from a zucchini bread recipe and created this healthy, hearty, summertime bread. It has a slightly different flavor than zucchini bread but the same moist consistency and sweet, summery taste and smell. Note: it is not very sweet and does taste 'healthy', so it's probably not a big hit for kids unless chocolate chips are added.",

Added a few more blueberries and used white whole wheat flour as well as the all purpose flour, otherwise, followed the directions.  I always bake recipes like this in three mini loaf pans primarily for portion control, and they baked for 35 minutes at 350\u00baF.  I agree with the recipe submitter, this is probably not something your kids are going to go wild about, but it is extremely moist, tender, and the blueberries just pop in your mouth (there's your sweetness).  One loaf was eaten today, and the other two went into the freezer. Hannah Rose, thanks for sharing your recipe.",
