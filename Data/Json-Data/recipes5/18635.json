Oh yeah and I added onion powder. I used all ingredients (minus the ribs) as a \"sauce\" to marinate the ribs overnight (reserving half of it to use while cooking) then covered tightly with foil. I slow cooked them at 250 degrees for several hours while we were out at a family function. (we were gone from 3pm to 6:30pm) They absolutely FELL off the bone and were sooooo tender! I had researched other recipes but this turned out to be the BEST launching pad recipe. This is going to be added to the hand-me-down family recipe box for all time. I might try to add cayenne pepper next time though. That might just put this \"insane\" recipe right over the top and commit us all to the asylum! Everyone at the table kept saying between bites \"mmm-this is really really good.\" Honestly there wasn't any intelligent conversation at the dinner table tonight; only exclamations of delight. And once dinner was over immediate texting to friends about the great meal. My stay-at-home-mom kitchen-cooking-ego is fit to burst!",

I did do a couple of things different. I put all the sauce in with the ribs in a glass dish and covered it with foil for the first 15 minutes. Once the sauce had thickened up I removed the foil turned the ribs brushed the sauce all over them and cooked for another 15 minutes without covering. They came out perfect! I will make this again!",
