If you absolutely don't have time or can't get all the ingredients Gourmet Garden has a fabulous Moroccan spice blend. I started with that and added the other ingredients. Also make sure you use good quality fresh seabass a recipe is only going to be as good as the product! ps. I'm not a coconut fan so I did leave that out. The citrus flavors in this are to die for. Make sure you use fresh lemon lime and orange juice worth the effort! Thank you for a great recipe!",
