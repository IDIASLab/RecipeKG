After reading the reviews I halved the milk and cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup. As well I added 2 tbsp of fresh chopped chives and in place of the garlic salt added a clove of fresh garlic (cut in quarters) to the potatoes with five minutes left to cook and mashed the garlic in with the other ingredients. Great accompaniment to lamb.",
