Julie K, I saved the broth the wings were parboiled in and added some chopped leftover chicken (2 breasts, 4 thighs), 1c. chopped celery and 1c. chopped carrots to it. It was a little salty, so I added about 2 1/2 cups water (to taste), boiled it until the veggies were tender (30 min?) and ladled it over rice. Makes an awesome soup!",

Baked them on convection oven setting for 20 minutes at 425. They turned out golden spicy and delicious. Great recipe!",
