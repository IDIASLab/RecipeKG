Also roll and cut quickly as this dough becomes very soft very fast. By the time I rolled out the dough and cut the cookies it was difficult to even get them onto the cookie sheet without sticking to the board and falling apart. And the dough was so soft by the time the cookie sheet went into the oven that they spread out when baked. Admittedly I m not a dedicated baker but I have to wonder if there should be more flour or less butter??? Because of what s just been mentioned I only baked six cookies at a time and the dough and board was well floured...took too long and I don t like that either. The texture of the cookie was fine but other than the plum fruit they had very little flavor. Do yourself a favor and at a minimum add some vanilla or almond extract to the cookie dough. They were OK and will be eaten but I won t be making this recipe again just too many issues.",
