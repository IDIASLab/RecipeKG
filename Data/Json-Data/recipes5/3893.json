(The dry beans probably would have been better if I had them.) We never had borscht before. It was pretty good but I expect it is an acquired taste. We'll have plenty of opportunity to find out as it made enough to last us for a couple of weeks. There are just 2 of us. Anyway thanks for the recipe. It was fun trying something different. Mar. 14 update: I put some of this in freezer containers and saved. My husband and I happily did acquire a taste for it and now we love it. Just had some for lunch today and my hubby asked is that all? There wasn't enough left for seconds.:) Have to increase the rating to 5 stars. Congratulations for a distinctly unique and very delicious recipe! Now I have another good use for all my rye berries.",

After about 1.5 hours they were scalded and stuck to the bottom of the pot. I tried again with three cups of water and had success. Problem number two (this is minor but still inconvenient) was that the beets were still quite crunchy after 30 minutes of simmering. It took more like 50-55 minutes to get things to the right consistency. As for the taste... well it tastes like a bunch of vegetables cooked in water. That shouldn't have come as a surprise I suppose. And that's not a bad thing. There just isn't anything particularly special about this recipe. I had hoped it would be more flavorful. I'll stick with the Ukrainian Red Borscht Soup in the future which is exceptional.",
