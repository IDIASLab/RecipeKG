As one kid said, 'this goes in the rotation'... which is pretty good praise from my crowd.\nNot sure if the sauce got away from me, but it turned out a tad grainy. Not inedible at all, but there at the last, I got a little busy and think it separated a tad. I resized the recipe to serve 6, and it told me to use 3 cups of half and half, which would have been ridiculous, so I only used 2 and reduced it by about 1/3. \nServed over buttered noodles with some boneless loin chops I carved from a whole loin and a side of sauteed cabbage with leeks.\nAll around great experience. I would pay for this in a restaurant, and that's about as good as it gets in my world.",
