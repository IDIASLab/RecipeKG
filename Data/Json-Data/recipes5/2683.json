Used the submitter's substitution below the recipe for Memmi soup base  I love ketchup with eggs and with rice, so all three together were good. Id suggest cooking the vegetables all at the same time first . I diced them really small and the carrots took a long time to get tender any meat would work well in this.. will add more to leftovers",
