I usually add about 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce when I'm browning the meat and onions. Also as I'm browning the meat I mix the other ingredients and let simmer really mixes those flavors well before adding the meat. A few other changes I made are only 1 can of beans (I don't like beans) and added a can of condensed Tomato soup about 1/4 cup mild taco sauce and 1 tablespoon hot sauce (just enough to give a slight heat). But with this base you can be very creative and make it slightly different every time. Excellent dinner on a budget as well. Everyone had seconds (Family of 5)and we still had a lot for left-overs.",
