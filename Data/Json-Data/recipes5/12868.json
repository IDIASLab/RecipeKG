My avocado was the size of a small pineapple and so I only used one. Since my avocado was so large it wasn't overly salty. I suggest using less dressing mix or adding another avocado. My sandwiches will never be the same again! I think this would be great with other dry mixes as well. Next time I'm going to try taco seasoning or fajita mix or Italian dressing. The possibilities are endless! I'm glad I found this recipe!!",

I used one avocado Tbsp of fresh lime juice 1 Tbsp ranch seasoning mix and a tiny dollop of lite mayo. This was still so tangy I could barely stand it.

I now have way more than I need for my two grilled chicken sandwiches but I'm pretty sure it will turn easily into guacamole.",
