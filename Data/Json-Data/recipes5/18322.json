I used three extra large...) I bet this would be awesome with chicken shrimp tofu... but a great one to keep on hand for vegetarian guests. I can't wait to have leftovers for breakfast!

                "reviewBody": "Nice recipe. Traditional pad thai is made with several hard to find ingredients, and I never thought ketchup would be a suitable substitute for some of these. Turns out it's a great sub. My tip: skip the boiling water for the noodles. Just put them in a bowl of very hot tap water while you prep the rest of the dish. They'll be perfectly al dente when you are ready to cook them. Boiling risks over-cooking the noodles which makes for a gummy mess of a dish. Also, fish sauce is crucial IMO. It may stink, but it adds a depth of flavor to the overall dish that you can't get with soy.",
