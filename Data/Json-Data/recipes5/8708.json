I will also use ricotta cheese next time in place of the cottage cheese, and 3 cups not 2. My Baba made these when I was growing up, and perogies are alot of work. I am also going to lightly stir fry some shredded cabbage and onions in butter and add that as a layer also. All and all these were just yummy, with that old fashioned flavor.
