I do not know what part of the counrty Angela or anyone who gave this a good review are located but in Maryland putting the words crab and imitation in the same sentence is taboo. Although her recipe has the makings for a good dip I strongly recommend using REAL fresh crab meat ( from the Maryland Chesapeake Bay if you can ) and see the difference. Would anyone eat an imitation Filet Mignon?",

I am serving this dip at a Super Bowl Party and will put mini pumpernickle bread slices and tortilla chips for dipping. I think the shredded cheddar cheese should be cut in half because I taste more cheese than crabmeat and I did add extra hot sauce. Overall a delicious easy dip that I think is fantasticly easy to whip up. I am certain all the people at the party will be enjoying this one.",
