I know some gingerbread-like cookies are often flavorless cardboard. But these were REALLY good. I added 1 tsp vanilla and next time will increase the brown sugar to a whole cup....for a few people who wanted them sweeter. We used little man cutters. We made buttercream frosting and piped on faces and buttons. It was alot of fun and they are GREAT flavorful cookies! I will be using this recipe again at Christmastime for sure!",

I've tried probably 6 or 7 different recipes and he's always hated them... until this one!! I've made 3 batches in 3 days 1st night I quartered the recipe to make 1 dozen (since I figured it'd just be my son & I eating them) 2nd night made half the recipe (they didn't last through the night) 3rd night which is tonight I made the full recipe and they're STILL already almost gone!!! My husband never devours cookies like this so this is definitely a recipe to save! I followed everything exactly the first night and they were great. 2nd & 3rd batches I added just a bit of vanilla which was even better! Sprinkled with sugar fresh out of the oven and they disappear almost instantly! I'll never use another molasses cookie recipe besides this one again! Thanks SO much!!:)",

Oh and I'm lazy and have very little counter space so I don't like rolling out cookies so I rolled the dough into small balls with my hands dipped them in sugar dropped them on the cookie sheet and flattened them a bit with the fork (the sugar helps the fork not stick to the dough).
