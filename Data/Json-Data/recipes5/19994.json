I just omitted it and sprinkled the fries with salt AFTER I'd tossed them with a little EVOO and the spice blend. Very good. I can't wait to try this on homemade turkey burgers and as a rub on chicken or pork too!",

This recipe was OK. I followed the ingredients to the letter. I think it would make a better taco seasoning than a burger rub. Since the instructions are non-existent this is what I did: I combined the ingredients and shook them to mix them in a small tupperware bowl. I had some frozen beef patties I got from the market so I spooned out 6 tbs of the mix into a larger tupperware bowl and moistened the still-frozen patties with water. Then I shook them individually in the bowl to coat them. Using the original wax paper dividers I stacked them again and covered the bowl putting them in the refrigerator to marinate for two hours. They were half-thawed when I fried them on the stovetop and they came out more juicy than usual. Although I didn't care for the flavor that much the prep method worked out really well. If you're torn between tacos and burgers for dinner by all means this is a good recipe but I personally will look elsewhere.",
