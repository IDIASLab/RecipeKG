I took the advice from the recipe submitter's notes and used butter in place of coconut oil, and whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose. I also used pure maple syrup instead of honey. I made a half batch, and got 21 cookies out of the recipe using my medium cookie scoop. They were baked perfectly in 13-14 minutes at 350 (my oven runs a bit hot so I baked at 350 vs 375). Great cookies! Thank you for the recipe!",
