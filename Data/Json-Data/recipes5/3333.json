Will definitely make these again. Thank you for posting the recipe.",

First you need to use short ribs. they are one of the most flavorful cuts of meat period and the point of this dish is to slow cook them so they are very tender and cut with a fork. delicious. 2nd double the wine/lemon/beef broth so that you have a lot of liquid to simmer the meat in. Use a tall narrow pan to cook it if available. in order to make the sauce thicker (which i believe it needs) make a roux to thicken it. i like butter/flour ( 1/8 cup butter 1/4 cup flour). once the dish is completely finished cooking and ready to serve add the roux until the sauce is a little less thick than gravy. Finally i like to serve this dish over sushi rice thou mashed potatoes certainly do make plenty of sense to me:) It would work over egg noodles also. Enjoy. Everyone i know that has had it this way loves it.",
