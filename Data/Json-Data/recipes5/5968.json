The sauce makes a great chip dip or vegetable dip as well. We go through so much of it, I double it! My husband's family is Belgian, Flemish to be exact. I am told Flemish is equated with quality. This is a snack that is worth the time and effort! Since this is all about quality, be sure to use firm, fresh potatoes. Bring the sauce to room temperature before serving.",

Only difference, she used peanut oil because it is lighter tasting & you can crisp better & quicker because you can fry with peanut oil at a higher temperature.  Peanuts originally come from India and peanut oil (a mono-saturate & therefore healthy) is the oil of choice for woks & other frying & saut\u00e9ing in Asia & Belgium & France (don't know about other countries).  My Maman always used Planters as some of the off-brands can small/taste rancid.  While living in the South, I found the LouAna brand to be just as good.  My Maman used peanut oil to make her own mayo, salad dressings & anything else that calls for veggie oil. In Belgium you can buy paper cones of Frites from stands on the street like you can get hot dogs in NYC.  You have your choice of several sauces -- myself, I preferred Piccalillie so here at home, I usually use French's yellow mustard.",

I have been so desperate and almost purchased a jar of andalose off the Begium Shop to just get some of these. This sauce is truly one of a kind and if this recipe taste just like their original sauce I will be making it all the time. I miss their fries as well and the beer Kriek which maybe your husband can tell you how to make that beer. It is also a belgium beer and they use real cherry's in the beer. I think I may need to order that online cause brewing probably is a bit hard. I can't wait to make this sauce tonight. Thank you for the receip.",

I stayed with an old retired pair who showed me their way of making fries - double dipping and flavoring the oil with garlic. This holiday I received a T-Fal deep fryer and decided to give this recipe a go and try it on my kids and invited company. Remembering to flavor vegetable oil with some garlic cloves this recipe hit the spot! The results were delicious especially the sauce. Note: used veg. oil not olive oil; my prep time was about 4 hours and the sauce was fine.",
