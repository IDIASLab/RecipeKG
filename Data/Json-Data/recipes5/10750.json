Having said that, if you cook it a little further, until it almost starts to simmer, it will get a bit thicker, if that's your preference. Just don't go too far, or the yolks may start to form curds, and you'll lose the silkiness. Serve over buttered toast or in freshly baked puff pastry shells.",

Great BASIC recipe, but I used slivered garlic in my clarified butter....saut\u00e9ed chopped onions and sliced mushrooms in it to start, THEN  the sherry.....then the yolks, cream, nutmeg and cayenne!

Per the video I used tarragon instead because that's what I had as well as cognac instead of sherry because I had it on hand, both changes mentioned in the video, only other change was adding a little diced shallot when adding the congac. Awesome !!!!!!!   A few years ago I made a large bowl of this when I lived in CT a few years ago when lobster was cheaper than hot dogs for the 4th of July and poured it over a pile of pasta, it was incredible.",
