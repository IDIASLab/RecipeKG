I baked for 30 minutes as directed, checked it and it was too \"watery\" so since I had to pick up my son from practice I reduced the oven temp to 180 to prevent overcooking and served when we came home nearly an hour later. It was still runny. As for the rest of the recipe, I did use canned, diced, fire-roasted chiles instead of fresh and reduced the garlic powder to 1 teaspoon.",
