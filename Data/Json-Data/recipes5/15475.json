I had some rib seasoning leftover from the week-end (1 tablespoon of cumin 1 tablespoon chili powerder 1 tablespoon of paprika) so I added that. It was perfect - right amount of heat! Since I was using more meat I did use 2 cups of salsa and 8 tablespoons of peach preserves. I served it over spanish rice. There were only the two of us and we had to stop ourselves from eating the entire serving. My guy already claimed the leftovers for lunch. Thanks submitter.",

It wasn't without some changes however some intentional and some not. The intentional change was using can peaches adding a bit of sugar and boiling them down as another reviewer suggested. The unintentional change was that after I seasoned my pork cubes with the taco seasoning I got ahead of myself and added the salsa before I browned the pork. What else could I do but cook it anyway. I kept it over a medium heat add the peaches a few minutes before serving and it was excellent. This recipe will go very well with chicken.
