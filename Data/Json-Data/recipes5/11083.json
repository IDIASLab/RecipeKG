These were good-quality chops that I bought at Whole Foods and seriously it s been a long time since I ve had chops this tough. The instructions say cook for 10-20 minutes and that time span makes it a little difficult to coordinate the rest of the meal. It would have been helpful if the recipe submitter had indicated the thickness of the chops and then narrowed down the cook time say \"about 8-10 minutes.\" My chops were about 3/4 thick and when I checked the temp at 10 minutes they already were at 154\u00baF overcooked for us. I guess I just really don t care for this method of cooking because the meat ends up with no eye appeal no color just sort of anemic. I did cook the marinade and thickened it into a sauce served over the pork (which I husband said was waaaay too sweet for him) and garnished with some chopped parsley which helped with the presentation. I m the first reviewer and I don t want to discourage others from trying but this just didn t work out for us today.",
