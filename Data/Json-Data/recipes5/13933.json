The crust was flavorful because of the butter, and flakey due to the lard; the dough was a little crumbly to work with, but I'll keep trying, and next time try adding just a touch more water to see what happens as I liked the results.

I made this super-easy in my food processor - mixed the flour salt butter and lard with short brief pulses until I got the consistency I wanted (pea-sized as they say) then added chilled water a tablespoon at a time until the mixture just came together so I didn't measure the water exactly. For those who found their crust \"crumbly \" you may not be adding enough water. This was one of the easier recipes to roll out too! I had no problems getting it into the pie plate whatsoever and it crimped beautifully. Next time however I may increase the amount of fat either the butter or the lard by maybe a couple of tablespoons to add a bit more tenderness and richness to the crust. Otherwise I would call this recipe notably reliable for novice and expert alike.",
