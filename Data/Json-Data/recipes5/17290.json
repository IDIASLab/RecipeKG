I make ice cream quite a lot, so what I did (based on recipes I've made in the past) was to combine the creams in a saucepan and heat them until they simmer.  Meanwhile, I combined the eggs and the sugar, mixed well, added a few scoopfuls of the simmering liquid to the egg mixture to temper the eggs, and then poured the warmed egg mixture into the saucepan and cooked the mixture until it coated the back of a wooden spoon.  I took it off the heat and added the vanilla and browned pecans.  I cooled this ice cream base in the refrigerator a few hours and then mixed it in my ice cream maker.  It was delicious!",

The brown sugar flavor is good, but I'd use a cooked egg custard base from a reliable vanilla recipe. Just substitute brown sugar for white and add the toasted pecans.
