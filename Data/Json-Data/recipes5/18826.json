There are virtually no seasonings listed in the recipe which is rather unusual. I didn't see the need for both bread crumbs and saltines, so I skipped the crackers. A whole onion, garlic and onion powders, black pepper, dried parsley and worcestershire sauce went into the meat mixture. The end result was very tasty but I truly suggest you tweak and add seasonings to your liking because the glaze alone is worth trying. Thank you!",

I like the other reviewer added a lil pineapple to my meat mixture and thought maybe that had an effect on the texture. I dont know what else could have happened. It was almost unedible to be honest. Have no idea what went wrong. I will attempt this again just because im a lil baffled. On a positive note the sauce was AMAZING! A lil to sweet so i will cut back on sugar next time but other than that it was amazing. I used real bacon instead of the bits. If anything i will continue to use the sauce for my meatload topping.",
