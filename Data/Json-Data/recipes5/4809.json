So the second time i made it i reduced the cayanne pepper to 1/8tsp and it was perfect. I also tried the lamb 12hrs in the marinade and then 24 and definately the 24hrs was best.",

It was lovely.\nThe yogurt, like buttermilk, tenderized the meat, seasoning imparted great flavor. It was not overpowering like some spice blends. Made it into gyro-like sandwiches, but would be great in couscous, chopped salads, or as Kebabs!\n\nOther reviewers have noted to cut back on cayenne if you aren't  into \"hot.\" I'd agree. Only used 1/2 tsp of cayenne and it was just the perfect amount of spicy without inducing tears and sweat.\nThanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "The flavor is to die for! However I do have some suggestions. I would double the recipe for this much meat. It was barely enough to coat 2 1/2# of meat and I still had to add some water after a few hours because the top layer of meat was drying out. Also I would cut the salt in half or delete it altogether. I used 1 tsp. for 2 1/2# of meat and it was still too salty. I doubled the garlic as I didn't think I'd be able to taste it at the suggested amount and it was perfect. I also used Thai hot peppers instead of cayenne substituting 4 peppers per teaspoon -- I chopped them up with the garlic and onion. It was pretty warm but I like that! With the recipe doubled for the amount of meat the spices were just right very fragrant and the meat was so tender from the yogurt. I marinaded for 12 hours and it was terrific. The last comment I have is that I might try grilling the meat next time because in the skillet when the marinade boils the yogurt curdles. Overall I think this recipe is flexible and forgiving and the flavor combination is exotic and thoroughly enjoyable!",

And the smell of the marinating meat was a great indicator of how it was going to taste. I only had half a pound of lamb but I did not scale down the sauce to a tenth -- I like sauces with my food. Also: I did not use a tablespoon of salt -- I used just a teaspoon and it was fine. If I had 5 lbs of meat I probably would use more. Finally I only had whole spices. I guessed on the conversions and tossed them all in the grinder. And because my lamb was very thinly sliced (paper thin) I only left this in the marinade for about 3 hours. My cayenne was probably old -- I used a full teaspoon and the dish was not hot.. I'm sure if I let it sit overnight the flavors would be intense but I was hungry and did not have the foresight to refrigerate this the night before. I did not have this as a shawarma but as a dish of meat and sauce over bulgur. If I do decide to have shawarma I might just scrape off the extra marinade before I grill this. This dish was superb!",

The recipe is good but next time I would cut the lamb into chunks and grill them on skewers. I made the pieces to flat and they were immediately overcooked. Plus it grilling would have preventing them from almost steaming in the grease that came out of them as they sat cooking in the pan. I would also cut back the salt to 1 teaspoon. Not sure why the salt content is so high unless it's for tenderizing which didn't work for me since I overcooked the pork. I'd try it again tho",
