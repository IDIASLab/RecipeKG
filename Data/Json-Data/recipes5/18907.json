        "description": "In the spirit of fall here in the Pacific Northwest, here is a recipe of my friend Joe's own design! He sought to bring bacon to the dessert menu, and hunted for a pie media capable of sustaining a bacon infusion while retaining deliciousness. Pumpkin (perhaps rhubarb) is the only one he could think of. I offer this recipe to all you bacon lovers out there. Remember though, you might steal this recipe to publish it and make dirty millions, but the true bacon lover cares not for cash but only for cholesterol. Enjoy bacon lovers of America!",

Adjusted the recipe to make \"9 servings \" which made one decently filled 10-inch springform. Used a little more than the full amount of bacon for 9 servings but cut it into bite-size pieces for managability - glad I did. Used canned pumpkin cuz I had some. Omitted the allspice & clove cuz I don't care for it so much. The rest of the recipe was made as directed - and it is delicious. This particular recipe may not be for you but it sounds way weirder than it tastes. And pumpkin and bacon absolutely DO go together - there are many many recipes that support it. Thanks for the recipe - I'm going to do one of these at Thanksgiving!:)",

Just remember to cut the sweetness and spices or your pie will taste like dessert with bacon=yuk. We omitted the vanilla extract ginger and cloves and cut the brown sugar to 1/2cup and half/half to 2/3cup to make pie less jiggly. Added some chopped onion-to your own taste-and a 1/4tsp. nutmeg. My sons ate it all at one sitting. You can subs. shredded cheese for some of the cream cheese called for maybe 3/4 cup haven't tried it yet.

(we added cool whip to the top. see below) i followed the recipe exactly (cutting it in half though for one pie instead of two) except for the pumpkin. i just used 1/4 can of pumpkin instead of cubed pumpkin. we also cut the bacon into bite-sized bits to place in the pie rather than 7 whole strips. everything else i kept the same and it turned out yummy. my husband and i both felt it needed to be a bit sweeter though to match the salty bacon. overall the flavor of the pie was more savory rather than balanced between sweet and savory. we added cool whip to the top and that gave it the right amount of sweetness that it needed before having to tweak the recipe:) overall though it was good!!!:D very interesting flavor combo and we liked it!",

I bought some fresh bacon from my grocer's meat department and chopped it up into small bits. I cooked it for just a few minutes before I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar all over the bacon bits. I cooked them until they were dark and sticky. I sprinkled the \"candied bacon\" around the outer edge of the pie then baked it. In hindsight I would have cooked the pie somewhat before adding the bacon to make it more of a topping than part of the pie mixture. My family was apprehensive at first but after one bite they were sold!! I'll be doing this again next year!!!",
