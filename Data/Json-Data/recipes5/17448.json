I poured the juice from the can in because I like juicy crisp desserts.  I added no additional sugar.  Put the crisp all on top and used the same size pan called for in the recipe.  It was perfect!",

This is GREAT and easy!  The only change I made was to add some almond paste to the crunch (thanks, Marie C!) as I'd planned to add almond extract but found myself out of it!  I couldn't find any of my 8X8 pans, so I needed to use a larger pan and, as such, used 2 cans of filling but left everything else the same.  Awesome.  We liked it so much, I made it 3 days later for Christmas.  When I made for Christmas (in 2 pie plates because I still can't find any of my square glass pans!), I accidentally used a jar of RED RASPBERRY filling in one pan and I think I actually liked that even better.  All in all, a great simple recipe.  THANKS, Timothy!",

The butter,flour, sugar and oats are the same, but I don't use cinnamon and I DO use 3/4 t. baking powder and 1/4 t. salt.  I just happened to have made this tonight and then saw the photo.  One thing that I might recommend is to mix the crumbs with your hands.  The warmth of your hands softens the butter and makes nice little clumps instead of dry powdery crumbs.",
