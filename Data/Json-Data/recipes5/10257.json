I use a can (12 oz) of evap milk with 8 oz Monterey jack. The thickness seems to change each time, so I just add cheese or milk at the end till it is right. I add a lot more cayenne (1/4 tsp) to make it spicy enough. I definitely recommend using evaporated milk if you try this recipe. That is the standard for smooth queso dips and it will make it basically impossible to end up with a grainy dip (which I ended up with when I made the recipe with regular milk).",

Only thing I changed was I used two chocolate poblano peppers and two roasted chocolate habanero peppers as that's what I had fresh from my garden.
