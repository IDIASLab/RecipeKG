I added a 1/4 cup of raisins a sprinkle each of sea salt coarse ground black pepper paprika red curry powder ground red pepper sesame seeds and about 2 additional tablespoons of mayo to compensate. I swear it tastes better than any tuna egg or chicken salad I have ever made. I never knew it could be done better with tofu! This one even without altering the recipe is a keeper in my honest opinion.",

If you don't want to freeze you can press the drained tofu between two plates putting some weight like a couple of cans on top of the top plate. Do this for about 30 minutes. It gets quite a bit of moisture out. Freezing is best because it actually changes the molecular structure of the tofu and gives it a firmer texture. Yummy recipe thanks so much!",

The only thing that would have made this better is if you didn't have to plan ahead and freeze the tofu. I'm afraid that it would turn out soggy though if you didn't do that step.",

I found if I sliced the tofu 1/2\" thick and microwaved on low for a couple of minutes until it was hot throughout I could then press the slices between two plates and the excess water would squeeze out. A bonus was that the tofu no longer had a raw beany taste. I also tried a seasoning variation. Instead of the mayonnaise I used 1/3 c. Miracle Whip and replaced the soy sauce and lemon juice with 1 Tbs. ketchup and 2 tsp. grated horseradish for a lightly sweet/sour/zesty flavor. The ketchup makes the sandwich filling a little pink that looks appealing. Thanks Judy for a whole new use for tofu.",

I love tuna salad sandwiches but hate to have to wait so long between having them(due to amount of mercury in tuna) this will be a great replacement.",
