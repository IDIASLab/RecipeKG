I used two 14 oz cans of salmon but I only used 2 eggs (instead of 4). If I had used 4 it would have been too guey. You will have to spot this recipe in terms of how much crackers (for consistency) vs. pepper (how much spice) vs. how much egg (how moist) to your liking. Nonetheless my family ate it with pasta and corn. Very quick and easy dinner which is always a winner in my book.",
