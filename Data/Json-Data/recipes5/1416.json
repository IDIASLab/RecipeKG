                "reviewBody": "I love how simple this recipe was to pull off, especially if you can find pre-butchered chicken tenders like I found at Aldi. \n\nThe 1 to 3 ratio of pesto to mayo is super easy to remember and easy to scale up or down. Then breadcrumbs and bake for 15 minutes? Perfect for a back pocket dish!\n\nI made a few tweaks to the recipe: I used whole wheat panko for the bread crumbs to add a bit more nutrition, and I seasoned the breadcrumbs to ensure they weren't bland. I used about a teaspoon of Johnny's Garlic Seasoning and spread to accent the flavors of the pesto with more garlic and parm, but you could easily use garlic powder and salt instead.\n\nI also wanted to make this a healthier dinner, so I roasted some haricots verts (French green beans) and cherry tomatoes with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper at the same time. After the chicken was cooked through, I placed the veggies under the broiler for 3 extra minutes to get a bit more color and they were perfect!\n\nI definitely recommend lining your sheet pans with parchment paper for super fast clean-up. If you do, this is a recipe I would definitely classify as a \"Weeknight Wonder!\" It was on the table in 25 minutes flat, was loaded with veggies and lean protein and cleanup took just a few minutes. HOORAY!",
