We love guac so we decided to try this. \nWe used a jalapeno as that was the only pepper I had on hand. We also didn't quite make it to a tablespoon of mint as our mint plant didn't have enough leaves.\nIt turned out great. The mango and mint are subtle. The flavors blend wonderfully. I'll be keeping this for future mangoes which end up in my possession.",
