I did experiment a little the second time because I like mine a little spicy. I added a dash of crushed red peppers along with some horeseradish and it turned out good too. This is one of those kinds of recipes where if you like venison this makes it even better and if you don't like venison well you can tolerate it. With hubby being a hunter you can be sure I will be making this recipe time and time again. Thank you!",
