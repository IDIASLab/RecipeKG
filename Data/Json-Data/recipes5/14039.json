While it was slightly time consuming (browning the meats) this is by far the best sauce I have ever had (and I grew up in an Italian family!). It is worth the work and everyone that tastes this sauce absolutely loves it. I put in more garlic because I am a garlic lover and used pork chops (because I don't even know what Pork Neck Bones are and couldn't find them!). The meat added the most incredible flavor to the sauce and the pork literally fell off of the bone because it cooked so nicely in the sauce. I highly reccomend this recipe and it is the only recipe for sauce that I use now.",

Hubby AND son told me that it was really good (and hubby is not fond of change..especially when it comes to his favorite which is spaghetti sauce). A keeper in my book thanks Flocco!!

The browning of the meats is very time consuming. I chose not to use the wine and substitued chicken stock instead. The flavor was OK I think that I would only make this recipe when I'm in the mood to cook most of the afternoon.",
