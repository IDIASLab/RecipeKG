I had a hard time cutting the eggplant 1/4\" and so mine ended up a little fat which made them harder to roll. There was a ton of directions and even though I am a pretty fast cook this took me around 1 1/2 hours to make and clean up all the dishes. So do this when you have plenty of time to cook but the dish was enjoyable and a nice change of pace from the typical dinner ideas. If I would change anything it would be to cut the salt in half because it did seem slightly salty.",

My whole family (vegetarians carnivores) loved it (although I did add ham to some of the roll-ups for the carnivores). I agree with other reviewers' comments about how long it took to make (frying the eggplant took a lot longer than I expected although I really liked using the ziploc bags to help with the breading). Frying the eggplant also took me somewhat more than 1/4 cup of oil so be aware of that. Overall though yum!",

I selected this recipe because I had several boxes of frozen sliced Italian breaded eggplants. I fried the eggplants as per the recipe but because they were sliced the short way I l layered them in my baking dish kind of spread the cheese and egg filling on top layered the rest of the eggplant slices on top and then poured the sauce. It saved me about half an hour doing it that way. I will definitely be making this again! (PS: I like spicy so I put some curry powder just on mine to try and it was really good!
