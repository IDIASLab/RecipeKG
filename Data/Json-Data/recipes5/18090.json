For variety I've tried adding almond slivers coarsely chopped nuts and chopped cranberries. So far all have turned out good. Better than store bought definitely but you've got to tweak it to your liking. To SueB if you reduce the sugar by too much it can get crumbly coz sugar is the binding agent here. What I did was to spread the dough out thinner and it became crispier. But because I halved the sugar I replaced 2 tbps of the oats with 2 tbps of corn flour to help bind the cookie. Mine have always turned out all right. To those who think this is not healthy because there is too much butter actually from what I've read butter is a lot healthier than margarine and spreads that are mostly made from hydrogenated oils. This recipe baked with added fruits and served with a glass of milk will be a very nutritious breakfast or snack for anyone young or old.",

(the store ones do not have oatmeal) They tasted really great but I would not compare them to the store bought ones. These ones had a little too much of the brown sugar taste. I wonder if it would make a difference if I used half brown and half white sugar. All in all these were good however I would not call them nutritious seeing how much sugar and butter they have in them. I would make them again.",
