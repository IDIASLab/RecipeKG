Yeah it was bad like absolutely horrible crab was not expired or anything it was just bad! I followed recipe to a tee and it was just bad. If you cant find or afford REAL crab use some of the imitation crab and add some cream cheese to the mixture. Also I recommend adding a little sugar maybe a tablespoon or so to the corn mixture... it's too dull and boring if you use the imitation crab if you use real fresh crab let the crab be the star.

I liked the pepperjack cheese in it for a kick too! I'll be keeping this recipe and making it again when we get more fresh crab!",

They came out with a nice golden color. I will try this again and tweak it along the way. I'm going to make my stuffing more of a crab cake concept. Once I try it again I will repost.",
