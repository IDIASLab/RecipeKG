I used a 46 oz of V8 vegetable tomato juice, 1 cucumber, 1 avocado, 1lb of cooked, frozen shrimp that I defrosted under cold water, half of a red onion, half bunch of cilantro, 1/4 lemon juice, salt, pepper and about 1/2 to 1 tsp of cayenne pepper as well as a tsp of worchestire sauce.  It turned out so well.  Be cautious if you choose to put cayenne in it.  As I was making it, it didn't taste very spicy at all so I added a bit more but as it sat in the fridge to chill, the cayenne assumed its full potential and was hot.  We love spicy food and it wasn't too spicy for us at all, but wanted to tell others in case they used it and couldn't taste the flavor as they were preparing it.",

If you want to make it as such, add extra lime, a little salt to taste, and here's the trick: either add the juice of a can of jalepenos to taste (just the juice!) or a few dashes of Tapatio. I use both. All you need is a package of saltine crackers and a nice cold beer for the perfect summer treat!",

I also added celery salt, a couple of tbp of EVOO, a tbp of worcestershire (figure it's good in bloody mary's so what the heck), some diced yellow bell pepper & a smidgeon of hubby's hot sauce (it's  garlic, serrano peppers, bell peppers & onions, roasted & pureed). I made it up & let it meld in the fridge for a couple of hours & then gave it a squeeze of lime  before I served it in chilled bowls. This is a very filling, satisfying gazpacho ...all the accompaniments it needs is some toast & a glass of sauvignon blanc. Thansk for a great recipe Dawn...we really enjoyed it!",
