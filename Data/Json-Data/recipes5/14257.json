                "reviewBody": "This was an OK potato dish but there are several things that I would change. I used an 8-oz pkg of cremini mushrooms and that was more than enough for 1 pound of potatoes. I thought the halved mushrooms were too big so I'd quarter them in the future. Also rosemary is a strong herb and it just dominated so I'd cut it back to 1/2 tsp. The overcooked chopped onions were almost unrecognizable after being cooked at 450 degrees and I would have liked to bite into a piece of onion. So I'll either cut the onion into larger pieces or add them later in the cooking process. Nice blend of herb-honey flavor easy to put together and quick to come out of the oven. I will try this recipe again with the changes noted above. Thanks Rebecca for the new potato-mushroom dish.",
