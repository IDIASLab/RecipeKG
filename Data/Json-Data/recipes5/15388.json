I might try the recipe again, with half the recommended cheese.  I used the specified 4 Tablespoons of chopped garlic, and again, it was too much, for us.  As with the cheese, I think 1 Tablespoon would be ample.  My only deviation was to put the chopped garlic in the butter and cook for about 2 minutes, before the flour.  This took some of the edge off the garlic, and I'm really glad I put it in early, to give it some extra time to cook in the butter.  I cooked the recipe on High for 4 hours, and the sauce separated, perhaps because there was not enough flour to hold all the fat together, during the cook.  The potatoes were done, not mushy, still al dente, which we prefer.  I am glad to know this dish can be prepared in the slow cooker.  Thanks for sharing you recipe!",
