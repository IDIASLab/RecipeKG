I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts and chicken broth instead of water.  Be careful!  My sauce burned very badly. Maybe because I used chicken broth instead of water or maybe the hear was too high.  The optional garnishs of olives, parsley, and artichokes really make this dish.  Delicious when served with saffron rice.  Thank you!",
