One batch as written and for the second batch, my husband added 3 dark chocolate chips to each tassie before adding the batter and pecan.  Both batches were delicious.  Also, we used a \u00bd teaspoon of chopped pecans and \u00bd tablespoon of batter for each tassie.  Using these measures made the assembly process faster.  To form the little shells:  We just put a plastic sandwich bag over the top of an unopened bottle of marinade.  Just invert the bottle and press it into the dough ball.  This forms a decent shell rather quickly. ",
