I can't really think 'carrot cake' when I eat this, but it is the most amazing spice and texture experience I've ever had with cake! :)  I baked the batter in muffin cups for nearly 30 minutes to make sure they wouldn't be gooey, and they turned out perfectly.  Moist and delicious. The molasses is a heavy flavour (I love it, but not all my family can appreciate it) so I think I will try substituting honey or agave nectar next time and see if it results in a lighter, more typical carrot cake.",
