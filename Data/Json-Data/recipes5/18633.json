Why mess with \"perfection\"!! DH called me at work to tell me how \"perfect\" this dish was. He absolutely loved it and he is the one that gave it this rating. Thanks for a super easy tasty dish. Make sure you do the \"dip\" part i.e. thickening of the marinade. DH says it was totally awesome even without but loved it even more with the \"dip\".",
