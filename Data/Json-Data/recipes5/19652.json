I followed the recipe to the letter except for adding some sliced red bell pepper for a little more color. The dressing is very good the powerful sesame oil doesn't overwhelm and the tart lime juice is just another layer of flavor. Thanks Denise this is a keeper and going into my Asian noodle salad folder.",
