The flavor for me was fine..the thing that didn't go over well for me was the texture. The thing I like about Bundt cakes made with butter is the edges get a crispness that I really like... this did not have that at all. The cake was just soft... all soft. I think having soft edges would have been ok if the cake had some almonds or something.. anything to supply some texture but there was nothing. If you like all soft cakes this would be a good cake for you.. not so much for me as written",
