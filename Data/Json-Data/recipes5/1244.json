A great way to use up leftover ham. I've used diced ham, however cubed ham work better as the meatballs keep their shape better.

                "reviewBody": "Recipe creator here! If your meatballs are dry, you are likely overcooking them, or using too lean of ground chicken. As is the norm with keto, try using a fattier blend of ground chicken, which uses dark meat (85% lean), instead of using pure ground breast meat (98% lean).  As for the cheese not melting properly, I would encourage you to use a finer shred size and to only add about 1/4 cup cheese at a time, whisk to incorporate, then add more until completely added. Also, using too high heat will cause your cheese to seize up and not melt properly, so heat gently and as evenly as possible while the cheese is melting. Enjoy!",

When I started to put the chicken mixture and ham into meatballs the idea of biting into a chunk of ham in the center did not appeal to me. I cut the ham into 1/4\" cubes or so--mixed it all together and cooked them. I found I needed much more than 1T of olive oil and almost double the suggested 3 minutes on \"each\" side. Balls do not have \"sides\". My second semi-con I prefer my sauce a little thicker. I wondered how the sauce would thicken with no thickening ingredient. It didn't. I much prefer to have the sauce cling to the meatballs. That all said the meatballs with the small ham cubes mixed in and accompanied by the sauce made an extremely tasty entree. I now know why there are mistakes in raters' reviews. This setup makes it impossible to go back and edit my review. Very annoying.",
