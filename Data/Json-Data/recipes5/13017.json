My husband doesn't usually like chicken and dumplings, but he absolutely loved these and asked for seconds (which he never does with anything). My little boys (2, 4, and 5 years) ate it up and asked for more also. I just threw this together on a night I didn't feel like spending much time and energy on cooking. This is great and easy for the kids to help with also.",
