Yes it takes a while but you can reasonably break down tasks simultaneously. So that not much prep time is needed and much of your dishes and waste are already dealt with before the meal is prepared. This meal was incredible. It's better than most restaurants. I used a stock pot for the first step and a dutch oven for steps three through six. In hindsight I wish I had used chicken broth instead of water in step one. Even without I am telling you this stew is incredible. The combination of herbs is good. One set of herbs (tarragon rosemary herbes de Provence) reminds me a little of absinthe for some reason while the others added plenty of spiciness. I highly recommend this meal. It deserves WAY more reviews. It is spicy hot as some noted but not overly so. If one doesn't want it they could probably leave out the cayenne pepper. I think the cayenne pepper makes it perfect however.",

For starters there is way way too much pepper and it overpowers everything else. The last time I was around someone using this much pepper they were heavy smokers and their taste buds were zilched. Start out by reducing the pepper asked to 1/2 or 1/3 and increase or reduce it from there next time. If you try to rush the dish and not let it simmer to thicken then it will turn out very runny. I substitute frozen bisquits and they work out just fine and I like the flavor better than canned biscuits.",

I cannot wait to make this again. I should mention I don't own a dutch oven so those like me can use a stock pot and then throw it all in a roaster when it is time to place in the oven.
