I ended up purchasing a traditional \"Jewish\" cut of short ribs called \"Flanken\" because a lot of meat markets aren't hip to the cut of short ribs that are served in up-scale restaurants these days. Same rib just different shape. I made this cold weather dish in the middle of a hot Sherman Oaks California August and let me tell you that 3 hungry diners were toasting you tonight. Falling off the bone tender saucy meaty and just plain yummy ribs resting on top of mashed potatoes. Odd how I can't even rememember what I served for dessert! Thanks again for posting. Best to you Jeff",

Very easy and tasty! thanks Dave!\n\nUpdate 12/09: hadn't made these in years, but I found the recipe the other day so I decided to make them again. I used pork ribs instead of beef, and nixed the celery because I was running out the door. Oh my goodness these were heavenly! The meat just falls off the bone and they are so flavorful. Husband and kids absolutely loved them too! Baked at 325, and covered with foil for the last half of cooking time. Thanks again for this wonderful recipe!",
