It's been VERY hot here in the Windy City (the thermometer reached 92 degrees today - with full humidity). I needed something to cool me down. I purchased a pint of strawberries a couple of days ago with the intention of making this then. I was so stupid to wait lol!!!:) The addition of Cool-whip takes this over the top (IMHO). I also think using a good quality ice cream makes a HUGE difference. I chose Breyer's (on sale this week even cheaper than the generic \"store\" brand...) and used extra creamy whipped topping (and a tad more of each than called for!). Since I was the only taking pleasure in drinking this (my fiance HATES fruit especially strawberries!!!) I made one serving. Heed my advice: CHANGE NOTHING! You will be richly rewarded if you follow Austin's directions exactly. Thanks SOOO much for sharing your recipe here Mr. Geraldson. This is better than my local diner's shake for sure!:-)",
