It smelled close to the store bought kind. But has it cooked and tasted...it was good but didn't taste like store bought. We totally liked this \"Tweaked\" verison and it's a sinch to make. Super Super easy. I only made half the batch because 1 pound of ground pork is what I had. And having all these ingredients on hand made it a snap to run threw my Ninja Chopper to make sure all the spices were evenly seasoned throughout the mixture. I will make again. But I will say it did leave a slight taco seasoning aftertaste to it which is not a bad thing. It's still a rather good recipe.",
