The second time around I beat the egg whites well past \"foamy\" stage and continued beating until they peaked. That seemed to work much better. One I began adding other ingrediants the peaks seemed to break down. I recommend beating the egg whites all the way to peak or stiff peak and then mixing as little as possible once you begin adding the brown sugar etc. Overall a super easy recipe... once you get the eggs right.",
