It did not work out well and I am an experienced good cook. I followed the direction including the cook times per lb given at the bottom of the recipe-20 min per lb. so 40 min at 500 for my roast and turned the oven off and waited an hour and checked the temp of the roast. 125. The oven was too cool when I got it out to do anything for it so I had to turn the oven back on and try to get it done. Dinner was 30 min late and the roast was still too rare thru about half of it. We sliced off what we wanted to eat but it was a disappointment. Today I'm going to just simmer it in the crock pot on low and try to get some pulled pork for sandwiches out of it. Not likely to try this again.",
