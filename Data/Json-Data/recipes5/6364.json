Although I love melted butter, the two never melded for me, and cauliflower remained my least favorite vegetable until I discovered this recipe from Indian friends. I omitted the chile and prepared it for my brother who cannot tolerate any hot spice, and he raved about it. It's flavorful, and the microwave finish leaves the cauliflower slightly crisp, which we prefer.",

Get the lid on the mustard seed quick, though, or they'll shoot all over the kitchen - lol. I'll use medium heat next time instead of medium high, as the seeds took about 30 seconds to cook, not 2-3 minutes. Also microcooked it for longer than suggested, as we prefer it a little more tender. Notwithstanding, nice recipe.",
