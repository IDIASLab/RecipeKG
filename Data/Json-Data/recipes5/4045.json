Also I didnt have chili flakes so I used hot chili powder and I didn't put sage. And b/c I wanted to thicken up the stew a bit i tossed in a 1/4-1/2 cup of lentils. And I added more lemon juice. And I used a vegetable boullion cube. It came out really tasty! the taste of artichokes with the lemon and tomatoes and chickpeas and chili really good.",

It's all going to come down to the quality of your stock so if you truly use low-sodium chicken broth be prepared to enhance it a bit. I substituted rosemary to make it greek-ish like chicken rosamarina. I agree with Katherine's instincts to add some pasta orzo barley or something to thicken it a bit. If you are not vegetarian this would be awesome with some chicken thighs thrown in. Next time I will add a few sultanas - I think this is a good basic that could benefit from some added zing other than red peppers. I'll definitely make this again as I always seem to buy too many chick peas.",

Using fat-free less sodium chicken broth it didn't need any additional salt or pepper. Thanks for a great new recipe.",

I added some quartered white mushrooms to the last bowl when I heated it up and they were super good so I may add them next time. I also cut back on the chicken stock as suggested by other reviewers.
