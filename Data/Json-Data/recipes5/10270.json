I made it exactly like the recipe, except I added a can of heart of palm( such a great treat) and I added a little pimento (less than a teaspoon, maybe just a little taste) to the cream cheese. It was better than I expected. I served it on mini bagels, with different flavors of crackers, and with fresh vegetables. It makes so much and can be served so many different ways. I am now asked to bring my special dip to everyone's gatherings. I love it! Oh I did cut way back on the garlic. Maybe 2 cloves and very little salt. The cans of artichokes and heart of palm have sufficient amount of salt.I never thought about water chestnuts. What an excellent idea. I am definitely going to add that next time.",
