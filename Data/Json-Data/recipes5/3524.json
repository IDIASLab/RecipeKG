Also garlic doesn't sit well with my husband so I only used a touch of it and substituted half an onion for the rest of it. I also followed the advice of others and cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp because 1/2 seemed like too much for the size of the dish (I think I had less pork than most also). Also needed to add a bit of water to saute because there wasn't enough liquid. It came out perfect! Husband loved it and we will definitely be making this one again.",

                "reviewBody": "I just made these for dinner. I made it exactly as the recipe suggest. I thought they were good but not a 5 star recipe. In the future I plan to change some things. I agree that the lemon was too much ( and I eat lemons raw so I love sour lemon taste ) It did not seem to blend with the other flavors but rather stand out on its own. I love spicy and these were that. If you don't like hot reduce the cayenne pepper. I am actually going to try and make these again tomorrow night. I am afraid if I cut the lemon juice in half there will not be enough liquid to reduce and pour over the chops. I am going to try and do half the amount of lemon juice and the other half chicken broth or boulion. I am also going to lightly brown as the recipe calls for and then I am going to finish them up in a slow cooker or dutch oven over the course of a few hours. I like pork chops much better when they have been simmered for a long time and then maybe the flavors will blend a little more. I will keep you posted on the results. Thanks Sabryson for the recipe it gave me a good thought for tonights dinner. Ok made them again. This time I used all of the dry ingredients mixed them together and rubbed it on the chops. Then I dredged the chops through some flour and fried them on either side for 5 minutes. Then I slow coooked them in the lemon and garlic but this time I replaced half of the lemon with chicken broth!! Hmmm....fall off the bone delicious!! On to chicken!!!",
