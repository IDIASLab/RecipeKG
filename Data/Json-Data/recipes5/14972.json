I've always used one or the other or both but I also always use either russet or Yukon Gold potatoes rather than red skinned. What intrigued me was the idea (duh) of making them ahead of time and then reheating them in the slow cooker. I used the terry towel suggestion, as well as the suggestion to stir them every now and then to prevent them from browning along the edges. As others did, I simply forgot to put the butter in at the last, but with the gravy, the butter wasn't even missed. This method of preparation really eased the busy-ness and hustle-bustle in the kitchen on Thanksgiving day. I'm hooked...I will always make the mashed potatoes this way on Thanksgiving from now on! Thanks for a simple solution to getting rid of at least one step of the Thanksgiving meal preparation. Thanks too, to those of you with the helpful suggestions!",

I too skipped the butter at the end (wasn't necessary).

And it STAYED HOT throughout the whole meal, which is a rarity for any kind of mashed potato dish that I've ever fixed.  One slight problem was that the potatoes didn't mash thoroughly, which left smallish chunks of whole potato in, but even that wasn't enough to detract from the overall experience.  (If you're particular about it, I would suggest running a mixer through it before placing in your Crock.)  I was pinched for time, and set the Crock on HIGH for 1 hour - they still tasted just fine, so I'm not sure 3 hours on LOW is necessary.  (Tip:  halve the time if you're cooking on HIGH - 3 hours on LOW equals 1 1/2 hours on HIGH, just a helpful thing to know when cooking with Crock-Pots.)  Excellent dish.  Thanks, Bwaye, this will be going into my regular rotation!",

My husband tasted the potatoes before I added any butter and he said they were great as they were and since we were going to be serving them with gravy adding butter would make it too rich. I'll be making this again next week for Thanksgiving; I know it'll be a hit and best of all I won't have to be rushing around getting the potatoes ready while company is over. Thanks!\nUPDATE (11/09):I have made this for each Thanksgiving since I first tried them, and they have always gotten many complements. For those that have wondered how much this makes volume-wise, one and a half recipes (so, 12 servings worth) fills up my 6 qt slow cooker. We serve it for 16 people at Thanksgiving and generally have some left over since there are so many other dishes on the table. I have used both red and russet potatoes and always leave the skin on, and it is very good both ways. Thanks again for a great, no-fail recipe!",
