I love the tsaziki sauce and love that I can now make this from scratch. I used Italian sausage instead of breakfast sausage because it is what I could quickly find at the grocerty store and it was perfect as well in this dish. Also I couldn't find pita bread so I warmed some Naan bread on the grill cut it in half and used it as a replacement. The photo I'm uploading is without the egg because it was SO BEAUTIFUL. BTW I made both this dish and the other for my guests to judge between the two themselves while Dinner Spinner was on and yours won as easily as it did during taping. GREAT JOB!!!",

I made with turkey sausage instead of regular pork sausage and used green onions instead of white. I also added a sprinkle of feta cheese. I typically do not like an egg unless the yoke is completely cooked but I cooked this over medium and it was very good. The yoke mixed in with the greens and it became more of a dressing. I can totally see myself making this again. Thanks for the recipe Cliff!",
