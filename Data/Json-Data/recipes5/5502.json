I\u2019ve always liked the combo of green beans and almonds, so when I found this recipe it seemed like exactly what I\u2019d been looking for!  I substituted the canned green beans for an 18 oz. bag of frozen ones- they were out of fresh! After preparing the almond mixture and setting it off to the side, I saut\u00e9ed the beans in a tbsp. of butter and a bit of salt & pepper, in the same pan as the almond mixture. When they were cooked through I added back the almond mixture and worked it through the beans, coating them with the sauce and distributing the almonds evenly until it was looking thick and gorgeous. It was really delicious! Everyone loved it, even my very picky husband! I\u2019ll definitely be adding it to the side dish repertoire!",
