It was moist, but not too moist. It was tender and flavorful with a nice outside crust layer. I am not a drinker; however, I used Budweiser beer as it is the only beer I will use to cook with; what a rich and wonderful match with the wheat flour, and so easy to prepare. I did mix the recipe in my Kitchenaid stand mixer; its appearance was simply gorgeous. This is a definite keeper!",

I added a little salt, pepper and some Mrs. Dash Garlic and herb seasoning in the butter before I poured it on the bread. Next time I may add the Mrs. Dash right in the batter. There isn't any salt in it so you could probably use as little or as much as you'd like. I would make this recipe again for sure.",

Surprisingly delicious, and I'm looking forward to making it again with variations--dill and a handful of shredded Cheddar cheese, or maybe herbs or Italian seasoning. It was a tasty acccompaniment to the Creamy Chicken and Wild Rice Soup. However, both my friend and I thought it was a little on the salty side, so I think next time I'll reduce the salt to 1 tsp., and use 1/4 cup of UNsalted melted butter over the top rather than salted. All in all, a lovely bread I'll be happy to make again, and not just because it's easy and produces a loaf of bread in under an hour. Great recipe, and a pleasant surprise!",
