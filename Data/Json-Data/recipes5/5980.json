But both held their own like a Hula to a full moon black sand beach...  Ok, enough of that! This was really good and fun to make.  I served it with creamed spinach and next time some rice would be nice but today trying to cut back on the carbs. Try this one for a special \"lent\" night dinner with someone special. Mahi Mahi is expensive here in the upper Midwest but I can picture this using whole Trout or even Tilapia filets would be just as fine.  Aloha nui loa",

But the ingredients blended together so wonderfully, I doubt I ever will measure.  I made one change to the directions: my mahi mahi was quite thick so I seared it on both sides and set it aside.  I prepared the sauce in that fry pan.  At the point the sauce started to thicken, I added the remaining vegetables and returned the fish to finish cooking in the sauce.  Delicious!  I think this sauce would also work with chicken breasts as well.  Might also add sliced mushrooms next time.  Will definitely make again!",
