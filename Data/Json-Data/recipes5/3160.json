Much better on a foil lined cookie sheet, or 13 x 9 dish in a 350 degree oven for 25 - 30 minutes till fish flakes easily with a fork. I always serve this with macaroni & cheese. Every one in our house likes this recipe from the 2 yr old & up. You can also use this recipe on the grill.  Put your fish in tightly wrapped foil and grill.",

I will say that I probably wouldn't have cooked it this way if I didn't have a turntable.  It really helps in cooking the fish evenly.  I used white swai, a spice called, \"lemon butter w/ dill\" (I got at a spice shop) sprinkled on both sides along w/ a little parm just on top.  Then I used three thinly sliced pats of butter evenly spaced on each fillet.  Total would be abt. 3 Tbsp.  (So 1/2 c. of butter is w-a-y too much!)  Cover w/ a plastic cover like you use when microwaving liquids and microwaved for 3 min.  Then gently turn over and put the outside edge of the fish inward, keeping the thickest part on the end of the dish and cook another 3 min.  Depending on the thickness of your fillets, you might need another couple of min. but that's all!  It was flaky and juicy and so flavorful!  Plus, it didn't heat up my kitchen while it's 90 outside!",

However I love a golden brown color so I always give it a a shake of paprika and bake quickly on high heat about 15-18 minutes at 400 degrees. The lemon pepper seasoning on fish was something new for me and it was interesting to try. It was okay but for me a little overpowering. I'll stick with the lemon juice dill garlic or California garlic salt paprika and salt and pepper. This recipe has great potential but unfortunately gets only three stars from me for the microwaving and the lemon pepper neither of which are positive contributions.",
