Subbed honey for the agave and added a little vanilla but that's it. I will be making this again for sure.   Have been making this about twice a week and have found that adding a tablespoon or 2 of peanut butter makes it like a PB cup pudding. Yum! *******UPDATE***** I added a little extra soy milk and ran it through my ice cream machine with great results. Kind of like a Frosty but nicer. Also makes killer pudding pops. Sometimes I add granola to the pudding for breakfast, too. I love this recipe.\n*new update*\nDidn't have a banana so I used just the avocado, honey, some nestle's quick (it's what I had), and milk. Better than anything out of a plastic cup. Yum. Next time I'm adding some malt. Thanks, Alex. This is one of the best recipes ever.",

Use one large very ripe avocado, and one barely ripe banana. Note the distinction! Omit the coconut completely. Substitute 1/4 c honey for the agave. Substitute 1 cup vanilla coconut milk for the soy milk. Add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. You wont be sorry!!!!\n\n5 stars for the sheer genius of this recipe! It's healthy and tasty - a true guilt free dessert. A couple things to mention - this is best served very cold. Otherwise the avocado taste comes through a little. Also, if you don't like banana, you may not care for this. The banana flavor is unmistakable. In fact this really should be called chocolate-banana pudding. But really, there are no complaints from me. I liked my bowl clean :)",

A word to the wise:  DO NOT TRY TO SUBSTITUTE OTHER INGREDIENTS. The only people to give lousy reviews are those without the proper ingredients - substitutions with 'raw food' recipes usually don't work as well, so please try it with what it calls for - especially the raw cocoa - this is NOT the cocoa you get from hershey's which is bitter and WILL RUIN this delicious recipe... Rice milk or other nut milk can be safely substituted - but not dairy - defeats the point of raw anyhow... =)  Enjoy, loved it and will be making it many, many more times... =D",

I read it and realised that I had pretty much everything on hand so curiousity got the better of me and I gave it a try. I struggled with how to rate this recipe because I'm not a vegan or a complete naturalist I had to do some substituting which I hate doing when trying a recipe for the first time. I don't even know what agave nectar is so I used honey like others suggested. I used 1% milk since that's what was in my fridge. I also only had sweetened coconut to work with and I assume that raw cocoa powder and Hershey or Fry's cocoa powder is the same thing. The texture was perfect. Nobody will ever mistake the flavour for Jello Chocolate pudding but it was pleasant. Not too sweet but it definitely qualifies to fill a sweet craving. My 2 yr old thought it was the bee's knees. I suppose I could try making this with chocolate milk or adding more honey or more banana... But in the grand scheme of things this recipe acomplishes what it was set out to do be a healthier alternative.",
