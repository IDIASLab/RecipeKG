McCormick now has ground annatto (Achiote Molido), so it's a little easier to find in larger grocery stores.  The second time I made it I used reduced sodium soy sauce, and it definitely cut down on the saltiness from when I originally tried the recipe but kept the same great flavor.  This one's a keeper!",

Last time I made it with chicken this time I mixed pork and chicken and used a slow cooker. It was also wonderful! Since you end up with a ton of sauce I thickened it with cornstarch at the very end and served it over UNSALTED rice. The sauce is quite salty (guess you could use low-salt soy). It's a very satisfying dish with flavor combinations I am familiar with in marinades but yet with the vinegar it turns out to be a very different taste experience...one that we loved! Oh...I wish I could find coconut vinegar but read other adobo recipes and used apple cider vinegar; again delicious.",

The second time I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. I marinate my chicken over night and up to 24 hours and i use air chilled chicken - it sucks up all the marinade so I use only 4 LBs chicken and that seems to work fairly well giving enough gravy to fully cover the rice. I also only use thighs and legs...lots of collagen and it gives the gravy an incredible sily mouth feel. Leftovers were even better than when it was first cooked. SO GOOD!!!",

This time around I found annatto powder and I still added the sweet blend tumeric because I couldn't live without it. Absolutely wonderful and it was an instant hit at home. Thank you.:)",
