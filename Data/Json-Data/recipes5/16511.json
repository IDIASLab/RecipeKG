I used all butter (2 sticks) and used half white/half brown sugar.  I reduced the milk to 1 Tbsp.  Also, I baked these 35 minutes because of suggestions from other reviewers.  THANKS reviewers!",

I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar and added a cup more of chocolate chips which I changed to milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. I made them for my daughters b-day.

I sampled one of the bars to see what it tasted like and you guessed it - grease. I'd make something else but it's 10:35 p.m. and the Scots in me won't allow me to throw them out. (Too cheap!)
