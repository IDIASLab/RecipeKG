There\u2019s a lot of fat that cooks out of the ground beef that IMO needs to be drained.  The recipe doesn\u2019t tell you to do that, but I usually do, but didn\u2019t today. If you brown the fresh tomatoes with the meat, if you drain it, you\u2019re losing all of that sweet juice from the tomatoes. And although the final product was very good, it was greasy. So in the future, I will brown the meat, drain the fat, and then add tomatoes along with the remaining ingredients to simmer. On the positive side, this had very different flavors which we thoroughly enjoyed, and I definitely will make it again.",

The process of cooking onion first and then the rest of spices with the meat, until it has a cooked smell and the oil separates from the meat mixture, is important and has a name ( bhoonna). This can take 10-15 minutes during which the pot has to be stirred intermittently. Oil should be removed after this process to allow for proper fragrance and flavor of the dish. Because the oil separates, the spices are not lost.",
