The difference being,  I used a package of what they call around here, \"Pick of the Chick\" three thighs, three legs and three breasts, all with the bone it. I grilled the legs and thighs over indirect heat for a total of 25-30 minutes. They were done inside and the skin was a golden brown with a little char. They were beautiful! While we ate the greatest grilled chicken dinner ever, with the legs and thighs, I  continued cooking the breasts for an additional 10 minutes for a total cooking time of 40 minutes. I was thinking \"I'm sure they will be sort of dried out like most big breasts with the bone in, so tomorrow we will have grilled chicken salad.\" The next day I took the chicken off the bone, and zapped it in the microwave to take the chill off. I then topped our salad with it and I was simply dumbfounded. The leftover chicken was still very moist, very flavorful and so tender. It was the best grilled chicken salad I've ever had. The negative reviews are crazy. It is simply delicious. This is not a difficult nor expensive recipe to make. The flavor, tenderness and the moistness has made this one of my favorite grilled chicken recipes. Thank you Wilemon for the excellent recipe! I want to come to your house for dinner!",
