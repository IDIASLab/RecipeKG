These are so wonderful, I found them on this site after tasting the same recipe at a popular sandwich chain, called \"Sheila's Dream Bars\" there.  This is the exact same recipe, and it is buttery, but wonderful.  \n\nYou can omit 1 stick of butter without impacting the recipe too much if needed, I also often cut back on the sugar just 3-4 tblsp or so since the filling is so sweet.  It definitely helps to refrigerate the dough for the top layer before adding and try to smoosh it flat and piece together as much as possible.  And definitely keep the filling at least half an inch from the edges, I also press the dough down all around the edges to keep the caramel from leaking to the edge and burning. \n\nI have also started making different variations of these bars with different fillings - strawberry preserves and cheesecake filling, leftover apple pie filling and pecans, leftover bananas foster filling...all wonderful.  They look nice when you wrap them in plastic wrap in squares and are very easy to make - thanks so much for ending my search!!",

Your crust will be dry and won't stick together and they won't be as good. What's the point anyway? I don't get these people who cut down on butter to make something \"healthier.\" Whether you use 1 c. or 1 1/2 c. butter doesn't much matter since it's still butter and still fattening. Have a little piece and enjoy.:) I made the recipe as written adding 1 t. vanilla to the melted butter for more flavor. I also had to cook my crust a little longer (about 12 minutes) to get it golden brown. These bars were crunchy a little salty and sweet - seriously the best cookie bar. The chocolate and caramel blended together and the taste is addicting. The whole pan disappeared in minutes at the office.",
