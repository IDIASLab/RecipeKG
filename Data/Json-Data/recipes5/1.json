I only had salted butter so after calculating the sodium in a stick of my brand vs what s called for in the recipe I omitted salt (the butter itself had a tad more than what s called for). Used 1T vanilla added about 1/2t espresso powder a pinch cinnamon folded in 1/2C chopped pecans at the end. Only used 1 egg the 2nd time making this because I wanted a denser brownie. I failed to adjust for cooking in glass so they were more done than I wanted at 22-23 mins but once adjusted they should be perfect and probably less fragile too (they are pretty fragile like some others mentioned). Everyone really enjoyed them! The perfect amount of chocolatiness and sweetness for me. The only crazy thing I d say I could do to improve them would be to brown the butter then let it cool and use it. Only tricky part to doing that would be to add in the right amount of liquid (like 1-2T milk probably) to account for the moisture lost in the browning process",
