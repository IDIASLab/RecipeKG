I also used margarine as opposed to butter and it still came out wonderful. If you're like me and don't like your sauce with a strong lemony flavor, omit it until the end and just add to your taste.",

I also added a pinch of paprika to give it a little zing.  Tasted great with my sauteed asparagus and mushrooms!",
