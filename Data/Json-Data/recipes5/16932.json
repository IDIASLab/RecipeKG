I rub it with all of the herbs and spices (salt pepper fresh garlic) and then wrap it up tightly in plastic wrap and keep it in the frig for about 24 hours. I let the roast cook for about 45 minutes then add the apples and onions and let it cook for another hour to an hour and a half. I do use a meat thermometer. I spoon the apples and onions into a serving dish put the roast on a platter and then put the roasting pan on the stove and make the gravy right in that so that I get all of the drippings/flavor. In addition to the listed ingredients I add a package of brown gravy mix and it works just great. I always think I will have left overs but there is rarely enough left for a second meal!",

The flavors were wonderful I did marinate it overnight and the only change I made was to the gravy...I too added a pork based gravy mix to the drippings Juice and syrup this thickened and extended it. I also doubled the gravy portion knowing that my guest were big on gravy...so glad I did they loved it!!! Contrary to what some people said no one thought the gravy was too sweet might have something to do with the brand of juice and syrup one uses. Anyway I could go on but just wanted to thank you for helping me out with a very successful dinner party. Jan",

Because we were pressed for time today and this evening I decided to omit the gravy/sauce entirely. I did rub the roast with the herbs salt and pepper and then let it sit overnight in the fridge. When I was ready to put the roast into the oven I chopped up the red onion and a big bunch of celery hearts put this on the bottom of the roasting pan and set the roast on top and then let this bake for one hour. Then I chopped up the apples thickly sliced three large yams and after stirring this mixture up with the brown sugar I arranged the apples and yams around the roast and then poured one cup of apple juice over all. The addition of the apple juice loosened all of the baked bits of carmelized onion and mixed with the drippings from the roast to make a wonderful sauce that I used for basting. I put the pan back in the oven for another two hours (only used a 4-pound pork loin roast) and afterwards enjoyed a terrific one-dish meal. Next time I'll make sure that I have enough time to make the sauce with the maple syrup as I am certain that must be quite delicious as well. Thank you for this great recipe!",

I didn't have the time (or patience) to marinate it overnight so just had the herbs on for a few hours...still tasted great. I used a bone-in pork loin roast and found that the second roasting only took about 40-45 minutes to get to 160\u00ba. Also mine didn't make much drippings so I didn't drain it or I wouldn't have had anything! Used sparkling apple cider rather than juice and as suggested added a packet of brown gravy mix. Made the gravy a bit thick so you may wish to consider adding more liquid. We all loved it...great for family and company alike.",

It kept the meat warm and allowed the inside juices to flavor the meat even more while the onion/apple mixture baked in the oven. My wife and son didn't care for the onion/apple mixture but they have very pedestrian pallets (don't tell them I said that). Their MAJOR loss. I thought it was insanely declicious. I also served Bavarian sauerkraut \"Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe \" and some brown and serve rolls with brushed on melted butter and dried parsley (in the oven for a few minutes) on the allrecipes website--for wonderful compliments to this dish. The herb mixture was dead-on perfect! Nice one!",

The gravy was just too sweet and didn't seem to go well with the onions and apples. I was also disappointed in the way the onions and apples turned out. I had expected something a little more like the flavour of applesauce with the bite of onion for a twist. I will probably use the rub again but next time I will skip the onions apples and the gravy.",
