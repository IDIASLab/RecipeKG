The Italian bread crumbs and spices add a nice flavor, plus I splurged on fresh Romano, yum. Bonus for us is no \"icky bits\"--i.e., little pieces of onion or pepper that my son's persnickety palate rejects. We didn't even add sauce or manage to get them onto rolls for sandwiches, just ate them straight from the oven. 10/10 will make again!",
