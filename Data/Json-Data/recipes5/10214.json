This is also a great review for how to get perfect, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside breakfast potatoes. Even if you don't plan on using the Indian-inspired spices, you'll want to pay attention to the cook-first, fry-later approach. Top potatoes with a poached egg, if you like.",

I left the spices off of my kids' portion during the frying (and kept the 2/3 of spices in the water during the boil) and added some chopped white onion into the boil water as well. I left off the suggested toppings. The kids seemed to really enjoy with some ketchup on the side. I told them that next time I'd follow the instructions more closely.",
