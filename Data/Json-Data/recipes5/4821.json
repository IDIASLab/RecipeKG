But after a few bites it really grew on me and I eat it all the time! I do find that it takes about 1/2 cup of water to make it the right consistency and it definitely tastes better after it's chilled overnight. The ripeness of the avocados can also make a difference in taste; it tastes too \"green\" if they aren't fully ripe yet. I also find that the quality of the maple syrup makes a difference 100% pure maple syrup giving the lightest and most pleasant taste.",

It's not exactly what you'd expect and it sure beats some other vegan raw food choices hands down. I choose to leave out the lemon. If I'm hankering for some chocolate and fat I go back to this recipe. Stick with full fat avocados; the low fat ones are not thick enough to make this work. FREEZE THE AVOCADOS first by tossing them in the freezer with the peels on. This makes a super cold chocolate sherbert/icecream.",
