I didn't add salt I only used 1 tbs EVOO and I used 1/2 cup of plain non-fat regular yogurt(not greek)instead of sour cream. This cut the fat by 70% and the consistency stayed the same since regular fat-free yogurt is runnier than sour cream thus less oil is necessary. I served right away without refrigerating.",
