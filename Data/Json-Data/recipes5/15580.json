I had some leftover brown rice, so I added that for a little more substance. I tried a little with shredded colby-jack and some sour cream and they were even better!  I'm so happy to have another healthy,(minus cheese and sour cream), easy dinner option!",

I keep this on hand and use when needed. \nAlso used the tip from another review and let raw shrimp marinate a bit with chopped cilantro and a little lime juice (not too long or you have ceviche, which can be good, but just not here)",
