I made a variation last night & dint mind extra clean up since I had the cast iron skillet already dirtied so I crushed up an entire family sized bag of the original Doritos dumped them in the skillet after removing the meat (used ground pork AND ground beef extra yummy) dumped the mixture on top & added all imaginable toppings to that (I love adding black beans kidney beans avocado & dirty rice) before slathering the entire thing with an entire jar of salsa con queso lol then I baked it in the oven @ 400 degrees till the exposed chips get browned & crispy. Then I just plop the entire skillet on a folded dish towel in the center of the table & devour it upon paper plates.... makes meeeeeee mouth water everytime lol.... my nephew loved it & called it the magical taco mountain... I mean it hovered a good 3\"- 4\" above the skillet rim.... no left overs:-( makes me sad I have to wait a cpl weeks for this delicious concoction to hit my table again.... happy eatings everyone:-)",
