There's one non-stellar review on here and it looks like the reviewer may have followed the recipe incorrectly: don't simmer the pineapple in the butter! First brown the butter and only after that process is complete and the brown butter is removed from the stove do you add the chopped pineapple. You mix them well and then just let that sit for a while (the recipe says 20 minutes which works well). These are great I've already made 2 batches and plan on making several more!",
