City cooks, who couldn't get chicken, would take scraps from much cheaper, at the time, pork and build something similar to what you see here. Why this represents the true spirit of American food is that long after chicken became cheap and plentiful, people kept making and eating this anyway. Serve with honey mustard.",

Then bake for 2 hours in a low oven 275 - 300.  While baking sprinkle 2 or 3 more times with water.  This causes steam in the covered dish and makes the meat so tender it melts in your mouth.  Everyone that tries these says they are the best!  This trick came from a little polish lady from the old country who said this is how the did it way back then and believe me the extra time waiting for it to cook is well worth the wait!",
