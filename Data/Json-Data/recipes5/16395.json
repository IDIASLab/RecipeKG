The cakes themselves did have to cook for about 30 min and I did add more milk as suggested in other reviews. The cake was moist but not super light and tasted like caramel...mmmm. The icing made me a bit nervous as I'd never used a candy thermometer before...and I was concerned after reading other reviews that said it was thin. I used an electric mixer and beat it in the pot after it cooled (which took less than a minute after I removed it from the heat). I beat it for about 3 minutes and then let it rest. It thickened considerably but not to the point where I could use it on my cake so I beat it for another three minutes and let it rest for about 2 more and by then it had started to get the hardened looking top - that was my signal. I briefly beat it one more time (like 10 sec) and then spread it over the bottom layer and then the sides and top. I put in fridge to set though it hardly needed it. It was a super cake just what I was hoping for. Be warned: it's ridiculously sweet! Start with small pieces!",

To the others who rated this cake and it didn't turn out good, you have to follow the directions to the tee on the icing. Invest in a candy thermometer,if not the icing will not turned out right. The heating and cooling process is a must with candied cooking. Co-workers, family and church members loved it made 4 cakes in one week. Experimented with the icing alot, just with how much I whipped it after it cooled down, you can make it fluffy or more like a candied traditional caramel icing, I prefered the candied, that's more like a traditional caramel icing. It's a sweet cake, but caramel cake is sweet.There's nothing light about it.",

The only thing I did differently was I used chocolate fudge frosting instead of the caramel frosting and it turned out magnificent. I also only baked the cake for 20 minuets and it was done. I recommend trying out this recipe. It was a wonderful change from a chocolate vanilla or yellow cake. Next time I make it I might try making a layered round cake. The 9x13 size pan I used made a pretty thin cake and it was hard to get out of the pan without breaking. But I have no complaints at all on the flavor! I will definitely make this again. In fact I already have some requests from the people who tasted it!",
