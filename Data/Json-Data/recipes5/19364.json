I took the suggestions to add a teaspoon of Cinnamon and a tablespoon of Brown Sugar.  I only used 1 teaspoon of Paprika rather than 1 1/2 Tablespoons (?) and also left out the poultry seasoning.  I used Olive Oil, adding only enough to cover the amount of potatoes I had so not quite 3T.  I also oiled the glass dish I cooked them in so altogether, there was plenty of oil to not burn to the dish yet not too much.  I look forward to making this again and using some of the other tips to create different flavors, like using fajita seasoning or steak seasoning instead of poultry seasoning.  This recipe has opened my mind to the options of flavors (not to mention healthier dishes)for Sweet Potatoes, other than the typical super sweet, marshmallows, maple syrup, etc. ",

I omitted the cayenne pepper, the poultry seasoning, and the onion powder, and added 1/2 tsp of seasoning salt. I believe my sweet potatoes were on the smaller side. Instead of baking in the oven, I put the whole mixture in the crockpot for 3 hours and had a lovely side dish. Will be making this recipe again for Thanksgiving this year!",

If you take the time to chop the potatoes a little smaller...then every bite gets more crispy and tasteful. We mix everything in a large ziploc bag and dump them on our baking sheet. Bake them at 425 for 20 - 25 mins flipping halfway through. Easy and delicious! One of our favs!",

I didn't have any sweet potatoes, so I used beets instead, and I didn't have the spices called for, so I used my own mix, and instead of baking it, I boiled it.   Just kidding!  What's up with people who review a recipe like that, having completely changed it?!  I made it exactly as written, although next time, I will be tempted to try some of the spice variations suggested.   After it was done, and after I tasted it, I mixed in some chopped walnuts, because my wife wanted \"sweet potatoes with nuts\".   It was good that way, although I'm sure pecans would be better.",
