To address the scorched smell concerns that earlier posters experienced I think the problem may be due to overcooking the brown sugar? I thought the brown sugar would be a syrup by the time I added the water. However the sugar was bubbling and browning but still in a somewhat solid state when I cooked it. No burned smell and the resulting sauce was so good!",

It really steamed and spit when adding boiling water! The color was darker than I expected and I was wanting a lighter taste and appearance. Mine also seemed to have a slight burnt flavor. Don't need to cook for 5 minutes! I agree that adding some heavy cream would make it richer. I also added Cinnamon Plus from Pampered Chef's spice collection and added chopped apples. Those were nice additions. Next time I will reduce cooking time and try again.",

I threw that batch out and tried it again. This time I didn't cook the sugar mixture that much but when I added the water it still gave off a slightly burned odor.
