I would rather brown the thighs but put the mustard AFTER they are browned. The other option is to lower the temperature to brown them but that defeats the purpose or searing them. As of everything else it is fine I do however it might end with too much sauce. Depending on the side it might be OK especially if served with pasta. I served it with Carrot Rice from this site which I made without using the pureed toasted peanuts. Both mild flavors blended well. This will absolutely be in my regular recipes it has all the potential for a nice dinner!",
