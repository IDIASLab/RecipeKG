VERY IMPORTANT: there can be NO fatty residue on any of your equipment and not even a SPECK of yolk in your egg whites or peaks won't form. The whites just won't fluff up is there is any fat whatsoever! And it's surprising how little fat it takes to ruin your meringue. So...be careful wash your utensils (even if they're already clean) before you make this. You'll love it!",

It looked similar to the picture of the first one showing soft peaks and I was pleased with the recipe. I used Maple Flavor instead of Vanilla since it was going on a Maple Bacon Cake. (Also from Allrecipes). Thanks to all of the contribu- tors of tips to ensure success. The one I just read after I made it who cooked it for 7 minutes then transferred into the mixer bowl would have solved my issues & the addition of 1/4 tsp Lemon Juice to the water giving stiffer peaks might also be something I ll try. Anyway my Daughter loved her Birthday Cake.",
