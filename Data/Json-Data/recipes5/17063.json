It knocked my craving for oatmeal ccokies that I have been having for a couple weeks. I highly recommend this one!",

I don't mind the flavour of them although they aren't the most flavourful cookie I've ever had. Good for babies with the soft cake-like texture. I found them a little better if instead of dropping them you spread them out a bit so that they bake flatter. I only added chocolate chips to mine but I will make them again. I liked the suggestion of using flavoured instant oatmeal instead of regular oats - I will probably try that next time to see what it does to the flavour. Before you condemn this recipe try it at least once. Especially if you have very young children.",

If the chocolate chips weren't in them they would have not been sweet at all. I didn't find these to be chewy either - they were much more cake like. I'm not sure if that is because I used regular milk instead of \"sour milk\"? Not sure if sour milk is milk going sour? or if you are supposed to buy \"sour milk\"? Anyways - I don't think I'd make these again even though the children liked them - I much prefer a more chewy oatmeal cookie - so I'll be searching for a new recipe.
