The first time I made it I just had some leftover ground chuck from another recipe so I had to adjust the portions. The next time (still using the leftover ground chuck from another recipe) I doubled all except the meat again and added a little imitation maple flavoring as I sometimes enjoy maple sausage and it was good as well. I definitely recommend this recipe just double spices.",
