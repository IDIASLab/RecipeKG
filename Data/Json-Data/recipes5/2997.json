I was tempted to dock it a star just for calling for vegetable oil in the dressing (I used olive oil) but all the positives more than outweighed this one little negative. Beautiful fresh perfect blend of flavors and colors and extremely good for you too! Other than using olive oil rather than vegetable oil and thinly sliced red onion for the chopped onions called for I made no other changes or additions. Why mess with perfection? Loved loved loved the dressing - so light and fresh tasting! Rather than tossing the salad I made individual servings on salad plates topping each bed of spinach with the remaining ingredients. This made for a beautiful presentation. Thanks for sharing this keeper recipe Dee J - we cleaned our plates!",
