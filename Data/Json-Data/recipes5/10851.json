We cut it into 2\" x ~0.75\" strips and made little street tacos out of it. I'm pretty sure that's not an authentic Cuban thing to do with it, but no one could argue with the result.  tasty it was.",

I left the remaining meat marinate for another day & it was even more tender.  Now flap meat is very thin, so it wasn't going to be juicy like steak, but it was not dry, grilled very quickly &  was so so tender that you can just bite right through it vs sometimes having to semi gnaw to finish breaking off your taco bites- if that makes sense.  Definitely a keeper",

I always make a new recipe exactly as written so I have a baseline. But I did make two \"sort of\" changes. First I marinated the steaks for about six hours simply because I had free time in the late morning. I recommend that because I believe it tenderized the meat even more. (Also it makes it easy to make these on a weeknight). The second \"change\" was that I broiled them instead of grilling - they came out beautifully! As I mentioned the flavors of the citrus cumin and other spices layer perfectly so that one doesn't dominate. One thing puzzled me: If you're grilling or broiling where do you get the \"accumulated juices\"? I solved that by boiling the marinade down a bit and sprinkling it over the steaks along with the olive oil. The cilantro and lime slices are a must - they just add that extra zip that makes this recipe worthy of a restaurant meal. The kids loved it too! This will definitely be a \"go to\" recipe from now on.",
