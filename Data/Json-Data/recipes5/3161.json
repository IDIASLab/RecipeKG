In addition I also used a half can of diced tomatoes and some crushed red pepper. I also didn't simmer as long. I think clams get rubbery if cooked a long time so I didn't chance it. I just served it when the corn was done which was after about 10 min. Everything else in the recipe I kept the same. Delicious!",

Instead of using 1/2 cup of corn I used a can of corn water and all. Because of the water in the corn and the juice from the can of clams I didn't add the cup of water to the soup before letting it simmer and it came out perfectly. I also added some hot red pepper flakes for a little heat and thought the sweetness of the corn and the spicy pepper complimented each other well. This one's so good and so easy to make. I can't recommend it enough.",

Oh and I use a 12-oz can condensed milk instead of cream and dried instead of fresh basil (because they're always in my pantry like all the other ingredients of this soup).",

If you do want the soup to be more about the clams add at least one or two more cans. But what I'm going to do is save my money and not buy the clams next time and just enjoy a creamy tomato soup. Oh and the butter--totally useless. Usually in most recipes I tend to reduce the butter and I thought about doing that for this recipe and bringing it down to one TB but I was afraid I would sacrifice flavor so I went ahead and used it. However since I couldn't taste any hint of it through the overwhelming taste of tomato sauce I'm sure even sauteeing the onions in a little EVOO would have done the trick. Overall good recipe just a little too tomato saucey and not much else.",
