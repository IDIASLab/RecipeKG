I used lots of slivered garlic and sun-dried tomatoes. Love both. We have a big lemon tree so I used the juice of a large lemon instead of limes.

I actually prefer cooked kale over cooked spinach (although I love raw spinach) because the kale doesn't become so wilted and mushy. It's a pretty dish especially with the sun dried tomatoes. My only complaint -- kind of sour and I would cut back on the lime juice next time. I also like the suggestion of including feta cheese...maybe even instead of the lime juice. Easy to make!

I steamed the kale first and only use 1/2 of a lime. I grilled a marinated chicken breast and corsley chopped a few cashews. I topped the kale and broccoli dish with slices of the chicken and sprinkled the chopped cashews over the top. Yum!",
