They always want to know why our hummus is a dark brown color. It's the olives! The recipe is equally great without the olives and/or feta. Wonderful with pita bread, chips, crackers, or veggies!",

I've done none with fresh basil. One I used canned chopped black olives, store brand. Then no olives. Then kalamata, etc. One without cheese, for a vegan consideration. Etc, etc. Every one is perfect, whatever seasonings you add.",
