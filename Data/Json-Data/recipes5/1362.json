This one pleased everyone! Yay! The only issue I had was the amount of butter. I, literally, poured 1/2c of butter off when it came out of the oven. I'm going to try halving the butter next time. That's the only thing holding this back from being a 5 star recipe for me. Yum! Thank you!!! EDIT: I now make this on a regular basis & use 1 stick of butter only. To us, it's perfection!!",

This is the front runner in the Mac n Cheese competition.  :)  'Really like the ease of prep with this.  I'm tempted to say it's \"Guy-easy,\" but that might not be \"nice.\"  :D  The only thing all tasters agreed on that would be done next time is the put all the cheese in it, not so much on top.  I didn't do the sauce on the bottom.  'Just mixed it together & greased the pan.  I used 1 stick, 1/2c butter, adding 2T to the pasta; only sharp cheese.  My cream cheese was previously frozen so a little funny textured (looked like what Greek yogurt tastes like, if ya know what I mean. :D) so I added 4 ounces, half the block.  The cayenne isn't too hot; but, for little kids, you might want to have half without or less.  PS This is guy-easy!  ;)  Note4Me:  8.14 The sauce needs to be heated enough so the cheese will melt.  It doesn't have to be hot, but melted then added to the pasta.  Kimber liked 8oz uncooked elblows & 6oz uncooked wide egg noodles.  :)",
