What a hit they were!  I don't care for mushrooms myself, but can always recognize a good recipe when I see one!  \r\n\r\nI had at least 8 people make a point of coming up to me to tell me EMPHATICALLY how much they loved the mushrooms.  They would say something like \"I love those mushrooms you made\" and I'd say \"Oh, thanks, glad you like 'em.\" and they'd say something like \"I mean I REALLY like 'em.\"  It's not that often that people go out of their way to comment TWICE on the same dish!  I'll definitely be making this one a staple of my \"party dishes\"!",

I thought the presentation was wonderful, with the colors of the red and green pepper.  Next time, though I am going to cut the peppers into long shoestrings to make the jarred presentation more dramtic.  This is the perfect thing to take to a Holiday gathering.
