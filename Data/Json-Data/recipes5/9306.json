At Fern Bar in Sebastopol, where I stole the idea, they'll switch up the ingredients depending on what's around, as well as change the sauce underneath. Garnish these nuggets with pickled vegetables and olives.",

Both were excellent, though the pork/beef blend was a bit richer. I'd suggest being generous with the spices too! All three times I've made them, I've thought it'd be a good base to which you could add a variety of spices and make them more regional - maybe some garam masala or a Mexican spice blend? Anyway, these are always a hit and we come back to them happily.",
