However I should have listened to other reviewers who said it had too much brandy--I didn't heed their advice as I of am a follower of the line regarding cooking \"When in doubt add more wine/alcohol\"---but 1/4 cup brandy overpowered the flavor of the sauce. If I make it again I will use no more than 2-3 tablespoons of brandy. In addition although the sauce thickened nicely it could be a little creamier so I will use half heavy whipping cream and half milk next time. Finally I think the wording of the recipe needs to be fixed as it says to stir the sauce frequently. This is the wrong wording for this type of sauce. Any sugar-based sauce that is not stirred constantly or left unattended will burn within a minute or two so as the granddaughter or a former candy maker I advise that you continuously stir and scrape down the sides of the pan to prevent burning or else you will ruin your sauce and create a problem when you try to clean your pan.",
