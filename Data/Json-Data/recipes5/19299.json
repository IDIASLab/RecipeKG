I didn't include the saffron which I'm sure would have added a nice flavor but wasn't necessary. I added a little bit more brown sugar than specified since I'm a fan of carmelized anything and it resulted in a bit more of a tangy sweet aftertaste that I thought really complemented the dish well. A great quick delicious recipe! I served three with this recipe and probably could have bulked it up a little bit next time. Everyone wanted seconds!",

I had freshly grated parm/regianno cheese we used at the table and I added just a little extra basil. Wow!",

I used yogurt in lieu of the sour cream I didn't have straining it through a cheesecloth for 30 minutes to remove excess water. Also after cooking the shrimp which only takes a few minutes I removed them from the liquid they had produced and reduced it before adding the rest of the ingredients. Will absolutely make again!",
