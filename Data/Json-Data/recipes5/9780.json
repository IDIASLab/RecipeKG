However, I didn\u2019t have any olives and I wanted to use a recipe that was the very closest I could find to a recipe I\u2019d made and loved several years ago and this one is it. I actually made everything in one enameled cast iron pan for less wash up, and of course mixed my batter in a separate bowl. Other than using a can of drained black beans instead of olives, I made the corn batter with half a cup of flour, half a cup of cornmeal, and about a half cup extra of the milk. I also added a cup of shredded cheese to the batter just because I had the cheese and cheese is life (ha ha). This is such a super fast, easy dish and it deserves reviews because it\u2019s actually better, and more versatile, than the other tamale pie recipes I looked over. It\u2019s a one pan wonder and totally delicious.",
