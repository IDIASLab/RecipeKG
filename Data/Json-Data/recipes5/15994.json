                "reviewBody": "Excellent! I did use the entire packet of taco seasoning and because the avocados at the store were way overripe I left them out and added some cilantro instead. The shells do better at 400 degrees (the recipe submitter has a separate recipe just for the shells and the directions on that one say 400). Here is a tip that I discovered by accident. You can only fit 2 shells on the handle of a wooden spoon. I wanted all 4 of my shells to be done at the same time but couldn't find another spoon that didn't have a funky shaped handle. Out of desperation I started digging around in the junk drawer and saw my wooden ruler and decided to use it. The end result  was a stand up on its own taco shell. How perfect is that? One other recommendation I have is to blot some of the excess grease from the shells with a paper towel prior to forming them around your spoon handle/ruler. This was a great recipe and one I will make a lot. Thanks for sharing!",
