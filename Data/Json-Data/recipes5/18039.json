The next day I poured boiling water over the frozen tofu for a quick thaw. I sauted the tofu in some olive oil to further firm it up, then proceeded w/the recipe. This really improved the texture of the tofu as the first time I made the recipe I found the tofu to be kind of mushy and soft.  The flavors here are great, even better the next day as left overs. Next time i make it I'll increase the sauce quantity because when serving over rice there's just not enough to keep everyone happy!",

I also substituted the bok choy for green cabbage which was very good. 4 cups however I think is excessive. I also fried the tofu first so it held together in cubes and I sauteed the mushrooms in a bit of olive oil and garlic before adding them to the sauce. Served over Jasmine Rice. I ate the leftovers for lunch and they were even better than dinner because the coconut and curry flavors had time to really develop overnight. A great recipe thanks!",

It wasn't quite to my liking because it wasn't solid enough (even over rice) and was just a little bit too spicy. I will make it again but may try searing the tofu in a separate pan to give it a solid \"skin.\" I used extra firm tofu and it still fell apart in the sauce. I will also use maybe 2/3 of the chili paste try adding different vegetables add garlic and more ginger. I agree with a previous reviewer - could use some corn starch to thicken it up a bit. Definitely worth experimenting with though!",

He then said that the Tofu tasted really good and it was okay with him if we had tofu instead of chicken in this dish in the future. This dish was so easy to make. I used canned diced (drained) tomatoes and canned mushrooms because that's what I had handy. I used less green onions and less minced fresh ginger (too lazy to mince more) and added a tad bit more brown sugar. My coconut milk can said \"coconut cream\" but the only ingredient to speak of was coconut milk. This came out so creamy. I suggest adding other spices for those who want a more complex flavor. We cooked and diced potatoes on the side and then added it later. To compensate I added extra curry and chili sauce(brand with the rooster on it). We'll be having this dish again soon!",
