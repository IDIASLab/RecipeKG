Wonderful addition to the regular grape jelly recipes out there with great meatballs....      Based on experience and personal preference with these cocktail meatballs I offer the following suggestions:  1.)  Add one packet of lipton onion soup mix to the meatball mixture if you do not have time to mince or grate the onion.  2.)  Bake meatballs over a drip pan to reduce the fat before adding to the sauce.  3.) If using frozen meatballs ENSURE you DO NOT use Italian meatballs as this upsets the balance of the meatballs and sauce (yuck)!  3.)  Make the sauce the day before to let the flavors marry - I can't stress what a difference this makes!  This recipe gets better the next day.  4.)  The Heinz sauce in the round bottle seems to be the best chili sauce for this mixture.  Reviewers:  I seriously dislike people that rate a recipe based on the changes they have made to the original.  I want to state that I rated this recipe on the recipe Lara submitted.  The changes I suggested were based on my family's personal preference.  Thanks Lara for a fabulous appetizer recipe - I always give you the credit!",

I used seasoned bread crumbs, which added some nice flavor to the meatballs, and then baked them on a broiler tray, which allowed the fat to run off while they were baking.  One recipe is enough to fill one of the small 1 to 2 quart crockpots.  I made the meatballs 2 days ahead, and refrigerated them.  The day of my party, I made the sauce, put the meatballs in the crockpot, added the sauce, and put the whole crock back in the fridge.  About 2 hours before the party, I put the crock back in the warmer, and plugged it in.  Voila!  Easy and tasty.  I was so impressed with the recipe, that I made an extra batch of the meatballs, and froze them.  I will use them for another party in the next couple of weeks.  I'll bet you could use ground turkey for a little less fat.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!",

One thing that would make the recipe easier though, is some explanation of what is meant by \"Chili Sauce\". There are so many types of Chili Sauce out there - after searching, I found that Heinz makes something called \"Chili Sauce\". If you're like me and have never heard of this type of chili sauce, it's basically a vinegar-y, very mildly spiced-up version of ketchup - (sort of like cocktail sauce for shrimp?), w/a ketchup consistency. You can find it next to the ketchup in any big chain grocery. You can't go wrong with this recipe! I'm making it again for New Year's eve!",
