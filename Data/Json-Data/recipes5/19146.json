Imagine my surprise when my hubby who totally hates \"pumpkin anything\" devoured three of these and only left me one! The taste of the pumpkin is perfectly balanced with the suggested amount of spice. Very enjoyable. I highly recommend trying these; you will not be disappointed. Thanks Lin!!!!",

I couldn't get it to come out of my funnel. I resorted to the sandwich bag method which was messy but worked except I think I made the hole too big. In spots the funnel cake was too thick and it didn't cook all the way through. All in all a messy but delicious recipe. Worth the mess! Somewhere between funnel cake and pumpkin pancakes. Whip cream or real maple syrup would have been amazing on it. Rave reviews from my boyfriend and my neighbors.",
