I true to form added fresh garlic to the onions and jalapenos which I sauteed in some olive oil prior to adding the meat and etc. I also adjusted the \"hot\" because I like spicy food but not so spicy that my mouth is on fire. If you're like me try using a 1/4 cup of chili powder 1 tbl. of tobasco 2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and the rest as stated. Next time I might add some chopped celery or celery seed and maybe another can of beer to make it soupier. But I can't rave enough about this recipe! This sounds cheesy but it dances on your tongue! Serve with tortilla chips a dollop of sour cream and some fresh chopped chives! Thanks!",

I read as though it would be \"just right\" for me regarding the spices however for my wife - she doesn't eat the really spicy stuff. So I didn't use the (4) peppers rather I used two of Ortega's small cans of diced green chili peppers. I was more than pleased with how the taste of the chili was on the first day but as with all chili the second day was better yet. I was able to enjoy the heat of the spices which stay on the tongue for a brief moment - not too long to not taste the chili coupled with the sweetness of all the onion and the taste of the beer flavour. My wife enjoyed the taste and complemented the recipie due to the spices not overpowering the taste. That was the moment of realizing chili success.",

I only had one can of diced tomatoes so added one can of rotel cilantro and lime diced tomatoes. I had one pound of ground turkey and just less than one pound of sirloin steak chopped in small pieces. I didn't want to go to the store so had to make do with what I had. My beer was Yuengling and it worked out great. We like spicy but not to hot so added 1/4 cup chili pepper and several dashes of hot pepper sauce (chihula sauce) no pepper flakes or jalapeno peppers just some shakes of red pepper. My beans were one can of pintos and one can of kidney. Many changes but so similar to your recipe. It turned out great and I just wanted to let you know that these small changes can still produce a great chili. If you have a large group to serve you can also cook a pot of white rice and serve the chili on top - really can feed a crowd. I have college age kids and friends and am always looking for ways to feed a lot without too much expense. Everyone raved about the recipe on a cold evening. Update 3/17/14 I am still making this delicious chili and found that a stout beer is the best to use. I follow the recipe as written except for adjusting the spices down a little for our taste. I still get great reviews when I serve this. Thanks again!",
