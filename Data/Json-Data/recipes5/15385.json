What this relatively fast and easy procedure allows you to do is make a single portion of what's very, very close to pizza in a pan on top of the stove in just a few minutes, without ever having to turn on the oven. Serve your pizzadilla with a side salad topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.",

I made up my sauce and dough the day ahead (and zip locked each 1/4 recipe and refrigerated it), then let it come to room temperature before we started cooking our pizzadillas. I set up sauce (Chef John's recipe with San Marzano tomatoes and fresh and dried oregano), mushrooms, sausage, onions, peppers, olives (green and black) and pepperoni so everyone could top their own -- with the recommendation NOT TO OVERDO. It was a hit and a lot of fun. One guest did overdo, though  -- he just couldn't pass up all the various toppings, which probably would have been okay if he had gone *very light* with each, but probably needless to say, he didn't and it was a little bit of a mess when he tried to fold it -- and messed up the pan for the next person (it was an easy clean). I didn't think to snap any photos, but will next time -- soon!",
