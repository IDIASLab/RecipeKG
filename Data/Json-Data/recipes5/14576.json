My first attempt at recipe I used skinned roasted peppers. I had my butcher rough grind my top sirloin steak. Those were my changes I made first go round.  2nd time repeated above and replaced water with prepared coffee and no cayenne pepper, allot more salt and a dash of Emerils Bam. Simmered 3-4 hours stirring every 30 minutes.  I have to stop myself from tasting it as I am entering it in a chili cook off. Feel pretty good about bringing this!!! This recipe needs no luck as it proves itself a winner. Thanks for sharing Scott.",
