Not sure about it's weight but even though we cooked it in the oven for one hour it wasn't completely cooked; I am going to blame this on my oven which is old and seems to cook unevenly. My half was nicely done while his wasn't; the breasts were a little dry. I omitted the grapes since they were optional anyway. Added extra lemon and orange juices to the glaze/sauce which was delicious! Maybe next time I will add some clove or nutmeg for increased flavour and depth. Served this with rice (white rice diced red/green/yellow peppers onion and garlic powder chicken stock water and some of the glaze). This is my first time making and eating a Cornish hen only downside about the fowl itself is that the small bones (rib area) were a little tedious to pick clean. A keeper though that's for sure!",
