I think I made a mistake by using my own breadcrumbs because they didn't really get very crispy, so I'd think that some like the Progresso would work well.  I made my own version of Old Bay seasoning which turned out very similar to the brand name herbs.  The sauce was good, but I did want more flavor on it----some fresh garlic would have been very nice in it.  This is a good recipe, and I'll try it again.  Thanks, Joanne H!",

I reserved some of the crumbs so that when I turned the fillets over after 10 minutes I had more to add to the top. One stick of butter seemed like a lot for a sauce just to drizzle so I halved the sauce and it worked fine and I also added a little garlic powder to it. Nice recipe Joanne H!",

I used panko bread crumbs and added salt to the breading mixture as my panko has much less salt than my normal bread crumbs (not sure if that is typical).  At the very end, when the fish was just about ready to flake easily, I moved the pan up to the broiler and broiled for a minute or two just to crisp up the crumbs.  I am glad I did, for they stay crisp even after drizzling all that butter sauce.  Though, I should've halved the ingredients for the sauce, as I had too much left over.  I added garlic powder, black pepper, and a small pinch of cayenne to the sauce to enhance the favor.",
