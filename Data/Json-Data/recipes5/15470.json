This dip was wonderful, and one friend at the party I brought it to said that I was not allowed to bring the leftovers home.  The only things I did differently was to put the sour cream on plain (no taco mix) and I made homemade guacomole that I put on top of the sour cream.  So the layers went beans, sour cream, guacomole, salsa, veggies and cheese.  I think the homemade guacomole really adds to this dip, and makes the use of the taco packet not really necessary, since you don't want too many competing flavors going on.  Thanks for the recipe...I will use it often!!",
