Absolutely incredible. I used some boneless, thick cut, pork chops which usually come out way too dry for my liking. (Especially when you do them on the grill.) Well, my hubby grilled them and we were OH SO delighted when we bit into that first bite. It was seriously the most moist chop I've ever had! HANDS DOWN!!! What I cannot believe is that just 4 simple ingredients make such a HUGE difference! The only change I made was to use \"low sodium\" soy sauce, and I marinated it for about 4 hours. These chops were OUTSTANDING!!! I think I'll be buying pork chops more often these days!!!",
