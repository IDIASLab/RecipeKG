I cooked a 2 1/2 pound pork loin (tenderloin wasn't as good) cut in half in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low (just pour a beer over it, season it with salt and pepper and throw in some garlic cloves).  Then I shredded it using two forks and put it back in the crock pot and added this sauce in the \"16 serving\" size (1/2 cup of each vinegar).  I like it extra spicy, so I added more cayenne pepper and also some habanero hot sauce (1T-ish).  Just heat it through for 15 minutes and it's DELICIOUS.  Extra-good with fresh sliced onions and cole slaw on them.  Made enough for 16 well-stacked sandwiches.  I'm making this for the next family get together.",

The only suggestion to make it even more \"Carolina\" authentic is to substitute the Tabasco with Texas Pete.  Texas Pete has a little bit different flavor than Tabasco and you will never walk into a \"real\" North Carolina BBQ spot without seeing a bottle of Texas Pete on all the tables.  ",

I followed a recipe on RecipeZaar (at least the cooking part) for a Carolina Style Pulled Pork Sandwich but I used Szeged \"World's Best\" Rib Rub (it is in a can usually in the 'import' section of your grocery store) rather than making my own. Sprinkled that on the pork butt wrapped it several times over in plastic wrap and stuck it in the fridge for 12 hours prior to cooking. Plopped it in the crock pot put 1/2 of this sauce in there and set it to cook for the day. Shredded the meat added some more sauce put it on a roll with some coleslaw spooned on top and viola... a sandwich to rival local restaurants... and most importantly my kids loved it.... ESPECIALLY the sauce!!",
