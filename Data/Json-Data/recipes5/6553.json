That's how I served it, and would in the future, as well.  I did cut back a bit on the tomato sauce, and although the instructions don't say to slice the olives, I did cut them in half. Next time, I will not cook the chicken to a \u201cdeep golden brown,\u201d would just cook until lightly browned.  This mixture simmers for an hour, and the chicken cubes ended up a little tough on the exterior from overbrowning.  Easy to make with a deep rich flavor, just takes some time to \"stew\" (pun intended) for the flavors to meld and the sauce to reduce. I would make this again.",
