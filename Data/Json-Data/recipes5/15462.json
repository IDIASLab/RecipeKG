My \"few changes\" were - I added 2 tsp of Minced Onion (dried spice) and 2 tsp hot sauce while I was browning the hamburger. I stirred in 4 oz (1/2c) sour cream into the hamburger after it was drained, instead of doing a layer and I used less too (can't even taste it, just added moisture). I also folded in an extra 8 oz of shredded mexican blend cheese with the hamburger. (Extra cheese, in addition to the recommended layer) Crushed doritos as others recommended,on both the bottom and the top. I skipped the olives and served those alond with chunky salsa, shredded lettuce, and the remainder of the sour cream I had bought! Enjoy!!",

After making the recipe a couple of times, I found this amount fits best in that size dish. I also recommend reducing the amount of water used with the taco seasoning; it may be to \u201csoupy\u201d for this dish (the seasoning packet I use calls for \u00be cup water for each pound of ground beef, I use \u00bd cup per pound). If you are planning to have leftovers, I recommend that you not add the Tortilla chips the whole dish, as they tend to get soggy at re-warming.",

                "reviewBody": "I improvised pretty heavily with this recipe as I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand.  First off, I used the \"Morningstar Grillers\" ground meat-like product and mixed in a few spices (cumin, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt/pepper).  Since the grillers are a bit dry I was adding a little water here and there just to keep it from sticking.  I then found some leftover refried beans in the refrigerator and mixed those in with the \"meat\" while it was cooking.  This gave it a nice consistency.  I also did not have any tortilla chips, so I substituted black beans.  I minced two cloves of garlic, sauteed them in ~one tsp of safflower oil and then added a partially drained can of black beans to the skillet.  I cooked those until about half of the bean liquid had cooked off.  From bottom to top, I layered the meal: crescent roll(I used the reduced fat too), black bean mixture, \"meat\", cheese.  I baked for  25-30 minutes.  I was very pleased with how it turned out.  Some improvements to my adjustments would include (which is why I gave it 4 *'s): sour cream,  diced tomatoes (to top or added into the bean or meat mixture), avacado...ie something cool.  I'm sure this method takes down the calorie count pretty  significantly...but the taste is certainly there.  If you like beans (which I do), you will like this modification.",
