The main difference was that we use stew beef and instead of 10 hours in a crock pot (I love them too!) we used  a pressure cooker at 15lbs for 30 minutes.  The beef was really really tender and soooo good.   \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a rule though, since i inherited this recipe.  You have to drink a big ole' ugly glassfull of wine before you start.  then you have to have another while you cook and spill a little in the mix.\r\n\r\nI love this over egg noodles.\r\n\r\nNote: to avoid the flour lumps that one reviewer was complaining about, you have to mix water and flour and then pour that into the goulash.\r\n\r\n",

The recipe was kind of a family secret that no one in the family was able to get from her prior to her passing.  I came across this recipe and figured that I would give it a shot!  \r\n\r\nMy very first time making it, he took the first bite and his eyes filled with tears at the fact that it was so close to what his late aunt used to make for him as a child!!  I have never in my life seen a full grown man become so emotional over food!!\r\n\r\nAwesome recipe, highly recommend!!",
