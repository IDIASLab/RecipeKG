Eventhough the flavor of the first batch tasted great, it was a bit too spicy for my palate.  Therefore, the second batch I only used one habenero and one annaheim pepper.  I found that when I reduced the peppers, the chili is just a bit too sweet. I will 1/2 the brown sugar the recipe calls for the next time I make it with less peppers.  Also, the first time, I didn't have a dark beer on hand and used a domestic beer.  The second time, I used New Castle and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!  As others have suggested, I used 2 tablespoons of wasabi instead of the 1 that it calls for which really pumps up the deliciousness of the recipe!  I served this last batch with some friends, topped with cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and slices of warm french bread. Fifteen minutes later, there wasn't a drop left!",

It does take a little time to prepare for the first time, but it was well worth it.",

When making this recipe, I was a little concerned about how much chili powder was in the recipe, but it turned out to be just the right amount when blended with all the other spices and chili peppers. My health-conscious boyfriend did the shopping for this recipe and he substituted the spicy italian sausages with spicy turkey sausages and ground beef with ground turkey making this recipe delicious AND extra healthy. I used guiness for the dark beer, which my roommate was not too thrilled about since I stole one of his bottles, but he raved about the chili afterwards.  Thanks Aaron for sharing the recipe.",

I made it on a propane camp stove, and since I couldn't get to the store, I substituted for some of the ingredients with what we had on hand (canned roasted California chiles instead of fresh chiles, sweet Italian sausage instead of spicy, chicken instead of beef, a smaller amount of cayenne instead of chili powder). Instead of prepared wasabi, which is expensive and not something I keep on hand, I mixed a tablespoon of prepared horseradish with a pinch of two of turmeric (virtually the same thing, taste-tested and approved by my Japanese daughter-in-law). Now the only question is: If I make it again, will the power stay on?",
