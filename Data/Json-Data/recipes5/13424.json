I just covered the pan with foil, and baked for one hour.  I removed the foil after the hour and completed the baking for an additional 30 minutes.  I was concerned with all of the tomato sauce and adusted slightly.   I added 2 (15 oz) cans of tomato sauce and 1 (6 oz) can of tomato paste with the garlic/oregano flavoring.  It turned out perfectly.   Cut very easily and my hubby loved it.  Don't forget to place foil in the bottom of your oven!  Saves  big mess.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will definitely make again.",
