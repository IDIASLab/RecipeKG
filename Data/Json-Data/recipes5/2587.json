Here's how to proceed: Before cooking the vegetables, sear the chicken breast in a bit of olive oil. Once about 5 minutes per side. Your chicken is ready to turn when it releases easily from the pan. Do not turn it before this. Then, add the water and the chicken broth and finish cooking the chicken by boiling it about 10-15 minutes or until done. Scrape any chicken bits from the bottom as you add the broth. This now more chicken flavor rich broth can be poured in a heat proof glass to use as directed. There you have it! Now, start the recipe and proceed as directed. You may want to add a splash of white wine after you add the mushrooms and replace the parsley for dried thyme to add that warm comfort food smell and flavor. I didn't have the apple cider vinegar at hand and this soup was tasting FANTASTIC, will make it again hands down!",
