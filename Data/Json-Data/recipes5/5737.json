I was watching a show about snacks for the big game, and I suddenly HAD to have hummus, and I had no garbanzo beans, so I wound up using black beans. I added only about half the oil, and I didn't have to add much bean liquid at all to get a good consistency. I added a little turmeric (just cause it's good for you), a little more cumin and garlic, and about 1-2 T chopped cilantro to go with the more Latin flavor. It's resting in the fridge now, but it was very tasty immediately after I made it. It doesn't look the most appealing, so I think if I were to serve it for guests, I'd garnish it with minced tomatoes and cilantro for color. I plan to use this as a dip, but I think this would also make a great vegetarian filling for quesadillas.",

Had to use a little water and used about 1/4 cup EVOO which was fine by us as we love it. We also added a lot more garlic as that is our preference. We held back a few whole beans to put on top and drizzled on a bit more olive oil after putting in a container. Tastes great but putting in the fridge overnight to meld the flavors. We will definitely be making this again maybe we'll try cooking the dry beans and make a double portion. Just wondering can this be frozen?",
