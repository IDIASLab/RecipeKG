I used ground turkey instead of beef and no one could tell the difference. For a little kick once the cheese had melted all the way I added some hotsauce to the pot. My cheese took a little longer than an hour to melt so I would recommend starting ahead of time. Don't let it go too long in the pot! We had this for new years and after the toasts at midnight the dip had gone brown and had a bit of a burned taste (even on the low setting).",
