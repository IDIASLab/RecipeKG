I quadrupled this partly because we had company and the other part is we all love pasta! This was so very easy to make and using the bacon really made it stand out. I never would have thought about putting bacon in this sauce but it really adds a richness that I have never had in a vodka sauce. I made a dandelion green salad and had some garlic bread. It was so tasty and everyone was eating and so quiet that you could here a penne drop, lol!! Thanks again, Chef John :)",

I know, no longer authentic but it really turned out well! I was pleasantly surprised how little time it took to reduce the vodka, and how rich it tasted before adding the sauce.
