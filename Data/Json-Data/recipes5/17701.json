They bake up beautifully and taste so nice.  Very pretty too.  With the creamcheese frosting, they are ever so wonderful.  **3/4 cup shredded carrot=2 smaller size carrots.

I am vegan so I replaced half the butter with Earth Balance (vegan butter made with healthy oils) & the other half with unsweetened applesauce to cut the fat. Used 4 Tbsp. ground flaxseed mixed with the liquid from the crushed pineapple to stand in for eggs. This added fiber & heart-healthy fats as well!:) I also made just a couple changes to suit my tastes & to make them slightly healthier. Used 3/4 c. evaporated cane juice 1 Tbsp. molasses instead of brown sugar. Threw in some nutmeg ginger allspice & cloves to add more spice. Topped with a lemon vegan cream cheese frosting & this complemented the cookie flavor very well! Perfectly chewy & cakey and a really convenient way to eat carrot cake. I can't wait to share these!",

The second time I made these I knew I wanted to make sandwich cookies and I was making them for adults. I doubled carrots and used 4 tablespoons of a mixture of cinnamon Ginger nutmeg and allspice. They don't spread much especially of you double the carrots so I flattened them out quite a bit so they would make a nicer sandwich. I also sprinkled them with raw sugar to give the tops a nicer appearance. Used a cream cheese frosting that wasn't too sweet for the filling. They were a huge hit especially with the men.
