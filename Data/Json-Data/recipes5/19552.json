A bit too sweet for my tastes and I halved the sugar but the recipe title warns you so if you don't like sweet and don't cut down or eliminate the sugar it's on you! It doesn't make me hate it and it does lend to the salsa itself so I'll try quartering it next time. I used dehydrated onions since I didn't have any onions in the house at the time. I doubled the recipe and still only ended up with 1 full pint jar and about 3/4 of a pint jar. I decided to can this and although it was a lot of boiling for 1 3/4 jars I'm glad I did so we can have some of this salsa another time. I did a water bath for 15 minutes and the jars sealed perfectly. In my opinion the work for this recipe (peeling the tomatoes by boiling in water--the skins come right off!) then chopping all the tomatoes and boiling everything for hours is worth it. Next time I'm just going to make a heck of a lot more of this!:o) Thanks for the recipe!",

I read the comments before hand and knew I didn't want any sugar in mine so I omitted it completely. Instead of chiles I used canned jalapenos which made it very warm but not unbearable. I put in exact amounts of the seasonings but then added more garlic and herbs until the taste was perfect for me. My husband and coworkers LOVED it! I made it for the 2nd time yesterday and used 4 small fresh jalapeno peppers 1 green pepper and 2 banana peppers instead of the chiles. It tastes wonderful! Not as hot as the first batch but so tastey. Thank you for the recipe!",
