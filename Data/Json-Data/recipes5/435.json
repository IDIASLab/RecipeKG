After chopping the veggies, it only took an hour from start to finish and still had a nice stewed taste. I added a pound of leftover pulled pork for a protein boost and it blends in perfectly (I did leave out the salt since pork is so salty). I love a strong cumin flavor in my chili, so I changed the spice amounts to 1 Tbsp cumin and 2 Tbsp chili powder. I included the jalape\u00f1o and brown rice as well. I put the black pepper in at the beginning with the other spices and added ~3/4 of the can of corn at the end so it would be more balanced. I will definitely make this again and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing from how I made it this time! I think if you were to make it without meat, a second can of beans wouldn\u2019t go amiss!",
