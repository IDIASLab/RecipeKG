I basically had to start over and this is how i made it: sautee 4-6 cloves of garlic fresh ginger sliced green onions and 1-2 sliced jalapeno peppers in sesame oil. then add 1/2 c. soy sauce 1 c. pinapple juice and about 1/2 c brown sugar. add black pepper red pepper flakes white pepper sracha sauce and a little honey. at that pnt you can re-evaluate the soy sauce and add more if need be. i tossed my wings in this on the stove and allowed them to cook as the sauce caramelized on top of them. then took them out of the sauce and broiled them for 25 min tossed them in the sauce on the stove again and let them cook on the stove for another 5 min and then re-broiled for 10 minutes before serving. my wings were pre-cooked so you may need to broil for longer to cook through but they cme out amazing",
