I guestimated the amt. at 1/4 cup which may have been just a tad too much. The recipe didn't state what size dill pickle to use (whole half spear) so I used two spears which seemed fine. This recipe makes A LOT so unless you have a really large family or plan to eat a lot of sauce I would definitely recommend cutting the recipe in half. This will last us for months if the mayo keeps that long!",

One thing you should know this recipe makes a very large helping so if you're only making 10 to 15 fish sticks you're going to have A LOT leftover! I didn't have any olives at the time when I made this and the sauce still tasted great. One thing that has me excited about this recipe is it doesn't have that weird aftertaste that store bought jar tartar sauce has.",
