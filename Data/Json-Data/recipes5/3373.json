The next two times I prepared it in the morning and let it marinade all day. Soooo moist and tender. It was good both ways but the longer you can marinade your chicken the better. I did scale the recipe back a bit since it makes quite alot.This is my new standard way of doing chicken on the grill. Thanks so much for sharing!!",

I also baked mine in the oven on 375 for 40 minutes instead of dragging out the grill:o)  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.",

A nice change from barbeque sauce. The recipe does make a large amount, but I now keep it in a bottle in the fridge to have on hand for whenever I want to marinate something.  I was a bit skeptical, but after trying it, I'm sold.  My husband loves it (as do I).  Thanks Jill, for this fabulous recipe. I wish I could give it more stars!",

I also opted to use the zest of one lemon instead of the lemon juice.  I never use the salt and find that the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce provide enough for our taste.  This time, I used chicken thighs and let them marinate over night before putting them on the grill.  I set the grill up for indirect grilling, browned the skin over the coals and then moved them over to the cooler side to finish cooking.  The flavor of the marinade was down to the bone! I've used this for awhile and have since cut the oil in the recipe down to 1/2 cup and added other items in my own custom version.",
