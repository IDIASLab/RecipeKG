I can't imagine leaving the peels on a russet would result in a favorable color once blended. I ended up adding another bouillon cube because it needed it. I only blended one blender full and left the rest as is because I wanted some texture. This soup is very celery forward. With all of that being said, if you were to blend the entire batch as directed, this would make an excellent homemade replacement for the cream of celery soup you get in a can. No dairy, fresh, and you know exactly what went in it.",
