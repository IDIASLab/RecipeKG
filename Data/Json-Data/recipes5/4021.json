I used fresh oregano and added a teaspoon of Dijon mustard. (Garlic not necessary and I think this is better without) I drizzled this over cod filets before oven roasting them then used it as a finishing sauce for both the cod and some good quality fettucine. Sliced red-ripe tomatoes completed this excellent meal. This recipe this sauce is one to remember and refer to.",
