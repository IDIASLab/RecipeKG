I would suggest cooking the sausage & bacon in a separate pan, then getting a new pot to cook your onions & garlic in and continuing with the recipe from there. I get that using all the same pot adds to the flavor but it coated everything in a layer of orangey-brown grease and the soup just smelled like grease to me. Next time around I used a fresh pot for the stock and just added in the cooked meat and it was much better. The red pepper flakes can be a bit overbearing together with the mild sausage so next time I'd probably cut it down a bit on those. All in all it was delicious, thank you! Would make again.",

I didn't have heavy whipping cream is I boiled milk and added a little flour to thicken it up and then added it to the soup. AMAZINGNESS!!! Will be making this one all winter!",

He thought it got spicier the longer it sat in the fridge but I thought the spice weakened. Definitely take the time to drain the sausage otherwise you'll end up with an icky layer of grease on top that will coagulate in the fridge. The end result? Undoubtedly similar yet BETTER than Olive Garden's version. Definitely used the kale in place of the spinach and it stayed pretty firm. Bonus for the kale bake up the remainder to make kale chips.
