To cut down on time they have a microwave bag that's done in 90 seconds if you prefer. I also use Hellman's light mayo and FRESH lemon juice. This is easy to throw together and chock full of vibrant colors and flavors - not to mention it's light. I hope you enjoy it!",

Would you believe that I served this warm tonight with leftover turkey (the kosher one from Trader Joe's) from last night? And tomorrow I'll have it for lunch cold from the fridge. I didn't add salt I didn't have yellow pepper and I used full-fat mayo (I know...). Otherwise I followed your directions. This is so easy and such a great side dish! I LOVE the versatility of recipes like this one! Thank you very much!",
