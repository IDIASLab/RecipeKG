                "reviewBody": "This was fabulous! Here are some tips to make the most out of this meal:\n1) I used 2 green and 2 yellow squash. I did this for flavor, nutrition and color. In my opinion, using only 2 will not be enough. \n2) I cooked the garlic and onions alone first for 5 min on medium-low to enhance the garlic flavor and the onions would be soft. \n3) I then added the zoodles and cooked for only 2 min. Squash has a high water content and cooking for 5 min.  will make them sweat and get mushy. I really just wanted to blend the flavor together because I knew they would be added back to pan later with the shrimp. \n4) Off to the side, i marinated the shrimp in the garlic, lemon, salt, crushed pepper and a little EVOO in advance while I prepped and cooked everything else (like 15-20 min). I think this makes a world of a difference rather than seasoning straight in the pan. \nHubby and I licked our plates clean! Also an alternative for those who don't have a spiralizer is to use a julienne peeler. It's more time consuming, yet it's something most of us have handy so you don't have to run to the store and buy another gadget.",

I reduced the red pepper in half and the black pepper as well, it can always be added to taste later. It still had a little too much heat.  I would suggest using a whole bag of fresh spinach as it wilts to practically nothing.  I also used cooked shrimp and reduced the cooking time accordingly.  I even used a yellow squash I had on hand. It was my first dish made with zucchini noodles and a big hit.  This could be a weekly dish, it was so good.  I am going to try it with cubed chicken breast and like others mentioned, some asparagus.  We are trying to cut some carbs,  having zucchini noodles is an easy way to go.",
