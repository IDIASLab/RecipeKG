To make it a little healthier (and lower in salt), I use ground turkey instead of ground beef, homemade taco seasoning mix, and homemade salsa.

The rolls fit in perfectly and went up on the edges a little which made a real nice crust. Used homemade taco seasoning and salsa. The salsa was rather watery so I simmered it in the ground beef for a while. (Probably had closer to 2 lbs ground beef- didn't measure.) If you like spicy, add some cayenne, I didn't cuz hubby doesn't like real spicy, but I think it would of been good. I pretty much made as is, but I'm sure it could be changed up for variety.",
