Didn't have onion salt so I added my own salt in the form of kosher salt and added Italian seasoning and fennel (my favorite part of sausage hands down) then fried up for breakfast. I didn't let it sit for 4 days since I determined I wanted sausage this morning so I'll try that next time but this was good and very easy. Thanks for the recipe!",
