Great combination of flavors - I was tempted to leave out the olives but I'm glad I added them - the kalamata's added a delicious, subtle taste.  To make it a little lighter, I used much less oil and whole wheat couscous.  You can also used reduced fat feta to cut out some more fat.  I also sauteed the chicken in a balsamic marinade to give it extra flavor. The second time I made this I used fig flavored white balsamic which was delish!\r\n\r\nUpdate - made again replacing sundried tomatoes and olives with dried cranberries and chickpeas. Also used a honey flavored rotisserie chicken.  It worked great for a sweeter option (can also use goat cheese instead of feta)",

Also I wanted to make enough to share with a neighbor who had been very helpful to me during some recent medical problems and now had some of her own. I made the recipe as written though I used extra virgin olive oil (2/3rds cup) 1 1/2 Tbs regular balsamic vinegar and added a bit more lime juice (didn't have lemon) after tasting. In my mind this is not a big change to the recipe. Used the fresh herbs rather than dried as listed. The dressing tasted a bit odd but other reviewers said to try it. I cut up two boneless skinless chicken breasts into fairly small slivers rather than chunks then pan fried a few minutes added some water covered and cooked through. Drained the juice (saved for my cats) then refrigerated the chicken. Julienned English cucumber with a small V-Slicer Plus mandoline (available from BB&B) chopped the kalamatas and chopped some oil-packed sundried tomatoes. Made 1 cup couscous in only 1 cup water with some butter and Herb-Ox dried chicken bouillon powder. Turned out fine. Mixed it all up and tasted. Needed some more salt and pepper. Then added about a cup of chopped oil-packed artichoke hearts and tasted again. Great! Served over chopped lettuce. My neighbor and her husband really enjoyed it wanted the recipe for herself and my husband wanted seconds.",

I will make this often but I will definitely cut way back on the olive oil and I'll use fresh tomatoes and cucumbers out of my garden instead of sun-dried tomatoes and English cucumbers. Probably going to use black olives next time just from an expense standpoint too. I'll also thoroughly cool the couscous before adding the cucumbers since the cucumbers became slightly less crispy because of the warmth. The flavor was unbelievably good and I'm trying to think of other uses for the dressing.",

Also this recipe makes WAY too much dressing. It had a good flavor (I used a 1/2 C evoo and a 1/2 C lemon juice 2 T. regular balsamic and the rosemary S&P) but I only used a few tablespoons to dress the salad. Maybe just put it out on the table so your guests can put as much or as little as they want on their salad. Addictive!!!",

I chopped all of the other ingredients the next morning and put the salad together. Took it to a picnic and received several compliments.
