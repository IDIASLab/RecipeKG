I did use some regular hot sauce in place of the non vinegar based b/c I couldn't find it but just used the regular to taste. Also I had some fresh cooked chicken breast so I used that in place of the canned. I happened to have the chicken flavored ramen on hand but I can't wait to try it w/ the beef flavored. Bd. Thanks for sharing this deliciously different recipe!:)",

                "reviewBody": "This was...intriguing. I had some leftover rotisserie chicken to use up so thought I would give this a try. I made only 1/3 of the recipe - 1 package of the beef ramen - and adjusted all the other ingredients. This still made a big bowl. If doing a party - I would still only do a third as part of a buffet of options. I chopped the chicken and used Cholula for the hot sauce which was what I had on hand. After the first few bites we added in a big handful of shredded cheddar cheese. That added a nice mellowing agent to counter the hot sauce without obliterating the heat. It was interesting and not a bad thing so on a table with other options it would be a good change of pace. At the same time if I were doing only one appetizer for a party this would not be my choice.",

People at my race day get together loved it even though the kids thought it was too spicy. I may have exaggerated the jalape\u00f1os. I used gluten free rice noodles with homemade seasonings. It s like a jazzed up chicken salad. In fact I put leftovers on bread and ate it like a sandwich. Pretty good stuff! Thank you for the recipe.",
