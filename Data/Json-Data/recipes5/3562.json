Before you fold in the crab meat, if the veggie/binding mixture is too loose, add a little more bread crumbs, if it is too dry (which may result in the cakes not sticking together), and a little more mayo. After all the cakes are made, I lightly pat more crumbs on all sides. Yes, I do fry them, but not in that much oil as stated here. I have never broiled them, but I'm sure they are just as good. I hope this helps, and enjoy!",

My boyfriend has been wanting to make homemade crab cakes for a while now so we decided to do so for a recent potluck holiday party here in New England. We followed the recipe as directed and only changed a few things mostly from what we liked in other crab cakes. We used real crab from the seafood section of our grocery store (16 oz.) instead of the 3 cans. We decided to use crushed Ritz crackers in the mix instead of bread crumbs (though we still coated them with breadcrumbs). Also we omitted the bell peppers and decided to chop up onion and celery and saute them in a little butter instead (we had wonderful crab cakes on the coast once like that so we had to add it in!). Lastly since it was finger food at a potluck we formed cakes about the width of half-dollars which turned out great. We ended up baking them (at 375) since they were difficult to turn over and that worked out fine. Rave reviews at the party!!!",

I like to use panko breadcrumbs rather than regular for the outside crumbs (I use regular breadcrumbs in the actual crabcake mix). When I make them bite size I also bake them to avoid being in the kitchen for longer than I have to. I spray the baking tin with oil olive and then individually spray each crab cake with a wee bit of olive oil and bake at 375 for about 12 minutes (or until they are slightly golden and heated through). Whatever way you make it though- the results are always the same- delicious!",

I bought the cans of crabmeat at Wal-Mart and paid only 1.50 for each making this recipe as affordable as it is delicious. I made a couple of small changes. I used Italian style breadcrumbs (all I had) and I omitted the red pepper and substituted with more green bell pepper. I served these with an mango relish that I improvised and it was a great combination. I chopped one mango added about 2 Tbsp. finely chopped green bell pepper 1/2 small can of chopped pineapple 1/2 green apple peeled and finely chopped juice of 1 lime 1 Tbsp. apple jelly 1/2 serrano pepper (finely chopped and no seeds) a small handful of chopped cilantro and a teaspon of sugar. Pureed a small portion of the mixture and then mixed that back in with the rest. The crabcakes had a wonderful flavor all on their own but with the addition of the salsa it was over-the-top amazing! Definitely worthy of serving to company or a/o you want to indulge. Thanks Lori for a great crabcake recipe. I will make this again and again.",

For the first two cakes I followed the recipe and fried them in a skillet as directed. They looked fantastic but there's no mistake that there's a lot of oil there. Thinking that frying them in less oil on a griddle might be more healthy and less oily I cooked the last four patties on a flat Westbend grill in about an ounce and half of Canola oil. I cooked them five minutes per side and they crisped up nicely and heated well through. My wife and I compared the flavor at dinner an both agreed that lighter was better. Also I omitted the hot sauce and onion powder from the cakes themselves. Instead I added them to a tartar sauce made with light mayo (Duke's) sweet relish (Vlasic) fresh lemon juice and a little Worcestershire. Over all fantastic.",

They did not stay together in the pan and I just had a huge piled on mush in the pan. I taste the mixture and it was so greasy. I don't know what happen. The recipe probably requires more egg whites to hold together in the pan. Very disappointed!",
