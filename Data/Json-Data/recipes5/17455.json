It was very convenient to simply pop it in the oven and the tops of the slices browned and crisped very nicely. However the lower half of every slice was a soggy mess. The butter and brown sugar layer at the bottom tasted great a nice alternative to serving with syrup but I would cut the amounts by half next time. Also I'd leave out at least one egg. I substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup for a richer flavor. I didn't care for this recipe that much but the four guys I live with all gave it rave reviews...go figure! So we'll probably try it again with a few modifications.",

To my hubby and children's delight I made an executive decision to have Christmas at home. Everyone asked me to make a huge breakfast and this recipe was part of my menu. I can't tell you how much this was loved! I used challah bread only soaked for about an hour and a half didn't use the corn syrup added lots of cinnamon and because I had it around for the holiday I replaced the milk with eggnog. Once done I turned the casserole upside down onto a dish. The caramalized sauce ran all down the sides and looked really pretty. Thanks Sarah for a great recipe that didn't even taste like french toast; more like a very yummy gooey pastry. Delicious!",

I actually use Texas Toast and layer the ingredients in my 9 x 13 glass Pyrex. 1/2 sugar mixture goes on the bottom, then a layer of bread, then 1/2 egg mixture. I put most of the remaining sugar mixture on top of that, and repeat with the bread and remaining egg mixture. I end up with a dollop of the sugar mixture on each piece of egg-soaked bread and refrigerate. I've never had a problem with hardening sugar on the bottom of the pan this way.
