I took it easy on the spice in the marinade but only because my husband is not crazy about really hot food.  But I added a few drops on the shwarma itself, mmmmmmm   I did BBQ it and it turned out good.  I added a mix of chopped onion, cucumber, yellow bell pepper, grape tomatoes, and baby spinach.  Seasoned it with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  This was a perfect summer meal that was easy to make!!",
