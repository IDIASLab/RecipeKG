Used black beans instead of kidney (just a personal preference). 2. Put taco seasoning tomato sauce and diced tomatos in the pot with rice in the beginning of the cooking process instead of the end (so rice would absorb flavor). 3. Because I added sauce and diced tomatos in at the beginning I decreased water by 1 cup (used 2 cups instead of 3). I still had to cook the rice with the lid off to cook off liquids so in the future I will probably try decreasing water even more. 4. Added a bit of cheese on top and a couple of tortilla chips on the side. Will make this recipe again.",

I used all of the recommendations by the last reviewer NADROJ451. I used instant brown rice which meant I was done with dinner in about 15 minutes! We've never had black beans before or a meal without meat for that matter so I was pleasantly surprised! This looks very appealing and is very filling. This moves to the front of my recipe book!",

I sauteed some onion garlic and 1/2 head of green cabbage in canola oil until soft added the rice and taco seasoning and sauteed then added the water and beans. After the rice was cooked I added some frozen peas and a can of tomatoes with jalapenos (I think an additional can of tomato sauce would have been too much tomato). It turned out great! Made a lot of food my hubby loved it and we used it as burrito filling! Very healthy cheap and satisfying-thanks!",
