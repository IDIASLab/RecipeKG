I wish I had followed what I know instead of the recipe. The noodles were dripping oil. Very unappetizing. The oil can be reduced by 1/2. A Tablespoon or less in the water and 1/4 to 1/3 cup over the noodles would be so much better.",

Thanks for the recipe!\n\nYou never need to put oil in pasta water - that is a myth and added calories.  The oil sits on top of the water, doing absolutely nothing regarding the noodles sticking together or not.  As long as you have a big pan of water, salted to taste like the sea, all you have to do is stir your pasta occasionally.  Pasta sticks b/c there isn't enough water in your pan and/or you don't stir it.  Stir it as soon as you put it in the water and then a few more times till it is done.",
