In other words, some were split. Perfectly useable in recipes and salads, etc. After cooked you can spice to your preference. Personally I would add a grind of pink Himalayan salt while cooking to bring out the flavor of the bean a little more so you don\u2019t have to salt them as much at the table. All in all fast alternative to canned beans!",
