Almost evryone said they had a hard time with the \"batter\", I thought I will fix the problem before I have it!  I follwed the recipe like it said but before frying the chicken, after dipping it in the batter, I dipped it in a basic flour mixture to coat over the batter!! this worked out very well! It browned nicely... and didn't stick at all!!! Mind you it has to be a good medium-hot lard you are frying it in!!and youare only browning the outside of the chicken not cooking it!! It cooks in the slow cooker!",

In retrospect I see no reason to use the soup at all since a basic dredge of flour salt and pepper will create a better fry-crust and won't stick to the pan. To add insult to injury as I was scooping up the frozen concentrate for the sauce I saw a recipe for the exact same orange glaze on the side of the can. Dang! So next time save money time and dishes. Just fry your chicken as usual scoop on the glaze in the same pan and have your dinner in 10 minutes instead of three hours.",

I tweeked out most of the fat by omitting the shortening and using the 98 (I think)% fat free creamed soup by Cambells. I also cooked it alittle differently. I mixed the seasonings together floured the chicken and threw it in a nonstick skillet with cooking spray to brown. For the sauce I used fat free chicken broth sugar twin brown sugar and 2/3 cup orange juice concentrate. Threw everything in the crockpot for about 4 and a half hours and YUMM! Will definately make it again and again and....",
