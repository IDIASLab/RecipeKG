I made it with red rice and omitted the prosciutto to make it vegetarian/kosher but it may have tasted better with it. I just didn't like the dressing all that much. I had to add some garlic. The idea was great but the dressing needs adjustments.",

I cooked the rice with the optional broth and butter as opposed to just water. I also had some lemon basil growing in my garden so I used that instead of regular. (I can definitely taste the lemony difference!) To the dressing I added about 2 tsp of minced garlic and a little of the liquid from the jar of minced garlic. It was fantastic! If you don't like garlic another option would be just add some of the marinade that comes in the artichoke jar to the dressing. I might try that next time! This recipe will definitely be a staple for me.",
