This one took a lot more steps than the other one but oh boy was it worth it! I made half of this recipe as written with a couple of minor exceptions--had no lemon pepper so just used a little zest and more pepper no granulated onion so used fresh chicken stock was from carcass of Roast Sticky Chicken no goat horn peppers so used red jalapenos. This was so very good! And it gave me a chance to use the beforehand unknown Garlic Basil Spread. Yum! I'll be doing this one again for sure!",

Instead I make it as the recipe stated. But when I saw how much the spice mixture made I opted not to put it all on the roast. Also I didn't have any wine so I just put extra chicken stock in the bottom of the pan. I don't think it needed that much liquid either. It didn't seem to serve any purpose. After shredding the pork I put it in the liquid which was very peppery and salty. Then I took the pork out and put it in the onion/pesto mixture without the Marsala wine. The sandwiches tasted really good but were still quite salty.",
