I'm not going to lie...it is incredible! It is so flavorful and tender. I cook for two men...my husband and my brother in law, both firefighers, and both good cooks themselves.  They just loved this and can't wait to cook it at work.  I served it with sushi rice and plain sauted zuchini...which complimented the recipe perfectly. The only thing I altered...I filled the chicken cavity with onion and doubled the liquid.  So good!",

I modified the recipe for a 5 lb chicken (changed serving size to 10) and then added 1 tbsp pepper and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.) I skinned the chicken and put all the modified ingredients in the crock pot itself, and then mixed them right there in the pot, then I put the chicken in and turned it over a couple times to get the mixture all over it and cooked it breast side down. It was wonderful! My son even asked for seconds and usually doesn't like eating chicken. Served it with rice cooked with the rest of the chicken broth (1 cup left from can) and some herbs de province in the rice cooker. Will definately be made again",

I substituted lime juice for the lemon (didn't have lemon), increased the garlic, added onion powder & pepper and decreased the olive oil, as suggested. Instead of removing the skin completely, I loosed it all around the breast and back and marinated the chicken inside the crock for about an hour before I turned it on. I also turned the chicken a few times while cooking. It came out super tender and flavorful. I made cocnut rice and green beans to go with. Yummy!",

It was delicious. To go along with it I made some white rice and instead of using water I used some of the slow cooker juice some chicken broth and a little water to cook the rice. Then I stir fried the rice after it was done with fresh mushrooms and topped with some green onions. (I added some butter and more slow cooker juice in with the stir fry) Then I put the chicken on top. He loved it and he can be a critical SOB (lol).",

I omitted the sesame oil as I am not a big fan & put in about a teaspoon of fresh ginger. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!",

It was tender and tasty and as one person said even better the next day; however the presentation was blah. Fall-off-the-bone tender means I served a pile of chicken chunks. That is fine for the 2nd day but on the first day I like to present a whole chicken. In Steeped Chicken they keep the skin on and simmer the chicken (breast side up with sauce barely shimmering NOT boiling) for 15 minutes. Then you turn off the heat put the chicken breast side down cover the pot and let the chicken finish cooking while it steeps in the sauce. After an hour it will be done. I often move the pot to the fridge and let it steep overnight to serve later. Before serving I put it in a HOT 550 degree oven for about 7 minutes to crisp the skin. It comes out with crispy skin and tender flavorful juicy meat.",
