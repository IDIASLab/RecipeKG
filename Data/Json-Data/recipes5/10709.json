I expect that with practice I could do it faster and I'm sure some of it could be done in advance to make it easier. I don't remember having cooked a Cornish Hen before so once served I had some difficulty cutting it and getting the dressing out in the elegant fashion I was hoping for. Basically I made a sloppy mess. I did follow the recipe exactly and the bird was juicy. The sauce was just sweet enough and I loved the look and taste of the cranberries.

I served the Cornish Hens and Cranberry Stuffing with Maple Sauce along with mashed potatoes and tangy French-cut green beans. Umm Umm Good! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was very time consuming to make as the recipe reads. For that reason I used Pepperridge Farms Herb Stuffed Bread Cubes which cut down at least one hour of prep time. And I also used Simple Truth Dried Cranberries and chopped walnuts. During the first 45 mins. of baking I covered the Cornish Hens with foil and threw in some mini-carrots and onion cubes around them to make them nice and moist. Then the last 15 mins. I removed the foil and basted them with the Maple Syrup Sauce made from the pan drippings until they were brown.",

I found actual cranberry sauce to be more complimentary. Just felt the hens needed a bit more pizzaz. I liked the fresh herbs but buying them is an added expense.",
