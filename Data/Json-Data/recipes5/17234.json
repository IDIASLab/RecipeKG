The only thing I would have done differently (and should have followed the others' advice) is cut the butter in half because it was WAY too much and made the centre liquidy. All around great flavour though.",

Total prep time was less than 10 minutes!  In baking, the dough spread out and covered the pineapple beautifully with a crisp on the outside, chewy type dough that was delicious! I served it with vanilla ice cream and hubby took leftovers to work, ate it cold, no ice cream and told me he'd be happy if I made this one again!  The tartness from the pineapple and the  sweetness of the dough was a great combination.",
