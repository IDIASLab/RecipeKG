What a winner! I didn t have lemon but that didn t stop me from making this I m one of those rare individuals who doesn t like lemon with my fish anyway. I didn t have Italian blend cheese (don t use it) but the shredded blend I had on hand worked just fine. I also used half the amount of Worcestershire called for which I did because it seemed like overkill to me. Good call at least for my tastes. I served this over Maque Choux and it was awesome good. Just wish I hadn t let the frying time get away from me it goes from just right to overbrowned in the blink of an eye!",

For the cheese, I mixed some shredded mozzarella with grated good parmesan.  I also made them with salmon. Keeper recipe!! To keep from falling apart, I pressed batter into a 1/4 cup measure and gently tapped the cakes out into pan & didn't move or flip them until browned on one side. At this size you'll get more than 6.",
