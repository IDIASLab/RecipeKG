The kumquat (calamansi) was from my own tree.  The fruit are about 1 - 1 1/4\" in size and about 5 of them made the 2/3 cup needed for the puree. \nI will definitely make this again as I can make a lot using my own calamansi versus some other recipes that required me to use 3x as many of the fruit from my tree which is harder as the fruit is seasonal for me.",

I saw this kumquat pie recipe and tried it. The only thing I did differently is use a regular pie crust instead of graham cracker crust. If you like creamsicle ice cream you will love this pie. It's rich and creamy and oohh so good. Really easy to make.",
