I used imitation crabmeat and definitely wasn't a pound, so that is probably why it was so spicy.  I ended up doubling the sour cream and mayo to tone down the flavor.  Next time I will halve the cayenne pepper, and go from there.  What a great taste, though.  Can't wait to serve to our friends.  Thanks, HEP303!",

My only suggestion is for those that don't like a dry mixture. As written this recipe comes out rather dry. Those that like more moisture in the mix should add more of the wet ingredients. I've had many crab salads through the years and this is one of the most tasty and interesting.",

I made it a day before I needed the salad so that the flavors would all have a change to blend together. I had to add an additional tablesppon each of the sour cream and mayonnaise because the salad wasn't moist enough for my liking. Instead of the one pound of shredded crab I used two pouches of imitation crab meat 7 ounces in each pouch. I minced the meat in my food processor so that I could easily transfer a small amount of the salad into individual phyllo mini-tart shells using the bigger scoop of my melon baller. I placed these little tarts on white paper doilies on top of a cobalt blue tray and it was a lovely plate for the table. I'm figuring it was a success because there was not one single piece leftover to bring back home!",
