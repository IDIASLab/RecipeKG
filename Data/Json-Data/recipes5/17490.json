Also, near the end of her recipe it says to bake for 8-10 minutes but it should be 14 minutes.  I had fallen in love with these cookies when I first tried them years ago but didn't get the recipe at that time.  When I found it here I tried it and they were extremely bland..not at all like I remembered them.  After researching several other recipe sites I consistantly found the changes I've mentioned and my cookies are much improved.  Hope this helps.",

I don't know how it would taste without the frosting but I doubt most would care for it if one was looking for something in the cookie line. Two children in my family wouldn't eat them but the adults loved them. I used pineapple/apricot preserves and that worked fine but I will double the amount next time. This recipe is also great because there are no eggs and not a lot of sugar and I used low-fat cream cheese so it would be a little more healthy.",
