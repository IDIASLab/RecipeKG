Well the jam seemed to sink and all but two of the muffins lost their bottoms in the pan and as I seem to be the only reviewer who had this happen I'm guessing I was probably the only one who didn't use liners. The recipe also directs to make a depression in the batter to drop the jam in to. I'm also guessing this contributed to the problem. I baked them at 400 degrees and they were a little over done at 20 minutes so I can't imagine how overdone they would be if baked at 425. 350 to 375 for 20 minutes would be acceptable for these. Problems aside these weren't outstanding enough in any aspect for me to attempt again.",

I used a homemade strawberry freezer jam in these muffins. I did bake the muffins at 350 for 20 minutes based on other reviews I'd read. For me these were a mess. I had the same issue that another reviewer had--the jam bubbled through the muffin batter and made a mess all over my muffin tin and in the oven. I don't know what I did wrong but I'm not patient enough to try these again. Not only were these pretty much unedible I had quite the mess to clean up after.",

Oh and as for the concerns over jam bubbling to the top: mine was right at the top (barely covered with batter) and still didn't bubble over.
