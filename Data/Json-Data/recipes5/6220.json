I added just a few things we really liked this!\" I had cream of mushroom soup not chicken so used that instead and halved the entire recipe for 3 of us. The cornflakes on top were just a little too sweet both in aroma and taste so when I make this again I will consider crushed up Ritz crackers or Ruffles chips; not sure. I also added in some lightly-sauteed onions and garlic. Really liked that it didn't have the typical rice in it that one sees in chicken casseroles like these; the cornflake topping was enough starch for us but like I said that's the 1st thing I'll swap out next time I make this.",
