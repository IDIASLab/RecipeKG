                "reviewBody": "This is a great recipe that I grew up eating and still make it often, just last week, as a matter of fact! I prefer to use Spaghetti Rigati or Thin Spaghetti. I usually just eyeball the recipe, but Chef John's measurements are spot on. I do add some freshly ground black pepper and sometimes I change it up by adding caramelized onion. Last week, I added the onion and also bacon that I chopped finely and crisped and sauteed the onion, garlic and stems using a bit of the bacon grease along with the oil and butter. That was a tasty variation. Another variation that I have made, one that might not appeal to everyone, is to cook the florets until they are very soft and mashing the broccoli/garlic and onions into the stock, leaving some of the broccoli in small chunks. This method makes it more of a sauce that will cling to the pasta. Alternately, you can also set aside some florets to cook tender crisp so that you have the best of both worlds! For Chrissy, yes, you can use frozen broccoli, but the cooking time will have to be adjusted. I would let the broccoli thaw first and then proceed with the recipe. Hope this helps!",
