Could only find 6 oz can of crabmeat so I used 2 6oz cans. Added some old bay. Baked them in the oven for 15 mins....they were a little hard so next time I'll probably heat up the crab mixture in the oven first & then put it on top of the pretzels with the cheese & only do 5 mins in the oven.....other then that....fantastic!!!",

I may even try making homemade pretzels (I used frozen soft pretzels...) Thanks for the inspiration and for making my son smile!!",
