Second the flavor is a bit balnd and needs a bit of spicing up. To fix the first problem I simply divided in half. Instead of three eggs I used one whole egg and one egg yolk. To fix the second problem I kept the original 2 Tbls of brown sugar for the divided recipe and added vanilla extract and a little bit of cinnamon. Overall the texture of the pancakes are soft and fluffy. Even though they are made with oatmeal you would not know that unless told. My whole gang likes them including the picky 8 year old. One word of caution though these pancakes do not bubble the same way as normal pancakes so make sure you turn them when the edges are slightly drying to make sure you don't burn them.",

I would have used soy, but I don't really have any other uses for it, so decided to go w/the buttermilk I already had instead.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, and next time, will probably just use that and cut out the white flour altogether.  I used old-fashioned oats because I don't keep quick oats on hand.  They were great!  I also added a little bit more blueberries.  They were light and fluffy with a great texture inside and out!",
