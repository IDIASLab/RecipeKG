A few changes were made, most notably the sour cream sauce as the Old El Paso Zesty Sour Cream seasoning seems to have been discontinued. \n\n1. First, I cut back on the red pepper. I used probably half to 3/4 of a red pepper. Two whole peppers just seemed like too much for a pound of turkey.\n2. I used Rotel Chipotle flavored tomatoes and green chilies, instead of regular Rotel. This added a lot of distinct flavor. If you don't like spice or a smoky flavor maybe stick with regular Rotel. But I thought this was a great use in the recipe.\n3. I used a simple Mexican blend of cheese as it was what I had on hand.\n4. Since the sour cream seasoning seems to be discontinued I located it's ingredients and added the following to taste:\n Sugar, Salt, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Dried Chipotle Pepper, Smoked Paprika, and Hot Sauce.\n\nI started with about a tsp of everything and added more to taste. I thought this turned out very well. I then served with a homemade Spanish rice recipe from this site. Will definitely make again!",

They all asked me to make these again soon, so they will probably be on the menu next week, too.
