The only thing I did differently (or added) was I lightly oiled the fish before seasoning. I seasoned the fish coarse sea salt and pepper red pepper flakes onion powder and some Italian seasoning. then rubbed the dill and lemon mixture over it. I let it sit for about 10 minutes and completed the rest of the recipe as directed. I added a little garlic powder to the mayo/mustard/dill mixture covered the fish topped with Panko sprayed some Butter flavored Pam on it then broiled til golden brown. Served with jasmine rice and sauteed kale.",

Somehow, our fish turned out too strongly flavored. I ended up with way (WAY) too much of the sauce coating, combined with a really strong tang from marinating the fish in the lemon dill juice.  If I made it again, I would just lightly coat each fillet with the sauce. And probably use a different fish. LOL",
