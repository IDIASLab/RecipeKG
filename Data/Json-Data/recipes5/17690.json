I played around with it then decided enough was enough and my exercise was over for the day. I froze the rest for pie crust or another cookie exercise day. This bakes up very nice in the oven and you can end up with crunchy cookies if you bake longer or have a thinner dough (yeah mine wasn't so thin) or soft if you have thick dough and cook a bit less. They are full of ginger flavor so if you like that odds are you'll like this cookie. Thanks for the recipe!",
