I followed most of the ingredients, but I added Dried onion soup mixes {2}, water to come half up to the meat,and Worstershire sauce. I cooked on high 4 hours and low for as long as everyone got home!!! {3 to 5 hrs} After eating some sliced meat with our dinner, I put the pot in the fridge. The next morning I skimmed all the fat off the top. Later, I also added stew vegies to the liquid {along w/ chopped meat that was left} in order to use everything!!! My whole family loved it!!",

Then I was outside - when I came in the house 4 1/2 hours later (total cooking time 5 1/2 hours) you could smell it had burned. What a dissapointment. (the creamcheese/horseradish sauce is great!)",
