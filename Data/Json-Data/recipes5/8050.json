Texture is a bit soft and different than any quiche I\u2019ve ever had.  After 15 minutes of pre-baking the pie shell, the edges already were pretty browned, so I did cover them before adding the filling and then back to the oven.  For my taste, I would have preferred either swiss or gruyere instead of cheddar, but that\u2019s simply a matter of personal preference.  To give it a bit more eye appeal, I garnished with some sliced green onion and reserved bacon.  This was pretty good, although I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll make it again.  Karen, thanks for sharing your recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "I thought this was delicious!  I was nervous about other reviewers saying that it was too sour creamy tasting and it did seem odd that I'd only use 2 eggs.  But I have to say - it was creamy, fluffy and delicious - I loved the texture of it.  The only thing I think I did differently was used a frozen 9 inch pie crust from the store.  I also cooked mine for 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  It did puff up nicely during that last ten minutes.  The flavor was amazing. I actually LOVE sour cream and so I couldn't even taste it.  My daughter, who likes sour cream okay, said she could taste it but she really loved the quiche.  I would say this - if you hate sour cream, this might not be your recipe. If you like or love it, definitely give it a try! The only other feedback I'd have is that I'd maybe start with the onions as step 1 and as they cook, go into pre-baking the crust and bacon. Since the onions take a long time and only get better as they cook, I'd start there.  For me personally, I also prefer the use of baking my bacon in the oven over the skillet.  The only time skillet-frying bacon is a good idea for me is when I need to use the bacon grease later in the recipe.  In this case, I should have cooked the bacon in the oven - it's the best way imo.  Put bacon on a parchment lined baking sheet; into a COLD (un-preheated) oven at 400 degrees and cook for 25 minutes.  Perfectly crisp bacon every time, no fuss.",

Just followed the recipe to a T (except for the pre-baking), baked at 350 for more than the time called for, probably for 45-50 minutes, keeping an eye on its progress through the glass window of the oven.   Watched it puff up and deflate and waited to see it start to brown on top.  Tested it for doneness and when it looked like a very pretty quiche, took it out of the oven.  It was a very long ten minute cooling time, because it looked so good and smelled even better, so we maybe only waited 8 or 9 minutes before we cut and served.  DELICIOUS.  All agreed.  It has all the best ingredients a quiche could have, and it will be my go-to selection from now on.  I think it was those wonderful caramelized onions.   Or maybe the sour cream/cream cheese combo.  Or the bacon.  Or maybe the sharp cheese.  Anyway, there wasn't a crumb left.  So now I must make another, because it just tasted like more!",
