I made the first batch exactly as the recipe said and after one bite did not eat them. A couple of weeks later I thought I must have made an error somewhere so darn if I didn't make them again. This is a lot of preparation work folks! This time they were a little dry ( I overcooked them to get to the point where an inserted toothpick came out clean) but the real problem was the clove flavor- way too strong. I would leave this out. Second thing- the pumpkin seeds are tough as nails! Why put these on there? Anyway my very non-picky family didn't finish even one muffin. My opinon I know some reviewers liked them.",
