I also added a little white wine, the garlic and a shallot to deglaze the pan b4 adding the water/spice mixture. Even then, I had to add about a cup more water while it was cooking. I also dredged the chik breasts in a lemon pepper seasoning in addition to the oregono. I omitted all the salt from the recipe too, since boulion is so salty. Made the leftover broth into gravy, cooked up the Uncle Bens Chicken rice, and dinner was AbFab!! I will def be making this again!",

It doesn't make much extra sauce so if you want some to scoop over potatoes or pasta you should double the sauce.  The only thing I do differently is I use boneless skinless chicken tenders instead of chicken breast halves.  The chicken pieces are smaller which allows them to soak up more of the juices and seasonings making them very flavorful and tender.  I have also added sliced mushrooms... yum.",

I took a lot of advice from the posts here: I covered the bottom of the pot with potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and lots of garlic (about 6 cloves). I used bone-in breasts (I did brown them first, using butter, salt and lemon-pepper mix, awesome), then deglazed the pan with 1 cup white wine. Added all that to the pot, along with 2 cans of chicken stock, 6 tablespoons lemon juice, and a little more salt. I cooked on high for 2 hours, then low for 1 hour - perfect! I think the bone-in chicken made a big difference, it was wonderful and falling apart. I would be careful with the lemon juice - I love strong flavors and was tempted to add more, but my 6 tablespoons was bordering on too bitter - excellent though! Also turned the extra juice into gravy for veggies and it was yummy, with side of chicken couscous!",

I doubled the spices except the garlic and used the juice of an entire lemon, and used chicken stock instead of water/boullion, using enough stock to almost cover chicken.  And 30 min. before cook time finished, I stirred in 2 T. cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup water.  Plenty of sauce for serving with chicken over pasta.  And here's a trick:  it was REALLY lemony and too sour, so I stirred in almost 2 T sugar.  Totally fixed that problem.  It was DIVINE!!!  Thanks for an awesome, interesting recipe.",

I served w/Uncle Ben's whole grain brown rice w/garlic flavors & steamed broccoli & cauliflower & it was sensational! My fiance is NOT a big chicken eater & he ate every bite of his & complimented the flavor! Will definitely make again...I def. agree that making sure the breasts are covered in liquid is key..also, my chicken breast were kind of thick & so I think this helped it not to dry out! Sooo yummy!
