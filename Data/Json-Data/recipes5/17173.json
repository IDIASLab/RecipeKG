These cinnamon rolls were very quick and easy, the only changes I had to make were to add more flour (about a cup and a half or two cups) to keep it from being so sticky, and I added some cinnamon to the dough and about 1/4 cup sugar because I noticed the recipe didn't call for any.  Also sugar helps the yeast proof faster.  Since we love cinnamon, I put more into the brown sugar mix than the recipe called for. Also, I put them in the refrigerator overnight and they rose some, but not as much as I wanted so I let them rise in a warm place (the closet) for an hour before I baked them.  The baking time was only 14 minutes for mine, and the cinnamon rolls were so perfect and golden and ENORMOUS!  This recipe made 18 enormous cinnamon rolls.  Seeing as it's only my mom and I, I'm going to give some to neighbors and friends.  I topped them with homemade cream cheese frosting, but I don't think they needed it because they were already so moist and soft and wonderful. I don't think they were cakey or biscuity at all. As good as Cinnabon, just a lot cheaper!  And if you crowd the pan a bit, the middles of the cinnamon rolls will come up just like Cinnabons.  A couple tips:  Warm the buttermilk over the lowest heat setting or it will start to curdle.  Also, once you have your cinnamon roll log, stretch it out a bit if you need to to make it all the same thickness.  And to cut them, get a piece of thread and put it around as much roll as you want to cut off, then pull the",

Mini chocolate chips with toasted pecans and a butter/cinnamon/brown sugar mix was a huge hit at the inn I was pastry chef for; had people driving all the way from Maine to get them. Orange zest and walnuts with a raw sugar/butter filling is divine with a light orange zest infused sugar icing glaze at the end. Make them at night, refrigerate overnight and bake in the morning for something that tastes like you spent hours and hours on it. Oh, and a note. If you warm the buttermilk too much, it curdles, but doesn't wreck it. Just stir with a wisk and dump it into the mixer. No worries!",

                "reviewBody": "Holy frijoles.....this makes a BIG cinnamon roll. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to work with this recipe. I proofed the yeast with the warm water and an additional quarter cup of sugar (personal choice, as I wanted a sweeter dough) for ten minutes, then added the buttermilk and a half cup of melted butter in place of the vegetable oil while alternating with the dry ingredients. I did not need much more than a couple extra tablespoons of flour. When I made the filling, I upped the cinnamon to two and a half teaspoons of cinnamon and a teaspoon and a half of nutmeg. Again, that's personal preferance. I found this dough very easy to work with, one of the easiest I have worked with. Rose beautifully, was easy to roll out and roll back up and cut. Really just GREAT dough. Honestly. These even baked up really well. And I really liked that the melted butter was mixed with the brown sugar and spices. It really made making these rolls a snap for me. I don't know why I never thought of that before. The only problem I had was not using a deep enough pan. When the filling oozed out of the rolls, it bled all over my oven causing a small fire. Not fun. BUT, that is my fault, not reflective of the recipe. This was the best cinnamon roll recipe I've worked with made even better by personal changes of my own. I plan on frosting them with a homemade cream cheese cinnamon roll icing. Watch the baking time, though. These cook fast and can burn if you aren't watching carefully.",

Reheated beautifully day after Christmas.  I made four changes.  (1) BREAD flour instead of all purpose.  Better texture because it has more protein, which is worked into tiny strands while  you're kneading, and overnight.  Yum. (2) Added 1/2 cup of white sugar to dry ingredients.  (3) My new jar of \"Active Dry\" yeast had expired, grrr, arg, so I used \"Rapid Rise\" packets instead.  Just followed the slightly different directions as given on packets, and dough came out perfectly. (4) No buttermilk, so I put 2 tablespoons white vinegar in milk.  Three comments.  (1) Several reviewers mentioned dough is very soft.  True; you need to work it carefully, but that's the nature of the beast.  Adding too much flour will mess up your texture.  Instead, keep things cold and work surface and pin lightly dusted with flour.  A little perforated-top flour shaker is great.  Kneading & resting are important steps, so don't skip them.  I measured bread flour by dipping cup into bag and leveling with knife -- and found recipe amount was spot on. (2) When applying filling, use stiff pastry or paint brush.  Go all the way to the short edges of your rectangle of dough, but DON'T apply mixture to very edges of the long ends.  Leave 'em bald so log seals better when you roll it up.  (3) Clean knife between every few cuts on log.",

The best part is, you can make them the night before and just stick them in the oven and 30 minutes later you have nice hot homemade cinnamon buns. Don't be scared by the long list of ingredients, it goes together perfectly and quickly.",
