I never would have thought of cumin and a red wine reduction going together but in this circumstance it really works. The lamb was quite flavorful and my daughter (the other lamb lover in the family) enjoyed this dish as much if not more than I. I did feel the need to add a little kosher salt to the wine sauce because I felt it was just a touch too sweet. Otherwise no modifications. Thanks for submitting a unique and flavorful recipe.",

I'd recommend making about twice of the delicious sauce as we loved it so much we would have liked even more of it!",
