I used it to cook boneless, skinless chicken breasts in, on the stove.\nMedium heat, covered pan, and turned meat after 5 minutes, re-covered and cooked additional 5 minutes.  It was good.  Husband liked it and told me he'd eat it again, so that works for me.  Next time I plan to halve the butter, use other ingredients as listed and spoon a little over the chicken instead of cooking in the sauce.  Thinking it might be a fresher flavor that way.  In any case we liked the flavor, so thanks for the submission.",
