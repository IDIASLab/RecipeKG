                "reviewBody": "The chicken comes out super in this sauce. Make sure to drain the chicken after browning for a few minutes on each side as the remaining juices from the chicken are released during baking and the sauce doubles. I noticed that if I hadn't done that then the sauce would have been too watery. I followed the recipe exactly and mine came out perfect not too sweet not to vinegary not too sour. If you have concerns around the sauce being too \"vinegar-y\" keep it at a low-med heat in the sauce pan in the meantime while you are browning the chicken. This will burn off and thin out some of the vinegar's tangy taste but still leave an undretone of it which is required for this recipe. After I tasted this I realized it would be a great sauce for pulled pork or really any meat in a slow cooker. For pulled pork I would probably double or triple the brown sugar though to complement it more than the chicken requires. As far as the taste of this sauce it reminded me of the sauce used in Lloyds Barbeque Ribs that you buy ready made at the store. I love that particular sauce and I have finally found a recipe that I can use and save the money from buying Lloyd's ribs just for tasting that great sauce. This is a great addition to my recipe collection will make it one of my regulars. Thanks!! A",

I fixed it for my wife and myself and we liked it much better the second day after I added some honey,and a little salt, to counteract the vinegar. It actually made my eyes water when I was heating it up the first night.  If you just consider the amount of vinegar compared to the other ingredients, it seems out of proportion, like it's a typo.  I would recommend starting with one-fourth, not three-fourths, cup of vinegar.  You're prepping the sauce in a saucepan before adding it to the chicken so you can always increase the vinegaryness to your liking.  Much easier to add than to subtract. Rating this recipe 4 stars based on adjusting vinegar down to one-fourth cup.  ",
