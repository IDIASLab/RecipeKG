Added my steamed asparagus on top of the cooked chicken, and ladled some of the sauce from the chicken on top, covering with cheese, and putting the foil back on to sit for 5 min.  It turned out great!  I only gave it 4 stars because I had to vary from the recipe steps so much. The sauce is fantastic, and tasted terrific over rice too.",
