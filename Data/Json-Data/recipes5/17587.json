Just mix every 10 seconds at first then every 5 seconds once the chips have softened up until it is combined and smooth. I will make this again and again.",

I added an extra 1/2 cup of marshmallows and made sure to really grease the sides of the pan (the marshmallows like to stick). They fall apart if you eat them hot (but they are sure good hot). Let them cool completely in the pan and they cut into bars really easily. I cooked for 18-20 minutes. Keep an eye on the marshamllows or they burn.",

One other thing- I didn't have butterscotch chips but I did have butterscotch syrup from an ice cream sundae so i used that and it still turned out great! Thanks",
