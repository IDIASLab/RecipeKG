I just wanted to let everyone know that achiote is just yellow coloring. The spice in it won't make or break your recipe. Follow this recipe (plus or minus the water amount - you'll only know after the first try) and add the yellow food coloring last. Add 5-7 drops. Like mom said 'al ojo' which means eyeball it. Additionally, if you do find that your recipe is too watery then add about a teaspoon of cornstarch. My mom has also thickened it by grating about 1/8 of a potato. Again, not an accurate measurement. Apparently when she grew up measuring spoons and cups were just a new fad they never thought would catch on. ",

Sadly we could not have been more disappointed.Achiote not found we used Annato (search engine says it is same(?).We used red sangria wine as were out of white.Recipe divides salt but does not use 2nd half (we tossed it in). No way that all the liquid (5 cups) would fit in the 3/4 safety zone of pressure cooker. We cut back to 3 cups water(still was too much).We used powdered bouillon instead of cubes. Our opinion Color=EXC. Taste=Bland Texture=Too thin and a little oily (We thickened with flour to little avail). We used 3 cubed potatos and they were terribly overcooked after the 40 min. at 15 lbs pressure.The blended trinity of bell pepper garlic & onion was exciting and we will utilize that method in further stew/chili/soup concoctions.We just need to find a better flavor spice base and will keep trying. If the stuff had worked we were gonna call it Guantanamo Stew.",
