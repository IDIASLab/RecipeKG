I left out the onion powder and the italian seasoning and increased the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and it tastes IDENTICAL to The tastefully simple stuff at a fraction of the cost! (I made several loaves with other recipes to get it to taste the same as the good box stuff and this is it!) I also made Jalapeno cheddar bread from it. When I add savory seasonings I use the amount of brown sugar posted in this recipe. If I am making plain bread I use the 1/3 cup! This is the best. It is different than using just self rising flour. I tried that as others have posted and it really is not the same texture. Go with this and you will never spend $5-6 a box again! Thanks for this recipe!",

My bread texture was perfect.  The recipes I have seen previously call for 3 c of flour and 3 T of sugar.  The extra tablespoon of sugar makes the bread a little sweeter.  Also the brown sugar gives it a beautiful dark color.  I switched the Italian seasoning for a creole spice because I thought it would blend better with the meat I was making.  The recipe was as simple to follow as any beer bread and I will use it again.  The only real warning I will give is make sure you use a high quality beer.  I used a Honey Lager and it had great flavor. Cooking with beer is like cooking with wine, if you wouldn't drink it, don't cook with it.",

The bottom line is DON'T ADD ANY baking powder.  Self-rising flour already has baking powder in it, and it is sufficient for this recipe. I also don't add any  Italian or onion spices, it is more versatile without - it's also very good for breakfast this way.",

I used 3 cups of self rising four instead of adding the 1/2 sup of flour, baking powder and salt. I left everything else the same. It's so good and the melted butter over top gives it such a nice crunch! The best part is it's so inexpensive to make.

It wasn't crumbly and dry like most BB's (probably because of the melted butter. The recipe opens up possiblities such as adding shredded cheddar and sun dried tomatoes to the batter or elimating the herbs altogether and throwing in dried cranberries, mixed chopped dried fruits or dates. Would be great toasted. The herb version would make an easy appetizer cut in squares and toasted then topped w. creamed cheese and Jalapeno jelly or whatever. thanks for the recipe, will make it often",

I first made the mix in quart zip lock bags to take to a bake-a-thon at my sister's house. When I got there, I had the bags marked, some had seasonings, both the onion and italian seasonings, some were white or wheat. They all tasted very good. The wheat seemed to make a heartier bread. There was nothing I would change or disliked about any of the variations. I would like to tell you, always make sure your self rising flour is fresh! The leavening added to it will not work as well as you would expect if it is old. Thank you for sharing this recipe.",
