I  wish I could have 3 helpings; even 1/2 of a helping worries me.)    I did add chianti versus white wine , as I felt it makes it a tad hardier.  I also prefer the mini rigatonis, but that is just me.  Minis are the perfect bite.",

However that's my fault, since I knew what I was getting into before I started.  I'd say all the simmering is worth it though as it results in a very deep and unique flavor.  I'd liken it to kind of a sweet and savory stew over pasta.  Quite rich actually.  It's pretty easy to make, with 90% of the actual work being in the preparation. After browning the meat and adding the aromatics, you basically leave it alone, save for a few stirs here and there.  I wouldn't give it the rave reviews as some others have, but it's good.  I'll probably make it again, but more as a change-up than as a staple.\n\n**EDIT**  Just wanted to come back and say that the leftovers are absolutely delicious and far better flavor than the the initial meal.  Really pleased with this sauce even a week after making.\n\n**EDIT2**  It has been a few months since I made this, and now I am absolutely craving it!!  I don't think I realized how much I liked it.  Now bumping this from 4 to 5 stars.  I cook for one and I had so many leftovers.  It froze really well.  I put it in the freezer in single portion containers and then just made some fresh pasta whenever I wanted to have a meal.  Either the flavor just grew on me, or the longer it sits after preparation, the more the flavor improves.  Such a unique taste that I can't wait to have again.",
