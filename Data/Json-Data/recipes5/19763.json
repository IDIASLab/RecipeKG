My mom used to make a much simpler much more Americanized version of \"weenies and kraut\" when I was a kid using hotdogs and without any seasoning besides pepper. While I did enjoy it as a kid I was looking for a bit more sophisticated recipe to try. This hit the spot perfectly. I made it exactly as the recipe calls except I subbed a little dill and cumin seed for the caraway. I'm not a big fan of the licorice flavor spices (anise fennel seed etc) so I did a search for possible substitutions for the caraway. I found dill and cumin suggested as somewhat similar in flavor so I used half a teaspoon of each. I did have to cook it a little longer than 10 minutes before the kraut started to brown a bit. This makes 4 very large portions and could easily feed six people with a side. I served it with some hot german potato salad and the combination was great.",

I had been dying to try it after he told me all about it and I never thought I would but he came through for me. I LOVED it and I really enjoyed this recipe. I have never seen celery flakes around here so I just diced up some celery AND I did cut the brown sugar in half but that is only due to personal preference because I do not like sweet and like the sour bite the kraut gives. This recipe was super easy and super good if you like the kraut. Thanks for sharing!",
