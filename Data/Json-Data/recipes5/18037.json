Used 1/2 cinnamon raisin bread and half french bread, added nutmeg, increased the eggs to 8 and the cooking time to 1 hour with the last 25 minutes uncovered!  Same amount of cinnamon...  Fed eight hungry BIG men who sang my praises.  This is definitely a keeper!!!",

It turned out great, especially thanks to the reviews.  The only thing I am going to do differently when I make it on Friday night is use 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup....there was a buttery film swimming underneath the bread.  We had to drain it, no biggie.  Per other's suggestions, I used Pepperidge Farm Brown Sugar Cinnamon French Toast Bread, cubed (since I will be feeding a large crowd).  Because of the bread, I omitted the cinnamon, except for a dash of cinnamon to the apple mixture.  I also omitted the raisins, personal preference.  I also soaked the bread cubes only in the egg mixture, instead of pouring it over.......I agree with the other reviewer, why would you want your apples swimming in egg?  Yuck.  This way worked great.....the casserole ended up sitting in fridge for 14 hours before being baked, (1/2 hr covered, 15 min uncovered) and the bread was PERFECT!  Puffy and moist, but not soggy.  Thank you for a fantastic brunch recipe!  I tried Creme Brulee French Toast also off this site, not nearly as good as this!\n1/1/06 - this was a HUGE hit at the brunch!!",
