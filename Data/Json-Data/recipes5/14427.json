Bought coleslaw from the deli, and used two bowls of Curly's BBQ pulled pork instead of making my own. 30 minutes in a 425 convection oven was long enough for the tots to be nice and crisp. While I'm sure homemade coleslaw, pulled pork and BBQ sauce would be even better, I've got to say this short cut way was super delicious! I'd serve this to company any day!",

He used his pulled pork, home made bbq sauce that our daughter makes , bread and butter jalapenos and he added some ghost pepper salsa, and I made a lime cilantro cole slaw, other than that he followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome. We are serving this today for our super bowl party.  He would give this more than 5 stars if it was possible.",

Mine had less tots a moderate amount of pork no jalapeno slices mild bbq sauce and cheddar cheese. (Yeah I'm a wimp.) We were both extremely happy with our efforts. Just the way we wanted!
