A few changes may be beneficial: 1) I doubled up on the shiitaki mushrooms and onions and it seemed about the right ration. 2) I made the tomato pesto with 1/2 cup sundried tomatoes in oil and added half again as much fresh basil chopping everything fine. Left out garlic as I put plenty in the main recipe. 3) I used uncooked peeled shrimp and mixed the teaspoon of pepper flakes with the shrimp an hour before cooking. I added the shrimp about 1/3 of the way through the 10-minute simmering cycle and they came out perfect! 4) I undercooked the pasta just a bit (used linguini because that's what I had) and then tossed into the sauce with a few minutes left of simmering time. Sucks up lots of flavor and juice! Enjoy!",
