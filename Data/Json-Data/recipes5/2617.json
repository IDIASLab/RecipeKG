I followed this recipe exactly (well, I used a little extra maple syrup and no sesame seeds) and these came out as the best ribs I have ever had, and I have eaten ribs many times in good restaurants!  I highly reccomend this recipe to anyone, novice or otherwise, who loves great ribs.  Especially if, like me, you like your ribs saucy, sweet and slightly spicy.  I have the recipe memorized now, I have cooked it so often since I first used it!  Go for it, it rocks!",

I probably would have used less orange juice concentrate and curry as it seemed like that's all I could taste but I'm pregnant so my taste buds may be off. I also had to cook them a little longer than listed as I like lots of sauce and the sauce is a bit thin. We did not use the sesame seeds. Excellent paired with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.",

I think they are best served with something else like steak or chicken with a regular BBQ sauce on the beef or chicken or however you like your steak/chicken. Just something to break up the flavor. Also I flavored the ribs with Hickordy Smoked Salt made by McCormick. I find that gives the pork a nice smoked flavor. I don't know if I liked the seaseme seeds or not. My wife liked them I didn't think they were horrable but I plan to leave them off my ribs next time to see if it makes diffrence. Jessica felt the seeds gave it a nice flavor so I would suggjest trying them at least as you may be like her and like them.",
