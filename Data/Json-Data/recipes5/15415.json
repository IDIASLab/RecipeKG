When given the option, I will always choose the grill over the oven. This is an excellent recipe! The marinade is very flavorful and really comes through. It also makes for some extremely tender chicken. I only had time to let it marinate for just over an hour and it was plenty. The one thing I did not love about the recipe was the cabbage. It needed more than just lime sprinkled over it. Maybe some salt? No biggie since the chicken was the star. I will definitely make this recipe again.",
