I don't add oil to the cooked couscous anymore, and I normally use half a can of lentils instead of cooking my own.  They seem to add moisture to the mix.  Instead of mixing the dressing up first I squeeze the lemons directly over the bowl and pour a couple of glugs of oil and drizzle some honey on top.  Just make sure to mix it well.  It's nice to eat right away, but we prefer it the next day after the raisins and cranberries plump up.",
