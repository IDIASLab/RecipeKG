My substitutions are as follows: same quantity of applesauce in place of butter 1 cup each of whole wheat & all-purpose flour maple syrup used in place of brown sugar chia seed (1 TBS soaked in 3 TBS of water for 10 minutes) instead of egg. I also substituted the frosting with homemade maple cream. This turned out fabulous AND we can have guilt-free dessert!",
