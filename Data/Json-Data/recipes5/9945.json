Equal parts of mayonnaise and apple juice, plus vinegar resulted tin a \u201cway-too-runny\u201d dressing, the macaroni was almost swimming in it.  I added a LOT more mayonnaise, and adjusted a few of the seasonings in accordance with that, but the pasta salad still was too \u201cwet\u201d for lack of a better term.  I scaled down the recipe but followed it to the letter, with the exception of using a Gala apple and green cabbage (what I had on hand), and I did add a bit more apple which added a nice pop of sweetness.  If I were to make this again, I\u2019d most likely cut the apple juice back substantially (maybe even eliminate it), since I couldn\u2019t really taste it in the dressing, and maybe even cut the vinegar back a bit as well.  One thing\u2019s for sure, the liquid in the dressing needs to be reduced somewhere.  The recipe doesn\u2019t tell you to do this, but do set aside some time to chill in the fridge.  In spite of the runniness of the salad, the flavor was OK, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was outstanding.  Doubtful I\u2019ll make this one again even with modifications, just movin' on.",
