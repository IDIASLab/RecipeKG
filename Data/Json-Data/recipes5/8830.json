The crumb mix gave this dessert a not too sweet crunchy layer and topping. Really light and creamy dessert. My first-time guest and I both agreed, though, that the creamy cheese mixture was too sweet. The recipe doesn\u2019t need both honey and icing sugar in those quantities, especially if the berries are sweet. My guest initially asked if it was ice cream because it was so creamy. I\u2019d definitely make this again but will reduce the icing sugar or possibly just use honey. Will also try with other fresh fruit, like mango, and perhaps add some unsweetened flaked coconut to the crumb layer & topping!??",

I had to use lemon extract, as only have oranges for zest (and I really wanted something lemony for the 4th of July). I doubled the recipe and used graham crackers and blueberries cuz thats \nwhat I had on hand. I\u00b4m sure this would taste wonderful no matter w! Thanks so much for this great recipe :)",
