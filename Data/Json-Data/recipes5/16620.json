I halved the recipe since 6-8 dozen seemed like a lot of cookies and while I'll admit I only had unbleached all-purpose flour I would still say this recipe halves well. I didn't experience any of the dryness others mentioned (be sure to let the butter soften before use). The cookies came off cleanly from my pans including my normal aluminum pan. The dryness and difficulty cleaning people had mentioned almost turned me off this recipe but with no such difficulties I'm glad I made it.",
