(It should be noted that you can't be coating raw chicken and then using leftover sauce unless the sauce is then cooked, or reserved out before coating the raw chicken. That could be a recipe for food poisoning).",

They coating was so light and crispy.  I did not use the Sriracha sauce because my sweet chili sauce was plenty spicy. It was so delicious.  Best thing I have cooked in a long time.
