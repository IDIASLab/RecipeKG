I bought a box of Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies tasted it and found this cereal super sweet. The only deviation I made from the recipe instructions was reducing the amount of the brown sugar. When this came out of the oven bubbling I sprinkled the chocolate chips on the top waited a few minutes for them to soften but they didn t soften enough to spread them. The recipe doesn t tell you what kind of almonds to use (whole slivers sliced?) so I used sliced but was unable to even press them down into the chocolate because the chips hadn t softened enough. I put this in the fridge overnight and what I ended up with is something that tastes like candy. It falls apart when you try to cut it almonds and chips falling off and looks like you ve broken apart a large piece of candy bark just not easy at all to eat. Not sure what went wrong here but I won t be making this again. I m giving this 2 stars because it didn t taste bad but this was a huge disappointment!",
