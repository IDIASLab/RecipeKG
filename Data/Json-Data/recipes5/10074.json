It tasted like something you would get at an expensive restaurant.  It was real easy to make, too.  I think that it was meant to be used as a small appetizer served in a cup, thats why the servings are so small.  It does, however make a generous 2 servings, if you are using it as a main dish (especially since its SO filling!).  I served it with cheese-garlic biscuits, a winning combo.",

I used fresh Jonah crabmeat and minced shrimp (although I now agree with other reviewers who said, \"Use one or the other seafood, not both.\"  The textures do not mesh well, at least not for me.)  I increased both the butter and flour to 3T, and added one pressed clove of garlic as the butter melted on low heat (caution: do NOT allow the garlic to turn brown; it becomes bitter, and will ruin the whole thing) and stirred in the flour as the garlic became fragrant.  Added a little onion powder and some parsley mixed in the flour, and used chicken base, as that is what I had on hand. I split the difference with the wines;  I added 1/4 cup of each!  After the second adding of half and half, I customized the seasonings for our taste -- paprika for colour, Old Bay, and a dash of cayenne.  Fabulous, fabulous, FABULOUS recipe!

I left out the chicken bouillion, made my roux and then sauted some garlic, the green onions and the crab meat, so the crab could really soak up that flavor. \nNext I added about half of the 1/2 and half and a TON of paprika--probably 3 Tblsp. \n\nOnce it began to thicken I added the rest of the half and half and about a cup of sherry instead of wine and 1/2 tsp of white pepper. It was perfect!!\n\nThanks for a yummy recipe!!",
