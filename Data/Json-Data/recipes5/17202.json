I highly recommend using mace for this - it's much spicier than a cinnamon/nutmeg combination and really creates the flavor. I parboiled the apple slices in about an inch of water to soften them up a bit since the potatoes were already cooked. My last try resulted in soft potatoes and solid apples so that did the trick!
