I read the reviews before making them and the only things I would say is that if you're like me and you have the \"just add water\" kind of pancake mixes (the kind that doesn't require eggs or oil, etc), you might NOT want to use all the milk in the recipe. The addition of the eggs and applesauce thinned the batter down considerably. Good thing I added the milk a little bit at a time, and didn't need to use all of it in the end; it would have been a very runny batter otherwise. I would also cut down on the cinnamon, as I would've liked to have tasted more of the apple flavor. I think the name is misleading; these should be called cinnamon pancakes. From the name, I was expecting more of an apple flavor. Maybe next time I'll add some fresh, thinly sliced apples to the mix.",

I used sour milk and an organic blueberry applesauce I bought cheaply at Grocery Outlet. I served it with Homemade Pancake Syrup, which is also from this site. My kids inhaled them. There were some leftover, so I froze them two a piece in freezer bags. All I have to do is heat them in the toaster next morning I'm short on time. EDITED REVIEW: I have made these pancakes many times now. One of my favorite ways to make it is using homemade apple butter in place of the apple sauce with my homemade pancake mix. My whole family loves it. There's rarely any leftovers.",

These pancakes are very filling, and make quite a bit, so sticking with the original might have been okay!  I did add about 1/3 cup more milk as my hubby hates thick pancakes.  (I have been through numerous pancake recipes trying to find one he would like)  They ended up still being very thick.  But to my delight he said these were his absolute favorite pancakes.  And as an added bonus they made the house smell wonderful!  I will definately keep this recipe!!  Thank You!",
