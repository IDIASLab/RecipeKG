Just rub and braise tenderloin on hot skillet then pour all the rest of the ingredients together into the skillet (juices water and veggies) and cover on medium heat until meat and veggies are done (about 30-45 minutes). I also substituted apple juice for orange juice (personal preference) - not citrus flavor just enhances the apple flavor a bit. Wonderful recipe husband has requested this for Christmas dinner.
