Like others, I also use ground pecans in place of the hazelnuts, but I also find that a spicy gingersnap makes for a better crust.

I used pecans instead of hazelnuts (because I wanted them to compliment the praline garnish I used. I baked the cheesecake in a water bath to avoid cracking. I made my praline with pecans. After the sugar/water mixture came to a med./ dark caramel color when boiling I then spread the pecans on a buttered surface until they hardened. Spread so they don't touch. Set aside enough cute shiny whole pecans for a garnish for each piece. Chop up the rest for your praline garnish. I made fresh whipped cream with vanilla bean vanilla & sugar. Presentation: take your slice of pumpkin cheesecake put a large dollop of the vanilla bean whipped cream (letting is slide down each side of the cheesecake slice). Sprinkle 1-2 TB of the pecan praline on top of the whipped cream and sides of serving plate. Finally on top of the dollop add one shiny whole praline coated pecan. Enjoy! -Wendy Copeland",

                "reviewBody": "Well not really sure how to rate this. Overall it was pretty tasty but I wish the baking directions were a bit more detailed. For one the crust hieght listed before baking should be about an inch shorter. The crust rises so high that when you cool the cake the walls stay high and the middle sinks creating a crator like shape (not attractive). Secondly you should probably take the cake out about a half hour sooner than listed. When you leave it out to cool it continues to cook. Mine came out a bit over cooked. Good luck!",

If yours have a tendency to crack try cooking for a shorter amount of time then turn off the oven and leave the cake in there for about an hour--it will continue to cook but not at the high heat resulting in less (or no!) cracks.",

I followed the directions but did end up adding some additional spices. I added cloves nutmeg and extra cinnamon. I think my extra spices made a big difference as the flavor was WONDERFUL!! I enjoyed the gingersnap crust but i had to use pecans because i didnt have any hazelnuts. YUM! I baked it in a water bath and i think it helped keep it from cracking.
