This recipe is a lower fat version - I use skim milk and low fat butter. If you want to make it fancier (but more fattening) you can use cream or whole milk. With the onion, you can always use the minced dried kind to make things go faster and to make it less lumpy. Thanks bd.weld :)",

Wouldn't change a thing - the sauce was creamy bright and fresh with the lemon. I cooked up some diced chicken in olive oil with salt and pepper then removed that from the pan and followed the directions as written. My whole family enjoyed this and I would definitely use this one again. The only thing I might change is to add some diced steamed broccoli asparagus or peas to the mixture to make it a complete one-pan-meal.:)",
