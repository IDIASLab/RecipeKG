(And I ate their scraps.)\" Unusual combination of toppings went onto this open-faced sandwich, the only one of which I didn't have was a sunflower seed \"nose.\" Eldest kiddo ate all of the ingredients off and didn't want cold cream cheese on cold bread. Youngest ate everything other than the carrots and the pineapple. Based on the plate remains and how they tasted to me, along with what they didn't want to eat, and factoring in cute points, we'll go with a 3. Playing around with ingredients might make it a more successful feline-shaped sammie for us. I'm thinking a peanut butter cat with banana eyes, raisin facial features and pretzel whisker.",

Nose was also a blueberry. Mouth was a semicircle of strawberry, and whiskers were sliced cheddar cheese cut into matchsticks. Took about 3minutes to do a sandwich...fast, fun healthy lunch idea!",
