I chopped some extra fresh tomatoes and threw those in to up the veggie content. I used leftover hotdog rolls cubed. I also used 4 eggs milk and no stock. I then microwaved it covered for about 6 mins. Added grated cheese and then 2 mins more. Fab idea!",

It is not only a quick and easy recipe but very delicious as well! I was surprised at the wonderful flavors of the dish. Instead of diced tomatoes I used a thick tomatoe sauce (great way to use leftover meatballs and spaghetti sauce as well). Since I omitted the red wine I increased the chicken broth to 3/4 cup to balance the liquid ingredients. I poured the chicken broth on first then the egg mixture and then the meat mixture mixing gently after each addition. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes before placing in oven so that more of the liquids can be absorbed by the bread. Baked for 30 minutes.",
