I did cut the cinnamon back some and that worked better for our tastes. This was very easy to make and smelled wonderful while it was baking. The pine nuts sort of 'fell' off the top but I think if I would've pressed them in a bit that would've fixed that problem lol. All in all this was tasty and I would make it again!

So it nice to have some quantities to go by. I grew up with the cinnamon flavors not allspice etc as other reviewers suggested so I prefer the cinnamon. I grated a medium onion for this so you don't have big chunks in the meat and it needs about a full tsp of salt maybe more so it's not too bland. Also you should use the lowest fat percentage beef you can find (97% is the best). Dip the cooked product in ketchup. Yum! Thanks!",

We did one thing differently which may help with the pine nuts falling off. My mother always divided the mixed meat and pressed half of it into the baking pan and then sprinkled the pine nuts over the meat. Then she spread the rest of the meat on top. The pine nuts were sandwiched between the two layers thus solving the problem of them falling off.",

We still agreed that the cinnamon was a little strong so we'll try with only 1 next time. We also topped it with walnuts because we didn't have pine nuts but we'll definitely try them next time!
