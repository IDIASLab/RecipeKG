After making it I thought the lemon over powered the mint and cilantro so I strained it in cheesecloth and let about 3 tablespoons of liquid out replaced it with a little water and added a little sugar to taste blended it in the chopper again. After doing this I looked up other mint chutney recipes and they called for sugar. Maybe the tamarind juice would have been better but I didn't have any. The end result was good so I would suggest adding the lemon juice to taste.",
