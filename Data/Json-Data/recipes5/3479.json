Am I the only one that actually GOES to the store to buy the necessary ingredients to make a recipe??? There was nothing wrong with the way this recipe was written ...and yes, I followed the recipe and bought ALL necessary ingredients. Please just add this recipe to your circulation and buy all the ingredients and follow the recipe because you will find that this dish is really very good...just as written! Thank you Bill Pollackov for posting such a yummy recipe that my whole family loved!",

I used canned crab ( more affordable) and frozen pre-cooked shrimp and the taste was still great. The only change I made was to put the stuffed zucchini in a glass dish and put a few tablespoons of water on the bottom. If the water evaporated I would add a little more. It keeps the food moist. We loved the flavor and how crisp the zucchini stayed. This is a keeper and will be a summer favorite. Thanks!",
