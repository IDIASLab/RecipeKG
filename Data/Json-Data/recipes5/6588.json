We like them both equally however the difference in price is 14 a pound. The second change I made is that I used fresh Chinese noodles. I have no issues with Ramen noodles whatsoever but I had fresh on hand and fresh area always better in my opinion. My two changes have nothing to do with my rating. My rating is based on the flavor of the sauce. I really liked the flavor the capers brought to the dish but overall I still felt it was lacking something. Fresh parsley was the first thing to come to my mind but there is still something else and I cannot put my finger on it. The cooking method did work nicely.",
