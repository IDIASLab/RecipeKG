My poblanos were on the small side but are usually pretty hot so I didn't want to add another. The tomatillos were also small so I added a couple extras. I will try this again because I like the roasted flavor but I will probably reduce the onion or add it at the end rather than first so they don't get as pulverized. I tried to make it smoother so they may have released too much juices. SAFETY NOTE: One of my tomatillos burst on the grill and squirted hot juice at me.EDIT2/17/10 made again but minced onion & garlic by hand and added at end with much better results. BTW the red is an extra ripe pepper nothing mysterious.",

I used two small jalape\u00f1os in lieu of serranos peppers since my garden is full of them. The first couple bites lacked flavor for us but certainly not heat. So we added more cilantro a good squeeze of fresh lime and couple dashes of cumin and some fresh oregano from the garden...much better flavor. I did enjoy the roasted flavor and if I make again I'll roast the onion and garlic also. So with a little bit of tweaking this is a pretty good salsa.",
