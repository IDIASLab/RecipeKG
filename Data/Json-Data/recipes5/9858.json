All I needed to add was a bit of salt at the end.  If you don't want your veggies too soft, I suggest you cook the meat for 20-25 minutes under pressure, add in the veggies, then finish cooking for 10-15 more minutes. There was no indication on how to prepare the potatoes, so I peeled them and cut them into 1.5\" chunks.  The beef comes out so tender. This has the perfect amount of heat, not overly spicy at all. I garnished with some minced cilantro. Perfect!",
