I can tell by the ingred list and the process that this tastes rich and wonderful with a good spreading consistency. Next time my friend's mom picks her tree I will make this! BTW you can boiling-water bath your filled jars & give your product a longer shelf life. After filling jars to w/in 1/4-in wipe rims clean and secure lids & bands. Put jars in a lrg pot of boiling water (1- to 2-in coverage over jar tops) with a little rack on the bottom. Bring water to boil cover time boiling for 5-10 min remove jars set them on a cooling rack for 1-3 hrs. After lids \"pop\" store jars in a cool dry place (not the fridge) and wait 14-21 days before use (check for color changes). Unopened product will last up to 1 yr; refrigerate after opening & it'll last as long as it usually does maybe a little longer! Happy Cooking and Bon Appetit!",

Thankfully I found this recipe and now I've got a few mason jars of the stuff. At my wife's request I cut way down on the cinnamon using maybe 1/2 of the amount listed and the spicing at that amount is quite adequate in my opinion. As to other changes: I didn't have any agave syrup so I substituted honey and it worked well. I also threw in about 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt along with the cinnamon and cloves. I have never had persimmon butter before. It reminds me strongly of pumpkin pie filling--making me think I may turn one of these jars into a persimmon pie for the holidays.",

I'd recommend lightly toasting slices of brick oven bakery bread spreading with goat cheese and topping with a layer of the persimmon butter. It's truly delicious. One thing I did differently was to further concentrate the butter by placing it in a shallow baking dish at 275 degrees for an hour or so stirring periodically. Enjoy!",
