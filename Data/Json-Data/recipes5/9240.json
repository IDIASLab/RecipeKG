We all loved it so much that we came up with our own version that is just as good as the take-out one. This has become an all-time favorite in our house. Serve with your favorite tomato sauce, cream sauce, or other topping sauce. We serve this over spaghetti noodles, then top with favorite sauce sprinkled with cheese.

The best part about this dish is the fact that sauce is optional.  It was a slight bit confusing that pasta sauce is in the ingredients list when it is baked without, but I cannot rate this any less than giving it the 5 star rating it deserves, and totally understood.  I recommend adding the warmed sauce after it comes out of the oven on your individual serving plates, rather than putting all the sauce on and baking it, which may be assumed.  Left overs will stay more fresh if sauce is added right before putting it in the microwave.  So delicious!",

I followed the directions exactly, but used totally different ingredients for the cheese mixture because I wanted to use food I already had. I used about 3 ounces of grated Parmesan, 2 cloves minced garlic, 4 ounces of fresh feta crumbles and a tablespoon of cream cheese softened, to make sure the cheese mixture stuck together well. I also added a little thinly sliced green onion, salt, pepper, a sprinkle of garlic powder, & a sprinkle of cayenne. It was the best recipe I've made in a while & hubs loved it too!",

Kids also raced about it and my daughter loves the idea of a meatless meal. \n\nI Modified the filing to include several spices as well as mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. I followed the instructions for the filling  and just added about a cup each of the extra cheeses to and stirred it really well - it made more of a thick paste that stuck to the eggplant really well when preparing them for the oven. .i followed everything else pretty closely except I added seasonings to the flour as well as the egg and I added a cup of grated Kraft  Parmesan/Romano  to the bread crumb mix. \n\nOverall this was a huge hit with my skeptical family and I just made an eggplant lover out of a very picky man!
