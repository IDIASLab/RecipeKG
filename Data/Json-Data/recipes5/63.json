I felt my sauce was spicy enough. The first time I made these I otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I found there was a little too much sauce for 24 oz. of meatballs so I upped it to a 32-oz. package and that seemed just right. Also the first time I made them some of the balls got burned on the bottom so the second time I didn't use the saute step. I just mixed up the sauce ingredients tossed in the meatballs and set the pot on high pressure for 5 minutes as called for. A couple of the meatballs still were a bit browned on the bottom but not nearly as badly and my pot didn't give me a \"burn\" warning. I saw that someone tried using orange marmalade and that sounds good so I might try that next time.",
