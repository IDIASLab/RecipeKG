Just mixed up in bowl with spices and rest of ingredients didn't need to puree it mashed up really quick and easy. It smells divine while cooking and tastes fantastic. Not too sweet and while you could taste the cinnamon I don't think it overpowered the dish. When I can get a smaller amount of the cardamom I will make this again because there seems to be no substitute for the spice and I am curious to see what extra flavor it brings to the dish. It has been years and years since I used cardomam and is supposed to lend a great flavor to the dish. Less butter I think the next time there was enough fat with the thighs it doesn't need that much. Thanks for the recipe!",
