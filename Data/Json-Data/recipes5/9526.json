Three thoughts:  1) In trying to figure out what might have been different from those reubens that restaurants make--it was the meat.  Restaurants usually provide more meat, making for a much thicker, more substantial sandwich, and 2) \"medium-high\" seems a little too hot.  The sandwiches seem to brown too quickly, nearly burning--before the cheese is melted.  I know this is not rocket science for you experienced cooks, but I'm still learning, and 3) It would be nice if these held together better, but I think the rulebook requires that Reubens be messy.  I cut the sandwiches in half, and even in quarters for my mother-in-law, who has dementia, and they were much easier to handle.  Five stars, baby.",
