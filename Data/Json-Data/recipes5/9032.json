I also put shredded cheese on top before putting it under the broiler. Do NOT use the amount of cayenne pepper called for in the recipe. There must be a mistake, 1 teaspoon was way too much. (unless you like really spicy frittata). Next time I make this, I might change the seasonings to more basil/oregano/thyme/parsley seasonings, rather than what is listed here.",
