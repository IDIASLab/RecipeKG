No peeling necessary and they stay a pretty bright red for added color. Wobbly bacon is another dislike of mine and with this treatment of the bacon, you get all of the flavor throughout the soup and still get to keep the crispy goodness to use on top for garnish.",

I am fairly new to the Instant Pot and like every other dish I have tried it took much longer for the pressure to build and also to naturally release. After over 15 minutes I released the pressure.
