I also didn't have any fresh parsley, so I substituted 1.5 Tbsp dried. The amount of spices is perfect and I like how the tomatoes don't overwhelm the taste of the salmon. I made my husband salmon with a sweeter sauce (I'm diabetic and can't share), and he kept trying to steal bits of mine anyway! I served it over brown rice instead of white for a healthier meal, and served it with steamed asparagus and fresh green beans. Very good and it tastes wonderfully fresh.",

I tried it yesterday and it's just as tasty.  This is a FABULOUS dish! Below is my original review ... \n\nI made it last night and I thought my husband was going to pick up the plate to lick off the very last of the sauce!  \n\nI made just a couple of easy changes ... I used brown rice rather than white, simply because it's a little healthier and I think brown has a better flavor.  I used Mexican diced tomatoes since that's all I had, they were spicy and I figured that was what was being called for so what the heck?  \n\nThis dish is good enough for the PICKIEST of in-laws or children, a wonderful recipe for company or a romantic evening at home with your honey.

I did serve it over angel hair pasta which was great. I feel bad about saying that I \"tweaked\" the recipe just a bit but I did. It seemed that the salmon needed just a bit more sauce and so I added about 1/4 cup of dry white wine and about 1/2 cup of heavy cream. It was so delicious! Thank you for sharing the recipe.",
