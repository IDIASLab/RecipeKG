Interestingly enough I liked the sauce immediately after making it and less after sitting while I did the rest of the cooking. I think we also pulverized the dill a little much tasted like fresh mowed grass to me. I might use dried dill next time as I like it much better. I also thought the sauce tasted a little too sweet and lemony so I may throw some capers in there and be careful watch the lemon next time. Served this with roasted asparagus and baked potato - dynamite how fast this all comes together. 15 min at 425 for the asparagus 11 minutes for the salmon 5 minutes in the microwaved wrapped in a wet paper towel for the potatoes! Sauce on all of it;)",
