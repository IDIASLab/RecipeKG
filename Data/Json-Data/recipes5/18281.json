I had some leftover pineapple juice so subbed part of that for the water.  I also added 3 cloves crushed garlic, only lightly packed the brown sugar, was 2 tbsp shy of the rice vinegar so added more lemon juice to make up the difference.  I grated the rind of one whole medium orange which equaled 2 tbsp. and put the pulp from that orange into the 'brew'.  Didn't have green onion so subbed some red onion for that.  Thanks for the suggestion of the sesame oil...love that nutty flavor it gives.  I didn't coat the chicken w/flour.  I just heated some wok oil and stir fried it that way.  Added some red pepper chunks to the stirfry for flavor and color(yum) and served over basmati rice. I made the cornstarch slurry using orange juice instead of water. Garnished with cilantro.  This is a definite keeper...wish there were more stars. One of the best Asian dishes I have made so far...not too tart, not too sweet.  Just the right balance.  One would swear this came from the Chinese carry-out.",

The best option for this would most certainly be to use a wok.  Adding a touch of Sesame oil to the olive oil adds flavor, and doesn't add much cholesterol or fat.  Also, most Chinese restaraunts use batter-dipped chicken as opposed to this recipe's use of marinade and flour, making it a -much- healthier choice than ordering out.  All in all, fantastic variance on the Orange Chicken recipe.",

I've made it twice already and followed suggestions from others like using less cornstarch and subbing pineapple juice for some of the water, also added a little sriracha for a kick and it turned out very flavorful.  However, if you want the breading to stick to the chicken, dip it first in a beaten egg mixed w/ a little bit of water (to thin it out) before rolling in the flour breading, this works really well...re-dip in egg and flour again for a thicker/crispier breading.  It's a little bit more work, but trust me it pays off because this way you can cook the chicken with the sauce at the end without worrying about the breading falling off.",

For the sauce I used 1 c. of water and 1/2 c. of orange juice plus the juice of 1/2 of one small orange and then cut up the other half into small pieces and added that. I didn't have fresh ginger root, so I used powdered ginger and used a bit more garlic.  What I like about this sauce is you can modify it to suite your tastes.  I let the chicken marinate all day. (I might try this one on the grill over the summer).  For the breading I added a little garlic powder to the flour mixture and took the advice of another reviewer and dipped the chicken into egg thinned out with a little water.  The breading stuck to the chicken perfectly and after cooking I removed it then thickened the sauce. (start with a small amount of cornstarch and water 2 tsp. to 1 Tbsp. and thicken desired consistency) I served it over rice, and a vegetable medley of steamed broccoli, red peppers, baby corn, and carrots.",

I followed other reviews, and let the chicken stay crisp keep warm in a 200 degree oven after I fryed it.  When everything was ready, I served it family style in a big bowl.  I layered white rice, then a mixture of veggies (pea pods, carrots, broccoli, and mushrooms that I stir-fryed in a little of the sauce), the chicken, then I poured the orange sauce over it.  Finally, I topped with sliced almonds and crispy noodles.  Update:  I've made this again since my 1st review, and we've decided that this is definitly a 5 star recipe instead of the original 4 stars.  I think I finally found a good balance with the orange zest!",

If you still find the sauce to be starchy, next time you try it, you can leave 1 tbs of oil in the pan after frying the chicken and add the cornstarch to that and cook stirring frequently for ~5 minutes before adding the rest of the sauce...it will have the same thickening effect.
