For company, I've thinned the sauce with some chicken broth or white wine and served it over angel hair pasta for a more formal presentation. I created this because I wanted a recipe that uses the items I have in my pantry every day. This and a salad and you are done! You can use mostaccioli or another dry short pasta in place of the pipette, if desired.",
