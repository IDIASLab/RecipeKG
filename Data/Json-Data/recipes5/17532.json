The first time I made it I had to wing it with a few of the ingredients (I was short on brown sugar) and I also used raw kielbasa instead of pre-cooked (smoked??) like hillshire farms or the like. When I made it the first time it was good but didn't make me rave over it. I decided to give it another go for my superbowl party and this time I made sure I had all of the ingredients on hand (I also tripled the recipe to accomodate the amount of guests I had). I used hillshire farms kielbasa this time and WOW what a difference it was! This is a fantastic recipe and I will most definitely be using it again and again and again.",

I used 14 oz of ketchup and doubled the amount of Kielbasa as suggested by others - I had plenty of sauce and enough yummy Kielbasa to feed an army!  I knew I'd be rushed for time on the day that I wanted to make this, so I browned the onion, made the sauce, and sliced the kielbasa the night before, placed it all in a gallon size zipper bag and stored it in the fridge overnight.  In the morning I just dumped everything in the crock pot and turned it on low for 5 hours.  I suppose I could have used a crock pot cooking bag instead of a zipper bag, but I didn't have any on hand.  Anyway, I used regular kielbasa and I have to mention that there was about an inch of rendered fat on top of the sauce when the kielbasa finished cooking, but it was easily removed.  The sauce is so tasty that I plan to serve the leftovers over rice.",

I figured 28 oz. would be way to much ketchup. 14 oz. was just right as far as flavor goes and I'm sure this must be what the recipe meant. It was pretty good although I still had way to much sauce and probably could have added another sausage or cut the sauce in half.",
