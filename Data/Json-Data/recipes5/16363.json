Heres a tip:  I found that if I use a good brand of bran (kellogs or the like) it absorbs much better then the cheaper no name brand.  After a long time of refrideration the no name brand will still be quite \"sloshy\", rather then absorbing moisture while in the fridge it seemed to absorb during the baking time.  Not a big deal just a matter of personal preference I guess.",

                "reviewBody": "I've been using this recipe for several years and just now remembered to review it.  :o)  It is the BEST bran muffin recipe I've ever tried.  I did make some changes, as it looks like most everyone else did too.  I use apple juice and chopped apples instead of the pineapple juice and raisins originally called for.  I also add 1 tsp cinnamon and a dash of cloves to the flour mixture.  I had a problem with the cereal retaining some of the flour and having white clumps on it, so I mix the cereal in separately - after the flour mixture has been incorporated with the wet ingredients.  You need to use bran FLAKES - I buy the store brand that says 100% whole bran flakes and it works great.  I've also subbed applesauce for the oil, and the only difference noted was they didn't rise quite as much.  I use olive oil if I leave the oil in, and it doesn't taste olive-y after it's cooked.  I've also made them with pineapple juice and chopped pineapple, and it's excellent that way also.  The batter is very thin initially, but I let it sit overnight and it's perfect in the morning.  I use an ice cream scoop to measure into the muffin tins.  I normally make a double batch of muffins and freeze them.  Thank you so much for an awesome recipe!  Definitely FIVE STARS!",

                "reviewBody": "These muffins came out beautifully! I used General Mills' All-Bran cereal and was out of raisins so I looked through my pantry and decided on using apricots which I chopped. Another difference I made was using Juicy Juice brand's Orange Tangerine juice instead of pineapple juice (didn't have any). After chilling for 3 hours I used a cookie-dough spring action-type scoop to distribute the batter into the muffine cups - 2 scoops was the perfect amount to fill regular-sized muffin tins. I baked the muffins for 15 minutes and they came out perfectly - 20 min. would be way too long. In the end I was able to make 27 muffins not bad.:) The next time I make these I think I would crush the bran cereal a bit to avoid the bran \"chunks\" as I call them. I think making the bran a bit more discreet would be better. Also I baked the muffins in aluminum muffin cups. This didn't change the speed of cooking (they ended up the same aas they would if they were in paper ones); but I did this so I could keep them fresh by refrigerating then I can heat them up in the toaster oven each morning so I could have a 'hot fresh muffin.'",

And I did use pineapple juice because I happened to have some on hand - I love what pinapple juice does for these muffins! Just great! I made half the muffins after the batter chilled for 3 hours and only had to bake them 15 minutes before they were done. I will make the rest of them tomorrow and see if they can possibly be any better(I doubt it)!",
