When cooking the farro, I used water instead of chicken broth and added salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and a little sherry.  Instead of kale, which I am not a huge fan of unless it is in chip form, I used 10 ounces of frozen spinach which I heated up before incorporating it into the salad. I sauteed fresh sliced garlic in the oil and then added it to the farro salad.  I also added one can of drained cannellini beans.  Lastly, I had crumbled feta cheese with cranberries in the house so I used that instead. I can't wait to share this recipe with my parents and co-workers.  It is delicious!",

Made this as instructed except that I didn't have any kale spinach or similar greens to use so I chopped up some steamed asparagus that I had and added that into the mix- yum! Has a very tasty savory zest with the lemon really pulling together and enhancing the flavors of the garlic and pepper. During seconds decided to try for a slightly different flavor and added some raisins which worked really well giving a very subtle sweetness to the dish. Overall a very delicious nutritious- and filling!- recipe that could definitely stand on its own as a meal. Great recipe! Thank you Cris ( v )",
