Again tonight I subbed thick-cut boneless pork loin chops (that were VERY lean) for the lamb, and subbed about 1/2 water for 1/2 of the required oil.  What I did differently was to sub rosemary for tarragon and 2 TEASPOONS LIME juice for 2 Tbs. lemon juice.  Added a healthy sprinkle of soy sauce to the mixture.  Used a Zip-Lock bag to marinate the chops 2 hrs. in the fridge, and then let them come to room temp. for about 1 hr. before grilling them on high for 5 a side.  Absolutely WONDERFUL this way.  I could not give up on this recipe until I made it work for pork!  Enjoy!!!",
