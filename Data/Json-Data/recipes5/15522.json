Upgrades I made were to include 1 (16 oz) jar of Mrs. Renfro's mild salsa in the layering and to add 1 spicy guacamole mix packet to the guacamole to give it some zip (the spice packet can be found in most produce sections). The layering should be refried beans, salsa, guacamole, sour cream/mayo/seasoning mixture, etc. The reason for this is the first time I made it and placed the salsa next to the sour cream mixture it made one big mess on the platter and didn't look to appetizing (even though everyone inhaled it). The second time around it look much better on the plate when the salsa was not next to the sour cream mixture.  Great easy appetizer for any ball game!",
