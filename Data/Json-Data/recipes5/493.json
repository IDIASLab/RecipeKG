I had to add a little bit of cream to the chocolate to make it a coatable consistency for the puffs. I don't know how much coating the puffs should have but it didn't seem like quite enough to me. The white chocolate does taste good and it is super sweet (almost too much so for us). Thanks Jeannine for a 2-ingredient recipe. There aren't too many of them around.",

Easiest recipe ever and everyone will go nuts over it. I have family members who camp out next to the bowl at holiday functions bc they can't get enough of this stuff. If you do add sprinkles add them on the cookie sheet right before they go on the freezer. If you add them before tossing the sprinkles will melt. If you add them after the freezer the sprinkles won't stick.",
