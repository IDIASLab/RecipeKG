Following the recipe exactly, I found Swiss chard stem fibres in my pesto (which I thought detracted from the finished product esthetically). I'd recommend three small changes to the recipe.  First, cook the Swiss chard stems & garlic first, until softened... then add the leaves and cook until wilted.  Second, the recipe needs a bit more salt, about 1.5 tsp was just about right.  It makes a big difference after it's mixed into the pasta.  Finally, I recommend changing the blending order. Begin by blending the 1/2 cup olive oil with the cooked Swiss Chard/garlic mixture.    Blend until smooth. THEN add the remaining ingredients to the blender.  Blend at a medium speed so that the pesto maintains a slightly course texture.  \nImmediately after blending, before the pesto discolors, I spoon the pesto into two ice cube trays and freeze.  It thaws beautifully.  \nIt's delicious on pasta and I can't wait to try it on garlic toast, chicken, fish and whatever else I can imagine... all winter!",
