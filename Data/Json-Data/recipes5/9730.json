I did customize this recipe a bit though. 1. marinate in apple juice over night turn once. 2. I added 1 sm.can diced tomatoes. 3. 1 can mushroom soup Be carefull when you place venison cubes into frying skillet that there is room to turn them to brown otherwise the breading will fall off.

I have been eating wild meat for years. My grandma taught me a trick she's used for years. She will either soak the meat overnight (or all day) in either milk or salted water. I use the salted water. The salt helps pull the blood out of the meat and in turn eliminates most of the gamey taste. As the day goes on empty the water rinse and add the more salted water. The milk works well too but milk is a little expensive and it seems like such a waste! Best of luck using these techiniques!",
