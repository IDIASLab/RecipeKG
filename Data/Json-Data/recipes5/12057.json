My 11yo wasn't sure if he wanted to eat them but I made him at least try them and 10 minutes later his plate was pretty much licked clean. We just picked them up and ate them. I did not drain my meat after cooking them so they were a little greasy. next time I will drain first. One of hubbies favorites.",

I did par boil the green peppers which you really have to do otherwise they will be pretty tough. So what's missing? Some flavor. As a quick fix we spooned a little bit of medium salsa on them which helped immensely. It does take things away from the philly cheese stake genre a little but it needed it. Make it again? Definitely. I will layer some extra provolone inside as well as a tablespoon or so of salsa in there.",
