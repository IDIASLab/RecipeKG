Two cans of condensed soup and a packet of onion soup mix is a lot of processed food, and mixing it with coconut milk just seemed . . . odd.  Odd and a little wrong.  But I'm always on the lookout for interesting slow-cooker meals, so I gave it a shot.  Really, it's not half bad.  Completely unlike any curry I've ever had, except for the curry powder, but not half bad.  Taste-wise, it probably deserves four stars, but I'm giving it three because I still find the heavy reliance on processed ingredients disturbing (as well as the sodium content - yikes!)  That said, it was easy and my husband liked it, so I might make it again.  Definitely doesn't need that extra 1/2 tsp of salt, though; there's plenty in the three soup products.",

I don't use any cream of anything soups or soup mixes - too much processed food gives me migraines - so I did it all from scratch. I melted a hunk of butter(2 tbsp-ish) in a pan, sauteed the onions and some carrots and celery in the pan, then added 2 tbsp flour - cooked the flour a bit till it all had color. I added the can of coconut milk when I'd have normally added milk (I'm used to making country gravy). I added the spices tasted it - it was a little bland because of the lack of onion soup mix, so I spiced it up a little - salt, pepper, garlic, and the peas then dumped it over the cut on chicken in the crock pot and let it cook. Same general idea but without the migraine.",

Here is what I did. It is a snowy day here in N. Virginia so I did not have all the ingredients on hand and grocery store only 1 mile away was not an option. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and placed in bottom of crockpot. I did not have cream of mushroom soup so I just doubled the cream of chicken soup. I did not have coconut milk and after research online ended up just using sourcream. I doubled the recipe for my family of 5 but only used 1 tsp of cayenne. I placed baby carrotts on top of the chicken and poured the curry sauce over. It has been cooking for almost 3 hours now and smells heavenly!!!! I usually don't like reviews when people have not tried or made the recipe but I am positive this one is gonna be a keeper. Gonna serve with rice and steamed veggies. I'll check back after dinner and let you know how the family rates it...",
