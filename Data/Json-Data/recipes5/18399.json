I love how easy it is to accomodate everyone's taste; you can make it hotter or milder just by varying the types and amount of peppers used. The jars store well and last a very long time. I make this recipe all the time. It is a healthy low fat condiment that goes well on everything from scrambled eggs to hot dogs. Well done KB CountryGirl!!;-)",

Also we thought it was a tad sweet so we will omit the brown sugar the next time we make this. Bueno salsa! Thanks for sharing!",

I found I did need the cornstarch to thicken things up at the end. I also added 1/2 cup fresh cilantro towards the end what can I say I love cilantro. I will make this again and again.
