The one in the picture could be achieved with mini-bundts, maybe, but I'm not sure. Anyway this tasted great, naturally. I would chill my Bailey's in the future to provide a great contrast to the warm filling. The photo I took does not do the recipe any favors, so I won't post it. Thanks for sharing!",

I made a chocolate cake and followed the recipe as stated (added some red sprinkles for lava fun) and tried to get a picture before my cake just sopped up all the Baileys but it involved pouring it and photographing at the same time. So I liked the whole concept of this cake and believe it would be even better by making mini bundt cakes using a pan for that purpose. Then use chocolate fudge (not just a chocolate syrup) or even a glaze that hardens a bit. THEN pour the Baileys in and over the sides. If you like your cake soaking it up then this is perfect for you as written but I felt kind of like I missed the lava effect because my cake was Baileys thirsty. Anyways it's fun and different and is definitely a good base to play around with because you can't really go wrong with whipped cream ice cream or anything else that you might normally enjoy with chocolate cake.",
