It smelled incredibly delicious while cooking, but everyone labeled it as too bland, which was surprising given the large measurements of spices compared to the volume of the sauce. The sauce itself was not too bad, but the chicken had no flavor at all. I only marinated the poultry for one hour -- maybe longer would have helped. I hope some of the others who have saved this recipe enjoy it, because it truly had an interesting combination of ingredients, and the aroma was wonderful. Perhaps my family is too geared towards spicy foods...",
