I knew 2 lbs of baby back ribs would never feed my family of four...and at 6.99 a lb I was reluctant to try a new recipe on such expensive cut. This marinade would work an any cut of pork! I will try it next on country style ribs as those are my favorite since they are so meaty. I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce as others suggested. One suggestion though...don't use the whole bottle it can overwhelm the delicate taste of the delicious marinade. The sauce should complement but not dominate. We enjoyed them very much! Thanks Mike!",
