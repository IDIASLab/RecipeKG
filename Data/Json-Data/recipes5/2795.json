However, I add 1 c of sour cream to the soup/mayo/lemon juice/curry layer, and this is such a must! I can't imagine it without the sour cream.\nI always add about 3 t of curry, since it is just so yummy and seems the perfect amount. \n\nAlso, I never add the mushrooms, as I've never heard of chicken divan w/ mushrooms.\n\nI also top this with a layer of buttered breadcrumbs and then lightly cover w/ a layer of Parmesan cheese. I think you will find the breadcrumb topping makes it so much better.\n\nThis is a family favorite by almost everyone who makes it!",

I use cream-of-mushroom instead of cream of chicken, which I think added a nice touch. I told myself I was making it a bit healthier by using fresh mushrooms, Campbell's Healthy Request soup(low fat & sodium), and Duke's Light mayo and it comes out beautifully. I don't think there's any other substitutions that can be made, though. I tried using low-fat cheese once, and it just made a yellow plastic shell that I literally peeled off the top of the casserole. I also add crushed Ritz crackers on top of it all to make a crunchy topping and I think it was an outstanding addition. (Well, that could just be my nostalgia popping up again; Mamaw thought everything was better with a crunchy topping.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, and as to the too \"saucy\" that a couple people had problems with; you're not adding water to the soup, are you? Just add the condensed soup as a base, you don't add the water. Those fresh mushrooms I've been using should be adding a lot more moisture than canned mushrooms, but it's never been soupy for me.",

Also, I cut roasted chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces (shredded doesn't sound very appetizing to me!).  It's a lovely, easy dish served with rice and a salad.

I made minimal alterations: I used one can cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken and only about 3/4 cup light mayo -- think I'll cut that down to 1/2 next time since it had no shortage of creaminess. I also used about 2/3 of an 8-oz package of fresh mushrooms -- didn't bother sauteing before hand and they were great. The water chestnuts really make it -- very nice crunch. My only really issue was that it seemed like not quite enough broccoli/chicken for a 3-quart dish... I ended up using a 2-quart dish and had sauce left over (although the dish had no lack of sauce).",
