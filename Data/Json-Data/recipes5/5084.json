I didn't marinate it, I just threw all the ingredients in the casserole dish (I lessened the wine a little for this reason).  Next time I will add tomatoes and green onions.  This is a great base recipe and it's easy to throw together with ingredients you have on hand.  It can be used on any fish, not just Mahi Mahi, even shrimp.  I also did not find it bland as other people did.   Thanks for the recipe.",

For the \"not enough flavor\" comment, you want a subtle marinade for a lighter fish like mahi-mahi.  Most fish marinades beat you over the head with the flavors, whereas this one delicately compliments the fish nicely.  A nice caper butter can help for those needing more kick.",

My 24 year old daughter said how she could taste the garlic and it was not overpowering. I did cook the fish in a skillet with olive oil and the fish had an awesome caramelization on both sides. I served it with fresh green beans that were boiled for about 5 minutes. 4 tbsp. butter in skillet and saute pecans. Add green beans and 4 tsp. zest of lemon and some fresh italian parsley. It was awesome!!  You will definitely not be disappointed with this recipe and it doesn't take a lot of time either. Bon Appetit.",
