It's crispy on the outside while the butter mixture flavors the chicken throughout but still leaves that pop of butter when you cut it open. Traditionally it is deep-fried first prior to being baked, but this recipe eliminates that step and cooks it from start to finish in the air fryer, making it a healthier and quicker alternative.",
