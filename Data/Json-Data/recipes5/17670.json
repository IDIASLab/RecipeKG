I've spent hours on some recipes and have never gotten this reaction. Here's my variation (only because I didn't have some of the ingredients): Used thighs vs. breasts b/c they absorb flavor better and I'm not particularly fond of breast. Used soy sauce substitution (didn t have soy sauce recipe below). cup honey vs. pineapple juice (didn t have on hand). Tennessee Whiskey would use 2 Tbs next time or cook a little longer to burn off alcohol. 2 Tbs brown sugar maybe a tad more. Seasoned chicken with salt and saut\u00e9ed adding a small sliced onion halfway through and cooking until chicken was no longer pink and onion soft. Added a chopped carrot and sauce mixture and brought it to a boil. Turned off heat and let it sit for 30 min (almost like a marinade) because I was waiting for hubby to get home. Cooked for 15 minutes and added cornstarch to thicken. Served over mashed potatoes - loved it! and better yet hubby loved it SOY SAUCE SUBSTITUTE 1 1/2 c. boiling water 4 tbsp. low sodium beef bouillon Pinch pepper 1 tbsp. dark molasses 4 tbsp. cider vinegar 1 tsp. sesame seed oil Combine all ingredients in a bowl stirring to blend thoroughly. Pour into jars. Cover and seal tightly. May be refrigerated indefinitely. Shake well before using. Makes 2 cups sauce",

I have to admit, when I first put it together, and \"taste tested\" it, my reaction was less then impressed.... then, I served it over rice and as I made my way through it, it seemed to get better and better... almost like an \"acquired taste\" sort of thing.  I personally added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the \"broth\" to thicken it a bit.  I will be making this one again, but think it can be much improved upon by using chunked pineapple in heavy syrup along with red and green bell peppers cut in strips.",
