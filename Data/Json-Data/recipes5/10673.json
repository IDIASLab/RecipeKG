My wife is on record as preferring twice as much as I used here, which will give you a looser but much more luxurious mixture. This also needs a good amount of salt to bring the flavors together, so taste and adjust carefully. You could certainly use other salty seasonings like soy and/or fish sauce, but you already knew that. Serve with taro, wonton, or sweet potato chips.",

We had to try this but we won't make it again.",
