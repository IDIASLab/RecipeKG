This time I will make an exception, because I think this has potential, but falls short.  Many things can make a difference in this recipe.  The spicyness and size of the meatballs used makes a huge difference.  I thnk that you should always use fresh lemon juice in a recipe like this.  The flavors between bottled and fresh are tremendous.  I think the soup could use more orzo too. I also think that this recipe should have at least one more egg.  When you make any kind of egg/lemon sauce it should be creamy.  This broth was very liquidy.  Following the recipe exactly made a very tart soup without a lot of body to it.  I will try again, but with modifications.",

We sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top too. Easy quick toss it all together and walk away! OH and I forgot to add in the egg and lemon juice!!!",

I cooked this with rice instead of orzo and used green peas (added during last 10 minutes) instead of zucchini.  Also, I added just a little bit of Greek seasoning that I had in the house.  I didn't use the eggs at all (allergic to eggs).    The best thing about the recipe is that it reheats nicely for leftovers, so my husband and I ate this for a couple of lunches later that week.
