I substituted fresh salmon that I pulsed in the food processor; (to form small chunks) used fresh bread crumbs along with a couple of tsps of Old Bay. The cakes I made were thin (like 6 oz hamburger patties) so the salmon would cook before they browned too much. I cooked them using half butter and oil. It imparts a little better flavor then oil alone. They were extremely moist!!! I've used two sauces: first I tried a dill flavored Hollandaise. Quite nice. Next I made a Brown Butter and found the nutty flavor worked great.",

They type of salmon the size of eggs butter vs margerine dry herbs vs fresh herbs fresh bread crumbs vs dry bread crumbs even the size of bread crumbs and chopped herbs. Here's what I did. Using 3 small cans of boneless skinless sockeye salmon undrained adding all 2 cups of dry bread crumbs(didn't bread them) 2 large eggs 1 tsp dried dillweed 1tbl dried parsley 1tbl dried onion powder 1tbl lemon juice 3 tbl margerine. Really work these into a patty. I browned them in a frying pan. When you drop it in the pan push it around alot so they don't stick even with oil in the pan. I finished them off in the oven on parchment paper for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. My 2.5 yr old ate these and enjoyed it. Next time I will try some sort of dill sauce for them for the adults.",
