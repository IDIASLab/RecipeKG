Rather than the packages of taco seasoning and the salt I used Penzey s Taco Seasoning in an amount they recommended for each pound of meat which actually was more than the two ounces instructed in the recipe. After the recommended cooking time the meat was tender (of course) and it was good too. But it tasted pretty much like plain roast beef! What happened to the taco seasoning flavor? This would never do so out of desperation I shredded the meat and put it back in the Crock Pot with a package of taco seasoning. I found I had to add a little water after that but so what now the meat tasted like it was meant for tacos. All and all surprisingly satisfying and delicious for so little effort and so few ingredients.",
