Here's what I did differently: I didn't have any red curry paste so I added a whole lot of cayanne also I didn't have any lemons so I just added a little more lime juice. I also didn't have any mint so I just added the mayo (Miracle Whip) and coconut together. I didn't let it mingle for an hour but the flavours of the mayo were still great. I'm looking forward to making some to freeze for our camping trip! Thanks for the terrific recipe!",
