I made it to the recipe and of course forgot to put the sauce and fresh basil on for the picture but I did make it and we spooned it on and it was fabulous! Will make again.",

We loved it and I really thought the CAULIPOWER crust held up exceptionally well and was delicious-tasting and crispy.  Two points on the recipe, next time around I might use Greek Yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Second, if you are making one, of these pizzas you might as well make two.  I really believe that the ingredients list as is can support two of these delicious pizzas.  No matter what though,  you are going to thoroughly enjoy this great Recipe!!!",
