I use about 6 lbs of chicken drumettes and then double the recipe. I also bake at 375 for about 1 hour 45 minutes making sure to baste and then let the pan sit for a few minutes after removing from the oven this seems to thicken the sauce a little more - but this is not a thick sauce - it's more of a sticky marinade just coating the wings.

Of course, I did allow it to rest for about 15 minutes, so that those juices will remain in the chicken.  \r\n\r\nMy only change was that I did not use the marinade that the chicken was soaking in while in the refrigerator for 2 hours.  I have read that you are not supposed to reuse the marinade that your chicken soaks in.  I reserved some of the marinade to cook with and poured that over the chicken while cooking.\r\n\r\nIt was not too sweet and I will try this recipe again.  It went great with the green beans and brown rice that I prepared.",
