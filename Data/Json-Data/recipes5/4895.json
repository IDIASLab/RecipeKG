I pounded three chicken breasts down thin as the recipe states but instead of just rubbing it with olive oil and using garlic salt I rubbed the chicken with olive oil and used minced garlic plus added a bit of salt and cracked black pepper. I basically eyeballed the ingredients. We also grilled the chicken with the fresh rosemary sprigs to give it a nice flavor. I kept the amount of topping the same and it was absolutely fabulous. I also used a combination of shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses sprinkled on top. I served it with a side of angel hair pasta with \"Best Marinara Sauce Yet\" from this site. All we needed to complete the meal was a fresh garden salad! Thanks Deborah for a great recipe!",

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used only two chicken breasts (one package from Costco's boneless, skinless, chicken breasts) and cut the ingredients for the topping in half.  My parmesan cheese was actually Trader Joe's Shaved Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago Cheese.   I do believe that the chicken could have used just a tad more seasoning (at least pepper), and it really did cry \"Capers!\" to me throughout my preparation.  And for sure I'd add the capers to it next time.  There certainly will be a next time.  I was just trying to stick to the recipe as stated since I knew this would be one of the first reviews.  This was very yummy!  And we WILL have this many more times in the future.",

Healthy too! Next time I will season the chicken prior to cooking but it was pretty good. I may also add some fresh oregano with the basil then it would be more like a chicken parm dish but low-fat/calories. Here I thought I was going to be the first to review this recipe as I was searching for something to do with 'chicken' and 'basil' and came across it and figured I would give it a whirl! Nice to know someone else is on the same wavelength!:) Thanks Deborah for providing the recipe! (from another Deborah!)",

I then placed the chicken on a baking pan and put the mixture and Parmesan cheese on top and baked it until slightly golden brown on top which was appx 10 minutes...PERFECT AND EASY!",

I used Italian seasonings and put Garlic powder on both sides of the chicken breast prior to cooking. I baked this in the oven. I didn't put on the mix until 15 minutes into cooking. Maybe I should have put in on earlier. My husband liked it but also complained that it didn't have much flavor. I probably will not make it again.",
