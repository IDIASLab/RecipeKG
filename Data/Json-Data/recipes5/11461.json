I did not have apples so I used the pre-packaged cups of natural chunky applesauce. It is super moist and almost too moist as it has the look and texture of dressing! I served with cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes as suggested which was a good idea. But this was just really strange and not very appetizing to me especially the next day after it was reheated.",
