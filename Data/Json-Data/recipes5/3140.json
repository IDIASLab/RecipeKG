I didnt like though that I could faintly taste the cottage cheese. I think I would prefer this with sour cream instead and that is what I will try next time. I also wanted to make it on the grill so I just marinated the fish for 1/2 hour in the lemon juice bay leaf and I added garlic. I also think the sauce would taste better with fresh herbs. BUT all in all a good starting point!!!!",

The swordfish wasn't nearly as flavorsome as I remember it being (I rarely make recipes with swordfish) and I should have known that asparagus is kinda woody this time of year. I don't know it just wasn't nearly as great as I thought it would be. Thanks anyway!",
