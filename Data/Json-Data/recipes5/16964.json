I also used Milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because they are my fiance's favorite. They turned out Great!!!! Totally easy. I made one pan and now I have to make another to give as gifts. Allow for time for the choco. chips to solidify. My fiance couldn't...they were half gone before I realized the chocolate WOULD solidify;) Thanks for the EASY tasty recipie. I will definately make these again...Tonight!",

I made them before bed and then cut them into bars the next morning after they had cooled completely. They were a bit hit at my work s Christmas party. The flakey crust sweet brown sugar/nut layer and the bittersweet chocolate are a wonderful mixture of flavors and textures. I ll be making these again very soon.",
