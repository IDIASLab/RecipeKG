This time I wanted to line the loaf pan with some of the sauce, press the meat in, and let it roast in the goodness. I was envisioning a beautiful, glossy finish when I turned it on to the serving platter. It wasn't quite as aesthetically pleasing as I hoped (ugly). But, hey--this is quick and dirty home cooking. It may not have looked good, but it tasted fine!",
