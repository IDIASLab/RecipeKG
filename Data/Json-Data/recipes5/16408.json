The only good part was the frosting (which was the sugary part that my mom couldn't eat). It was extremely dry even though it sucked up all pudding filling and it tasted like chocolate flavored baking powder. Part of me wants to make a bunch of revisions and try it again but I don't even think it's worth it. I spent so much time making and decorating this for my mom's birthday and it was so disappointing. Oh well it's the thought that counts right?",
