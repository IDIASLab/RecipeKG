The picture provided is not at all how mine lookes. However, it was very light fluffy and tasted really good ecpesially for being low-fat!! I will make this one again.***\n\n***I made this cheesecake again using light cream cheese and the light cool whip. The cheesecake came out much firmer then the non-fat kind. So if you don't mind a few more grams of fat and a few extra calories I would use the light version of each. I also switch it up with chocolate gram cracker crust and used some mini chocolate chips....yum!!!",

I added some lemon zest into the mixture to really punch up the flavor, and I found that this cheesecake tastes 100% better if you eat/serve it about one day after you make it!!! Therefore, it's a really good idea to make it the night before you plan to serve it because then the flavors will have time to mingle around with each other--I guarantee you'll taste the difference from doing so!",

You can Adjust the sweetness by adding or subtracting the amount of sugar. It's very simple and you can make this with small children too. You can create this by simply adding the fruits sauce and fresh fruits caramel and etc. It's nothing but your creativity!!",
