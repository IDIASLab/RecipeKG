Poultry seasoning sage and pepper to taste. (no salt as sausage is salty enough) Two eggs and 1/4 cup milk. For the broth we boil the neck liver gizzard and heart with 4-6 bouilion cubes. (makes a great stock). Cook in a Oven safe dish for approximately 30 min 350 degrees Make sure stuffing reaches 165 degrees. If you stuff the bird see internet for temp. regulations for health reasons.",

I used the Jimmy Dean sausage with Sage and after browning the sausage I removed it from the pan and then added the butter to the sausage drippings to cook the celery and onion mixture. I increased the sage to my personal preference and like other reviewers also added in some poultry seasoning. I also added in some garlic powder and parsley. I had halved the recipe because I was only serving 4 people but still ended up using the full cup of chicken broth as I prefer a very wet moist stuffing. I made this along side a roasted chicken so I only baked it for approximately 20 minutes at 350 degrees. I have always used Stove Top from the box for my stuffing but NEVER AGAIN! This is my new stuffing recipe and I can't wait to serve it to the family at Thanksgiving this year. I may even try it with turkey sausage the next time to cut down on some of the calories and fat. Thank you so much for sharing - a definite keeper!",
