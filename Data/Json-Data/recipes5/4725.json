I used about 10 oz of pasta subbed a 14.5 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes (drained) for 1 of the fresh tomatoes and subbed a 14.5 oz can of Italian stewed tomatoes (which I pureed) for the 8 oz of crushed tomatoes. I only used 1 Tbsp of oil total and also added in a can of mushrooms. I doubled the lemon juice added a little cracked pepper and some red pepper flakes for a kick. Not a fan of mussels so I used only shrimp about 1.5 pounds. We sprinkled fresh parm and fresh chopped basil on top. It was really easy to make flavorful and healthy!",
