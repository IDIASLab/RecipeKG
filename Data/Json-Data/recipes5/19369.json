Unfortunately, on a cold and blizzardy day in Denver I realized I didn't have any peaches so I substituted pineapple chunks.  It turned out great.  I also added 2 more eggs than called for in the recipe and the custard turned out perfect. Not too soupy at all.   Additional note:  I had some very ripe peaches that needed to be used and I was able to make this recipe as written.  Fabulous! I added 3 more eggs than called for and also used half and half.  I think the more eggs are needed in the original recipe.  Wonderful sauce too.",

I love bread pudding, and this one was just ok.  I hardly tasted any of the peaches, so that definitely needs to be increased.  Once the sauce was cooked, it didn't have a bit of rum flavor to it, so if you like rum, that will need to be increased.  The bread pudding cooked nicely and accurately, but I felt like the top sauce overwhelmed it with too much sweetness.  I should have gone sparingly instead of pouring the whole amount on top.  Overall, it tasted like typical, ordinary bread pudding.  To be more accurate to it's title, it will definitely need some modifications.",
