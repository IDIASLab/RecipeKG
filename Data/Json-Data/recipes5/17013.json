The thing that absolutely made this recipe the best was the texture - and I guess that is attributed to the oatmeal and cheese!  The only thing I did differently was put a dash of garlic powder in and use my Pampered Chef Mini-Loaf pan to do four loaves.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion for those who are finding it to be too \"wet\".  Let the oatmeal/egg/milk mixture sit for a few minutes so the oatmeal can absorb some of the liquid before you combine with the meat.\r\n\r\nYUM!  This is going to be my permanent meatloaf recipe!",

I stuck pretty close to original recipe but added Ms Dash's 1/2 tsp onion medley and cut back to 1/2 tsp salt. Also was just under 1/2 cup of oats so I added some italian bread crumbs too. Put about 1/4 cup chopped onions and had to add Worcester sauce cuz I love it! This really was easy to make and has me looking forward to the next time we can eat meatloaf! Thanks Tonya!!!",

It produces a tender and tasty meatloaf.\n\nI made the following modifications. I tripled the recipe and substituted 1 lb  of ground lamb for 1 lb of ground beef. I made one batch of mini's in a muffin tin and instead of adding the cheese into the meat I formed the ball of meatloaf around a chunk of cojack cheese. Yummy, yummy! The other two loaves I mixed the cheddar cheese into and baked them regular size. \n\nFinally, I did not add the mustard to the topping; I don't like mustard. So I added a bit of onion powder and cut back on the sugar a bit.\n\nAnyway, awesome recipe!",
