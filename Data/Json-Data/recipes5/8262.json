Setting some of the mixture aside to use as a dipping sauce is genius - it is perfectly seasoned and packed with flavor. I think the cook time for such thin cuts is a bit long at least for my grill. I cooked mine 10 minutes total and they were definitely done - any longer any they would have been dry. You also won't need a whole bunch of cilantro! I didn't need to add any water to the sauce as the consistency was to my liking as is. I'm definitely going to be making this again. I served it with rice and grilled veggies but this would make excellent chicken tacos too!",
