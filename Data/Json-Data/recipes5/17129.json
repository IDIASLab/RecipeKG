I baked this as cupcakes - they're not just ok, they're excellent, and NOT \"considering they have beer in them,\"  but maybe BECAUSE they have beer in them!  Maybe the beer is the reason they're so light, fluffy, moist and deliciously spicy.  I used Guiness Draught, and even using a heavy, robust beer such as that, it was not apparent or overkill at all.  I baked them about 20 minutes, and topped them with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting, also from this site.  It was the perfect combination.",
