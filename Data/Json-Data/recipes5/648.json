Fluffy and no weird \"healthy food\" bitter aftertaste...very convincing to the white flour and canola oil type of muffin maker.\n\nI DID adjust the recipe only a wee bit, by using cardamom instead of the cinnamon, and placing the walnuts on top as a topping rather than in the batter. This is because I am serving a 1st grader who doesn't like walnuts. It didn't peel away very easily from the paper muffin liner; maybe next time I will hit the inside of the muffin papers with some coconut oil cooking spray. Anyway, highly recommended!",
