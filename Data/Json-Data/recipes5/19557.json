I usually just eat these things cold with a bit of Splenda but this was really nice change. I used light butter and added a little nutmeg along with the cinnamon. As with anything you but in a broiler you have to watch it carefully so it doesn't burn. Everyone's oven is differnent so use the 10 minutes as a guide - it may take less time than that.",

Broiling it burnt the out of the topping so I took out the rest of the topping and the second half and tried it again baking it at 350 for 10 minutes. Came out nicely that time. It's interesting but I don't think I'd make it again. Something about the sweetness of the topping and the tartness of the fruit don't really go together all that well!",
