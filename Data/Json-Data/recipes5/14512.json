I think a lot of the success has to do with the enchilada sauce you use. That leading brand we all know...skip it. Go with an off brand imported from Mexico (typically cheaper too). I used it for years but that leading brand has a metallic twang to it that is no good. The imported brands have a flat taste to them and more depth of flavor. I chose to skip some of the topping to cut down on fat. I used red onion cilantro and cheese and that is all that I needed. Tortilla strips sour cream and avocado would have been nice but avocados are an arm and a leg and the others were unnecessary fat for me so I left them out. You really can't go wrong with this one and it would be easily adaptable to suit a vegetarian. I enjoyed this one on many levels and I know soup. Thank you!",
