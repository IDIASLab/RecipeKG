What I was picturing when I looked at the ingredients was chicken with an alfredo-y sauce on it, but I have to say it tasted very bland.  I would say the dish certainly is not worth all the fat in it.  I would rather make alfredo by itself which is much tastier.  If I did make this again I would definitely add garlic powder, and probably some other spices with it.  The recipe is a good starter but it isn't very tasty at the moment.  Sorry to be a downer!",
