Mom and I have started using A LOT more curry powder than it calls for. It's our favorite part. We don't use spicy curry... it's the regular McCormick kind that comes in the red/white can or the little plastic container with the red lid. I tried the \"fancy\" McCormick kind once and didn't like it at all. I also use Kroger brand Curry and it's the same. One of our family and friends' favorite recipes!",

I made it tonight with just a few minor changes because I did not have everything on the ingredient list. I used Fresh Broccoli I steamed first cut up a roasted chicken we had from the deli at the supermarket used half plain Greek yogurt and half mayonnaise mixed half brown rice cooked and half Texmati wild rice mix and used crushed whole wheat Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. We also used mild Cheddar instead of sharp. It came out Great!!!! Even my very picky husband liked it! We will definitely hang on to this recipe for use frequently!!!",

The chicken and broccoli layers were just that... chicken and broccoli. Why wouldn't I have just prepared rice broccoli and chicken separately and served them that way on a plate b/c this required a thorough stirring upon serving to give all the separate \"layers\" more FLAVOR. There are plenty of other similar recipes on here for the same ingredients requiring one to mix them all together so I can really only give this particular recipe a 2-3 for its method but not necessarily the taste of everything when it mixed together.",
