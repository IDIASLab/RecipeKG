Not family fave, but still good in general with modifications:\n1 tsp of basil, 1/2 tsp of thyme, 1 tbps minced onion, 2 tbps of parm cheese, 1 clove garlic, 1 cup lemon juice, pineapple juice, pepper to taste - all as marinade for 20 minutes (I did for 2 filets). For any novices like me - as fyi when I say marinade - in bag for 20 mins, sauce was not put into the oven with fish.  Only added the milk/pineapple for the oven.\n-- 2006 review below:\nI really enjoyed, but I did alter quite a bit. Didn't use measurements, but thought I would at least list what I put in...\nblack pepper, garlic, minced onion, basil, parm cheese, 1 cp lemon juice, pineapple juice.\nAll mixed in bag and marinated the fish in it for 20 mins before baking.  Added milk as directions stated, and pineapple tidbits on top.\nI really enjoyed, a lot of flavor and wasn't too much lemon.\n:-)",

Used 5 fish filets 3 mahi mahi and 2 ahi tuna. We also omitted the milk. The lemon flavor was still strong even though it was diluted by the pineapple juice and used less than the recipe called for. I can't imagine how bad it would have been if we'd followed the recipe as written. I can see why it only has 3 stars overall. I would give this recipe 4 stars with the adjustments I made. I normally at least try to make a recipe as written so I can give it a proper review but this one just seemed like a fail from the get-go. Was a good base though.",
