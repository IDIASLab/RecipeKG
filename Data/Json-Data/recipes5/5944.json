I did make 2 changes: used pecans instead of almonds (personal preference) and I accidentally used coconut milk instead of coconut cream. The texture was way too soft even after chilling overnight and we wound up having to freeze it to make it more palatable. Even frozen it didn't hold together all that well. Using cream as directed will definitely improve texture but I'm not sure by how much. Hubby felt like the yogurt taste was too strong too. I think the brand of yogurt is key to the success of this recipe both for texture and flavor. We both liked the blueberry sauce.",
