The pizza had great color and eye appeal and the flavor was good - next time I think I would add some spices to give it more kick - maybe some garlic and italian herbs. Also my sundried tomatoes were quite crispy not sure why they were charred! Nonetheless this was a very good recipe and I will probably make it again albeit with a few tweaks.",

We used Betty Crocker's Pizza Crust Mix on a 12-inch round cookie sheet and put the toppings on the uncooked dough except for the salmon (which was put in later to prevent overcooking). I would suggest more sundried tomatoes and a longer cooking time (we did 20 mins) for a crispier crust. We also use part-skim mozarella to keep it healthy-ish and that woked out great",

I brushed the pizza dough with the olive oil my homemade sundried tomatoes were packed in and pre-baked it for 5-7 minutes (we like it crispy). Then because we like our smoked salmon as is I added all the ingredients except the salmon and proceeded as directed. When the pizza was done I scattered the diced salmon over the top and served. Done this way the salmon is so rich you really don't need a full cup. Thank you MelissaReNea for an easy elegant pizza!",
