I added a more then a drop of hot sauce, gave the bottle a few good shakes.  I used three cinnamon sticks to simmer in the stew while cooking.  The biggest change was, I simmered it uncovered rather then covered.  The stew looked too watery, and I like a thicker stew.  It reduced nicely.",

It's so easy especially for people with young kids who need a meal fast or one that they can leave on the stove. Forever and always love this meal.",
