I made several changes but followed the basic idea: I used around 3 cups of uncooked rotini no oil 1 pound of lean ground beef the taco seasoning 2 cloves of garlic half a medium onion - diced 1 15-ounce can of diced tomatoes no salsa more like 3/4 cup of water the black beans and around 1 cup of shredded cheddar. Oh and I omitted the cilantro as my husband despises it. I followed step 1 then for step 2 I browned up the ground beef then added the diced onion the chopped garlic the can of tomatoes the taco seasoning and the water. I let the meat mixture cook and thicken up for around five minutes then mixed in the beans and let them warm for two minutes. I then added the drained rotini and the cheddar turned the burner off and let it all warm for a minute or two. We served it with salad ranch dressing light sour cream and shredded cheddar and Mexican blend cheeses. Taco-y beef-y and pasta-y yum! Even our four-year-old enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing Kayce!",
