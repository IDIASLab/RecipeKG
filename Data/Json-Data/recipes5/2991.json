I think the corn would have been better but the green pepper added a nice color and flavor. I also changed the prep method a bit since I had no instant brown rice on hand. Instead I just cooked regular brown rice mixed in the vegetables didn't save the drained juice and just threw all the raw ingredients together. It's a lot easier to make this way and it really tastes great. I put the rice in warm and it worked well this way...I think the warmth brought out the flavors of the vegetables and herbs. I also used fresh herbs. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's wonderful!!!",
