No green peppers tripleded up on the mustard and added maybe a 1/2 cup of pickle juice. This is I think the first time I have ever used tofu in a recipe never mind silken tofu. Of course I have eaten tofu in various dishes at Chinese/Japanese/Thai restaurants. This was while light tasting a great substitute for a mayo based salad.
