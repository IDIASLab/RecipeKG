First time I made as is and I found it needed way more citrus and less oil for my tastes (granted a \"bunch\" of carrots is pretty vague so keep that in mind)! Still super good. Next time I added red wine vinegar fresh dill and garlic... phenomenal!! Also thought it was even better the next day so making it ahead of time for a party might be a good idea. Going to try it greek style next with oregano lots of garlic and some crumbled feta...possibilities are endless!",
