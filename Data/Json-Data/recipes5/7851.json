We found that there wasn't really much flavor and had to add seasonings to the finished product. We could not taste the bacon at all or any of the other ingredients. I also found the bacon to have an unappetizing appearance since it essentially ends up \"steaming\" in the closed up foil packets and gets soggy. To note: I did add some bacon grease as suggested in the recipe notes and I cooked these on the outdoor grill. If I were to make this again I'd definitely double the bacon sauce mixture.",
