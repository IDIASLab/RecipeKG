We usually skip the whipped cream (out of laziness) but I've made this once using cinnamon whipped cream with great results. I also add some ground cloves directly to the molassas mixture instead of dusting it on top and sometimes I add a little ground nutmeg. We've used ordinary milk a few times instead of half-and-half but it's not quite as good that way -- the cream smooths out the flavours somehow.",
