I like a thin pancake so I tend to only cook half the batter at a time. I don't have a cast iron pan so I use a 9x16 glass pyrex dish instead. I heat it up in the oven (250C fan) for 20 minutes, then take out and put on the burner, heat oil, pour batter, put back in oven for 10 - 15 more minutes. Comes out perfect every time.  I also use dried rosemary and sometimes a tablespoon of chopped garlic. Stores well in the fridge for 3 days, after that, the texture becomes more chewy and not as tasty.",

I have primarily given this recipe 5 stars for that one step, which another allrecipes.com recipe left out. My results were amazing. Crispy with just a thin soft layer in between the crispy top and crunchy bottom. Salty and bursting with fresh herbs with a slight nuttiness imparted by the hydrated chickpea flour. I actually used a third to a half a cup of fresh parsley. Don't be afraid of fresh herbs. They impart so much flavour, but it's actually difficult to add so much that the flavour is overwhelming. I also only cooked it for 15 minutes at 450C. It might depend on your oven, but I would check before 25 minutes to ensure you don't end up with a burnt end product. You can also hydrate the chickpea flour overnight for an easy breakfast the next day or while you're at work so you can have it with dinner as soon as you get home. This recipe is quite flexible.",
