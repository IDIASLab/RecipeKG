It smoothed the spices a bit and made it even more moist.  I served it with a Kentucky Bourbon reduction (hard sauce) and it was fantastic.  The kids loved theirs with Cool Whip.  We'll definately make this again.",

I think I should have used less ginger and added some cloves and nutmeg. I made the cake in two loaf pans and baked them for 50 minutes. They didn't rise very much and once I cut into the cake it dried out very quickly. I frosted the cake with cream cheese frosting and that really improved it. Next time I make gingerbread I will probably try a different recipe.",
