The only adjustment I made to the recipe was simmering the figs, brown sugar, & vanilla in much more water than the two Tbsp. for about twenty minutes until it turned syrupy.  Then I refrigerated this overnight before using on the cheese the next day, letting the figs really absorb the syrup and soften.  Heavenly!",

A few thoughts - if your figs are very ripe you don't need 10 minutes to soften them. Whole toasted almonds are divine in this. And if you peel the rind off your cheese it becomes a gooey dip. Next time we'll leave the rind on so it stays a bit more in its' original form.",

But I stuck with it and reread some of the reviews to see what I needed to do to make it better. 1) Don't eat it with heavy crackers like Wasa- it messes up the flavor combination. We used Honey Butter Ritz and that was much better. 2) Next time I'll chop up the figs because they hold together too much in just quarters and it's hard to spread on a cracker without getting a huge glob of fig. 3) Be sure to cook the figs sugar water vanilla combo long enough to get it think and goopy. It needs to blend well with each other. Very exotic tasting and fancy! We had it with Salmon and Wild Rice and it was a fabulous meal!",
