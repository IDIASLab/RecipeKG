Rather than going to the extra effort of buying or making a pie crust, we just baked it in a shallow casserole dish.  The only change I made, was using ricotta cheese rather than cottage.  It's a little on the salty side, so, if watching your salt, cut back a bit on the poultry seasoning.  I used the left overs the next day in an omlette and it was amazing!  Will definately make again and again and again.  This may replace the boring green bean casserole at Thanksgiving!",

Then I added feta and instead of cottage cheese I used a dollop of creme fraiche. I let everything cook together in the pan for a couple of minutes then placed it in the casserole dish. I omitted the butter and just sprinkled breadcrumbs on top and baked it for about 10 min's. Unbelievably tasty!",
