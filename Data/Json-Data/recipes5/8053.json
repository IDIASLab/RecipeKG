                "reviewBody": "2.20.18  I made these using the original time listed: 5 minutes. Unfortunately, five minutes in an Instant Pot is too long for a soft boiled egg, you end up with a hard boiled egg.  Instead of waiting five minutes to release the pressure as written, I released the pressure instantly which they tell you to do in the Instant Pot manual. Waiting an additional five minutes  before releasing the pessure would have cooked the egg even more.  I\u2019m going to try this again tomorrow morning with three minutes, releasing pressure instantly, and if that's too runny, I\u2019ll try it at four minutes because I like the idea of Instant Pot soft boiled eggs.  All was not lost, instead of having a soft-boiled egg for breakfast, I had an egg salad sandwich for lunch.  UPDATE 11.22.18: Been meaning to do an update on this, and since we just had soft boiled eggs for Thanksgiving breakfast, thought I\u2019d sit down and do this now.   Three minutes works perfectly for a runny yolk, but firm white.  Do not wait for 5 minutes after the time is up, release pressure INSTANTLY, putting a towel over the valve, so the steam doesn\u2019t go everywhere, then quickly run the eggs under cold water until cool  enough to touch, or put them into a bowl of ice water to cool down (to stop the cooking).  And cut your toast into strips for easy dunking.",

They were super easy to peel and the yolks were completely done and very tender. If you want a soft center not fully cooked then you need to probably only cook 2 minutes release the pressure and remove them right away. Thanks anyway for a great way to make eggs!",
