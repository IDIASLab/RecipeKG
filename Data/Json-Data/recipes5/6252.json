They came out awesome and was just 35ish min total cook time ;)",

I was most wary of all of the water and really wanted to eliminate the water for more of a roasted effect but I followed the recipe (other than 1/2ing it). I used dried til (2 tsp) slightly less thyme and rosemary (just not a huge fan) and about 1/2 tsp of white pepper and 1 tsp of salt. Great flavor and great texture. They took about an hour though I did cut into about 1/2\" wedges. THANKS for the recipe!",
