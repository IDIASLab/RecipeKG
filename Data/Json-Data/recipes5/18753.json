        "description": "This traditional Dutch cookie recipe came with a mold I got 20 years ago. Speculaas is a corruption of the Latin speculum (mirror). The dough is pressed into carved molds that can be used for wall decorations.  When turned out onto the cookie sheet, the picture appears as its mirror image, hence the name.  In the Sinterklass season they are available in 2/3 cookie size to huge thick men and women up to 1 pound known as lovers. If molds are not available, roll dough to desired thickness and use gingerbread man cutter or other cutter shapes. They are great to make ahead around Christmas because they last a long time.",

I have also been to Belgium and tasted the original Speculaas made by a famous cafeteria in Bryssels. So I baked the dough in two parts. In the first part I liked the texture of the cookies baked according to this recipe. But I thought there was way too much lemon peel. One tablespoon is more than enough! In my opinion there was also too less spices! So I added 1 tsp more of each. Finally I decided to add some white sugar in addition to the brown sugar to make it more tastefull. So I liked better the second adapted part of the cookie dough.",

Nix the citron it is unnecessary to the flavor hard to find and makes the cookies more fragile due to the chunks in an already crumbly dough. I diced the almonds as small as I could by hand will probably blend them next time instead as I prefer these cookies to be smooth. I don't have a mold so I rolled these very very thin 1/4 inch or thinner and used a cookie cutter. A star cutter didn't work as the points kept falling off. A bell worked well as did a standard circle. I baked them two minutes longer than suggested to get an extra crunchy finish. They are lightly sweet and good with hot herbal tea.",
