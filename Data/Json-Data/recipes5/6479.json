I rendered the fat off the skin in a skillet before baking, as I didn't want all the fat in the pan.(add the thighs skin side down in a cold skillet, turned to medium heat and cooked for 5 minutes until the skin was brown and the pan is filled with fat) I only used one Tablespoon of Greek seasoning for all the other herbs called for as I thought 6 Tablespoons would be way too much! 1 tsp. of pepper, a tsp. of garlic powder and the zest of a lemon. This cooked up in 40 minutes total. My store had no fresh green beans so I left them out this time, and served it with Greek salad, pita bread and tzatziki sauce! Yum! :)",

I made it as stated except found \"Greek Seasoning\" instead of Lemon Herb and used chicken breasts (family preference). Everything else was followed to the T... It was succulent, tasty, the smell was out of this world. The green beans were perfect in 15 mins and the chicken was moist. I will make this again and again. I also think it could be amazing served cold the next day on a greek or green salad, except it was demolished and I need to plan ahead to have leftovers!",
