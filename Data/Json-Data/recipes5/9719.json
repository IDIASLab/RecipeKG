Instead of the additional french onions on the top I used some bread crumbs and added them the last five minutes of cooking as directed. I used maybe 1/3 cup. I just trimmed and steamed the broccoli by placing it in a bowl with a bit of water and cling wrap over the top for 3 min in the microwave. Does the same thing as a steamer insert. I'll use more broccoli next time as I don't think 2 c. is enough for my taste.",

The only substitutions I made were to cook the quinoa in chicken stock (as I usually do) and I topped with bread crumb topping for the last 5 minutes of baking instead of more onions. This is one of those \"flexible\" recipes.....easy to add your favourite veggies and spices. Will definitely be making this again but will add 2-3 large cloves of garlic (chopped) next time. We are meat eaters in this house so this is a side dish for us but it could easily be made into a one pot meal by adding shredded cooked chicken. I gave it 4 stars because it needs garlic the kids weren't too fond of it (but to be fair this recipe is very similar to the rice version which they don't like) and because the presentation is well \"looks like slop\" my husband said. But its yummy slop!",
