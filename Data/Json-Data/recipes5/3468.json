I think I probably use more wine (don't really measure anymore) and boil it hard for awhile. The recipe is great as is but is also very flexible. If you don't feel like zesting just use juice. Not in the mood for dill? Don't use it. Note on the dill: I tend to use dried just because it's what's on hand. If you use dry you do have to decrease the amount - dried herbs are more concentrated than fresh.",

I would recommend grilling or BBQing to get that nice crisp out coating and leaving off the flour completely. Then adding the scallops back into the wine/lemon reduction.
