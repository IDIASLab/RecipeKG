MAKE THIS!!  It's so very good.  These are just some things I have done that make this recipe most versatile!\r\n",

Along with the fresh chives, I also added fresh basil, parsley, and minced garlic to the cream cheese. Before rolling up the chicken, which I sprinkled with salt and pepper, I layered a few fresh baby spinach leaves on top of the now herbed cream cheese. As others did, I partially cooked the bacon. As for the sauce, I eliminated the lemon juice, substituted white wine for 1/4 cup of the milk, and added some sauteed fresh mushrooms. The chicken was fabulous-tender with a burst of flavor and color from the herbed cream cheese and fresh spinach. The sauce was rich and creamy, the wine giving a depth of flavor to what might have been a bland sauce otherwise. Before serving I sprinkled it with some chopped, fresh parsley to give it a little color and served it with mushroom risotto. Absolutely delicious. Thanks for the recipe!",

I had no chives, so I substituted finely chopped onion, and we don't eat mayo, so whipped up a quick and easy home-made mayo recipe (not bad).  I used two bacon strips per serving and pre-cooked the bacon-wrapped chicken for about 20 minutes, then added the sauce.  This is my new favorite dish. My husband is difficult to impress food-wise, and rarely makes unsolicited comments.  If he doesn't like it, he doesn't eat it; it's edible if he clears his plate; he really likes it if he goes for seconds.  He actually said it was very good, quizzed me about how it was made, and went for seconds.  I made it again for our anniversary, and had to defend my own plate!  Culinary success!!!",

I did change a few things just because I was in an inventive mood. I did use sour cream instead of the mayo. I also browned the chicken for a bit so that it would not have too cook as long. Added some garlic to the sauce (love the stuff). I omitted the chives...forgot about them actually. The biggest change was that I used pancetta instead of regular bacon. I love the taste and it made this already rich dish seem like gourmet food that would cost a pretty penny in a resaurant. Amazing Anna...thank you.",
