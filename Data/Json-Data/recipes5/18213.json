I am 31 years old and have never been able to make a edible muffin, they are usually tough from too much stirring or tasteless or fall apart, etc. This recipe is perfect for people like me, it is easy and my favorite - adaptable. I like to experiment with different ingredients, especially types of flours and this it the one that I can use. I made the muffins last night, using a heaping cup of fresh pumpkin puree and 2 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I upped the raisins as well and left out the walnuts. Filled cups level to top as another reviewer suggested and they turned out very good, my three year old son loved them. I made another batch right away and used 1 cup of whl. wht. flour and half a cup oat flour, used chocolate chips instead of raisins and no walnuts.Again another heaping cup of fresh pumpkin and two tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a heaping 1/4 tsp ginger. Turned out perfect. I can not wait to try this recipe with barley flour. Oh another hint that helped me alot was to stir the batter with a rubber spatula instead of a spoon and to fold the ingredients not stir! Thank you for helping me fix my \"muffin mistakes\".\n\nWould just like to add that I have made another batch of muffins a few days later, only I substituded fresh mashed pears for the pumpkin - even better with this friut! I had to bake longer than recipe called for.",

Well after baking them for 18 min. they were still not done so I added another 6 min. then they were done. I buttered one up and took a bite and was totally disapointed! They were extremely bland and had this dry 'wheat' bread taste. Not a moist and pumpkin-flavored muffin like I was expecting. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone. I'm sorry but it's quite terrible! YUCK",

You can get 12 muffins out of one batch but I like to double it and use the bigger can of pumpkin puree. Also if you fill the cups right up to the edge (batter is a little stiff) then it mounds up to look like a perfect little muffin. I also tried to make a loaf out of this and it didn't work so good. Will stick with the muffins. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!",

This recipe was so easy that my 2 year old daughter was able to help me with it and she and I devoured them afterwards. I loved the idea of soaking the raisins to make thm softer too it really added a nice texture. Again I made only a few changes out of necessity. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg b/c I didn't have the pumpkin pie spice and I used spelt flour and pecans b/c that's what I had on hand. But the recipe is so easy that I decided to make 3 more batches and give them to neighbors as gifts! Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe!",
