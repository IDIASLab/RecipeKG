I have to echo the hesitation about the cheddar cheese, but I used less than was suggested and it really just added to the consistency, though I didn't taste much in the flavor. I used dried cranberries and honey instead of the brown sugar. Scooped out the majority of the squash and mixed with the apple mixture, just for ease. Was very happy with the result, even my friend who really doesn't like cheese was happy with it. Yummy vegetarian meal!",

Cut in half, seeded, 1.5 inches of water in a bowl and placed it cut side down.  Used a fork and poked the skin a bit and 15-20 in the microwave.  While it was cooking I prepped the rest and turned on the oven to 350.  Once completed almost all the water had either absorbed or evaporated.  I stuffed it and put it in the oven so that the cheese would melt.  I saw some people mentioning that they were skeptical of the cheese, but it makes the dish gooey.  Delicious!",
