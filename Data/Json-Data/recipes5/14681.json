Also, you need to add some oil to the pot in order to get the seasoned floured meat to sear (brown). I used about 2 tablespoons of olive oil. My husband thought it was a bit too \"herby\", so I'd cut down on the Italian seasoning a bit next time. Overall, a tasty recipe that we enjoyed.",

Also I like a lot of potatoes and peeled and chopped 3 large baking potatoes.  Otherwise I followed the ingredients as suggested.  I also used olive oil to brown the meat and saute the vegetables before adding beef stock. Plus I added peas and pearl onions just because i like them..  The meat was tender and the stew had a rich hearty flavor.  This is my new favorite recipe for stew.",
