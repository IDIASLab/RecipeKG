I also serve it with bowls of condiments: lettuce diced tomato chopped red or green onion sour cream salsa or pico de gallo Mexican rice refried or Borracho beans. I also buy my pico de gallo and flour tortillas fresh off the grill from a local Mexican restaurant. Yummy dinner that is liked by the whole family!",

Like the poster before me I also used frozen corn instead of canned to reduce sodium. I also replaced the ground beef with ground turkey to reduce fat. I've made them twice: the first time with uncooked instant white rice and the next time with some mexican rice I'd made the day before and both were delicious. Next time I may try to throw in some black beans and maybe some chopped onion-- like another posted suggested there really is so much that you can add/change to this and it'll probably still work!
