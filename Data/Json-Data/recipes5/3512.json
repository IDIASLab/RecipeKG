That said I made this recipe when I needed to bring something to a cookout and I found tomatoes on sale. I followed the recipe exactly as written BUT I left out the shrimp. (some people are allergic to shellfish and I didn't want to have to post warnings about my contribution to the table especially when the ingredients are not obvious) It was a hit. They were tasty refreshing little morsels to pop in your mouth. Next time I will try it with a little finely chopped onion or scallions and of course shrimp. Nice recipe DeltaQueen 50. To the reviewer below. I cleaned the tomatoes and made the cheese filling the night before. Next day construction was a breeze. You have the right idea about the greens for a \"bed to nest\" the tomatoes on. Next time try to julienne or finely shred a few lettuce/romaine/cabbage leaves to make a \"fluffier bed\" for them to nest upon",

I'll probably forego the tomatoes next time & just do the crackers w/ dip. It was GREAT! I put all the dip into a large ziploc bag to sit in the fridge overnight. The next day I arranged my tomatoes snipped the corner off the bag & piped as normal. Easy clean up!;) Thanks Delta Queen!",

Seriously - I left out the salt/pepper and instead added 1 Tablespoon of Old Bay Seasoning and it was fantastic!! Im sure you could use some Creole seasoning as well but the Old Bay really tied the flavors together and made it salty enough so that no extra salt was needed. I highly recommend it! Good Luck.",
