It had a slightly sweet taste that was very nice. This is not overpowering by any means. My son who puts worcestershire sauce on everything actually poured more of the marinade on his plate and didn't use the worc. sauce! The butter hardened so I am not sure if I did something wrong or not? I think the soda may have been too cold when I began. I served this with au gratin potatoes, green beans and crescent rolls for Sunday after church lunch. Not sure I would die for this marinade but perhaps I would incur a small injury ;-)",
