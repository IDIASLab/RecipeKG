Next time I am going to try white wine which will make a nicer looking sauce - the red wine and the mustard make it muddy looking.",

To have them on the sweeter side, feel free to add more of the brown sugar. It is up to you and it's a matter of taste. To mine I add a teaspoon or less of the sugar and they have always been a hit. Then if you'd like to have your mushrooms softer, wait and add the sauce after they have become browner. If you'd like them firmer at the end, then add the sauce as they begin to brown but are still somewhat firm. Normally, I continue to cook them in the skillet over medium heat for another 10mins after adding the sauce. They are great as a side to chicken or pork.",

It cooks down to a lovely thick state, \"nasty looking\" according to the original, but absolutely wonderful on toasts at a party. Try using tamari as a sub for Worcestershire (as my friend who gave me this years ago advised.)",
