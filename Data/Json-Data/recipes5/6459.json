I used about equal parts of tomato and cucumber since I didn't have 4 cucumbers.  I thought 2 cucumbers was a good ratio.  I also used half the black pepper (personal preference) and 1.5 tsp salt instead of 1 tbsp (that seemed like a lot!).  It was plenty salty with the reduced salt. I also don't think 1/2 cup of oil is necessary. Start with 1/4 cup and decide if you'd like more.  This salad creates a lot of liquid after it sits for a while.  I loved the hint of lemon and the parsley/mint combination. I'll be making this one again! With the tweaks I made, it's def a 5 star recipe.",

I did not use garlic or onion since my guests do not eat either (but I love both). I also added an avocado sliced which was a nice addition to  make up for not using the onion. And also cut the oil to 1/4 cu as well. I will make this again with all the ingredients.  Thanks for this tasty recipe!",

Once the lemon (I used 1 1/2 lemons) incorporates with the tomato and cucumber juices it really makes a difference. In my experience with cold salads they all taste so much more amazing each day afterward because it has time to suck up all the juices and marinate within itself. yum! Definitely recommend this as a healthy meal alone for those watching their weight or as a perfect summer side dish with some Swai fish fillets broiled or grilled in a lemon pepper marinade.",
