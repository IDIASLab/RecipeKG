I did not measure with great accuracy - just threw everything in a saucpan before I started to mix it all up.  I let it cook for about a minute after it started to boil, and then baked it per the directions.  If did not spill over, or burn. It came out of the oven hot and bubbling, and semi-firm. It set as it cooled...and was fantastic!!!  Incredibly rich and sweet.",

If you are having problems with the pie setting, make sure you don't just \"bring to a boil\" as the recipe states - make sure it is a good boil (as in more than 1 or 2 bubbles!). Make sure you stir constantly and you will notice the mixture thickens to almost a pudding consistency and gets a little darker as it begins to boil. I baked it for 10 mins @ 400 on bottom rack, then moved to top rack at 350 for 20 mins. Other than that, followed recipe to a tee. I love the crispy top! =] Manifique!",

It's fantastic topped with vanilla ice cream--or accompanied by a tall glass of water: it's SO RICH it almost chokes you. It's easy to prepare and impressive to guests but it does take a while to firm once it's out of the oven... after cooling for 20-30 minutes on the stove it was still far too liquid so I put it in the refrigerator and it took another half hour even then. So go ahead and make this but bake ahead of time and let it set a good long while.",
