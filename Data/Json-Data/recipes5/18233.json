Instead of pouring the candy over the pretzels next time I'm going to try dumping the pretzels in the candy then spreading them out on the baking sheet. It was hard to get them evenly coated quick enough for the candy not to set. Once they're in the oven you do have a chance to fix some mistakes when you stir them but it definitely firms up quickly. I think I took my candy a few degrees too far but they turned out nice and salty sweet. I made half a batch and it more than filled a cookie sheet so if you make the full batch you might want to prepare two sheets for your pretzels.",
