The dressing was on the thin side but had a nice taste. The meat and dressing would make much better grilled sandwiches. Ritz crackers have a very distinct taste and are heavy tasting that seem to over-power many of these oderbs. Maybe with a different style of Ritz possibly. I also thought it badly needed some swiss cheese to give it that deli sandwich taste to me.",
