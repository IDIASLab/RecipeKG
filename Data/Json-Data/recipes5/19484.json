This fit the bill, and I also like that it uses all oatmeal and no flour.  Considering how easy and fast it was, I figured if it was tasty at all it would be a keeper.  But when I bit into it--wow!  It was delicious!  It's now one of my favorite desserts.  The kids liked it too.  Very sweet and chewy.  I almost wish I didn't find this recipe, because I can see it contributing to the spread of my waistline!  These are the minor changes I made.  I doubled the recipe and added a pinch of salt and a little cinnamon. I omitted the almonds and put it in a well-greased 9\"x13\" pan and baked for about 25 minutes.  To make this recipe a little healthier, like for a breakfast bar, I might leave the chocolate chips off next time, throw in some raisins and perhaps substitute some honey for the brown sugar.  I could probably reduce the sugar to about 3/4 cup and it would still be plenty sweet.  (Edited to add:  If you find the bars too crumbly, boil the butter/sugar mixture for about a minute before adding the oatmeal.)",
