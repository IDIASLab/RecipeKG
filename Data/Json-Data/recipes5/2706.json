Now I know & will definately try again:)",

I used regular potatoes, doubled the sauce using light velveeta instead of the cheddar and adding a little more milk to thin it out a bit, garlic powder and seasoned salt to taste. I layered the potatoes (which I peeled), some cheese sauce, finely chopped onion, some shredded cheddar and a little blue cheese and then repeated the layers. LOVED the buttered cracker topping! This was a huge hit w/ me and my hubby! These will be made over and over! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Reduce the cracker crumbs--as written this recipe fits in an 8x8 and you'll never get a cup and a half of crackers spread over that unless you like a really really thick layer of crust on top. (1 cup is sufficient for a 9x13 pan!) Personally I skipped the precooking step--Yukon gold potatoes will cook to done from totally raw in an hour in recipes like this. (I did 40 mins at 350 and 20 mins at 400 because I had to put another dish in.) Thanks for the recipe I rather liked the addition of dry mustard gave it a sort of a tangy bite that we enjoyed.",
