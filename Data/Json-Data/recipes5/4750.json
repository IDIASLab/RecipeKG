We buy turkeys in November when they're on sale keep them in the stand up freezer and then grill throughout the year for a healthy meat that doesn't heat up the house. Some portion of every turkey gets made into this salad. Sometimes I use the sunflower/raisin combo and other times the pecan/cranberry. Both work well; just depends what is on sale at the time. Great with my husband's homemade rosemary raisin bread. Keeps well for the next day too.",
