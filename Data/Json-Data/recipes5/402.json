Before it was completely cooked it was very thick and borderline gummy for a lack of a better word so I did add more water which solved that problem. I thought the curry flavor was spot on and not overpowering as curry often can be. We eat a lot of rice side dishes so this will be a nice option. Certainly was simple to make.",
