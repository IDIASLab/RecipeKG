I have covered the batter with seeds(sunflower, sesame  and poppy seed) and used for an open face sloppy joe.  I really wanted something sweet so I added a non-sugar sweetener (monk fruit) and a little vanilla and it was as good as any regular muffin.  Next I plan  on doing it with lemon and poppy seeds and may try with garlic butter. I have also thought this could be used as croutons on a salad (which I really miss!).  I I am not even doing a keto diet-I just wanted to cut back on grains and I do not miss breads at all.  You have to be careful not to over cook (mine usually is  done in less than 90 sec) and it takes less time than making toast or frying an egg and so much healthier. And don't be afraid to really mix the batter well. ( I use a small whisk).  Unlike grain flours that need to be handled gently so the gluten will form, you can just beat the heck out of almond flour.  I find I get different textures depending on how well I mix.  The longer I mix, the more cake-like texture I get.",

It definitely did not taste like regular bread, but the texture was just like it. In terms of taste, to me, it was more like a corn-bread (a bit more dry than regular bread). After making it (and being amazed at how it changed from a runny glob to something spongey), I sliced it up and popped the slices in the toaster. Added butter on one piece (was still kind of dry), but added cream cheese to another one. Not bad at all! Definitely helps if you're wanting \"toast\"",
