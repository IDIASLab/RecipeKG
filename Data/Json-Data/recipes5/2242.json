I used an entire recipe of this spice in approximately 1 lb of pork and will be wrapping small amounts of it in phyllo and baking until crisp. The filling so far is great - slightly floral nicely spiced and balanced by the cloves pepper and cinnamon. I would make this again to accompany pork or even lamb - delicious! Edit: everyone loved the pork bundles! I had cooked the pork a little lean so the appetizers were served with a tamarind sauce. With or without the sauce the hors d'oevres were great.",
