I did soak the raisins and I'm glad I did. I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour to sneak some fiber into the kids diet. To compensate for the nutty flavour of the whole wheat flour, I increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons.  A number of people stated that the muffins were too salty and too oily. Keeping this in mind I referred to my favourite banana muffin recipe which is also based on two cups of flour.  It used only 1/3 cup of fat so I reduced the oil to one third cup and added 2/3 cup of thick homemade (unsweetened) pear sauce. To fix the \"too salty\" I reduced the baking powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons and the baking soda to 1 teaspoon and the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  The muffins still were nice and high.  In place of 4 eggs I used 2 eggs plus 4 egg whites.  With these changes I made 36 mini muffins which I quite liked. They are a little shy on their own but as part of breakfast with fruit yogurt the sugar was not missed by the kids. Next time I'll sprinkle the tops with brown sugar and cinnamon before baking.",
