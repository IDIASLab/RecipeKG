I used Beau Monde seasoning instead of celery salt (I don't have celery salt on hand) and garlic POWDER instead of garlic salt. This was good but a little TOO salty. Next time I'll cut back on or cut out the seasoning salt all together. NOTE: If you bake this at 275 you shouldn't have an issue with burning if you stir the mix in the pan every fifteen minutes. Setting a timer to go off every fifteen minutes helps. Sometimes it won't need the whole time the recipe asks for it might be done sooner.",
