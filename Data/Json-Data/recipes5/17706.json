I did have to bake for about 12-13 min but I think that is because I made the cookies a little on the large side as I ended up with 22 instead of the 30 the recipe said. I did end up using about 3/4 c. choc. chips since my boyfriend is a choc-o-holic. These are super tasty. A nice moist chewey cookie!! I will definately make again!",
