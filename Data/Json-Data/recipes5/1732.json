Kale buds, also called kale florets or kale raab, have started to show up at farmers' markets so snap them up when you can. Note that you can also use the buds of collard greens, they are a little sweeter in flavor than kale buds. The flowers are edible too so if your kale buds have any flowers attached, you can use those as a garnish. Sprinkle kale flowers on top if desired.",
