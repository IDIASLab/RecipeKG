Mixed everything together adding grated cheese and breadcrumbs. The stuffing was amazing! Stuff peppers and bake in oven at 350 for 45 min.          Also found a zucchini in the fridge. Very delicious!!!! A must try very easy and quick",

Still only used half the stuffing mix. I made 4 large meat balls with the remaining, boiled them in beef broth, then drained and put in the fridge. I also saved remaining pan drippings. Two days later, I skimmed fat off the pan drippings, poured it over the meatballs, and heated in covered dish in the oven. Served on egg noodles (tossed with butter & basil after cooking). Yummy again. Will add a little pork sausage next time, as suggested.",

I wish I could find a way to thicken the sauce but it's just the way it goes; expect a brothier sauce with some fat from the beef. However this my go-to and only stuffed pepper recipe. Thanks again years later. / Had leftover jasmine rice and have been wanting to make stuffed peppers for a while. I never used a recipe before for stuffed peppers but this is going in the book. I love everything about it. I scaled to 4 servings and for the \"chunky tomato sauce\" combined 8oz. can of tomato sauce and a 15 oz. can of drained diced tomatoes. Also used ground sirloin and red peppers. Followed the directions. Easy to put together and baked it for 90 minutes. All I can say is delicious!!! Have passed on the recipe to my siblings before even finishing my dinner. THANKS!",

I made it as written except for slightly less salt. It was excellent! In the past I have made these where you blanch the peppers first and brown the ground beef. I thought this was so much easier even though it does take longer in the oven. The garlic and parmesan cheese gave the dish a wonderful flavor. I'm looking forward to making with half sausage half ground beef next time. The only thing was that I had to cook it longer than the recipe states. My peppers were large and I have a gas oven which always tends to take longer. I even bumped the temperature up a bit for the first half hour but it still took just shy of two hours.
