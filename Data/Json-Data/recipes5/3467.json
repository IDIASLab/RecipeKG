My brain is still not quite grasping the broccoli with the peaches so maybe there is another vegetable that would go more smoothly (asparagus?) but the flavor of this was great - and it wasn't as jarring as you might suspect. I used frozen peaches and half a bottle of peach nectar because I prefer the frozen to canned - I also think the peach nectar might have given this a more peachy flavor than the syrup from canned peaches would have. I used a bag of stir-fry vegetables with broccoli carrots and snow peas which made this recipe even easier. My only suggestion would be to add the flour in the frying process rather than waiting until the end so you don't get a raw flour taste to the sauce. I also added red pepper flakes for some heat. Nice! Thanks for the recipe!",
