I used fresh cranberries rather than dried as they are in season and so good for you! I also sauteed a small onion and garlic to add to the mix. As far as seasonings go I mixed the olive oil lemon salt and pepper per the recipe and then added a little honey for sweetener and some fresh sage from my home herb garden. To finish I threw in some fresh chopped parsley also. This recipe is awesome because you can really mix and match what is in your cabinets and make it work regardless. The last thing I'll add is that quinoa always takes a bit longer to cook than the package says. It's usually ready for me in 20 minutes not the indicated 6 or 7 minutes.",

I did let mine sit overnight and had it for lunch the next day - it is SO much better if you let the flavours sit and develop. Next time I make it I may add grated carrots or chopped apples (as others have mentioned). I used red quinoa (love the stuff!) and aside from being SO healthy it looks darn good too! I will take a pic and upload as this is one of those 'faceless' recipes that needs a pic to be appreciated!",
