I was a little nervous about making this as I have never cooked flank steak before so I made sure to marinate it for as long as I could to ensure it would be juicy and tender (48 hours to be exact!). Instead of grilling I broiled it in the oven for 4 minutes on each side then seared it on a frying pan to get a nice crust (for about a minute in total). I also put the marinade into a saucepan and boiled it then poured a bit over the steak while it was broiling and then poured some more over it when it was ready. It turned out absolutely amazing - my husband just loved it and I have deemed it good enough to serve this Sunday at our family dinner!",

Here's a tip I discovered about 7 years ago....when flank steak is on sale, buy several and freeze in the marinade.  All you have to do is pull one out an the 24 or so hours it takes to defrost in the fridge makes it tender and moist at grilling time.  The rarer it is, the better it is.  And cold the next day is heaven!",

I just poked at the steak repeatedly with the tip of my knife along the grain all over the steak so it wouldn't affect presentation.  Like anything its good to practice this recipe before trying it out with the crowd you aim to please but it went well on the first time around marinated for about 10 hours.",
