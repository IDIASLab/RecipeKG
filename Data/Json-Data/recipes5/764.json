I sprayed my shallow pan with olive oil which helped with the sauce burning the pan since the first reviewer mentioned the sugar burn. It still requires some soaking; I'm not a fan of cooking with aluminum foil. I cooked in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 minutes. Perfect! Chicken was tasty and moist. This will go on my rotation. Thanks for an easy, flavorful recipe",

It turned out amazing! Do bote that the tecipe is for one chicken breast. We doubled it for my husband & I each having one chicken breast.  Would recommend putting some tin foil on the bottom of your dish. I think we\u2019ll be soaking that dish for days to get the burnt sauce off of it. The chicken was not burnt at all and super moist & delicious. I think it\u2019s just the sugars from the syrup?. We did reduce the heat to 400 and cooked it for 25+ minutes. It was so delicious, we have already been thinking about what we will pair with it next & we just got done eating!",
