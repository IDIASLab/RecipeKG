There is no purpose to baking the sheets of seaweed until slightly crisp since dry seaweed is already crisp. Just use the seaweek \"as is\" from the package and it will work fine. In addition to the cucumber you can use a yellow picked radish called dan mu ji (which you can easily find at any Asian grocery store but if you can't find this pickles are a good substitute). This ingredient is what gives the most flavor to the kim bap (seaweed rice) as it it traditionally called. If you don't add vinegar to the rice you can mix the already cooked rice with sesame oil and soy sauce to make it sticky. Finally you really should roll these with a bamboo mat (they're really cheap and can be bought at most grocery stores in the international food section) to get them really tight so they won't fall apart. These are one of my favorite things to eat but my husband hates them so we don't get many chances to make them.",

She uses spinach instead of chard and seasons the rice with sesame oil and salt and sometimes vinegar, depending on her mood. The seaweed (Gheem) is sometimes placed over the burner to make them more green and crispy. They were rolled like \"California Rolls\". She also added a yellow colored radish called \"Da Kuan\" which were cut into strips. I will post a picture soon. Thank you again!!",

I particularly do not like the pickled radish, because it is such a strong flavor.  I have put in carrots and beef.  I use spinach instead of the chard as well.  I do not bake the seaweed (Kim), and I do not use it directly from the package.  I find it not crispy rather more chewy that way.  I like to brush a little sesame oil on the leaves and just heat is over a burner until it's cripy, but not too crispy so you wouldn't be able to roll it.  Also, the bamboo mat is a must have tool when making kim bap. This is a favorite dish for my 9 year old.",

I'm half Korean and this is exactly how my mom would make it except for some of the ingredients and baking the sea weed sheets. My mom and her friends would trade off making Kim-bab because it is time consuming to make and they all made it differently. They usually make 25-50 rolls at a time and made it an all day event talking away in the kitchen sometimes. You can change up some of the ingredients or use the ingredients in this recipe as well. Mom usually uses cucumber fish cake spinach carrots eggs pickled radish AND SPAM. Most people never think of spam to go in this but it's great and you would never know spam is there. Some of her friends used hotdog Bul-gogi or imitation crab as well. You don't have to use the pickled radish but it really does add to the recipe and flavor. For some though it's an acquired taste. Instead of the Chard leaves you can substitute spinach and drizzle sesame oil salt pepper sesame seed garlic powder to season it. I don't care for when she makes the rice with vinegar but instead drizzle sesame oil and sprinkle sesame seeds and fold the rice. With the remaining pickled radish you can add cucumbers splashed with vinegar a little sugar and red pepper flakes and make a pickled radish kim-chi to eat with your Kim-bab.",
