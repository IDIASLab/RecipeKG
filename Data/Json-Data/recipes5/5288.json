Use my knife and plunged it into the meat on the fat side to allow the rub to penetrate more. Use my BGE and brought it up to about 280 degrees. Put the brisket on the fat side down for 45 minutes then turned it over and gave it 45 minutes on the lean side down. While it was cooking I made a huge foil waterproof \"oven\" with Super Strength aluminum foil then poured the liquid over the brisket. Wrapped it up several times to capture all of the steam and put it on the BGE for about 6-1/2 hours with temp around 230-240. Removed from BGE and wrapped the entire brisket in towels then put it in a cooler for about an hour so I could finish making our side dishes. My guest and my wife were very impressed with the flavor and how juicy and tender the brisket was! Thanks Chef Frank for the rub recipe!",
