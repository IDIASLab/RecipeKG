Instead, I made the roux in the frying pan, and while I was doing that, I sauteed the mushrooms seperately. Then I added them to the roux (thickened butter/flour mixture), along with the half & half, wine, etc., and let that reduce a little while I sauteed the scallops, adding one small garlic clove to the scallops when they were almost done. The sauce was a little too thick, so I added addt'l wine and lemon juice to thin it out a little, and then added the scallops to the cream mixture. I served them over angel hair pasta, along w/fresh asparagus and a warmed baguette. It was very good, but I wished I had some chicken broth to thin it out and lighten the sauce a little. (I don't like heavy cream sauces, so it might be perfect for someone who does.)Next time, I will reduce the half & half to 1/4 cup, and use 1/4 cup chicken broth, having more on hand to add if needed. Also, I didn't add in the bay leaf.",

I used sliced baby bella mushrooms instead of from a can; I didn't use the egg because the sauce was already thick enough and it was fine without it. I also let it simmer altogether with the milk instead of adding it later. I served it over pasta and enjoyed every single bite. Definitely will make this again.",

Unlike sea scallops bay scallops are small (about the size of a dime) and this recipe calls for a total of 11 minutes cooking time at high. With the price of scallops I was not about to risk ending up with something overcooked and inedible. I cooked this on the stovetop and it still was very quick and I used freshly-sliced mushrooms rather than canned. I served over a bed of angel hair pasta and the flavor was pretty good. I could see grating some freshly-grated parmesan over the top making it even better.",
