My friends actually encourage me to bring the paper products and the potato chips to pot luck meals.  (It is an unspoken and widely felt, \"Please don't bring anything that you cooked.\")\n\nI tell you all of this, so you'll know that *I mean it* when I say that this dish is easy and delicious.  It is worth the scant amount of effort required, and it is fool-proof.  (The hardest part is paying for the leeks at my local grocer, Whole Paycheck.)  This recipe is so good and so easy that I'm tempted to take it to the next pot-luck, so I can bask in the compliments that I am sure to receive.\n\nWe ate this with Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken [recipe from this site, plus added chicken broth to the basting juice per the advice of a helpful reviewer] and Barley cooked in Chicken Broth.  The citrus in the chicken worked well with this rich leek dish.\n\nWatch the video:  it will help!  Chef John's videos are fun to watch, and he has lots of great advice.",

Used prosciutto (store didn't have any pancetta) used the parmesan in the green can (don't particularly care for parmigiano-reggiano) and 1 cup of broth instead of 1/4 cup by mistake.
