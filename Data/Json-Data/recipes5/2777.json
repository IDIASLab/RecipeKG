I serve this dish with rice and a spinach salad with tomato wedges, hard boiled eggs, cucumber slices, feta cheese and black olives. Doubling the marinade will provide plenty of sauce to go over the rice.",

First time I did include the vege oil and the vinegar and forgot it the second time. I prefer it without but that's just me:) I am not very good with rice - it kept turning up dry but if I can figure out how to keep it moist then I am sure I'l like this dish even more. Meanwhile it might be good to try it buttered noodles or something. In any case this is a definite keeper. I love it and will make again.",

Luckily I sampled the sauce before I marinated the chicken in it so I took some liberties and added a bit more yogurt one teaspoon of sugar and a handful (1/2 c maybe??) of shredded coconut to the mix and that toned down the bitterness of it. Even still my family found the dish too spicy and didn't eat much of it. I did not read the reviews ahead of time like I usually do. I definitely think a different combination of spices would have worked better.",
