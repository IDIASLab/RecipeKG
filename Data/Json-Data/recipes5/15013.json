Because of the richness I have never made this for a dinner but always at a gathering. You could reduce the butter to 1 1/2 sticks with success, but why do it? It's really good this way. I have seen a couple other chicken casseroles using crackers, but none with all of these ingredients which really make this special. It looks really creamy, but it turns out great.",
