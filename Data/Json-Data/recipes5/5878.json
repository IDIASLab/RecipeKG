I also add some garlic 1 or 2 cloves, minced). Yum.      mini  from Fl.",

The barley is a welcome change to the usual rice or noodles used in chicken soup.  What makes it a 5 star for me is you can easily make minor modifications to suit your own personal tastes using available ingredients that don't totally change the basic recipe. I did use store bought chicken stock to save time.  I used boneless chicken breasts, cubed and browned in my soup pot briefly in 1T olive oil, added the veggies, including sliced fresh mushrooms & some minced garlic, and saut\u00e9ed everything for about 5 minutes, then added the broth and the rest of the ingredients and simmered as directed. The recipe seasonings were perfect for us. Fifteen minutes before it was done, I added about 1 c. of coarsely chopped fresh baby spinach leaves with the stems removed. Served it with warm, crusty bread and a green salad. Everyone loved it.  Some family members added freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Leftovers were lunch the next day.",

Raw veggies are hard to take all the time, but the cooked celery will be my \"nibblers\" in the evening.\nBarley has been proven to be nearly as good for heart as oatmeal, so extra bonus.  Rice or noodles spike my blood sugar, barley does not.\nThis recipe is award worthy as comfort food that is low fat, but does not leave one feeling deprived.",
