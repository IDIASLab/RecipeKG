At Houston's, the peanut sauce is drizzled over the salad (or put on the side if requested). The main dressing is a LIME VINAIGRETTE. you can make a simple lime vinaigrette if you like, or Paul Newman's line makes a light lime vinaigrette that is great - i like very few dressings out of the bottle, and this is one of them. So if you make the salad, toss it in the lime vinaigrette, and then drizzle the peanut sauce after you put the tortilla strips, then you have a Houston's chicken salad. YUM!",

The sauce was good but I should have added the veg. oil as suggested by other reviewers - it clung heavily to the greens.  Also I love spicy but I thought the chili paste was too much.  Maybe cutting it in half or even leaving it out would be prudent.  I tried 1/2 Napa cabbage, wish I had stuck with all romaine.  Oh, and the wontons were great.  If you cut them thin and bake them on a cookie sheet - at low heat as suggested by another user - they puff up and taste great.  Make extra b/c your family might snap them up before the salad is ready.  Oh, and I sauted my chicken in some hoison sauce and sesame oil.  It did add a lot to the taste of the salad I thought.",

I used some reviewers suggestions and added mandarin oranges and substituted napa cabbage for half of the romaine. It was a great suggestion to thin out the dressing with the juice from the oranges. The dressing smelled and tasted wonderful. I shredded the napa cabbage and romaine lettuce really fine. I also substituted chow mein noodles for the wonton wrappers to save time. Thank you, Teri for this great recipe that I will definitely make again!",

After reading other reviews I also deep fried my wonton skins and I highly recommend that touch. I found the amount asked for in the recipe was more than enough however and will probably cut it down next time. Also on the dressing the peanut taste is strong so if you are not really into peanut cut the amount back. I like peanuts but think I will still scale back the peanut butter last time. It felt like it was too overpowering and covered up some of the other lovely favorites. I found this great for a potluck. Just keep the wontons and dressing seperate till right before or things will get soggy.",
