The first time I made it, I almost omitted the 30 minutes of cook time because polish sausage is pre-cooked, but cooking the sausage with the cabbage infuses a fantastic flavor!",

Simmer it slowly and make sure that after you add the cornstarch and brown sugar mixture to watch it closely as there is not much liquid and could burn easily. I simmered it real low and watched it closely. I used Alice White Merlot and it was excellent. I think that by pouring the boiling water over it would soften it a bit and reduce the cooking time. I skipped this step and it turned out excellent. Also the color is wonderful. Definitely a keeper of a recipe. Enjoy!!!",

The only changes that I made are that I added about 1/2 cup of water after the cornstarch and brown sugar mixture because it just didn't look like there was enough liquid. Also I skipped the first step where you poured the boiling water over the cabbage since it just seemed like a pain and I didn't want to wash those extra dishes;) Since you have the cabbage covered for most of the cooking time it sort of steams itself and my cabbage was perfectly soft by the end. I will be making this again!",
