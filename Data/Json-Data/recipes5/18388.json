Here are my adjustments: 3 cups quick cooking oats 1/4 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 tsps baking powder 1/2 tsp salt 3 tsps cinnamon 1/4 tsp cloves 2 eggs 1/4 cup melted butter 1/2 cup applesauce 1 cups milk 3/4 cup raisins or craisins and 1/2 cup chopped pecans or sliced almonds. I bake it in a greased 9x13 at 350 for 25 minutes. I let it cool then cut in 12 servings. The texture and taste is like a soft oatmeal raisin cookie. It's good cold or warmed up with milk on it. I've done a lot of testing to get a good baked oatmeal recipe. We really like this \"adjusted\" recipe. Try it and see what you think.",

As with the previous reviewer I used almonds instead of walnuts. I also sprinkled cinnamon on top for extra flavor. The texture of this is much more dense and chewy than a bowl of oatmeal. I have been heating up in the microwave with milk. With the warm milk it reminds me of Indian pudding, an old settler recipe which I used to love as a child.",
