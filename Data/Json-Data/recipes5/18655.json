We were not disappointed, although hubby thought it was a little salty, even though no additional salt was added. This was a unique combination of marinating ingredients where no one ingredient stood out, creating a flavorful shrimp not dominated or obscured by other seasonings. There is no oil in the recipe, but there IS oil in the curry paste, so if you substitute curry for the curry paste, I'd recommend adding a little vegetable oil to the marinade. We cooked these on the indoor grill on bamboo skewers. I brushed a bit of melted butter over the grilled shrimp skewers for a little richness and shine. Perfect in mere minutes, beautiful and delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
