Alongside the chops (in the sauce) I also added some largely chopped green and red peppers, and some onions. THEY WERE GREAT and a hit with the family... the beer was the perfect taste... not over powering at all!! LOVED THEM!! I would recommend this one again and again!",

I used only half the beer, adding 8 oz. of water.  I topped each chop with a thin slice of onion and then poured the liquid over the chops.  I baked covered with foil for 50 minutes, uncovered them and baked 15 min. more.   This made them more tender and juicy.  I served over rice, but the next time, I'm going to add one cup of uncooked rice to the dish at the beginning.  I think this will absorb some of the extra liquid.  My family liked the taste of these pork chops.",

I was looking to make a meal for a co-op Freezer Swap that would work in the crock pot and was a little cheaper than purchasing 5 roasts.   ...and it had never crossed my mind to use pork chops.  I placed the raw, un-panseared chops in the crock pot and poured the ingredients over them and mixed.  I cooked them for 4 hours on high.  Then removed the chops and cut away the bones, cut/shredded my tender pork chops and threw the meat back into the juice so it  was flavor-ful and juicy, and then scooped it out with a slotted spoon.  I highly recommend cooking this in the crock pot as oppossed to the oven....it concerned me that so many people complained of dryness, but I didn't have this problem at all in my crock.  My husband and I both found this to be flavorful and enjoyed it greatly....I used Michelob Beer, I hate the taste of beer, and have yet to drink more than just a sip, and I can say that the taste of beer was not overwhelming at all.  I have also used Honey Brown in the past to make both my roast and beer bread and have enjoyed the flavor.  I can't wait to hear what my fellow swappers think of this easy meal!!  Good Luck!",
