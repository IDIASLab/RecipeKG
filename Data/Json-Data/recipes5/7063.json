My mix held it\u2019s shape in the bowl, but I still added 1/3 cup sized scoops into a hot cast iron pan. They we nice and crisp on the outside. I think smaller patties are better to avoid soggy centers. I will add a bit more garlic and maybe a dollop the aioli sauce to the remaining batch before cooking a couple more. Texture and balance was good.  Will recommend to everyone I know. This will be added to my regular menu meals.",

I chose to lose the bread as the recipe submitter mentioned because I don't care much for bread and there was plenty with the crumbs. There is a lot going on with these but it all comes together very nicely. My favorite part was that the ingredient list just called for chopped bell pepper and didn't get all specific on which color to use. My opinion has always been to use whichever color you prefer or whichever you already have on hand. I used orange because well that was what I already had on hand. These take a little time to prepare but are totally worth it in the end. Thanks for the great recipe!",
