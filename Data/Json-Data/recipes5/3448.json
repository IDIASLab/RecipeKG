But I have never tried tuna steak until now. This recipe is one of the best I've ever used. Anyone who says this tuna is dry is OVERCOOKING their steak, hello? Seared in a red hot frying pan for about 3-4 minutes on each side, this is succulent, indeed! I've never cooked tuna steak before, and it turned out perfectly...VERY juicy and extremely flavorful (but increase marinade time to at least 2 hours for the full effect!).",

I had to substitute teriyaki sauce (had no soya), which may have made it lighter than the original recipe; I enjoyed it this way. I also used dried herbs, found it okay. If I could make it differently I might crust some whole garlic slices right on to the tuna steak, but this is a bit of an unnecessary flourish. If your tuna comes out \"tough and chewy\" you are cooking it too long. Turn the heat up way high (skillet) or get the coals really going (grill) and sear it. Unless you buy bottom-quality tuna (which you should not), it is safe to cook until the top and bottom are seared but the center is still mostly pink and relatively uncooked. The bacteria grow on the exposed parts, which is why you have to cook the heck out of any ground meat (because the exposed parts have been moved all through the meat).",

Also added chopped green onions (1/4 cup) and a 3/4 tsp rosemary. used fresh garlic (a must in my book!) \n\ni cooked the fish on a skillet. Turned the gas on high and let the pan heat up with a little bit of non-stick cooking spray on it. \n\nheres the best tip (got it from the man behind the fresh fish counter at Whole Foods) - turn the Tuna Steaks every 30 seconds for 3-5 minutes (depending on size of the steak)... perfectly cooked! DO NOT OVER COOK THESE. i had actually intially undercooked them (only 3 minutes). I wanted them to be cooked a little more, so i put them back in the frying pan and seared for 30 more seconds on each side.\n\nyummy!!!!!!",
