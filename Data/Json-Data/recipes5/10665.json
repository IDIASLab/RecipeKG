The soup looks like a classic cream of asparagus, and your eyes will fool your palate to a certain extent. In addition to giving it a nice color, the bumpy superfood cauliflower provides a smoother texture to the soup than the less-starchy asparagus could achieve alone.",

My husband is a diabetic so the carb count is very important. With 9g of carb and 4g of fiber this soup totals only 5 carb grams. (Every g of fiber reduces the carbs by 1 g). And it's packed with vitamins and minerals. This soup is a real bang for your nutrition buck. It tastes like it has cream in it, but it doesn't, so you can freeze this. I made this exactly as written except I didn't have the nasturtium for the garnish. Thank you for this recipe.",

I also cooked down some onion and shallot before adding garlic, because I always like onion in my blended soups. I would recommend adding asparagus after only 10 minutes (rather than 15), because it needs a while to cook. I did add a bit of cream cheese after blending, but only b/c I had some I needed to use up - soup would be just as good without it. Not sure where to get the nasturtiums, but I would try to find them if I wanted a nice presentation.",
