I made this in my crockpot after I Browned the meat and added the rest of the ingredients!\nI did adjust a few things...\nI wanted to make sure I had leftovers and didn\u2019t want it thick. So, I just increased the meat by half a pound, used 2- 14oz cans of broth,  and the tomato paste with garlic and increased it by 1Tbl\nAlso, decreased the lentils to half a cup and added some diced carrots!\nServed it with basmati rice and naan bread.\nEveryone LOVED it and I had my leftovers for my family to pack for lunch the next day!\nDefinitely will make this again!",
