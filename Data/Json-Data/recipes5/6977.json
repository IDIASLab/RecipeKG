I heated the oil on high until it shimmered added the scallops and turned the heat down to med. high and cooked them for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Cooking bay scallops for 6-7 minutes is way too long IMHO. I didn't have a fresh lemon, I was so sure that I did, so I omitted that part of the recipe. Thanks for sharing and I look forward to trying this recipe again.",
