I don't like my food too salty, but did NOT find this recipe to be salty as others have said, could be the fish sauce used, which is important. Don't be afraid of the sound of it, you can't skip the fish sauce! I also like to use the amino soy substitute for the shoyu.  My husband and I like spicy food, so we use at least the recommended amount of chili - preferably the garlic chili paste that comes in a jar with green lid. This is soooo good I'm making it again tonight (over some sticky Japanese rice!). ",

One TB of Sesame Oil and Brown Sugar is enough to create a glaze. You don't need the peanut butter.

However, it enjoyed the flavor, so i gave it another try and the next time i made it i used only 1 tbsp fish sauce and 1 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp rice vinegar.  This resulted in a much more palatable marinade.  I also changed the oil i cooked the chicken in to peanut oil and added a fresh hot pepper (serrano) and a red bell pepper to the mix.  I served all of this over rice and some fresh bean sprouts and topped with fresh cilantro.  I also toasted the cashews (just to deepen the taste and increase the aroma) and added some sesame seeds.  I also squeezed a wedge of lime over the finished dish.   Lots of additions that i felt kind of freshened/coloured it up, while still respecting the original recipe.  This has become a regular dish in our home.  Thank-you for the recipe!",

I used a little less than half the marinade ingredients and used low sodium soy sauce otherwise I am sure it would have been too salty (you can always add salt at the end but you can never take it out). Also the recipe calls for cooking the chicken for 10 minutes to brown it but this really only takes 3-4 minutes. I cooked about 2 minutes added broccoli and red pepper and cooked 2 more minutes then followed the rest of the recipe as written. In my opinion the fish sauce peanut butter and sesame oil are very important flavours to the dish and I wouldn't suggest leaving them out and or replacing with other ingredients.",
