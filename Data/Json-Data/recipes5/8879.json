I cooked mine in the oven on a cake rack set over a cookie sheet, 20 minutes each side at 350. I tried making it again by putting the chicken in a dish and baking but it didn't turn out as well.  If you aren't going to grill it I highly recommend using the cake rack/cookie sheet method.  UPDATE 6/29/07: I cooked the chicken on the grill for the first time the other night and it was so amazing I upgraded this to 5 stars.  I will still make it in the oven in the winter, but this chicken is amazing when made on the grill.",

Perfectly moist and juicy.  Don't bake any longer or thighs will get dry.  (I'm baffled at all these posts that say they bake for 1 hour)  The first time I made these to a T, and it was fantastic, but the long complicated barbecuing was a little tedious.  And since then, I've just baked it in the oven - the last 5 minutes I put on broil to brown a little bit.  And don't wipe the marinade off completely.  It makes a nice thin sauce when it's cooked that's awesome over rice.  Tip - you can also substitute vanilla yogurt for the plain by adding 2-3 tablespoons lemon juice.  Tastes just as good.  Try this recipe - very aromatic and delicious.",

The first time it did not turn out very well (dry not too tasty) but I blame us: learning to use indirect heat on the gas grill only using a sprinkle of salt in the marinate and using natural thighs. The second time the chicken was EXCELLENT but this time I added 1/2 tsp. salt to the marinate marinated them for 2 days in a covered glass dish grilled them on indirect heat (410 degrees) for 35 minutes without lifting the lid and they were done juicy tasty and TO DIE FOR. Don t know if it made a difference but these thighs were 9- percent injected with broth. Will make this many more times while the weather is SO hot. Don t give up if they are not great the first try!!!",
