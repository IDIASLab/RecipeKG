Using thin chops does not require oven cooking.  After searing the pork I take the chops out of the pan and cover to keep warm.  After the sauce is cooked I put the chops back in the sauce and reheat them.  Serve with rice or small noodles, adding the sauce over the rice/noodles and chops.  I gave it 4 stars because the recipe didn't mention using thin pork and it went into the oven.",

Turned out great and there's no need to put in oven bc they cook through perfectly when saut\u00e9ing.   I added the capers in with the wine so they would cook through just a bit.  I love the brininess of the capers and will make again!",

I must admit that I used bone-in pork chops that were almost 3/4\" thick, so I knew I'd need to increase the cooking time.  That being said, even with that thickness, they were almost to 145 degrees by the time I took them from the pan to place in the oven. The sauce was good, but I really wanted to add a little butter at the end.  Even with the use of shallots, I'd be tempted to add some garlic.  Maybe this recipe would be better with pork tenderloin (easier to pound out) and just keep it a shorter prep time.  I'll try that next time.  I think you should try this but use your prior experience to judge what you think should happen with the cooking time!  Loved the sauce!",
