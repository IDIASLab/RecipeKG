I used the cream of mushroom soup & one full soup can of milk instead of water.  Along with the chedder cheese I added about 3/4 C of mozz. cheese & monteray jack that I had in the fridge wanting to use up.  I also added about 3 cloves of crused garlic.  Everyone loved them!  I just threw everything in the crock pot very early in the day & kept it on low for  about 5 hours then went to high for the last hour.  Will be making again & again.",
