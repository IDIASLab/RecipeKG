It's a great way to use up all the tomatillos and greens that we tend to get in our CSA boxes in the Pacific Northwest. This soup is great topped with a quick red onion pickle and crumbled cotija cheese.",

I have substituted kale and butter lettuce or romaine for the arugula and Bibb lettuce when I don\u2019t have the others in stock.  I\u2019ve varied the pepper ratios too to change it up. The tomatillo sauce is very thick to start with but thins as you cook it. Great flavors!",
