Since there's never a shortage of beer in this house or neighbor's to help us eat these birds we always love to make these. I made three of these last night for a BBQ! Two I made with regular paprika and one I made with smoked paprika and I added a couple teaspoons of garlic powder to all three.  It's much easier to take the seasoning mixture and blend it with 1 cup of melted butter and place half of it into the beer can and baste the chicken with the other half. (I bascially had to triple the butter/seasoning for the BBQ).  Invest in the holder that you can purchase at Wal-Mart or Bed, Bath, & Beyond, you'll be glad you did!",

One tip though - before putting the chicken over the can, make sure there's about 2 mouthfuls gone from the can. Some times the beer can splash up and it can get a bit messy. The type of beer also makes a difference - you can play around with differnt kinds.",

Made a couple little changes--a TBL of butter  in the beer and garlic salt for the salt. I plug the neck with a small potato (carrot or apple would work) to keep steam inside and placed the 4.5 lb. bird on a soaked plank (keeps heat indirect while imparting smoke aroma/taste) and cooked at 325\u00b0. Good eatin'.",
