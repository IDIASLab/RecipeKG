I've tried to research and so far I've come up with a TOTAL for the WHOLE recipe of only 663 calories.  So how do they come up with 459 Calories per SERVING?  I use only the chicken breast, no skin, a salad dressing of 40 cal per Tbsp, sweet relish has only 15 cal per Tbsp......?\nI would also like to say ThankYou for your kind reviews. That is the minimum jalapeno I add, often it is a LOT more ;) . Today I used chopped pecans (pine nuts are expensive here too!) I think just about any nut meat would work.",

I also think that roasting the pine nuts would bring out the nutty flavor of the pine nut. As it was written, the pine nuts added a wonderful texture to the salad. Will definately fix again with these few tweaks!",

Even though I liked this after tasting it I felt it lacked something so I added dried cranberries. That made it spicy sweet and savory all at once and kicked it up to where I wanted it. That's a personal preference though--as a recipe this is a neat take on chicken salad sandwiches. Thanks for the recipe!",
