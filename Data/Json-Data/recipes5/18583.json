I used both good and cheap brands and the texture of the cruddy dogs actually works better with the cornbread and made it taste more like a corn dog.  I did cut down the brown sugar a bit (to 1 1/2 Tbsp) but that was personal preference.  This was so easy, super cheap and delicious!  I'm sure I will be using this recipe constantly.  It satisfies the kid in me :)",

I could have squeezed out another two, I think because I filled the tins more than the 2/3 full that it called for. Batter was thicker than I thought it would be when dropping in the hot dogs, but they turned out great. I used 3 slices per muffin instead of half a dog, which I'm not sure would have fit in my muffin tins. The slices were popping out of the top a bit, but it didn't really matter. I served with honey mustard, which made them really delicious. They are pretty hardy, too. I was serving them as a Superbowl appetizer, but they were super filling could definitely be a meal. I can see how kids would love these. I have a couple left today, so I'll see how the keep. I had served them straight from the oven yesterday, so they were perfect. Will definitely make these again.",

I was skeptical about adding the sugar but decided to follow the recipe and it was a big mistake.  These were way too sweet.  I don't think the sugar should be added at all.  I cut the hot dogs into small pieces since my children are small and they are choking hazards, but there really didn't seem to be enough hot dog.  The bread overpowered the muffins.  I might make them again for my children since they did like it but only if they request it.  Also I think I will use the directions on the box and just add the hot dogs.  Thank you anyway for the idea, it just wasn't for us.",
