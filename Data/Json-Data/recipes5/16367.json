I used softened butter and that obviously didn't work. Clarification is needed by the author.",

I upped the yeast to 1 Tablespoon based on some of the comments. I added 1 Tablespoon of vital wheat gluten because I always do (if you can get your hands on this it will greatly improve all of your bread) and I added 3/4 cup of finely chopped pecans because I had them and it seemed like it would go really well with the flavors in the bread (it did!). The finished loaf was high with a beautiful color taste and texture. I served it toasted and spread with a mixture of butter and honey. OMG!! So good.",

I did not use a bread machine; I had no problem with it rising at all. I let it rise in the bowl for 1 hour punched it down and put it in a bread pan where I let it rise for another hour. It smelled yummy is so feather light and moist! The taste is wonderful just a hint of the pumpkin and spices but not overwhelming. I will absolutely make this again and again.",
