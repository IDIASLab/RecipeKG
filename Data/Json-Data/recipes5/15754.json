Though I've made it with ranch dressing or even catalina dressing, my family really prefers it with a \"dressing\" made from salsa and sour cream. You can easily make this into \"Walking Taco Salad\" by using the lunch-bag sized Doritos. You just crumble up the chips inside the bag, open it up and add your ingredients to the inside of the bag. All you need is a fork!",

I drizzled the dressings over rather than toss it all together. My husband did not like the Ranch Dressing and I thought the Italian gave this an odd twang. I would skip those next time and use a sour cream/salsa mix instead like I usually do. Sort of a southwest sour cream sauce. Quick and easy for a weeknight meal without heating up the whole kitchen.

Also I only used 1 cup of ranch and that was plenty for us so maybe start w/ less and add as needed. I think next time I would cut back the Italian dressing a touch but I did like the addition of it in the salad. To serve I put a bed of lettuce on the plate some chopped tomatoes the ground beef mixture and then the crushed Doritos and we just mixed them at the table. The little guy licked his plate clean! Hubby and I enjoyed this too for a different spin on taco salad. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

Than instead of the suggested dressings I mixed sour cream with salsa for a dressing a tip from another reviewer. Thanks for the quick easy kid friendly and adult friendly salad!",
