Also I used german butter potatoes and they cook faster. This isn't the fault of the recipe's but I'm glad I checked on them because they were burning halfway through the broiling. They probably would have been good just after the 40 minutes at 350. Before they started to burn they smelled really really good and actually they weren't too bad as they turned out. I'm sure I will make them again and hopefully this time I'll be better able to taste the sugar. However I will reduce the amount of mixture I shake the potatoes around in.",
