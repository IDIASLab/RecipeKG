I did make some changes based on some ideas I got from other granola recipes I read on this site. I liked the recipe because the ingredient list is short and sweet... a perfect starter recipe and most (if not all) of the ingredients can be found in many kitchens! So here's my changes: I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of maple syrup (in place of the 1/4 cup brown sugar I omitted) I used quick oats I substituted about 1/2 cup pecans for all the walnuts since that's all I had and viola!!! I did have to bake quite a bit longer. I checked and stirred the granola on a baking sheet every 15 minutes for about 45-60 minutes. It was chewy still when I finally took it out but it was golden brown. I left it on the counter top in the pan to cool for several hours and it got crispier and crispier. Finally I put it in a Tupperware container before I went to bed and by then it was very crispy perfect granola!",

I added a cup of chopped pecans to give a little variety and used about 1 1/2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice plus 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of a full two teaspoons of cinnamon. I had trouble getting the oats to clump together but didn't mind because the taste was so great! Next time I make this I might make a little more of the liquid mixture to really coat everything more thoroughly and hopefully get it to clump a little better. My boyfriend couldn't stop eating this and said it got rave reviews when he took it into the office! I highly recommend this simple and relatively-healthy granola recipe!",

I used about 2/3 cup of walnuts and added some raisins as well. Next time though I am going to add all of the walnuts because they got coated with the brown sugary coating and toasted in the oven...so yummy! They made the granola worth eating! I don't think that I over-baked mine but it did turn out very hard almost too hard. The cinnamon and vanilla flavors are very strong...and I only used 1 tsp. of vanilla! All in all this is a good recipe that I will probably make again. Thanks!",

I liked the combination of cinnamon with the walnuts. My main complaint was the oats are super chewy. I think it has to do with the fact there is no oil in this recipe at all. But that makes it healthier so it is a toss up for me. Hence the 3 stars. If I were to make it again I would add 1/2 cup oil 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and less sugar. I'll have to update after these changes are made. Until then I will still enjoy this tasty chewy granola that is not salty.",
