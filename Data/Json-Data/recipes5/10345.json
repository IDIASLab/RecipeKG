I have made Julia Child's version from \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking.\"  Both were very time consuming but delicious.  I've had exquisite cassoulet in France.  This recipe rivals them all at a much lower expenditure of both time and money.  And it is much more heart healthy. Can be done in the evening after work. It is even better the second day.  I used homemade chicken stock and chicken breasts since we were snowed in and had no chicken thighs, which would be a lot better.   Bravo, Chef John!",

I don't have an oven safe skillet so made this in a dutch oven. I used chicken breast (thought I had thighs in the freezer but no) which was fine but I think thighs would be best. I also used breakfast sausage instead of smoked because I prefer the flavor. I also used dried rosemary and thyme (1/2 tsp. each which was plenty). I was worried that I had added to much chicken broth but if you follow all the steps by the end it thickens up so nicely (you'll see if you watch the video). I served this with a green salad with apples and dried cranberries. Thanks Chef John! Another winner!",
