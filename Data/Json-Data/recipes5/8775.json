I did not have the garlic base so I followed others recomendations and used 1 tsp chicken base, 2 tbsp (heaping, I love garlic) minced garlic and 1 tsp garlic powder.  Turned out great! The second change was that I only had 1 chicken breast on hand so I cut it smaller and cooked it through. Then cooked everything on pressure for 5 minutes instead of 15 as everything (besides penne) was already cooked completely. Next time that I have everything on hand I'll make as the recipie states, but I am sure it will still be excellent!",
