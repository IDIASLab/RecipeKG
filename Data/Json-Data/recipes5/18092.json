Used a bag of french fries instead of potatos. Used spagetti sauce grated cheddar and milk as the sauce. (Also used a little more sauce than the recipe called for.) Spicy pork sausage instead of hamburger along with chopped pepperoni. (Next time will heat pepperoni in the microwave on paper towels to get some of the grease out though.) Added chopped green pepper and red pepper flakes after the onion. The boyfriend loved it because it didn't have noodles the french fries turned out great! Had a lasagna/pizza flavor that we loved. Will make it often. this way",
