I do think that the 3-star rating I'm giving it which means average to me is generous. However I did seize upon this recipe because it did inspire me - I did like the idea of the mayonnaise and salsa. So I admit I changed this up quite substantially - and took a mediocre recipe in my book to something awesome good. Canned chicken? No...rotisserie chicken infinitely better. I used a good jarred salsa with a LITTLE minced onion and equal parts mayonnaise and sour cream. Just slathered that creamy sauce on the tortillas (whole wheat) before heaping on the chicken - didn't mix it altogether. Rather than lettuce I used fresh baby spinach leaves. I also piled on some cooked crumbled bacon chopped Roma tomatoes and shredded cheddar cheese. Can't even begin to describe how delicious this was - five stars for sure. This recipe was great for brainstorming but not I'm afraid on its own.",
