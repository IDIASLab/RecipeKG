Well, with this simple formula, and a few easy tricks, you can achieve a fried fish where the last bite is as crisp as the first. The keys are keeping your batter really cold and patting your fish really dry. Serve over a bed of salt 'n vinegar chips with tartar sauce and lemon.",

Placing any hot fried food on paper towels will steam the batter fry and make it less crispy.  Love the other tips as well.  If you have trouble having the batter stick during frying, place battered food in freezer for 12-15 min and remove to the hot oil immediately.",

I made that mistake with the first batch I cooked.  The second batch, I stored in a glass  dish lined with paper towels.  It stayed fresh and crispy.
