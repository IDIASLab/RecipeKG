A couple of little tweaks and  a twist: I coated the chops in cornstarch (as I'm gluten-free), browned them, moved them aside and then sauted the onions.  Then I left the onions on the BOTTOM, put the chops back on, then the potatoes, which I sliced with a mandoline, so they were nice and thin. The whole thing was simply delicious, a perfect late fall hearty dish.  Going right into heavy rotation.  Thanks for it!",

I am always looking for new ways to make pork chops and am so glad I came across this recipe. I did a couple of things differently but overall followed the recipe as is. I used new red potatoes because that's what I had on hand. Next I sauteed the onions and mixed them with the potatoes for layering. I added paprika, garlic powder and salt/pepper to the flour and lastly I only used 2 boullion cubes as several others said it was too salty with three. It was perfect with only 2 so I will continue to fix it this way. Thank you for a delicious, easy, one-skillet meal!",

I fried the pork chops, removed, added a bit of butter, then browned the onions slightly.  I did the rest of the recipe as stated, but I did not put any salt and I replaced the beef granules by 1/2 salt beef concentrate.  It was not salty at all and even my children liked it.  My 7 year old who hates potatoes, liked the potates this way.  Oh, and by the way, I used red potatoes, sliced with the peel on to get some extra vitamins!

                "reviewBody": "I cooked this in an electric skillet, making 6 chops.  I had to make about 6 times the potatoes(yukons are tiny) to fill the pan. On 1 side I made as instructed. The other side I flipped the ingredients, putting the onions & potatoes on the bottom. Here's the deal. The flour leaves a mushy coating on thbe chops no matter what you do. Kind of a turn off. Whatever is on the bottom of the pan gets ALL of the flavor. The potatoes on the bottom were especially awesome but on top, just blah. I actually threw out the chops that were on top. They were....not good. I would not make it again but I would maybe just cook potatoes this way. They were really a hit(those that were on the bottom).",
