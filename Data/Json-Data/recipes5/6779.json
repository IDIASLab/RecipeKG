Never had tinaktak before, in fact never even heard of it, but the ingredient listing piqued my curiosity.  We really enjoyed this dish, and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.  Don\u2019t omit the water chestnuts, as I think that crunch is important to this entree.  We opted to serve this with noodles rather than rice and will do that again.  This was a splurge nutritionally, but all things in moderation, right?  I certainly can understand why this is one of Guam\u2019s favorite comfort foods, because it\u2019s just flat out tasty!",

I literally looked in the pantry and saw some coconut milk and had some  ground beef, this was the only recipe that came up by ingredient search and I'm so glad it did!  \n\nThe only thing I omitted were the water chestnuts (didn't have any but would have been great) and the hot pepper/chilis because that's not our thing.  \n\nI cooked it pretty much to spec and it came out wonderful.  The slight changes I did were: \nI used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh (didn't have) 2 onions vs 1 \nProbably more green onions than suggested\nA little more soy \nAnd instead of regular oil for saut\u00e9ing, I used raw, unfiltered coconut oil\nAlso added some of that (coconut oil) to the rice instead of butter to bring that flavor out.\n\nWow, thank you so much for posting this, we all loved it and I'll keep this as a standby now.

My family said it tasted better than the restaurant versions they had eaten.  Tonight I made it again but I added a medium sized eggplant and put only 2 small donne hotpeppers, not smashed. And instead of ground beef, I used ground chicken, a little more that a pound.  It came out perfect, not greasy or oily at all.  Finally, instead of using canned string beans, I used the local long beans and cut them into 1 inch bite size pieces.    Next time I will make it for our dinner guests too.  Thank you Sheila!!",
