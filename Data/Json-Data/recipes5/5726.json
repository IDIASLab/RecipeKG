                "reviewBody": "This was pure comfort food for me.  I used Blackened Seafood seasoning to season the bottom of the pan, the fish and added some to the sauce and the potatoes too.   I made the spinach and set aside, not everyone in the family likes spinach (silly peeps) so I layered the seasoned fish and the sauce, topped with the potatoes.... reserved some of sauce to mix with the spinach.   Cooked the fish at 400 for 25 minutes and then turned on the broiler to brown the top.  I had already sprinkled the seafood seasoning on top of the potatoes so it did not take long to brown up.  I reheated the spinach with the reserved sauce and spread a layer of that in a shallow plate, topped with the fish and potato casserole.  It made a lovely presentation and tasted WONDERFUL.   A couple of tips - make sure your fish is fully defrosted and blotted very dry with paper towels prior to seasoning.  This can be made with leftover mashed potatoes but re-heat the potatoes prior to layering and baking.  There were no leftovers - the pan was licked clean.  Good thing I got a picture before dinner!",

I've made it once as written (except for using tilapia instead) and it was quite good just like that.\n\nSince then I've changed a few things for my own personal taste. The things I do different are to continue using tilapia and to include a can of corn with the spinach. It adds a nice sweetness and little crunch to the dish. The other thing I change is adding garlic powder to the potato topping. Being the garlic lover I am I also put at least 4 cloves of garlic (pressed) into the roux (depending on their size). Besides that the only other changes is that I omit lemon as I don't always have lemons on hand.",

                "reviewBody": "The flavor was OK if unexciting. What did not appeal to us most notably was the lack of texture in this dish. The combo of soft fish white sauce wilted spinach and mashed potatoes was just a little too much soft stuff for us. Also needed some color contrasts as everything was a lot of white punctuated by the olive colored spinach which loses its bright green as it cooks. Maybe include some saut\u00e9ed julienned carrots or finish with a few bits of fresh tomato. As is it failed to excite either the eyes or the palate both of which are important elements of a satisfying meal.",
