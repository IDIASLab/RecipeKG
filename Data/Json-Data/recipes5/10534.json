I used tilapia instead of sea bass because I didn't want to bother with my grill, and because my grocery store had a great deal on fresh tilapia. I saut\u00e9ed the tilapia in a teaspoon of coconut oil over medium high heat for maybe 3-4 minutes per side. I accidentally used 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. I was worried it would overpower the dish, but thankfully the sauce was very forgiving and still balanced. I also (intentionally) used 2 cloves of garlic because I love it so much. I served this with cauliflower \"rice\" (I Ross some cauliflower in the food processor until it is the consistency of rice) saut\u00e9ed with chopped shiitake mushrooms; snap peas tossed with a wee bit of sesame oil, soy sauce, and lots of black pepper-cooked under the broiler.",
