Instead of using the mixture as a marinade, just put it in the crock pot with either the chicken as indicated or with a good pork shoulder.  The flavors REALLY come out in the slow cooking process and gives a very aromatic and great tasting jerk flavor.  Note though, I used one habanero pepper.  If you really like it hot, add more, but know that you get the full effect from the pepper in the crock pot!",
