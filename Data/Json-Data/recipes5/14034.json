You could just tell as you chopped up the ingredients and mixed them up that you were going to be in for something good. I did tinker with it a little though but more just to personalize it to our tastes. I left out the \"hot\" stuff which Hubs doesn't tolerate well. I backed off on the onion a little so it wouldn't overwhelm added minced garlic a finely chopped jalapeno pepper a small amount of fresh cilantro and about 3/4 tsp. of cumin all flavors I typically enjoy in traditional guacamole. I also chose to leave the avocados a little chunky rather than completely mashing them. It took a fair amount of chopping for this recipe but it was worth it. I served it for a dinner get-together and everyone had at it. A real winner.",
