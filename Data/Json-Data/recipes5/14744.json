The flavor profile is almost identical to an apple pie, but instead of having a bunch of slices about, we have one beautifully roasted, tender, sweet apple inside--which while still covered in the same crust we use for a pie, is far superior because we basted and baked it with a sugar sauce. I highly recommend these get served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.",

I used 4 different types of apples, Envy, golden delicious, fuji, and honey bee.  After 60 minutes of baking, the former two types likely resulted in better texture.  The Fuji was a bit too firm for my liking.  The overall flavour could use something to give it more interest.  Maybe next time I\u2019ll add a few Crasins in the apple.  The dumplings were not as sweet as I thought they would be even though the syrup itself was sweet.  I made 10 apple dumplings, but in hindsight I really didn\u2019t need to double the syrup, because now I have nearly a cup of it left over.  This recipe is a good starting point.",
