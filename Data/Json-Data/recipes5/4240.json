Be aware that this tastes like an olive hummus, rather than a hummus with a traditional tahini taste, so I consider this more a recipe for a specialty hummus than for a basic hummus.  That being said, this was a hit with my family and friends.  We enjoyed the rich, Mediterranean olive taste, and I enjoyed snacking on the leftovers at work knowing that it was a relatively low-calorie version of hummus.  The olives are cheaper than tahini, too.  I think I'll definitely make this again -- for basic snacking, I like that it gives a hummus flavor with less calories.  Thanks for the recipe!",
