Normally I wouldn't use a recipe with only one review for something so expensive but I trust this submitter's recipes and I wasn't disappointed! Other than using less crab I followed the recipe to the T.  Honestly, this tasted like it just came off of the boat! I'm so happy that I found this recipe and it will be my go to going forward. I served this with a simple Caesar salad and Spaetzle. I forgot to mention that I used a cleaver to cut these  into pieces that would fit into my 6 quart Instant Pot, start to finish, 14 minutes. Thanks Nicole, I throughly enjoyed this!",
