Nancy, I gave this 5 stars because I don't usually like lamb, but I really liked this recipe.  I only make lamb occasionally because my husband likes it so much.  I did make a couple of very minor changes as follows... 1. I diced my own fresh tomatoes - 1 plum, 1 heirloom, and 1 medium size round, instead of using canned.  2. I substituted a full-bodied red wine instead of white.  3. I used a few sprinkles of dried thyme instead of fresh.  4. I added 1 Tbls. of fresh chopped garlic and 1 small fresh peeled finely diced beet.  The only change I made in the directions was that I cooked it on high in my slow cooker for 4 hours (I was short on time).  I served it over parmesan cous cous, and it was absolutely delicious!  I'm saving this to my recipe box.  Thanks Nancy!",

His work made it Friday before Easter.  Burnt the  out of it.  I followed your recipe not knowing he had it at work and  it was super tender . Only rarely can one get lamb where I live.   He hated it.  He will not be getting it again or anything of this quality.. I added more garlic and herbs.  Thickened sauce with cornstarch after skimming fat.  Used red wine and beef broth.  Seated meat as instructed.  Cooked 6 hours on low .  Perfect.   Gave entire leftovers to my daughter who raves.",
