Here's how I modified this recipe.  1) I scaled it for 12 people; 2) I used 6 cans of Campbell's Tomato Bisque soup w/ 5 cans of water; 3) I used 3, 6-oz cans of premium white crab meat (Kroger brand); 4) I used white pepper instead of black.\n     I did not follow directions.  Instead, I sauteed the green onions and dumped them along with everything else except the cream into my 6 qt. slow cooker the night before.  After stirring, I took out a small amount to heat in the microwave and season to taste.  I added way more Old Bay, cayenne, and white pepper than the recipe called for (Campbell's is too sweet so it needed it!). \n     I took it to work, straight from the fridge, and plugged it in.  About an hour before serving, I added the cream and more white pepper.  It was delicious -- a smash hit -- and ridiculously easy (less than 15 minutes, TOTAL).",
