I made a couple small changes; we didn't enough lemon juice so I substituted 1 cup of the lemon juice for lemon-lime soda and reduced the honey to about 1 1/4 cups. I also heated the marinade before putting the meat in to allow the honey to melt and the flavors to meld. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a tasty alternative to plain old pork chops just be careful to watch the chops so they don't over cook! And marinate overnight:) Thanks for a great recipe and I hope more people will try this:D",
