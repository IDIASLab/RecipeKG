I wasn t expecting to love it but I did. I thought it would be too tangy - but it wasn t. Familiar with how boldly flavored (toasted) sesame seed oil is and how little is required to make its statement I was tempted to cut back on it and rather severely. But because I am this recipe s first reviewer I believed it was important to offer an opinion on the recipe just as written. (Down the road however subsequent reviewers should feel free to tweak to their heart s content) So I prepared the dressing exactly as specified (just using grapeseed oil instead of canola oil which I don t use) and cooked the onion till nearly caramelized. I must tell you that once the dressing began to boil the odor actually was tangy and pungent irritating in my nose but I plodded on! This salad is simply beautiful. It is a remarkably elegant presentation and a taste delight different from anything I have ever tried. The sesame oil is a creative and delicious addition to the dressing and the choice of ingredients is sublime. This to my admitted surprise is a real winner.",

I was looking for a last-minute salad to make with my homemade pizza last night and spinach was the only leafy green I had to work with so I searched for a spinach salad. I was intrigued by this one and I am SO glad I found it! My husband said \"Mmmm...this is delicious\" after the first bite and raved about it with every single bite after that. He's usually not keen on healthy substitutions for things but he said he missed absolutely nothing with this compared to the bacon grease version. We craved it and made it again tonight and he said he would like to have it very often. Thanks so much for this recipe!!!",
