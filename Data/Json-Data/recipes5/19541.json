The blueberries really made these muffins moist and for my taste I think it had too many blueberries as it went mushy. So next time I will decrease the berries. The orange flavour was really nice and delicate it didn't overpower the bran muffin. We really liked this muffin. Thx.",

For the life of me, I couldn't find any oat bran, except Kellogg's Cracklin Oat Bran, but that had cinnamon and nutmeg in it, plus it would have had to be crushed.  For her Christmas present, I gave my daughter a \"snack of the month\".  This month's theme was Bran, and these went into that package.  I had to bake them 18 minutes.  I used a large navel orange.  You can really taste the orange in them.  I used frozen blueberries, and did not thaw them before adding them to the flour.  These muffins really are good.  I recommend them.",
