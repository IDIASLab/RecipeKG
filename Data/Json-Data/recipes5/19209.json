I didn't have any wheat germ so I used ground flaxseed instead and just eliminated whole flaxseed. These freeze great and can be eaten right from the freeze (they don't get too hard). No more energy bars from the store for us! They also feel you up pretty good. Works great for a quick breakfast if you are in a hurry. I will DEFINITELY make these again!!",

Recipe is great as is but when you start to get bored of it try mixing it up a little. Try cocoa powder apple pie spice reese peanut butter bits peanut butter trail mix M&M's or anything else that sounds interesting to mix up the flavours. I've made this a couple dozen times and always add a couple extra cups of filler (trail mix expecially). A hint for handling the sticky dough; spray your hands lightly with no stick cooking spray when mixing/patting it into the casserole dish and it'll handle much better. These keep very well--I usually get 10-14 days out of the fridge b4 they mould or go 'off' and around a month in the fridge and have frozen as long as six months.",

                "reviewBody": "These are surprisingly very good! Not 'very good for health food' good. Just plain good! 4 stars because although I actually followed the recipe and ingredients exactly my bars are just slightly crumbly unless frozen. The reviewer who said they're a little cake like is correct - these are different than what you get in the box at the store. But they are genuinely filling and taste great. Sweet but not 'candy bar masquerading as health food' sweet. It will be easy to make different flavors of this for the kidlet who has happily taken them to school all week. I think the recipe needs modification but I am a big fan. EDIT: made again using 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce instead of 1 full cup oil and halved the brown sugar. Found no change in flavor/texture. Still a little crumbly. I also tripled the cinnamon and it didn't change much at all. We've since added coconut almonds and almond extract for almond joy bars. We subbed the chocolate for craisins and the vanilla for lemon extract for lemon cranberry bars. I'm using flax meal (ground flax) instead of seeds because the seeds are undigestible so they're useless in the recipe as-is. UPDATE: replacing all the oil with pureed pumpkin works perfectly too and an extra egg (or equivalent of egg whites) keeps them from crumbling.",

I did only give it 4 stars because the bars could have used a little more egg or something to stick better... I was nervous that they would taste a little \"cardboard\" because they only used whole wheat flour but they were fine just as written. I might try using half oil and half applesauce to cut down on the oil - if I do I'll post an update. As is - they are great though! (they remind me a little of my PLAYGROUP GRANOLA BARS!
