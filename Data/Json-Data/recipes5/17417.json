The longer I boiled it the thicker it got. After it set a little it was a nice thick creamy syrup. We all enjoyed it on french toast and my mom said it was wonderful on ice cream. Just watch it when it boils and constantly whisk it as it would probably burn easily. Yum! Would love to try this on apple dumplings or apple crisp. Thanks Wanda",
