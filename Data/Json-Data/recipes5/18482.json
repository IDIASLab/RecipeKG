I would advise using unsweetened coconut and only half as much reduce or eliminate the brown sugar use only half as much coconut milk twice as much sour cream and only 1-2 tsp allspice (an entire tablespoon was too too much for my taste!)I would cut way down on the butter as well; my refrigerated leftovers developed a layer of hardened butter a half-inch thick.

I served it with brown rice which was OK but I hate I didn't get to have something really good for supper when I get so little to eat at all. I made it exactly like the recipe was written but the steak was tough as shoe leather. Maybe I should blame it on the cow(?)
