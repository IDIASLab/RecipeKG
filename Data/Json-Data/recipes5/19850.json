This time I substituted some of the water with a good rootbeer used a little honey bourbon(don't worry, the alcohol cooks out) and some honey, cut back on the sugar a little bit and balanced out the sweetness with some hot sauce and red pepper flakes. It was much much better the second time around. Hope someone trys my version and I hope you like it!!",

I grew up on carolina bbq so I can't give this 5 stars.... but for bbq from a slow cooker and not a bbq pit this is awesome\n\nHere are my mods:\nUsed Sweet Baby Rays Maple Sugar bbq sauce and left out the honey and brown sugar. it was plenty sweet enough\nI dumped about half a bottle of hot sauce into my pot before it had enough kick to it\nI left out the celery\nAdded a few splashes of white vinegar and maybe a teaspoon of spicy brown mustard\n\nthis turned out so well I'll probably make it again for a fourth of july party I'm going to.

Anyway, I wanted to address the consistency of the sauce. Yes, it's a bit watery, but I have a great fix. After removing the pork shoulder from the crock to shred it, use an immersion blender on the sauce remaining in the pot. Just whizz it all up. This will not only thicken the sauce but also more evenly distribute the flavors. Once done, add the shredded pork back to the pot. If you don't have an immersion blender, get one lol. Kidding. A regular blender would work too. Hope this helps!",
