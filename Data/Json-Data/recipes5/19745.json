And since there's never a shortage of beer in this house or neighbor's to help us eat these birds they've become a favorite. One I made with regular paprika and one I made with smoked paprika and I added a couple teaspoons of garlic powder to each one. It's much easier to take the seasoning mixture and blend it with melted butter vs. veg. oil and place half of it into the beer can and baste the chicken with the other half. Invest in the holder that you can purchase at Wal-Mart or Bed Bath & Beyond you'll be glad you did!",

I used indirect heat (one side of grill turned off), kept the temp at 350 turning the chicken around halfway thru.  Best chicken ever - moist and tender and flavorful.  We are SO using this to make dinner for Father's Day.  Best thing?  No hot oven to overheat the house during the summer.  Thanks, this is a keeper! :)",
