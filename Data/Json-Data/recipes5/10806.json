When the rice is almost cooked I make holes  on the surface and crack the eggs into these holes. Add some shaved cheese over the eggs, cover and let cook for 10 min or so.

I serve this over kale or spinach for him to fill out the meal.  Frankly I was surprised at how much I liked this, the egg adds a creaminess to the dish that is surprising.

Used Italian brand, Dei Fratelli, diced toms instead of crushed, no water.  Spicy, but not too spicy.  Jalapeno was kinda wimpy though.  Liked this.
