I'm also not a big olive fan (though I like olive oil go figure) and couldn't find any capers. So I cut out the olive cut out the capers. The salt I just eyeballed and more or less only used slightly more than I'd use for any vegetable sweat. I couldn't believe the flavor and the aroma I could have eaten a whole pan of it. My wife loved it too. This one will become a regular. One thing I'd advise is to make sure you don't rush the onions. It can take a long time (longer than is indicated on this recipe) to properly carmelize them on low heat and if you put them on high heat they'll just burn. So don't be suprised if it takes 30 minutes.",

No capers kept everything else but added no salt. The Kalamata Olives were salty enough and they flavored the dish just right. We found fresh Kalamatas in an open deli case next to the meat dept. in our natural foods store. Be sure to let the onion carmelize it helps with the taste of the dish. Easy to prepare good tasting even to me! Overall a great recipe. Thanks",

So when I give this recipe five stars it's more like ten stars when adjusted for my extreme-anti disposition. I made it with these ingredients exactly. The only change I made was to slow-caramelize the onion (took 30-40 minutes). I'm not a huge olive caper or salt lover but man the sweet-bitter-salt-acid combo is PERFECT. This would be pretty average if you took out one of those elements I do believe. I ate some by itself and some spiced up w/ pepper flakes on a little chipotle tortilla with pepper jack. Both ways were marvelous.",
