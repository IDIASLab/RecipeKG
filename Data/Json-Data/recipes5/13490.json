DH thought there was too much oregano but I used mexican instead of italian so that may have been why. I only did two onions and there wasn't enough batter for all of it. So if you are doing 4 you should double the stuff. I used egg beaters in the carton for this. My DH had me do some shrimp in this too and said it was a winner. This is a definite keeper thanks Luna.",

Also--for an easier and quicker clean up forget the separate bowls and put the sliced onions in a gallon-size ziplock bag. Add the flour mixture and shake to coat all onions. Then simply pour in the liquid mixture and shake again. Finally add in the bread crumb mixture and shake. Make sure to separate the onions before you fry them. This is much easier and clean up is a breeze!",

I only had 3 onions but there was lots of extra flour/egg/breading to do more. My husband suggested cuting the onions thiner but I enjoyed them as is.
