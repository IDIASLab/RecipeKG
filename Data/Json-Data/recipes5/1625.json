I drained the sourkraut but didn't rinse it, because we like the tangy taste of the sourkraut.  I buttered rye bread slices on one side and spread Thousand Island dressing on the other side.  On the dressing side I placed a slice of swiss cheese, sliced  Pastrami from the deli and then topped with sourkraut.  I cooked them on my George Foreman grill until the cheese was melted and the bread was nice and toasted.  They were delicious!  I only gave the four star rating because the sourkraut in the middle wasn't very warm.  Next time I make these I will warm the sourkraut in the microwave first and maybe add another slice of swiss too!  If you like Rueben sandwiches you will love this one!",

Maybe 5 at most from start to finish. If this recipe works for you, then good. However, we do it quite differently. We start off by putting approximately 1/4 cup sauerkraut (we never measure it, we just grab some) on the grill, and a bag of about the same amount of chip corn beef on top of that. Then we put two pieces of bread down with some butter, and put two pieces of swiss cheese on each piece of bread. Once the sauerkraut and beef has heated up for a minute or two, we put it on one piece of bread, and put the 1000 island dressing on the other piece. As I said before, it shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes to make.",
