The reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is that there were too many pots/skillets and it tasted like it was missing something. Instead of all the dirty pans I cooked the bacon in a dutch oven then put it aside then put the ground turkey (I don't usually eat beef) in the same dutch oven. When it was almost cooked I added the onion/celery/peppers. Then completed step 2 and moved on to adding the beans and seasonings. This seemed so much simpler! The missing ingredient that really rounded out the flavors was tomato paste. Will absolutely make this again following my simple tweaks and adding the tomato paste. Hubby loved it!",
