I think the 3 hour wait time for the flavors to blend was a bit too much as by the time we served this the pasta had soaked up all of the dressing and the flavors were really lost. I would dress it maybe half an hour before serving next time. We ended up having to add more balsamic lemon juice and oil to flavor it up before eating.",
