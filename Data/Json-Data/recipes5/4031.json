Believe it or not, I actually \"invented\" this recipe a few weeks ago when I happened to have a leftover ciabatta, some bruschetta salsa that a friend had canned and given to me (minus the feta) and my usual hummus that I always have on hand.  I was just Googling Hummus and Bruschetta to see if anyone else had ever thought to use them together.  In my mind, the cumin in the hummus together with the italian herbs in the bruschetta salsa might not be \"considered\" a good combo (even though I absolutely loved the result) Now that I know three other people here loved it, I can feel more confident about serving it to guests.  :)",
