The fresh ingredients make the dish taste a thousand times more complicated and gourmet than it really is, which is another reason this large dish is great to feed a crowd. Serve with crusty bread to mop up the delicious, creamy sauce, and prepare for compliments. Even the leftovers are to die for!",
