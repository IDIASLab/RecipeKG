(I actually cooked it down and added about a cup and a half of stock and it made a huge difference to supplying those needed low and medium notes.) I also had to add three times the amount of honey and twice the amount of lemon juice called for. I used Pasilla Negro chiles instead of the ancho because my grocery store didn't have ancho. I also used two chipotle chiles canned in adobo sauce (Goya product) instead of the other chiles. A couple extra spoonfuls of the adobo sauce really improved the flavor as well supplying those missing lower notes. I'll make this again but will make sure to use the above changes to get a fuller flavor.",
