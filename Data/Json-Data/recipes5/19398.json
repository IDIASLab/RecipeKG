I didn't have chipotle powder so I substituted ground cayenne pepper; I also didn't have garlic powder so I put 1/6 tsp garlic salt. I was very afraid that these weren't going to be appetizing I don't care much for sweet potatoes and had some after the holiday to get rid of. I was pleasantly surprised by the way these hash browns tasted. Sweet when you first put them in your mouth and then with a spicy kick! Will make them again if I come across sweet potatoes!",
