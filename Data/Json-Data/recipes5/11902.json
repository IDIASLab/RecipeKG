After refrigerating overnight the cake was really good, a few spots where the frosting was a little sparser were dry which is why I would recommend making 1.5x the frosting recipe in the future. The texture feels similar to firm lady finger in a tiramisu to me and the flavor is very subtle, I got the honey flavor from the frosting more. Would make again! Was really fun to make a cake using silpats and I think from now on I will make all my cakes 8 layer on silpats because the frosting can be more evenly distributed through 8 layers and it gives that perfect frosting to cake ratio in every bite! Thanks Chef John! :)",
