I used all natural peanut butter used 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil no shortening and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and the balance in all-purpose. These are definately a keeper!!

And by accident I only used 1 cup of brown sugar. I didn't notice a lack of sweetness by any means; perhaps the sweetness in the applesauce balanced this out. The cupcakes came out moist with a delicious peanut butter flavor not overpowering. I frosted them with milk chocolate frosting and my peanut butter-loving fiance said they were \"the best food\" he has ever had! I put about 10 of the cooled cupcakes (w/o frosting) in a ziplock bag and froze them. To thaw simply take cupcakes out of the bag about 45 minutes before you want to eat them. Tasted so fresh and moist! I will definitely make these again.",

I had to fill them too full causing them to spill over the cupcake liners. Second they did not raise like cupcakes should; they came out of the oven flat. Third I had to bake them about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated in order for them to be fully baked. Fourth when I tried to remove them from the pan the tops (that were baked out over the liners) just fell off. They tasted okay but not good enough to make again even if I wouldn't have had the above-mentioned problems. I dont' understand how this recipe got such good ratings. I rely on the ratings to decide which recipes I will try. This was certainly a dud! I'm really miffed that I wasted my ingredients and my time!",
