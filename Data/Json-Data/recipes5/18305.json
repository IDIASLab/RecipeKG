Here in Houston tomato season is over at the end of June but we're still getting peppers and cukes so everything except the cabbage and onions came fresh from the garden. I did salt the veggies and squeezed them dry but did not rinse. I also cut the sugar in half as my family doesnt care for sweet relishes/pickles. Used a small food processor to roughly chop veggies. Wish I had a bigger one. Tasty fragrant and visually appealing product. My house smells fantastic. Excellent spice combo/ flavors. This will be standard end of tomato season fare!",
