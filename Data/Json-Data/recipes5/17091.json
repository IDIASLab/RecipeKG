A few changes, such as cook onion until nearly done then add garlic (otherwise it will almost always burn before the onions are done!), add 1T liquid smoke after simmering. I also added 2T honey and a few grinds of chipolte pepper flakes for a bit of spark.  We also BBQ (indirect heat method with a packet of hickory chips), not grilled, our chicken (whole split) after giving it a good browning on the grill. We let ours cook until done - a little over 2.5 hours basting every 15 min near the end.   Double or Triple the sauce recipe if you like extra for dipping/basting.  As written, this is really a pretty good family style sauce and recipe! I'll make it again for sure!",
