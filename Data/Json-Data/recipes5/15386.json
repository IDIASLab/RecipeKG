I did slightly alter the recipe as I combined it with a different recipe for roasted cabbage.  In your comments you mention how roasting brings out a little sweetness, so I added a very light sprinkling of sugar in addition to salt and pepper.  I also did not have carraway seeds and actually served this with a chicken enchilada casserole and street corn, instead of an Irish or Easter type meal.  Both of us wanted more cabbage!!",
