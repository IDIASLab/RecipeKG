I made it almost to the letter, other than I had only Shitake mushrooms on hand.\nIt turned out really yummy... there are a few mods I would do next time: cook the rice in broth, only add 1/2 cup of wheat germ and instead 1.5 cups of oat bran.  Wheat germ is rather bitter.  Also I am thinking of maybe incorporating some brown sugar into the loaf as well.\n\nI served it with the brown sugar glaze on top.\n\nThanks so much for sharing!",
