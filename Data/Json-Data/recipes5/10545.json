I could eat that alone, but I think I would die from acute gout :) I had no fresh thyme, so I subbed a tablespoon of dry thyme. I could not find Aleppo peppers at my market so I just skipped that entirely. Other than that, made this to a \"T\" and it was a hit. I put cut up red potatoes around the bird at the start and brushed them with the excess olive oil. Served it along with a wonderful Chardonnay and stuffed eggplant..... YUM!!!!! Thanks for making us feel like millionaires for a night Chef John!",

I too will be leaving it out.  I am sure dried Thyme was not an issue either. Sometimes we just have to go with what we know and have on hand.  Thank you Mauigirl for your post.",

I sent the video to everyone I knew because it was so good. I doubled the creme fraiche recipe because I wanted to make sure I had enough sauce for all the chicken.
