It's perfect and hardens well enough to keep decorating in 2 hours (at least in my low humidity area). I'm so happy with how our first ever gingerbread house turned out that I'm submitting my pictures. I did not use any frame I simply glued the cookies together as directed in this recipe walls first wait one hour til dry then roof added wait another hour or two then decorate in two steps. I did make the cookies 3 days in advance not because they needed to dry that long just because I got busy and the house had to wait. It turned out great though! I plan to keep this icing recipe on hand for anytime I need an easy to use and very sturdy icing for decorating.",

Cookie tasted great and my girls had a great time putting together our first gingerbread houses. (Had to make 2 so no fighting would happen) Will make again with adjustments to recipe.

I made houses cookie cutter cookies and freeform dough shapes (the letters of my honey's name specifically). I followed other reviewers' advice and added quite a bit of flour and wasn't shy with kneading more flour in prior to rolling. (In fact the more flour that ended up in the dough as I kept rolling it out the better it turned out.) I used Royal Icing I which was okay and I used a \"kid-sized\" elf house pattern for the building plans. Didn't use cardboard backing either. I posted a photo of my cookies and the initial stages of our very-sloppy gingerbread houses in my Cook's Photos if anybody's curious. Just remember... we've never done this before!!! Next time I might trim my cookies before gluing them together for a better fit. Or I'll cut the dough straighter in the first place!",
