I was out of lemon so I added a little lemon pepper spice instead--now I'm not a fan of spicy food but it was a little  overpowering.  I guess most other people would like it that way but, not my wife, so next time I'll just leave it out. I did use olive oil sprinkled on but next time I will get a can of generic olive oil cooking spray and spray both the grill rack and evenly coat the spears once they are laid on the rack. I don't like to waste anything so I spread the unused panko-cheese  mixture over the spears which were closely spaced on the rack before baking it. These taste better and are healthier  than french fries!",
