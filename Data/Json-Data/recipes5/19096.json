After tweaking a bit, I have come up with a very versatile version that my family and friends love. Season with ground white pepper and use it as a side dish for pork or chicken. Sprinkle with toasted almonds and spoon it over vanilla bean ice cream, angel food, or pound cake for dessert! Play around with the spice combination by adding cloves, allspice, or cayenne.  Be adventurous!",

I had intended to serve this dish as an accompaniment but as soon as I tasted them just out of the oven, I decided that we should have this as a dessert sauce with French vanilla ice cream. So we did.\nI made this as written except I didn't have cardamom so I omitted it. Also, I used six plums instead of four. Going forward, I would probably double the recipe to ensure plenty of the liquid, and I would perhaps cut the plums into quarters rather than halves if serving as a dessert sauce. If it is being served with an entree, then the plum halves would work fine.",

Give this a try, it's not only tasty and easy, but GOOD FOR YOU too.  ***UPDATE 7.26.16***  I have probably made this recipe a dozen times, and we just never tire of it.  It has just the right amount of sweetness, and the flavor of the plum is not masked by too much sugar like many other plum recipes.  This is our FAVORITE!!  ***UPDATE 11.7.18*** We continue to love this dessert, making it often, not only because it tastes delicious, but also. because it's so darn easy to make.  Just one more comment.  These plums are good served either warm or chilled.  I make no changes to this recipe other than using Truvia\u00ae brown sugar as a substitute.",

I didn't use nearly have of the sauce to cover the plums. And when I \"drizzled\" the sauce over top all the sauce pooled on the bottom of the pan and did not thicken or bubble while cooking. I ended up thickening the left over sauce with cornflour till it was REALLY thick and stirred it into some warmed custard. On the plus side my toddler ate 3 plum pieces and the sauce/custard without any hesitation.",
