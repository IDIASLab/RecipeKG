The most important thing to take from these reviews is to DOUBLE THE SAUCE.  My relatives would not want to eat any of these that have made this as is. ...just doesn't taste like anything you'd have at a good restaurant (as this is american chinese, not authentic).  Doubling the sauce ingred. was just the right amount of sauce to accompany a side of rice.  Don't overcook the steak.  Frying until you get a nice brown color is the perfect way to tell if it's done & the estimate times on the recipe are pretty accurate assuming your slices are thin.  Any mixture of veggies work (mushrooms, carrots, frozen peas, red peppers, sliced zucchini, water chestnuts) ...or just grabbing a frozen stir-fry bag of veggies.  I add half a bag, and use the other half for the crispy orange chicken from this site that I also make when I'm making oriental food for guests.  Red Wine VINEGAR is an acceptable substitution, but I'd encourage you to try more recipes on this site using rice vinegar!",

I did alter the recipe some by adding canned slice mushrooms, water crescents, green onion, and baby corn to the veggies. I also used a snow pea stirfry veggie mix to get more of a variety of veggies (I love'em!). I used butter instead of cooking oil as well to add flavor. Since there were so many veggies, I doubled the sauce mixture and used garlic red wine vinegar in place of the rice wine since I couldn't find it at the  store. Served over white rice with chow mein noodles over top. Delicious!",
