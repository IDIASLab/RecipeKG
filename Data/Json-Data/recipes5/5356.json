The sweet raisins tangy balsamic vinegar and peppery arugula simply blend naturally with the savory breaded cutlet. The only reason I see this as a 4-star recipe is method. I had originally intended to just bake it skipping the frying step but wanted to keep to the recipe. I preheated the oven then once I had pan-fried the cutlet it was cooked. So either pan-fry or bake but both is really unnecessary. Also a recipe easily adapted to a gluten free diet. Thank you for the scrumptious recipe!",
