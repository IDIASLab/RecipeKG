You can experiment with different vegetables, or add diced chicken. Feel free to be creative with your amounts - I usually freestyle and end up with leftover stuffing mixture, which tastes great on its own the next day. For vegetarians, substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth.",

My boyfriend hates raisins and he wasn't won over to liking them in this recipe either though I thought the raisins were the best part. I used vegetable broth since it's what I had on hand but I think chicken broth would've been better. I also added some chopped chicken breast. This made WAY more filling than needed for 4 halves of acorn squash and I wasn't crazy about the filling by itself. It was missing something. If I were to make this again I would tweak around the spices probably add more cinnamon and/or ginger.",
