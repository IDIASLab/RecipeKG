I also added frozen roasted corn (as corn was suggested by the top review). I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. This is now one of my favorite ways to eat zucchini!

I was hunting for a Mexican vegetable dish to go with my chicken enchiladas and this definitely fit the bill! I grew up in Southern California and love Mexican food but had never had anything like this before. It was delicious and will be my go-to vegetable for serving with Mexican meals from now on! My opinion isn't the one that counts though. My husband invited a young family over on the spur of the moment. I was a little worried about serving them something I had never made before but decided I couldn't go wrong with all the rave reviews. It was this or meatloaf and chicken enchiladas just seem a better \"company\" meal to me. Anyway I had everything just about ready when they got here and I discovered that the husband is actually Mexican! I'm talking native Mexican! When he saw these calabacitas on the table his eyes absolutely lit up! He said they looked exactly like the ones he makes. But the real compliment came when he tried them. He said this is authentic Mexican! It's one thing coming from a gringo like me. But you know it's good when a native Mexican tells you so! You can't get a much better compliment than that! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It's definitely a keeper as written!",
