I substituted nutmeg in for the cloves because it was what I had. We thought it was good but missing something and decided that it needed black pepper. I served the pork chop on top of a pile of quinoa and spooned the sauce over it all. I would definitely try this again but next time I would try something to combat/balance a bit of the tartness. Fun to try and yummy!",

Used chicken broth sprayed with Brach's Amino Acids no vinegar or brown sugar 2 whole cloves vs. ground. Added leftover pork and chicken to pan to heat. Already cooked rice noodles so added at end to heat. Served with cabbage and greens fried in 1 t. bacon grease and sundried tomatoes. So much better than boring soy sauce by itself on noodles.",

There isn't a ton of sauce just enough to coat the pork chops. I think fresh ginger would be a good addition instead of the ground ginger.",
