I know where I can buy pancetta at but it was too far away and I was feeling lazy. So, I used thick bacon. I, like chef John in the video, used whole wheat spaghetti. I enjoyed this simple dish even though I messed up a little and my cream curdled a bit. I didn't lower my heat as low as I should have and I didn't constantly stir. So, do as Chef John said!!! :o)",

                "reviewBody": "Spaghetti alla Carbonara is not difficult to make and requires just a few simple, but standard, required ingredients.  It really does not vary much from one recipe to the next.  This recipe is a fundamental, basic reference recipe.  I find it a little easier to mix the (room temperature) egg and cheese in a bowl and then add the cooked pasta to that mixture (rather than the other way around).  I stir in the cooked meat, be it guanciale, pancetta or bacon, at the end.  Add a little of the pasta cooking water if the sauce seems a little dry \u2013 the dish should be creamy, but not swimming in sauce.   I just returned from Italy, where I was lucky enough to enjoy this pasta dish with guanciale, which comes from the jowls of the pig.  I admit it sounded unappealing when I first tried it years ago, but only because it was unfamiliar.  It is the best and by comparison neither pancetta nor bacon measure up.  Unfortunately, it is hard to find here in the states. In its absence I\u2019ve used pancetta, as I did tonight, other times bacon, and I have to say that if I can\u2019t have this with guanciale I prefer bacon over the pancetta.  I found this recipe a little heavy on the cheese for my taste, so I backed off on it by about one-third.  Nothing innovative about this recipe \u2013 but because this is a classic dish, it shouldn\u2019t be.",

                "reviewBody": "I'm half Italian and have been living here for over 28 years. So I can fully guarantee that the above recipe is correct. Hence the 5 stars. However there is a small cooking trick that we do here in Italy to make sure that the sauce is creamy and that the eggs don't curdle. First we only use the yellow of the eggs inorder to make the egg taste not so strong (you may use the whole egg if you want). Second you should beat the egg and mix a part of the grated cheese together and then add a couple of spoonfools of the pasta water while the pasta is boiling to this mixture. The pasta water will help make this mixture creamy. When you add the egg mixture it should be done on either a very low heat or even better off the stove. If necessary add extra pasta water. All the rest remains the same... ingredients ect... hope this helps it works for me now my pasta is never dry",
