If you like your green beans with a bit of snap to them, I highly recommend cooking only half the stated time. I found them perfectly done at 4 minutes. I also didn't find they needed 5 minutes in the pan as they were still warm when I added them; 2 minutes to toss and coat everything evenly was plenty. I loved the flavor of the garlic and toasted almonds. A great combo that I will make again!",
