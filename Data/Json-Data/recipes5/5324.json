I've been eating cucumber/tomato salad (Lebanese style) for many years, and this recipe captures the  flavor and texture of those I have had in upsale middle eastern restaurants.  Sometimes I add crumbles of pita bread that has been smeared thinlhy with an olive oil garlic spread, then toasted crisp.  This salad tastes great as a side dish, stuffed into pita with some feta cheese added, or as topping for a lettuce salad.  Also tastes great as a relish (cut all pieces very small) to add flavor to gyros  or roasted savory chicken.",
