Still, needs something else.\" Sauce is never the thing on a pizza that makes my stomach sing; sauce is like crust lube to me - the equivalent of mayo or mustard to a sandwich. Still, I was making pizzas a couple nights ago and wanted to try a new sauce recipe out, so I gave this one a go, and followed it exactly, except halving it, which incidentally, just covered a single large pizza. I was perplexed at not first sauteeing the garlic (or, should I make it again, diced onions and bell peppers too) in olive oil first, rather than just dumping everything into a collective simmer. I also found it unusual to add all of those dried spices, along w/ Italian Seasoning, which, for the most part, is made up of said spices, but again, I followed the recipe to the letter. Gave it a lick after 30 min. and added (as the author suggested) a bit more brown sugar, along w/ some finely-chopped fresh rosemary. I left half my pizza plain cheese so I could get a taste for the sauce in its completed pizza glory, and the other half (*drool*), I piled w/ grilled chicken, spinach, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, carmelized onions, and leftover hunks of \"Pinwheel Meatloaf\" (AR) and, well, for me, pizza's all about the toppings; however, this sauce WAS a nice change from store-bought sauce, and I'd make it again w/ my proposed modifications.",

It was GREAT.\n\nMy changes were to add a tsp of honey, 2 tsp crushed fennel seeds, and to saute the garlic (and a little bit of the crushed red pepper) in the oil for a minute or two before adding the rest of the ingredients. \n\nThank you so much for this recipe because it will save me hundreds in shipping costs alone :)",

It is very rich in flavor though so it can easily take over as a dominant flavor though so it won't just go with everything. Great though overall.
