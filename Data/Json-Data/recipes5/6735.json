Additionally, I only had smoked paprika on hand and used that. This soup was out-of-this-world delicious! The wild rice early sucks up the broth as it cooks, and even though I began with 2  qts of broth, between the rice and lost steam, I ended up adding another 1.5 qts of broth.  I will probably precook the rice next time and then dump in the already cooked rice. We will definitely have this again, it is one of my best soups ever!",

The soup doesn't really bring out the chanterelle flavor and the amount of soy sauce and ground pepper collide with each other strongly and kill the flavor of the mushroom. I'm trying to save it by diluting it and mixing in some cream and flour and putting a chunk of the soup in the blender. It's hard to neutralize the saltiness and pepperiness.",
