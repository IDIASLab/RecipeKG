Pork is thinly sliced and stir-fried with bell peppers, celery, and Brussels sprouts.

I thought the recipe would have a much better flavor with soy sauce so I steadily mixed that in a few times throughout the cooking time. I left out the mint ginger root and the whole garlic cloves but I got some minced garlic 'powder' and went slightly heavy on that instead. Otherwise I followed everything pretty much as the recipe says. Myself and my partner both LOVED it. Really the soy sauce set it off real nice.",
