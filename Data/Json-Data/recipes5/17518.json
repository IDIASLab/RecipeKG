I began making them for other potluck events. Now all my invites to such parties are conditioned with a \"as long as you bring your famous cocktail wieners\". I am repeatedly asked for the recipe. Again the sauce is what is to rave about with this recipe. In the end the cocktail wieners almost serve simply as a means to an end; eating the sauce.:) For something different try substituting small pieces of (cooked) chicken breast; this is also a yummy treat. I have also slow cooked chicken breasts in this sauce for an amazingly tasty main dish. This is an easy to make recipe with fantastic results. As other reviewers have said the key is to slow cook it. The longer the better. While the actual cook time is long the actual prep time and \"in the kitchen\" time is very minimal. You must give it a try. A note on what sizes of items to purchase if you do not want any extras; a 12oz jar of Red Currant Jelly is exactly 1 cup. A 12oz bottle of Dijon mustard is a little bit more then the 1 cup you will need. A 10oz bottle would probably be the perfect size but I have never found one.",

SO easy to make I had to quadruple this recipe an hour into my party they were all wiped out - and none were left after 3 more servings were made! I found the red current jelly at Albertson's. The longer they cook the better they taste and the musard really cools off and the flavors combine nicely after a few hours in the cooker. I will DEFINITELY make these again they were the hit of the party!",

I thought they were very good and my wife finished them off as soon as she walked in the door. If they're a hit tomorrow I'll edit this. Edit: They were a huge hit with almost all 8 lbs disappearing.
