I used my own dough recipe and baked it in the oven at 525F before then putting it under the broiler briefly because I like to get the cheese and top crust a little browned.  Make sure you drain the ingredients well so that the crust doesn't get soggy in the middle.  This makes a nice summer dinner but would also be good for an appetizer.",

I used kalamata olives instead of plain black olives. I added capers and just a tiny bit of minced jalapeno peppers. I eliminated the onion because I don't tolerate onion well but I'm sure it would be delicious. I also used individual pizza crusts that I purchased (5 in a bag). To serve as an appetizer I cut each individual pizza into eight slices. This was so easy! I chopped and mixed up all the ingredients in the early morning and when it was \"show time\" I had these out on the table in 15 minutes!",
