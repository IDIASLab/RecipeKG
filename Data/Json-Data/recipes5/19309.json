First, I happened to have made this last night and forgot the soy sauce until just before serving.  I have to say I liked it better WITHOUT it.  Something about the soy sauce took over some of the other flavors - particularly the sweetness.  I might recommend tasting before adding the soy sauce and if you like it, stop there.  \n\nSecondly, if you cook with it - for example stir fry some chicken chunks with this sauce - the sweetness mysteriously goes away.  Better to add the sauce to already cooked food.  Despite the \"use immediately\" note, you can make this first and warm up quickly in the microwave just before plating - do it in as many 10 second runs as needed.",

Here's what I did...I took about 20 dried red chilies after shaking out the seeds and taking off the stems soaked them in hot water for about 20 minutes. Then rinsed. Put them in a pot of boiling water for about 40 minutes. Took out the chilies and put them into a food processor with 3 cups of the chili water and blended it until it was pulp like. Put the mixture into a big fry pan and added the garlic vinegar soy sauce fish sauce and brown sugar (amounts not measured) and cooked it until it boiled. Then I put the mixture back into the food processor with the lime juice (a half of a lime) cilantro and green onion and blended it until it was smooth. LOVE THIS RECIPE! I'm making Pasole tomorrow and will use this as my base mix. Thanks so much for sharing and all the great comments.",

I did have oyster sauce,  so I used it and backed off the brown sugar.  the result was spectacular! I  used it on vegetables and on sliced turkey.
