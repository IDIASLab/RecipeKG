I did leave out the lemon zest and added a clove of garlic, and sprinkled just a hint of nutmeg over top wit the sweet paprika and parsely (which I did NOT use the whole amount the recipe calls for).  The taste was well-rounded and good.  I will say the sage was a bit over powering, and although I love sage, I will use less next time.  \r\nOverall, though a good one.  I'd also want a few more mushroom next time...but good, solid recipe!!",

(30 minutes kills them) Making the cream sauce / roux was a snap. I even used potato starch instead of wheat flour. Everything was delicious till I added the lemon juice. The sauce tried to curdle into tiny lumps. The lemon was supposed to thicken or add flavor? The lemony taste did not pair well with the sage and mushrooms. I think this would be a great recipe made with fresh sage Half and Half and no lemon.",

I have made them for well over 45 years and never thought of having Sage in them which seems to be a natural as it works with the sage in the dressing. I do use frozen pearl onions (cook for half the time) and I make it a day or two ahead and heat while the turkey sets. I also never thought about adding mushrooms and will try that also. The lemon I will probably omit. Love to read the way others treat a pretty standard recipe and this one is a winner.",

I prepared with frozen pearl onions just boiled about 6 minutes or so per package directions and made the sauce as written.

I prepared a day in advance refrigerated and baked 350 for about 40 minutes or so before serving. Tasty and received rave reviews. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",
