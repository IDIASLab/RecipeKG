They've been a Christmas tradition for as long as he can remember (as a boy and he's over 50 now lol). They are loved by all the trick it to cut them very very small so that the sweetness is not overpowering. The joke in this family is that they were often made and frozen to have for Christmas but the boys would get into the freezer and none would be left by Christmas. Today they still eat them frozen half the time... give it a try! Glad to see this recipe on here!",
