I found with the bacon, these didn't need any added salt. I enjoyed them fresh out of the oven, however reheated they were just ok. Very simple to make for a crowd. I baked mine for 20 mins in silicone molds, however next time I would maybe do 17-18 as the bottoms were getting a little too done for my tastes.",
