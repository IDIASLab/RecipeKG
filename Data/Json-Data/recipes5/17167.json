I devoured one loaf in just a day by myself.  Next time I will try all applesauce for the oil and more whole wheat flour for the white flour.",

He enjoyed the bread so much, he would not share it. I added half of the cinnamon to the bread batter and the other half to the topping mixture and I thought that added just the right amount of spice to the bread batter. I will be making this again as Mother's Day gifts and as a \"Welcome to the Neighborhood\" gift for our new neighbors. Thanks for a great recipe!",

I increased the rhubarb to 2 c (next time I'll use 2.5) and used almonds instead of walnuts. I added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter and some oats to the topping mixture, it was the perfect touch. This bread held up well at room temperature for several days, retaining its moisture and never tasting stale. Next time I'll add grated lemon rind and maybe replace some of the oil with yoghurt, it was possibly a bit greasy.",

The topping sort of sinks into the bread making it look like it has little craters, or kind of a pebbly looking top.  And it slices a little crumbly, althoughI barely waited until it was cooled, let alone chilled.  I substituted a cup of buttermilk for the milk and lemon juice and kind of wish I would have left out the nuts as their presence was a little too prominent for me.  So why the three stars and not higher?  The baking time is WAY off, and frankly, with nearly 200 reviews, I'm surprised no one else has commented on this.  Forty minutes?  No way.  I baked this in a Pyrex 8x4\" loaf pan at 325 degrees, for about 55-60 minutes, which is fairly typical for most quick breads.",

I love the sourness of the rhubard with the sweetness of the bread. It's a good thing it makes 2 loaves because the 1st on is almost all gone!
