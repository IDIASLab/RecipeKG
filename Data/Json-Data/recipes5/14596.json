I just mashed the beans instead of using the immersion blender because we do like some texture. I felt as written it could use more salt or seasoning. I ended up adding a little Rotel and continued to mash. It did seem like there was too much liquid, but let it sit as Soup Loving Nicole indicated in her review and the beans were perfect. Thanks for the recipe!",

We like our refried beans a little chunky, so I didn\u2019t blend them until totally smooth. The only change I made was substituting one teaspoon of the salt with a teaspoon of Goya\u00ae Adobo Seasoning (one of my favorites for Latin recipes) which really elevated the flavor.  Also, we\u2019re pepper fans, so I did give these beans a pretty healthy grind of fresh peppercorns.  They turned out delicious, and this was so very easy!  I love finding recipes for my Instant Pot\u00ae that are outstanding, and these beans are in that category!",

I brought it to dinner for the family where Taco's were being served. Everyone gave me compliments and I enjoyed the dish also. Good flavor and not too spicy if following the recipe.
