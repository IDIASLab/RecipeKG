Try a filling of 2 qts softened vanilla ice cream (lowfat is fine)mixed with a 12-oz can lemonade or limeade, slightly thawed. I used the Kitchen-Aid paddle attachment to mix them so they're real smooth. Pour filling into cooled 13x9 pretzel crust, then freeze until firm. Sprinkle a slight handful of toasted pretzel crust mixture over the top just before serving for a nice garnish and extra crunch. Most refreshing pie in the WORLD.

However, if you bake in the 9x13 baking dish, it gets difficult to transfer to a pie pan...therefore, just fill the pie plans you wish to use with it and bake.  Also, I don't bake for the full 10 minutes...only 6-8 minutes, which doesn't sound like much of a difference but 10 minutes (for me anyways) always results in a too tough pie crust.  Baking a few minutes less makes the finished pie easier to cut and serve.",
