This is what made me want to try his recipe over others.\n\nI also like that in his recipe, he doesn't skimp on the Louisiana  andouille (pronounced an-du-ae - the ll's are silent) sausage.  It really makes the right smokey-hot flavor for this dish.   Good andouille tends to be expensive,  and an economy version will just be called \"hot smoked sausage\" links such as Bar-S or Morell. (Do not use polish Kielbasa - totally wrong flavor.)\n\nAlso, there is a difference between \"red beans\" and \"kidney beans\".  It is the actual name for a particular type of bean - not just a color. Kidney beans may also be red, but they have a different flavor than \"red beans\".  Here on the west coast, I can always find dried red beans at Safeway, and Walmart sells canned red beans.\n\nI serve with greens (\"the recipe here for \"Kickin Collard Greens is my favorite), some cornbread, and sweet tea.\n\nLove your recipe for this classic dish, Chef John!  5 STARS!",

                "reviewBody": "My first time EVER making red beans and rice, and this was the recipe I chose. I served it with homemade corn bread (also in AR - search for Grandma's Cornbread) \n\nHow mine differed:\n1. Used a ham shank instead of a hock. \n\n2. I forgot bay leaves. \n\n3. Skipped the hot sauce.\n\n4. Used pasillo peppers.\n\n5. Used 14oz of regular old Johnsonville sausage w/pork, beef, turkey, and whatever else is in it.\n\nTHE VERDICT! \n\nPros: \n1. I hate spicy food (and also have a toddler) so my milder version was perfect for us. \n\n2. My house smelled like Louisiana all day. \n\n3. Extremely filling! \n\n4. Huge amount of food and very cheap ingredients!\n\n5. Leftovers! This recipe will feed my family of 2 and a toddler for days! \n\nCons:\n1. It took about 4 hours total, so my gas stove was on most of the day and someone had to stay home to man the kitchen. Would have preferred to use a slow cooker, but it gave me a solid excuse to watch football all day. (Also, the toddler can reach those knobs. Luckily, she's an obedient one with no early signs of pyromania.) \n\n2. Can't give the cooked ham bone to my dog, so she was disappointed about that. \n\nOverall, it's absolutely delicious. If you have several hours to spare and don't want to cook again for a week (or if you need to feed 10 lumberjacks), this is the recipe for you!",

At first, I thought I had too much liquid, but I let it cook down a bit without the lid.  I put the lid back on and just let it simmer.  It began to thicken and became perfection.  I can't wait to make this for others...maybe my Superbowl party.  I did not use any hot sauce.  I'm not a spicy person.  Even without it, my husband says it has a nice kick to it.  I also added two chicken bouillon cubes for added flavor, so I actually added very little table salt.  Chef John has made me look good, once again!!\n\nIt did not explicitly tell you when to add the beans...add it with the broth.",

I substituted canned red beans rather than soaking beans overnight. I rinsed them first. Worked great. Once all the ingredients were added to my pot, I boiled them for about 75-80 minute. (A lot less than the original recipe calls for.)  We all felt the flavors had cooked well together in that short amount of time. About 1/2 way through the cooking time,  I mashed the beans down inside the pot.  For whatever reason, that really made a nice difference in taste and texture. Loved it!

I made it in the crockpot - I soaked the beans overnight, drained and rinsed in the morning, chopped and saut\u00e9ed the other ingredients  according to instructions, added them to the crockpot, then let it simmer on low all day and then cooked on high for the last hour or so just to make sure the beans were cooked all the way. I served it with brown rice. Thanks Chef John for such an amazing recipe! I\u2019m glad for another crockpot meal. I\u2019ll be making this again for sure.",
