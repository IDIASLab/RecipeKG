I like mine extra garlicky and go for the full 6 cloves, but it's plenty flavorful with less. You can use just about any veggies or meat in this recipe and it will still be great. I use all frozen veggies so I only need to shop for tomatoes, and even those I could use canned if I feel lazy, making this a true from-the-pantry meal with no shopping required.",

I added some Italian seasonings and some Italian cheese! I used the 6 cloves of garlic and I also added extra red chili flakes! I used canned tomatoes because I have them home canned. \n\nSomeone mentioned the meat was bland and that can be easily remedied by adding the Italian seasoning, salt and pepper along with the red chili flakes to the meat while it is saut\u00e9ing!
