I was bent on not having to go to the store for ingredients....I didn't have allspice so I used nutmeg and cloves (which I removed after the sauce was cooked). Also I didn't have apple juice so I used apple sauce instead. Lastly adding salt to the recipe made the casserole taste more like a side dish (my family loves dessert so they would've been easily confused!). Great recipe all in all...I received comments like \"better than Marie Calendar's yams!\"",
