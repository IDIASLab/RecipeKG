I used lemon pudding instead of lemon gelatin like some reviewers suggested.  Also, instead of poking holes in the cake so that the glaze could saturate the cake (like the recipe calls for) I poured it over the top.  The change I would make to the recipe would be to poke holes in the cake and pour the glaze into the holes like the recipe calls for.  This probably makes it REALLY lemony.  Then, I would pour a regular glaze over the cake.  This would make it perfect in my book.  By the way, for those of you wondering what apricot nectar is, it is apricot juice.  You can usually find a can of it in the juice aisle.  Libby's makes it and I am sure that others do as well.",

My husband ate the remaining leftover piece the next day. I made it the day before and then put it in the fridge overnight and I think it intensifies the lemon. I don't like buying obscure ingredients so I used orange juice in place of the apricot nectar. Great texture. I also did as suggested by another reviewer and poked holes (with a skewer) around in the bottom of the cake while it was still in the bunt pan just out of the oven to pour the glaze in and then let it cool about 20 mins before removing it from the pan. Another tip for baking with bunt pans I read: instead of flouring your greased pan and having the white dust show when you take your cake out make a paste with 1 Tbl melted butter and 1 Tbl flour and then brush it on your pan with a basting brush. Your cake will come right out and look pretty too.",
