The recipe turned out great as is even with the cocoa mole twist which I wasn't too sure about. I'm sure one can also use other game meat in here like venison and keep the nutritional profile basically the same. Thanks I'll keep this one in my recipe box.",

I especially liked the addition of the spinach & mushrooms and may just incorporate that into my regular lasagna recipe. I left out the cocoa and brown sugar. It just sounded like an odd combination of flavors and I ve never had a problem with moose tasting gamey. If I ever run into a strong game meat I will try that little trick and see if it reduces the gaminess.",
