The marinade is wonderfully fragrant and the finished chicken would be delicious on its own. The sweet taste of pineapple and raisins added to the overall exotic quality of the salad. The dressing is a perked-up version of honey mustard. I didn't toss everything together as the submitter suggested and I'm glad I didn't because now I have some extra of that yummy dressing. DH has said that he doesn't care for curry but he certainly scarfed this salad down as I did. Thanks for the idea!",

I'm not sure about the honey mustard dressing. I bought honey mustard dipping sauce because I couldn't find anything labeled \"dressing\". My version turned out really thick so I added some oil before refrigerating and then just before serving it was really REALLY thick so added some water. But not sure if it was the type of greens I had (spring mix) or what but the dressing really weighed the greens down and they wilted under the dressing. However having said that it tasted WONDERFUL! I will absolutely make this again and see if I can find the proper honey mustard dressing or make my own. And maybe use a hardier green like romaine. Hubby actually came close to saying he felt like there was a party in his mouth that's how much he loved it. Very very flavorful. Thanks for posting this awesome recipe.",
