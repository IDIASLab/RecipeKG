I used 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, and I ommitted the lemon juice and sherry and used 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar to get the sour tang. I also used honey instead of corn syrup. (better for you in my opinion) because I ommitted so much mine was pretty thick so it needed extra water. I also like super spicy so I added a teaspoon of hot curry in addition to the cayenne. Yummy! Great over rice noodles!",

I was glad that I used low sodium soy sauce because it might have been salty otherwise. I also added a little bit of coconut milk as I had some on hand. My boyfriend said of the meal: this doesn't taste like something you eat at home! I would have paid money for it too! So totally delicious. Thanks for sharing! EDIT: I now make this with cream of coconut instead of corn syrup. It is delicious!",
