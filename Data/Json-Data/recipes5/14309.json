I didn't have any chilis though so I felt like it might have been missing something. The dish was kind of overpowered by the cilantro. But both me and my boyfriend really enjoyed it and will probably make it again. Thanks! Substitutions: Doubled the garlic used sunflower oil instead of peanut didn't use any fish sauce chilis or ground white pepper and used chives in place of spring green onion.",
