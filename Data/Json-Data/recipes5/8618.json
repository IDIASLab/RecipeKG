They say this recipe was brought to Baltimore by German immigrants, who apparently used to top it with caramelized onions. I don't know about onions, but any ripe, sweet fruit should work in this. Serve with ice cream if desired.",

I will pick up peaches tomorrow for this recipe. I know from the ingredients that this is the real McCoy. Do try using plums (prune plums, black or red plums) instead of peaches.  Also use apples--add a sprinkling of cinnamon to the sugar sprinkled over the fruit. The bakery also made cinnamon cake (sugar/cinnamon topping), crumb cake (streusel topping), smearkase (sp?) a cheesecake filling for the seasons when fresh fruit was not available. The  general term for these was \"sheet cakes.\" A dollop of whipped cream and a pot of coffee would not be remiss........das goot!",

I should have spread it out in a jelly roll pan as the Peach Cake I grew up with in Baltimore was cut in approx. 6x8 inch  thin rectangles from a large flat pan.  I have tried several recipes sorta playing on the same theme and they are all too thick.  I am curious if anyone has really tried these recipes who knows how Baltimore Peach Cake is suppose to be. Next year I shall try again with my jelly roll pan. I did break my fear of baking with yeast.  Simons Bakery in Cockeysville is still selling their marvelous perfect authentic peach cake.  Chef John maybe you could treat yourself and try Simons.  The Best!!!!!  Thank you for the great video.  It helped me know what I was doing was correct with the sticky think dough resulting.",
