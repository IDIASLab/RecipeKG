I had some spareribs and NO clue how to cook them so here comes AR;) The combination of ingredients (and the fact that it's unrated) worried me a little but I went with it and I'm very pleasantly surprised! I generally don't like nutmeg in savory dishes but after the long cooking time you can't pick it out amongst the other ingredients - everything blends nicely so that you can't pick out any one flavor. Very good recipe thanks!",

I made the sauce exactly w/ no modifications and followed Staschy's general method for cooking and the ribs fell off the bone in wonderful tenderness when done. Here's how: boiled the ribs in large pot of water 45 minutes. Made sauce exactly in dutch oven. Didn't brown the ribs just put them directly in with sauce once sauce was made. Put lid on dutch oven cooked 2 hours covered at 250 1 hour covered at 300 45 minutes uncovered at 350. The ribs fell off bone as took them out with tongs had to use a spatula to support underneath to get the rack on a plate w/o meat falling off further. The sauce is a wonderful rich vinegar-based sauce. It was effortless to separate the meat from bone shredded it then plunged eat bite into the sauce before eating. My 9-y.o. daughter said she could literally eat this dish every meal for the rest of her life.:-) I would pay good money at a restaurant for ribs this delicious tender and tasty. Make them this way and you'll say the same.",

I never boil my ribs first as the flavour comes out into the water (thats why you boil vegetables and meat in water to make soup!).  I just browned these quickly and threw into the slow-cooker.  I made up the sauce as listed PLUS some garlic and poured it in.  Turned it on HIGH for 6 hours, but they were perfect after only 4.\r\n\r\nI am only rating this a 4 because we thought the sauce was a little bland.  When I make it again, I will use more brown sugar.  \r\n\r\nMy kids thought it was a little plain as well, so I zipped up some honey garlic sauce, coated the ribs and placed in the oven to get all sticky. The base flavour from the original recipe made these just wonderful!  (which is what I am rating).  The addition of honey garlic sauce to that already base flavour made it a 5 star in our house!  Thanks for this recipe!\r\n\r\nGo ahead and let this cook in your slow cooker all day for a perfect dinner when you get home!",
