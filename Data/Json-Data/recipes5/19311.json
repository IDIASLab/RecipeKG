It's a little too strong.  overall it was very good.  I fixed new potatoes with mine in the same pan.",

Reduced salt to 1 1/2 tsp (will try a bit less next time as well) 3. Made GRAVY from the juices. I sprinkled 40% of the rub on the bottom of 12 chicken thighs the rest on the rest on the skin side. After baking I removed the fat from the juices and made a quick gray (just added some flour to thicken). We ate it with green beans and rice. The gravy was heavenly and made the dish perfect.",
