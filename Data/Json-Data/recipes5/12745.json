We use yellow cake mix and an enitre can of pumpkin (which was a mistake originally)....it is so much more moist!  We also top it with an orange glaze. It really makes a big difference. The orange blends so well with the other flavors. Just use confectioners sugar, melted butter, orange zest and a bit of milk and drizzle on once its cooled. You will make it this way every time! This has been a family tradition for over 60 years and I am glad to see other families enjoying it too!",

I took it to work for a potluck and there was a ton of food there and this was gone in 30 minutes. I now have to bring another one in next week as several people did not get to try it!
