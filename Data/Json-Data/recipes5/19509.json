This is much easier when making a large Christmas dinner. I was VERY worried how it would taste the brown sugar part was making everyone make faces. So I took the suggestion of others and halved the brown sugar. As I was worried about the sauce permeating through all the beans I also added 50% more sauce. Turns out this second part was not needed but taking the brown sugar down by half was. IT WAS PERFECT. Everyone LOVED it. The only other changes I made was that I did cut the bacon into smaller pieces before microwaving but I still layed it on top and used enough to cover the beans. I also used frozen beans and 4 bags worked well. We will definitely be using this recipe again!",

Used only 5 tsp soya 7 would have been too much. Used one clove fresh minced garlic; that was good. Overall these beans had a nice flavour but they were overcooked too sweet and too greasy. If I tried this recipe again I would make the sauce with less sugar less soya and less butter I would steam the beans cook the bacon with the garlic make the sauce and pour it over the cooked beans.
