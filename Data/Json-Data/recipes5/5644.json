The only change I made was to sub zucchini and green pepper for the carrots and peas (I had some from my garden that I needed to use up) but it was the sauce I wasn't crazy about. It was fairly bitter and it didn't highlight the sweetness of the scallops at all. My 19-month-old ate it with no complaints though.",
