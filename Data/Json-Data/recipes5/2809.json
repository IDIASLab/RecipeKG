I used only half the amount of lemon juice (and added some zest to replace lost lemon flavor) and it still was thinner than I would have liked. And, as others have remarked, it really is too sweet. By the time I manipulated the sugar and juice measurements and added lemon zest, I really wasn't making this recipe anymore. Since I was using this to pipe on cupcakes and needed a sturdier frosting, rather than add more confectioners sugar I added a couple teaspoons of meringue powder, which helped. If I was to make this in the future I would still use only 1 T. of lemon juice, and perhaps double the cream cheese.",

The cookie was OK without the frosting but was just devine with this frosting. It's nice and tangy with the fresh lemon. Much better than using lemon extract only. The cream cheese imparts a perfectly compatible tang. Could be used to dress up a plain vanilla cake or on an orange cake. Can be used as a glaze by thinning it out a bit with drops of milk. Versatile and delicious.",
