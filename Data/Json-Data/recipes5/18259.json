I used boneless skinless chicken breasts...grilled 8 minutes on each side. They were so juicy and yummy! I ate mine with brown rice & corn on the cob. My husband ate later in the day so his were cold over salad and he said they were delicious. This recipe is a keeper!",

I halved this used a Good Seasons Italian Dressing packet added the ingredients called for here then added the liquids called for plus a 1/2 cup water then I drizzled in the oil (called for on the package) and mixed with an emmulsion blender to emulsify. After marinating I boiled a cup of the marinade and basted with it. Be sure to grill over indirect heat even then the skin may blacken but the chicken will be tender and moist. Take off the grill baste lightly one last time cover with foil and let rest 10 minutes before serving. Oh so good!!",
