Firstly, I cannot believe someone tried to make this without cooking the meat first--I was under the impression that was Cooking 101 common sense. Secondly I substituted Cream of Chicken for the Celery, I also added half of a chopped onion and garlic powder in lieu of garlic. After cooking the ground beef and onion, I mixed it with both of the soup mixtures and 1 cup of 2% milk. I then layered mild cheddar cheese on top of that and then on the very top I put the frozen tater tots. There is no need to thaw them. I baked it at 375 for 60 minutes. The tater tots were nice and crispy with cheese oozing around them--and it was absolutely delicious. I am making it tonight, for the second time in two weeks. I will definitely make it again---and again.",
