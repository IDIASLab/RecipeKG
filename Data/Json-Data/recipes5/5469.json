I made as stated except I cubed some chicken breast and sauteed it in the pot beforehand. I also combined all the seasonings and mixed about a teaspoon in with the onions while they cooked to enhance the flavor (and added the remainder of the spices in as per the recipe). Gave this four stars as both the hubby and I thought the soup could have used a little more \"oomph\" (the coconut milk may have toned the flavors down a little). But definitely worth making again!",

After the fire subsided a bit the second flavor that hit us was the overwhelming lemon. I'm giving this recipe three stars because I appreciate the effort and experimentation that went into it. I certainly couldn't have come up with this from scratch. I think it has a lot of promise so I'm going to try it again with a few substitutions. I'll use just a dash or two of lime or lemon juice 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and maybe just a bit of oyster sauce. Thank you for sharing your recipe!",
