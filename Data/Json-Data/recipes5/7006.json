I beat all soft ingredients with a hand mixer before incorporating the trout and the onion.  I was pleased with the consistency.  I also used two green onions instead of one and garnished with chives.  I think these changes improved on the recipe based on prior reviews.  I will make it again, next time with smoked paprika instead of regular.",
