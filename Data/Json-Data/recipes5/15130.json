I also used light cream cheese and fat free Cool Whip. To the cool whip/cream cheese mixture I still added the vanilla extract but also added some sugar free vanilla pudding mix (just the powder). It makes it even better! I also layered the pie-bottom with cream cheese mixture topped with \"light\" cherry pie filling another lay er of cream cheese and finished off with a top layer of cherries! If you love cherries and do the layering technique--I would suggest 2 cans of cherry pie filling. All in all--recipe was awesome! Boyfriend and I loved it! Perfect Valentine's Day dessert!",

                "reviewBody": "I followed the recipe as directed only using reduced fat cream cheese and \"free\" whipped topping. I also made my own crust and strawberry topping. WAY too sweet for us. I think this would be much better as a frozen pie without the topping. As it was the filling was goopy and flavor-wise it was like melted soft-serve. It was a quick pie (after my cupcakes bombed) that could be made lighter and more personal but it just wasn't a hit with us. NOTE: And so my review isn't misunderstood I've made pies like this with fat free ingredients and had a good outcome. I think what my issue could have been was the confectioners sugar. When I make this with granulated sugar I don't have that issue. It's like whipping butter with sugar it fills with air and \"puffs\". This didn't do that. It was gloppy and overly sweet. Maybe too much of the confectioners sugar?",
