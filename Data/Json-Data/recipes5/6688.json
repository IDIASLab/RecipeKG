The cardamom I didn\u2019t have so I looked up a replacement and found cardamom is half nutmeg and half cinnamon so I did that.  I used jarred garlic and ginger spice (not fresh).  I added this to the cooked onions while they were hot and then scraped all into the lentils.  I let cool and pur\u00e9e in my food processor.    It is good!
