I would just use peanuts, throwing them in with the potatoes or at the end, and maybe peanut oil to fry it all up with.",

While I approached the called-for addition of 1/3 c. peanut butter with some skepticism I added it anyway. I should have stuck with my instinct - Massaman Curry isn't supposed be this thick! This tastes like Peanut Butter Stew! The flavor is decent but it's NOT at all what I expected. I recommend starting with half the peanut butter that's called-for and evaluating the consistency after 5 to 10 minutes. The dish will thicken a bit as it cools so take that into consideration too. On a personal note I prefer a \"soupier\" massaman curry so in addition to reducing the peanut butter I would also reduce the amount of potatoes to 2 cups from 3c. I would also add 1/2 cup of minced onions for dimensional interest. I will probably use water to thin out the leftovers from last night. This was much better after adding water to thin to my liking. When I added water I also added more lime juice to balance the taste.",

I could not find tamarind paste but a quick check online says that Worcestershire sauce is a substitute. I accidentally bought chicken breasts that were pre-flattened for scaloppine which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. They cooked up a lot better than regular chicken breasts and did not dry out. I also added a can of peas because that is what our local Thai restaurant puts in their Massaman. Once everything was cooked I added the peas in and let it sit for a few minutes so they could heat up. Oh! And I added some pepper flakes because we like it spicy. My only complaint is that there was too much potato. I will only use 1 potato next time. Thanks!",

It was AWESOME. My whole family loved it, especially my husband who ate the leftovers for lunch TWICE!! This is a huge compliment as I can rarely entice him to leftovers for lunch.
