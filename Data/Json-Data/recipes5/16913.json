The only change I made was to put the bananas in a foil packet on the grill instead of directly on the grate (campsite fire-ring grate was pretty nasty looking). The bananas were done perfectly and by putting it in a foil pack we had all the wonderful juices to use as a syrup over ice cream. Even better the few leftovers that were remaining we used as a fruit topping to the \"Baked French Toast\" casserole (also on allrecipes)the next morning. Delicious. Made the mess once enjoyed it twice!!! Will definitely make this again.",
