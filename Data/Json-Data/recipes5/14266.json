My husband took some of this to his work and his coworkers raved about it and couldn't believe it was homemade. I like my salsas milder so this one fit the bill. We doubled the recipe and got 64 ounces (fitting nicely into four 16 oz. canning jars). It is very limey...so make sure you like that flavor before using a whole lime. Thanks for the tasty alternative to store bought!!",

I had to add a can of tomato sauce to help with the acidity it was missing and I also used a food processor since I like my salsa pureed more. If I make this again I will cut down on the serrano peppers and add a can of roasted tomatoes.",
