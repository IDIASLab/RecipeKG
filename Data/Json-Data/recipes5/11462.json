Here's how we made a recipe that we liked (and so did our family): \n\n1. Cut the celery into small pieces and use two sticks instead of the one it calls for (this way, every bite has crunch) \n\n2. We usually prefer green onions over red, white, yellow, etc. But in this case, we found that the extra crunch added by these varieties are essential. We used white onions instead of green, and that made a world of difference. Make sure to mince or dice very small; again, to get some onion in every bite. Eliminate the onion powder.\n\n3. It was too vinegar-y for our taste, so we cut the vinegar down to 1/2 cup and that yielded a better balance with the oil. \n\n4. Use olive oil, not veg oil\n\n5. Use real minced garlic instead of garlic powder\n\n6. Add salt\n\n7. store the salad in tupperware that you can flip upside down, without leakage. Rotate it at least twice during the marination process.\n\n8. After the salad has had a chance to marinate over night, drain off the excess dressing; otherwise the beans at the bottom will start to degrade.\n\nThis sounds like more work than it is, and trust me the result is well worth it!",

The dressing is perfect; not too sweet just the right tang and the cayenne adds just the right amount of heat. This has definitely become my favorite.",
