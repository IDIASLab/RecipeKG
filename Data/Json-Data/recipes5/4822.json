But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!! I loved the flavors of the cucumber sauce and the bbq coated swordfish. The only thing I did different and only because I did not have an onion was that I used a shallot instead. I will be posting pics on my page tonight. Great recipe awesome flavor and it does not overpower that delicious swordfish flavor. Thanks Cyndi! (and keni for the suggestion!)",

For my marinade I used olive oil and sesame oil minced onion and garlic. Added Lemon Thyme Herbes de Provence a dash of Lemon Pepper seasoning onion powder and salt and pepper. Grilled for 4 minutes then turned 45 degrees to enhance grill marks and cooked 2 minutes longer. Flipped and cooked another 2-3 minutes covered with foil while I was getting the rest of our meal finished. Served this with a Zucchini and Corn Medley and it was a perfect summer meal.",
