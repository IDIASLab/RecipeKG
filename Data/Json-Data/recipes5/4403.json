It can be used as a condiment on grilled meats, as a salad dressing, and in dishes that require good garlic flavor. We have found immersion blending works much better than using the blender. If you double the batch, don't double the salt, rather use 1 1/2 tablespoons.",

It tastes just like the sauce at our favorite Middle Eastern restaurant.  I did make a few changes.  Here is the recipe with my alterations:\n\n    * 1 head garlic\n    * 1/2 tablespoon sea salt (make sure it is course-ground or this will still be too much salt)\n    * 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice\n    * 1/2 cup vegetable oil\n    * 3/4 cup olive oil (not extra virgin - mild-tasting, preferably cold-pressed)\n\nSo, less salt and less oil.  Also, I believe the immersion blender is key here to emulsify the oil to the proper consistency.  Loved it! Thank you for the recipe!\n\n",

Thank you to the reviewer who suggested the addition of an egg white to thicken it if you're looking for something similar to what you find in the Detroit area.  I'm a Detroit-area native living out of state, and my husband and I have been trying to duplicate LaShish's garlic sauce for years!

This is really yummy with roasted chicken- dip the pieces in and enjoy. Be careful or you will over-eat!
