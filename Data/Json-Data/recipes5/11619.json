I added a couple teaspoons of dashi to the water since my miso didn't have added dashi. Other than this minor change the flavor was good. I don't usually put carrot and potato in my miso soup so that was a nice change. A couple recommendations: there is no need to dirty two pots. Just use the large pot that the vegetables were cooked in to make the soup. I would probably use less wakame next time but that's just personal preference.",
