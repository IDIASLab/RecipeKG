I left out the lemon zest. After simmering for 45 min I tasted the sauce and thought it was very tangy so I added grated parmesan and romano cheese to the sauce and chicken and continued to simmer for 15 more min - this did the trick! It mellowed the lemon in the sauce and helps to thicken it! This reminded me of some kind of Olive Garden dish. Other changes that I made was that I lightly floured my chicken breasts before browning - this helped to lightly thicken the sauce to a nice consistency while simmering. I will definately make this again with 1/2 the lemon juice next time. I would recommend that you give this a try - the dish has a good flavor and smells lovely while simmering!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is good but needs an adjustment to the lemon and sour cream amounts. The recipe calls for 1/2 a cup of lemon juice - as others have recommended I cut that to 1/4 cup and increased the sour cream to 1/2 cup. If you like a nice lemon taste while not overpowering please do this. If you prefer just a hint of lemon in the taste though you're going to want to cut the lemon juice down even further - a good juicy lemon gives you a 1/4 cup so if you prefer just a hint of lemon flavor I'd put in half a lemon's worth of juice which should give you the hint of lemon. I personally liked it with 1/4 cup but I don't think everyone will want the lemon to be that strong in the dish. You won't have to increase the sour cream again if you don't want because the sauce isn't really thick to start with unless you thicken it with cornstarch or flour. I served this with potatoes which was good. If you want to serve with pasta you'll want to thicken the sauce as it is much too thin even when on the stove for an hour without adding the flour or cornstarch for pasta.",
