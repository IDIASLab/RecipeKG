I did read many reviews and decided to use 1/2 box chex mix, 1/2 box cheerios, 2 handfuls of dry roasted peanuts, 1 handful of sunflower seeds and 1 cup of mini pretzels.  I also used the disposable pan trays.  I used two large sized and placed all the mix in one and drizzled sauce over.  I covered with the other disposable pan and held them together to turn over to distibute the sauce evenly.  I divided the mix between the two pans while baking.  Only needed to cool about 10 minutes on \"sprayed\" wax paper.  I did have some of it stick to the paper.  Put into snack sized bags sprinkled with M & M 's.  This does make a lot but it disappears FAST!!  I will make this again.",

After it has baked and cooled, I have never seen anyone (other than the super cool and super healthy kids in my acting class - insert eye roll...) who can keep their hands out of it. Here's how we have decided we like it best: Chop up a 5 oz jar of macadamia nuts into about half size chunks. Toast the nuts at 350 for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool. In the largest bowl you can find, mix a little over half a box of plain Cheerios, a little over half a box of Crispix, a little over half a bag of Snyders Butter Snaps pretzels, the toasted macadamia nuts, and about one third of a box of wheat Chex. Make the goo - follow the rest of the directions, baking in the largest and deepest aluminum roasting pan you can find. CAN'T STOP EATING THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!",
