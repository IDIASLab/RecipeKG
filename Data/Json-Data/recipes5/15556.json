I used a 4 ounce can of chopped green chilis instead of the pepper and only half a can each of black and white beans I thought two whole cans would be too much and one bunch of green onions. The best part is this stored very well in the frig and we ate off it for 3-4 days and it did not get soggy or gross! My whole family loved it as well as the friends I originally made it for the first day! Will make again!",
