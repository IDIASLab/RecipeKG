Which it wasn't. I'll make this again and see how it tastes without the pineapple. But 3 of my children really loved it. 3rd-ly I made fresh whip topping and added a whip topping stabilizer so that my whip topping wasn't runny when combined. I think that was a better fit for what I was going for because the pudding really thickened up everything. Will keep this recipe in rotation with other fruited dishes. TY. Will make again.",
