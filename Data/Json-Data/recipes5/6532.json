My only issue w/ this marinade was that it was so heavy on the Italian seasoning that the little green flakes just overtook the flavor entirely. I'd throw this marinade together again no prob, just reducing the Italian seasoning.",

I found that the chicken needed more than 3 minutes per side but other than that this worked perfectly. Super simple super tender and super moist. You really cannot go wrong with this recipe. I plan on playing around with the herb mix some but the lemon juice will stay.",
