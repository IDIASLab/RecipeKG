And if you don't get a good cut of Shark forget it. It will be horrible. Look for Thresher shark. Sometimes the butcher doesn't even know what he has. EDIT I'm going to update my review and mention ammonia smelling fish. If your fish smells like ammonia.....it's time to buy your fish in a different place. FRESH fish of any kind should NOT have a horrible smell of ammonia. When in doubt throw it out. http://www.fishwatch.gov/buying_seafood/choosing_quality.htm",
