I served the chicken over pasta tossed with pesto.  Easy enough for the family (my 4 year old loved it) but impressive looking enough for company.",

I made this with a slight variation: A reviewer mentioned that she didn't like the texture of the prosciutto cooking on the outside so I decided to cook it on the inside.  I pounded the chicken breasts even, dusted them with garlic powder and a bit of freshly ground pepper. I spread just one tablespoon of pesto on each breast [I love pesto but didn't want it to overwhelm the dish], a slice of prosciutto and then 2 thin slices of  smoked gouda per breast to cover the prosciutto. I rolled it up and secured it with a toothpick and put it in a greased glass baking dish in the fridge, until I was ready to bake it, which I did later at 350 for 25 minutes.  I was afraid the cheese would all melt out but the gouda held it's shape. The flavors went together wonderfully.\n\nI would encourage lovers of this recipe to try it with the prosciutto and pesto inside.",

First I pounded the chicken, then spread the pesto on the breast, then rolled the chicken and wrapped the bacon around it (picture added).  The smaller pieces that I cut off the breasts, I also pounded, spread the pesto on, but the wrapped the bacon around the chicken as it lay flat with the pesto side up (picture added, but you can't see the chicken under the pesto).  Since the chicken was not as thick on the smaller pieces, my husband said they were more flavorful.  They cooked in 25 minutes as well.  The full breasts took closer to 45 minutes.",
