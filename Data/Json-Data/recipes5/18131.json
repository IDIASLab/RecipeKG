By dinnertime my family had finished it already. We all really enjoy the flavor combination of this salad. It's something different - i.e. refreshing - to take along to a summer barbecue and it is a side dish that works well with both beef and some fish meals. Like another reviewer I do use canned beans (just make sure to drain and rinse well) so the hardest part is prepping the vegetables. There is only one tiny issue - I still think the dressing is missing an ingredient but I'm not sure what exactly. Perhaps some lime juice to add a bit more zing (FYI: If you have lemon balm growing in your herb garden use it) or another spice in addition to the coriander? If I discover it I will post accordingly. In the meanwhile try this recipe; it's wonderful.",

I love fresh mint and thought this would jack up the flavor but it was surprisingly not minty at all. I also couldn't taste the parsley. It was a tad citrus-y and a bit sweet but overall rather bland. Hubs didn't like it at all.
