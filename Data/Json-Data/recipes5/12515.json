It was about two hours before dinner and I had no clue what I wanted to do with these pieces of chicken.  So, I jumped on here and searched for some recipes!  One of the main reasons I picked it was for the fresh zucchini, since I had just bought a good amount.  I read a few of the reviews and did rub the honey, garlic salt, and pepper on the skin.  I didn't have enough basil and no parsley so I substituted with italian seasoning.  I didn't have swiss cheese either but had some grated mozzarella.  I also followed some other suggestions and added more bread (I used wheat). It was abolutely delicious!  I'm sure this recipe followed exactly is incredible as well!  It was so juicy and the skin on top was crispy.  The zucchini/bread mixture was fabulous! It was simple to make and I served it with green beans and brown rice...I have a picky 3 1/2 yr old.  She ate the chicken up! I will definitely be making this again!",
