Baked for 35 minutes (tenderloins were quite thick) wrapped in foil and let sit on the counter for what turned out to be about 45 min. due to interruptions. When sliced was perfect juicy still warm and tender. What I think I like best is the delicate nature of the flavours. I thought it would be quite strong looking at the list of ingredients. However nothing overpowered the other. On the repeat list thanks Jennifer!",

                "reviewBody": "I'm giving it 5 stars because it's a great launching point for Chinese cooking and because I like to search for recipes using the rating system, and this one is worth taking a look at.  I brought this dish to my company Christmas potluck and I got rave reviews.  It was really easy to make in quantity (I made 3 tenderloins, about 4.5 lbs.)\n\nI modified this recipe, and for those who don't cook Chinese style very often it might seem like I made a lot of modifications.  I like to cook using whatever I have in the pantry and Chinese cooking is really forgiving.\n\nFirst of all I didn't measure any ingredients, I just poured and everything together by estimation.\nI marinated my pork tenderloins for 24 hrs in the fridge in hoisin sauce, five spice, chinese cooking wine (not sherry), fish sauce (not soy sauce because I like how the flavors blend), I used Shezuan black bean sauce since the recipe didn't specify, and brown sugar ( forgot to add the sesame oil.)  The next day I preheated the oven, minced the ginger, moved the tenderloins from the marinade to a baking pan, sprinkled the ginger on top and baked at 350 for 50 minutes.  \n\nIt came out fantastic.  Everyone enjoyed it and I got a lot of comments about how tender it was.  It was great because it required very little prep.  A tasty dish with very little effort.  I think if you stuck to the recipe it would be good, but like other reviewers either use less ginger or add it in after it marinades like I did.  i baked it for 50 minutes",
