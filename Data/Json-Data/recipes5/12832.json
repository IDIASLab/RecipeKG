I used a slightly different method - just to stream line this - cook the hamburger in your soup pot - drain and return pot to stove add butter and cook the onion carrot and celery in the butter - add the flour - cook for a few minutes and then slowly add the beef broth stirring well to form a smooth base - then proceed with the recipe. In addition to the canned green beans I added a can of corn too. I added the meat browning sauce and pepper sooner than instructed and let it all simmer together. I did not add MSG - after tasting the soup I added some chili flakes and some oregano basil spice blend. That really kicked it up a notch. Hubby loved it.",
