Admittedly I was a bit put off by the cook time required for this recipe - considering it is hot chocolate. But I decided to give it a try anyway. Let me tell you this is some good hot white chocolate! I didn't garnish my first cup with whipped cream but I grated a generous helping of milk chocolate over it and it was a very nice combination of sweet. I'd definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who is a fan of white chocolate and I think I'll treat myself to a cup of this when I am in the mood for something special.",
