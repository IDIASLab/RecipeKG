This will help to avoid the lumpiness some had mentioned. I started the roux with 2 tsp of Earth Balance \"butter\" 1/4 C flour and substited the liquid recommended with 1/2C soy milk 1/2C water. As for the salt I began with 1/4 tsp and worked it up from there (maybe a scant 1/2 tsp. total). I used only 1/4 C pulverized cashews. Also I ended up using nearly 3/4 C of the nutritional yeast (more cheesy!:). And the last change I completely omitted the oil didn't seem necessary. I subbed diced toms for the peppers. I really believe the key to making this spectacular is to start with a good foundation and that means a roux!",

                "reviewBody": "I rated this 5 stars nearly 2 years ago. It is delicious! I am compelled to give a more thorough review though. To those who have tried leaving out the roasted red pepper, this shouldn't be done. It isn't spicy at all and the red pepper is helps the dish have a cheesy flavor as well as that bright orange color children are so fond of. If you leave out the pepper, you are eliminating a key element in the dish's flavor.  Also, one reviewer complained about the fat content from the use of cashews. I would like to comment that macaroni and cheese is not a health food. This recipe is certainly healthier than any dairy counterparts because the fat from nuts is more beneficial than animal fat. You will not successfully make a faux cheese sauce using only soy milk. The nuts give the dish a cheesy flavor. I do agree with some reviews that the baking time can be shortened. To keep it creamier, I only bake it for about 30-35 minutes. If I have enough soy milk on hand, I like to replace the water with soy milk just for the added vitamins and calcium. Before making this recipe, cooks should keep in mind that this is a vegan substitute and does not taste just like cheese or a highly processed boxed mac and cheese. Having made many different cheese substitutes in my kitchen, I can attest that this recipe is wonderful. You just have to know what to expect.",
