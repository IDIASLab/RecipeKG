So with that being said the peppers will not be soggy and cooked all the way through. Some people like their veggies soft so if that is your preference then definitely saute them first if you can. If you are cooking over a fire and that is your only source of heat I recommend cooking the potatoes and vegetables in a separate parcel. Double wrap with foil and put the veggies on about 10-15 minutes before you put the chicken on. My mom made these for us when we were kids and it's something I've made a number of times since. Make sure you dice your potatoes also if you are cooking in one parcel. That should help with the evenness issue. The other tip is to ensure that you aren't sticking these things directly in the flame! If you do the protein will cook and the rest will be raw.",
