A few tips to add to this recipe: Add more cooking time say 6-7 minutes as my lobster came up just a little on the raw side - or cook it with pan covered. The skin of the lobster should turn bright red thoughout. I used vermouth instead of sherry vegetable oil instead of peanut oil. Came out just fine. =)",

Next time try to put it in the freezer then turn it over and put a very sharp knife into the soft area where the tail meets the body. When you do that it cuts the spinal cord and the lobster dies. You will also find a \"sack\" behind the eyes. DO NOT EAT THAT. That is the stomach. Pull it out and discard. I hope this helps.",
