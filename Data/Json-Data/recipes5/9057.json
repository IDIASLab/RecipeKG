I too am not fond of the rubbery texture unless in soup (these seemed too big for soup) so I pan fried them in coconut oil and they were crispy and delicious. I serve with a rice vinegar chili dipping sauce and those who didn t dip added salt. I will make this recipe often. Oh prep took longer than suggested; maybe just me. Thanks hrosdail!",
