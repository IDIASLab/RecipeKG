We've taken them to many tailgating parties and barbeques and they have been very popular!",

I also found that after mixing the sauce ingredients I found the Soy sauce a bit over whelming. So I added about 1 1/2 Tbs of white balsamic vinegar which made it excellent! I padded dry the chops then seared them in a hot skillet until browned then placed in a glass dish and placed in a 305 degree oven (yes low heat 305 degrees) I baked approx 45 min. Basting a few times during cooking. And until temp was correct. Then turned on the broiler to thicken the sauce onto the chops. My chops were 1 inch thick. They were so tender and flavorful! My husband absolutely loved them. And I have a bit of sauce left over to do a steak or two!",
