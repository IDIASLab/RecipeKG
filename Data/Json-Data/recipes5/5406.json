If you are using instant lemon pudding, it does not take an hour to set-it really only takes about 10 minutes.  This ends up being a very light tasting dessert.  It is not overly lemony, so if you are looking for a strong lemon taste I would use a lemon pie filling layer instead of pudding.  I often use cool whip instead of whipped cream, but did not this time and I think it takes the receipe up a notch.  The other thing I would try next time is whipping in a package of cream cheese into the pudding.",

Made this twice now, and you should definitely add cream cheese to the pudding mixture - it's way better that way.  I also added lemon curd for a bit more zip.  I baked my own shortcake the first time, but I actually preferred the angel food cake I bought from the bakery for the second time.  This is just a fantastic and versatile recipe - my brother thinks it tastes like skittles (in the best way).",

Then I repeated the layers and topped with whipped cream--probably half the recipe amount would be enough. I topped with a twisted thin slice of lemon.
