This year I tossed my flowers in favour of herb in some planters this year and am always on the lookout for new and different full-meal salad ideas so this recipe was a perfect fit. However I do admit that reading the ingredients I was sort of thinking hmmmm...well I have to say the flavour particularly on account of the lemon and mint is simply outstanding! This recipe is quite flexible as well. Sometimes I substitute red onions and add a tbsp of balsamic vinegar to the dressing. Thank you very much for sharing this!",
