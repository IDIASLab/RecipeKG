The shrimps should be pulled straight out of the freezer, and fried right in butter and olive oil (put the oil in first then add the butter so the butter doesn't burn) until the shrimps are pink (you don't need to boil them at all, and this way they'll taste and look better anyway). Then instead of linguini use angel hair pasta and it'll go a lot better with the shrimp. Just make sure you remove the shrimp shells. I forgot to do this and my date had to pick them off individually before she ate them :)",
