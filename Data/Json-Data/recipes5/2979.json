He warned me he was not a \"honey mustard\" kind of guy. I served it on a main dish salad with lettuce greens, chopped bell pepper, carrot, celery, and sauteed turkey breast, all topped with toasted almonds. It was fantastic. After he licked the bowl, I asked him how he liked the honey mustard dressing. He asked, \"That was honey mustard?\" He loved it. This incredibly easy recipe will be a staple in our house. I used dijon mustard and low fat mayo from Trader Joes.",
