The ONLY difference in this reciped and mine is that I use ham steak instead of chorizo.  You just chop it up and stuff it in the roast like the chorizo.  My grandma could not eat the spice chorizo and there was always leftover ham to use in this.  For optimal flavor, marinate overnight.  You can do it in three hours if you must but it is even better if you plan ahead and let it sit.  WONDERFUL!!!!!",
