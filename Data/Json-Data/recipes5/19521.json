As it cooled it took a more pipe-able consistency which is what I was hoping for (otherwise I would have needed to add extra sugar) It made beautiful roses on my mini chocolate cupcakes. I had to put them in the fridge to hold their shape but it was perfect. Thanks for sharing! Update:- I initially put it in the fridge because it was looking pretty glossy as if it may melt. After leaving it in the fridge for a few hours it hardened nicely. I then decided to leave it out overnight and during most of the day to see if it would hold up and it did! My roses are still looking lovely:).",

I made one batch and thought it was lukewarm when it was not; it went from thin to hard without a good spreading phase in between. For the second try I took a reading with my instant read thermometer and held back on beating until it was just 104 degrees. That batch had a much better spreading consistency. It still tended to want to slide down the sides of the cake and then surface harden fairly quickly which didn't make for a completely attractive final product. You can't work and rework the surface like a buttercream. One more thing it is a heavy icing and needs a sturdy cake to support it. My little yellow cake layers got somewhat compacted under the weight. But we all enjoyed the taste. It never became piping consistency as some others have written so if that's important to you think twice about this recipe. Maybe there are some tricks to making it pipe worthy that I just don't know yet.",
