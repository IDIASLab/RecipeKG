I mail them to our Marine in Iraq and they are devoured! You MUST CHILL base before spreading with the topping. Also two-thirds cup of melted butter is more than enough and it should be DARK corn syrup. Line a 9X13 cookie pan with foil spray with Pam and after patting down base mix (GOOD TIP) push the edges back a bit with a fork. It becomes brittle if you bake it too long so 12 min. max. After chilling you should be able to lift it out of the cookie sheet and peel the foil right off. Also we use 1 C peanut butter and a 1-1/2 C chips melted in dbl boiler then spread on cooled base. Chill again after frosting and use big heavy knife to cut into bars. mmmmmmmmm",

Firstly I agree with adding 2 teaspoons to the crust. I also zap the chocolate/peanut butter in the microwave for easier melting. I would disagree with using a 10x15 crust - I've found the crust is too thick to get that crunchy caramelized flavor except on the edges where for some reason the crust is always thinner. So go with a bigger rimmed pan. I also disagree with cutting right away - the knife gets so sticky with chocolate! Let it cool down then stick in the fridge to harden the top, take out and let it soften a little and then cut. Much easier. I've had many people say how tasty this is!",

You MUST heavily grease or butter the pan prior to pressing the crust into it. Also, when I take the crust out of the oven, I use a greased (sprayed with Pam, buttered, whatever is handy) spatula to separate the crust from the sides of the pan: press the end of the spatula between the crust and the pan. This step makes the bars easier to remove from the pan. The topping can be spread on the crust when the crust has cooled enough to be just warm to the touch. The bars should be chilled before cutting and serving, and they should be stored in the fridge.  In order to conserve room while storing, after they are cold,I cut them up and layered them in a plastic container (waxed paper between the layers). I was \"famous\" for these bars at work; everyone was very, very happy when I brought them in.",

The things I do differently - I add 2-3 tsp. of vanilla into the crust mixture before baking. You've got to let the crust cool a bit before you pour on the topping. When finished I cut them into bars and refrigerate them. This reduces the stickiness and makes them cleaner to eat. They taste better cold too!",
