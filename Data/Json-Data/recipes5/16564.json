I needed 12 to 13 whole grahams crackers (the kind you break in half) and next time I will add another 1/2 cup of butter as overall these seemed \"dry\". In addition I would reduce the heat to 350 degrees as mine were a bit burnt at 400. Also instead of using chocolate bars I sprinkled some milk chocolate chips on top of the bars immediately after they came out of the oven then smoothed them out a bit once the chocolate had melted. These are really tasty when they turn out!",
