One as written and one with my own tweaks. As written 4 stars and with my tweaks 5. My own batch I did 1 pound of ground beef to 1/2 pound of ground pork 2 tsp salt 2 tsp paprika and 1 tsp of smoked paprika and the rest the same. LOVED this as a way to use up those extra hotdog buns you get in the package. Thanks Chef John and I will make this again!",
