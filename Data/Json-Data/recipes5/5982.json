So I tried this recipe because my husband still likes fish. I really couldn't stop eating the sauce. I'm already pondering what type angel hair pasta to pour it over next! I think I got the wrong crab meat though I didn't get the jumbo lump (mostly because I'm cheap--but I did get real crabmeat still). It did make the sauce a little thicker which I liked. I also cut up some baby bellas and added it to the sauce! I think this will be a new favorite in my house. I would def recommend it for guys trying to cook a romantic dinner for their lady.",

First of all be sure to season the fish well with all the seasonings. We felt the sauce was lacking just a little and when I looked at the package it called for only mixing in ONE cup of milk. I'd think that with the addition of the crab that maybe one more fourth cup would be more than plenty because it would give more flavor to the sauce. Another thing was that there were no instructions as to where to add the lemon juice so we just squeezed some over the top of the prepared dish. I will make this again (especially when I have a little crab left over!) and try different things but this would be a definite DO-AGAIN recipe! Thanks for our dinner tonight!",
