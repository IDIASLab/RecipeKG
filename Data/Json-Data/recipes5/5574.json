If this hummus is to be served as an appetizer or party dip, especially as just one among several options (and it's most likely that people will have just a few bites of it), then it can be highly seasoned. But if it's to be eaten in larger amounts, or even as a meal, then the garlic (or, for that matter, other strong seasonings in other recipes) should probably be toned down. By the way, with this recipe, you might begin by mincing the garlic and letting it pre-soak in a dish with the lemon juice for a bit before proceeding with the recipe. The acid in the lemon juice should help tame some of the raw garlic's emphatic assertiveness.",
