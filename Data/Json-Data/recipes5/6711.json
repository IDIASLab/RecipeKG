I seasoned the raw chicken with the coriander and just saut\u00e9ed it. Then I removed the chicken from the pan and cooked the veggies in the chicken broth (I used snow peas and broccoli). I seasoned the veggies with lemon pepper and a lemon herb seasoning blend. I let them cook covered for about 10 minutes before adding the chicken back in (and added the lemon juice at this point). This dish turned out delightfully tasty. We seasoned with salt pepper and crushed red pepper flakes before eating and my boyfriend said it was good; I too thought it was good! And both of my kids ate theirs (sans red pepper flakes). At ages 5 and 7 that's always a good sign for any recipe.;) It was a very fresh-feeling dish with just the right amount of subtle (but sufficient) flavor.",
