So, to overcome that, I added a little more garlic (3 cloves), and some spices (oregano and basil).  I added 1/4 cup of parmsean cheese, only used 1 package of cream cheese, and added 1/2 cup of saut\u00e9ed spinach. Also, I'm sure it would taste better with real lump crab meat, but I used imitation crab meat which was $3 instead of $15, it still tasted wonderful and gave it great crab flavor and texture.  This dip was gone in 30 min, and even my pickiest guests thought it was amazing!! I will definitely make this again and again.",

Had to use canned crab (drained), leave out the tarragon (not available here), and use local cheeses (mostly goat) since other cheeses are imported and cost $7+/- an ounce! I did add a few jalapeno peppers (finely chopped).  I also made it with mushrooms instead of the crab (canned crab is $5 for a small tin) and it went over well! I highly recommend this recipe and know that it can be varied and still be great!",

I was looking for recipes for the holidays but didn't want to make as much so first I cut the ingredients by half for the trial. I also used 1 T parsely in place of the tarragon because I'm not a tarragon fan. I am lucky enough to live in the NW so I used Dungeness crab. I also added 1 1/2 tsp of Old Bay and 2 T parmesan cheese to the mix. I also used about 1/4 tsp of cayenne as I like spice. I used the marinated artichokes from Kirkland brand at Costco and drained and eyeballed 7 oz. I also used sharp cheddar in place of the white cheddar as both are strong flavors and added parmesan to the top to mix with the cheddar for browning. It was a fabulous flavor but a tiny bit runny so I may cut a bit of the sour cream or mayo next time and maybe add a bit more cream cheese. I also didn't bake or serve in a bread bowl. I cut up and lightly buttered french baguette and baked for 12 minutes at 400. All in all a really good recipe that will be a huge hit at the holidays.",

I was tempted to add more garlic, tarragon, or green onions...glad I didn't. Perfect blend!! Thanks you, Chef John, this recipe was perfect and appreciated by all!",
