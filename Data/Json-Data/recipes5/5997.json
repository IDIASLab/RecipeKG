Made two servings today using a 4-oz can of albacore tuna fish two slices of toasted bread and my homemade pickled jalapenos...it was a big sandwich and we split it for lunch. We liked the flavor that the jalapenos brought to the tuna salad but did not care for the sweet pickle relish. I ve never seen cheddar cheese crumbles in the store so I just chopped up some cheddar and did add a little salt to the tuna salad. If I were to make this again I d skip the sweet relish and just roll with the jalape\u00f1os and cheddar adding a little chopped onion and celery. I think this would be a good candidate for a delicious tuna melt as the recipe author suggests.",
