I wanted a quick marinade so I deleted the salt, water and cornstarch, halved the oil and increased the soy sauce to 4 tablespoons.  Then I heated the sauce to dissolve the sugar and poured it over the chops to marinate for 30 minutes. We grilled for no more than 10 minutes and the reviews from my team were 'can we have this again next week?'  Not sweet or salty but just very flavorful and juicy! Thanks!\n\nFollow-up:  I forgot about the modifications I made last time (notes above) and made recipe exactly as written.  Much better WITH the modifications unless you really like sweet!",

Or are you saying, that if you cook the recipe with your modifications, then it will be 5-star. Okay, it's just a rant; however, I just don't get how you rate something 5-star, and then go on to tell me that you didn't like it, and here's the changes you need to make.",
