I may also use refried beans over each layer of noodles before layering the other ingredients.

We browned 1lb of hamburger and added a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes with 2 packets of taco seasoning. I put some olive oil on the bottom of my glass pan (9x13) so the noodles wouldn't stick and layered noodles, warm refried beans (made it easier to spread) cheese, meat and tomatoe mixture then more lasagna noodles. It made about 3 layers. We put it in the oven for 25 minutes at 350 then added a layer of cheese then broiled for 3-5 minutes. Added crunched up tortilla chips, diced up mixed baby green salad and sour cream with home made jalepenos on the side... BEYOND AMAZING!!! We have decided that Taco Night is now Taco Lasagna Night!",

The main other changes I have made are using 2 pounds of ground beef because I wanted it meatier and using flour tortillas instead of lasagna noodles. The tortillas make it lighter and give it more of a mexican feel than the lasagna noodles and they don't get soggy like the tortilla chips would if you are planning to make several meals out of it. I do crush tortilla chips or Doritos over the top when I serve it.",
