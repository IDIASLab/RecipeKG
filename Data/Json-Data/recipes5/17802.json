I was a bit worried since I had to make some changes (I was out of brown sugar so added a higher quantity of white sugar; used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies I had on hand and canned mushrooms) But it smelled wonderful while cooking which quickly allayed my fears. As for the finished product--- wonderful; my boyfriend and I both loved it. Definately keeping this onhand for a quick and easy dinner solution. PS-- wanted to add West Indian has nothing to do with India-- it has to do with the West Indies. There seemed to be some confusion.",

That's all. I am a pperson who seldom seldom says bad about any food but about this one I should say that it was very bad.. (And I'm confident that I cooked ok according to the original recipe.) Also due to Berbeque sauce soy sauce and brown sugar the dish cones up very black.. Dark black and it's not the color that appeals to the appetite. I will never make it again.",
