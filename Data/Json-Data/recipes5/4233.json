I used whole wheat pasta and subsituted the asparagus with spinach leaves because i'm not a big fan of cold asparagus. Do not change the dressing it was perfect! I used 12 oz. package of pasta and doubled the chicken and the dressing was the exact amount needed. My team RAVED about the salad! It was easy on our stomachs and gave us lots o energy for our race. THANK YOU so much for this awesome recipe!",

I also replaced the asparagus with fresh spinach because I didn't have fresh asparagus on hand. I mixed all the ingredients (except the pasta and balsamic dressing) and squeezed half of a fresh lemon over it & tossed (instead of 2 teaspoons of juice) Then I mixed the balsamic dressing with just the pasta really so I could see if it was as bad as people thought. It was fine so I then mixed the pasta with the rest of the ingredients. I thought the cranberries added the perfect amount of sweetness to the dish. The flavor combination was right on for us we loved it!!! but if your not doubling the ingredients I would recommend not using as much dressing as it calls for it may be too overpowering.",
