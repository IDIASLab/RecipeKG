Original: When I made this soup my local supermarket was out of endive so I substituted leeks instead. It turned out brilliantly! I added some more spices though - lots of thyme sage rosemary and cayenne. I also used some white wine and sherry to give it a more sophisticated edge. The only problem I encountered was blending the yogurt into the soup. It didn't blend and it came out looking like parmesan cheese - Still tasty though! I look forward to trying the recipe with endive soon.",
