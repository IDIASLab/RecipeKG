I used habernero-lime tortillas and some plain. For personal preference I did make some changes. I subbed salsa for the picante sauce and used red and green chopped peppers in place of the olives. I added some chopped green onions and skipped the green chilies. Thinking it could use a little spice I added a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that was a mistake. I like spicy and that made them too spicy for me. It would have been fine with the just the medium salsa I used. A good recipe that has unlimited options as to what can be added. I wouldn't stray from veggies though.",
