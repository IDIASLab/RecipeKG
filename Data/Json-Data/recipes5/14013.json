Tomatillos are best for salsa when they've been roasted, this goes for the garlic, onion, and peppers too.  Very east, just lay out on a cookie sheet and put under the broiler until the veges begin to look charred.  Turn the veges over and let char on the other side.  Remove from broiler and add veges to the food processor and chop.  Add lime juice to taste and a little kosher salt too.  DELISH!!",
