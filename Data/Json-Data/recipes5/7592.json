As another reviewer mentioned, if you steamed for 15 minutes and then used natural release, it would overcook the fish.  I cooked the full 15 min but did quick-release and it was perfect.  \n I didn't have the recommended seasoning or all the substitute suggestions, but I used Dill weed, italian seasoning, S+P, and thyme, and it was great.  I also didn't have heavy cream, so I used half and half and some corn starch (Doing the best I can during the pandemic!)",
