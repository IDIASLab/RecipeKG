It was wonderful before but for my taste I have tweeked it with the following: I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic with the onions then added the spinach along with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper until completely cooked. I used two potatoes reserving 1/2. Threw all together and used an emulsion blender to puree. Added the sour cream mixture then added the reserved potatoes and used a potato masher to break them up which added some texture. (Also used madras curry). My friends and family now BEG me to make this frequently. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!",

I am always on the lookout for vegan things I like also. The lemon is a really nice touch. This is so healthy. If you like soup spinach and curry you will love this. By the way if you make a lot of soup buy a hand held blender it cuts down the work significantly. I just added the flour over the spinach cooked it then slowly added the broth and then zapped it with the hand held blender. My only regret is I should have doubled the recipe.",

This is one recipe where it's really important to taste and adjust seasonings several times throughout the process as curry powder can vary widely in strength and quality depending on source (and age) of your curry. Start with half the curry and lemmon called for in the recipe then add more to your taste. Lemon zest rather than lots of lemon juice worked well for me. One note: I got lazy with the spinach leaves and didn't stem them very well (using baby spinach thought they'd be tender enough). They weren't; strings got all wrapped around my hand blender and I had to pull them out by hand:-( But the end soup was fantastic. Thanks for the recipe & next time I won't be so lazy!",

I also didn't read the recipe before making it... oops. So when I was getting out the spinach out I spotted some asparagus and thought I would throw some in with the green onions. I suppose I made curried spinach ASPARAGUS soup. I liked it - I would do it again! I used a meatless \"chicken\" soup base omitted lemon juice and used nonfat greek yogurt. I didn't add all the spinach - it was quite thick and rich without all of it. I have an immersion blender on order from Amazon so I pureed it in my food processor. I think it would sell well to most adult family members and at church potlucks - which tend to be vegetarian. Go ahead try it - just don't imagine the photo. Think GREEN - VERY GREEN.",

Also when adding curry powder I used 2 HEAPING teaspoons. We love the curry taste. A little tip to make it easier...If you are using a blender add about 1/2 cup of broth to the potato spinach mixture. It will puree much easier this way. ENJOY!",
