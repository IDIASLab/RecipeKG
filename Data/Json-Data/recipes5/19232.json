It is not fair.   1-18-12:   I followed the changes made by the submitter on July 1, 2009 on page 4 of these reviews.  First, I did NOT change the flour or salt or vanilla.\nI used 2 eggs instead of one, 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar,  5 oz semi sweet and 1 oz bittersweet chips to equal 1 cup total to melt, 6 Tablespoons butter, about 4 inches of banana, then mash,  1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder mixed into the flour and salt mixture. Once batter was mixed I mixed in 1/2 cup toasted pecans and 1/2 cup semi sweet regular sized chips-NOT mini chips.  If you use mini chips, they melt into the batter and the top won't be shiny.  I can taste why these won a ribbon at the state fair!",

The only real complaint I have here is the listed cook time--20 minutes? No way. I checked at 20...25...30...35...40 was the winner. 4 stars for flavor and ease of preparation!",

I follow the changes that the original author wrote in her review, but I usually add an extra banana, extra chocolate chips, and about double the amount of cocoa powder. I also add a good sprinkling of either instant coffee granules or good cinnamon to help bring out the chocolate flavor. \n\nThe brownies always turn out amazing, and  I love to bring them to potlucks or just to share in the breakroom at work. These brownies are really rich. They are not super dense, but they have a good, almost fudgey texture. The banana flavor is not very pronounced. You can taste them, but the chocolate is the flavor that really comes through.\n\nNobody in our house cares for banana bread all that much,  so this is our go-to for overripe bananas.",
