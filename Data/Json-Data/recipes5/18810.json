Makes sure to really work each little ball smooth before placing it on the cookie sheet and pressing with a fork. I used a small scooper and my 1st tray was very crumbly when I picked them up while still warm & after they were cooled. Totally work the cookie dough good. And possibly add either 1/4 cup more butter OR an additional egg for better binding. #2 even though there was 1 small 18 jar of peanut butter to the batch...I thought it needed just a tad more possibly 1/2 cup more. That's just me. But other then that.",
