Since my husband is a huge fan of bacon I did add a little more and I didn't cook this in oil but with just a little butter as I always do. I also de-seeded my tomato to avoid things getting watery. The addition of deli turkey was different and next time I might sub ham. I left the hollandaise sauce on the side and I'm kinda glad I did... I served this with a side of toast and OJ - very filling!",
