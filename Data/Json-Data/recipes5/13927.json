I baked this in individual oval Corningware dishes, which helped to contain the yummy sauce.  I didn\u2019t think an oven temperature as high as 475 was necessary, so I baked mine at 400 degrees and they were perfectly cooked in 20-25 minutes.  I think 20 minutes at 475 would have overcooked the fish.  This is super easy and we enjoyed it.",

Confussed look, creased brow. You get the idea. I snagged a package of tilapia. Somehow thought of most of the nearly everything else. There was a Demo lady who was giving samples of fish, sprikled with Chef Moritos fish seasoning on it. WOW, that is Yummy! Second, got my bottle and headed home. Whipped up a great salsa. Darn! Forgot the dill weed for the fish.! What to use? Cilanrto. Gave a shake of the fish seasoning slathered on the spread and in the oven with tator tots they went. Mmmm, starting to smell good in here! Time to toast the corn tortillas. One of my DD's friends Happened to stop by. Funny how they Just Know huh? OK gang, dinners Ready!! My DS was a bit skeptical, so he only got. Well he ate 2 more for good measure! Hubby was home and before I could get the kids fed, he was RAVING about how good these were!!  Keeper. Thanks Jalex.",

Hubs has always said he dislikes it preferring firmer fish like salmon or swordfish but I just can't eat it all myself while he grills himself a steak. I took a chance making this tonight and much to my pleasure and surprise we BOTH liked it. I didn't have green onions at hand but frozen chives filled in nicely. I wasn't confident with the high cooking temperature and 20 minutes at 425 degrees for the thick filets I had worked out fine and perhaps could have used a minute or two less. This doesn't get any easier to make and is surprisingly delicious given how quick it is to throw together and pop in the oven. Give the bonus of Hubs enjoying it too this is something I won't hesitate to make again - in fact I'll be eager to. One suggestion however - it needs a little pop of color so give it a little sprinkle of paprika either before or after baking. A spring of parsley or something green upon serving doesn't hurt either.",

I'm always looking for new ways to prepare it, ans this one got a definite thumbs up from my husband, 7 year old son, and 4 year old daughter.  I didn't use all of the spread/sauce and served it with the fish.  I made mashed potatoes and peas, and the sauce was really good on the potatoes.  This will become a halibut staple recipe!  So easy and delicious.  The only change I made was I reduced the temp to 400 and baked for 12 minutes since we \"butterfly\" our halibut steaks.",
