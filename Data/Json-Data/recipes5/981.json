There's also no binding agent--such as flour eggs or even flax meal--in which to hold everything together. So the end result was more like a loose granola than a cookie. It took a lot of smashing the ingredients together to get them to hold shape. With all that being said I think these cookies have potential. The chocolate/tahini/sunflower seed flavor is amazing and if you tone down the honey a bit it would shine through so much more! With a few tweaks I think this could be a winner. As-is though? It just doesn't really work.",

It was more like loose granola. I think that's because there's no real binder in this recipe--i.e. no flour or eggs or even flax meal would work. Maybe the addition of one (or all) of these things would take them from \"granola\" to an actual cookie consistency. With all that being said, I think these have potential. If you get past the overwhelming honey flavor, you can taste the chocolate, tahini, and sunflower seeds--and they are an amazing flavor combination!! So with adjustments this could be a good cookie. As-is though, it wasn't my favorite.",
