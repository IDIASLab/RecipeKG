Maybe using firm red and yellow apples (unpeeled to add some color), and combine the lime zest & juice and simple syrup together first before adding to the salad would help.

To make ahead, store the chopped apples covered in water with the lemon juice in the fridge, then drain before tossing in.  I did not add lemon juice to the dressing, and did not dress the salad until ready to eat. It was fantastic!",
