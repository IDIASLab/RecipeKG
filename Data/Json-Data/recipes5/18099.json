I threw some cinnamon on top to salvage it but it would have been much better with the standard pumpking pie spices blended in before baking. It's a pretty good pie and I highly recommend it to people who can't bake with eggs (I'm allergic to milk and eggs. Milk is easily substituted eggs are not).",

It wasn't great as the recipe calls for it (without the sugar) so the second time I added pumpkin spices like the other reviewers but also 2 eggs 1 banana and some applesauce. I lined the bottom with Apple instead of pear (my pears weren't quite ripe and I didn't particularly like them with the first go). Also I made my own crust (no fail pie crust with shortening). So technically my pie was very little of the original recipe but I kept it sugar free and enjoyed the figs:) I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the apple on the bottom of the pie. I know someone else said they'd skip it but that actually turned out to be my favorite part. My 4 year old ate 1/3 of the pie and his 4 year old friend ate another third. Turned out to be a great non-sugar non-dairy option.",
