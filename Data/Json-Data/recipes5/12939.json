This is very easy to throw together and perfect for a hearty weeknight meal. So if your're in the mood for Italian but think you don't have the time - think again. I added some fresh minced garlic to the ground turkey and onion. And to the sauce I added a little red wine and some Italian seasoning to give a bit of a flavor boost. The sour cream was a nice change from the usual ricotta cheese as well as the carrot. I just eyeballed everything when layering. I covered it and baked it a little longer than 30 minutes leaving it uncovered for the last 10 minutes. Great with a fresh garden salad and warm bread!",

Rather than use plain turkey, use turkey Italian sausage.  If you can find it use smoked fresh mozzarella and chunk it up and add as a layer on top of the pasta as you do your layering.  Lastly, add more veggies, I added a whole broccoli stem and all chopped up along with adding a giant handful of spinach to the pasta right after it drained.  I also used about 1/2 of the amount of sour cream called for since I tossed the pasta and spinach with it before I started layering.  The result was a must make again baked ziti!  Yum.",

The provolone I thought I had turned out to be Havarti, didnt have mozzarella or sour cream, and in the interest of time and the spirit of creativity I substituted cheeses and just hoped for the best. Used the Havarti for the layer of provolone, considered yogurt but went with cottage cheese instead of cream, and used Colby instead of mozzarella. I started with saut\u00e9ing onion and garlic to make the jarred sauce better, and left out the carrot. SO obviously I made a very different dish! But I layered and topped and baked as instructed and we had to stop ourselves from eating the entire pan. I plan to make this again using the same crazy cheese choices - maybe more cottage cheese this time, as it resembled ricotta. DELICIOUS!",

I followed the recipe to the T with the addition of 1 more carrot since the one I had was small.  Threw it in into my food processor to get grated carrots (since someone said their carrots weren't cooked through).  I though this would be sweeter but it wasn't. I kept eyeballing the '2 jars of sauce' and wondering if it was all needed, but it was. I undercooked the ziti by 2 minutes and I'm glad that I did.  This totally filled my 9x13 which made me happy.  The only thing I would do differently next time is since I used provolone slices (that's what i had on hand and it kept the sauce from hitting the ziti), I would switch up the order and put the pasta, sauce, then provolone.  Used Barilla Mushroom which tasted great and added another veggie in there. UPDATE: Made this with 16 oz cottage cheese instead of the sour cream (which I did love also - it cooks into a ricotta-like texture) to make it even healthier and it just added to the cheesiness. Love it both ways, but the hubby went crazy over this and said he would bring this to any potluck.  20 month old ate it up too.",

I will say that I didn't use fat-free sour cream though used the real stuff. I also got a little confused when layering the items so I ended up just mixing them all together except for the last two. At the end I did add 8oz of shredding mozzarella and then sprinkled the parm on top. I listened to some others and shredded the carrots instead of slicing. I had some mushrooms that I needed to use up so I chopped up about 3-4oz of mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and I also added 2 cloves of garlic(got to add garlic when using onions).
