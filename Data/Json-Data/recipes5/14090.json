Peel and cut them up big or small depending on how long you want this to take to cook. Put them in the pot and let them boil. For your \"escabeche\" you can use red or white onions. Slice them up as your plantains are cooking and put in bowl with about a teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of white or red vinegar. Stir them up once or twice while the plantains cook. About halfway through boiling add cold water to the plantains. This is known as \"asustando los platanos\". It means to frighten the plantains. Why we would want to do such a cruel thing to our lovely platanos is beyond me but this is how the aunts taught me to make them. Once the platanos are soft almost like potatoes would be for mashed potatoes (it's the same principle you're just using plantains) take them out of the water but reserve some on the side. You can mash them with a fork or with a potato masher. Add butter and a little of the water you reserved so they're not too dry. You can also add a little very cold water to them. This will help keep your leftovers soft. The finished consistency should be a little thicker than mashed potatoes. Add oil to a pan once it's warm take your onions out of your bowl using a slotted spoon.It'll pop some stir those around a bit until midway softened reduce heat then add the vinegar thats left. Pour onions on your mangu. Que le aproveche!",

In the west indies there is a similar gravy (onion peppers pimento seed ginger) they put on top of fish ans it is called escovitch it is the same kind of delcious!",
