I did not boil the eggplant rather used a covered casserole dish and left the entire thing in for a hour. I served it with rice and it was far from bland and VERY good. A super healthy dish.",

I am not sure what but there was something about the flavor that was odd not really full and savory but not really unpleasant. As suggested by other reviewers I sauteed the onion and instead of boiling the eggplant I simply put it in the casserole raw covered the dish and cooked it for a little over an hour. (I don't like the idea of boiling veggies when other means of cooking exist because I want to preserve their nutrients and flavors as much as possible.) Otherwise I made no other modifications. I think what surprises me the most is how I really like it a lot more after being reheated in the microwave. This seems unusual to me. There is still something missing IMO about the taste. I am not sure what to suggest other than the flavors seem to come out underdeveloped. I think this could be fantastic if the flavors were a little richer and full. Perhaps seasoning the eggplant with pepper and cumin or coriander prior to putting them in the casserole might help. I like the creaminess of the sauce combined with the subtleties of the onion and tomato I just wish there was more of a savory accent to draw it all together.",

I made three of each layer and due to others comments on blandness and not enough sauce I used about 1 3/4 cups sour cream 2 tsp salt and 3 cloves of roasted garlic. I added some evaporated milk to stretch the sauce too but it didn't need it it was a little watery (I forgot to sprinkle layers with flour per the recipe I think that would've helped too). But it was savory and delicious even people who didn't like eggplant or onions loved it and asked for the recipe. Thanks!",
