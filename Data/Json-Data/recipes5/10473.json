Since the seafood is encased in paper, there's really no good way to check if it's done.

I have to say, Chef John nails it!  Steaming a fillet for 15 minutes in parchment works like a charm.  I coated with avocado oil, used coarse sea salt, a heavy amount of pepper, some old bay, and slices of lemon on some sockeye and threw it in.  Then i prepared a homemade caesar salad.  The timing couldn't have been better.  A gourmet meal in under 30 minutes from start to finish.  Add a glass or two of vino, and viola...the perfect meal after a long monday.  Thanks Chef John!",

Also, you need to overlap each edge almost so that you are re-folding each edge.  Use a spoon to crease the edges.  My salmon pieces were much larger than Chef John\u2019s so I needed to cook them for 30 minutes.  The tiny potatoes and the asparagus were just fine with the extra time.  Husband loved it!",

This technique is my new and only was for cooking salmon now. I have got to be one of the worst people when it comes to cooking fish other then an easy white fish. My husband was actually astonished at how easy and delicious this meal was. I had mine with fresh broccoli and green beans and dropped them in boiling water for 2 min then pulled them out and immediately put them into icy water. Then followed the recipe as told to. I added a little Goya adobo (a Hispanics must in the kitchen), and a little blackened old bay. I then topped it with a little basil, dill and finally a few thinly sliced lemon rounds and a squeeze of juice. I didn't have the stuff to make mustard aioli, so I made my own using 1/2 cup Greek yogurt, 1 Tblspn tzatziki spice mix, 2 large cloves garlic, 1/2 tblspn lemon zest and juice, and then just processed it together. I let it chill in the fridge for a little while and gently dripped some on top after cutting open the parchment packs. Delicious meal! I think next I will try it with a stuffed salmon. :) Thank you Chef John, you have restored my husbands faith in my seafood cooking abilities!",

The other thing I didn't care for was that my potatoes were basted in salmon juice so everything just tasted the same. I didn't have asparagus so only did the potatoes. I might try this method again but without adding the potatoes.",
