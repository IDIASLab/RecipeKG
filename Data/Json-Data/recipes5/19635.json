There's a lot of stuff in here and offers a wide variety of flavors, colors and textures but the time taken to make it is well worth it.  It will knock the feathers out of your bonnet.

Good flavor but a little too sweet. Not a spice or herb in it. Sodium content is out of bounds and this would feed way more than 18 people. I just don t see a need for all those extra beans and meats in a nice bean soup. Instead of butter frying the limas they could be added a little before the others to cook in the mix. I'm sorry but I can't see myself making this again. Thanks anyway.",

Very sweet almost too sweet for me. I will make this again with less sweetness. If it was just up to me I would not put all the effort into it for the taste. It is not bad but just tastes like bean soup really. It makes a huge amount so start with a very large pan and don't worry by the time it's done it will fill it. So be prepared I had to change pans half way thru start large and be prepared to watch it grow. My husband absolutely loved this soup maybe it's a guy thing. Thanks for a stick to your ribs meal.",

I can't even find 'em on google! Other review helped..i omitted the honey and added salt and Emeril's Essence. Not a big green pepper fan so only used 1/2 of one. I sauted my onion carrots celery and 1.5 teas. of minced garlic before adding the non-Fordfork limas! Next time i will add Market Day brand roasted corn and pepper blend cuz i will use a huge caldron. We have enough for several days and they are really really good!
