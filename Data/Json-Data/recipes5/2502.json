I used ground beef and a cup of frozen fajita vegetables (onions green red yellow and orange bell peppers) and added 1/2 tsp of onion powder since I didn't have any other onion. I diced them up. I subbed a can of roma tomato paste and two cans of water for the puree. BBQ sauce used was Sweet Baby Rays Original and chili paste in the jar but it still had the same rooster picture as the liquid sauce. I added a little salt as the beef was browning and simmered this until the sauce thickened about 25 minutes This was very good and I would definitely make this again but it isn't quite your traditional sloppy joes. Very very good though. Thanks!",
