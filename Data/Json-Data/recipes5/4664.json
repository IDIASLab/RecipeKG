This adds a lot more flavor.  I used whole wheat coucous and spinach instead of parsley for more nutrition.  The end result was great!  I love the texture of couscous and the artichoke, tomatoes, feta and lemon juice are all great flavors together.  I recommend this dish as a healthy and delicious side dish!",

When leaving the couscous to soak I forgot to turn off the burner:( but fortunately caught it when it was just beginning to stick. I added a little water and left it a few minutes - it had come unstuck and was fine! To make this a full meal I added a well-drained can of tuna. We both enjoyed it for a light tasty lunch.",
