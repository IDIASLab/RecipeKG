The brown sugar and lime juice additions suggested by another reader are excellent BUT I only added 2 tbsp. brown sugar - I think 1/4 cup would be too sweet. I cubed a potato and added it as I didn't have cauliflower. I also added about 1 tbsp. tandoori paste which added a nice bit of heat. Finally I like a little colour in my curry so I added one carrot sliced on the diagonal and 1/2 red pepper julienned. Both my kids LOVED it - even my fussy 16-yr-old. Took the leftovers to work for lunch today and it was even better the second day! Can't wait to make this again!! Addendum to my review: For those who complain that this recipe is bland I do believe that the quality of your curry powder can make all the difference. Curry powders vary greatly - invest in good quality and it will make a big difference!",

I also cubed a potato. Perfect!\nAnd if you think its good the first night, just wait until you have the left overs the next day, when all of the flavor has really soaked inside. Its even more intense and flavorful. My hubby wanted me to cook it again the very next day, not to eat right then, but to put in the fridge and have for the next few lunches. \nThanks for this amazing recipe-I can finally make curry taste good in my kitchen!",

I added 2 cubed potatoes (which helped with the thickness a little) an extra tablespoon of curry 1/3 cup brown sugar and a dash of cayenne. As far as being runny most curries that you get at the Thai restaurants are not thick at all that is why the rice is sticky as it absorbs the sauce.",
