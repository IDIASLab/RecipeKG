I ate it the first night with some roti and it made for a nice light summer meal. The flavor was very strong and sour because of all the yogurt. I made the recipe exactly as written. In my opinion there is an excessive amount of yogurt in this recipe. I'd recommend adding more cucumber because I couldn't taste them at all and using less yogurt. I also recommend eating it as a dip or a topping for kebabs lamb chicken or wraps instead of on its own. Eaten on it's own it's a 1 star recipe - in small quantities as a topping or dip it's 3 stars. A very healthy recipe though! Thank you for sharing!",
