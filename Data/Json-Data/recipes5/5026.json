I'm easily turned off by the fishy flavour of plain sardines from a can but I've really been trying to find a way to make myself like them. The lemon, garlic and spices balance the strong flavour out very well... it's hard to believe I'm eating sardines! I used canned sardines with jalapeno peppers so to compensate for the spiciness I omitted the red pepper flakes. I think I could eat this everyday its just so easy, healthy and refreshing!",

I used wild caught organic sardines so for some reason I think they're fishier than regular. I did not add capers sun dried or red pepper flakes though next time (there will be a next time) I'll try it. I mixed this into fresh made quinoa which was awesome cause I never know what to put in quinoa. Added fresh diced tomatoes parm. cheese and a side of sauteed asparagus. Worked out great.
