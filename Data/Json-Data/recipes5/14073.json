I had some green tomatoes to use up so I figured I would give this a try (we like tex mex). I followed the recipe closely except left the seeds in the peppers as other reviewers suggested. This was pretty good but not lifechanging or a standout. My family prefers guacamole and also roasted tomatillo green salsa so I'll make those next time instead of using those ingredients to make this it is not bad but it's not as good as either of those either. It was fun to try something new though.",
