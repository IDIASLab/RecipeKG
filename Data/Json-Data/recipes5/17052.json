They're incredibly easy to make and they're delicious!  My variation: butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla, no raisins, and I first sprinkle the pudding over the rolls and then mix the cinnamon, brown sugar and butter together to pour on top.",

Make sure that your frozen dinner rolls are still doughy and will form together. I accidentally got the kind that I believe are partially cooked and they did not combine but still tasted great. I added a little hot water and some extra butter over the rolls to moisten the sugar mix into a sauce. I topped them with a cream cheese icing delicious!",

Thanks for the recipe!--Okay, I made these again, but didn't have the pudding.  Boy did they turn out fantastic!  I like them better without the pudding mix added (and raisins or icing).

I didn't want monkey bread like the photo so I made 1/2 the recipe in a square 8x8 cake pan. I left out the rasins and used 1/4 cup butter with 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also cooked the brown sugar and butter till it came to a boil. Remove from heat. I then added the cinnamon and pudding mix. I also added 1/2 - 1 Tbsp. of cream. I poured this into the bottom of my pan and placed the rolls on top. Baked at 350 the next morning for about 15-20 minutes. This worked for me and they turned out great. The brown sugar mixture is about the consistency of pudding and the rolls are soft and gooey.",
