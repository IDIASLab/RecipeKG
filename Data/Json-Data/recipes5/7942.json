I  bought all the ingredients but didn't realize until I went to make it that I never read the cooking instructions. So here I was the day of serving the meal and had everything in front of me and was determined to make this work. Since I already blew the overnight marinating, I only marinated the shrimp in the juice for a couple hours, and added some extra spices that were called for in the pasta dressing. I just could not bring myself to nuke my shrimp, and thought the overnight marinating might be an important step to that method of cooking. I could have cooked the shrimp on the stove top but my grill lovin husband skewered them and threw them on the gas grill, basting in the marinade. Once the shrimp was cooled down I tossed all the ingredients together except for the avocado and let it sit a couple hours in the fridge to marry. I Added the avocado right before serving. The dressing was good, sort of tangy but went well with the other ingredients. We really did like it and thought it was a great summer nights dinner, of course the hubs said some bacon bits would really take it over the top, him and his bacon. Thanks Mandy!",

One other thing you can do to make this a killer seafood pasta is to add bay shrimp to it as well as the shrimp also cut the cherry tomatoes in 1/2 or 1/4  to allow the marinade to get down in the tomatoes as well.",
