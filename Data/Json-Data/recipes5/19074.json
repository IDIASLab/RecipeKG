I'd definitely cut it out or cut down to just 1/2t. Lastly I'd totally listen to those who made the night before and cooked the next day. Wow what a difference. I also cook this half the time covered and then take the cover off the last half and the juices just make a nice glace that come onto the burger and oh my yummy!!! This is my 5th time making these in 3 wks. I love eating them!!! Even better you don't have to use the grill to perfect them!",
