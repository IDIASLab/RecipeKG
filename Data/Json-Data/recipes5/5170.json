I resisted the temptation to add the things to this recipe that I\u2019m so familiar with doing, trying to stay true to the recipe.  But I just had to cut back on the tomatoes; a full cup for two little old avocados seemed more like salsa!  So I did reduce the tomatoes to just a half cup and I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t add as much onion or cilantro as called for either.  I stuck to the remainder of the recipe faithfully and took the submitter\u2019s suggestion to throw in some fresh minced jalapeno pepper, but considerably less than the one pepper directed.  Hubs and I both thought this was pretty good, but just a tad too lemony as I kind of figured it would be as I was mixing this up.  The bottom line is that keeping in mind that I reduced all ingredients but the lemon (and should have done so with that too), I think this would be remarkably better if the exact recipe simply called for three avocados rather than two.",

I used two roma tomatoes to get roughly 1 cup chopped tomatoes and about 1/4 of a sweet vidalia onion to get 1/4 cup chopped onion. I used one chopped seeded jalape\u00f1o which gave it a mild spiciness in my opinion. Next time I might add one more jalape\u00f1o as I like a medium spice level.

For 2 people I cube one avocado & 2 small roma tomatoes cut the chopped cilantro to about 1/2 Tbsp add a clove of minced garlic 1/4 medium onion 1/2 of a jalapeno & the juice of half a small lime. I prefer lime to lemon but either works nicely & since 1/2 of the heat of the peppers is in the core seeds & veins I remove those also & just mince up the meat of the pepper. I add salt but not pepper. I've used red pepper flakes when I've forgotten to buy a jalapeno & that works ok too. Oh one other thing: this is MUCH better when freshly made.",
