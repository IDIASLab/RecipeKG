I mixed the yogurt mayo lemon tarragon and dill together earlier in the day and let sit in fridge to allow the flavors to really blend together. I increased the amount of lemon (squeezed about a quarter of a whole lemon -- about 1/2 TBSP) because I find lemon really neutralizes any 'fishy' taste. I eliminated the mozzarella cheese entirely and did not mix in the parmesan cheese at this point. When it came time to bake I spread the above mixture onto the fish and baked at 400 for 15 min. I then grated parmesan cheese on top of each fillet and placed under broiler to brown for about 3 minutes. It was excellent and my husband who doesn't like salmon really liked it prepared this way. Many thanks for the recipe idea will make again.",

This was a very satisfying dinner, and it would have been perfect with capers added to the topping.  Thank you for the recipe!",

I wouldn't serve it to company but I'd make it again for a quick weeknight meal. I might do a last minute broil next time to see if I could get the cheese in the sauce to get crusty and crunchy... it needs a little something extra so if anyone tries something different I'd be curious to hear about it.

Instead of mayonnaise I used Dijon mustard especially since some reviews mentioned the sauce being kind of boring. Like another reviewer I used quite a bit of lemon juice both in the sauce and on the salmon. Seasoned salmon with salt and pepper in addition to lemon juice and put in the refrigerator while sauce stood. Let sauce stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes then added about 1 tablespoon of drained capers. Baked about 20 minutes. Salmon was a little underdone but still very good. Sauce was great. Cooked this for friends and they enjoyed it very much. Will definitely make again.",
