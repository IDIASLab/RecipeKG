All who came by complimented on the punch!\r\nSince I did not have access to a fridge/freezer all day, the night before I filled 2 icecube trays (one with punch, the other with OJ) and kept them in a cooler the first half of the day.  I also froze orange slices in a baggie and had them floating on top with the ice cubes to keep the punch cool.  It was very colorful!  Then I froze a cool whip size container with punch and orange slices.\r\nThis acted as a huge ice cube and kept the punch chilled all day.  But it turns out this punch tastes great even when at room temperature.",
