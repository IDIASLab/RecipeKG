I loved some of the changes other reviewers made so I stole their ideas! (heheh) -I used the regular sized can of diced tomatoes and green chilies instead of the 4oz. can of green chilies. -I only used half an onion. (My girlfriend forced me not to. But there was so much flavor from everything else you could probably put 2 whole onions in and not notice!) -I used one can of mixed chili beans and one can of San Antonio Style beans. (Saw the ranch style beans but the brands looked kind of shady...) I looked at the ingriedents and the San Antonio Style beans were basically the same as the ranch style beans and apparently you could just add whatever kind of beans you want really. (From the lady who said she didn't use ranch style beans at all!) -Then I really shook things up! Some might flinch but hear me out... IT WAS AWESOME! Instead of ground beef I used freshly made Chorizo from a high-end grocery store. Now normal Chorizo comes from a tube and is basically left-over hotdog meat blasted with a million mexican spices... this was regular ground pork blasted with spices so it was delicious. If I made it again I would used a half pound of chorizo and a whole pound of ground beef. The Chorizo added SO much flavor I'll probably have to make it again without the chorizo just to see which way I like it prepared best. I loved this meal and my girlfriend who",
