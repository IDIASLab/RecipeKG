I started with 1.5 pounds of FRESH FRESH FRESH white fish nothing canned and no dark oily fish like Salmon. Use Haddok or Sole maybe Halibut if price permits. Double the oyster sauce content double the cilantro content to half cup. Use a tablespoon of molasses instead of Brown Sugar it will help in the end. ANd lastly if you can get your hands on a product called NAMPRIK PAO (Thai spelling) this will make the flavors explode. It is a paste found in a jar at many import Thai or oriental stores. A common brand name is MAERSI. Put in about 3 tablespoons of this and a little less of the sweet chile sauce and you will love this. Seems like a lot of changes but when I served this a close chef friend of mine from a noteworthy kitchen claimed these to be among the top 3 he had ever had.",
