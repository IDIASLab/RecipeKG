Most ground meat from the store is too fine, horribly overworked, and a little tough by the time you form it into patties. We avoid that problem by using a sharp knife and partially frozen meat. Plus, the sharp, savory funkiness of blue cheese helps form a glorious crust as the meat sears into it.",
