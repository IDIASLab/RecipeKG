I mixed yams and brown sugar together and then topped with the butter & marshmallows.  I uncovered the dish about 15 minutes before it was done so the marshmallows would slightly brown.  I used more marshmallows then the recipe called for and I think that along with the smashing of the yams prevented them from melting into the yams too much.  Very tasty!! Another tip...spray the foil with cooking spray before you cover this to prevent it from sticking to the marshmallows. ",

                "reviewBody": "My first Thanksgiving in charge and this dish was wonderful!  I prepared it ahead of time so I'll give the details in case it helps someone else.  Four large fresh yams (microwaved 20 minutes per a previous reviewer) peeled and cubed (they were almost too soft to cube) fit in a 1 1/2 quart casserole.  I added the butter, sugar and a cup of marshmallows and left it in the fridge.  Nothing I had was cooking at 400, so I tossed it in for 20-30 minutes with some other things at 350, and for another 20-25 at 375.  I left it covered that entire time as I wanted it to heat up, but not burn.  The marshmallows melted in and it was all golden bubbly goodness.  I covered the top with more marshmallows and popped it back in uncovered long enough for the marshmallows to merge and get toasty.  (Just about the same time it takes to brown the french onions on the green bean casserole!)  They held a soft cube form long enough to pick up with a fork, but dissolved the minute they hit your mouth.  Scrumptious!\n\nSecond time around, I peeled the yams first and cubed them and steamed them until tender.  It seemed MUCH easier for me than microwaving first and the final texture came out better.  I used too much butter, though, and it was very watery in the bottom.  Or there may be something to using a higher heat to carmelize the sugar.  Still tasted great!",
