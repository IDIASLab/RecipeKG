I like the tuna salad in it because it is a little different then most. And this sandwich is just a little different then most. I serve this with small relish tray of olives, pickles or cucumbers, green onions, pickled beets, pickled okra, and sliced tomatoes. Plus a salad of some sort, like a corn salad or pasta salad.",

There is one thing that didn't work but I'm not going to knock off a star for it because the tuna mix itself is that good. The bottom side of the melt never gets toasted and you are left with a soggy piece of buttered bread. I will toast the bottom and flip it over before assembling the rest next time. I ate the leftover tuna mix without any bread the next day and I actually preferred it that way. Hands down the best tuna salad out there!",
