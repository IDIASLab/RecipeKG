I added some grated lemon peel (after squeezing the lemon, it seems a shame to throw out the rind), chopped onion and some chopped vegies (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower) and some onion powder, along with some salt and pepper. Fabulous! Also, I didn't pay much attention to exact measurements for ingredients. It didn't seem to matter. This appears to be a very forgiving and flexible recipe. We coupled it with a Sauvignon Blanc and it was heaven!",
