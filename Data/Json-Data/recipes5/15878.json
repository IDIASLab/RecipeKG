It also makes a good taco salad topping. The only thing I will do different next time is to add a second packet of taco seasoning, thought it could use more flavor for the amount of volume it makes.  I had tried a different Mexican rice before that used uncooked rice which was baked in the oven, but I much preferred this recipe.  Was easy to make the rice in the instant pot and keep it hot while preparing the rest of the dish.",
