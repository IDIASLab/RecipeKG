Roll them in the dry cook and serve pudding.(sprinkle remaining dry pudding over the top of rolls). I melt 1/2 C. butter and 1/2 C brown sugar in the microwave to make a syrup and pour that over the top. This recipe is fabulous thank you for sharing!",

Rhodes frozen dinner rolls were fantastic in my recipe - a welcome break from canned biscuit dough. I used the quick thaw method & proofed the entire bundt after layering in the oven. (To do this preheat to 200 degrees microwave dough balls for 30 seconds each side; layer recipe as directed; put dough in and turn the oven OFF; wait a couple of hours; bake as directed.) I love the sprinkling & layering - so easy! Who knew??? I did use more butter. This one will be a staple at our house!",
