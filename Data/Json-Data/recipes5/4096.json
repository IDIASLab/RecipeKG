The lemon was too much for me--I usually don't add sweetener to vinaigrette even when the recipe calls for it but I added agave nectar to this (maybe the pistachio oil would have sweetened it up a bit--I couldn't find it so I used almond oil). I think it could have used more basil as well. Pistachio and lemon is a good combination though so I think I'll keep this as a base and just tweak it to suit my tastes.",

I didn't have several ingredients on hand so I did as a reviewer suggested and used this as a \"base\" - I actually used sunflower seed oil apple cider vinegar and sunflower seeds in this. Used Lemon Pepper for salt & pepper. Doubled the oil/vinegar mix as others had suggested. Still kind of bland but it may be because I didn't make it far enough in advance for the flavors to really meld. Will try it again sometime.",
