It tastes fine but I had to freeze the cookies to get the icing to form at all and when I took them out to wrap them to give to people the yogurt melted inside the plastic and ruined the look of them. I ended up throwing most of them away because I was embarrassed to give them out based on their appearence. I won't use this recipe again.",
