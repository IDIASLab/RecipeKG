                "reviewBody": "This is a really great roasted chickpeas recipe! I used 3 cans of chickpeas and the same cooking time and amount of olive oil and all went well. To add flavor, I added Lawry\u2019s season salt (a few shakes), 2 tsps grated Parmesan cheese or \u201cshaker cheese\u201d in my house, and 1 tsp garlic powder to the salt and pepper. I also cooked the chickpeas in 11 minute segments, stirring and rotating the pan each time. At the 22 minute mark, I simply added the olive oil and seasonings right in the pan and stirred with a metal spatula (rather than transferring to a bowl) and had no issue with this method. At the 3rd 11 minute check in, I tested a chickpea and didn\u2019t think that another 11 minutes would make them crispy enough for my liking, so I cooked them for 15 minutes the final time, and they turned out great. I think this is a good recipe, just make sure to pat dry your chickpeas (I strained them too) and rotating the pan and stirring every 11 minutes may help to ensure maximum crispiness. You may be satisfied at the 44 minute mark (and I may just like really crispy roasted chickpeas) but you may need to add a few minutes to the cooking time, I think this is just personal preference.",

Dried them off, and placed them on a sheet in the oven at 425. Just as instructed, I pulled them half way through and used olive oil spray to coat and then tossed them with my own choice of spices (cayenne, garlic and onion powder ).  Like others I decreased the first time by 5 min, and after seasoning left them in about 15-17 min.  Test a couple because the first time I took them out, one was perfect, another still a little chewy in the center. Great, easy snack, less fat, sodium, and cost compared to store bought.",
