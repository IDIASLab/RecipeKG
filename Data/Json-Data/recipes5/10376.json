I served this with crusty garlic bread and tortilla chips for the boys and celery/carrot \"chips\" for me. This dip literally lasted less than 20 minutes.

                "reviewBody": "I did love this, but to me it barely made 5 stars because following the recipe exactly leads to a \"dip\" that is just not creamy enough. I hate all store-bought jarred Alfredo sauces, almost anything involving mayo, and don't like too much of a sour cream flavor. Because this recipe eliminated those, it sounded like the perfect option. However, I cheated and added about 1/4 cup sour cream because it was just too thick. It was absolutely perfect that way (still very thick), but only if you don't plan on using chips to dip (they would break easily). I spooned the dip onto toasted baguette slices and it was awesome. I highly recommend serving it in a crock pot on low or warm heat to keep it continually warm, because as soon as it isn't piping hot, it loses its awesome texture and flare. I served it in a casserole dish, which was nice in order to get a nice brown top in the oven, but next time I'm going to try a crock pot to keep it toasty.",

I thought there was too much spinach and artichokes for the amount it made. I would probably double the recipe and keep the amount of spinach and artichokes the same. It was not creamy/liquidy enough for me so you couldn't really dip the tortilla chips in it which is the way my husband and I like it. The gruyere has a really smoky and distinct taste. It added a lot of flavor but was just a bit over-powering for me. I was really attracted to the recipe because it doesn't use mayo which I can't stand. So overall I'm disappointed. I'll try to add something to make it more dip-like if I make it again.",
