Tips for perfect caramels that my Grandma gave me: After you mix all the ingredients except Vanilla use a cold wet paper towel to wipe down inside of pan up to caramel and throughout cooking make sure you stir gently as not to deposit lots of caramel on the edges of the pan. It only takes a small amount of undissolved sugar to ruin caramels.  Also be sure to stir often and rinse and dry your spoon often as this keeps uneven caramel from getting mixed.  Definetely cook the caramels to about 250f if you want to wrap them.  And add the vanilla AFTER you shut the heat off.  ENJOY! ",
