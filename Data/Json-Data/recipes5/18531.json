I didn't have pure maple syrup but I did have pure Butter Pecan syrup which was a workable substitution. I ended up using this butter on the Nut and Grain pancakes from this site which turned out alright. I don't know if I'd make it again but it WAS good.",

It was like eating cinnamon raisin bread with butter and sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top. I put it in a one cup container with a twist top lid, and it fit perfect. It was a very handy container to store it in the fridge. I will definitely make a cup of this as is every fall!",
