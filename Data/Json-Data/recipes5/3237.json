How does an 8-count package of rolls produce 6 servings? There is really no indication of how to 'fill each roll and form into patties'. I ended up rolling them out a bit and using one roll piece on the bottom and the other on top producing four large 'patties'. Oh and if your filling is hot you may want to do your forming right on the cookie sheet or you'll have a time getting the prepared patty off of your work surface as the dough becomes very soft and sticky! I may use this filling again though. It was tasty in a wrap with some chicken the next day.",

The filling is similar to a samosa filling I followed the recipe exactly except for adding garlic to the filling (because I add garlic to everything I can). I \"formed the patties\" by separating the crescent dough and rolling each one out a bit then adding the filling to the center and wrapping the rest of the dough around it pinching the open gaps together as I went. These baked up to a golden brown in 15 minutes in my oven and I served them with some coriander chutney on the side. Thanks for the recipe!",

I used Pillbury brand which had 6 crescents. The package did say butter flavor but that s all the grocers had. My 6 year old loved them though. Will try it again with possibly puff pastry or other plain refrigerated dough.",
