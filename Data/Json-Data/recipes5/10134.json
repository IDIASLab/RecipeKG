For a lighter-colored broth, omit the roasting step and use peeled veggies. The longer this simmers, the richer it gets, however don't go longer than 48 hours as the flavor can turn bitter. Make sure about half your bones are collagen-rich, such as chicken backs, feet, or wings. Season with additional salt, if desired, upon serving.",

After starting the recipe, I was thinking this is not worth the time, considering the roasting of the bones...the slow cooker on the counter, saving bones.....So after cooking for 32 hours I didn't have a desire to mess with it too much so I dumped the cooked broth into a large vessel, covered it and placed it in the fridge. It turned to jelly. That's a good thing!....so I have read. No fat on top, which was interesting. I heated it up a couple of days later (to thin it out )so I could distribute into jars, gave it a taste...it was fantastic! I can see why people served this as a soup! It was so deep, rich, and full of flavor and totally  worth the effort! I'll save every chicken bone  for now on!",

                "reviewBody": "Actual restaurant chef here, with a sanitation license. Solid technique mostly, but there is no reason to not peel veggies unless you leave yellow onion peels on to color chicken stock. Carrots, celery, onions, and leeks (especially those guys) are usually full of dirt, bugs, and probably ammonium nitrate and pesticides. If you didn't watch a hippie grow it, peel it. And definitely cut the ends off. Garlic can stay unpeeled if you're tossing it after, but that's it. Strain it a second time through cheesecloth while warm or it will be cloudy. And there's no need to cook any kind of stock more than 12 hours or so, even on a very low heat like this. I know \"bone broth\" has been a great marketing tool lately, but it's literally stock. No established health benefits beyond comfort and a nice wallop of vitamins and minerals. But flavor for days. And please do your research, folks. Collagen is something your body makes. You can't just drink it and have hair and nails like a Kardashian on prom night. As far as stock and soup are concerned, collagen and gelatin from bones and connective tissue contribute flavor and mouthfeel, that's about it. If you want it to be more luxurious and more gelatinous, or if you're trying to make aspic, add an equal amount of beef or chicken feet. No, you don't have to eat them. Unless you've already had a hot dog. But the pros have been doing this for centuries.",
