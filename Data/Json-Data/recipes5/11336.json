There was quite a bit of milk in the bowl this morning although the oats were plenty tender. I did end up spooning some of the milk off but I liked the delicate cinnamon flavor which often can be overpowering. This was OK and I like the fact that it s low calorie but I think my personal preference still includes the yogurt which makes the oatmeal creamier. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
