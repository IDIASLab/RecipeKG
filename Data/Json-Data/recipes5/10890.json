I cut the salt back a little, and didn't put the spices or hot sauce directly in the nugget. Instead I used Chef Johns buffalo wing sauce (which is amazing) as a dipping sauce for the adults. Also, I didn't read the recipe ahead of time all the way through so I didn't realize how long they need to refrigerate, I used the suggestion of cutting down the time by putting them in the freezer and it worked perfectly. I will be making these again, but this time will plan ahead!",
