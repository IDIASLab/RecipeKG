I did not have buttermilk so I used 1 Tbsp of lemon juice mixed with 1c milk and let it sit for 5 min. I used splenda brown sugar mix, light butter, and baked it in an 8x6 pan for ten minutes less than stated. It was perfect and just may have to replace my go-to beer bread recipe from this site (whole wheat beer bread). Loved this this one had oats. Also, I wasn't expecting it to be as sweet as it was and may decrease the sugar next time. Although my sweet tooth can't complain. Thank you for the recipe!",

Seemed done after 1/2 hr on outside but inside wasn't entirely done. 03/16/16 I think 350 was too low cuz bread didn't raise much. Was it the difference in more baking soda than baking powder? Try 1 tsp baking soda and 2 tbsp baking powder. I didn't make it in loaf I made it in round 8\" and used 3 pans and tried one with some cinnamon (1/2 tsp full recipe) and raisins (1 C full recipe) Maybe start out 400 for 1st and 375 or 350 for last time.",

The only thing that I did differently was take the bread out of the oven 15 minutes early...it was done. It is a heavy bread but has a lighter texture than say brown bread. It turned out beautifully moist not too sweet with just a hint of the Guinness. It really was delish with butter and honey but I think this would be equally good with a hot bowl of soup or stew.
