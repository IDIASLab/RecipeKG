Browned them in olive oil/garlic for 5 minutes on both sides then transferred to the oven at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  While they baked I used the ingredients for the sauce plus a dash of italian seasoning.  I added all of this to the left over olive oil/garlic from browning the chicken.  It turned out great!  I served my chicken and sauce over leftover rotini plus pasta and my husbands over leftover rice.  Great easy meal that I think my kids will eat and will always have the ingredients on hand! Thanks!",

My daughter is continually asking for chicken and rice, and there's only so many times you can do that before you never want to see chicken again. I have resorted to finding many many ways to make my chicken so everyone in my house is happy. I do have to say that this is one of our favorites. What I do is, cut chicken breasts into bite size pieces and sprinkle with lemon pepper. Then I brown them in a little oil along with diced onion. When the chicken is cooked I add the sauce ingredients (doubling, but we like ours extra saucy) I then let the mixture simmer until it is bubbly and serve it over rice. Thanks for the idea!!!",
