I\u2019ve made them several times now for friends and family. I too used regular sugar/eggs and usually double the recipe, adding a little vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg. I like that they are slightly sweet because I don't really like to use maple syrup. A tip for cooking them: make sure your griddle is heated thoroughly and maintain a medium heat. Since this batter is a bit heavier and thicker, they need to cook a little more slowly than other pancakes. Also, I often use the back of a spoon to spread the batter into a thinner, rounder pancake right when I put them on the griddle.",

I dusted it with powdered sugar since syrup would have ruined it for sure. It was delicious and sweet enough without the maple. I found another version of this on cdkitchen that required a lot more ingredients such as vanilla extract. I wonder if it would taste better then. So next time I'm going to try it with the subs.
