We also marinated the steaks in a mixture of Merlot, Worcestershire, Mustard and some spices. Even though we made it for 2, we used the entire sauce recipe. We also used high quality Gorgonzola cheese since we prefer this. For those of you not used to cooking steaks in the oven, remember when you're searing you aren't cooking the steak. Just sear it until the color is brown, otherwise you'll have grey steak from the oven. Also, we have a gas oven that cooks a bit high so we reduced the cooking time of the steaks to 10 minutes and 3 minutes in the broiler. We used a NY Strip and a Ribeye and they tasted wonderful. It's also important to let the steaks rest after the oven so the juices redistribute so don't forget this part. We mashed red skin potatoes and added 1 tbs of the gorgonzola cheese and 1 tbs of heavy cream (you can sub milk) for the right consistency. We also served with asparagus that we grilled on our foreman. ",

The end result was as good as anything we have had in a 5 star restaurant.  \n\nI made them exactly as the recipe stated (using Gorgonzola Blue Cheese).  Although, I only made 2 filets and didn't change the amount of the sauce, there was plenty that way.\n\nI was concerned about them cooking too much, so I quickly seared them, then baked them for 10 minutes.  I broiled them (not too close to the heat, the cheese will burn) for 4 minutes.  Then I turned off the oven and put them on the bottom rack for one minute.  We like our steak on the rarer side, so that extra minute was not needed.  The steaks were still pink in the middle, but could have been cooked just a little less.\n\nI served this with the Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes (submitted by Kathleen Burton) that I modified a bit (see my review), a caeser salad, and a bottle of Stag's Leap 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nThe meal was to die for...",

My husband could not stop saying how good they were.  To save on dishwashing, I just broiled the steaks right in the cast iron skillet instead of transferring them to a baking sheet--it worked great.  I served the steaks with a green salad (topped with orange sections, cranberries, toasted pecans and a light vinaigrette), a shitake mushroom risotto and sourdough bread.

What a lovely entree for Valentine's Day. Thank you!!!\n\nI served it accompanied by sauteed fresh sliced button mushrooms. Yum!\n\nWhile I've seen others had success with \"regular\" breadcrumbs, I'm glad I used panko. Mixed with the crumbled blue cheese -- inspired! The fresh thyme was wonderful, plus I used fresh (not jarred) garlic.\n\nI'll make this again, especially for company. Though I'm not sure I'd do the port wine sauce. The meat as otherwise prepared didn't seem to need it. However, if you do use it, boil it down until the liquid is almost all gone.\n\nThis was as good or better as any fine restaurant's steak entree! And so easy.\n\nVery impressive.
