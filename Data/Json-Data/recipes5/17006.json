Overall a VERY good recipe - very tasty and I was amazed that the cheese didn't melt also. It kind of became crunchy instead.",

I don't care for canned fillings so made my own using 5 med. sized Granny Smith apples. I got distracted while making the crust and put the butter sugar and flour in the bowl together. Rather than dump it out and start over I mixed it that way and ended up having to add a couple tablespoons water to get the dough to hold together. Was worried it would be tough but turned out tender and good. I'll try it the right way next time and see what the difference is. Also next time I will only use a 1/4 cup or so of the flour in the cheese and brown sugar mixture -- 3/4 cup was way too much. I'm sure the cheese is not SUPPOSED to melt. A good DIFFERENT recipe -- thanks.",
