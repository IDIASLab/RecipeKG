                "reviewBody": "I had a craving for ham yesterday and found a 2 lb. cottage ham at a local grocery. I'd never heard of that type but noticed they were rather pricey so I figured it was most likely a finer cut. I was right. Yay! I believe most any kind of decent ham would work in this recipe. However the smaller size and shape of of a sliced cottage ham really helps make a mouth watering presentation at the table! Wish I'd taken a picture. I changed the recipe slightly because of what was in my root cellar. I used about 1 1/2 lbs. of baby German Butterball potatoes (similar to Yukon Gold) a qt. of canned Black Valentine Green Beans and 4 small Stuttgarter Yellow Onions ends trimmed and otherwise left whole. Quite frankly I think one could use just about any variety of these vegetables. I can't imagine the combination of these 4 simple ingredients getting screwed up. Aside from that I followed the preparation instructions to the letter making sure to cook the potatoes just to the point where they could easily be pierced with a fork. Then I drained the whole pot into a colander and literally dumped it into a ceramic baking dish for serving. On a cutting board I sliced the ham a generous 1/2\" thick then transferred it to one end of the serving dish. Thanks Michael for the inspiration. Down home cooking just doesn't get any better than this!",

We always get our Hams from an old fashioned butcher shop! Being of German descent this is a must! I have found though that if you put the potatoes in at the start they get really mushy! So I add them about an hour before it's completely done so I never use the crock pot! I also add a few cloves of garlic & some regular Mrs. Dash! Also Cottage Hams are not smoked never were they are also not pork butts! They are brined hams! Germans aren't into smoked meats! They are more the brined or pickled!",
