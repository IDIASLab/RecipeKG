We are busy people and don't have time to make elaborate meals in the morning. In the past we have bought frozen breakfast burritos, but they are not very tasty and I knew they could be improved upon.  This recipe will make a large batch of the burrito fixins that you can freeze, or store in the refrigerator so that you can make great breakfast burritos whenever you please.",

I cut the recipe way back because I didn't need quite that many and made my own taco seasoning.  I added some crumbed bacon and diced green pepper plus a mix of cheddar and jack cheeses. You can add pretty much anything you want or have on hand because once you combine meat, scrambled eggs and cheese in a warm tortilla it's bound to be good.  All you need is a side of salsa, sour cream, a little tabaso or cholula and you're in breakfast heaven!",

Also, we eschew taco packets in this house, since having discovered \"Taco Seasoning I\" recipe on here, so I used 1 TB of that. Just the right kick, and really tasty.",

There was a little leftover so I just assembled it and wrapped them up for a late night snack for my husband. YUM. It really makes a ton which is a blessing for me because my three boys can EAT.
