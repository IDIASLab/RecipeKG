I love coffee in just about anything and I couldn't let poor reviews deter me. I added a little vanilla in with the egg and used those tiny cups of coffee shots up to one cup to really concentrate the coffee flavor. After all the ingredients were combined the dough was really liquid-y. I didn't add the raisins because I didn't have any but I doubt that would change the thickness of the cookie dough. This was something that some of the other reviewers had issue with. So I added another half cup of flour. I tried the dough and it was good but could use a little firming. So it's in the fridge for a couple hours. I'll update this once I've made them. I plan on frosting them either with a coffee icing or mocha icing. EDITED: These turned out really well. I thought when they puffed up while cooking that they would be one of those cakey kind of cookies. Not so. They fell when cooling and got pretty little crinkles on top. I frosted them with the Mocha Icing from this site which was just the right icing for this particular cookie. I will make these again with my adjustments. You really need the extra half cup of flour and the time in the fridge to firm. This does make a tasty cookie. EDITED AGAIN: My husband fell in love with these and wants to take a batch to work tomorrow. These were way better than I thought they would be.",

I love cinnamon brown sugar and coffee and the combination (though perhaps not characterized by one strong flavor) tastes great. Also because my oven broke the night I tried to make these I discovered that this recipe makes EXCELLENT pancake batter. For those complaining about the cookie dough being too liquid I suggest chilling it in the fridge for an afternoon or overnight--it is much easier to shape that way.",

My husband is a diabetic so I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 Splenda brown sugar (1 cup Splenda plus 1/4 cup of molasses or sugar free maple syrup=1 cup of brown sugar and I used the molasses). The dough was very soft so I refrigerated it as another reviewer had suggested I did it for a couple of days only because of time constraints and the dough was still OK. The cookies ended up roughly 2-inches in size and I had 96 cookies (with a size 70 cookie scoop) instead of the 36 the recipe said it would make. I'm thinking if you only made 36 cookies they would be Shrek size! If anyone has made these could you please put in your review how many you made... just curious.",

I wish I could give this a better rating as they turned out tasty even though they didn't have much of a coffee taste but that's why I'm giving a lesser rating: It's supposed to be a coffee cookie but lacks the coffee flavor. I decided to top these with coffee-flavored icing since they turned out like fat mini-cakes and my family really liked that. I'm going to play around with the recipe more. I think it needs 2-3 tablespoons of coffee liqueur. I also decided to use coconut instead of raisins which turned out well. Also threw in some chocolate powder after reading the reviews and saw it didn't have much of a coffee flavor; might as well taste like chocolate! As a side add cooled coffee instead of \"piping hot\" to keep the batter from liquifying. Then refrigerate at least an hour afterwards to help shape it. Anyway I'll come back to this.:).",
