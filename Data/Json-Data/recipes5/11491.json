                "reviewBody": "I found that the sauce in this recipie was not enough, as there was none in the bottom of the pan for basting. Also, it was a little to thick.I think a thinner sauce and more of it, would make for better basting. This recipie did not specify wheather to bake covered or not. This can definately affect baking results.I would, however try this dish again, making certain revisions. It was pretty good but could stand some improvements.***UPDATE- I originaly gave this recipe 4 stars, however,I have made some revitions and will now give this recipe 5 stars. Here is what I do....Do not precook the ground beef. Mix uncooked beef with 1/2 C instant rice. (saves time) Instead of garlic and onion powder,sautee 1 small onion, finely chopped, and 2 cloves minced garlic in olive oil prior to adding to meat mixture. Also I add 1/2 of a 15 oz can of italian style stewed or diced tomatoes and 1/2 t italian seasoning to meat mixture. For the sauce I use 1 15 oz can of tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 can of tomatoes, pureed,a dash of sugar and 1/2 t of italian seasoning. Or,you can substitute jared marinara sauce for tomato sauce in both meat mixture and over the top. This works well. These can also be cooked in a slow cooker on high for 2 1/2-3 hrs or untill thermometer inserted into center reads 160 degrees. Enjoy!",

While cooking the meat, I added ALOT of onion powder and 2 cloves of garlic, minced.  I used brown rice.  I mixed together with regular tomato sauce and worcestershire. Then topped with basil, oregano, garlic tomato sauce because that was the only other can I had available.  I baked at 350 for 30 minutes, I did not baste every 15 minutes. They turned out tender, not mushy, and wonderful. My husband has never had stuffed peppers in his life and loved them, actually went back for seconds.  My children (10 & 6)topped theirs with parmesean cheese and ate the meat out of the middle, thought it tasted like the meat used in spaghetti sauce.  They both tried a taste of the pepper, which made mom happy. Maybe next time they'll try more.  Great recipe!",

I removed and browned meat(used the beef, pork, veal mix for better flavor) draining all the gross grease and returned the tasty onion mixture back again.  I then added the 2 cans of tomato sauce, worcestershire sauce, rice, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and a dash of paprika, and 1 cup water like the other reviewer suggested(dont think it really needed all that water-maybe half) and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Toward the end I added in some shredded cheddar cheese(love cheese).  I stuffed red, orange, and yellow peppers and placed in a casserole dish on top of tomato sauce and baked as directed.  They were good but I tend to like a little more rice in my stuffed peppers so next time I will add a tad more rice..otherwise these were very enjoyable.",

I could see this recipe in a basic and general reference-type cookbook. I did put my own spin on this as well. I used green, orange, yellow and red bell peppers, not just for color but for a milder, sweeter flavor. I cut them in half lengthwise, then blanched them for about three minutes before transfering them to an ice bath. I cooked the rice, but did NOT cook the meat - added an egg, chopped onion, minced garlic rather than the garlic and onion powders, fresh chopped parsley, oregano and thyme, as well as salt, pepper, a handful of grated Parmesan cheese, and tomato sauce I had put up from my garden. Poured more sauce over the peppers than called for, dotted with butter, then baked for about 45 minutes. Now it's a five star recipe in my book!",

Even with a few substitutions: Used ground turkey vs. ground beef, added a can of diced tomatoes with roasted garlic (omitted garlic powder) to ground turkey before stuffing, used 2 tsp. of italian dressing (fat-free) vs. 1 tsp., omitted the worchestershire sauce, covered it with foil so no basting needed. This recipe did yield enough filling for only 4 large bell peppers like the other reviewers stated, which made 1 bell pepper too much for one person. Next time, I'll try and make it for 6 small bell peppers (so there will be enough room for side dishes!). Thanks for the great recipe!",
