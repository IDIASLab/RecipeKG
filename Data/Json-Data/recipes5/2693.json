I skipped brushing filets with butter, sprinkled them with lemon pepper instead and added some dill weed to the breadcrumb mix instead of thyme.

I had thawed some haddock, so that is the fish that I used.   Also, I did not have panko breadcrumbs, but instead had seasoned breadcrumbs which is what I used.  Because of this, I didn't also add thyme.  I added the salt to the fish prior to putting the crumb topping on.  I found that it was WAY too salty, but it could have been because I did this, although Parm cheese is salty and I questioned the quantity of salt before adding it.  That would be my only complaint.  Next time, I will make it this same way, only I won't bother with added salt, pepper or thyme.  I never use pepper, so I've got the recipe down to four ingredients.  Amazingly good and easy.  I rarely cook fish because I've not been happy with options for cooking it; now I'll have it much more often. Yay!",
