And it was freezing rain out so I didn't want to BBQ so I preheated my oven to 550 then when it was hot turned it off and the broiler on and cooked the chicken on the higher rack. We wanted something simple after eating rich food over the holidays and this chicken basmati rice and steamed asparagus & carrots did the trick!",

I made 2 types of grilled thighs for dinner this one and 'Big Al's Chicken' and I preferred the taste of this one. I marinated the thighs (only parts used) all day. The skin does get very dark like the picture shows but it was NOT burnt. Served this with 'Alison's Colcannon and Cauliflower with Dijon Sauce' both AR recipe. Everything together made for a really good dinner. Thanks whey2big4u for sharing your recipe.",
