Skipping the butter and using a tiny amount of olive oil in a well-seasoned iron skillet or non-stick pan helps cut calories, too. I added: oregano, minced garlic, saut\u00e9ed onion, a tablespoon of homemade pesto paste, freshly ground pepper, and about 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Instead of bulk sausage, I added a few cubes of hard summer sausage. I used part-skim ricotta, too.",
