The only change I suggest is to fry the zucchini noodles separately in a pan with olive oil to cook them first then drain off excess liquid before adding them in with the rest of the ingredients in the dish. If you put the noodles in without pre-cooking they will release all of their water in with the sauce which makes the dish watery. It has great flavor! You can also use walnuts instead of pine nuts if you wish.",

As far as changes I played with the amounts of ingredients as I was feeding a bigger crowd. We had fresh green beans which I chopped and used in place of the peas and I omitted the tomatoes. Don't drain the liquid after sauteing vege's- the flavor was awesome and mixed well with the alfredo sauce (used 2 jars) and freshly grated parmesan cheese. I steamed the spiralized zucchini in a big pot on the side as well as a pot of fettucine noodles in another for those not watching carbs. We had grilled Italian marinated chicken breast to go along with the dish. We then just spooned the sauce mixture onto the chicken on top of our choice of zucchini fettucine or both. Excellent flavor!",
