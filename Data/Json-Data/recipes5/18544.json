After I put my twist on it.  I wanted to cover the entire vegie/meat mixture w/ liquid so I used the whole bottle of (light) beer, plus some chicken broth.  I used the same amount of brown sugar & a heafty dash of cayenne pepper instead of chili sauce.  In each bite I got the sweetness of the sugar finished with the spiciness of the cayenne.  Chock full of flavor!  The meat was fall-apart tender too.  I cut it into bite sized pieces which I think contributed to the tenderness.  Try this one for sure!",

It isn't a hot condiment. It's usually made with tomatoes onions vinegar and a few seasonings but nothing hot no hot pepper or cayenne etc. Chili sauce isn't the kind that is often used in Thai cooking. It's a beefed up catsup. If you make this via the quick method you will get a stew that isn't cooked properly. The veggies will be raw and the meat tough. Put this in a slow cooker on high for two or three hours maybe more then cut down for two or three more hours at low. You want the meat to fall apart.",

However since it was already very spicy I just set out some sour cream to stir in which helped. I used a brown ale for the beer.",
