The only thing I think I would do differently next time is add some thinly sliced red onion, just to kick up the flavor a bit, but that's my personal preference. I only had kaiser rolls, so that's what I used, and that worked well. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I did not use the grated cucumbers in the cream cheese but did everything else.  My additions were mustard with the cream cheese and then I added pepper jack cheese to regular hamburger buns.  When these 2 discriminating teenagers make a request to keep this on the rotating lunch menu - it's a winner!!",
