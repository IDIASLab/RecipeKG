The cooking method in this recipe is pretty accurate, but...don't discard the stems! Slice them as you would celery, then cover with water and simmer until tender, then add them to the leaves.  The stems of Rainbow chard are particularly pretty and add great texture and contrast, not to mention flavor!  I don't bother making a garlic paste, mincing the garlic is perfectly fine.  Lemon is not something I routinely add and I found I liked it, tho' I only gave it a squeeze from a half lemon. I didn't use as much bacon either, tho' the term \"one bunch\" of Swiss Chard is vague, so certainly add all ingredients to taste.  For those not familiar with Swiss Chard it is mild, tender and a little sweeter than spinach - not bitter at all like other greens.  The effort involved to wash, trim and cook it is well worth it!",

I'd never tried Swiss Chard before but my other gardening friends all grew it so I thought I'd give it a shot. Only difference was I used minced fresh garlic instead of paste. In a recipe unless otherwise stated an ingredient is typically raw like the bacon for instance. Covering the dish for 4 minutes is important because this lets the juices from the leaves steam themselves producing a tender-crisp texture that is just delicious! It did not say to remove the bacon or drain the grease like one reviewer did the grease is part of the sauteing fat so I left it in and followed the instructions as written and with that there was plenty of liquid to cook in. One bunch was perfect and from what I've seen a bunch is typically 8 to 12 leaves... just right for a family of 3 or 4. The recipe was perfectly clear to me and the whole family loved it! It earns its 5 stars!",

                "reviewBody": "We had a very hard time understanding the recipe. First we couldn't tell if you chop uncooked bacon (a chore) or cooked. So we used raw bacon and had the \"separated fat\" from the meat in the pan. It didn't say drain it or remove bacon; just melt butter in the skillet. I chose to drain it and wipe the skillet out first then add the butter garlic and lemon. As others had suggested we enjoy using the sliced crunchy stems and had to cook them a few minutes first so we tossed the bacon pieces back in. Then we added the leaves which we kept stirring over medium heat so neither the chard nor bacon would scorch because there was very little liquid. I can't imagine turning up the heat and covering it. By the way since we were confused about how much swiss chard is a \"bunch\" we used about 12 large leaves... maybe it was too much? I gave it 4 stars because the flavor was very good and the ingredients are a great mix. Just wish it was written more clearly.",
