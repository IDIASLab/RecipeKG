Topped the tacos with Southwestern Slaw and made pinto beans. I followed recipe to a tee. The only thing that I had to adjust was cooking time. My 4 pound roast (bone in) took almost 7 hours to be fork tender and fall off the bone. It was worth the wait though! We just ate towards the end of the game instead of half time. The kids and adults couldn't stop raving about how good this was. This is a keeper and one that I will make next time we have a crowd over. THANKS!",

I then poured the green chilies over the top wrapped it with the foil and laid it on my roasting rack in my roasting pan. This roast pork was moist flavorful and off the charts delicious.

The cooking time was far too little for me as some others have noted. Because we were on a schedule I ended up just carving the roast like normal after five hours and cut into strips and chunks for bowls tacos etc. I also did not find this to be as spicy as it was described. The meat is wonderfully seasoned but some cayenne pepper or maybe even some more authentic mexican chilis/powdered spices would be needed for this to be spicy.
