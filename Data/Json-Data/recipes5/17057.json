Here are my successfully tried changes (makes it a little easier):  Use dried minced onion instead of fresh grated. Like many other reviewers, I replace half (or more) of the water with pineapple juice -- yum -- and I use pineapple chunks instead of rings, added to the pan in the last ten minutes of baking.  One time, I was making this for company, and already had all the chicken in the pan with the sauce, ready to go in the oven, when I decided I didn't have enough chicken, so I took some raw pieces and breaded them, and threw them in, hoping for the best.  In the end, we liked those pieces better (they're softer), so since then, I always skip the frying step -- it's a lot easier, and one less dish to wash.  Another tip I read in the reviews was the cut the cutlets up into smaller pieces -- this really makes it good.  Make a lot of extra sauce and serve over rice.  You won't regret making this recipe.",

But, the chicken just didn't taste very seasoned.  I think it needs to be seasoned enough on its own because it just tasted like plain chicken smothered with the sweet sauce.  Second, the cooking time :  there is no way in HE-double hockey sticks this chicken could stay in the oven for a full hour, especially after already being in the pan for 7 minutes!  I left mine in for no more than 25mins (granted I halved the recipe) and it was overdone.  I'd say check it to make sure the juices are clear, but even my super slow oven would've completely ruined the chicken after an hour.  I will consider making this recipe again because it is so asthetically pleasing, but I will make big seasoning changes and obviously alter the cooking time.",

This was a huge hit at my house!  After a week of nearly having to force my 8 year old to eat dinner.. I was thrilled to see him eat every single bite on his plate.  I served it with white rice.  The breading was soggy, and I dont know how to get around that.  I thought about leaving it off the next time, but it really does have nice flavor.  Even if it was soggy, it tasted good.  It is a bit on the sweet side, but in a good way.  Will be keeping this one.  I would be giving it five stars, if it wasnt for the soggy breading.  Which didnt bother anyone but me.***after making this for several months as a regular around here, I can highly recommend not covering the dish.  It comes out much less soggy, and the sauce thickens up***",

If you added in some dry chilli peppers or just a few pinches of cayenne, I bet the sauce would be just perfect.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make chicken that has the consistency of Chinese chicken, do the following.\r\n\r\n1. Cut your chicken (breasts or thighs work) into cubes.\r\n2. Put them in a bowl with egg, s&p for 15-30 min.\r\n3. Put a ton of Cornstarch on a baking tray and spread it out.\r\n4. Batter each piece of chicken and deep fry them at about 375 till golden brown.\r\n\r\nFrom there you can just add the sauce any old way... throw it in a sautee pan with the chicken and bring the sauce to a boil... it'll latch right on to the chicken.\r\n\r\nServe with yummy eggrolls and Mike's Hard Lemonade.

I only use 3-4 chicken breasts since its just two of us and I keep the full amount of the sauce.  After sauteing the chicken, I make the sauce in the same pan and scrape up all the yummy bits left in the bottom from the chicken.  I then let the sauce simmer for about 5-6 min to let it reduce slightly.  I bake everything in the oven without covering, for aprox. 25-30 min.  When it comes out the sauce will have reduced and thickened more and the chicken is coated nicely.  I slice the chicken and serve over white rice with more of that yummy sauce poured over top.  It makes a great dish!  Nice and sweet and flavorful!  This is a favorite for us!  Add some cayenne for a little spice!",

And the oregano that was put in the breading definately did not go with the sweetness of the glaze either. Maybe it's just me but I didn't like this dish at all. I ate one piece and threw the rest in the trash.",
