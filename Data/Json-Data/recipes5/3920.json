I coated it with the oil herbs and stuffed it with garlic and let it marinate about 30min. then I cut a couple small pieces off and set aside for the sauce. I then grilled the meat. The meat pieces and the extra marinade I put in the pot in place of the meat drippings and then added the other sauce ingredients and extra herbs. It was absolutely to die for. My husband said it was so good he's not sure why we bother going out to eat haha",

Increased all the spices to at least 1 teaspoon each and tripled the garlic (of course I live for garlic); you can put your choice of favorite spices in there but Tarragon is a must retied the roast tightly. Preheated a cast iron skillet with olive oil to very hot covered the roast with seasalt and fresh ground pepper and seared it on all sides before sticking it in the oven with a teaspoon of rosemary bits sprinkled on top because I love the smell of it! I wouldn't dream of having this yummy dish without B\u00e9arnaise sauce that is also classic for Chateaubriand but the addition of shallots & Crimini mushrooms to the recipe sauce made it super yummy for me. Spoon the recipe sauce over for plating but have the B\u00e9arnaise in a side dish for dipping plus the classic Chateaubriand in France always has Chateau Potatoes which are also yummers with the B\u00e9arnaise! I always use a good Cabernet when cooking with red wine; don't cook with wine that you wouldn't drink the quality matters! Enjoy!",

The meat should be in a roasting pan on a rack and the water sits underneath for moisture. Don't set the meat in the water.
