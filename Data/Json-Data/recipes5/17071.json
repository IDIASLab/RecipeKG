I did however use a salmon filet rather than a whole salmon as that is just too much for us unless we have company.  I don't think it would matter what cut of fish you used as long as you don't over cook it.  I put the filet in one of those fish holders for the bbq since it sticks to the grill.  Dipping the cooked fish in the leftover sauce is a good idea.  I have yet to find one person who doesn't like this recipe and I've made it quite a few times now. The sauce is so rich and yummy - come to think of it, I'm going to make it for dinner tonight! Thanks for a good one!  PS  I bet this sauce would make the most delicious chicken wings.",
