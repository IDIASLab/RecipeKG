For the cake I used 3 Tbsp of milk and 2 tbsp cocoa for a single batch. Because it sets up so quickly I made 2 seperate double batches, one for the middle of the cake using the original thick recipe, frosted it, then made the second double batch tweaked for spreadability for the outside of the cake. It is glorious... and I don't even like chocolate!",
