Usually my guys prefer white meat over dark but I haven't seen drumskins get eaten so fast as when I used this recipe. Thanks Grampa Dave!",

I have made it omitting the maple syrup and brown sugar and only using about 1/2 of the molasses that are called for (it's still plenty sweet from the ketchup and OJ).  I really like the use of citrus for the acid it gives the sauce and the onion and garlic round out the flavors.  I also have found that a tsp of chili powder is a nice addition.  thanks, Grampa Dave!",

I followed the recipe exactly on the 1st batch and found it had a wonderful lemon tang to it once cooked. At first I worried it might be too citrus for our likes... but I was wrong. The citrus tang settled down perfectly once it was added to the meats. Try this on chicken thighs cooked on your outdoor grill. Great!!! Today we added it to pulled pork sandwiches (using Sarge's EZ pulled pork recipe on this site) and once again - everyone kept commenting on it. My 2nd batch I tinkered by adding a teaspoon of liquid smoke. Though it gave it a little more depth and changed the complexity slightly our family seemed to prefer it without (we tried them side by side). Just wanted to tell you we thought it was a definite HOME RUN!!! Thanks for sharing.",

I think I will add a tablespoon of chili paste or some chipotle peppers to give it some heat and blend it in a blender to mop on the ribs.....but what a difference in taste compared to bottled sauce! It's like an explosion of flavor in the mouth. Such depth and complexity. My only warning is to be careful about grilling. The sugars quickly catch on fire on the grill....add at the last moment or even after the ribs come off the grill. Oh...and don't try to half the sauce (I did by mistake). The thickness will be off.",
