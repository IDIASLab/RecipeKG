My husband ate two plates full.  In fact everyone in the family really liked it--even my extremely picky 7 year old son.  After much negotiating to get my son to try a bite of pork chop, I knew he liked it because he didn't run and spit it out.  When I asked him if he liked it he told me no, but about 2 minutes after he swallowed the first bite he asked me for a plate of the pork chop.  THIS IS A KEEPER!  I will be making this VERY EASY recipe often.  The pork chops turned out so tender and the sauce is awesome!  Thank you so much for sharing this!!!",

Moist fell apart in the crock pot perfect. I think what happens is the brown sugar and the salt from the soy sauce (I used lower-salt) effectively tenderize the pork chops. Cooked slowly with the soup finishes them off (not to mention makes an awesome gravy)! Will definitely make again - thanks for a great recipe!:)",

Served with a pot of steamed white rice...It was quick and easy and gone in a flash. My teenage son ate three...he loved them and I did too. Thanks for a great easy recipe.",
