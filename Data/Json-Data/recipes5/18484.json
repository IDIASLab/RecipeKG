I used a little more brown sugar and added 2 cloves of garlic. Sprinkled sage on the pork chops added caraway seeds and about another tbsp brown sugar to the sauerkraut after rinsing and squeezing it to get the sour juice out and then put about 3 tbsp thinly sliced butter pats on top of the sauerkraut and then poured about 1/4 cup Reisling wine. Cooked at 250 degrees for 3 hours and it was fantastic. The pork chops were super tender the flavors of everything else were super complimentary. I am going to make this a New Year Tradition!",
