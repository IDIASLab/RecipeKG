And instead of heavy cream I used 2% fat milk. My fish began to crumble when I put the other ingredients in so I stirred everything in except for the rice and created a gumbo-like mixture. I forgot to put in the spinach but it turned out delicious anyway. I placed the mixture over a bed of boil in the bag rice because I have not perfected my rice cooking skills. It turned out excellent. It reminded us of a Pappadeaux menu item. My husband was extremely pleased and I will most definitely make this again. Thank You",

If you're browsing this site looking for something to do with those fillets you've got in the freezer, STOP LOOKING NOW!!  You've found it!\n\nFirst of all, I recommend serving it over rice instead of pasta.  I've tried both, and rice just seems to fit better.  Secondly, the amount of liquid listed in the recipe is nowhere near enough.  I use 2/3 cup cream and 1/3 cup lemon juice (for 4 fillets).  I also use more jalapenos, enough to fill 1 cup when diced.  Usually that amounts to about 4 largish ones or 6 smaller ones.  Finally, the listed amount of cayenne pepper might be a little too strong for some people, especially with the increased amount of jalapenos.  I use 1/4 teaspoon and it still packs a nice punch without burning your mouth off.\n\nFollow the directions as listed, except mix together the sauce ingredients (except the spinach and tomato) in a measuring cup FIRST.  If you add them all the skillet one by one, mixing them will be impossible without breaking up the tilapia.  When mixing in the spinach later, add a little bit at at time to make mixing it in easier.  Put the rice (or pasta) on the plate first, then top it with the sauce and fillets.  Finally, I recommend sprinkling the chopped tomato over top of the fillets after they're on the plate.  That way the tomato pieces will stay firm, and plus it adds a lot to the presentation.\n\nBon appetit!",
