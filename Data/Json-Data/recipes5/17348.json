These remind me of the trademark Rolos chocolate caramels only these of course are better. Having made this recipe several times over the last few months however I wondered why I had such trouble melting the butter/chocolate mixture and keeping it workable while I finished dipping the caramels. The chocolate would stiffen far too quickly and getting it back to a workable consistency was more difficult the second time round. I decided to read the reviews in an effort to discover what I might be doing wrong and though my particular problem wasn't mentioned I did read of one reviewer who suggested eliminating the butter from the chocolate mixture. I hoped this would solve my problem and voila! I was not disappointed; the unadulterated chocolate mixture was now smooth and creamy and remained workable for a longer period of time. Butter or no however I'd recommend having a little more than a pound of chocolate on hand. I've never managed to get by with only a pound. I use Callebaut milk chocolate chips for this recipe and others and am never disappointed. A good quality chocolate should be used because its flavour and texture are superior to that of cheaper varieties. To keep costs down I purchase Callebaut milk chocolate in the bulk section of my grocery store. This recipe will always have a place in my recipe box. Thanks Cheryl!",

Dipping each caramel in chocoloate seemed like too much work for me, so I poured half of the caramel in the pan, sprinkled a layer of semi-sweet chocolate chips and poured the rest of the caramel over it.  A fraction of the work with all the flavor!",

Wrap in freezer paper & put in a nice jar, candy dish, or tin. \nAlso be sure you get to the right temp or you will get candies that are hard if to hot, or really chewy if to cool. And for those getting a grainy chocolate you can take out the butter altogether or use a 1/2 of food grade coco-butter (or 30% of your chocolate ratio) this makes for a wonderful chocolate experience too. Also keep your chocolate over a double boiler on the lowest heat possible, this will keep it at a dipping level. Instead of the dipping method I like to pour a layer of chocolate in a wax papered lined Pan (or over my marble block) let it set completely then pour my carmel over this, let it set up. Cut into squares & slightly separate the squares, or put them on to a cooling rack with a cookie sheet under them, then slowly pour your remaining chocolate over each. You can then reheat the chocolate that drips off and repeat process. This will  get a uniform & perfect coating over each candy. They look like you bought them from a fancy chocolate shop, ;c)  it sounds hard but it is much easier to get a good coat with out all the mess, dipping, & fork marks. I have had a lot of holes and marks in my candies, lol.. I love that I figured this out. Thank u to the one who posted this recipe, it's great!!",

Together this created a real treat. My tip for getting them to stay their shape and look pretty is cut them into squares and then refrigerate them so they're cool when you put the warm chocolate on them. The best way I've found to put chocolate on them is to use a pastry brush and just pick up the caramel and paint the bottom then the top. It works wonderful and they look great. I then put them on wax paper and put in the fridge right away. I found some great chocolate boxes and accessories at Michael's craftstore and I'm going to gift these for Valentine's this year. The caramel taste of this treat is very addicting...Enjoy.",

The caramels are rich and creamy and so flavorful. Next time I make them though I will keep half of the batch without chocolate because after a few days the chocolate gets a little bit crusty/grainy.
