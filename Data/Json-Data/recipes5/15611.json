I did not use the Catalina Dressing because taco salad is supposed to have fresh salsa as the dressing in my opinion. I also like fresh guacamole on top. It was a hit at my house. I also substituted Best Black Beans from this site in place of the Kidney Beans. This also enhanced the flavor of the dish. This was an absolute party in your mouth!!!!! I do not think it would have been as good as listed. So should I give less stars? Heck No!!!! You inspired me and that is what this site is all about. Way to go!!!!",

I have to say they really smelled good while cooking and mixing it in with the ground turkey made you think you were eating ground beef. Really tasted wonderful earthy is what comes to mind. I used my own taco seasoning mix and canned black eyed peas (all I had). This was a great summer meal so easy to make also...not to mention good for you. For the dressing I used Dorothy Lynch Style Salad Dressing from this site that I had leftover just added in a bit of the taco season. My beef loving husband even said it was good.",

So..I used a 1/4 cup of a MILD salsa I had on hand, and a variety of seasonings (cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, child powder, oregano, cinnamon). Sorry just shook them in, no measurements. As another reviewer indicated, I used black beans rather than kidney (not my favorite bean). Diced one garlic clove, and used Arugula and Kale mix as the salad base. Arugula has a peppery flavor which enhanced the mixture. DELISH. Used a mild salsa as the salad dressing. It was a hit. Will definitely make this again, excellent base recipe that one can use ones imagination to enhance.",
