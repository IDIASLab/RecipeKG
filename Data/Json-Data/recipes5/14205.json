I usually make Pico de Gallo but was looking for more of a Taqueria-type salsa for a dish I was making. This fits the bill. This type of salsa is sometimes referred to as 'Ranchero' salsa.

Sadly I had to cut out all but 1 jalape\u00f1o and that was small because my mom can't take any heat. But the flavors were good and this is one of those really good base recipes. I later decided I wanted a chunky salsa so added one large fresh diced tomato. On tasting it with my chips it needed salt so threw in a pinch. I've been making salsa crude for years and with the added tomato lime and salt this is exactly what I was looking for in restaurant table salsa. Thanks!",
