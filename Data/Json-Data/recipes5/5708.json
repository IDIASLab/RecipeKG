I will cut back on the curry to 1/2 tsp if I make this again. I like chicken salad with grapes but I don't think the avocado added much and I love avocado. IMHO the sweetness of the fruit was not enhanced by the avocado or vice versa. I would like to try this again with the papaya leave off the avocado and cut back on the curry. I will also omit the water chestnuts since there was plenty of crunch from the almonds and the celery.",
