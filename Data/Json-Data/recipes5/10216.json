I added 1/2 of the sweetener (powdered swerve) to the toasted coconut and lime topping and... well... it made the topping super sweet and after mushing in my mouth with the custard and crust, it was perfect.

The problem is that the Allrecipes nutrition calculator doesn't factor in NET CARBS so the amount of carbs listed is actually higher than what is really in the bars. I used Swerve as the sweetener here and while Swerve does contain 3-4 g of carbs per teaspoon the ingredients in Swerve do not affect blood sugar so the carbs it contains are considered non-impact. Because of this a common practice is to subtract fiber and sugar alcohols from the carb total make it ZERO carb. This is why Swerve is a top sweetener for the keto diet. I have calculated the correct carbs for this recipe and it is 5.1 grams per servings not 17.8. ENJOY!",
