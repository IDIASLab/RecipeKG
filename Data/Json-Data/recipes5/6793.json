On the islands of Aruba and Cura&ccedil;ao, it is known as sopi mondongo. Cooking Puerto Rican food is a bit similar to Island and Spain cuisine; it has a distinctive flavor combined with foreign influences using native seasonings and ingredients. Serve in deep bowls with white rice and avocados.",
