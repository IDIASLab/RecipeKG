Pineapple upside down cake is my very favorite kind of cake...I've eaten half a pan before and this cake I probably shouldn't make very often because I could forsee that happening. I made this on a Tuesday for a Thursday birthday so I added a little extra pineapple juice and buttermilk as well as maybe 3/4 c applesauce and the cake couldn't have been more moist. I used cherries instead of the currants but otherwise kept everything else the same. I'm not sure if I liked the almonds but the cake was fantastic regardless.",
