I like the use of brown sugar and more spice than the norm. I always dbl the spice in my pumpkin pie. Since I only had a 15 1/2 oz can of pumpkin this is the recipe I used. I didn't have pecans or walnuts so used sliced almonds instead and added flaked coconut for some crunch. I cut the melted butter back to 3/4 cup. It was served with fresh whipped cream and it tasted delicious.",
