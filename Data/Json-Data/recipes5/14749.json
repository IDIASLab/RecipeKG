All I know is that it's yummy and it carries me through those days when my avocados are just not soft yet or when they are not in season (I'm based in Israel and we have food seasons). A girl's gotta have something to spread on her sourdough bread in the morning, you know what I mean. It is also just plain good! All the recipes I have found in the past require me to soak my cashews before but that requires me to plan. And I'm not good at that!",
