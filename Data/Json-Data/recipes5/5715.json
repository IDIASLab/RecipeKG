I was looking for a dairy free shrimp scampi type dish and came across this. Five stars for the idea, flavor, and amounts of spices and oil. I loved the olive oil, lemon, garlic, parsley, and red pepper flavors together. Changes: I used about 1/2 tsp of red pepper--even that might be too much for some, I suggest starting there or less and add more as needed unless you like spicy. I used 2 small squash instead of squash and zucchini. I substituted 8 oz of mushrooms for half the shrimp. I substituted finely sliced almonds for pine nuts--the crunch and nutty flavor was really nice in the dish. I substituted a can of drained diced Italian tomatoes and a handful of cooked asparagus that I chopped for the spinach. I used linguine instead of spaghetti. The combination I used was wonderful. One change I would make would be to add the pasta a little at a time to the vegetables and shrimp, in case you have too much pasta.",

I made as directed, a little heavy on the pine nuts because I like them. I lightly browned the pine nuts before adding other ingredients. The hot pepper flakes added lots of flavor and just a slight heat. Thank you for this fantastic recipe, I look forward to making again especially when my garden veggies come in.",
