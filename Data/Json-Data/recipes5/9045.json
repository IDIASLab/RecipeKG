A good recipe but needs a little more flavor; next time I'll try fresh tarragon and plenty of it, and I had to add salt, but that's a nice change from too-salty casseroles.",

I still used a T & I'm thinking a fresh T would be too much; but what do I know?! Heavy whipping cream sure gives a rich flavor. This to me uh pretty bland. 'Not that it was bad just needs some help. Maybe a little sherry or white wine? Soy sauce?",
