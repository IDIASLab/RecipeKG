My husband and I both preferred the boneless skinless. We also soaked the lentils about a 1/2 hour before using them and cooked the chicken alot longer in the skillet right off and then longer in a dutch oven on the stove. It is very tasty.  I added cumin and basil and omitted the rosemary, as my husband is arab and this dish, done this way, is more like his own culture's food. Also, I added extra lemon.  Great dish and eay to make.",

I also left the salt until last since salt prevents the softening of pulses.  I used a jar of olive tomato sauce and I served it over macaroni.  It was absolutely wonderful, what a great lentil recipe, thanks!  (By the way, if you're using red lentils, you can probably stick with the cooking times.  Brown lentils take the longest to soften.)",

The chicken came out very tender. I had to add about an extra cup of water as the lentils cooked.   I actually thought that the flavor was delicious before adding the tomato sauce, so I might try omitting it next time for a change.  Definitely use fresh rosemary if you have it on hand, and don't skip the lemon juice -- it really brings the flavors together at the end.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I used 1 tsp fresh basil instead of 1/2 dried because my husband, the food snob, said that dried basil is really to be used when it can cook for awhile for the flavors to escape. We all liked it and then, my husband put a few drops of a very nice Balsamic vinegar and some long shavings of parmesean reggiano cheese on it for garnish and wow!  I thought it was good but when he did that, I knew what the others were talking about when they said it needed something more.  I will add the Balsamic after the lemon juice from now on.  Thanks!

This recipe was quite filling very satisfying... I used red lentils; they soften much quicker than brown and gave the dish a saucy consistency (I served over spaghetti). I also used salsa rather than tomato sauce. I really enjoy spicy food so this gave it an extra little kick. Thank you to the person who made that suggestion! Very much appreciated! A tiny bit of grated ginger also tastes great! For vegetarians out there tofu substitues well for the chicken. I would recommend cubing and sauteing in some oil for about 2 mins (extra firm tofu) Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!",
