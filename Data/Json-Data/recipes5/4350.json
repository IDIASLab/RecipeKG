There really wasn't quite enough sauce for that. I added 1/2 cup beef broth and a pckg. of crimimi mushrooms to the pot. Actually the meat took more like 2 hours or so to cook... but it was well worth the wait. Very tender fall apart and delish over the egg noodles! Great flavor but next time I'll make sure to have enough chicken broth in the house! In any event.... it's a definite addition to the \"do again\" file. Thanks!",

I used the same amount of flour and garlic powder that were suggested for the beef coating it actually seemed to be a little too much and had plenty of flour leftover to toss. I also sped up the cooking time a bit to about one hour since I usually don't like to spend more time than that on dinner. I browned both sides of the meat like it said and poured one can of chicken broth 3 tsp of lemon juice 2 tsp of minced garlic sea salt and lots of pepper. I brought the juice to a boil on medium/high heat and covered the pan. I left the meat and steam cook on medium heat for about half hr on one side and then turned meat over for another half hr since broth did not engulf entire meat. After meat cooked I took it out onto a cutting board to cut into thin slices. I added cornstarch to the juices to thicken and then I added the sliced meat back into the juice/gravy. I boiled a few potatoes and propped open some canned peas as sides. I personally mashed my potatoes with a fork while they were still hot and added the gravy all over them and the meat...it was delicious!",
