I also ad a regular sized can of medium rotel. That\u2019s the key. The extra soup and rotel!! I also add a bit of garlic powder or you can even saut\u00e9 your cubes chicken with some fresh mashed garlic before adding. Also important to add 2/3 of the cheese INSIDE the casserole and the rest on top. No good with it all in top. I also like cheddar Monterrey jack blend. Other wise this is soooo easy and the best for pot licks because even cooler it\u2019s till relishes!",
