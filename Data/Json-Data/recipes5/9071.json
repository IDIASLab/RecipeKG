The flavors are perfect with the lemon coming through just a little. Easy and much healthier in comparison to pan frying. Perfect served with a side salad. I have a different air fryer, which doesn\u2019t require preheating so my cook temp was a little higher, but they were done within 13 minutes\u2026I just started with 10 minutes, rotating trays after 5 minutes and then watched em for about 2-3 minutes more. The lemon slices underneath the patties was ingenious and the first time I haven\u2019t complained about cleaning my air fryer racks too. The only change I made, which was to taste preference, was adding a couple more pinches cajun seasoning and a little more lemon juice in the aioli. Will definitely be making this recipe again! Thanks for another great recipe, Bren!",
