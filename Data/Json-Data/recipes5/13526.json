                "reviewBody": "Used 2 real eggs instead of egg substitute. Great recipe! Most pumpkin pie type recipes call for condensed milk. All condensed milk I know of contain the ingredient Carageenan in them & we have severe issues mentally we can directly link to Carageenan & also Annatto, and MSG (Google hidden MSG,too). Sweetened condensed milk has it in it, too. Google search Cornucopia Institute & Carageenen in foods and you'll see products they know of that have it in it & alternate products that don't have any to help you get started. (But no condensed or sweetened condensed milk.) It's one of the most inflammatory ingredients out there & it's in grocery store items, but also rampant in health food stores. Labs give it to animals to put them into a highly inflammatory state in their bowels so they can do studies on them. No other ingredient puts their lab animals into such a highly inflammatory state so quickly than Carageenen does. Cut it out and see what happens in your house. After seeing the affects in my family, making the connections, removing it & seeing the difference mentally / emotionally for us I consider it like poison. Anyway this recipe tastes great!",

It was a nice custard but not very easy to get out of the pan nicely. I think the spices could use a little tweaking maybe a little more cinnamon and a touch of cloves. I did use whole milk real sugar and real eggs. I will make this again but will probably tweak it to fit my preferences. Thanks for posting a nice basic recipe.",
