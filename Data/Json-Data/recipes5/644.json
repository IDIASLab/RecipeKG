Mine was a deep dark brown when I checked on it after 6 minutes. I don't know if that's because I have an Air Fryer Oven. The bottom was not done so I could not flip it because it was still stuck to the parchment paper. I wound up turning down the temp to 275, cooked it for 2 more minutes and then I was able to flip it. I cooked the 2nd side for another 2 minutes.I liked it but I don't think I will make it again.",
