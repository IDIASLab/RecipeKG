Made as written except for adding some garlic powder to the potatoes along w/ the salt and pepper while they were baking and flipping them 1/2 way through so they would brown evenly. They were great as is but I think next time I will add some green onions and maybe a bit of salsa or taco sauce to the top as well just for a little something extra. What a fun twist... I will def be making these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I sliced my potatoes 1/4 in. thin added some taco seasoning spices to them along with olive oil. We grilled them on a cookie sheet on our gas grill over indirect heat at 425 since we try not to use the oven in the dead of summer. We turned the potatoes after ten minutes and cooked 5 to 10 more minutes. Great meal and so easy to prepare...a new favorite for us. Thanks lois.",

With the 8 oz. of ground beef I made my usual taco meat and added 1/2 a can of black beans. I didn t measure the rest of the ingredients just used what I thought looked right adding green onions. I didn t have guacamole so I served this with chunky salsa along with the sour cream. While I thought this was good halfway through dinner I found myself eating the toppings with tortilla chips and leaving the potatoes behind on the plate. Who knows? Maybe I was getting full. I have some of the meat/bean mixture leftover that I will use on a taco salad tomorrow night!",

However as I mixed together the beans and meat it looked like...something inedible. I felt bad serving it to my sons, who ate it politely. Sorry.\n\nI think traditional nachos are the way to go. Potatoes don't have the same *crunch* no matter how long you roast them. The hot bean and meat mixture makes the potatoes soft and indistinguishable. It's like beans on top of giant beans with bits of ground beef here and there. Get the picture? \n\nKeeping the beans and beef separated might improve the recipe. In addition, I'd nix the taco seasoning, and add just a little chili powder and salt to the ground beef.",
