Just poured it into the mayo jar, shook it, and poured it back as a creamy version. Frugality at its finest!",

Not all of us were born knowing all there is to know about cooking and ingredients. Not all stores carry some of the lesser used ingredients, especially when you get into the smaller cities and rural areas. A person should be able to ask a question without an arrogant remark being given instead of an answer. I think you owe the questioner an apology, and the rest of us for having to read your comment. \nAs far as this recipe goes, I loved it, and will experiment with the bottoms of all varieties of condiment jars and bottles. Thanks for getting my creative side working!",

Served with a simple salad of Boston lettuce endive radicchio and baby cucumbers. Will definitely make this or a variation of it when my mayo jar is next empty. Thanks!",
