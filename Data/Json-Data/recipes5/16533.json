A little fiddly to shape but just dump a small amount in a little pile (drop them off a small spoon...dont even try to shape them). I dusted them with some icing sugar at the end which gave them a special touch! Fantastic everyone should give them a go!",

Don't get me wrong these taste really good when they come out of the oven. The problem is the texture. They really don't puff up and look the way they do in the picture. They really just end up being piles of chopped nuts help together by a sugary glaze. They totally fall apart when you try to eat them. I have a feeling these would be really great if you ground the almonds down to almost the consistency of flour but I don't have the patience to try them again to see.",
