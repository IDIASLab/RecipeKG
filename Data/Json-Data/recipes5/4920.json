Light and refreshing with an interesting and delicious contrast in flavors colors and textures. Since spaghetti squash can vary so much in size and since mine was small I didn't measure the rest of the ingredients for the salad exactly - just tossed them in until I liked the proportions. I also left the peel on the cucumber for added nutrition and color. I loved the lemon in the dressing rather than the heavier and tangier vinegar but it was too much even tho' I omitted the zest altogether. In hindsight I'd still leave out the zest (a tablespoon of lemon zest is a lot!) but reduce the lemon juice by half as well. Because fresh garlic is already included in the dressing I simply used table salt rather than the garlic salt called for and that worked well for me. This was so good I couldn't stop digging into it right after I made it while it was still at room temperature and I found I actually preferred it that way than after it was chilled! In my opinion making the adjustments with the lemon easily makes this a 5-star recipe. This is excellent.",

I think adding feta cheese could improve it but overall I don't think I'll make this again. It was a lot of work and not worth it plus what waste of expensive kalamata olives!
