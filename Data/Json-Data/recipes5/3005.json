                "reviewBody": "Great as a starting point, but in my opinion this needs some work.  First, I used only half the vinegar called for yet Hubs and I both thought it was still too tangy. Also, this is a creamy white dressing, so I thought white wine vinegar was a better fit than the red, of course my preference would be to leave the vinegar out altogether - there's plenty of tang in the lemon juice.  I tasted this after I mixed it up and the Worcestershire was very prominent.  It settled down some as the flavors had a chance to marry, but I'd still either cut back on the Worcestershire or, again, leave it out altogether.  I definitely liked the additions of the chives, shallots, Dijon and celery seed, but still felt it needed an extra herb...I added fresh dill.  Finally, as a salad dressing (as opposed to a vegetable dip) it was a little thick, remedied easily enough with a little more buttermilk.  Once I tinkered with it to suit our tastes, Hubs and I both loved this, which we enjoyed on a tossed green salad.",
