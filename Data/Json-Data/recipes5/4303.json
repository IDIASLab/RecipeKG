It had just the right amount of kick for me but was to hot for my mother (but she thinks mild salsa is a bit too hot!). You won't be disappointed with this one!",

For the chile-garlic sauce I used LaChoy Ginger Garlic paste (because it was what I had on hand) & it was perfect! I think it gave it a very subtle exotic flare. My husband said \"this is awesome!\" and that's high praise for him. I made this to go along with perch fresh from the Adirondacks. So I think this would nicely accompany any fish. It was also great for dipping french fries in. Definitely won't ever buy prepared again!",
