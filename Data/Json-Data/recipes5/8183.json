I found a jar of pimento-stuffed green olives which I sliced and mixed in and it made all the difference.  I would imagine feta would work too, it just needs some kind of flavor punch.  I would definitely make this again, as it is a great dish to bring to picnics or potlucks where there will be a vegetarian.  Soooo good!  Even my meat-and-potatoes boyfriend who shuns anything either ethnic or vegetarian loved it!!!!!!!",
