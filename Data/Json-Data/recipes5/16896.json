I cut off about a 3/4 cup chuck of it and soaked it in 3/4 cup of water. Then I had to strain all the seeds and fiber from it...squeezing the pulp into a bowl. Then I went on to the next steps. I used one tablespoon of brown sugar blend about 1/4 cup raisins (as I didn't have dates) and the cumin SEEDS. Well after running it through the food processor the cumin seeds were mostly all intact which I didn't want. So I strained it again....came out perfect. I think next time I would just use ground cumin...like maybe 1/4 to 1/2 tsp depending on how much you like that flavor. Thanks Rani",

I found it slightly mild (heat wise) for my taste so I added 1/4 cup liquid from a jar of hot banana peppers. Also after it was cooked but need to reduce longer I strained it to get rid of any lumps of tamarind skin coriander seeds cloves cinnamon bark etc.. It has been a big hit with everyone.",
