I also added some chopped kalamata olives instead of salt and threw in some green beans and about a tbsp of oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes. I served it at room temperature but it would also be delicious chilled or hot. This recipe is really a great starting point for many variations. One thing to note though is that angel hair pasta should not be cooked as long as the recipe directs. Check the label on your box--it's 3 minutes for dry at most and about a minute for fresh.",

It makes a great standard tuna salad recipe alternative -- not too much mayonnaise and no dang hard-boiled eggs!",

I think however that I'd prefer using rotini or penne--spaghetti and angel hair are just too hard for me to mix! I also added more capers--2 teaspons is just not enough for me but then again I really like them. Otherwise I think this is great. it's very quick and easy too and as other's have said very light and fresh. A perfect pasta salad for my tastes. Thanks for the recipe!",
