Get your pan screaming hot - I used Grape Seed oil, as it has a high smoke point - place your wrapped scallops into the pan - don't over crowd them - and DO NOT MOVE them.  The temptation is to shake and move the scallops around but hands off!  About 3 minutes, give them a flip and the same thing with the other side.  Let them sear without moving them.  Have everything else for dinner ready and waiting.  I served these with a lovely salad with sliced oranges, red onion, baby lettuce and sliced mushrooms.  What a perfect meal.",

We used our 1000W microwave to pre-cook the bacon. We had 4 slices on a plate for 2:30 on high. Then when searing in the oil, they became perfectly crispy. We made about 20 scallops at a time.
