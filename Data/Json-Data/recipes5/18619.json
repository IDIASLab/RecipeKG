I was only able to put about 3/4 of the water that the recipe called for and was worried that it would be salty but it wasn't.  Also, it would have helped dissolve the salt in hot water and then add the rest of the water.  I added salt and it kind of just sat at the bottom.",

For those concerned about keeping your \"bird\" cool, clear out your crisper drawer to submerge your bird.  Steady, even temperature with no danger of spoiling!  2.)  Brined turkeys cook faster ~ monitor your bird closely so it will not overcook!!!  Enjoy!",

Also, DON'T BRINE A TURKEY THAT IS MARKED \"PRE-BASTED\". I suspect one or the other of these is the issue for those complaining about their bird being \"too salty\" even after cutting back on the salt. Do not cut back on the salt! The rinse and/or the unbasted bird will solve your problem. This recipe is terrific, but the author unfortunately assumed users would know these things. Do try it again!! I add 1/2 can of orange juice concentrate but everything else is the same. If you are using frozen turkey, it should be thawed before brining. A FRESH turkey will always turn out better.",
