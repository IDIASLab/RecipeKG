My guests enjoyed it as well and liked the option of not using tahini.  I don't write too many reviews but I wanted to make sure to give it 5 stars!  All I did differently was use some of the reserved juice from the can instead of water, 2T gave it a good consistency.  It's definitely worth trying!",
