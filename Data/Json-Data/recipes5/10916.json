I only marinated for 1 hr and 40 minutes because my child was yelling \u201ceat!\u201d I then took the leftover onions from the braising liquid and threw them in my vitamix with 1 TBS of brown sugar, Dijon and honey mustard, 3 tbs of white wine vinegar and 1/2 cup olive oil. Served octopus over Greek and smoked sea salt 1 inch roasted yellow potatoes  @450 for 22 minutes. Served the dressing over spinach with shaved aged Gouda.
