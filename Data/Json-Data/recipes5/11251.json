First I substituted 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour 1/2 cup wheat bran for the oats. Second I used 1 heaping c leftover sweet potato casserole instead of the plain sweat potato. Third to combat the thickness of the batter I used an extra half cup of vanilla yogurt and thinned it a little more with some leftover apple cider. I'm sure apple juice milk or water would work fine. The final consistency was similar to traditional pancakes and they cooked fine. For more flavor double the cinnamon add a pinch of nutmeg and try some chopped nuts and raisins.",

I (accidentally) added a tsp. baking powder. I did use oil (although Canola not Olive). I did not use molasses but used 2 tsp. Splenda. Also my batter sat in the fridge for several hours before cooking. It was insanely thick but cooked through easily. It satisfied my need for a no flour/no sugar pancake and my kids had something they could put syrup on. Only four stars just beacuse of the modifications otherwise it would have been five.
