I also added a few drops of liquid smoke so the spread would have a \"smoked salmon\" flavor.  Otherwise, I followed the exact recipe.  It was very well recieved.  I served it with a combination of crackers, and carrot and celery sticks.  The recipe makes a large bowl of spread.  Right after I made it, I tested it on a cracker and was not terribly impressed.  The next day I tried it again, and it was delicious.  Definitely NEEDS that 8 hours in the fridge for the flavors to properly blend.  When I got ready to leave the party, the salmon spread was almost completely gone.  I'll make this again -- THANKS for the recipe!",

HINT: if using canned salmon be sure to get a brand that is marked \"boneless & skinless.\" I spent forever picking through pulverized fish bones:) My additions: couple drops of liquid smoke for a hint of savory a couple pinches of dill weed and replaced the salt with 1/4 tsp of Penzey's Trinidad Spice which is a mix of salt lemon peel garlic clove & ginger. Not overpowering just gives it a nice layering of flavors. Next time I'll try the recipe as written because it sounds great too! Thanks for the addition to my recipe box",

I used baked salmon that was leftover (I usually have some around to use in salads); low fat cream cheese fat free plain yogurt no salt or worcertshire sauce lemon pepper dry chives onion powder chopped garlic and a bit of sriracha (an asian hot sauce thatalso gave the spread a pinkish color) thus making it with minimal fat and salt. To make it \"smoked\". I added about a capful of liquid smoke ( my answer to having inexpensive smoked items until I can buy my own smoker as smoked salmon around her runs 20.00 a pound). It came out really yummy. I served it on toast points with a sprinkle of paprika to give it a more festive look. All I can say was it was all gone in minutes. I will definitely make this again.",
