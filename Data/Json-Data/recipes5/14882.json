Cooked on high 1 hour then low for 7.   It literally fell off the bone taking it out of crock pot!  Under the broiler it went for about 7 mins to brown skin and it was perfect!

I am only giving it 4 stars because I did make some modifications as suggested by previous reviewers and I feel like it wouldn't be a 5-star recipe without those modifications. Here's some helpful tips: if you are using a completely defrosted standard Butterball 3-lb boneless turkey roast, you will only need 1/2 of the spice mixture--if not less--also, I used my thermometer/timer gadget, and the turkey hit 165 degrees at the 4 hour mark, lastly, I only used 1/2 packet of onion soup mix (it was all that I had) and I think if I would have used any more than that, it would have been WAY too salty and artificial-tasting, and instead of using water, I used apple cider, since my dressing recipe has chopped apples in it. It turned out flavorful, tender, and the drippings made a killer gravy!",

They said don't change a thing, but I will cut back cook time since it was a smaller breast next time. Only mods were to add some poultry seasoning, some  herbs de Florence instead of just basil and no seasoned salt because I had none, and used chicken stock instead of water. I also added logs of celery, baby carrots and one onion, chunk cut. Awesome! Family said they could eat this every Christmas and they cleaned their plates. 4. Lb bone in breast yielded 6 servings with a lot of leftovers. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box!",
