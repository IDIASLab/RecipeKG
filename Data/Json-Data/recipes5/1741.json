Normally I'm a fan of fudge made with marshmallow fluff but this was nice for something different. I agree with the person who said that it could be used as candy filling -- I may experiment with this base for truffles. Two observations: it works best if you stir constantly and add the chips gradually. Also I was out of wax paper and so I just sprayed the pan with cooking spray and left it in the fridge to chill til the fudge was ready. I was pleasantly surprised by how easily it comes out of the pan!",

That has forced me to become creative though and with great results. Everyone ALWAYS asks me about my fudge and comments on how great it is -- they're so surprised when I tell them how easy it is! I've done everything from your standard Chocolate Walnut to Rum Raisin Coffee & Hazlenut Orange Cream and even a Layered Peppermint fudge (with a festive mint green layer sandwiched in the middle) amongst many others. You can add various nuts candy flavorings liqueurs dried fruits zest etc. to come up with your own fantastic flavors. Have fun and enjoy!:o)",
