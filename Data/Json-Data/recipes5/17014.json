Per the other reviews I doubled the chocolate and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup (didn't need to add any applesauce to make up for it, but there is additional fat in the extra 2 squares of chocolate.)  I grated golden zucchini with the skin on and used white whole wheat flour because I try to get as much fiber in as I can for my kids. I used white chocolate chips instead of nuts because my kids won't eat nuts.  They turned out GREAT! Oh, and get this, I was gonna' make frosting, but my 11 year old son (who normally thinks frosting is the best part,) told me not to.  I made a batch of mini-muffins with the batter first and sprinkled them with powdered sugar because the kids were hungry and I was running out of time.  My son had one and said the powdered sugar was perfect, and frosting them wouldn't make them any better!  Try them; you'll like them.",

I was looking for a cupcake recipe that wasn't too sugary (because I worry about all the sugar that kids are fed) for my son's third birthday. I left out the nuts because I wasn't sure if the kids would like them. I added a teaspoon of vanilla just to give the batter a richer taste -- I don't know if it really made a difference or not. I frosted them lightly with a simple buttercream frosting. Delicious! (And the chocolate color hides the presence of the zucchini from picky young ones.)",

I will definitely use these again and would even make them more frequently because it's a treat I can feed my kids that's special yet more nutritious. I did use chocolate icing with sprinkles but lightly--just enough to make the sprinkles stick. update These are also good without icing on top as just plain chocolate muffins! We now make these about once a month freezing half for later in the month and eat them as muffins for snack or desert. Wonderful recipe!",
