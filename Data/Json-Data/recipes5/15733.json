I used chicken breasts, not tenders, adding them raw to the seasoned tomato sauce mixture and cooking it all on LO for 3.5 hrs (less for tenders).  After adding in the rest and topping with the corn muffin mix, I cooked on HI for 1.5 hours.  Next time I'll add diced onion (1 sm) and 1-2 cloves minced garlic to the tomato sauce mixture, but even as is, this was great, and a keeper.  Thanks for posting!",

I also added a can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and green chiles. I omitted the water and just used the juice from the Ro-Tel can. Lastly, I added about a teaspoon of cumin. I know it sounds like a lot of changes but at the end of the day, the basis of this recipe is great. Don't be afraid of the 1 1/2 T of chili powder. I thought it would be quite spicy with that much but it wasn't at all and I added the Ro-Tel too! Don't be afraid to continue what started this recipe in the first place...the pantry raid!",
