As soon as that thought crossed my mind I knew I had to give this recipe a try. When I told my husband what I was planning to make he had the same reaction I did. I ended up serving this on top of chicken fried rice and it was WONDERFUL. Would I eat this dish on it's own for breakfast? Not a chance in the world. They do however make the perfect topper for Asian dishes! Smooth creamy and loaded with umami. A good sub for Maggi sauce is an even mix of soy sauce and worcestershire. EDIT: Can I just say how magnificent these things were the next day after being mixed in with the leftover fried rice I originally served them with? Ohmyword if they were a 4 the first day they're definitely a 5 the second...and seriously how often do you say something like that about eggs?",
