I will say that it ended up quite garlicky -- which was ok as I really like garlic -- but add garlic at your own risk. I wanted it to be more dip-like in consistency so I used my stick (immersion) blender to puree it a bit leaving it a little chunky. Was quite thick this way but SO delicious. It was a big hit at the New Year's Eve party I attended. Be aware that you do really need to leave time to let it sit before serving -- I made it the night before and when I tasted it then it was VERY oniony but by the next day it had blended and tamed nicely. I believe it's mandatory that the onion used be a sweet variety; any other kind would be to harsh I think. If you substitute another kind of onion you'll want to cut back considerably on the quantity and maybe add a pinch of sugar.",
