With a bit of goat cheese in the filling I think this would be GREAT. I plan on trying that (and I'll report back when I do). Post-goat-cheese Report... I crumbled a couple ounces of goat cheese into the filling this time and it was very good. It added a sort of tangy creaminess. I like it better with the cheese than I did without but given the price of goat cheese I probably will go without it next time.",

Once mixed I let it sit overnight in the fridge to blend flavors. Next day INSTEAD OF PHYLLO I used LARGE refrigerator biscuits rolled them out on a Bisquick-powdered countertop and filled as directed making half-moons and crimping edges with a fork. Placed 'em on a greased pizza pan misted 'em lightly with cooking spray & baked 'em in a pre-heated 425 oven for 10 or so minutes. The filling keeps well; you can make a batch at a time for several days or freeze some of the filling for later use. =)",
