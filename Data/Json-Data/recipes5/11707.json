This isn't one of those simply because with the cornbread mix it's too starchy, too bready, too similar to my grandmother's tried and true cornbread dressing. I'd get demoted to the kids table for trampling on her dressing and it's place of honor on our table \ni can see making this for potlucks and BBQ gatherings though. I'd tweak it next time with some added spices like garlic and ground red pepper for flavor and to nudge the heat up a smidge.",
