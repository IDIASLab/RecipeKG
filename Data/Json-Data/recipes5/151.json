If you follow the recipe the whites chocolate ganache is like soup the milk chocolate is ok and the dark chocolate is too thick. I was able to thicken the white chocolate by adding some powdered sugar while beating it. I added some milk to the dark chocolate to thin it while beating it. Once assembled the cake is extremely rich no one could eat more than a few bites. I would not recommend making this cake.",

There was definitely a difference with consistencies among the ganaches but after refrigeration they each worked out fine. I only had 9 inch cake pans so I increased baking temp to 350 and shortened time to 30 min. I wanted it real soft so after chilled it would cut easily. It came out just so and I think the ganache even softened the brownie layers. I also reversed the order of ganache so I'd have white on the top to decorate. I wrote a happy birthday message on top with a bit of the dark chocolate ganache. It worked out great and looked fabulous. It was so divine but quite decadent and rich. Quite a simple cake but it will wow people!",
