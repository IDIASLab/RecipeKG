This turned out wonderfully. I used some of the other commenter's advice: roasted the peppers (low broil for about 20 minutes) WITH the seeds sauteed the onions in butter until translucent and kept the seeds from all the peppers to add to the dip. I skipped the cumin and used 2% milk in a smaller portion to thin it out ever so slightly. I cooked it on low in a dutch overlow heat for 30 mins rather than in a slow cooker. It has a great kick to it -- the kind that warms the back of your throat right down to you chest. I loved it and what drew me to it was the addition of fresh peppers. Many other versions require only a can of tomatoes and Velveeta -- I thought this was far superior. It makes a large portion and I was surprised to see the next day how it refrigerated so well -- same consistency no hard film on top and easy to just heat and serve. I think I'll be bringing this to my next pot luck. Thank you!!",

The only difference was that I sauteed the onions and used jalapeno Anaheim and Serrano peppers because that was what was available at the store. It was surprising mild in flavor. Next time I might add some seeds from peppers as suggested by others for a little spicier taste. Make sure to wear gloves when removing seeds and skin from the peppers. My fingers burned for hours afterwards. We served with soft pretzels and tortilla chips.",

Followed the directions about the roasted peppers but the skins didn't peel off easily. However I pulled off as much skin as possible (only about 1/4 came off each pepper) then chopped finely and the remaining skin was not noticed nor a factor in the dip. I cheated a little and instead of dicing the tomatoes just added 1 can of Rotel Mild tomatoes and chilies. Used FF half and half too. The dip was very mild - really no kick but wonderful flavor. So you could add some hot sauce or more jalapenos to boost the heat.My guests and I could not get enough of this delicious dip. Along with the other reviewers I'll use this queso recipe whenever I want to impress guests. My son prefers the simpler version (Velveeta and Rotel only). Thanks for sharing this recipe Shrimpbait.",
