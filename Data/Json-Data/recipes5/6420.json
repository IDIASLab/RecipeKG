I had three 8.5 oz. fillets so I just mixed up the marinade in a measuring cup and poured a little bit onto each fish while in sitting on their sheet of foil. I then sprinkled the Old Bay salt and ground pepper some minced garlic and the teaspoon of capers topping each with two lemon slices and a sprig of garden fresh rosemary. I then sealed all edges well into a pocket leaving room for the steam to expand. I also let the fish marinate in the foil packets for 30 minutes before cooking. I only made half the sauce since I could only get a tablespoon of lemon zest from my two lemons but it was plenty for us. I just added about a teaspoon of minced rosemary and teaspoon of olive oil a tablespoon seemed a bit much for our taste. I wasn't sure I'd like the sauce but boy it sure was wonderful on the fish. I really wouldn't want to smother the fish with it since the fish was so refreshing even without it. We cooked on gas grill at 400 for 16 minutes and ate them right in the foil packets. This is going on our summer grilling rotation.",
