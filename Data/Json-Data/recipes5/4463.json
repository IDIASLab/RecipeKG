I substituted shredded butternut squash in place of the carrot, and I curried my lentils before adding them with the broth. The curried flavor really carried over well through out the simmering, and the texture was really nice when I used an immersion blender on the whole soup to get everything blended very fine. Overall, I prefer to blend everything rather than leave parts of it chunky. Thank you for the recipe!",
