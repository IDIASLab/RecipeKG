First I doubled all the spices and sprinkled them on onion and let the onion simmer in the oil then I added 5 cloves of chopped garlic and 1/2 a chopped jalape\u00f1o. Then added the beef and cooked until brown 1 can of tomato sauce 1 can of stewed tomatoes 4 cups of water 4 cups of beef broth frozen okra and 2 dashes of lemon juice. And then followed through with the rest of the cooking instructions. My husband did request that I add eggplant towards the end. We loved it the meat was very tender lots of flavor and my hubby said it taste like home.",

I'd poured it over Jasmin rice or just drink as soup/stew - enjoy.",
