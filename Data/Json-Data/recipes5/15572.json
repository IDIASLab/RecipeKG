It needed a little more \"body\" and the beans were just the thing. Probably a can of corn in place of one of the beans would've worked well also.  The spices were perfect--however, I always like a touch of sweetness to tomato based recipes, so I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar....YUM! I would highly recommend this chili recipe---and for anyone that never usually tries ground turkey in place of ground beef, believe me, you'll never miss it.",
