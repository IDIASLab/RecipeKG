                "reviewBody": "This recipe has potential but as written didn't do much for me. First I would saute the onion pepper and the garlic in olive oil instead of the butter - adding some of the butter to the sauce at the end. I would probably not use red onion next time either finely diced sweet white onion or a shallot - the jalapeno didn't add much spice to the dish - the addition of some red pepper flakes would help. Also I would toss the shrimp with some garlic lemon olive oil salt and some pepper flakes and let them marinate for 15 - 30 minutes. In fear of the dreaded over cooked shrimp I did remove them from the pan while I reduced the sauce. I use fresh cherry tomatoes halved mainly because I have a boat load of them and I am not a huge fan of canned tomatoes. So with all those changes I guess it wouldn't be this recipe at all would it?",

I can see where from other review(s) where not using canned diced tomatoes would take away from the original recipe the canned diced tomatoes provided some of the sauce the wine butter and lemon juice \"blend\" with...otherwise it would be very dry and boring. Also for recipes such as this I prefer the flavor of butter over olive oil though obviously the recipe can be modified for a \"healthier\" alternative to butter. I used fresh jalapenos and shrimp being a jalapeno lover added a couple of extra as suggested. Spiciness depends on the quality (and type) of the pepper you are using so I can say that the rendition I produced was plenty spicy enough for me! My family and I will be making this recipe again!",
