This particular version hails from Modena, famous for sports cars and Luciano Pavarotti. This recipe can also be called \"casagai\" or \"cazzagai\". This street food makes a lovely snack or appetizer and is best served with a light red wine. Serve warm as an appetizer or alongside a salad for a light meal.",
