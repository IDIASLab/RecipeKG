I did use butter rather than margarine and cremini mushrooms rather than white but otherwise I followed the directions. I wished that the sauce was a thicker one because for us it really depended on salt to help out the penne which seemed to be almost bland. I would suggest also that the mint was a must for this! I would try tweaking the sauce a little but I can see that for a summer lunch that this would be perfect! Thanks for giving me ideas of what to do!",
