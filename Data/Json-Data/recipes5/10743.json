This simple but brilliant creation features thinly sliced, horseradish-covered roast beef piled high on a freshly baked kummelweck roll. When you add a steaming ramekin of fresh beef jus for dunking, you'll understand why this is the pride of Western New York (sorry, chicken wings). Serve with chips or fries and pickles on the side.",

Every time one of the TV chefs (G.F.) calls us upstate I just want to slap him upside his head. Next, I love your recipes. I've tried many of them and most are easy to accomplish and very good. I'm a home cook with a picky husband so it is sometimes scary to try something new. This recipe is very authentic. I cheat a little using deli roast beef and au jus.",

I typically don't like cooking a roast on a stovetop but it worked out very well and if you have time constraints this is the way to go. Make sure to dip your sandwich in the au jus because it mixes so well with the beef bread and horseradish!! Definitely will be made again!!",
