I cut the marinade in half because I had just two steaks.  I used a bunch of minced garlic instead of garlic powder and also skipped on the hot sauce.  I ended up letting it sit in the fridge with the steaks (top sirloin) for about 3 hours.  When it was time to make dinner, I took the steaks out of the bag and then threw in 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms until they were well coated and dropped all of that into a pan.  I cooked the mushrooms until most of the liquid was cooked out on medium high heat.  Grilled the steaks to medium rare, then served the mushrooms on top!  Turned out very flavorful and very delicious.  Thanks!",

Boy, was I glad I did.  The steaks ended up marinating 3 days (due to changes in plans).  They were so tender, and the taste... fabulous.  This marinade is very subtle, it really enhances the meat well.  I didn't have parsley, so I added a dash of thyme.  My DH was extremely happy with the taste, and wants me to use this recipe again and again.\n***UPDATE***-I wanted something different for Christmas dinner for 15 people, this was my choice, and everyone raved about how flavorful and tender the steaks were (we used flat iron steaks).  I brought the steaks home from the store, fixed the marinade, popped them in the freezer for about a week, then defrosted them Christmas Eve.  My DH put them on the BBQ to cook, YUMMM!  On a busy day, it was an effortless, but outstanding main dish.",

Thank goodness l at least used fresh garlic, but I think both the lemon juice and hefty amount of garlic powder contributed a strong, \"off flavor,\" as one reviewer put it, that I just didn't care for - not so sure I liked the basil either.  It was fun to experiment, but it would have been so much easier and so much better to have just stuck with the simple steak seasonings we're accustomed to.

In fact, if, after tasting \"mixture\", it seems \"to strong for your taste buds\", just an a little water to it.\". I also always add \"a little oil or canola oil\" to the mixture(it depends how much you make, but \"at least a tablespoon\". It tenderizes the steak/pork/or venison\" meat, and gives the flames on the grill a chance to \"dance upward\", giving those nice \"charred lines>\n\nI also use both powered garlic and real garlic. I subsitute lemon juice with \"rice flavored vinegar or wine vinegar. Be sure \"not to over due the acidic ingredients(lemon or vinegars)If you have \"fresh basil leave handy, instead of dry..even better. I always \"freeze \"fresh basil leaves\" in a ziploc baggie, to have handy in the house. Just crush the leaves once from, grab a handful to add to your \"marinades or pasta sauces. Makes a \"huge difference in flavor.\nSometimes, instead of \"soy\", I'll use Terriyaki sauce instead, or sometimes \"a little of each\". Especially with \"pork tenderloins. Even throw in chopped green onions. Once you are \"comfortable making your own marinades, \"the \"skys the limit\". You also , if a tender cut of meat(like pork or beef or venison tenderloin\", do not have to marinate \"more than a half hour\".  Marinades will stay in a glass jar up to a week, if you do not have time to do it \"daily\". I send up a batch with my husband went he goes hunting",
