                "reviewBody": "This should really be called Taco Hamburger Mac! Yum! I made this almost exactly as written and it was delicious! Proportion of ingredients is spot on. I have frequently made Taco Seasoning I (see Cook\u2019s Note on this recipe), but tonight I used a taco seasoning blend that I sell, which worked very well using the measurements in the recipe. I was happy to catch the author\u2019s review indicating a typo of the recipe in which only 2 cups diced tomatoes should be used and not 2 cans. My 1 can yielded very close to 2 cups with juices and was the perfect amount in this recipe. I was out of elbow noodles and subbed with 2 cups Gluten Free (GF) Rotini pasta. All pasta varies in cooking time so be careful if you end up subbing as I did due to dietary restrictions and being out of GF elbow/macaroni. My rule of thumb with IP pasta for cook time is to take the lowest cook time listed on the package (subtract 1 minute if necessary to get to an even number, then divide in half, and subtract 2 minutes. So for Barilla GF Rotini, 8 min/2 = 4 and minus 2 minutes = 2. I set the timer for 2 minutes and had perfectly cooked pasta). Unfortunately, I cannot attest to the cook time of regular elbow/macaroni pasta, but I suspect 3 minutes would be accurate for al dente. As the author suggested in the description, I added 1 cup of grated cheddar at the end. I also topped off our bowls with a little extra grated cheddar. My husband topped his bowl with a dollop of sour cream and loved this dish.",
