                "reviewBody": "This was so fun to make! Definitely a good and EASY Sunday dinner. I made some changes: For the filling, I mixed some chopped up (RAW) chicken, 2 tsp of minced garlic, some dill, salt and pepper and some of the chopped scallions. The raw chopped chicken mixture cooks in 15 minutes like the halibut and is very moist. For the sauce, I only put in half the lemon and I chopped a small shallot for the sauce,plus the scallions, salt, pepper and cream. YUM! My husband (who is very picky) absolutely loved it. \n\nA word about the sauce, I was reading other reviews that people are boiling it longer to lose the lemon flavor.  This will not lessen the flavor, it just ensures that the cream doesn't curdle or is too runny. If you don't like a really tart/lemony sauce, I would reduce the amount of lemon juice to 1 1/2 TBS and boil it down like the recipes states. Don't boil too long or you will scorch the lemon and have a burnt tasting cream sauce.  \n\nAlso, for those who have never used phyllo - its FUN! Don't read the directions on the box, they are too daunting and not necessary. Just thaw the phyllo overnight and take out as many sheets as you need (make sure you have all the ingredients ready though). Lay the phyllo down like a sheet of paper \"landscape\"-wise (like a piece of paper). Brush up and down with butter, if you brush left to right, you will rip the pieces. But if you do rip the pieces, you can't even tell after they bake.  \n\nThanks for the easy and elegant recipe!",

The only changes I made were to use half & half instead of whipping cream and less lemon juice. I used the rest of my phyllo dough package to make dessert: spray a muffin pan with Pam & take one phyllo dough folded into 4ths molding it into the pan - spray again and repeat, alternating the direction of the dough, using 4 sheets per cup. Then sprinkle with cinnamon & sugar & bake. Makes cute dessert cups for fruit with whipped cream, or whatever! A nice dessert with this dish.

To cut way down on the fat, I used CoolWhip instead of whipping cream.  I mixed it first to make it more liquidy.  Came out awesome!  Also, for the lemon juice, I juiced a fresh lemon (you can squeeze or press it) since it's such an important part of the meal.  The sauce was delicious this way and had much less fat!  I made a little extra of it and poured it on some steamed vegetables, which accompanied the meal nicely.",
