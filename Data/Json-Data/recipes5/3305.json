My glaze was very runny, and pooled around the edges and ran down the sides of the cake, too.  Although the outer pieces that got the extra glaze were very tasty, too!  :o)",

The cake was great and people enjoyed it but there was one thing that bothered me a bit which was the color of the cake. It screams YELLOW. I wish there was a way to reduce that fakey bright yellow. Maybe use a pudding rather than a gelatin as another reviewer said that worked fine. Here are the changes I made based on other reviews: 1. Omitted water from glaze 2. Used a bundt pan 3. Reduced baking time by 4ish minutes 4. Poked holes in the top to allow glaze to penetrate. 5. Added the zest of 1 lemon & 1 tsp. pure vanilla to the icing. Other than that texture recipe-ease and taste were all 5 of 5 stars. Thanks!",

Then add another cup of confectioners' sugar and a drop of food coloring and pour the rest. This gives a thicker more colorful glaze. Since my young daughter requested this for her b-day I topped with multi-colored sprinkles. You could add something a bit more sophisticated (lemon wedges?)if serving adults. A keeper!",
