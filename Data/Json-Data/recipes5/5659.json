I let the vegetables marinate for most of the afternoon and added some of my own fresh herbs from the garden (mostly parsley and basil.)  I used a yellow bell instead of red since that's what I had on hand but the beauty of this one is that you can use whatever veggies you want!  Plus, you can put these together ahead of time if you're cooking for several people and have one thing marked off your to-do list.  I can see how this method would be beneficial on the grill as you can cook your veggies easily without having to worry with skewers, also.  Super easy recipe for summer on the grill or you can utilize the oven in the winter (or during torrential downpours on the 4th of July...whoops!)",
