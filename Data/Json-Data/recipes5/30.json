I make it every year & it's probably my favorite \"dish\". I love putting a ton of it on leftover \"best-ever cornbread-sausage stuffing\", which we have also made our whole life! I can't say I use these exact measurements, because we just toss it together, but they seem about the same. The last few years I have made bone broth from the turkey carcass & drippings, then removed most of the fat & save the broth til next time. This way I can make the gravy in advance & have one less thing that needs put together just before dinner. I love chicken livers, so sometimes I buy more & add them if I'm making a large amount, which I usual do. Thanks so much for sharing this, I'll be sharing the link with my kids.",
