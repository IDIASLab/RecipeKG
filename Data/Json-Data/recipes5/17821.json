I used this on the marinated grilled chicken II recipe. DELICIOUS! Simply easy and not too sweet with cutting back on the sugar. This makes a smaller serving amount than stated.

The 3rd time I poured it directly over pork ribs abd baked them for about 1 1/2 hours and ohhhh my goodness! Soooooo delicious!! These were the BEST ribs I have made in a long time if ever! The flavor was AMAZING!! Very very good! And I love that it was so easy to throw together. I am done buying BBQ sauce anymore I'll just make it because its so much better!",
