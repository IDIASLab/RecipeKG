The meatloaf was very good, saved a lot of cooking time and I will definitely add this to my regular meal selections. I'm looking forward to a meatloaf sandwich with the leftovers. :-)",

I made it almost the same except I used ground venison instead of beef. Couldn't tell the difference. The one thing that was missing was a little crust because normally when I make it in the oven I do a freeform loaf to get the \"brown\" on the outside. However the convenience factor MORE than made up for it! Great recipe!",

I have a question.....no matter which recipe I use by the time I get the middle done the edges are hard and burnt. This is such a waste of food cause I have to cut the middle out and eat it. I've tried covering it with a paper towel and I've tried covering it with some Press and Seal (leaving a small opening to let it vent). Is my microwave power set too high? I only cook it for 15 to 20 minutes in a loaf pan. Actually I just tried it at 15 minutes and while the edges where already getting hard you could tell the middle was still a little pink so I had to sacrifice the edges to get the rest of it done. Anyone have any suggestions of what I'm doing wrong?",

So...this is what I didn't like: too much sugar too much tomato sauce. I would skip sugar all together. It smelled great while in the microwave. Didn't look like meatloaf at all. Crumbled when I tried to cut it into slices. Burned at the bottom (too much sugar). Thank heavens I was making sholet at the same time and could use those \"crumbs\" of meatloaf for that and doing so to save the dinner. I think I'll go back to the conventional way of making meatloaf. It was kind of an embarrassed to say the least. I don't think I'll attempt do use this recipe again.",
