Premade my dough the night before and rolled it out while everything else was cooking.  I don't know if I rolled my dough too thick, but it was tearing in the end, so I figured it was thin enough.  My dumplings took almost 20 minutes to cook.  Family liked it so that is a good thing.  Bear in mind, I've NEVER made dumplings before, so this very well could be this cooks error.  I read online that normally dumplings take 20-25 minutes to cook.  Tasty though.",
