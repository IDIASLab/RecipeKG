I had 4 huge fuji apples and didn't think a pie plate would hold all of them so I dumped it in an 8x8 square baking dish.  I tossed the apples and cinnamon in a large plastic bowl so they would be coated on all sides.  I used a full cup of brown sugar only, added a dash of vanilla extract and used some oatmeal along with the flour.  I wish I would have had some caramel sauce to drizzle on top, but I devoured it without it.  Highly recommended!",

I didn't like the walnuts a whole lot so I just did loads of pecans for the second round, it turned out very nicely, almost like pralines.  The first time around I used a much more shallow glass dish, but I found that it ended up being far too flimsy, so the second time around I put my apples (3 courtland, 1 granny smith) into a much smaller square glass pan.  Try using a tablespoon or two of brandy when you're initially preparing the apples for an extra kick.",
