I often use a fresh roasted red pepper instead of those in a jar. I first grill the red pepper and blacken the skin (you can also do that under the broiler) then peel off all the blackened skin and remove seed then throw the pepper in the food processor with the rest of the ingredients. UPDATE - Made this even better...delete the parsley and the salt and add a large clove of garlic and about a dozen kalamata olives (pitted of course!) and about a tbsp. of the brine that the olives come in! EVEN MORE FABULOUS and a good way to get healthy red peppers beans and olives all in one dish!",

It was beautiful and smooth and made a very generous amount of hummus. Thanks for a fantastic 5 star recipe! I also tossed with hot pasta for a delicious entree!",
