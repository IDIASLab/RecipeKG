And they are the most beautiful dark color. Yum! I made as directed but added a pinch or two of salt and then about a tsp of vanilla right before adding the (non-toasted) pecans. Also I put at least a 1/2 cup extra pecans and would've added a few more but ran out. That's just personal preference though. Oh yes and I cooked them for about 19 min rather than just 13 but I know my microwave is a bit weak. Awesome recipe...thanks!",

It is important to use the whipping cream though if you want to keep the creamy buttery taste that distinguishes them from just plain white fudge. Because microwaves differ using the soft ball stage to determine when it is done is important. After nine minutes just swirl a few drops of the cooked mixture into ice water. If it dissipates continue cooking until you can create a soft ball you can lift out of the water. Warning: Though good cooks taste their food don't taste this or any candy until it is ready for the pan. It will scald you. (And yes I've experienced it!)",

I stirred in the pecans and 1/4 tsp. of salt about mid-way through the cooking time. I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract after cooking. I also did the soft ball stage test in ice water. Do yourself a favor and do not even attempt to make these until you know your microwave's wattage. Look inside your microwave for a label that will have the model number. Then do a search online to see what wattage you have. I believe this recipe is geared to around a 1 000 watt microwaves. If your microwave has less than 1 000 watts you may have to cook longer. If your microwave is more than 1 000 watts you will most likely have to cook less. I'm guessing that the people who had trouble with these do not know the power of their microwaves plus they did not do the soft ball stage test. Too bad because these are incredibly delicious if cooked right.",
