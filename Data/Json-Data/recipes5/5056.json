Topped with unsweetened whipped cream, this lovely tart is perfect for a Sunday brunch or dessert on any occasion. Most of you will remember Treacle Tart from the popular book series, Harry Potter. You can also serve treacle tart with clotted cream or vanilla ice cream! The treacle is so sweet that you want to serve it with something not so sweet, so that the flavors balance.",
