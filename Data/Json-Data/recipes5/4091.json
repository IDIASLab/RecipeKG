Very clean and crisp. I added a little more lemon because I'm a lemon nut. Even my semi-picky 15yo loved this one (said \"Good fish Mom\" more than once - which is a lot coming from him). Thank you thank you!",

Instead of arugula I had a spinach-arugula mixture and chopped that up. Threw all of the \"sauce\" ingredients including the chopped greens into a little saucepan on the lowest setting while the fish cooked to meld them together a bit better and allow the flavors to open up. I only flipped it once in the 15 minutes as I would with a beef steak. The result was fantastic. I would do it exactly the same next time.",

I followed Katie Sue's suggestion and mixed the dressing in a small saucepan then added the greens and let it warm up and wilt a bit..on a hot summer day would just serve as a salad. I also served it on the side as swordfish has such a lovely mild flavour I didn't want to \"smother \" it. Enjoyed will make again",
