This is easily customizable to personal preferences. I bet some feta would be tasty too! I'll definitely be making this again! I used the blender jar of my Ninja to \"rice\" the cauliflower and it worked perfectly. Just a couple pulses is all it took.",

My husband thought it was regular couscous. I found it filling a great alternative to a carb. We really like cumin so I substituted it for the thyme and I added shredded carrot to the veggies. Will make it again with some alterations to try to win my daughter over.",

The only change I made was omitting the olives because the main dish had olives in it and hubs is somewhat finicky about olives as it is.
