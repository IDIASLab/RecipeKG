I didn't use the bacon as that counters some of the major health benefits of eating venison and it was still very moist and flavorful without the noticeable difference in texture that we often find with ground venison. I would have never guessed that it was anything other than beef and it was more tender and moist than my usual beef meatloaf recipe! I used a spicy steak seasoning and a spicy BBQ sauce. It was delicious but I will experiment with a homemade or purchased BBQ sauce that is lower in sodium.",
