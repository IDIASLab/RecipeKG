My kids looked at it with a great deal of suspicion but wolfed it down after a tenative taste. We found it was best with a bit more salt and some garlic/chili sauce to give it a bit of kick. The bites with more fresh ginger were also better so in the future I will probably add more. I've also considered some fresh garlic. Give it a try for a great low-calorie start to your day.",

I used half of a green bell pepper and half of a red bell pepper, chopped, for color and texture. I grated the ginger instead of slicing it to fry in oil. I also added a little hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper for taste. I cooked about 7 good size omelets total. These were easy to prepare and tasty. You can use other vegetables in place of these and add different types of meat or use shrimp. Usually egg foo young is served with chinese hot mustard mixed with soy sauce instead of soy sauce or gravy. This defintely tastes like the ones I grew up eating only better!",
