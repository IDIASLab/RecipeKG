It might be nicer if I found a way to make it less thick. Between the coconut oil and the caramelized onions it tasted quite sweet so it would be nice served with salty pita chips or saltier veggies like celery. Or maybe try a bit of salt? Just thinking out loud how I might tweak it for next time. But as I said it's nice at is it and is what it claims to be:)",
