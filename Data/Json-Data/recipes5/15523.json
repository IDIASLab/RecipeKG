I used four cups of chicken broth 1 can of chicken since I didn't have any ground beef 1 can of black beans 1 onion 1 packet of taco seasoning 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and a can of diced tomatoes. I made this soup in the crockpot on high for 3 or 4 hours just so the flavors would meld together. It was insanely good...i couldn't stop eating it and I can't wait to make it again. When it was ready I crushed tortilla chips on top and added sour cream and shredded cheese. 5 stars all the way...and beware...it's addicting!!",

Just brown the beef and saute the onion together in a skillet and drain off fat. Then put all ingredients together in a large pot, bring to a boil and let simmer for 20-30 minutes. It's that simple. \r\n\r\nMy variation: 1lb groud beef, 1 onion, 2 cans kidney beans (with juice), 2 cans corn (with juice), 2 cans diced tomatoes (with juice), 1 can tomato suace, and 1 package taco seasoning. Put a spoon full of sour cream on each serving and toss fritos on top!  Mmmmm!",
