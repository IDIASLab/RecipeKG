I partially pulse blended with a stick blender and then added some instant mashed potatoes to thicken it a little. With these minor tweaks it turned out great. Will make again.",

I probably only did about 6 cups of water, and added a couple tablespoons of Better than Bouillon broth base. So, that equals maybe 6 cups broth. I didn\u2019t put in any plain water. I added another can of black beans, so I used three cans. I would\u2019ve used 4 but I only had 3. Also increased the cumin-I probably used about a tablespoon of cumin. Added a couple teaspoons more brown sugar. Put in a good half cup of chopped cilantro. I kept tasting it and thought it needed more flavor. Added more oregano. Put in a few tablespoons of tomato paste. I still thought it was too thin & didn\u2019t have enough to it, so then I threw in some Minute Rice. After all that tweaking, it was very good. The fresh cilantro in it was very good. I didn\u2019t just use the cilantro as garnish-I added it when I put in the beans and broth in.",
