The earlier review said to add more sauce, I added a half cup more, could have done a bit more, but I have to remember, this is a casserole.  I doubled the reciped, and added 2 tablespoons of italian seasoning.  My friends loved it so much, that they begged for the recipe.  I'll do it again, but next time I want to add cheese on top for that nice crispy topping.  Ooh, I started out with the Wasabi Secret Salad, which was a HUGE hit with this dish!",
