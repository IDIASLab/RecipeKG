The glaze was a perfect accompaniment to my Christmas ham; it was tangy sweet and paired really well with the saltiness of the meat. I grew up learning to put the cloves in after the ham was baked so I did it that way but instead of adding whole cloves to the sauce I added about 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of ground clove with just a dash of nutmeg. I didn't have an orange so I substituted with about 1/2 cup of orange juice. Got rave reviews from friends and family that tried it. This was a real gem of a recipe find for me and I will be using it again this Christmas!",

Once the ham was heated I cooled the whole works down and sliced the ham back into the liquid left from the roasting. Reheated the next day for dinner and it was fantastic!
