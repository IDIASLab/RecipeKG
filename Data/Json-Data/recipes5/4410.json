It's curiously habit forming particularly when one is really hungry. My only modification was using extra virgin olive oil instead of regular olive oil. I was generous with the salt and pepper which makes a big difference in the flavor. Over 50% of the calories are fat calories but I'm okay with that: 1) the fat calories are \"good fat\" from the olive oil and 2) when paired with other healthy dishes the fat percentage of the meal will reduce. I recommend this one!",
