In fact, I purposely make to much roast so that we can have this dish!   I've never made it with the ground beef as others have suggested, but I have made it  with ground lamb.  One way I deviate from this recipe, is to double the ingredients and add extra spices to make the dish more suitable to our taste.    I serve it with boiled basmati or jasmine rice and my sides are Asma\u2019s choice, warm pitas, raita, and finely sliced onions laced with lemon juice.    Leftovers are even better for lunch the next day. This dish is FANTASTIC!",

What i find a little strange is that the spices are added to the meat and water when in fact in Indian cooking spices a fried briefly to release their flavours. I therefore added them to the onions just before adding the meat which i also fried briefly. All in all this is a simple quick and tasty meal. I served it with a little Basmati Rice Naan bread Lettuce with a spoon of Raita on top.",

So I had to give it a try! Glad I did. The flavors are much more subtle than I'm used to but I liked the overall result. Very easy dish. I didn't have tomatoes so tossed in about 1/4 cup picante sauce instead. Also used very lean ground beef (4% fat) and reduced the amount of oil to 2 TBSP. It would've been too greasy otherwise (but I have noticed that food from Pakistani restaurants is very oily so that might be a cultural preference). For anyone who can't find the spices in their area you may order them online from Penzeys.com. I've been using them for years--the quality of spices is excellent and they can be cheaper than the local grocery store.",

For someone like myself who likes spices (yes I also increased the amount of spices used) and wants to increase protein intake this is a wonderful dish. The cumin the heat of the chili powder and chilies and the aroma of the garam masala really blend and flavor the beef well. The only reason I didn't give the recipe 5 stars is because this is essentially a bowl of beef. As Asma suggested warm up some pita bread make the raita (fyi: for those unfamiliar with Middle Eastern cooking she means plain yogurt - not vanilla!) etc. I purposely double the dish so that I can take any leftovers for lunch where I serve the meat on top of lettuce additional tomatoes and a light vinaigrette (sometimes just additional lemon juice but usually a bit of oil and vinegar.)

Even using lean beef mince a lot of extra oil is generated. We served this with rice stir fried swiss chard (with garlic and soy sauce) and the Easy Chickpea Curry on site.
