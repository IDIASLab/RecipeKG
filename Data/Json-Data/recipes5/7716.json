Truly, my partner told me several times how much he liked it (and I cook a lot).  This has a much more subtle lemon flavor than picata. I subbed boneless, skinless breasts, so I skipped the browning step. I also subbed dry thyme and fat-free half & half, 'cause it's what I had and to cut the fat content. Worked fine. Great recipe!",
