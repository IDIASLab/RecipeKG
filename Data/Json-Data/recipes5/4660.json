I cooked thec chicke first and then de glazed the pan before adding the onions/garlic etc. I also added a can of artichoke hearts which was a nice addition.

I split the difference and baked it about 45 minutes. I really like the taste of this...I will definately make it again. I tweaked it a little since I'm a novice and basically a convenience cook. I used a 10 oz pkg. of frozen chopped spinach (thawed) I used 1.5 tsp of chopped garlic and my lemon juice came from a bottle:-). It didn't matter it still tastes great. My fear is that I don't think it will reheat well. I think it will be dry. So I need to figure out what I can add to this to make it a little more moist. All in all a great lighter pasta dish. If you don't like a heavy sauce with your pasta this one's for you!",

Other reviewers have commented on it being \"bland\" - I just add oregano salt pepper to taste and a pinch of dried parsley. Most of the time I make this with spaghetti squash instead of noodles because I can't have wheat pasta and I'm too lazy to make several batches of noodles. It's phenomenal with the squash though! Here's what I do with the squash: use a pre-cooked 3-lb spaghetti squash and cut the spinach and olives back to almost half and cut back a little on the feta but I tend not to measure that part. Then I cook just enough to re-heat everything. (of course cutting back on some of the amounts tends to produce less servings overall - oh well; guess that's what I get for not using wheat-based noodles). Thanks for sharing this recipe and hope my changes inspire rather than offend.",
