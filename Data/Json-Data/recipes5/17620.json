After reading reviews made these changes: melted 6 tbsp of margarine, added 6 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce, Onion soup mix, and garlic powder. Then sprinkled the chops w/ pepper & marinated in the liquid for an hr, turning over once. I marinated the chops in the baking pan, so all I had to do was throw in some chunks of potatoes & carrots, mixing it around to make sure they were coated w/ the liquid. I only cooked 2 chops to have enough sauce for flavoring the veggies and also used bone-in chops. I baked for about 30-45 min, covered in foil, and uncovered for the last 10 min to brown under the broiler, turning over once halfway. My chops were EXCELLENT! Great flavor (not too sweat or salty), juicy, & nicely browned. The sauce was the best, and my boyfriend said they were better than his mom's (she's a great cook). Sauce made it great, it was a little thin, but great over white rice. Excellent recipe! Might try Beefy onion soup next time! Thanks Jodi!",

I followed the recipe exactly but after the time allotted the chops didn't appear to look done so I cooked them for an additional 20 minutes...with no improvement. Finally I took them out cut into one and found that they were indeed cooked through. They just didn't brown or glaze like normal looking chops. Therefore the chops were not only a small eyesore but they were dried out (due to my overcooking). Next time when it comes time to uncover the chops I flip them over and cook for the last 15 min so that they look brown and have that brown sugar glaze all over.",

I brought the sauce ingrediants to a boil in a small saucepan first but I added about 1 tbls. of honey to the mixture. I poured most of it over the chops baked it at 300 covered for 20 min. and then poured the rem. mixture over the chops and then baked it for an additional 10 min and took the cover off for the last 10. No complaints at my house my husband is a picky eater and thought these were great and NOT dry. I recommend cooking at a lower temperature it should make it tender. If you want to get them super tender try the temp at 250 for possibly a longer time. Great and simple recipe.",

When it was time to put it in the oven I sprinkled just a little pepper and nutmeg and put about a half tsp of butter and brown sugar on each chop and resprinkled with soy sauce.
