So...I scaled the recipe down to two servings and, using just strawberries and rhubarb, baked this in individual ramekins for 20 minutes.  I didn't have tapioca so I substituted flour, 1-1/2 times as much.  I didn't have raw sugar either, but ordinary white sugar worked just fine.  I really liked that this was not overly spiced - the hint of cinnamon was just enough.  A minor and subjective criticism because these are delicious and SO cute, but I found the topping a little skimpy - next time I'll make another half recipe of it.",

I thought that this didn't make enough of the dough topping so I doubled that recipe as well.

It smells amazing and I will attempt to post my result picture after it comes out. additional comment after pulling out of the oven Thickened up nicely didn't bubble over at all.

I'm glad I put it on top of the pizza stone which caught all the juices but I'm thinking either my pan wasn't the correct size or this just bubbles up and over a lot. Either way there's still a lot of filling to the doubled topping and I like my cobbler a bit more balanced between topping and filling. Delicious combo though and a great use of the rhubarb we got from hubs' parents. Thanks for the recipe!",

For those who can\u2019t get their hands on tapioca, I understand! I made my own version of this 25 years ago when I lived in Switzerland, where I had access to rhubarb and strawberries but no tapioca. I used potato starch instead, as I was accustomed to using it in my cheese fondue; it is finer than cornstarch, and does not cloud the clarity of fruit sauces or fruit pies.  Use the same amount as you would corn starch.  I have never used tapioca, but I have used rice but not in this dessert.  But back to the point; potato starch or arrow root, which is even finer than potato starch can also be used.  Arrow root is the more common thickener used in Chinese food sauces like sweet and sour sauce; it is wonderfully clear, but corn starch would cloud it up, and potato starch too, but to a lesser degree.  I appreciate this recipe as I don\u2019t have that cobbler recipe from 25 years ago. I\u2019ll never forget the flavor, though!",
