I used 2 freshly diced tomatoes and omitted the chiles because my kids don't like anything hot. I also added a cup of beef broth and went ahead and drained the cans of corn (I normally use frozen corn, but didn't have any) and olives so it wouldn't be too watery. I used about a cup of dry black beans (I try to avoid canned processed foods) and I slightly cooked the onion, 4 cloves of minced garlic, and bell pepper in the skillet when the meat was just about done browning. I served different toppings to put on top: shredded Mexican style cheese, sliced avocado, sour cream, fried corn tortilla strips, and cut up some limes. Nice little make-it-your-own taco soup bar.",
