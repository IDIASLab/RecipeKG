This is my first time making bread and may I just say how simple it is to make! I got so excited seeing it rise in the oven... And boy, when it came out of the oven and I tried a slice (after letting it cool, of course), the flavor is unparalleled. My family and friends loved it...and with a bit of butter and jam...too delicious!! All I can say is that I won't be buying Irish soda bread from Whole Foods anymore...I'll be making my own!!! Please hurry and make this bread now! Your family and friends (as well as your own taste buds) will thank you later!",

I love oats so added an extra 1/4 cup. I subtracted a 1/4 cup flour to keep the dry measures the same. I only used whole wheat flour not all-purpose for part. This created a lovely brown bread. I used fennel seeds in place of the orange zest and I highly recommend this. Finally I realized at the last moment that I didn't have parchment paper so I greased my cast iron skillet and made one large loaf. My husband and I already ate half with dinner!",

I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own as per Chef John's blog. But the work paid off because this is a great breakfast bread or perfect with afternoon tea/coffee.

However it is a delightful tasting bread...perfect for breakfast or brunch.  It tastes more like a moister scone!  I made it with all the listed ingredients except substituted steel cut oats for the rolled oats (steel cut oats are the secret ingredient for true Irish soda bread).  Can't say I really noticed them in this bread.  Also used 1/4 cup Craisens because that is what I had.  Baked the loaves for the time stated but did so in a metal roaster pan with parchment in the bottom.  Took off the lid to brown the last 10 minutes.  They were baked perfectly.  I bake my artisan bread in the roaster pan to keep them moist....works very well!",

                "reviewBody": "I made the recipe pretty much as written. I increased whole wheat flour to 1 cup and decreased all purpose to 2 3/4 cups. The dough was so wet and unmanageable. I had to dust frequently with flour just to get it off the kneading surface and my hands. So I probably added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. That is why it has a 3 star rating. On the upside I loved the flavor and especially the orange zest that sets it apart from other soda breads. The texture was a bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I might make this again...and maybe decreased the buttermilk.",
