The flavorful wild rice, kale, and veggie combination with a lemony dressing can be made year-round and earns raves whenever it's served. It also keeps wonderfully, so make it ahead with no hesitation.",

It made the whole salad purple which is pretty and very UW (go Huskies!) My fennel bulb was huge so I only used one. I think fennel is what made the salad so interesting and different - I make and eat kale salads all the time I love to make them on Sunday and take them to work for lunch all week. Thanks for another winner Scandogirl it was delicious and held up well all week. BTW My husband had to sprinkle his with cayenne which I admit was good too he used just a pinch so not hot just a little different flavor.",

Next time I am going to add some grape tomatoes and grated cheese. Really quick to fix and I will definitely be making it again! Thanks for submitting!",

Also if you want to prepare the salad ahead of time just add everything even the rice store in fridge and add the dressing about 10 mins before serving.",
