        "description": "Australians and New Zealanders both claim Pavlova and this recipe is so easy it feels like cheating!  I first had it when a friend brought it to our final dress rehearsal and begged her for the recipe! It is especially striking when the fruits and berries are in season.  Personally, I like to add coconut for the crunch, but it's NOT sweetened coconut &ndash; it's unsweetened, in big flakes, and I get it from the fruit and nut guy at our commissary. It's a real crowd pleaser and the best thing about it is you can make it a day ahead.  Just allow the meringue to fully cool and cover lightly with plastic wrap. Top with whipped cream and fruit just prior to serving.",

The reason that a pav is such a spectacular dessert is the contrast: sweet marshmallowy meringue mild cream tangy fruit. Sweeten the cream and it will be too sweet. 3) Try spooning on passionfruit pulp if you can find fresh passionfruit. Not only is it traditional but it s the perfect foil for the pav: tangy and crunchy. Passionfruit can be used alone or in addition to the other fruit.",
