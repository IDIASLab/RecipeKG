I used a spiral cut ham. Used about 1/2 the sauce and baked according to the hams direction. For the final 30 minutes of cooking I really coated the ham with the rest of the glaze and baked the remainder of the time uncovered. Like the suggestions I really got the sauce into the slices with a BBQ brush. IT IS AMAZING!",
