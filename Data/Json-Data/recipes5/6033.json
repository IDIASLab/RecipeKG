The panko topping was perfect.  At first I thought there wasn't enough butter to cover the 1/2 cup, but it turned out great.  We very much enjoyed our dinner!  Thanks, Lindsey!",

I also seasoned the fish with Fleur de Sel and Herbes de Provence prior to the layer of dijon mustard.  I skipped the broth bath and just baked the fish on tin foil on a sheet pan. My half halibut was more than 16 ounces so I baked it for about 40 mins before letting it broil for about 30 seconds. I think I will use more parsley in the panko/parm mixture and finish with the Fleur de Sel and Herbes de Province. Perhaps slather a tad more dijon. I too had made this dish with the Corn Maque Choux. My dinner guests were thoroughly sated after having seconds and thirds even! I don't know why I was so intimidated with seafood! One of the easiest dishes to make! I'll be doing this again! Thanks for this great keeper!",

I drizzled some olive oil and pressed the panko crumb mixture on top. I didn't bother with the stock on the bottom. Cooked 20 minutes and put under the broiler until golden brown. I served with creamy saffron sauce by Mark Bittman. It was great with and without the saffron sauce. Thanks for sharing.",

Serving this with Melody's Corn Maque Choux also from this site perked it up significantly.",

Instead I powdered some gluten free corn flakes in my vitamix blender and used it in the place of panko. With that out in the open, I totally enjoyed this recipe. Some bites were lemony, some bites were mustardy, some bites were crispy and yet other bites were more halibutty. The halibut was juicy and tender. I'm not sure why the recipe called for 1/4 cup of chicken broth in the pan. It only browned and got burned around the edges. I might leave that out next time and just oil the pan instead.",
