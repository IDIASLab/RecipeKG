I had the chicken sauteed, and the sauce simmering and it smelled awful,  I  was ready to add the chicken but decided to give the sauce a taste first, I'm sure glad I did, It was the worst.  I thought it was maybe just me so I called my husband over and made him try it.  After that it went straight down the drain and I made the chicken into a different recipie.  I love marmelade so that was not the problem.  It was the combination of all of the flavors, they just did not go together I thought.",
