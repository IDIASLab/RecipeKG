I had an avocado and cottage cheese that looked as though they'd get tossed if I didn't use them soon so I approached this as an experiment thinking I had nothing to lose if I found I didn't care for it. Since I made only a small amount it wasn't practical for me to open a can of green chiles so I substituted fresh minced jalapeno pepper instead. The garlic salt salt and pepper and lemon juice I added to taste always a good idea. I was absolutely floored at how delicious this was! One could be tempted to add ingredients like cilantro parsley fresh garlic or cumin and while they would all probably be nice additions they are by no means necessary - and frankly any changes might just spoil this lovely recipe. It's creamy smooth not too spicy with a hint of avocado flavor and just the slightest tang from the cream cheese and cottage cheese. Since I knew it was also good for me I ate it by the spoonful!",

After tasting the finished product I decided it needed more salsa (I got hot salsa like the first reviewer suggested) so I added an additional 1/4 cup. I even think it could use more but I realize that it will taste even better after the flavors have melded overnight so I'm not going to tinker with it anymore. BTW when they say \"plentiful\" in the name of this recipe they mean it. It makes a huge bowl. I love it and can't wait to taste it again tomorrow.",
