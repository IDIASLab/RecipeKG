I did add one tea bag to the pot as well as a cinnamon stick (instead of the ground cinnamon). I added the lemon with the other ingredients as well. It was fantastic! Update This is my go to fall drink. The tea bag totally changes the taste and I still only use the cinnamon stick instead of the ground cinnamon. I have also used 2T of sugar in place of the honey and it is so delicious.",
