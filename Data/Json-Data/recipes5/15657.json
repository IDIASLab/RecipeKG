All of the changes were minor and do not change the dip, except two: I cook the chicken and then mix it up with the cilantro and that I like to add tortilla chips sticking out around the edge of the dip and more on the side for serving. Hope that helps and you enjoy it!",

Only changes were a) omitting bacon (cholesterol & all) and b) I used left over chicken breasts which I diced and then marinated in a little chicken broth salsa and a bit of taco seasoning. Once I had layered the beans chicken and first bout of cheese I also ran under the broiler to melt the cheese and warm it up a bit. Then finished layers. Served with spanish rice chips and a lite salad.",
