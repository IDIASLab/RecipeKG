My husband also made yummy groaning sounds (he took the 1st bite) and then I of course added to the musical harmony of happy groans. I used Trader Joe's Swai Striped Pangasius (in a red and blue bag). It had a wonderful texture. I hate fishy fish and am a tough critic when it comes to fish but I would make this anytime...so easy too! Oh and I used Chardonnay for the wine. For the side I made TJ's Mulitgrain Blend (wild rice) with Vegetables (in bad-frozen section)- so easy so delish! THanks Kathy!",

I used barramundi so I believe this recipe would be wonderful with any firm white fish. (Barramundi is an excellent choice because it holds together well when turning.) One other thing I would recommend - only use a wine you would drink. A huge part of the flavor is derived from the wine you use.",
