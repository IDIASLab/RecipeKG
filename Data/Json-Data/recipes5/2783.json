I cut the recipe and half and used \"Taco Seasoning II\" from this site to season the chicken first vs. adding it to the salsa and left out the lemon juice and garlic. I used Ortega's Medium chunky style salsa (a bit more than called for) and love the addition of black beans and chopped red pepper. After everything was layered I topped it with a light Mexican blend cheese. I then baked it at 375 for 45 minutes. Baking this at 400 for an hour and a half would result in some really dried out chicken. After it came out of the oven I dressed it up a bit by topping it off with some sliced black olives and thin sliced green onions.The chicken is tender, juicy and oh so good! It's perfect topped off with dollup of light sour cream and a side of Spanish rice - YUM!",

I suggest 45 minutes for more servings. If you you bake too long, I'm afraid the beans will burn. I topped with some chopped green onions and served it with sour cream and over rice. This was a really good recipe. The chicken was nice and moist, and it's really a nice low-calorie recipe. I will for sure make again. Thanks.",

For chicken tenderness, 5. Easy of prep, 5. Directions, ?-not sure an hour and a half is necessary at 400. Has any one tried it this way? I did 350 for about 45 minutes. The flavor was just lacking. I think those who have dressed this up with sour cream, cheese, fresh tomatoes, a tortilla, corn chips, etc. are on the right track. I served over rice as suggested by recipe. I accidentally got some canned Mexi-corn on my fork with a mouthful, and went, \"That's what this needs! Something to lighten it up!\" It is just so heavy and dark. So...if you add these lighter, cooler items, it is a good recipe. But not spectacular.",

However a 400 degree oven caused the black beans to become a bit crunchy after an hour. Next time I prepare this I will bake at 350 degrees & add the black beans in with the salsa mixture. I topped this dish with shredded muenster cheese & baked just until melted for the last few minutes. Delicious even with the slight crunch.",
