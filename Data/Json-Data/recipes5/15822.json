This is an appetizer that eats like a MEAL and it keeps guests coming back to the bowl. You may have to work out twice to make up for it, but you'll be happy you did!

I substituted the pound of pork breakfast sausage for a real man meat sausage none of that breakfast fluff and it just melts into the cheese. Aunty suggested bloods pudding for her tea but I know she hasn t been feeling well and this melted-man-dip did just the trick to take away her peckishness. She likes her dip spicy so I made sure to cook my sauce for a good 25 minutes. Sarah is still on her green platform though. she won t eat anything but pork. I may try using this dip as a sauce in my pasties.",
