Now adding the celery it was tolerable to okay. My kids liked it with the multigrain pita chips I served it with. Tamari sauce was a quest to find. I did find it in my speciality section at the commissary on post. And boy I wished i had googled what it was before hand. It's rather cheap but it's a deeper darker soy sauce with traces of wheat. It smells the same but when mixed it had a tad bit of a back heat to it. Not much ver slight and suttle. I will say this is a recipe you either like it or totally dislike it. We are in the middle. I'm sorry to say. But celery is a must in this recipe. And I'm not sure if i'd make again. I apologize.",
