I try to eat gluten- and sugar-free food as much as possible while keeping it delicious and full of flavor. This simple recipe is an easy choice! Agave nectar is a fantastic natural sweetener that is low carb and low glycemic index. It is about twice as sweet as sugar so use it in moderation. Use twice the amount of sugar if you are going to substitute. I like my apples tart, so feel free to sweeten to taste.",

I needed to use them because the kids didn't eat them up quick enough! I wanted a recipe that would allow me to sweeten up the applesauce some but without sugar. This turned out very good exceeding my expectations!",
