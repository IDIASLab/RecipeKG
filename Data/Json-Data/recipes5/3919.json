                "reviewBody": "Amazingly addictive!!  N1COLE nailed it!!  But I wanted to add some grilling tips for people who have never tried this before.  When you look at an oyster shell, you will see that one side is more of a bowl shape and the other side is flatter.  Cook them with the bowl shape down to keep in more moisture and avoid shoe leather.  Oysters  will sometimes \"explode\" and rapidly vent steam when they first pop open on the grill so be careful where you put your fingers and face when you first start cooking them.  They will not \"open up\" like clams do either.  You should see a space just large enough to easily slide a knife into and that's usually about it.  Maybe only 1/4\" or so.  They cook very quickly once they open, so keep watch and take them off fast - listen for the sizzle.  Use a heavy glove or thick towel to protect you from the heat, sharp shells, and bubbling liquid when taking off the top shell.  If you are brand new to grilling these, do them one at a time until you figure out the timing to suit your taste buds (rare, medium, well done, etc) before loading up the grill and potentially ruining a whole batch.  Then be prepared to feed your new addiction because these are amazing!!",
