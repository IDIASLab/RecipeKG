We've never had a cornmeal type coating on our fish before (we\u2019re used to doing beer batter or breadcrumbs), but there was a perfect balance of flavors in this recipe and the coating adhered perfectly to our fish. Nice and crispy whereas if I baked these in the oven they probably would not be crisp at all. I used rockfish and lingcod fillets and my cook time was a little longer (16 min total)). Served with a chipotle seasoned tartar sauce I made and tater tots. Delish! Thanks for the recipe, Kim!",
