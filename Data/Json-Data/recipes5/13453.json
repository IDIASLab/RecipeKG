A problem I found is that once the cold shrimp hits the melted butter/oil mixture, it starts solidifying and clumping up, so it's a little difficult to toss together. I ended up spreading what had solidified over top the shrimp once in the dish. I used extra large shrimp instead of medium, and mine were done at 12 minutes, so definitely start checking before the stated 15-18 minutes. You don't want to overcook shrimp. I used Italian seasoned panko because that's what I had on hand - it added even more flavor. I also found I needed less panko than stated. I used just over 1/4 cup and that was plenty.  I loved the crunch of the panko with the buttery shrimp!",

First, I always use colossal shrimp in every shrimp recipe. I also remove the tails before cooking. It doesn\u2019t make sense to have to pick up shrimp out of butter to pull off the greasy tails. Second, I read that the melted butter was getting cold when added to the other ingredients that are cold. So I tossed the Parmesan cheese and garlic with the olive oil only and drizzled the melted butter over the shrimp before topping it with the Panko bread crumbs. Before serving,  I squeezed fresh lemon over the dish. It was great!",

The only problem  I did have was the parmesan cheese was falling off but I attribute that to using shredded parmesan instead of grated. I would for sure make this again.\nThank you.",
