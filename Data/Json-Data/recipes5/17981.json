The aroma in my house was incredible-my husband said he was hit by a 'wave of apple heaven' when he walked in from work.  The only complaint we have is the cost of the apple brandy.  To make 21 jars we spent $40 on brandy- it's great apple butter, but maybe I'll use 1/2 and 1/2 cider and brandy next time to cut our cost.  I also changed the spice amounts- I reduced the ginger to 3/4 tsp., upped the amount of cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp., kept the cloves the same, and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and two pinches of cardamom per recipe.  Lastly, I chopped my apples coarsely, and think next time I'll chop them finer-or when the recipe says 'cooked until easily mashed' I'll mash them-the recipe wasn't specific about that.  Thankfully, I had my boat motor (hand blender), and I just pureed it when it was all done cooking.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!",
