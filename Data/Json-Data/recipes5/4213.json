The sauce is not supposed to be thick, but if you like it that way you can add a little cornstarch mixed with cold water, or make a roux (flour and butter).  Also I use thin chicken breast cutlets not tenderloins (the allrecipes staff changed my recipe to tenderloins).  Thanks for all the nice compliments - I am glad most of you liked this!",

I used a small jar of artichokes in oil and drained it.  Added a large hand full of capers (always rinse under water and pat dry in a towel as they tend to be salty) and let the artichokes & capers blend with the broth until all was reduced to 1/2; returned the chicken to the sauce let that combine for 10 minutes or so and it was great.  Nice recipe - a keeper for sure.  One to impress guests",
