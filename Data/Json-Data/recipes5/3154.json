The apple cooked so much that it became mushy so next time I will add it to the onions when I cook them. My family thought it needed more sausage so next time I think I'll add another lb. The recipe sure did taste great and was perfectly complimented by mashed potatoes and rye bread. Thanks for the recipe!",

I took the great advice of others and made just a couple of minor adjustments. I had a fairly large head of cabbage so I doubled the recipe. But I too reduced salt. I added about 1 tsp. of caraway seed (really \"makes\" it)! Also I used a large green apple unpeeled and diced. I would use more apple next time. I added the apple when I put the cooked onions into the pot of cabbage. I used homemade broth instead of water which added more flavor and since I doubled it there was lots of good juice to pour over our baked potatoes. Oh and I used more vinegar. Delish!",

Sauteed the linguica in butter and then sauteed the onion in those pan drippings. Replaced lemon with fresh lime juice. Used balsamic wine vinegar distilled vinegar in place of white wine vinegar (we were out). Also added more vinegar (added to taste) and reduced the amount of salt.",

The sausage once sliced fried and added to the 'kettle' (pan with lid) tated devine. But sadly the apple didn't hold it shape as planned but then I don't think was a bad thing at all as it gave a sweetness to counteract the sour lemon throughout the dish. I also used cider vinegar as that what we had. Let's just say that when our veg box gave us another red cabbage this week I've gone out and bought some sausage to make this again. Yum!",
