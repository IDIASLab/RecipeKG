I've made it several more times since. based on the suggestion from TribecaChef who submitted the recipe I've sub'd canned green chilis for jalapenos. I've also combined the jalapenos & green chilis together. once I garnished it with a healthy dose of cayenne instead of paprika (about 4 pinches instead of 2). This can be made as hot or mild as you want without taking away from the flavor & texture of TribecaChef's original recipe. I shop at a local family owned grocery store that has an artisan bakery. They make a jalapeno sourdough bread that is fantastic! This dip & this bread are perfect together. -- I almost forgot I did \"tweak\" it. I don't add the salt because I think the cheese & mayo gives the perfect amount of saltiness but that's just my personal preference - the additional salt may be perfect for many others.",
