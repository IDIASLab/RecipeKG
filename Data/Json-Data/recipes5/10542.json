It came out perfectly and beautifully. After you have assembled it all and just before putting it in the oven it may seem as if there is too much liquid in the pan. Don't worry. It cooks off. I used six lasagna noodles per layer and that seemed to be plenty. After taking our portions I let the tray sit overnight covered with foil in the fridge. Then I cut the lasagna in equal portions wrapped them in plastic wrap and put them (bagged) in the freezer. It's a lot of work up front but well worth it; and now we have ten easy-to-heat meals left. (Oh I did add a little red wine to the sauce.)",

Regarding the sausage, anyone that has a Wholefoods close by....I highly recommend using the store  made mild chicken Italian sausage.   It so unbelievablely tastey!\n\nAlso, next time I will make extra sauce so that I can pour some on the individual slices.  Just a preference. \n\nGreat recipe, thank you Chef John!",
