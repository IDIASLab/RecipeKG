I divided it in half and I only had enough to put a very skimpy amount under the bacon. Using 3 Fuji apples and about 3/4 lb of bacon I followed directions exactly. I felt the oven temperature was a bit low to brown the bacon adequately without over cooking the meat. This had a good flavor the meat was very tender and the apples nearly stole the show.
