I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings and increased the vanilla extract to 1/4 tsp instead of 1/8. I used dark rum because I didn't have any whiskey in the house. Then I whipped up the ingredients in the food processor and there was no need to refrigerate the dough. After following the rest of the directions in the recipe I baked the cookies to perfection in a waffle cone griddle. They tasted very similar to the authentic Belgium Buttery Waffle Cookies that my co-worker brought back to the office from her trip abroad. This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will be making them regularly.",
