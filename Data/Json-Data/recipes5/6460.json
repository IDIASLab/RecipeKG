It's a bit of sodium overload however, with bacon and potato chips, but then you just have to eat carrot sticks and an apple the next day and hope that there's no leftover hot chicken salad in the fridge.",

I used a small rotisserie chicken (just the easy to get off bits:) ) regular onion since I didn't have green onion and crushed Goldfish crackers since I didn't have potato chips and it turned out fine. One can add mushrooms or water chestnuts like other recipes but this is enough for comfort creaminess & the nutty-crunch that makes hot chicken salad so wonderful. Thanks for a good recipe!",
