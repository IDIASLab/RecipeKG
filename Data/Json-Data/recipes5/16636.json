(Although when still very warm out of oven they are a little chewy.)  2 cups of toffee bits seemed really high for the amount of cookie batter it made, so I decreased to only 1 cup - and it was PLENTY! Every bite had toffee & pecan pieces.  I also upped the pecans to 1/2 cup.  Make sure you press down on the cookie dough after you put on cookie sheet, or you end up with tall round cookies...I flattened a little bit with my fingers and the rest came out perfectly shaped. Very good recipe!",

But I wasn't all that moved...because they're very buttery and on the flatter side! (And I did chill the dough) I thought the amount of salt unnecessarily high so I reduced it by half. I also thought the amount of toffee chips was a little much so I subbed half of it with milk chocolate chips and loved that switch. I took the extra step of toasting the pecans which nearly always makes for a better tasting cookie in my book. Great flavor with all that's going on in this cookie crisp on the edges soft but chewy on the inside. But because they're kind of thin they're not the prettiest cookie either but again that may just be a matter of opinion.",
