These are really good. I used more than a couple drops of hot sauce (more like a few dashes) and was afraid it was going to be too much. Nope just right. Perfect balance between sweet and salty with a little bit of heat. Also I let them cook closer to an hour and moved them around on the pan every 15 minute or so. Made just about 2 cups (2 pumpkins worth) last night and between my bf and I I'll bet they'll be gone by tonight. Now if I can just come up with a reson to buy more pumpkins....",

I rinsed and put them on a paper-towel lined baking sheet overnight. Also my husband just tried these and he says that there was no possible way I could have made these any better. He says he'll be growing more pie-pumpkins for me next year just so he can get the seeds! These are that good! Oh wow I've been making different varieties of roasted pumpkin seeds for years and after just taking these out of the oven and being unable to stop eating them this recipe is going straight into my autumn recipe file!! I couldn't believe how good these were! The only changes I made weren't that significant--I used Smart Balance Light instead of butter to cut the calories a little used a tad extra brown sugar and replaced the hot sauce with a good dash of cayenne pepper (didn't have a spicy enough hot sauce that I liked on-hand). I also baked these for only 35 minutes stirring every 10 minutes or so to make sure they didn't stick to the cookie-sheet and burn. I can't wait to serve these at our annual pumpkin-carving party--I know they're be a hit. Thanks for the yummy and super-easy recipe!!",
