I used Garam Masala spice mixture (Cardamom Black pepper Coriander Nugmeg Cloves and Cinnamon)to give it some more flavor. Only for okra lovers. Don't make it if you don't like okra. Okra has a viscous texture when cooked and aids in thickening soups and stews.",

I used lamb neck the least expensive cut. I cut the pieces of lamb meat into small bites....about 1/4- 1/3\" cubes. This was much less than 2 lbs lamb meat but there was a bit of lamb in each bite of stew giving definite lamb flavor. I put the bones in with the stew. I used MUCH less garlic(2 large cloves).I omitted mint and fresh rosemary...I am not fond of either and did not have them. I used marjoram dried instead of rosemary. I did not have tomato paste. The cans of tomatoes I had were: one plain diced and one diced with green peppers slightly spicy. After draining I put the juices back in because the mixture was too dry to simmer. I did not make the pilaf. I enjoyed the result and will definitely make it again.",
