The reason I didn't give it five stars apart from my status as a grumpy old man is that the recipe doesn't say what shape of spinach pasta should be used. I used linguine and it was clunky looking and harder to eat than had I used penne or mezzo penne. Also what kind of ricotta should be used? Regular ricotta is nice and creamy but it makes the salad look like a train wreck! Maybe ricotta salata would be a better choice? You give up creaminess but may have a nicer looking salad. This was a very tasty dish and it will be made again and again in our house. Other changes I would make are the addition of artichoke hearts a bit of red onion and maybe a garnish of sliced green onion.",
