I made a couple of changes only because I didn't have the ingredients listed but, OMG, it was fabulous too.  This is what I did >>>  I used store bakery bread, I cut into cubes, and while the oven was preheating placed the cubes on a baking sheet in the oven to dry for a few minutes.  I used fresh Parmesan (shredded) in place of the Romano.  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes so I substitued a can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano.  (I diced the tomatoes even finer, using approximately the quantity of a fresh tomato.)  The fish I had on hand was Cod.  Will make this often.  Great recipe to make for company if you know they like fish.  Thanks JellyKO for posting this most delicious, simple, and eye pleasing recipe.",

I steam the veggies in a little water and don't add any butter and it tastes amazing and full of flavour. Shrimp also tastes great in place of crab meat and is a nice variation. I usually use low-fat parmesan, because that's what I have on hand and it works well. I really like the sweetness of bell peppers in seafood dishes, so I replace the tomato with minced bell pepper (using the same cooking process). This is one of my favorite dishes and is sooo much healthier without the oil and butter!",

My only hint to cooks is to have your bread finely cubed (diced?) - or even use one of those unseasoned stuffing mixes instead of the bread.  The consistency of the stuffing I made was a bit too chunky for the flakey haddock. I might also add in some parmesan next time - but was WONDERFUL even without.",
