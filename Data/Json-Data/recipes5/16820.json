However, I make mine with 1 tsp of cornstarch instead of flour and omit the cinnamon and nutmeg from the pie and put it in the topping.  We really prefer a crumb top on this pie.  It really compliments the apple/cranberry filling.  Here is my recipe for a crumb top:\n1 c all purpose flour, 1/2 c packed brown sugar, 1/3 c old-fashioned oats, 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 c chilled unsalted butter cut into small pieces.\nRub in butter with fingertips or process w/food processor until mixture resembles coarse meal.\n\n",

Just fyi I used all six apples 2 granny smith and 4 golden delicious but next time I'm tempted to up the number of granny smiths. The pie wasn't nearly as tart as I thought it might be.
