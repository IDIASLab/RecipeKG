Because unless you were eating in a restaurant that specialized in chummus, you were eating industrialized chummus--which is kind of like eating spaghetti at Sabarro (sp?) and saying that you know authentic Italian cuisine.\n\nChummus is an art here and you've got to know where to go to find the good stuff. I'm not saying this recipe parallels Abu Chasan or Bahadonas, but for homemade chummus, it's pretty good.",

Since then I have not found a recipe or store brand that I thought was close to authentic. This is fabulous. It is so creamy and mild and my husband is glad that I don't smell like garlic! The cumin gives it a good flavor and I added just a dash of cayenne to give a little kick. Cooking the dry beans instead of using canned also makes this a much fresher tasting dish. Thanks.

Home cooked beans are far superior to canned and much more economical. Homemade hummus (or just about anything homemade for that matter) is superior to any pre-made full of preservative thing you buy at the store. To those of you who have commented that the texture is coarse either your beans are not cooked enough and/or you have not blended the hummus long enough at 5 minutes in my high powered blender it is smooth silky and fluffy. Blend puree or process until you have the correct texture! Cumin is an authentic Near and Middle Eastern seasoning garlic if used it is just a whisper. Remember this is not an American grocery store clone. This is the real stuff probably a recipe passed from an elder relative to a younger one including the most special ingredient of all love! So if you must add the whole bulb of garlic roasted red pepper or a hot pepper or two more or less tahini and lemon juice or whatever else you want to make it with love and then it will be authentic to you and your family. Oh I almost forgot my favorite way to eat it is warm on freshly baked homemade pita bread or soft lavosh some nice salty cured olives on the side! Yum!!!!!!",
