                "reviewBody": "I liked the look of this as a different salad and decided to try it despite it not being reviewed yet. I used Lebanese couscous made with chicken broth, because that\u2019s what I had. 1 cup of uncooked couscous makes a lot. A LOT. I used maybe 5oz of figs. I ended up using way more balsamic vinegar (doubled), and a fair amount of salt and pepper.  It needed an extra something so I added a generous splash or two of lemon juice. Even with all the extra liquids, it was really thick and there was no way I could pour it like the recipe said. The biggest change was that I gradually added the couscous to the pan instead of the other way around, so I could gauge the fig mixture to couscous ratio. I\u2019m really glad I did it this way because it would have made so much and would have been way too much couscous. I ended up adding only about 1/2. I prepared this the day before and I think the couscous absorbed the flavours overnight. The original recipe says to divide this among 4 plates, which would\u2019ve been a huge serving of the fig mixture and no longer really a salad. I made 8 small spinach plates as an appetizer, and topped it with 2 generous TBSPs of the fig mix. I only had feta and pecans. I put a slice of feta on top and added toasted pecans. The cheese and the nuts complimented the tangy sweet of the balsamic, it was good. You could very easily cut this recipe in half and still have leftovers. Everyone liked it and I\u2019ll make it again.",
