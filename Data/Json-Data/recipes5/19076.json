It's not as good as fresh lemongrass, but at least you will get some of the flavor. Also, I've discovered that adding basmati rice that is a little toasted or crispy adds another really great element to this soup. One more thing, my recipe calls for minced lemongrass because we like the texture and crunch of it. However, some people might not, so you can just put the whole stalks in a take them out when ready to eat. Thanks for all the great reviews!\n\nEDIT: My recipe calls for 2 teaspoons of curry paste because I used incredibly spicy paste. Lately I am not able to find that particular brand and most red curry pastes on the market are not very spicy. So add to taste and according to how spicy the paste is that you have.",

Next time I would only use one and would also add waaay more lime juice (to give it that sweet and sour Thai flavour), more lemongrass, and possibly some lime leaves and fresh Thai chilies. I also added two heads of bok choy to make it more of a meal, which turned out well.\n\nUPDATE: I have a new way of making this soup that has put it in regular rotation. Skip the oil, slice the ginger and lemongrass and throw all ingredients in the left column, plus 4 cups water in a large pot. Let simmer for a bit while you prep the rest, then scoop out the ginger and lemongrass with a slotted spoon. Add regular mushrooms (not shiitakes) and 1 can of coconut milk. After mushrooms have softened a bit add a package of vermicelli rice noodles. When the noodles are done, throw in a small package of whole snap peas, prawns, and lime juice and turn off the heat. Let it sit for a couple of minutes until the prawns are cooked and the peas are bright green. Top with cilantro and serve.",

We had never had shrimp in it before, but what a great addition! I did not use Shitake mushrooms because I had white mushrooms, but it would be fabulous. Can't add too much ginger so don't worry about the amount listed in the recipe. I grated it using a microplane. My other additions were galanga and dried red thai chilies 'cause HE likes it hot. I used about a tsp of the tube lemongrass (cause fresh is sometimes hard to find here in the\"sticks\".) I made the entire recipe and we ate most of it in one sitting.
