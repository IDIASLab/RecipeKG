I salvaged the fruit and nuts  by 'squishing' the bricks in warm water and used them in YOUR recipe.   HEAVEN!!!  They were WONDERFUL!!  I can't thank you enough.. I even substituted burgandy for whiskey in the second batch because I ran out, and they were still great.  Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!",

I used green candied cherries and candied pineapple and soaked them in whiskey along with the raisins for about an hour. I also toasted the pecans before baking.

I had some brandy Seagrams 7 and Crown Royal (but not enough of any of them to use without mixing). I sniffed everything I had left and settled on Southern Comfort. I soaked the raisins as directed and proceeded with making the cookies. I cannot believe I like them better. Since I am taking them to a wake I am calling them \"Comfort Cookies\".",
