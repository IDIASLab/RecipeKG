I know everyone hates reviews from someone who changes the recipe but there were some ingredients i didn't have but I wanted a one pot shrimp recipe. I didn't have olives but i did have fennel so I shaves about 1/3 cup of fennel after the carrots and onions. I skinned the tomato and used vermouth and chicken bone broth that I made. I looked up the components of sazon seasonings and used those spices. The shrimp got an extra dose of Adobo as it was a little flat tasting. As I said, the recipe that was written was a good beginning.",
