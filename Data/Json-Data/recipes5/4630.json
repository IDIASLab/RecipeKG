I SO appreciated that this wasn't bogged down with heavy seasonings! Just before serving, I topped the salad with some freshly shaved Parmegiano-Reggiano and it was a nice addition. Now this is the \"Mediterranean Style\" way of eating exemplified. Good and good FOR you!   ",

I did this recipe using 3 kinds of tomatoes from my garden - red cherry, yellow pear, and green zebra -- and served it at room temperature.  Usually I add herbs to recipes, but the simplicity of this one let the distinct flavors of the tomatoes emerge, and the effect was wonderful (not to mention healthy).  If you use good, fresh tomatoes and avoid the fridge, you won't have to spike it with lime, cilantro, etc. to give it flavor.",

It's a great recipe where anything goes - and with fresh ingredients it's nice to have a simple citrus-y flavor! I might try lime juice & cilantro next time as one reviewer suggested.",
