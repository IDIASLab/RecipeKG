Rice I\u2019ve ever made and I agree\u2026full of more flavor than I expected using the Instant Pot (IP)! I\u2019ve subbed taco seasoning when out of cumin and have made this exactly as written too. Here are some tips for some who might be new to the IP as I was. #1 Rinse your rice. #2 Do not stir in the tomato sauce\u2014recipe doesn\u2019t say to do so, but you might be tempted out of habit. When I stirred, IP did not come to pressure and some rice was uncooked. I fired up pot for 3 additional minutes, but ended up with a very thin burned layer of rice on bottom of pot. No big deal, just remove the pot and cover it with foil. Cooked rice will lift off fine and some like the crisp part anyway. Barely any rice wasted from my own newbie error. You\u2019ll just have to soak the pot a little to wash out what\u2019s left\u2026easy peasy. #3 Do not try to do natural release because you\u2019re busy with other dishes. Texture change noted\u2026still good though. #4 Chunky/Thick salsas do not seem to work as a sub. #5 If rice done and you think too much moisture, just leave it on keep warm and excess moisture will be absorbed by rice or evaporate lending to perfect fluffy and delicious Mexican Rice. End of story, make exactly as recipe instructs and you won\u2019t be disappointed! Yum! Thanks again, Bren\u2014I\u2019ve been converted to making your rice in the IP! :)",

The \"Burn\" warning seems to be prevalent to the newer models and there are several possible causes. 1. The pot is too hot from sauteing,  should this happen in the future simply turn off the unit and wait a few minutes  2. The gasket in improperly inserted 3. There are bits stuck to the bottom of the pot 3. The pressure relief valve is stuck and releasing steam....I am sorry that this recipe didn't work for you, best of luck with future recipes:)\nI am responding to a question about the pressure on this recipe, there is an error in the instructions that I didn't catch...it should be high pressure, not low.

Instead, I replaced the 1 1/2 Cups of chicken broth with 2 Teaspoons of \"Better Than Bouillon\" dissolved into 1 1/2 Cups warm water. Also added 1 whole diced Serrano pepper. This is my go to Mexican rice recipe from here on out. The ingredient proportions and cook time were spot on, and I did NOT experience any burn issues whatsoever. To clarify one thing, I waited exactly 5 minutes AFTER engaging the  pressure release mechanism before opening the lid...flawless rice. Seriously. Release the pressure immediately after the 7 minute cook time, and then wait the 5 minutes.",

I mixed in the tomato sauce when I was making it.  According to an IP troubleshooting blog I read, and another reviewer noted not to mix the sauce, don't mix the sauce because the liquid at the bottom needs to be thin.  What that means is that after you have mixed everything, pour the tomato sauce on top and don't mix it in, just let it float there, so the liquid on the bottom stays thin.  Next, I am unclear whether I cook on high pressure or low pressure?  I don't know.  I think the flavors are great, but the instructions are unclear for those of us who are not used to using an IP.
