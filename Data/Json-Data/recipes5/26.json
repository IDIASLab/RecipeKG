Cooked the sausage, onion & pepper on the stove, added other ingredients then stuffed the squash.  Reduced oven to 400 and baked another 30 - 35 minutes.  The marinara and vegetables with the squash created a unique but pleasing flavor. I didn't care for the sausage but it may have been the brand. It was a nice change of pace dinner. Thank you",

The meat mixture is great but after you stuff the 2 halves of squash it is impossible to fit them both in the pot without 1 tipping. I had to pressure cook them one at a time. Then realized 4 min plus 7 min release was still not enough to cook the squash it was still hard so it took forever. Next time I will cook the 2 halves of squash alone in the pot which I know only takes 6 minutes. Cook the meat mixture on the stove and this meal could have been done in 15 min.",

I don't have a pressure cooker so I put a little water in the bottom of an oven proof skillet and baked it at 375 for about 30 minutes. One thing I really like about this recipe is that it's meaty and hearty. All too often you find recipes for acorn squash that are sweet. This one is filling and I only ate 1/4 of it. Also I think you could make many variations according to your own taste.",
