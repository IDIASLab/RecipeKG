It was very sweet. Everyone liked it especially the kids (6). Just make sure that you use a pan big enough on the bottom to put all the dumplings in at one time to cook. That way you will not have to reheat (bring to boil) the sauce a second time like I had to.",

Corrections to consider- a well-seasoned cast iron skillet is a must (no exceptions) use white granulated sugar and brown it in the skillet (this takes practice and good timing) and try it with some butter-salted pan seared pecans on top. The crunch is nice and the salt with the sweet is nice.",

Since most of the original sauce was absorbed by the dumplings I made a little extra sauce to top individual servings. Serve while still warm. Toasted and or sugared pecans would be wonderful with these. If you like pancakes you'll like these. Fun recipe!",
