I left it in 12 minutes and then 5 minutes more. It should have been in 5 minutes more because when I went to spread the peanut butter it tore up the cookie. But maybe that way my fault it wasn't spreadable because I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy and nuts although I did use the whole jar. Then the chocolate did not melt and I left the oven on while doing this since my pastry level fell apart. Next time I will melt chocolate seperately then spread on top.",
