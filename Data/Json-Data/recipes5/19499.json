I prefer it marinated all day with the rootbeer and a tablespoon of worchestershire, heavily salted/peppered prior to grilling.  2 teaspoons chipotle sauce and I also use Campbells 2x strength beef broth to start for this.  The reduction down to 3/4 cup is approximate (I tend not to measure things-rather go by taste), it should be pretty potent and salty sweet.  Remember, you have to taste everything and make sure to adjust seasoning to your families tastes.",

EDIT- I thought I should add I let the chops marinate for 6 hours because that is the amount of time I had.  Defintely will do it for longer next time.  Also, I used a charcoal grill, which lends a nice flavor in my opinion.  In addition, my pepper mill is filled with a combo of black, white and red pepper corns, which is a wonderful combo that adds another flavor dynamic.  Finally, I used habanero hot sauce (Big Ben's BBQ brand- which I highly recommend), instead of chipotle flavored.  Very tasty.  A tip of my hat to you Ken!",

So....what I did was combine all the ingredients (with a couple tablespoons of cornstarch wisked in), braised my pork chops and stuck everything in the crockpot. Only change I made was adding in some sliced onions and minced garlic that I sauteed in the pan that I braised the pork chops in. I didn't need the extra salt as my beef broth and the worchestershire was salty enough on it's own. This made for some very tasty and moist pork chops but it needs a little something else. I can't put my finger on it. Maybe a tablespoon of dijon? A bay leaf? I liked the combination of the root beer and beef broth, it was sweet and beefy all at the same time.....it's just missing just a little somethin'-somethin'. This went really well with mashed potatoes. NOTE: I also used Campbell's beef broth only because it's double strength and has a stronger flavor than your usual boxed broth. I used a quality root beer, too. I think that makes all the difference.",

First of all as written while still producing a tender finished dish I give it a 4 for the fact that even beyond \"personal taste\" I think this would be a bit bland but with SO much potential. That said it turns into an easy 5 star with Ken's changes which he states in his review. So I added more chipotle hot sauce a fair bit of black pepper more Worcestershire sauce and I did marinate the chops in all of those ingredients not just the root beer. Followed the rest of the recipe as stated. We used Barq's root beer because we much prefer the \"bite\" to it as opposed to a sweeter one. I would do it all the same next time other than omitting the brown sugar but again that's only a personal taste in not liking things as sweet as some do. That does NOT lower my rating.:) Thank you Ken for the addition and the clarifying review.:)",

I followed the recipe exactly - marinating in the root beer and then using fresh root beer to combine with the other ingredients and reducing the liquid down to 3/4 cup and using it as a 'glaze' while grilling.  The end result was -- ok.  The chops were a little on the sweet side - but that's really all there was.  It seemed like a lot of effort for only an 'ok' end result.  For us, they were average - not bad - but not particularly special. **8/23/2010 update - I used the leftovers from this in the Pork Salad Croissant recipe from this site.  The leftovers worked GREAT in this salad.  The sweetness of the root beer was a nice complement to the spice of the chutney in the recipe and worked well with the apple and grape.",
