I also ran out of sesame oil so substituted peanut oil instead, shelled the edamame from the frozen steamer packs from Costco, used crunchy peanut butter in the sauce, and dry roasted peanuts instead if blanched on top after it was warmed up (gotta use what ya got!) I portioned it out into 6 whole bowls and kept in fridge for up to 4 days.  Took this for lunch and it was so so so good.  Healthy, filling, flavourful and packed with protein.",

Instead of the chile sauce I used approximately 3 tablespoons of Sriracha Sauce, 4 cloves of minced garlic, 3 tablespoons of fresh ginger, red pepper flakes (to taste) and just about a 1/2 fresh squeezed lime. As for the veggies you can use whatever you have in your fridge. Before serving  squeeze the remaining lime, stir and add 3 chopped scallions. I also did not use the cilantro and peanuts because I did not have any; and used smooth peanut butter because that is what I had on hand.",
