Our friends that we had over were impressed and my husband loved it. It was a bit spicy for me but I think that using mild italian sausage would help out with that area. My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is that this says 6 servings but we had 4 adults eating it and still had half of it left over afterwards! But the leftovers taste just as good.

I also found I had enough broth in the meat and vegetable mixture to prepare the couscous. I simply threw in the 2 cups of couscous directly into the pot after it was done cooking waited 5 minutes and gave it a stir (I used medium sized couscous). We also found it wasn't as spicy as we would have liked so we simply mixed a teaspoon or so of harissa with some chicken broth and poured it over the meal. It was fabulous.
