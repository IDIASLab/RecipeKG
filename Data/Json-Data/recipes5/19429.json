You can fry the chicken wings, but I prefer baking for less fat. This recipe is equally good with thighs, breasts, or skinless boneless chicken. You'd just have to adjust the cooking time. Serve with fried rice and stir fried veggies. Enjoy!",

I roasted the tenderloin for 20 minutes, then added some sauce, and cooked for 15 minutes longer. I say 'some' sauce because this recipe made a lot of it. Like a whole medium pot full - be aware of that if you are scaling down the meat portion, or using it for something different. Really tasty, sweet, garlic-y goodness. Very glad I made it. It's next incarnation will be in a stir fry. Thanks!",

They tasted like BWW's Carribean Jerk wings. When adding the cornstarch I did not add an additional 3/4 cup of water. I thought it would be too runny so I just reserved it from the 2 1/2 cups.",

I made one set with no soya sauce and it was great as well just a nice sweet honey garlic vs. tangy honey garlic with the soya sauce. Neither time did I mix the extra 3/4 cup of water in with the cornstarch; I just used some of the hot sauce as I felt there was enough water in this recipe and I wanted to max the flavour. Also pouring the sauce over the wings wastes a lot of sauce. I dunk the wings in the sauce and then bake 10 minutes redunk again with the rest of the sauce and finish baking. Then the wings are nice and saucy and the least amount of sauce is wasted on the pan. I put a layer of tinfoil down and spray it with Pam. Then they don't stick to the pan much if at all. Definitely a keeper recipe!!!",
