We ate this for two days on the trip and we were sad when it was gone. I made it into sandwiches and served it on raisin bread and we enjoyed it as a dip too. This is a keeper for sure!",

We used light Miracle Whip and fat free plain yogurt, two cubed chicken breasts from a left over rotisserie chicken and ripe red pear (since we did not have any grapes) and we did not have any nuts so we left them out. I can see this being very good in a whole wheat pita instead of regular sandwich bread like we did tonight. Will be using this one again.",
