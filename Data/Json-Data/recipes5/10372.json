Like the grains of Arborio rice, pieces of broken pasta are tossed in hot butter or oil before the liquid is added, but here we're going even further, and toasting it to a gorgeous nut-brown. This gives the dish its signature look, as well as adds a subtle nutty flavor.",

Great flavor and method...I used 'Barilla Cut Spaghetti', instead of breaking my own, just b/c I had it. I will be making this over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I was WRONG!! I only had linguine so I broke those up and other than that I didn't change a thing. This was SO very good. I didn't even had to add salt!!! I just kept adding a little broth at a time until it cooked down to the way I liked it. I sprinkled the red pepper flakes and freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano on top and voila!! If you think you can get away with putting the fake cheap stuff on top, nope! It sure won't be the same. This was great. I can see it being served at any Italian restaurant with some chicken and veggies on the side. I had it by itself because I'm \"carbing up\" for a long run tomorrow ;o)",

You can find a product called Fideo in the Latin section, which is small packages (8 oz.) of broken spaghetti, if you don't want the mess of breaking spaghetti into pieces. You can also add some chopped onion when browning the pasta, and a can of diced tomatoes with the broth to get a totally different flavor. Either way, you will be tempted to eat the whole pan yourself!! Thanks!!",

Using the box technique of browning the spaghetti & rice in butter, adding stock, seasonings, covering and simmering.  The kids never knew the difference.  As yrs have gone by, this is my go to for a quick and easy scampi dish.  Adding rice, lemon, shrimp, lots of garlic, red pepper flake etc.  You can make this dish into just about anything for either a side or main dish.  Serving with cooked chicken breasts (any way, think lemon chicken for one) on top with an array of seasoning options, fresh parsley...the possibilities are endless.  To give this a poor rating just means you have to broaden your imagination and not be afraid to try as written and experiment.  Excellent recipe to put out there...Thank you for sharing with others Chef John!",
