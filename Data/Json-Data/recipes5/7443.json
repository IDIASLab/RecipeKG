I didn't have cream, so I used buttermilk and omitted the lemon, and it was perfect. And (I blush to admit this but oh well) I used a packet of apple cinnamon muffin mix in place of the flour. So yeah, these were pretty incredible. \n\nI tripled the recipe last night, and it was great for our big family. I've already got another bowl in the fridge for more tomorrow! Thanks for another winner, Chef John! :)",

I accidentally put a half a teaspoon of baking soda instead of a quarter of a teaspoon I was a little concerned but it didn\u2019t seem to have any negative affect. I left them in the fridge overnight the first batch of four I just dropped in to the frying pan and then smooshed them out which was fine. The second batch of 4 I rolled into a flattened ball and put them in the pan that way.. I prefer the latter. They are absolutely delicious and just completely soak up the maple syrup. These will definitely be on the menu regularly! I had both kinds of oats but I decided to do the quick oats without cooking them option as I do not like to cook/burn milk products very much so if I can avoid it I certainly will lol",
