There are however, some differences in the recipe that you could try.   1st being....use sliced almonds instead of walnuts for the crunch layer.  Walnuts have too much flavor and they have a tendency to over power everything else.  2nd is the frosting.... the Bubble room version has a cream cheese frosting... 1/2 cup softened unsalted butter                8oz softened cream cheese                1 tsp. vanilla                2 cups sifted 10x sugar                1 tsp. orange juice                1/2 tsp grated orange peel.  I tend to like a lot of icing.. i think it makes the cake look so much better so i usually double the icing recipe.    Other than that.... its a 5 star winner.... hope you will try the changes.. :) by the by... the picture of the 3 layer cake is mine.. :)",

Even two strict dieters were \"caught\" in the leftovers the next day. I've made it twice for fund raising dinners at our American Legion Post and everyone loves it. Now it has become my signature cake and I'm always asked to make it. I use chopped pecans instead of walnuts and also use fresh squeezed orange juice from the oranges grown here in Arizona. There's something special about picking fresh fruit and using it in the recipe. I may try a lemon version in the future.The graham cracker crumbs lend a wonderful flavor and texture in the crunch and it's fun when this mystery ingredient can't be identified by all who try it! The recipe also works well when baked in a 9\"x 13\" pan. Thanks for the super recipe! \r\n",

The use of canned icing and whipped topping results in something very artificial and waxy tasting to me. I think a whipped cream cheese frosting with the citrus zest would probably be good. Also, I made this in a 9x13 pan instead of layers, turning it out to cool on a wire rack after 15 minutes cooling in the pan and then putting it back in the 9x13 with the crunch layer on top after it was completely cooled. Very tasty and the crunchy nut layer is a prize-winner!",

Until I knew how to make it I used to make my sister buy me a slice while on her vacation and bring it back to Orlando for me. I use sliced almonds instead of walnuts for the crunch layer and use the cream cheese frosting just as settlindown outlined... 1/2 cup softened unsalted butter 8oz softened cream cheese 1 tsp. vanilla 2 cups sifted 10x sugar 1 tsp. orange juice 1/2 tsp grated orange peel. I use 1 times frosting for a two layer and double the frosting for the traditional 3 layer. I also use 1 1/2 times the amount for the crunch layer and pack it firmly with the bottom of a glass. This seems to keep it from crumbling when frosting. I noticed this time I used hand squeezed OJ (Valencia oranges) and the flavor didn't seem as orange. I really like orange and preferred it better when I used the processed OJ but was able to compensate by using a bit more orange peel. Love love love this cake!!!! My photo is the one with the sliced almonds around the sides.",
