        "description": "I used to live in Sicily, and these were a favorite of mine! 'Arancini' means 'Little Oranges' in Italian, named so because the little breaded rice balls resemble small oranges so much. While so many versions include only cheeses and meats, this version is a delightful combination of white cheese and spinach.  We love it! This can be made the night or a couple of days ahead of time, and cooked at the last minute for a surprising treat for guests. I like to serve mine on a bed of fresh Radicchio. Some people enjoy dipping them into Marinara or sour cream based dips.  Enjoy!",

The only things I did differently were to omit the saffron (as I had none on hand) and used extra virgin olive oil for the frying insteead of regular vegetable oil. I probably used more spinach than specified too. But it came out wonderful. These were gobbled up at a drink/appetizer party I had recently. Great recipe so thanks to a fellow Albuquerquean!",

I used a 1\" scoop to help form them, scooping up some of the rice mixture, pressing the cheese into it, then mounding more of the rice mixture onto it.  The scoop made it easy to form and unload the balls.  Once the balls were formed and rolled, the frying went quickly since I was able to fit about 20 at a time in my pan.  The recipe yielded 80 for me.  I have a lot that I froze, and today I found that heating the frozen ones about 15 minutes at 350 degrees  got them to just the right temperature.",
