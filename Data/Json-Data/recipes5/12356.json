It was 4:30 pm and I had forgotten about dinner, frozen pork chop recipe to the rescue. It was awesome, I used seasoning on hand- garlic salt, pepper, little bit of steak seasoning and granulated garlic. I must have had a little too much broth, so to get my gravy thickened up I added a bit of corn starch at the last few minutes. Pork chops were tender and gravy was perfect over mashed potatoes with broiled artichokes and green beans.",
