I made them in a 11x8\" pan and think they would be even better (thicker) in a 8x8\" pan.  I did not use the frosting, instead I melted some chocolate chips and drizzled on top.  This was only for decoration, as more chocolate really was not needed.  Next time, I think I will skip even that.  My description of these bars is like pecan pie, only with chocolate chips instead of pecans and a cookie crust!  So gooey and good!  P.S. The recipe does not say to grease the pan, but I would.  The brown sugar mixture tended to stick to the pan.",
