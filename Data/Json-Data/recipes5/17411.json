They were bite size. My sister and I don't like nuts so we left out the egg white and the nuts but other than that we follewed the recipe exactly. This is now my household's favorite cookie and since all of a sudden my new hobbie is baking we are going to be cooking these up all the time. MAke sure after they are done cooking and have been sitting on the rack for 5 min not to each them b/c you just won't want to stop. They taste best when they are cooled. Thanks for an awesome recipe!",
