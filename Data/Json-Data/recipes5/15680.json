This is extremely delicious.  I don't know what it was called, she just said it was something her mom used to make when she was younger. Depending on how spicy you like it, you omit or ramp up any variety of hot spices you like.  This is great served over rice with shredded cheese and sour cream -- or even with corn bread. It is really versatile.",

While putting it together I felt that 3 cans of tomatoes were too many but it ended up being the right amount. I also considered not adding the cream cheese but it gave a really nice creaminess to the stew. Next time I will actually add less chicken - I think half will be enough. The recipe didn't state to shred the chicken but I did. You need a large crock pot for this recipe! Thanks Mshellz2u! I will have some yummy leftovers for awhile!",

For the diced tomatoes used 4 10 oz. cans of Rotel Hot Diced Tomatoes w/ Habaneros. For Taco Seasoning used 6 tsp. of Taco Seasoning I by B. Echols from this site. We choose to make this as a soup leaving the extra flavorful liquid (if making as a stew reserve the liquid for use in other dishes). The addition of cream cheese is a nice twist but this soup can easily stand on its own. The habanero peppers definitely ramped up the heat but perfect for us. We used a 6 qt. slow cooker and it was full to within an inch of overfilling and we probably used at least a pound less of chicken. Our cooking time was 4 hrs. on low and followed by 2 hrs. on high.

The flavor sounded great and the recipe seemed quick to put together- boy was I right! I made only 2 changes to the recipe which was to use boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast and low fat cream cheese at the end. This recipe really was SO easy. If you can operate a can opener you are pretty much done. After 10 hours on low the chicken essentially shred itself. The key is definitely using good quality pantry items. I used a Salsa Verde that is my absolute favorite from Trader Joes and a higher quality can of diced tomatoes which I think helped with the depth of flavor. I will definitely be making this again!",
