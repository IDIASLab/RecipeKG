And in my case, that meant more shrimp and  less pasta because Hubs and I aren't spring chickens anymore and have to watch our calories and carbs.

I was really worried my husband wouldn't like it (he's picky about seafood dishes) but after one bite, he declared his approval and I squealed with delight.  This dish is amazing (and SUPER simple!)  I didn't have any shallots, but I used half a diced white onion and it was superb.  I think I also used a bit more butter than what was called for, but hey.  It's was Valentine's Day!  I left out the wine (again, didn't have any) but now that my husband likes it, I plan to sneak it in there the next time I make it...and there will be a next time.  The lemon makes it taste fresh and yummy and delicious.  I would say I'm looking forward to the leftovers, but we ate the whole thing!  I'm happy report that this will be making an appearance in our kitchen again and I'd love to try it with a combination of shrimp, lobster, and/or crab.  I truly can't say enough about this recipe.  It's great!",
