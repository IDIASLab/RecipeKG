I made Lamb Kabobs with it for 11 people and made 40 Kabobs with lamb and 40 each of chicken and shrimp- the lamb was the only ones that were completly devoured. Even the guests that did not like lamb LOOVVEED it! I could not find any Asian Chile paste but what I did find was Asian Curry paste- so I used that instead and just omitted the Curry. Gonna make this again very very soon!",

On top of that we had to leave the boneless leg of lamb in the marinade for about 48 hrs. But we seared the roast on the grill first and then put it on the rotisserie and it was perfect. Even those who don't like the spicy stuff thought the lamb was fantastic. Will definitely use this marinade again.",
