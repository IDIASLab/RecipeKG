I never knew you could make a pecan pie without corn syrup. But YOU CAN and it's better than I ever imagined. The only thing I did different is I accidentally bought dark brown sugar so I just used 3/4 dark and 1/4 white to tone it down a bit. Worked a treat. ",

I would give this pie 5 stars for the flavor and ease however I can only give it 4 stars because the baking time like other viewers said was way off!! There was no way this pie was going to be done in 40 min! I believe mine baked for 1 1/2 hours. I kept checking it after an hour and it wasn't set yet. When it was all the way done however it was perfect!!! Make sure to put aluminum foil around the edges for this pie because of the length of time it needs to bake! This will be my pecan pie recipe every Thanksgiving from here on out...Thank you so much!!",
