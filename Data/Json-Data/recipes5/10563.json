Figured I'd pour the stock in anyway (I used chicken stock since I didn't have veal stock) and just see what happened...it still tasted unbelievable. \n\nPoured this sauce over a broiled Rib-eye -- one of the best meals I've had in ages, restaurants included. \n\nAlso -- I only had 1 shallot but I put in the same amount of liquid and let it reduce a lot. It was still quite good.",
