It made the sauce turn from bright red to a little darker red but nobody detected anything different in the color or taste of the sauce. It's a great way to incorporate an extra dose of greens into a family favorite undetected by my not-so-green-loving kids. A great vitamin-packed puree! I typically freeze these purees in an ice cube tray and then transfer the cubes to a freezer bag then thaw them in glass in the fridge overnight or in the microwave.",
