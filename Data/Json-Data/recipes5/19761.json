I had 1 lb of ground turkey in the fridge, so it was perfect. It tasted pretty close to what I know as sausage, but boy was it peppery! When I measured out the spices I tried to use level spoons of the spices, because I was worried about all the pepper, red and black. To make even sized patties, I used a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop and did 2 scoops per patty and made 10. I am not sure how to change this, with the pepper. It might be just me, but whenever I have bought store bought patties I always bought the maple brown sugar sausage patties, if they have them. I may just like a sweeter breakfast sausage. But, they all got eaten.",
