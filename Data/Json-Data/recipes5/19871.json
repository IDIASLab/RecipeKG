I didn't have baking soda, so substituted 4.5 tsp of baking powder which needed a little extra boiling water to dissolve; I also used corn syrup as a sub for the golden syrup. I drizzled a touch of maple syrup on the dough after it was all mixed, for a little sweetness and extra stickiness. I might cut the ginger in half if I made them again, but my husband liked the recipe as I made it! We like our cookies on the flat and crunchy side so I pressed the dough balls down good before baking, and they came out nice and brown in ~10 minutes (a little less, because my oven runs hot).",
