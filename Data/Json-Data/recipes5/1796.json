I followed the recipe to the letter except for adding a good grind of fresh pepper. The potato salad has a nice tang and although pretty tasty the dressing was a bit on the runny side so I might cut back just a bit on the buttermilk the next time. The recipe instructs you to cut up the potatoes after 10 minutes out of the water and I d suggest you be sure to do that. The warm potatoes will soak up the dressing better than using room temp potatoes. If you like ranch dressing I think you ll like this recipe a lot. chels420 thanks for sharing.",

I would recommend using this as a start but adding more flavorful ingredients to give it some real flavor. I added some red onions for some great onion flavor and some celery. I think I would add more flavoring as well the next time.",
