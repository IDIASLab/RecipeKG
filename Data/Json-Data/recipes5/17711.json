When we are ready to make the cookies, we just take the bag of dough out of the fridge, and roll them into balls and bake them on a greased cookie sheet.  It is fairly sticky though, most recipes like this are. But this way, you don't have to worry about rolling out the dough, and making a sticky mess :)    Also, we wait for the cookies to cool, then dip the top in the lemon glaze, that way more glaze stays on the cookies, and doesn't just slide off of them because they're so hot :)",

I Just tried this recipe and it's WAY better than I was expecting. Has the same texture I remember and the flavor is not too spicy but mellow. I used white sugar instead of brown (figuring why bother using brown with so much molasses). I also divided the recipe and made half of it with an additional cup of ground almonds and a tsp of almond extract just to see the difference. Both ways were perfect and I will be gifting these to my friends as well as adding them to my \"must haves\" for Christmas. Yes the dough is sticky but if you roll them into balls and flatten them (greased hands help) and use parchment paper on your cookie sheets then they make the cutest little circles and bake in about 10 minutes at 375F. (I didn't even bother to chill just used my cookie scoop aka tiny ice cream scoop on the soft dough then rolled in my hands and used plastic wrap to press on top into rounds to keep my hands clean).",
