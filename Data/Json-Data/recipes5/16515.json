Next time I would use more ground walnuts - I used double what the recipe called for but couldn't taste it at all. I ground the walnuts in our coffee grinder - so easy! I used dried cranberries because I didn't have any dates around. The batter looks like cake batter. I refrigerated the batter for about 24 hours due to time constraints and the extra fridge time did them no harm. I also found 400F to be too hot: 8-10 minutes at 375 is plenty for these cookies.",
