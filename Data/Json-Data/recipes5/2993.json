And it was awesome. We served this at Thanksgiving and wound up doubling the recipe (made 4-5 times dressing also.) I added just a bit of red vinegar because we were running short of lemon juice and it tastes amazing. I even took some of my sister's feta (shhh!) so I can make it again once we're out of the leftovers. A nice light salad for whatever type of dinner! I will DEFINITELY make this again.",
