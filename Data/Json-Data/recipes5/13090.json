I used some leftover shredded chicken and then  seeded my tomatoes first so the juice wouldn't water down the mixture. I also added a diced jalape\u00f1o to the mix. My cucumber was small, like a pickle, so I used two and even then I had a bit of mix left over that I served in an avocado. I also added in some Sriracha and think I will do it again next time I make them! Thank you for the recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "The chicken mixture with the cucumber was delicious. I took these to a party and they were a hit. I did not use the pretzels there was no way they could fit tucked in the small rolls. I tried eating the two together to see if it was worth it to put smaller pretzel pieces on top. I don't think the pretzel taste added anything. The ingredient list stated \"English cucumber halved crosswise\". To me this means cutting through the center of the cucumber leaving you with two shorter cucumbers. I suppose if you didn't cut crosswise you would get a longer slice that would fit more chicken and the pretzel. Doing this would let the filling drop out of the bottom I felt. Please let me know if I misinterpreted the directions!",
