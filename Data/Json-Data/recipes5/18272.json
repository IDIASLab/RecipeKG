You would not cook a pork tenderloin for 3 hours as stated.  They need about 20-30 minutes per pound.  If you take this into consideration, this recipe is really good.  I followed the recipe as directed except I only baked it for about 1/2 hour, then poured off about 1/2 of the apple juice and then covered the meat with the apple butter mixture and baked about another 45 minutes to an hour at the most.  After it was done, I sliced the meat, plated it and drizzled just a bit of the cooking sauce over it.  The meat picks up so much of the flavor.  Everyone just loved it.  I served it with Cheesy Mashed Potatoes and acorn squash.",

The apple  butter and the spice complemented the pork nicely....pork seems to beg for fruit.\n\n***One note I will make about this recipe....The cooking time indicates that the recipe is actually for a boneless pork *loin*, not a pork *tenderloin*.  I work in a meat market and people refer to pork *loins* as *tenderloins* quite frequently.   They are actually two different cuts of meat, the *LOIN* is from outside the curve of the rib bone and the *tenderloin* is from the inside of the curve of the rib bone.  A pork *loin* when sliced will yield slices that are roughly 3\" by 5\".   A pork *tenderloin* will yield slices slightly larger in diameter than a silver dollar.   A whole pork *tenderloin* will cook in 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees.  If you cooked a *tenderloin* for the time stated in the recipe you'd wind up with a weapon, not a roast.   Sorry to sound so preachy...this is a wonderful recipe!",

Based on the reviews I cooked at a reduced temp of 300 adding the apple butter mixture after about an hour (internal temp was around 110). By the 2 hour mark the temp had reached 170 and was quickly shooting past...the center-cut slices were still quite juicy but the end cuts bordered on dry. I'll need to watch more carefully next time. I made a gravy with the remaining cider/drippings -- to make pour what remains from roasting pan into a saucepan whisk in a cornstarch/water mix (dissolving cornstarch seperately first helps prevent lumps start with about 4 Tbs cornstarch) and bring to a boil over med-high heat whisking constantly until thickened adding more cornstarch if needed to achieve desired consistency. I never expected it but the gravy is what made this recipe a hit with my guests - it's a tremendous flavor booster and helps band-aid any dry slices!",
