With 2 large chicken breasts (about 1/2 lb each),I used 1/4 teaspoon of paprika, celery salt, and ground black pepper.  1 tablespoon of fresh Lemon juice over the meat after sprinkling with the dry ingredients.  I omitted the cream of mushroom soup and just used 1 can  of cream of celery with 1/4 can of reduced fat milk and 1/3 cup of white wine.  The whole thing sat in the crock pot for about 6 hours.  It came out tasting wonderful.  =)  Thank you for the great recipe.",

In a bowl I mixed 2 tbsp. of fresh lemon juice, 1 tsp. of paprika, 1/2 tsp. of ground black pepper.  I then brushed the breast with mixture, put in a zip lock bag added remaining mixture to bag which wasn't much.  Put in fridge.  I diced up some fresh celery and onion and put in a seperate bag.  Next morning I put chicken in crockpot, mixed together my fresh celery/onion with one can of cream of mushroom soup 99% fat free and in place of sherry used 1/2 cup of chicken broth and half cup of grated parmesen cheese. Poured over chicken and dinner was ready when we got home.  Served with brown rice and a salad.  Simple comfort food.  Thank you so much for the post.",

I used low-sodium soups so I think it might have been the cheap cooking sherry I used. When will I learn never to use a wine bought in the condiment section of the grocery store!;o) While it was a little salty it was still pretty good. I also used thin chicken breasts & thought they were a little overcooked; I only cooked them on low for about 6 hrs... maybe it was because I only used four breasts? I added some chopped mushroooms & celery because I had some on hand then I added 3 cloves of minced garlic because I love garlic. The garlic did complement the flavors of the sauce a lot. I added a little more than 1/2 c. of low sodium chicken broth to the sauce about halway through the cooking...I guess it needed it because of the lack of juices from the missing chicken. I did not add the parmesan to the crockpot (so I can't blame the saltiness of the sauce on that). Instead after it had cooked I transfered the chicken to a glass baking dish & sprinkled them w/ the parmesan & put them under the broiler until the cheese was melted & golden. Then I poured the sauce around the chicken being careful not to pour it on the chicken thereby maintaining my beautiful cheese topping. I served it w/ boiled new potatoes (really good w/ the sauce) & pan-fried asparagus (from this site). All in all a very good meal but it will better the next time I make it w/ a quality sherry.",
