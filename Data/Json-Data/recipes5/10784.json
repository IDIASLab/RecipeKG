I decided that I would try a similar dish with the cod in a red curry next time. This is the only Chef John recipe that I haven't given 5 stars.",

So I'll be that typical annoying post that says everything I changed but honestly it is not intentional it's just what I had on hand. 1) My grocery store only had regular Cod filets (not sure that's a huge deal) so I used that 2) I never cook with vegetable oil so I used olive oil and 3) I don't have a strainer - so my curry was chunky but absolutely delicious. I wasn't sure how I'd like the strawberries in this but I think that's the magic that tied it all together for me. A spoonful of everything together - so good! Thank you for an easy healthy recipe Chef John!",
