These cookies were SO naughty. These were so easy to make they came together in a flash and what was great about this cookie dough was that it didn't need to be chilled. Huge timesaver for someone who needed a batch of cookies pronto. Also this was great using pantry items I always have with a little bendability on the pudding mix and flavored chips used. Try the cinnamon chips in this recipe yourself. Or not. It's pretty dangerous for those watching their figures!;)",
