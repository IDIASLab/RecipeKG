I put up photo of soup before blending because it looks so good like that. May have it that way next time. Now for the taste. It was the balanced blend of flavors that makes this soup amazing. You taste the rich umami qualities of the mushrooms and the gentler flavors of the potatoes and seasonings. I think for folks who don't like mushroom texture this would be a great enhancement to many foods as the texture completely disappears.  It is great as a soup and I'm going to use it as/in gravy, add-on for other soup, over veggies, in dips, over brown rice, pasta... : ) Thanks for this recipe! 5 Stars!",

Slight changes I made were to replace the butter with ghee chives with scallions vegetable broth instead of bouillon and I used a combination of red and purple potatoes and I never peel potatoes. I used a teaspoon of all the spices since I doubled the recipe. I threw in fresh minced garlic for kicks. Most definitely will make this again!",

The only changes I made were that I used Shitake mushrooms for about 1/3 of the total mushrooms used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and used a greater amount of mushrooms than the recipe calls for.
