Everything in this recipe is something almost everyone has. The only reason I subtracted one star is because cooking the meatballs in the sauce makes for a LOT of fat in the final recipe. Also, I made this recipe with 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 sausage. That was MY mistake, NOT the recipe's. The sausage flavor was too strong for this sauce so, if you are thinking of doing this.. you shouldn't. Overall, the recipe was a huge success. Thank you.",
