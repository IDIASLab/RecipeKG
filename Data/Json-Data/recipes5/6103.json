It was good but I wondered if the flavor would have been more enhanced with maybe fresh ginger or maybe a touch of cayenne. We ate it as a main course rather than as a salad ingredient. I think that if it were for a salad that cooking it stovetop would work best. I will try it that way next time Injured Mule. Thanks!",
