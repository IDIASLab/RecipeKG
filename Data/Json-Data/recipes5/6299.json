This is a perfect side salad to a grilled steak to serve with a frittata for brunch or even to top a thin crust prosciutto pizza.

I was not familiar with shallots and I liked the way they flavored the dressing without being over-powering like raw onion or garlic. My only changes to dressing were using a different oil not having olive oil. Also believe I used white wine vinegar instead of rice. Unfamiliar with shallots I just minced about 2 tsp. When done I also added a sprinkle of garlic salt. Already planning this dressing again.",
