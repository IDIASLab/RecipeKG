Otherwise I followed the recipe (with no idea what size the potatoes should really be) but it came out too thick in my opinion. So I added extra cream until it thinned down some but it was still too thick to my liking. The flavor is quite savory and you can taste the undertones of onion and garlic. The hot sauce didn't come through at all. I guess I expected it to be sweeter because of the coconut milk and heavy cream. I suspect my potatoes were too large. I wish recipes like this called for a certain cup amount of mashed potatoes.",
