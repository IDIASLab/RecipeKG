As he always does he used Montreal Steak Seasoning rather than pepper and, knowing my preferences in Bloody Mary's, cut way back on the lemon juice. The pickled pepper juice was a new addition and I liked it - it was an interesting twist.  Didn't have cilantro and wouldn't have used it in a Bloody Mary if I had. Hubs just garnished it with my usual celery stick and three gargantuan stuffed green olives!  Enjoyed this immensely as I was doing the prep work for our dinner,  so that didn't allow for refrigerating it for eight hours!",

I somewhat eyeballed the rest of ingredients with a few adjustments due to what I had on hand. Did 1/2 of lemon juice amount. I have one of those Ninja Pros and blended some of the cocktail juice with cubes of frz lemon and lime juice and used Pepperoncini (minus it's juice). My additions (I read quite a few recipes) - 1/4 C tangerine juice 2 T steak sauce 1 tsp beef base. I ground up celery seed sea salt and coriander in my spice grinder. Also used 1 T Tabasco versus standard hot sauce. I started with this recipe but with my few mods - fabulous! I use the mix to make one awesome drink at a time. Thanks for a great starting point Hawkeye and the idea of adding cilantro is just what I was looking for.",
