Although vinegar was not called for in the recipe the sherry and ginger together make for a pH extreme. Also mango chutney's vary greatly depending on the brand & this ingredient was the most prominent as per volume in the sauce. Perhaps it would have been better if I had used the same brand as the recipe's author?",

I used some dry Chinese rice wine in place of the sherry as that was what I had and ended up enjoying how it balanced the sweetness of the chutney and complemented the ginger quite nicely. The only negative for me was that even 30 minutes at 350 F wasn't even close to long enough to get my fish flaky which meant that my potatoes sat on the stove a little longer than I'd have liked.",
