I made the recipe as written except that we do not have tuna in olive oil available in my demographic so had to settle for tuna \"in oil\" which was soybean oil and I used whole wheat penne. With the olive oil the garlic and onions were sauted in combined with the oil the tuna was packed in this was incredibly oily--so much so that I think I gained 10 lbs just by looking at it (I wouldn't eat it). The DH and the kiddos thought it was extremely bland and unflavored. I may try this again someday--if I do my overhaul will include using tuna packed in water not oil and I will use a packet of alfredo sauce mix to give it a cohesive flavor base. This is a very creative recipe--I like the combination of the tuna garbanzos and olives--just needs some work IMHO.:)",

This came out decently tasty and I would probably make again if I had stuff on hand to use up. I tweaked this recipe slightly. I used about 8 cloves of garlic (I like it a lot). I also used tuna in water instead of olive oil after reading some reviews that said this was overly oily. I didn't add water so it's a little on the dry side but not too much. I am not sure why people said this recipe is tasteless I added plenty of salt and pepper and it tastes fine to me!",
