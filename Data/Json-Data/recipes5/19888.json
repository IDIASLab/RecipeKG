Once I started making it I realized it fit in an 8x8 pan but it had a full 1 1/2 sticks of butter! After I mixed the 1st 3 ingredients it had a nice flavor until I added the sugar. Then it just got over-poweringly SWEET yet when it was baked it was SUPER GREASY! In my dish it was sitting in a mound of \"orange grease.\" The tomato taste behind all of the sugar and butter was good but it was just so heavily masked. I think I will just keep making my stewed tomatoes on the stove which also has bread but is simpler to make healthier and tastes like fresh tomatoes. The concept sounded good as I love tomatoes but maybe I just didn't get it?",
