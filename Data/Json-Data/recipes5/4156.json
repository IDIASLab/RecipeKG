Whirl up the garlic and olive oil - set aside in a small jar there is no need to strain it. The garlic will settle to the bottom and the oil will rise. Use the top oil to coat the bread. Mix up the dressing toss with the chicken. The the only thing that should be made up at the end is tossing the salad dressing with the salad dressing - OO Lemon juice Salt Pepper & garlic - taste test it and remember you can always add a bit more garlic but you cannot take it out. They are not the easiest appy to eat standing up but they sure are delicious.",
