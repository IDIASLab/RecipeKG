The anchovy wasn't missed at all the Worcestershire sauce provided a good savory note. Either would do fine on it's own. What was missing was acid. With only 2 teaspoons of mustard to brighten? cup oil the flavor was quite muddy and flat. After adding 1 tablespoon lemon juice it was considerably improved. With that modification 4 stars.",
