To achieve rough-chopped olives & avoid turning it into sludge I put rinsed pitted olives - one can at a time - in the Ninja container with enough plain water to 2/3rds full so the olives could move freely then pulsed the power button just until the olives were rough-chopped drained them in a sieve dumped them in a large mixing bowl and repeated the process using 3 cans green olives & 2 cans black olives. Mixed in chopped roasted red peppers capers garlic thyme oregano Dijon mustard S&P lime juice a small squirt of Sriracha and oil to nearly cover it. (1/3 EVOO to 2/3 canola since EVOO solidifies under refrigeration and I wanted to avoid that.) Refrigerated several hours to let the flavors marry. Liking it as a topper on broiled salmon as well as zucchini 'noodles.'",
