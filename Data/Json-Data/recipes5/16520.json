They just have a hint of sweetness and have a nice cakey texture but are still quite sturdy and hold together.  I used light sour cream and cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  I think any spice would be really great, next time I'll add more cinnamon or maybe try the nutmeg also.  Great little cookies and super easy recipe!  A recipe I'll definitely make again and again.",
