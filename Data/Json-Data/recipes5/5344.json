I didn't have any white wine so I didn't add it and honestly I don't feel like it's missing anything. I put about three times the amount of capers but left the caper juice at what was called for. I also put much more dill. SOOOOO good! I'm making cheese tortellini to go with it all and plan to put the sauce onto the pasta.",

Succulent juicy salmon and a sacue to die for. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it. Now I can have affordable yummylicious salmon any time!!!",

The salmon turned out wonderful and the pasta was creamy and flavorful. My husband didn't want to try at it at first because it had mayo in it but once I convinced him he loved it. So did the kids.

Me and my family didn't like it that much and I won't be making it again. I guess this is a good recipe for people that like a cream sauce on their salmon. For us we prefer a light and fresh taste for salmon as opposed to a heavy cream sauce.",
