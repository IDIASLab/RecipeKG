I baked the rolls for about 7 minutes before topping it with sauce, then Eggbeaters, more sauce, chopped Oscar Meyer Virginia Ham, & a very light layer of mild cheddar.  Baked it for about 10 more minutes & served with steamed asparagus--DELICIOUS!!  I used Knorr Hollandaise Sauce & store brand crescent rolls.  I baked mine at 375 degrees for a total of maybe 20 minutes~~ 30 minutes seems liked it would be WAY too long to bake-would make the sauce disappear IMO.  My Husband & Son love Hollandaise Sauce-I'm not a huge fan, but it was wonderful on this \"pizza\"!!  Thank you for a interesting twist on Eggs Benedict!",

It is very filling and is great idea for a quick dinner. My kids love this! I like it but I'm not sold on the cresent crust. I feel it overpowers the other flavors. I took the other's advise and precooked the crust and only baked it for 18 minutes. I will be making this on a regular basis but will try alternatives to the cresent dough and will add additional hollandaise on top of the eggs before the cheese. Update: I have tried various alternatives to the cresent roll crust because I just couldn't get past the flavor of it. Recently I made the recipe using Pilsbury Pizza Dough and it made all the difference in the world! Everyone preferred the pizza dough option. I used the pilsbury directions for baking the crust. Bake for 8 min remove from oven add toppings and then bake for additional 14 min. I also used only 6 eggs and it was just right.",
