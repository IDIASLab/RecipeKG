                "reviewBody": "Ok this was a fantastic recipe to start with. I only made a few minor changes: 1-I lightly breaded the chops before browning as a matter of fact I did not egg wash them I just coated with flour & then browned. 2-I chopped an onion & threw it into the pan to saute close to the end of the chops browning. And then put the onion into bake with the chops. 3-I used a small (14.5 oz) can of diced tomatoes instead of tomatoe sauce. NOTE when I tried this recipe I used about 1/2 inch thick bone-in chops & it only took about 30 min NOT 1 hour to bake so keep an eye out. This dish was wonderful served with rice on the side you can even spoon some of the liquid from the chops pan onto the rice.....Try this recipe you & or your family will thank you for trying it!!",

I mixed all of the ingredients together and added a tsp. of worcestershire sauce then just slathered it on the boneless chops. I then poured the tomato sauce over it (a larger can) and baked it for the recommended time. It was fantastic. My husband and I had the leftovers the next day over rice. We had both the dinner and leftovers with Brussels sprouts and it was phenomenal. Great recipe thanks a million this will go into the recipe box as a winner!;-)",

I was looking for something easy and different. This was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good. I thought it may have been too much liquid because I used really thin pork chops but I still followed the recipe to a tee and it worked out perfectly. I didn't cook them in the oven for an hour since they were thin chops I kept an eye on them and probably only needed to cook them for about 1/2 hour before they reached 160 degrees. The sauce reminded me of my grandmother's home made barbeque sauce. DELICIOUS!! Thanks!",

Used only half of the brown sugar ( actually used a dark Molasses sugar ) added some worchestshire sauce to the tomato sauce topping the chops with one sliced onion and afew minced garlic cloves to kick-up the flavor of the sauce some. Was very good served with mashed potatoes green beans and fresh fruit. I will make this again.",

This might be something I would do in the crockpot instead. After 20 mins. in the oven (350)the internal temp. on my boneless chops was 170 degrees.
