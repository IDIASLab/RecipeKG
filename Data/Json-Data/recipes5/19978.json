                "reviewBody": "These were very very good.  I have been making a variation of these for 3 decades using a marinade I got from the old Steak and Ale restaurants when I was a bartender there while in college.  That marinade consisted of the pineapple juice, sherry and soy sauce in a 3:2 ratio in the order listed.  I always added some ginger also, either 1 inch of grated fresh or 2 tsp. dried.  I also marinate the pineapple slices separately in another ziplock and grill the entire can of slices.  My family always wanted several slices of pineapple served on top of their grilled chicken breasts.  The real key is the time you marinate and I do that for at least 8 hours or overnight.  Makes the meat so juicy that way because the acid in the juice helps tenderize the meat. This also works well on a nice cut of steak, the old 'Kensington Club' on S&A's menu. Same marinade. Your brown sugar addition makes a nicer glaze as it carmelizes while grilling so you get 5 + stars!!  Wild rice and steamed broccoli or asparagus goes great along with a mixed greens salad.  Thank you for a great recipe with the addition of your spices and brown sugar. I did decrease the amount of brown sugar the second time I made this recipe because the sherry I have always added made it too sweet with the amount of brown sugar called for. I do like your recipe very much and I use it when I don't happen to have sherry on hand. Try it my way once and decrease the brown sugar by half along with adding the ginger. Thanks again.!",
