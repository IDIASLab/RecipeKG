Also used to make bbq beef sandwiches and I couldn't get enough sauce on the sandwich to taste it without the heat getting over the top. Soooo I guess depending on how I use it I would need to alter the amount of ground chipotle. The flavor was good until the heat built up and masked it. I don't think I would make this again for beef or sandwiches as written. Made for recipe group 9/3/12",
