I also needed to add a sprinkle more brown sugar to take away some of the saltiness from the soy. I think it's all in personal preferences but it would be a good idea to use less b/c you can always add more if you would like! My husband loved it. I grilled bone-in chicken ( yes w/ skin!) for about 10 minutes and then placed in a 9 x13 & poured the sauce over each piece and covered with foil. I baked it at 375 until the pieces were done- approximately 25-30 minutes. I think this would also be great over pulled pork. A gourmet sauce!",
