When cool I place them in a colander and rinse (yes I rinse them) with hot water. This drains the grease so you don't have any \"swimming\" on top of the sauce. Then I add them to the sauce and simmer for an hour. The meatballs came out wonderful!! I did not use any onions nor water and used tomato sauce instead of soup.",

Thank you so AgentLucy for her suggestions for how to cook the meatballs; it saved me a lot of trouble. I used 3/4 cup breadcrumbs & 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. I only used a splash of milk so they wouldn't be too dry. I also used 1 tsp italian seasoning instead of parsley. Using all the milk would have been a disaster! I baked them rinsed them off & added them to my sauce & simmered for 30 min. They held up great in the sauce; didn't fall apart at all. Worked out wonderfully-my first attempt at meatballs was a success!",
