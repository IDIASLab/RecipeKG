I thought 6 cups of chips seemed like a lot so I used about 4 cups crushed. I was able to find the fat-free (also low sodium/no salt added) chili in the health food aisle at my grocery store. Next time I will also serve this dish with with black olives and guacamole. This dish is a lot like supreme nachos. It would be great for a party -- just spread your chips out on a sheet pan instead of in a 9x9 square serve lettuce tomato and sour cream on the side and call it nachos supreme!

After seeing this recipe I made it with the chili on the bottom some grated cheese on top of that then the crushed chips and cheese on the very top and served with the taco toppings which was a nice addition that I hadn't done before.
