I placed the wire-rack  on top of a foil-lined cookie sheet. This works great. It prevented the meatloaf from being soggy and it also allows the sauce to cover all the sides. As for the sauce, I replaced the brown sugar with honey. It  is a good compliment to the dijon mustard  and it helped thicken the sauce. Will definitely make this again, its very tasty.",

The meatloaf will keep its shape and you can \"glaze\" it with the topping put it back in the oven and it will coat it on all sides and kind of carmelize.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Great use for ground turkey--which can end up bland in some recipes. LOVED the use of fresh rosemary. I made a few changes---I used 2 lbs. of ground turkey (just because I had it) & only 1/2 cup milk & 1 cup Italian Bread Crumbs & 1 cup plain bread. By accident forgot to add the balsamic vinegar! I'll have to try it next time ---now I'm curious if it will be just as good with it. Per previous reviews I halved the amount of topping. I'm glad I did because I thought it was just sweet enough. However I read the amount wrong on the Tomato Sauce and only ended up adding 1T. with the brown sugar & dijon---I'll do the same next time because I was happy with the topping.",

We eat a lot of ground turkey here no beef ever because of intolerance issues. So we certainly know of the 99% fat free turkey products. But they tend to taste like balsa wood frankly. Pure protein always does. If you think about it boneless skinless breasts (chicken or turkey) are not the stuff of a simple saut\u00e9. You have to add something even if it s only cheese or gravy. In fact for this dish I d have added about a cup of grated cheese if it were built on the fat free type of turkey. We didn t fiddle much with the recipe at all. Made it just as is. Came out very well and the sauce is nice. It did have a vinegar flavor though. My wife thought that just made it sweeter but I was very aware of it. I do like balsamic vinegar so that was OK with me. Instead of prepared Dijon Mustard we used Colman s Mustard (the powder stuff that comes in those mustard yellow tins). It did very well but be warned this is not your grandma s mustard. This stuff is spicy hot much too hot if you re not into spicy heat at all.",

It was good but I made a couple of changes: no sugar in fact I left out the glaze - for my tastes I don't need it but Oops I forgot the garlic (might have added a little zing oh well next time) I also used dried rosemary leaves (about 1 Tbsp) used only 1/2 Cup of milk I used chopped scallions for the onions and added chopped celery. The result was a tasty loaf. Last night's turkey meatloaf was served with steamed green beans and broccoli and onion tater tots I think I'll try to serve this meal every year on the Tuesday after Labor Day.",

Ended up cooking the meatloaf for about 90 minutes till we got a 170 degree reading on our meat thermometer. (We are sticklers for safety! I think 160 would have been ok...) It was great and made clean slices no mush here! For extra pizzazz we lined the bottom of the pan with 5 slices of bacon-precooked slightly to reduce fat. Mmmmmmm! Fed the 2 of us with a green salad for 3 days with a little left over to nibble on. (we're small eaters.:) Thanks!",
