Forgot the green onions had sugar snap peas instead of regular peas and used goat cheese instead of bleu. Every bite is so full of flavor. And the dressing really brought out the flavors rather than masking them. BF didn't beleive me when I told him the secret ingredient was lemonade. I made extra dressing to have whenever I put a salad together. I'll feel a lot less guilty using this delicious dressing than smothering my salad in some creamy concoction. Spinach and Strawberry Salad has been my fav for a few years but this beats it hands down. Well done Sunny well done.",

The light lemony flavor of the dressing the various shades of green the addition of peas and fruit remind me of spring. I did substitute goat cheese for the bleu due to my own personal tastes. Truly a beautiful tasty and refreshing salad! Other than the cheese the only change I made was to toss in a handful of chopped fresh parsley because I had some left over from another dish I was making - mint would be lovely here too. I might add a bit of garlic to the dressing next time and maybe bump up the lemon juice a bit. Thanks for sharing!",
