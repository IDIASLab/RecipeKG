I added tin foil and an extra 30 minutes in the oven and the potatoes still were a tad too crisp. Perhaps using a larger casserole dish, and thinner layers? 4 potatoes may have been too many. I suggest 3. Still, flavor was spot on. Worth trying again if I can get a fix for the potatoes.",

I even thought putting it in the oven...\"this is something I would usually foil.\"   5 stars for a new way to make ground beef.  2 stars for the follow through.  This recipe I think will turn out great if:  put the potatoes on the bottom, reduce the amount of lemon juice significantly, reduce the amount of water (what was that?  I had a moat of greasy water around it) put the tomatoes on the top, and layer it so that it doesn't fall all over the place.  I will definitely try again the new way, and most likely will just get hummus to keep things simple.",
