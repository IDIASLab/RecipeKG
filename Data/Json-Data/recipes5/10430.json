That said I love Spanish chorizo too but you need far more than 2 ounces to get any flavor from it for 4 eggs. This chorizo is very hard and I use scissors to cut it up cook it then add your other ingredients. I really recommend using Mexican chorizo which imparts far more flavor and does not need a lot of chopping. Just add it to your pan and chop it as cooks with your spatula then add eggs and add the mixture to cooked corn tortillas.",
