I tried this twice the first time with the nuts and coconut it was nice but hubby didn't like it. so I tried again without nuts and coconut or raisins and I found the filling is like water even after the crust is cooked. so think next time if I do not use nuts or anything will maybe eliminate the hot water stage. If someone has any other ideas why so runny and how to stiffen it up a bit please let me know. I sometimes have to use different ingredients I find the brown sugar in this country if finer and does not have as much molasses in it as canadian brown sugar so maybe that is the diff as I used canadian brown sugar the first batch..",
