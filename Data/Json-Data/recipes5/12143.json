Followed the recipe ingredients exactly however changed a couple of procedures the second time. There is no need to break up the white chocolate and dip into the dark. Simply spread the melted dark chocolate over the white. As long as you add the shorthening the dark will stay in place when you break up the bark. I also switched from hard peppermint candies to the soft. It will not stick to your teeth the way the hard does. The candy literally melts in your mouth. Ohhh so good. Thanks for a real keeper.",

I have to say I got some aggression out while smashing the candy to smithereens which was awesome. I used a hammer. I highly suggest that method. Also I didn't bother with the measurements of the pans. While helpful as a guide let's face it this isn't meant to be a pristine uniform candy. It is like broken glass...pretty in its own right but who cares about particulars? So Daughter and I broke it up and tasted it to make sure it warranted the melted milk chocolate step...yep you can stop right there. Delicious! But take it to the next level and dip it in the chocolate?!!! Oh my! Absolutely wonderful. Too bad for everyone else as it will likely be gone before they try it. Thanks for sharing:)",
