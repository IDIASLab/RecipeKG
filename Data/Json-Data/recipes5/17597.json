The previous reviewer must have overdone an ingredient as I did not find it too be to floury or tasteless, in fact, it was quite the opposite.  The cookies were excellent and rich with flavor.  I even found this recipe better than the 5 star oat/choc cookie recipe that is so popular.  I think the key is the dark brown sugar, it just makes the whole cookie.  Excellent cookie!  I will never use another recipe again!",

I divided the dough into thirds: to one I added dried cranberries to the second chocolate chips and to the third raisins. I used a miniscoop to get fairly uniformly-sized cookies. I rolled each into a ball in my hands and gently flattened each a tiny bit. I baked the first batch for the full 20 minutes and found them a bit too crispy for my taste. I baked the chocolate chip and raisin ones only 10 minutes until just almost set and let them sit in the pan about 5 minutes then removed them with a spatula to the cooling rack. I prefer this more tender version. One nice thing about these cookies is that they are not too sweet although one CAN adjust the sweetness of course. I will definitely make these again but I probably will add more fruit or chocolate chips next time because they do spread quite a bit while baking and I like to get something in each bite.",
