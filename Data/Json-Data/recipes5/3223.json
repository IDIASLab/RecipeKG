I omitted bacon but sauteed baby portabellas and onion, added spinach and lots of feta and some romano cheese (kept the flour/butter/milk base the same). I made the egg sauce, cutting lemon juice in half, and poured over the stuffed crepes in a casserole dish. I baked at 350 for about 15 min. There was a lot of egg sauce left over though so I would probably half it next time. Turned out great!!",

The filling in this one was GREAT!! We thought the sauce a little too lemony so will cut that in half next time I do this one. Also I assembled the dish a little ahead poured the sauce over and let it set in the refrigerator for an hour or so. Then baked it in a 350 degree oven until heated through. That worked just fine.",
