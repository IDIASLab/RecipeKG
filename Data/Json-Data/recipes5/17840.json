This is absolutely the best recipe I have found for goose breast! He was pleasantly surprised with this dish and said it was better than he thought it would be. The sauce complimented the meat perfectly and the only ingredient I lacked was the caraway...it was great without it. I don't know if this makes a difference or not but my husband insists on soaking the goose breast in milk for a couple days and then juice (apple cranraspberry etc.) for a day or two. He says it removes the gamey taste. Thanks for a great easy recipe. We will definately use again!",
