I followed the recipe except for the following: I used half of the smoked sausage and pulsed it in my food processor. Then I sauteed that with the peppers onions and herbs. I just didn't want large pieces of the sausage on the pizza. It turned out perfectly delicious! It's a great combination of flavors and by chopping the sausage finely there was deliciousness in every bite. I'd definitely make it again this way. Thanks for a great dinner!!",
