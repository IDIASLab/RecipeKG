I've been making them for about 5 years & they are a staple around here.\nI use mostly apple sauce instead of all the oil (just put a skim on top) & usually add a couple of tablespoons of ground flax seed for more nutrition.\nTonight we ran out of the spelt flour we usually use (wheat allergy), so I used a rye/rice flour combo without the flax seeds.
