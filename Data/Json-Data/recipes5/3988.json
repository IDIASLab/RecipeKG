                "reviewBody": "Although there is a rustic simplicity to Dash s Donair recipe on this website this version of donair is much more satisfying so I m surprised more people haven t tried/reviewed it. The marinade adds a lot of body and flavor making the beef especially tasty. I only make a few minor changes: 1) Surprisingly I think whole wheat pita complements the dish better 2) I serve with lettuce tomatoes and onions so family members can make their own sandwiches and 3) for the sauces although I like hummus I think it takes away from the flavor of the meat in this dish. I also remove the tomatoes from the parsley sauce because I serve with fresh tomatoes. This makes the parsley sauce stronger but nestled among the meat and veggies it doesn t overwhelm. (As a side note I usually have a lot of the parsley sauce left. Instead of throwing it away I recycle it into another dish. I cut large tomatoes in half the hothouse/jersey variety spread the tops of the tomatoes with a large spoonful of the parsley sauce and bake/broil in the toaster oven for 30 minutes. It makes for an interesting twist on the tomato/pesto side dish that goes well with a lot of meat/chicken meals.) I enjoy this recipe for lunch or as a light dinner but it is particularly in demand with the menfolk during football season.",

My only complaints are that the meat was nearly over-cooked at the 30-minute mark and for some reason there was a lot of liquid that came from either the meat marinade or parsley salad that dripped out & caused the pita to get soggy on the outside. Will make again and try to be more careful about how much liquid I spoon into the pita.",
