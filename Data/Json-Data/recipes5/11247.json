Then I mixed in butter brown sugar cinnamon cream cheese one beaten egg the crushed corn flakes and a couple tablespoons of self-rising flour. Then I floured my hands and took some of the mixture placed 4 to 5 miniature marshmallows inside then rolled them into a ball and baked. I put one marshmallow on top during the last few minutes of baking. They tasted great! They tasted like sweet potato pie inside with a crusty outside.",
