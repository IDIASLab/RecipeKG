The second time I made it, I was more careful with the syrup mixture to make sure it didn't boil and that way it didn't get so hard and chewy.  I sprayed my glass dish with pam and it did not stick.  I also added a dash or two of cinnamon to the egg mixture and it was excellent.  Definitely a quick and easy dish to make and very easy to increase or decrease the size!!",

Well this recipe fit the bill.\r\n\r\nI made the french toast exactly as the recipe called for but i used regular store bought sliced cracked wheat bread instead of the unsliced white bread.  I also buttered the baking dish before putting any ingredients in it.\r\n\r\nEveryone loved it, and my sister-in-law took the recipe home with her to try it herself.\r\n\r\nI was hoping to see how any leftovers would reheat in the microwave but needless to say there wasn't a scrap left to reheat.\r\n\r\nI will definitely make this again and thank you for making our Sunday morning so enjoyable.\r\n\r\n",

I sprayed the bottome of a glass 9\"x13\" pan w/cooking spray. I let the syrup mixture come to a boil before I poured it into the pan. I layered sliced french bread, crust on, over the syrup and then poured the milk egg mixture over that. I let it sit covered overnight in the fridge. The next morning, I placed the glass pan containing the french toast into a metal pan filled with 1/2\" of water. I baked it in the oven, covered, for 30 min. I then uncovered the dish and baked it for an additional 20 min. It came out fantastic! The caramel syrup didn't stick to the pan at all and the bread was lightly toasted on top. This is one of my favorite new recipies and I know I'll make it again and again.",
