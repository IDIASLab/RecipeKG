Experimenting with different ways to prepare the delicious edamame we grow on my family farm, I stumbled upon this cold salad combination and it has been a huge hit. I'm sure that frozen produce can be substituted for many of the fresh ingredients this recipe calls for; however, you can't beat the taste of fresh local produce. Remember to frequent area farmer's markets whenever the season permits!",
