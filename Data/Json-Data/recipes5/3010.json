Not only did it satisfy my craving for a good dill dip.. this one is BETTER. I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder just to give it that *extra* kick. I really think that the key to this dip is letting it sit at LEAST 3-4 hours. I tasted it right after I made it and it was good...but after I let it sit, it was amazing. I'm ashamed to say I ate all of it with a bag of pretzles for dinner, LOL!",
