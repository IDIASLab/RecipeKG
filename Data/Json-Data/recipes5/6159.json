I used toasted almonds instead of walnuts and goat cheese instead of feta. You will find so many different flavours and textures in this salad it really is a new discovery with every bite. I mixed up the dressing and let the cranberries soak in it while I prepared the quinoa and lentils and this plumped up the dried berries so they became nice and soft when the salad was ready. This is a good recipe to use when you need a prepare ahead meal in one. Thank you CleiaBelia for sharing this recipe.",
