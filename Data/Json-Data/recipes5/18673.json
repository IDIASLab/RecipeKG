Instead of chicken thighs I used chicken breast tenderloins. I tossed the frozen tenderloins with the spice mix and let them thaw in the mixture then let them chill in the mixture all day. Because we only eat whole grains I substituted brown jasmine rice. ( Remember brown rice takes longer to cook) I also skipped the water & I mixed in the entire can of coconut milk. I followed step three (reserving the mango) except that I put the mixture in a large stove top pan with a snug lid. After bringing to a boil I simmered the rice mixture for 35 minutes. I then added the chicken tenderloins & mango to the mixture. Covered it again & cooked about 15 minutes more. This was very tasty and I liked not having to have my oven on. Next time I will serve with chopped peanuts & more fresh mango as a garnish. This is a keeper.",

By the time this came out of the oven the rice was soupy and very over-cooked. I will make this again but next time I will HALF the chicken seasoning/marinade and add some water to it so it is a rub or paste; as the recipe is there is WAY too much seasoning for the chicken. Next time I will skip adding the water and I will mix the coconut milk into the rice. This has very good potential! Thanks Toronto Mommy aye?",

Then in the morning I sprayed the mango mixture in TWO greased 9 x 13 pans (I followed the recipe exactly except did 12-14 thighs) poured the uncooked rice evenly over that (1 C in each dish)layed the chicken over it all and poured half the liquid over one dish the rest over the other making sure all the rice was submerged. Next time I might try using more lime juice or maybe some zest. Took it to a church \"international potluck\" and got rave reviews! Thanks!",
