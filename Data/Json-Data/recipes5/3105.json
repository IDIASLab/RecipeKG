I used white cake mix, and used lime juice where it called for lemon juice.  I made 2 separate batches of glaze.  I also used top shelf liquor; Jose Cuervo and Grand Mariner instead of triple sec.  Immediately when the cake came out of the oven I poked several holes in the cake and poured a shot of tequila over it, 2tbsp of grand mariner, and poured \u00bd  of one of the batches of glaze on it as well.  After allowing the cake to cool for 15 minutes I took the cake out of the pan and glazed the cake with the other half of the first batch of glaze.  Finally, about an hour later I glazed it with the 2nd batch of glaze.  I made this cake for a small, Mexican cuisine themed  get together at my house, everyone loved it So easy, moist, flavorful and delicious!  Will definitely make again!\n",

I am not a drinker, so I couldnt see spending $25.00 on alcohol to make a cake, when I will never use the tequilla and triple sec for anything else. So I bought the Cuervo Margarita Mini's (the come in a 4 pack for about 6 dollars) and only used one of them in place of the required amount of tequilla and triple sec and it still turned out great! Using the mini's really cut down on the cost and it didnt give it too strong of a tequilla flavor! I had to duble the amount of powdered sugar, the glaze was way too thin",

I read many of the reviews and decided to use yellow cake, lemon pudding, and substituted equal parts of Bacardi non-alcoholic frozen margarita mix. I don't think the Police Department would go for the Tequila and Triple Sec. I also used the margarita mix as a substitute for the liquid in the icing - except the lime juice. Nothing beats fresh lime! The cake turned out absolutely beautiful! I added more confectioner's sugar to get a nice heavy white icing, and garnised with lime twists. It was an absolute HIT!!! The party honoree took most of the cake home before everyone could eat it up! I'm not a drinker, so my husband and I asked around about wheter it actually tasted like a Margarita. Nothing but nods of approval. This was a great alcohol free alternative.",

I love the flavor of sweet and salt together (sea salt caramels anyone? chocolated covered salted pretzels? Yum). So to complete this recipe which is sweet enough to be able to carry it off I recommend you do one of two things -- sprinkle flaked kosher salt over the glaze before serving (not much is required) or do as I did another time -- crush up pretzels very finely and scatter them on top. The sensation is quite good and fun to boot (in fact when I make margarita pie I used crushed salted pretzels sugar and butter to press as the crust).",

I doubled the glaze and when I took it out of the oven, I poked holes in the bottom and put about 1/2 cup of it in and let it sit for ~10 minutes, then flipped it out on a wire rack and put the 1/3 of the remaining glaze on, waited 30 min, put 1/3 more on and waited 30 more min and put the last 1/3 on. Then, after the glaze had hardened, I squeezed lime juice on the cake and sprinkled coarse salt all over it. People really loved the sweet/salty combo, I got tons of compliments on this cake.

It kinda follows this recipe but instead of orange cake use white cake. instead of lemon juice use liquid margarita mix.  Don't use any water, instead use  1 1/8 cup tequila and 1 1/8 cup triplesec. It might seem like a lot of liquid but its not and believe me I really worked at this recipe. When it comes to the frosting just start pouring things in and see how you like it.",
