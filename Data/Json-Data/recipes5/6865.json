The hub said it was fantastic! If I had really read the instructions b4 making it I would've cooked the garbanzo beans according to the recipe and it would've been even more tasty. A tip for cooking with tofu is extra firm cut through the middle so you have two flat thin pieces salting and peppering and leaving it cut side down in a colander to strain while u prep everything else. This will cut down on the cook time as well as a lot of the moisture will drain off before you even cook it. This is what I do whenever I want a firmer tofu. You can also put something on top to weigh it down.",

It is amazing made just as listed, but I have tweaked it to suit my own needs.  I use shredded sweet potato hash browns, instead of the potato, and I omit the tomatoes and add chopped zucchini and mushrooms.  I sometimes add chopped red bell pepper as well. The spices really make this dish. Thanks so much for sharing!",
