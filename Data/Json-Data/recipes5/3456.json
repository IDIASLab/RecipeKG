I pounded my chicken breasts first because they were kind of thick and had to increase the initial cooking time to 20-25 minutes because at 10 minutes, it was still very raw.  My picky daughter liked the chicken but without the nuts. She just doesn't like nutes period. Served over brown rice and with a granny smith apple/spinach/candied pecan salad. Again, very, very good. I love this site and everything I have prepared has received countless compliments.",

The reason why I am going with 4 is that the cook time for the chicken seems a little short unless you pound the chicken breasts thin. I added more time to my cook time. In addition, next time I think I will try the cornstarch to thicken the sauce, I just don't want to change the taste of the sauce, it is excellent with chicken and rice. I also enjoy the flavor of the pecans! Thanks for a good recipe Brian!",
