This didn't call for the pumpkin pie mix either but figured it would be fine because it was something sweet. I used 1/2 the fat ice cream and low fat evaporated milk. I subtituted the cinnamon for an equal amount of pumpkin pie spice to get more of that pumpkin pie flavor. After I blended it I thought this tasted okay but it was almost room temperature and only slightly thicker than milk. I then decided to add ice cubes like I do to every smoothie recipe on here. I added 8 ice cubes and it completely transformed it. It stretched the servings and it tasted like a pumpkin pie ice cream shake. \"The ice is a must!\" I don't think of ice cream in the fall but it was still tasty.",
