If you're able to wrestle it all together on the table, verses mixing into a dough ball in the bowl, you'll be rewarded with a much tenderer scone. But even a slightly tough one, painted with a fruity fresh strawberry glaze, will be a winner at any special-occasion brunch or teatime.",

Buttery and crumbly, these will pair well with a cup of Earl Grey. Instead of the strawberry glaze (because my strawberries had sadly dried out) I made a lemon glaze for a stronger overall lemon flavor. I will try the strawberry glaze next time, which won't be very long from now since my boyfriend and I ate them all in about two days during this quarantine.",
