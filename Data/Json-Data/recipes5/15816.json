In fact I found this recipe while searching by ingredients because I lost the recipe my friend gave me. It's not gourmet by any stretch and I usually avoid processed foods like canned soup but this is good easy comfort food for a crowd. Just don't expect it to taste like Mexican enchiladas; different thing altogether. The only thing my friend does differently is mixing in some of the sauce with the ground beef filling & adding a little cheese on the inside as well. I add jalepenos but that's my thing. I think you'll like it if you try it.",
