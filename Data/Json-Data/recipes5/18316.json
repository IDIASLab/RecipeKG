I didn't have soy milk or heavy cream so I twisted the recipe a little putting ricotta cheese and cottage cheese instead and also didn't have cashews so I just added peanuts. in addition I made the mistake of pouring the cheese mix before the breadcrumb mixture so I added another layer of the cheese mix....very tasty.. Baked it for 45 mins instead. I recommend it!",
