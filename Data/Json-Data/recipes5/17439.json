There shouldn't be NEAR that amount of wine for the sauce--more like a couple of tablespoons.  The base of the sauce shouldn't be wine, but instead chicken broth, water, or even apple juice.  The roll-ups themselves are very tasty--the brown sugar added great flavor.  To continue this flavor through the meal, I made it with mashed sweet potatoes with brown sugar.",

Be sure to add the flour first to the sauce and let it brown to a roux then add your liquids. Add them slowly and whisk to desired consistency. I probably added about 1 1/2 cups wine to the sauce but did it slowly to let it blend and thicken. I simply slit the chicken breast and secured the cheese wrapped in ham inside. Also don't leave off the brown sugar! I adds a nice hint of sweetness that balances with the sauce. Thank you! I would make this again!",
