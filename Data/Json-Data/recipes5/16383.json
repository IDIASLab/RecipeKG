She used vanilla instead of maple extract. Then she topped them with a chocolate rosebud. I surprised him by making the same cake recipe and icing them with this icing. When he saw the cupcakes he had tears in his eyes and gave me a huge hug. Then he devoured lots of them in a short sitting and for days after!:) I found it was easier to just dip the cupcakes in the icing as opposed to spreading it on- it gave the cupcakes a smooth look. This tastes silky and soft and like caramel. It's just so delicious I see why it was a favorite of my hubby's family. Highly recommended over chocolate cake- the flavors were meant for each other!",
