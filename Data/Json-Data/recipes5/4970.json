Another change was that I eliminated the oil in the salad but kept it in the dressing.  And I substituted olive oil for the canola.  Lastly, we squeezed fresh lime over our individual servings, which brightened up the taste.  One other note, the small red onion I used was extremely strong so I should have reduced that amount as the onion flavor overwhelmed the left overs.  It is also a very beautiful salad, especially striking in a dark colored dish.  It was served with poached salmon on the side.",

We are your \"average cooks\" who are not in search of vegetarian vegan blah blah special recipe meals. Just wanted something fresh that included barley. I agree with the other reviewers that it tastes the BEST the next day. I have so many plans to tweak this recipe for more fun and delicious options. It has a beautiful presentation and will be my go-to for family gatherings and to bring to friends. Loved the original recipe and that is why it earned five stars from me.",
