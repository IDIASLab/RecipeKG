I don't eat wheat so no pita for me. I tried tortilla chips no they don't work w/ this. I think it makes a good salad dressing if you like sweet & creamy which I do not. I think I will just eat it with a spoon. I will probably not make it again. The system would not let me post a photo. I ended up giving it to my neighbor Carolyn.",
