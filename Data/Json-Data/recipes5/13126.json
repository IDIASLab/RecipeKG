        "description": "The first time I tried this chili I was floored! It has wonderful flavors, and is very spicy and very addictive. If you don't like heat, adjust the ingredients. It's perfect at a football tailgate party or picnic. If you like a roasted flavor, bake the garlic before pressing it. For the beer, a hoppy pale ale works well, as does a dark stout. I've also experimented with adding a cup of coffee to the mix to give it a roasted coffee flavor. It also freezes well.",

I added one extra bell pepper I used lean ground beef and I used only one half of a can of the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I also added at least quadruple the amount of chili powder and oregano I didn't use a whole tablespoon of black pepper (I just added it when needed like when I was browning the meat and sauteing the vegetables) and I added two heaping teaspoons of cumin. This absolutely filled my largest soup pot to the brim so I split into two large crockpots to have it cook evenly and to save on power. After an hour it's awesome. It has a serious bite to it from the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce I'm really glad I asked for advice before I threw in the whole can. (And it was a small can too!) I will recommend that you puree your chipotle peppers in with some of the tomato sauce so you get an even consistancy and don't have chunks of hot. Killer chili.",
