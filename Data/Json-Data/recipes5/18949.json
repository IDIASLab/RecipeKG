I didn't grill, but instead baked covered at 400 degrees for 10 minutes or until fork flaky and cooked all the way through. I did use the marinade for a reduction sauce (served under the salmon on the plate). I placed the marinade in a sauce pan for about 15 minutes, adding a bit of white wine to enhance the flavor.  A huge hit with the entire family!!",

My butcher gave me 8 oz. filets instead of the 4 oz. ones I asked for, but I'm certainly not complaining! I made enough marinade for four filets, poured half over my salmon and reserved the rest to drizzle over some exotic mixed greens. A former co-worker I sometimes see on my daily commute to work told me about this recipe and how delicious the marinade was. She suggested serving it as a dressing, hence the idea. Try it! Served with potatoes in chili butter (Green Giant brand, located in your grocer's produce section), this was one seriously SLAMMIN' meal. My hubs and I don't generally share the same culinary point of view, but we couldn't agree more when it comes to this meal - it's light, healthy, delicious and 100% worthy of a repeat at our house (and a permanent spot in our menu rotation). Thanks for sharing, Aytom! :-)",
