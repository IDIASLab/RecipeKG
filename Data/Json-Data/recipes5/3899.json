But it still turned out great and was very spicy! Like many of the other reviews I needed to add more liquid so I switched off water & EVOO until I got the right consistency. I also felt it needed more cumin so I added (roughly) another 1/2 tsp. The first time I ever had hummus was in Jerusalem so I guess I'm kind of a hummus snob. Store bought just dosen't cut it! This recipe was a great spicy version!",

I found the proportions to be way off but maybe it's just a recipe that creates a chunkier hummus whereas I prefer the smoother variety. I used the food processor to ensure a smooth texture and found I had to add probably a 1/2 cup more olive oil than called for. I also needed to add plenty of salt. I was freaked out by the amount of cayenne called for so I only put in 1/2 tsp. Good thing because my lips are still burning from the little bit I just ate. Overall a decent base recipe but required many tweaks.",
