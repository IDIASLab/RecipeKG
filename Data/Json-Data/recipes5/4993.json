The only changes I made were to omit the olives and substitute green beans for asparagus. I especially loved the toasted pine nuts in it. My dad told me how to roast a red pepper: cut it into flat pieces and put them skin side up under the broiler until they turn black then peel the black skin off. It turned out great. I might actually put in more veggies next time.",
