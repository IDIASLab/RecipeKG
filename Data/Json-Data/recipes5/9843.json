Next time I'll skip the zest and add fresh lemon to the salmon instead (I love zest but it stood out a little too much; I prefer the herbs to pop) This is perfect for brunch and once you get the assembly line going so fast to put together!",

Baked the salmon separately with roasted garlic and olive oil, and then minced it with a fork and stuffed the shells. Topped it with the microgreens (I used leek instead of watercress).\nWish I could share a picture cause they came out cute as a button, but apparently my phone shoots in too high a resolution. \nFlavor is intensely delicious!!!",
