Once your 4 minute cooking time is up the Instant Pot automatically converts to the keep warm mode so you don t need to make another selection. This did take about 25 minutes for the liquid to cook down to a creamy mac and cheese consistency. My only recommendation would be to use a good-quality cheddar cheese (I like extra sharp) as it will make a huge difference in taste. Thank you Michael Beatty for sharing your recipe.",

The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly. Very good! The second time I made it which was for Thanksgiving dinner I added about a cup or so of cubed Velveeta cheese. Because... you know... Velveeta!! It was outstanding! Rave reviews all around. And the ingredients are all something you probably have in your fridge (or freezer - I load up on the packs of shredded cheese when they re on sale and store them in the freeze). Less than 30 minutes start to finish!",
