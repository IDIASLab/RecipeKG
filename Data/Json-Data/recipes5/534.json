                "reviewBody": "Thank you for this excellent recipe Kimberly V.! This made my family look forward to supper time with the smells coming from the kitchen! Because the ingredient list is short and it's all about fresh spices. This is worth making sure your cumin/coriander/turmeric are under a year old. Also if basmati rice is available in your area it's worth the extra expense. This is great food for a party: Can be made ahead of time communal doubles or triples easily and everyone can add sides to their liking. I'll put in a good word for raita mango chutney and achar. When making this again I would use a large slow-cooker: Carmelizing the aromatics and browning the meat the night before setting it on low for at least 6 hours then cranking it to high with diced potatoes and serving when tender.",
