If anyone in your group is not I probably would not make prepare this as the blue cheese is extremely prominent in the flavor profile. Recommendations to improve this recipe (while staying true to the mega-blue cheese flavor\" is as follows. Prepare exactly as in recipe but add this. In a pan with a pat of butter toast until golden brown 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs. Cool bread crumbs then add to meat/cheese mixture. Also add one egg white to meat/cheese/bread mixture as binder. This recipe would also be excellent with Parmesan Regianno substituting for blue cheese.",
