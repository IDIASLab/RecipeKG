Next time I would leave the water out, as there is no need for it and it leaves the eggs kind of wet at the end.  I also thought letting the eggs set for 3 mins, then cooking for an additional 2 to 5 minutes was way too long. You could just add the eggs and spices and scramble for 2 minutes, no need to let them 'set'. I had to add a sprinkle of salt at the end to bring out the flavors, otherwise it was a little bland. I would make this again, but would cut back to 1/2 an onion.",
