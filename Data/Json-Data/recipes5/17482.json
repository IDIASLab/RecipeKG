I followed one reviewer's suggestion of substituting the 1 1/4 cup brown sugar for 1 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar and then used a full cup of peanut butter and real butter instead of shortening.  I also baked the cookies at 350 like most people suggested for about 10 minutes.  I only made about 12 cookies from the batch (I like them pretty big) and I flattened the balls of dough out and pressed them with a fork before I baked them.  They are undoubtedly the best PB cookies I've ever had.  I'm making another batch tonight to share with my family!  Follow the substitutions and I GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed!!",

I replaced the shortening with a 1/2 cup of butter and also increased the peanut butter to 1 full cup.
