Little did I know that it wasn't really goulash, but an Americanized version, invented to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food for a not-so-small family. This is one of those very simple dishes that does not taste simple--perfect for your weeknight dinner rotation.",

This didn't disappoint!  There is a certain nuanced flavor to this dish, that was even more pronounced on day two.  Kids and adults LOVED this.  Made the recipe as is, perhaps with a touch less soy sauce.  I think the only change I would make for the future would be to use the entire box of elbows instead of two cups, which might enhance the meat to pasta ratio.

I was skeptical about adding so much paprika when I first read the recipe but I trust Chef John after making many of his recipes. Only thing I changed was diced and sauted a green bell pepper along with the onion.  I ended up using 1 cup of elbow macaroni and a cup of large seashell macaroni as that is what I had on hand.  I also used mild yellow cheddar instead of the white cheddar. These weren't changes that really altered the recipe's taste.  It was easy to make and a definite keeper.  Nice comfort food on a cold evening...and adding some garlic toast to eat with it was a nice complement.",
