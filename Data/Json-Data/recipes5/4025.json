When combining ingredients together-turn temp to medium-high heat, and use a whisk. Add egg yolks slowly (whisking the entire time you add them). Then, bring heat down to medium heat and begin whisking constantly for about 5-7 minutes or until thick and bubbly 4.) Gently fold in butter, vanilla and roasted coconut.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes.  Wrap with plastic wrap (Custard sometimes has a top layer of film on it & plastic wrap will easily lift it)  Let it cool for at least 3 hrs. Then top w/ whipped cream , 1/2 cup of additional roasted coconut & bananas.",

I made my own graham pie crust which is definately the way to go. The toasted coconut complimented the banana very nicely and I LOVE coconut. My only complaint and the reason why I did not give it five stars is because the condensed milk was not my favorite so I will probably look for a different sauce base the next time I make it. However great overall.",

I even got a letter from someone saying it was the best pie they ever had! But I thought that the pudding mixture could have more coconut flavor so I added alittle more than a tablespoon of light coconut milk which added loads more of coconut flavor! If you don't have (light) cocnut milk, just add coconut extract instead! Maybe just a little more banana flavor, but still amazing!",
