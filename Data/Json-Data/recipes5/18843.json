For the ground beef, I had some leftover hot dog sauce (Grandpa' Classic Coney Dog Sauce recipe) that I used.  I've made many baked beans recipes and my guests and I really liked the flavors this dish had.  It's almost a meal by itself.  I had always cooked my beans in the oven for at least an hour prior to this recipe.  I really liked the ease of putting all the ingredients into the crockpot and letting cook on high for 2 hours.  Next time, I will add the water as needed after stirring occasionally for a thicker sauce.  Can't wait to make these again for our next big BBQ bash!",
