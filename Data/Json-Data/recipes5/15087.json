My tomato paste didn't look like the one in the movie when it was cooking, maybe I didn't put as much as Chef John did or perhaps my onion amount as larger. In any case, I struggled to watch it turn to that red brick color as it was cooking. Nonetheless, the final product came out fabulous. I ground my own cumin in a mortar and pestle because I find the flavor is way bolder than with the store bought stuff. Will definitely make it again, a nice change from the brown/green lentil recipes I have made in the past",

I simmered for 15 minutes partially covered, -- shut off heat and just covered it to finish softening lentils.  Or, you can add more stock. Grateful I had all ingredients. I get a lot of mint during summer -- I clip, rinse and freeze in vac paks to have on hand. Red lentils are great because they have none or less skin hence they do cook quicker.",
