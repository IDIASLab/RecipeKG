I made the mistake of boiling the squid with a red onion and it turned the calamari a naff colour. Still tastes great! Best served along other cold salads and starters... Capanata crunchy bread an interesting green salad french bread olive oil. I halved the oil in the recipe and it is still great.",

Added garlic shallots & 1/4 C EVOO to simmering & used a single cube of Knorr shrimp bouillon rather than pure salt. Yes these are significant changes however it was so tasty when I tasted the simmering broth I wanted to preserve that flavor rather than introduce the lemon notes. Will make again!!
