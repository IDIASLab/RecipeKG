The cake was done, (no batter) but it was very moiste. Since the cake was just for family, I managed to unite the two halves.  The cake tasted okay.  I don't think the jam was necessary.  I did not add the frosting.  So either frosting or jam.  Both are too much.  I made the frosting but did not use it.",
