The shrinp would be swimming in butter (pun intended) if you used as much as directed.  Moreover, since the main ingredient in Old Bay is celery salt, I would strongly advise not using the full amount.  I used a little better than half the spice mixture called for and it was terribly salty. I'm glad I sprinkled it on the shrimp rather than adding it to the sauce so that I could get a better idea of just how much seasoning was being used.  This unquestionably was a great blend of herbs and spices (tho' I did omit the red pepper flakes in consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards) and the bacon, of course, made its own, wonderful and unique flavor contribution.  Back off on both the butter and the Old Bay (at least START with less anyway, and see what you think) and this is a solid four star dish.",

I was only feeding two of us so I played with the quantities a bit, cutting the shrimp, bacon and butter to 1/3 and eyeballing the other ingredients.  I really wasn't sure about the mustard, but I used everything and it is wonderful.  You can taste each layer of flavor but nothing over takes the others.  I cooked the bacon and herbs in a cast iron skillet so instead of transferring it to a baking dish, I just made sure each shrimp was well coated and put the whole thing in the preheated oven.  It smelled so enticing!  I served it over whole wheat farfalle, but next time I think I will serve it over crusty French bread.  The sauce is too good to leave any uneaten.  Thanks Valorie, this is a winner in my book.",

Perfectly seasoned (with unsalted butter) I had a package of real bacon bits I wanted to use up so I quickly crisped them (there was no bacon fat to speak of)and then followed the recipe. I added some simple crab stuffed pepperdews and some whole hearts of palm to the pan. I broiled for the last few minutes and served with lots of warm French bread to soak up the butter sauce.
