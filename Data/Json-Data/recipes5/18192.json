I made it exactly as written except I did not need the last cup of flour in the recipe and instead of rolling it out I just shaped the loaves in the pan into rectangles that fit the pans.  Here's a tip: do not over rise for the second rising. If you let it rise for too long (more than 35 mins. or so) it will over rise and then deflate if you try to move it to the oven and it will be flat like mine!",

                "reviewBody": "Very good bread!  It is definitely kid friendly, because within minutes of taking this out of the oven, the smell got their attention and almost an entire loaf was gone within ten minutes.  I did do a few things different, but not so much to change the recipe, per se. I always use King Arthur flour or home-grinded.  In this case, I used KA flour, as it is far superior to all other brands, imo.  Used coconut oil for the vegetable oil; Rapunzel sugar instead of brown sugar; Himalayan salt; and raw milk.  The end results were delicious!  Oh yes, only used three cups plus 2 TBSP. of the whole wheat flour.  It's easy to know when you have added enough flour, if you're using a stand mixer with a dough hook.  The dough will come together and completely come away from the sides of the bowl.  It'll also come away from the dough hook (not be sticky to it) where the dough hook is only kneeding it.  If kneeding by hand, same thing, except with your hands, it won't be sticky to your hands anymore and will come away from them. Just a tip for anyone new to bread making.  :)  Do a search on bread making and you'll find all sorts of tricks of the trade!  Bread making is so much fun!",

Shaped loaves (you don't need to roll out just shape into a rectangle and plop in buttered pan) and baked as directed. I really enjoyed the end result and this really is kid (baby) friendly as many wheat bread recipes contain honey and children under 1 year are not supposed to eat honey.

                "reviewBody": "The double loaf worked well in my kitchenaid. I used almost all of the flour. I rolled and tucked one and shaped the other into a loaf. The rolled and tucked one was much nicer and didn't stick to my pan but had huge holes in the loaf even though I rolled it tightly. I googled how to make french bread and the technique worked on this for rolling and tucking. It's more like fold and pound. This time there were no holes and it was great.. gone in 30 minutes. Also need to remember 15 minutes at 400 and 30 at 350 or even less time if I don't want to burn this! Thanks!!:)",
