I used garam masala (cardamom cloves cinamon cumin seeds corriander seeds toasted and ground) extra curry more black pepper and chopped cilantro in the pan not only for garnish. I chopped up a few fresh very hot cayenne peppers too. (Too many to use up this summer!!) I used 1/3 can of diced tomatoes and a few small fresh plum tomatoes to get a nice sauce rather than only ketchup (I omitted) and water. At the end I stirred in about 1/3c low fat plain yogurt. I served with jasmine rice. Delish. No way would the recipe as written have enough spice and flavor. I noticed a lot of recipes on here are very base and simple and someone who knows there way around the kitchen can really jack them up to awesome!",

Also added a healthy dose of chopped up habanero as we do serious spice in our house. The extra water is definitely needed to give it a good stewey sauce for the rice and I even added a can of diced tomatoes although I think that ended up making it too tomatoey and not enough curry.",
