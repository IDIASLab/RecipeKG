I didn't measure how much basil I added.  Thanks for the great vegan pesto recipe, NJChick!",

Any previous pesto I've made just seemed to turn out poorly. This one is great and I swear for once the nutritional yeast actually makes me think of cheese (which I so love and miss)! My modifications were as follows: I used pecans because it was what I had on hand I did add a dash of salt and pepper my herbs were from the garden and I threw in a little oregano thyme and lemongrass (since it called for lemon anyway). I was definitely heaviest on the basil though. Finally I added the oil very slowly because my biggest problem with previous pesto attempts has been too much oil for too few herbs. A \"bunch\" is hard to define so I just went slow and...voila - a great pesto! I probably only used 3 tablespoons of oil so definitely not a half cup but I know everyone likes their pesto to slightly different consistencies. Thanks so much for this recipe. It will definitely be my go-to pesto from now on.",
