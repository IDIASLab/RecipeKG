I sauteed seasoned chicken tenderloins in coconut oil.\nI served it over baked spaghetti squash with a little shredded parmesan on top. Both my husband and I found the sauce to be too lemony and/or tart.  However, it was a good base. I will make it again, but next time I will probably cut the lemon in half, decrease the capers and add some butter (which perhaps I was missing because I didn't cook the chicken in butter).\nThanks for sharing this.",

Made a few tweaks though to perfect it... when coating the chicken I scrambled up to eggs to soak them in first then placed them moist chicken in a Ziploc bag with the flour, added 1/2 cup Parmesan, 2 tbsp of seasoned salt, and a cup of panko bread crumbs. Once the chicken was done and set aside, I let some mushrooms saut\u00e9 right before adding in the rest of the sauce ingredients. To the sauce I added 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream, a touch of the liquid from the caper jar, and a dash of corn starch to thicken it up a bit..... Turned out AMAZIINNGGGGg!!! Thanks for the great recipe!!",
