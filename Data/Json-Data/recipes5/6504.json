It's one of the few dishes where I use lemon juice but not the zest. I'm not really going for the lemon flavor as much as the tartness. In fact, you could use rice vinegar instead if that's what you've got.",

I added 1/2 c. water and 1 tsp fresh grated ginger to the sauce so there would be enough to coat the tofu. I thickened up the sauce a bit with 1 tsp corn starch dissolved in 1 Tbsp water.
