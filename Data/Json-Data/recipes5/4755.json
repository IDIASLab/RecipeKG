I had to tweak the ingredients a bit due to not having everything available, but still turned out delicious! Fiance went back for seconds, so it was a sure hit.  For my version, I used ground ginger instead of fresh (maybe 1/8 tsp or so) and put it in with the rest of the spices right before simmering. I used dried cilantro flakes instead of fresh. I increased the curry to 1 1/2 Tbsp since we like the curry flavor. I couldn't find any plain yogurt, so I used a mixture of 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup coconut milk (with a bit of sugar added). I also used 1/2 cup coconut milk instead of water. For the garam masala I used the 'Easy Garam Masala' recipe found at this website. It makes enough for multiple batches of curry. I also added two potatoes cut into bite-size pieces. This increased the cooking time by about 20-30 minutes, although next time I will add the potato in with the onion to save time. Next time I would also like to try some mushrooms in the curry.  Overall a great recipe, and would make it again and again! Next time will be with shrimp. 5 stars.",

                "reviewBody": "Very very good and authentic tasting. I put everything, except the lemon and yogurt, in the slow cooker on high for about 4 hours. I even threw the chicken in there frozen! After the first 4 hours, I added the yogurt and cooked about another hour. I forgot to add the lemon juice, but next time would do so just before serving.  I used greek yogurt and did not add water or use oil but used twice the amount of crushed tomatoes. I also used only 1 teaspoon of salt, which was plenty. I think the slow cooker method made it very flavorful, moist, healthier and easy.",
