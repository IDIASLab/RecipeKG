Just decrease the cooking time of the crust a little. Also increase the milk to 4 cups use 12 oz Cool Whip over pudding layer and drizzle on a glaze of: 2 T butter melted with 1/3 cup chocolate chips add 1 C powdered sugar and 2 T hot water. Then top with chopped toasted pecans and serve chilled -- not frozen. My family loves this recipe!",

I took a hint from someone else and used sugar-free cheesecake pudding. I thought the flavor needed a little punch so I added a few drops of vanilla and almond extracts. Topped it with Cool Whip Lite sugar-free and Lite Hershey's syrup. I also toasted some chopped pecans with a smidge of butter some Splenda Brown Sugar baking blend and some cinnamon. It was a huge success!!! Our fellow diners had no idea it was sugar-free. I'm also going to try is with SF coconut pudding and toasted almonds and toasted coconut on top.",
