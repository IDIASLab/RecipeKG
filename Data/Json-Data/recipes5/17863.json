My 3-year-old who prides himself on eating nothing ever, LOVED these. I've tried every breakfast known to man to get him to eat. I was skeptical of this recipe, but out of desperation gave it a try. It just proves the old addage, \"don't knock it, til you try it.\" My son ate 2 1/2 of these. My 6-year-old ate all of hers, and I had one too. We all loved it! My son called his dad at work, and told him he would make him one this weekend. I think this will be a great back-to-school breakfast too! I guess you can tell, our family gives this recipe a 5-star rating! Thanks again for sharing!",

It's that delicious!!! I tried it with both apples and bananas. I liked the crunchy peanut butter with the bananas and the creamy peanut butter with the apples. The only advice I have is make sure your muffins are really toasted. I think it needs the firmness to hold up the peanut butter and fruit.
