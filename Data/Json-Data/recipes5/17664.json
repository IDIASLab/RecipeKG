The only changes I made were using pineapple juice concentrate instead of juice (intensifies the flavor) and I added more garlic and fresh chopped ginger to the marinade. Holy these were good!!! We are both serious carnivores and I would be proud to serve these at any celebration. Thank you so much!!!",

I didn't grill the ribs because I thought they would be too tough (plus it's COLD outside). I rested them on a bed of onions covered them with the sauce and cooked them in the oven 30 minutes on 400 and 30 minutes on 325. Tender and nummy. Not sure if ribs is the best choice for this sauce. Looking forward to using it on chicken breasts and cooking them on the grill. Thank you for a great tasty marinade recipe.",

I lost track). the meat was tender but it was not falling off the bone. I think I'll try this marinade with a different cut of pork... maybe chops or a loin. Very Very Good!",
