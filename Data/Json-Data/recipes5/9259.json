                "reviewBody": "There were some  issues with this recipe from the beginning. When it said to spray an 8-inch baking dish, I realized that there were too many ingredients in the recipe for such a small dish. I used an 11 x 7 inch baking dish, and even that was too small. I should have used my 9 X 13 inch baking dish. The second major fault in this recipe is that the zucchini should have been pre-cooked. The whole dish was full of liquid even after baking for 90 minutes, it overflowed while baking, and what a mess in the oven! I'm sure the liquid came out of the raw zucchinis. I used three small zucchinis rather than 1 1/2 large ones, and I used Italian-seasoned ground turkey instead of ground beef. I had fresh basil, so I added some of that and dried Italian seasoning to the sauce. As I typed this review I just noticed another issue . The \"Cook\" information  under the recipe title says to cook the lasagna for 60 minutes. In direction #6 of the recipe it says \"Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until golden, about 15 minutes more.\" Mine baked for an hour before I removed the aluminum foil, and even after 30 more minutes, the cheese on the top had melted, but never became golden. In spite of all the issues, the lasagna tasted great. I will use this recipe again, with the changes I noted, especially pre-cooking the  zucchini slices. Some other recipes recommend roasting them in the oven. I will try that next time.",

Other than that this was a very tasty dish and I would make it again.",

Also, did 15 ounces of ricotta, two eggs and Parmesan for that yummy, creamy layer. And rather than jarred sauce I made my own - olive oil  in a heated pan, salt, red pepper flakes, 3-4 cloves garlic (saut\u00e9 for just a minute) then add a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes and simmer. Add the beef/sausage mixture to the sauce and a handful of chopped parsley. Be sure to use a mandolin to slice the zucchini about 3/8\u201d think. Layer it up, bake and enjoy!",
