Warning: the cookies get gooey and flat if there's not enough chunky stuff inside. I used chopped pecans and chocolate chips. Also I took the other reviewer's advice and set my oven to 350. They're done before they look done I took them out when the edges were getting brown. Liberally grease your pan a light coating won't do the trick. Not a pretty cookie but very very yummy and economical!",
