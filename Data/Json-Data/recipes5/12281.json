Less pepper was the big one, maybe personal taste but that's a lot of pepper for any dish and thankful I cut it back.  I also didn't put the full amount of garlic in because we wanted to taste the other flavors and was afraid it would over power the dish.  With those changes it was a big hit here and the kids asked for it again.  It made a ton and was very rich.",
