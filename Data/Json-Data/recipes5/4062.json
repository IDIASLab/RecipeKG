It is creamy and full of flavor and should be served over some kind of carb (rice, potatoes, naan) to absorb and dissimulate the spice.  It can be easily done in a vegetarian version by substituting the chicken with potatoes, broccoli, spinach and/or paneer.  I garnish it with cilantro leaves and grated cheese.",

I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of one and 1/2 cup of cream instead of 1/4 cup. I put 1/2 tsp of salt in the marinade but as it cooked I had to keep on tasting and adding salt. I also add 1/4 tsp of sugar in the marinade. I used black pepper instead of white pepper. Lastly I marinated it for about 16 hours and it really worked. I think though 1.5 pounds of chicken for 6 serving is too little. Oh I also added some carrots and green pepper in it. I served with rice on the side. I highly recommend this recipe for those who crave for spice.",
