I was desparate to play with some dough in my dorm and have some breakfast food in my room for when I dash out the door in the morning. I was running low on my baking supplies and didn't have any yeast so I was very excited to have found a recipe without much preparation time needed. I mixed up some glaze to put on top-oh how they melted in my mouth! I got a lot of dirty looks when I told others I wasn't sharing (I ended up sharing anyway-grrrr) and now I have only four left. I am going to make these all the time now! talk about giving me a good reason to wake up in the morning! The only modification I made was I mixed the filling together and THEN spread it on the dough-I made a little more filling than called for and poured the extra on the bottom of the baking pan before I placed the rolls in it. This makes them nice and gooy on the one side.",

I can also see where one would need to frost with a cream cheese or powdered sugar glaze. Though the instructions say to bake for 15-20 minutes mine were overbaked at 14. Fresh from the oven these have a wonderful taste but after they sit for an hour or so they taste like a b.p. biscuit with a little cinnamon sugar. Pretty dry for my gang. Thanks anyway monstermama.",
