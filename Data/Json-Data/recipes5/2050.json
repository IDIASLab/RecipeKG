I couldn't find the Swiss chocolate cake so I ended up using Devil's Food. I realized when I was making it that my cake mix was 16 oz and not the 18.25 called for. I wasn't sure what would happen since it was a smaller box so I cut the chocolate milk down to 1 cup. It worked nicely. When I was making this my hubby and my boys were thinking it was going to be weird since you pour all the milks over the cake, but they all loved it. When I went to make the frosting I realized I only had 1 1/2 cups of cream so I had to cut the frosting in half :( Still really good. Hubby even went back for another piece later in the night, which isn't something he does with cake. Fantastic recipe! Thanks MrsFisher0729 :)",

I make tres leches quite a bit and I wanted to try something a bit different. I couldn't find an 18 oz. box of ANY cake mix, so I went with a 16.5 oz. box of a fudge cake. I left all other ingredients the same. The cake came out good and the icing came out good. The ONLY thing that I will change for next time is the amount of liquid I pour over the cake. Normally, I put more, but I wanted to follow the recipe at least the first time. So, I did and my husband and I both agree that it definitely needed more liquid. Tres leches, typically, are not that dry. They are supposed to be a pretty wet cake. So, all I got was a moist cake, not a tres leches. Overall, a pretty good recipe. I will just need to adjust the amount of liquid.",
