I loved the ingredients that went into this stew, loved making it, and Hubs and I certainly loved eating it! As all cooks should do, I seasoned this \"to taste,\" upping the cumin to probably a couple of teaspoons, substituting Mexican oregano for the marjoram (have never used it!), backing off on the pepper to probably a teaspoon (you can always add it but you can't take it back out!) and subbing two, fresh poblano peppers for the canned green chilies - first, because I love 'em and second, because they're easier on Hubs' sensitive innards.  Wanting to make sure the meat was good and tender, I simmered this for a good hour and a half - and it WAS buttery tender.  This is intensely aromatic as it cooks, letting you know that what you're in for will be well worth the wait! I served this over plain white rice, with a dollop of sour cream, but I could easily see this wrapped in a tortilla too (that will be coming up with the leftovers!)",

This is definitely a keeper recipe.... Thanks so much for submitting!!",

I used 2lbs of pork instead of 3, chicken broth instead of water, and oregano instead of marjoram, since that's what I had on hand, didn't change the rest of the amounts called for, and the recipe came out a tiny bit tart, but the supporting flavors were perfect. The tartness is due to the tomatillos I'm sure, which I'm not used to cooking with. Still, so delicious! I will definitely make this again. I used 2 tsp cumin, and since I had a 4oz can of diced green chiles, I left a little bit of seeds in when I diced up the jalapenos. I served this on top of rice, with tortillas on the side and our leftovers will be burritos. So good! Thank you for a wonderful recipe. **Update: I made this with 2 cans of diced tomatoes, drained (instead of tomatillos) and it was delicious! Highly recommended!",
