Also the baking time of 15-20 minutes seemed a little excessive. If the cookies are made the size of a golf ball and baked 20 minutes they were too overdone for our tastes. We baked at 325 in a convection oven in our bakery for 12 minutes. They were moist at this temperature and time. The flavor was good with the addition of the candy oil.",
