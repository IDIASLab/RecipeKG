Since I usually do not like too much of a sweet taste I reduced the molasses and honey by half and added slightly less than 1/4 cup brown sugar. Per another reviewer's suggestion I used only a 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke. I assembled all the ingredients in 2 cup measure (except peppers and garlic) first. After mincing the garlic into the processor I used disposable gloves for cutting up the hot peppers. I may have to start growing these peppers. I plan to try this sauce for chickpeas and chopped onions. For a chunky salsa I plan to try mixing it with chopped peaches and onion.",
