The trick is to use a demi-glace of the same style -- i.e., a venison demi if using deer. You can 'fake' a demi-glace by reducing an appropriate brown stock and adding a water and flour slurry to thicken. Makes an awesome romantic dinner for two.",

Another reviewer is confused over the term \"scallopini\", which refers to the thin slices of meat used in the picatta recipe.  Once you have dredged the scallopini in seasoned flour, dip it in an egg/Parmesan cheese wash before turning it into your hot skillet.  Just brown the scallopini, don't fully cook, as you can return it for one last cook/ warm up at the end (careful not to overcook the chicken!).  If you do not have fresh chicken stock for Demi-glacing the pan, use any liquid canned chicken broth.  Reduce the broth with the lemon juice, butter, olive oil, garlic, and white wine to concentrate the flavors.  Add some fresh thyme and fresh chopped parsley to taste now (no stems).  When ready, return your scallopinis to the skillet for a final warm-up and add capers to taste.  I like lots.  Try this recipe with veal or sliced beef tenderloin also",

The demi-glace made it even better - richer, with a more full-bodied flavor.  An excellent,  solid 5-star recipe. I would just caution against cooking the chicken for 6-8 minutes on each side.  A few minutes on each side, just until the chicken turns opaque, is all this needs. Even a minute or two of overcooking can easily take this from moist and tender to tough and dry.",

Dredge them in flour seasonsed w/s&p sauteed them until golden brown and keep warm in the oven while I sautee (canned or fresh) mushrooms a bit of lemon juice white wine if I have it (stock or water w/chicken bullion granuales also works) and usually a bit of flour mixed into the liquid before adding to the pan.
