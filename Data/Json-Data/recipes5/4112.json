I don't think I'll be making it again, but if I do I would probably omit the honey and paprika.  The honey added a nice flavor but it wound up being too sweet and the paprika really didn't add anything that the other spices hadn't already given to the recipe.  Actual cooking time was also wound up being much less than recommended.  I might also consider adding the vegetables half way through the cooking process because they wound up being rather overcooked. ",

Anyway it tasted great and we are putting on our A-list of dishes to serve even for the most demanding company.",

I used turnips and cut them in 1/4 inch slices since they're only 2\" in diameter to begin with - I wonder if the cook meant parsnips? I served this with couscous but it didn't soak up the juice like I'd want. I think it would be better paired with something bland - mashed potatoes? I also served with steamed spinach - delicious!",
