It is a white cake topped with vanilla crumbs and filled with rich lemon cream. After a few attempts, this is the version that I like best. It uses a white cake mix to cut preparation time.

I wanted to like this more than I did, but most of my feelings about it have to do with wanting more lemon flavor (perhaps it isn't supposed to).  Also, it was hard to cut to look good.  It could be that the day I made this we had high humidity and even a few raindrops---unusual for a warm July day in SoCal.  One mistake I made was to use parchment on the bottom of my springform pan---totally unnecessary and burdensome.  I would maybe use half milk and half lemon juice in the cake itself, or at least use lemon flavoring in the cake topping.  Another thought would be to spritz the top of the bottom layer of cake with a simple syrup made with lemon juice and sugar.  I would use a little more lemon zest in the cream layer.  I will try this again on another day!  Thanks, CindyAnn!",

                "reviewBody": "I knew I'd want a more robust lemon flavor after reading the ingredients. I used a yellow cake mix and added a box of lemon pudding to the cake batter. My mother used to add instant pudding to her cakes because it makes them lighter. I also added the juice of one small lemon to the cake. I had about 6 ounces of cream cheese left from a box, so I used it all. So, I added slightly more of he other ingredients for the filling as well (cream and sugar), but the biggest change I made was adding the juice of two small lemons to the filling rather than the small amount it called for.  The cake baked up beautifully, although I have to say that taking part of the mix out to make the topping made it thinner. I think in the future I might use two mixes and 1.5 times the filling. All of the components taste good separately and the lemon is not overpowering in either the cake or the filling. We're excited to try the cake tomorrow.",

I also baked it in a 9 x 13 pan because I was feeding a group of people and needed to be able to serve 18 pieces. I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to slice the 9 x 13 cake in half and reassemble the top layer without it breaking but surprisingly I had no problem at all. The group I made it for really enjoyed the cake and I received requests for the recipe. The second time I followed the directions exactly including using the springform pan. Both times delicious. I'd like to try using 8 oz. of cream cheese next time as I think I want a little more cream cheese flavor in the whipped cream filling.",

I actually made it late one evening when I arrived home after working a 12 hour shift. It was the centerpiece dessert for an Italian night with a group of friends and it was a big hit! \nThe cake looks impressive and people assume you put a lot of time and effort into whipping it up. The truth is with the use of a boxed cake mix as the base it was no more effort than baking a cake and making icing. \nAs far as adding additional lemon zest and juice. I guess if what you're looking for is a LEMON cake, then by all means go ahead. We all thought the cake tasted perfect just the way it is. There is just a nice lemon flavor to the cream. Everyone thought it was the perfect \"light\" ending to a pasta laden meal.\nOne thing I do need to add is that I've never had the restaurant version of this cake nor did I ever have an Italian Nonni serve it up for me. That being said, I'm certain we will be having this exact version of Italian Lemon Cream cake at this house again....and again!",

This was a flat and incredibly sad version of the restaurant cake mentioned. That cake happens to be my very favorite by the way. I tried this just hoping that it would be a cost effective way to enjoy my favorite treat. I should have known better. I think the restaurants cake has lemon in more than just the center it is so flavorful and creamy.",
