I used marinated artichoke hearts (this is VERY important if you want good flavor) and cooked the garlic and onion in a mix of olive oil and some of the marinade from the artichokes. No butter, didn't need it. I added a six ounce can of tomato paste so there was a good amount of sauce and I used a full cup of feta. I added half the feta when the recipe calls for it, then right before serving I sprinkled the other half on top, covered the pan and let the cheese melt a bit. Second time around the recipe was delicious!",

The artichokes really add something special to this dish.\n\nThis recipe is supposed to serve 4, but the three of us all had two helpings, and there was enough leftover for at least two more.\n\nI made a few changes to the recipe, per several other reviews:\n\n1. I used a whole 10 oz container of fresh cherry tomatoes (chopped in half). I don't think anyone else suggested this, but they went very well with this dish. \n\n2. I went just a little bit heavier on the spices. \n\n3. I used about 12 ounces of pasta, which is less than the recipe calls for but still plenty.\n\n4.  I flavored the chicken with salt, pepper and oregano and sauteed it in a mixture of olive oil and butter.  REALLY good!\n\n5. I added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream (per the suggestion of SEVERAL other reviews) right at the end so that the dish didn't turn out too dry.  Delicious!  \n\nJust make sure you have some extra feta cheese to crumble on top at the table.",

It was just OK that night. We had A LOT left over, so we ended up eating it again on Sunday afternoon. I decided to make more sauce as I thought the pasta was a little dry. I used some chicken broth, 2 pats of butter and a splash of heavy cream. I then dumped in the left overs....WOW! Totally great that way. When I make this again, I will make a light cream sauce...it coated the pasta and tasted like it came from an expensive italian restaurant. My daughter and husband (and me!!!) loved it!!!!",

Not as much pasta as called for use olive oil instead of butter and use twice the amount of fetta adding 1/2 when the recipe calls for it and the other 1/2 on top in the serving dish. Next time I will use fresh lemon juice and some lemon zest. I will definately be makeing this time and time again...Rachel",

I also added a bit more marinade as well as about 1/4 cup of pinot grigio when I sauteed the chicken. The chicken pieces had lots of flavor & I am glad I made extra to use in another dish. I cut the pasta in half & then still didn't add all the pasta to the mix. I did do as suggested by reviewers & use a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh & I used a 6 oz. can of marinaded artichoke hearts. I only had a half a cup of feta but I wish I had had some more to sprinkle on top. I served this w/ My Own Famous Stuffed Grape Leaves (from this site) as an appetizer & made Greek Honey Cake (also from this site) for dessert. This was pretty good but I don't think the flavor combos suited my hubby & I...not sure if I'll make it again but thanks for letting me try it!",
