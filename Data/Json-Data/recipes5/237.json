Also even though I tempered the yogurt with 1/4 cup of the liquid from the crock pot when I added it back to the crock pot it curdled some. It was also hard to mix the tempered yogurt to the crock pot and mix it in with the meatballs in the crock pot. I might make the meatballs again.

The sauce was thin at the end of the cook time, so I added milk with a bit of corn starch to thicken....but the bold flavor was lost so I threw in a bit more of steak sauce and veg. beef broth flavor...eventually just dumped sauce and balls (Greek yogurt already tempered into the sauce...) in the pan that I just drained the cooked pasta from...brought that to a good boil to properly thicken.  And then, it was better. Really good flavor but not the best outcome for me in the slow cooker...but probably will do again even if I have to thicken the sauce after work.
