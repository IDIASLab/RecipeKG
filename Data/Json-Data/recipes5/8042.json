What a dressy alternative to just sliced tomatoes! I prepared this with the two mustards just as written and it proved to be a winning combination.  The tang of the mustard and Parmesan was the perfect complement for the mellow mozzarella.  I used fresh rather than dried oregano as I'm lucky enough to have it in my garden.  A quick finish under the broiler browned these up nicely.  This is easy, uses quality ingredients, is pretty on the plate and, most important, is full of delicious flavor too.",

Quick and easy but tastes like you spent a long time. I cut back on the mustards - basically using half of each which gave it just the right amount of pizzaz. After they came out of the oven I sprinkled the tops with fresh basil vs. fresh parsley. Great blend of flavors! This is a definite keeper especially with fresh garden tomatoes over the summer months.",
