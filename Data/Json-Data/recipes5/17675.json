I didn't like the \"streusel\" on top- 1 cup was way too much and it made the top of the cake taste dry and mealy. The cake also bubbled over top of the streusel and toffee chips in several places so the cake wasn't very attractive either. It satisfied my craving for sweets but I don't think I'll use this recipe again.",
