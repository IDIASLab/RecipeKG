My favorite variations (though this original is my go-to as well): Using canola oil instead of butter (since it's at the start I like canola better than olive oil since it seems to fade into the background better). Adding dried herbs with the broth (I like rosemary and thyme or just oregano with the lemon). Adding garlic to or swapping it with the onion. Deglazing with white wine before the broth and in place of the lemon juice. For me any of these makes this dish almost enough for a midday meal (you could even add in shredded or chopped up chicken to really fill it out) and I almost never cook rice any other way (to turn it into a more subtle side dish replace 1/3 to 1/2 the broth with water).",
