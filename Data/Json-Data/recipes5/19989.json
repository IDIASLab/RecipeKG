So I ended up making this on the George Foreman Grill. I marinated the salmon for about 3 hours and the salmon was so tender and flavorful. I set some of the marinade aside and simmered it on the stove for a few minutes then spooned it over top the finished salmon. Delicious! Can't wait to try this on the outdoor grill.",

                "reviewBody": "I've used this technique for years. I made it for the wedding receptions of both my kids, and quickly gained the reputation for making the best Salmon in the West. A couple of tricks: I marinate the fillets in the bottom of a cooler, or in a glass baking dish in the fridge. I sprinkle each fillet with a touch of kosher salt, cover the fillets with brown sugar and drizzle soy sauce on top of the sugar. This draws the natural juices from the Salmon, and turns into a thick dark syrup after a 1/2 hour or so. I let the salmon marinate for several hours. I then quickly rinse the fillets to remove excess sugar and place on the grill flesh side down. This creates the unmistakable grill lines of charbroiled salmon. Watch carefully to not overcook. Check the ends of the fillets. Once you see the salmon has turned opaque about 1/4-1/3 of the way through, slide a couple of spatulas underneath and slide the fillet toward you and flip it away from you. Now that the skin side is down, you can allow it to BBQ as long as you need to until it is done. Once flipped I like to spread a heated mixture of spicy BBQ Sauce (like Cattle Boyz) and butter on top of the flesh as it continues to grill. NOTE: 1) try to grill pieces that are a consistent thickness. Cut thin sections off the fillets and grill them separately. 2) Do not overcook. The flakes should be somewhat translucent in the center. Overcooked salmon will be dry and lose most of its flavour. 3) I do not recommend re-using the marinade!",
