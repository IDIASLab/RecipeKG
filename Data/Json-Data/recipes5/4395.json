After all that I'm not sure if it was just bad quality arugula or if I just can't tell the difference bc it just tasted like spinach to me. I had probably 2 cups total but that was plenty to cover 4 small filets. I used the food processor bc I don't have a blender. Bf said it was \"weird but good\" so we can make it again. Thanks for the recipe and the idea--I think basil or sundried tomato pesto would be awesome on tilapia.",
