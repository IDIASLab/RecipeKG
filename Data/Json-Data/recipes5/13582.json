I made these as directed using multi-colored potatoes. They were all very odd sized so I had to cut the larger ones in quarters in order to get even sized with the smaller ones. Because of this I should have adjusted the time slightly as they were just a little bit over-done. The purple ones LOOK extremely over-done but they weren't it was just because of their dark color. I was surprised at how crispy these were on the outside and nice and creamy on the inside. Will definitely make these again.",
