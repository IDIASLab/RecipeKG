ADDED:  About 1/2C - 3/4C of sliced mushrooms, sauteed in just a bit of bacon drippings w/ 1 clove of minced garlic. About 1/2C - 3/4C of whole kernel canned corn. A few splashes (2-3Tbsp maybe) Worcestershire sauce. Several extra cloves of minced garlic! Several generous shakes of garlic salt & onion powder. (No plain salt added.) Maybe 2Tbsp of ketchup - not much, just enough to add a little extra moisture/flavor. A generous handful of mild cheddar cheese on top of the potato crust.  It turned out so tasty! I think that that little extra burst of flavor from the handful of mild cheddar on top REALLY added a lot!  I was unsure of the addition of nutmeg - it just seemed odd - but after tasting the finished product will definitely do so again. I will certainly be making this dish in the future, and am looking forward to trying out new flavor combinations!  Thanks KMOMMYZ!",
