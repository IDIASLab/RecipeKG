I scaled this way down because I was only making it for a few people. Note: make more than you think you'll need. Not only is it delicious but the mushrooms shrink down some and you end up with very tiny portions. For example I scaled it down for 6 servings and it was really more like 3-4 small servings. Also when you toss everything together it doesn't look like there's enough liquid but as the mushrooms sit they really release their juices and you'll end up with plenty. I will be making this often especially when I have extra parlsey on hand that I don't know what to do with. Thanks for the great recipe!",
