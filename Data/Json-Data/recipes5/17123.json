Otherwise I followed the directions, served it over instant brown rice made with veggie broth, and topped with a dollop of fat free sour cream.  My husband wouldn't eat it because he is for some reason adverse to slightly sweet entree dishes.  I did not mind though because I got the leftovers!",

I left out the sugar since the tomatoes make it sweet enough unless you are a big fan of candy and have skewwed your sweet tooth. It was especially good with a little shredded sharp cheddar on top.",
