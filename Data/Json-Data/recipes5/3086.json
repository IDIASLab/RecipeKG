                "reviewBody": "The first crab salad I remember having was from The Sizzler--probably 15 years ago.  I thought it was great.  Not fine dining, but it was worth going to the Sizzler to get that crab salad.  Since then, I've had crab salad in restaurants many times, especially buffets.  Having learned to cook--at least half-way competently and therefore unafraid to try new recipes--I've been carrying the crab salad idea around in my brain for a few weeks.  To scratch the itch, I finally gave it a try.  WOW!  This is great stuff.  It has more of a tangy zing than any other crab salad I've tried, including at The Sizzler.  I would NOT omit the Italian dressing; That's what gives it the \"zing,\" though you may wish to reduce the amount.  I used what I had, 1/3 cup Italian dressing and the rest Italian Pesto dressing.  To get it ready for the steak and potatoes meal we had last night, I popped it in the freezer for 30 minutes.  That provided the salad with a chill that was just about right.  As another reviewer suggested, I used 1 1/2 pounds of crab meat.  Too, I wasn't real stingy with the green pepper, red onion, or celery, adding slightly more than that called for in the recipe.  Using more of these ingredients than called for prevented any \"soupiness.\"  The consistency was absolutely perfect.  This will go into my regular rotation of recipes.  Excellent!",

I did cut the recipe in half, so I might have accidentally used a whole amount for some of the dressing ingredients.  I'll just watch this the next time I make the salad.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 6/12/03:  Just made again and used the full recipe.  I still do think this is too much dressing for my taste - it is almost soupy and the dressing flavor overpowers the rest of the ingredients.  Will try to make two-thirds of the full recipe (of dressing) next time.",
