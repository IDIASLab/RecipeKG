So it's not the marinade that makes them tender and juicy! Marinade only penetrates a little more than the surface of the meat. He tried this recipe tonight to indulge my wanting to do something a little different. While he grilled his usual perfectly grilled chops again neither of us could taste the marinade but the hickory flavor was distinct and delicious. I don't know that I would bother with the marinade again since it uses ingredients you can't taste anyway and hate to waste.",
