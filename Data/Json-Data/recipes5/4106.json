Adjusted the spices to taste as written was a little on the soft side but that is good for those that may not like things too spicy. Used achar masala so added green cardamom pods and cinnamon stick. Sauteed those w/the cloves in onions. Added garlic near the end of the saute so it would not burn or get bitter. Thanks for another nice Indian recipe! I love your 'maharaja curry' also! Served w/saffron basmati rice w/some green peas tossed in for more color and texture. next time I will add a dollop of yogurt near the end for a little tang. The lemon juice did not provide enough tang to the recipe. It did not need any tart to thicken as it was just a perfect consistency on its own.",
