I think the fruits would be better in left to sit in the fridge overnight sprinkled with sugar. Then mix them with the lime and coconut milk in the morning. We can't wait to make this again especially when the fruits are in season! Update: I am afraid the love rating causes people to pass up this delicious recipe! I still make it till this day and we made it for a bbq and only half of them made it cause well they are just that scrumptious!",
