My only changes were to cut the recipe down to 2 servings but I still used a whole habanero (3x the listed amount) and I left in the seeds and veins. I used half the suggested amount of cilantro dried instead of fresh and broiled the chicken for 20 minutes instead of grilling. With the extra unseeded pepper this was extremely hot but still irresistable! Next time and there will be a next time I'll probably remove about half the pepper seeds and use a little less cinnamon and will definitely serve this with applesauce or something else to help cut the heat. If you aren't familiar with habaneros they're one of the hottest peppers you can get but they have a unique sweet taste that goes fantastic with chicken (and IMHO they freeze really well) so don't substitute if you can avoid it.",

When I found it I wanted to make it right away so I only marinated it for about 3 hrs with the chicken cut up in chunks for skewers on the grill... it tasted great with the grilled veggies. I also used jalapeno in it instead of habanero next time I will go with the habanero. My boyfriend raved about it he can't wait till we make it again. I made coconut black bean rice from this site to go with it and it paired really well.:0)",

Combo of ingredients is so unique in the end you should taste everything the cloves cinnamon brown sugar mmmmmmm can't wait to make again! Thanks Janis!",

Although this is not as spicy made as it still excellent and you can make it spicy to taste. It is slightly a pain to make but has superb flavor that everyone raved about. I made a huge batch to keep some on hand so it is worth the hassle. It can even be used to make a quick and tasty pasta sauce with some added milk or cream. Thank you for the favorable recipe!",

If you like cilantro than you'll love this. If you're not a fan the flavor is not overpowering. The spice combination did not overpower the meat so I wouldn't decrease the spices. And the brown sugar made a nice carmelized browning since the breasts I used were skinless. This would be good with turkey too. I found it made alot of marinade. I did up 6 breasts and I had lots leftover so I froze it. Hopefully it will keep well that way.",
