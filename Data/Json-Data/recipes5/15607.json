For the record 8 ounces egg noodles (uncooked) is too much for 4 servings (which this recipe is for as well). This was home-y comfort food tasting; somewhat velveeta-ish even with real cheese (blaming the canned soup). It's an inexpensive & pretty easy dish to make but I don't think I'll make it again. More notes: Cook the pork with the onions till almost done then add the garlic. No need to take 20 minutes for that part. The boiling & reboiling isn't necessasary either - just boil after adding the flour so it cooks. The taco seasoning flavor doesn't come through well until leftovers so probably need to simmer this 15 minutes before adding the cheese.",
