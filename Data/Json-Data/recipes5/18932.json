                "reviewBody": "Custard was great but only after doubling the sweetening. Perhaps some people like a barely sweet dessert but I was skeptical about 1/3 cup of brown sugar when I read the recipe knowing that a pumpkin pie filling that uses the same amounts of pumpkin and evaporated milk requires about 3/4 cup of sugar for proper sweetening. The orange juice will add some sweetness but not enough. After tasting the mixture before baking I doubled the sugar and it then tasted just right. Be sure to taste for it yourself before you bake it so that you can adjust the sweetness accordingly. Easiest prep is put everything in the blender then pour to fill the custard cups. No drips no mess one thing to wash. I cut the cayenne in half because 1) the bottle was new and potent and 2) I'm a wuss. 1/8 tsp cayenne added plenty of \"kick\" for me with a nice subtle warmth but no bite. Absolute perfection! This recipe works equally well with mashed cooked peeled sweet potato or squash (you need 2 cups.) Added a little orange peel which contributed an additional fresh clean flavor. Have also added 1 Tb dark rum which gives a lot of depth. I've also made it with Splenda (be sure to refrigerate well as Splenda can have a funky taste when warm.) All in all this is a wonderful concept a keeper recipe. Can be baked in a pie shell as well. 15 minutes at 425 then turn down to 350 for 45 minutes.",

Not necessary to used skimmed evaporated milk - the regular works too. Also I substitute 2 whole eggs for the 4 egg whites. As written it's a fat free recipe which is nice for dieters but for those not worried about a few calories using regular evaporated milk and whole eggs gives a nicer texture and doesn't add all that much in the way of fat or calories. I followed Baricat's advice and used only half the cayenne and we thought it was just right that way. It was warm but not burning hot. Also agree with her advice about the sweetening. It needs to be doubled or maybe even a tad more. We use Splenda here because of diabetes and 1 cup of Splenda is just about right.",

Also if you live in a cold climate like me I just turn my oven off and open the door somewhat to release the heat into the air and leave the custard in the oven to cool Then you dont scald yourself with the hot water of pan. Never waste that precious heat from your oven by closing the door in the winter time. YOu would be surprised if you use your oven like me alot just how much energy you can save.",
