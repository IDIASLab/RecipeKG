I seasoned with black pepper and teaspoon of red pepper flakes but omitted the salt. I returned pan to medium heat added potatoes and stirred for 3 min. I poured in 11 eggs and stirred for 6 min. Then I sprinkled 3 oz. of cheddar on top. I stirred the mixture repeatedly for 6-10 min. Lastly I transferred the mixture into a glass pie plate and cooked for 5 min on bottom oven rack. I cut up green onion and halved cherry tomatoes and placed on top of the frittata while it was still hot. I let it cool for 5 min and dug in! Delish!",

It got rave reviews from almost everyone my youngest thought it was weird to have hot peppers in eggs so refused it on principle lol. I made it again but had almost none of the insert ingredients so used leftover italian sausage the peppers and potatoes(of course) American cheese and broccoli. This one disappeared faster than the first one. Thanks Chef John for a new dish for the rotation!:-)",
