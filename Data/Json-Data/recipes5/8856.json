In order for the zucchini boats not to be undercooked, (ie. crunchy)  they should be baking in the oven while the stuffing is prepared.  I half-cooked the sausage, if nothing else just to get it a little eaiser to mix with the rest of the ingredients.  I used a hot italian sausage and it really added to the flavor.  Decrease the amount of breadcrumbs by 1/2 I also reccomend adding roasted red peppers (chopped), fresh basil and sundried tomatoes (chopped) to the stuffing along with crushed red pepper flakes (about 1 tablespoon).  Also make sure you use a good quality tomato sauce and lots of extra cheese.  There is so much potential with this recipe you just have to make it your own.",

You DO NOT need to brown the meat first and you should know not to use a very large zucchini and expect it to cook in 45 minutes without precooking it some. It was also delicious with regular sausage and good mozzarella! Everybody loved it.",

The only thing I changed were I used bulk Italian sausage and added an egg to the mixture.  Oh, and I upped the garlic (like triple or more) and added fresh basil to the sauce.  My recommendations- Use whatever sausage you like to start with.  Italian was great.  My friend Becky used Mushroom and Asiago that she got from Trader Joes.  I don't recommend Mozerella cheese.  Though it tasted fine, it resembled plastic on top.  My friend used jack cheese and it was great.  I love the sauce.  I want more of it (50-100 percent more.  We served it with Pasta.  My friend used brown Batsmati rice.  I liked them both, but the rice was better to me.  We just wanted more of that yummy sauce.",

First, after halving the zucchini I microwaved them for a few minutes to pre-cook them a bit.  I browned the sausage, using Italian sausage I had removed from the casings.  To that I added chopped red and yellow bell pepper, onion and the garlic, more than called for, and some fresh herbs. I did chop the zucchini pulp and added that too.  I used no bread crumbs or other filler.  I mixed up the mozzarella and Parmesan, added some to the sausage mixture and reserved some to sprinkle over the top.  Rather than spaghetti sauce I used a good quality marinara, much less than 32 ounces, as I didn\u2019t want the zucchini swimming in sauce.  I baked this, uncovered, for just over half an hour.  I served Hubs his over a bed of rice and left my low-carb version as is.  Delicious.",
