My eggs must have had really thick membranes because even though I thoroughly cracked the shells the dye didn't soak through to the egg white except for in a couple of places. WARNING - if you want to pipe the filling into the eggs do not use a star tip - the celery plugged the tip - I pushed a little too hard to try and clear it and ended up with a green egg yolk explosion. As for the filling it needs to be kicked up a notch. Thanks for a fun idea - it just didn't work out too well for me.",
