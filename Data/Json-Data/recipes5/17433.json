As the bacon cooks, it shrinks, & the cracker resembles a bow tie. Depending on your bacon (quality/thickness), they could possibly bake up to 2 hrs, even. These keep incredibly well for several days in an airtight container.",

I took earlier advice and lined CLUB rectangular crackers (better fit for bacon) on a cookie cooling rack over a baking sheet lined with parchment, just in case of the bacon grease factor. Only made about 30 of them, and that said, used about 8 slices applewood smoked bacon, cut into fourths, and they fit well on the cracker. Did a light dash of cayenne for some heat, then sprinkled with brown sugar, and cooked for an hour. I think you could up the heat a little on your oven (275?), or just broil them at the end to caramelize the brown sugar a little more. The crackers weren't soggy, and they were quite good and easy to make, with hardly any mess or grease on the pan. I think the choice of lean bacon is key to this one. Smokey, sweet, crunchy and little heat from the cayenne. I'll definitely do this one again. Note - for me, they tasted better warm than cold, but they reheat well and quickly.",

One tip for people who like bacon as lean as possible--don't \"wrap\" the bacon around the cracker; the bacon on the bottom will still be a litte fatty. Just lay the bacon on top as in the original recipe. And SPRINKLE just a little brown sugar. Too much and it won't melt. These are SOOOO good.",

You can serve them right from the tin or heat them up a bit in a low oven right before serving. It's a great make ahead treat!!",
