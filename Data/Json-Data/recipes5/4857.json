I also substituted extra virgin olive oil as I had no grape seed oil on hand. I served the dressing on a Greek salad made of spinach chopped orange bell peppers kirby cukes red onion feta kalamata olives and tomatos from our garden. The dressing has a great fresh and balanced taste with a bright sweet and flavorful balance. Thanks for making this great dressing recipe available as it will be a regular at our table!",
