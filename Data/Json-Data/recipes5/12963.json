All the had were Marion's Kitchen curry kits which did have the paste inside. Going by another reviewer I got the Thai red curry kind. I ended up combining the instructions for the kit and the recipe leaving out the heavy cream since the kit came with coconut milk. I just made the sauce and mixed it with the ingredients from the recipe. It turned out very good! the dried chillies from the kit and the maple syrup balanced each other out very well. Just the right amount of sweetness and spicy. Everyone loved it!",
