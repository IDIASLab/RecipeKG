On the back of the pancake box, it says mix 2 eggs, 2 c. dry pancake mix and milk.  Although I knew to use the apple cider in place of the milk, I wasn't sure about the eggs.  add? Not add? I choose not to so the pancakes turned out a little doughy but I'll try this again, with eggs, to see if they're fluffier.  The flavor was still good. Also, I reduced the nutmeg and cinnamon by half and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.  This does remind me of fall and we served with hot apple cider.  Hopefully next time, they'll turn out right.",

We knew we could not finish the slumber party without cooking brunch - it's a long standing tradition. Unfortunately this year the sixth friend was unable to make the breakfast due to a car accident. The rest of us were hesitant to cook her famous waffles without her so we logged on and found this recipe. I added two eggs to mine in addition to some heavy-duty mixing a little more vanilla and chopped apples. My friend Jenna the hardest to please (the food expert of the group - also the most rotund if I may say so) actually asked me for the recipie and we made another batch and brought it over to our friend in need. Thanks for making our stomachs full our mouths happy and our injured friend comforted with the flavors of fall.",
