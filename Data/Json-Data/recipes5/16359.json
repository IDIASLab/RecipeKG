Personally, as the recipe stands I think there is no point in adding cheddar, as it is drowned out by the cinnamon and brown sugar.  If you want afternoon apple bran cheddar muffins, reduce the cinnamon and sugar, and increase the amount of cheddar.  If you sweet apple cinnamon bran muffins, leave out the cheddar...  Thanks for this recipe, its a great place to start and ends up with many potential great outcomes!!!",

I used 1 cup milk shredded the apple used 2/3 cup melted real butter instead of the veg oil used 1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup white flour (instead of all white) 1 cup cheddar and added about 2/3 cup of chopped walnuts. With all of these changes it made too much for one batch so I split it in 2 batches. My boyfriend and I LOVE them and these will definitely be made again! Mmmmm!",
