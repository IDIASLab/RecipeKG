I just put all the marinade ingredients into my mini chopper and gave it a whirl - but I used 3/4 soy sauce and 1/4 water so it wouldn't be too salty and the flavour turned out perfect. I poured it over the steak strips and added some pepper sauce to the mix and let it marinate for about 4 hours. I also cooked down the marinade into a thick sauce to put over the meat. End result was so delicious! I will definitely use this marinade for other meats. I love the given name btw LOL. Thank for sharing.",

It also seems to be missing an acid and so the soy sauce and other flavors were really prominent. I really made the mistake of using a very expensive and tender cut of meat. This marinade is really meant for a tougher cut of meat like most marinades I guess. I just had to use what I had. I ended up broiling it like I do for many meats. The marinade appeared to be infused in the meat but it leaked everywhere. I had not had as much liquid in other marinades separate from the meat like that. Now I have a big mess to clean up tonight in the oven. Use a cheap cut of meat and a pan with sides or a grill and this recipe may work out fine for you. Maybe I just needed a little more instruction on what type of meat to use and the best way to cook it on this one.",
