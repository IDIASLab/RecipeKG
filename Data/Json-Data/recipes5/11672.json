I saut\u00e9ed the leeks and added pur\u00e9e at the end just to warm it up. Instead of butter in the crepes and filling, I used olive oil infused with rosemary. It was fantastic. Next time, I\u2019ll try sage infused oil. I made the crepes in the morning then filled and baked in the afternoon. This is a good idea to use at holidays because you can make them a day ahead and they reheat wonderfully.",
