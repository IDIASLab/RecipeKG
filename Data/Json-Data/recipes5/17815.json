What can I say? It's the only citrus I had available! But my, oh my, what a fantastic result! My husband raved about this chicken all night long and again today. \n\nI was only able to marinate it for a few hours, and I used the broiler instead of the grill, but the results were still spectacular. Wonderful flavor and very tender! I think the key is to cook them only the amount of time required and not a minute longer. \n\nI also reserved some of the marinade before soaking the breasts, so when they came out of the broiler I placed them immediately into the sauce. Oh my word. Heavenly. I mean, this is likely going to be the only marinade I use for chicken breasts for some time to come. Can't wait to try it with the actual lime and lemon juice! Now, I'm wondering how this would work with shrimp...or pork...",

Only change I did was I used 2 tbsp whole grain mustard, and 1 tbsp dijon mustard, then used hand blender to smooth out marinade some. Cubed chicken and poured half marinade in bag with chicken and the other half in another bag to put in the freezer for future use and marinaded for 8 hours. Skewered chicken/green pepper/onion/pineapple and grilled on each side (4 sides) 2 minutes each, basting with a little left over marinade left out of the bags. It was wonderful! I'll be making this all summer! TY!",

I didn't have time to marinate and grill but I put the marinade (made a 1/2 recipe) in a glass baking dish with the chicken (sliced up 2 boneless breasts to make cutlets) and baked at 350 until done.  I do that often in place of grilling chicken- the meat soaks up so much of the tasty marinade that way, and it's so fast. ",

Recipe calls for 6-8 minutes of cooking time per side ~ please note if this doesn't seem long enough for  you, the citrus in the marinate makes the chicken cook faster.  Do not overcook as your chicken will turn rubbery.  Wonderful chicken to add to salads!  New favorite in our home!  Thanks Letsgggo for the submission.",

I used the same amount of marinade for 3 chicken breasts that I pounded down thin used 3 tablespoons of olive oil vs. 6 and used dijon mustard instead of course ground.
