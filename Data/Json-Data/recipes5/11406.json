The gremolata really makes the recipe special. Definitely make a little extra! The pop of parsley and the earthy sun-dried tomatoes added freshness and also christmas vibes with the colors! As with all soups tasted better then next day. Only things I modified were that I added a few more dried herbs I had on hand I think basil and oregano (and likely some garlic powder) and deglazed the veggies in white wine before adding the broth. Would make again!",
