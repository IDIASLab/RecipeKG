When they come out of the microwave I spread them out and immediately sprinkle them lightly with kosher salt.  Absolutely delicious!  Also, when I buy nuts of any kind I always toast them as soon as I get home, put them into storage containers (zip type baggies) and keep them in the freezer.  Nuts keep forever that way and are so much better when toasted.",

I had enough caramel sauce to coat 16 oz (4 cups) of walnuts.  The cooking time totaled 5 minutes, and I cooled the nuts on a cookie sheet that I'd sprayed w/ butter-flavor Pam.  The nuts were soft while they were hot, but crisped up after they cooled, tho the caramel stayed slightly sticky.  DH tasted and thought they needed \"something\" so I sprinkled the cooled nuts w/ a few good pinches of salt, and that seemed to do the trick.  I just packed them back into the original Diamond walnut container (after I covered it in wrapping paper and added ricrac to the lid!).  This is a new holiday favorite!  2010: Gave these to a friend who was heading out on the road (apparently they didn't last past the state line...), and to coworkers for Christmas gifts, to RAVE reviews.  2011: One of the guys to whom I gave these last Christmas used his to make baked French toast for their family's Christmas breakfast. I haven't seen him in months, but I got a call from him shortly before this Christmas, asking for this recipe, as his newly pregnant daughter-in-law was asking for his baked French toast with the spiced nuts in it like he'd made last year! 2013: Made these for coworkers for Super Bowl snacks, to the usual rave reviews; used walnuts, pecans and almonds, changed up the spices...I will NEVER tire of this recipe!",
