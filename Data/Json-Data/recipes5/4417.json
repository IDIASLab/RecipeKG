I had a lot of stuffing left over so instead of grilling, I placed the steaks in a fish pan, topped with remaining stuffing, poured the remaining oil-lemon mixture of steaks, and baked on 350 for 15-20 minutes.  If I had some pine nuts on hand, I would have added them too.  Very easy prep and clean up,  Not the most amazing dish as far as flavor but will make again.",
