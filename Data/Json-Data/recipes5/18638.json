SOLUTIONS: ONE: In step 2 you must combine on very low heat and leave gently heating for at least 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Waiting for just the butter to melt is NOT long enough. The reason is that the brown sugar needs to liquefy. TWO: As good as they smell you must allow them to cool UNTIL COLD ..... Follow both these directions with the above recipe and you'll be fine. ..... My personal changes: When I add chopped dates I remove the same size amount from the oats. For example if I add 1/4 cup of dates, I remove 1/4 cup of oats. I also make them in a muffin tin for individual lunch box portions (as my photo shows). Enjoy.",

(If you can't find porage/Scottish oats, just toss some rolled oats in the blender and pulse a couple times until the oats approach the size of instant potato flakes)\n-I doubled or tripled the amount of golden syrup so that it would stick together a little better.  (I just added it until it seemed dense enough)\n-I used sultanas instead of raisins so it would be easier to chew - just toss some raisins in boiling water until they're plump and tender.  I used both black and golden raisins.\n\nI baked them in a metal pan, and next time I would cut the time by 5-7 minutes because they ended up a little tough around the edges.\n\nThey turned out great!

I followed it to the \"T,\" making sure to completely melt the sugar and corn syrup and brown sugar.  It takes a little longer, but it's worth it.  I used \"quick oats\" and easily fit all 3 cups worth in with the melted mixture by just mixing one cup at a time.  I pressed it all into a pan (greased the bottom only) which help it to stick together better, too, and I used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  I would bake it for the full 30 minutes next time as it was a little bit soft from less time.  But the big key is cooling completely.  I tried them before that and the parts that were still warm broke apart while the pieces completely cooled stayed together.  During my time living in England, I tasted quite a few variations of flapjacks.  These definitely tasted authentic.  ENJOY!",
