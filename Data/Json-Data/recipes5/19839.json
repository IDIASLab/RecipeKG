Also, my turkey legs got really brown within the first hour and at the end of cooking, everything in the pan was black!  The legs got a bit dried out. I followed the recipe exactly, too.  I made the gravy by taking out all the blackened veggies and then adding the sugar and wine, etc.  - and it was really good.  I wonder if I should have covered the roasting pan when I cooked the legs?  I would shorten the first cooking time for sure.  I will make it again, but adjust temps and cooking times!",

I only got to do 1 1/2 hours at 400 then not quite a half hour at 300 and they were already done. So now I have to find a creative way to keep them hot for the next hour and 45 minutes! (kind of frustrating) I can only imagine the state of the legs if I had kept cooking for another almost two hours! And forget about gravy. Everything in the pan is charcoal black - onions garlic and spices - there is no water or broth in this recipe so everything just fries to a crisp leaving nothing but butter oil and black bits to make gravy with. Not sure how this recipe got so many 5 stars... check out other turkey leg recipes... they all say to roast them in 2 hours and they add some kind of liquid... kind of makes you wonder if maybe they are right!",

Since some of the reviewers said the veggies at the bottom were getting burned instead of baking for 400 degrees for an hour before lowering the heat I let it cook for about three hours at 300 degrees and I covered the roasting pan in tin foil. It came out perfectly cooked and incredibly moist with a lot of great flavor. The gravy is also superb I would keep this recipe for that alone.",

I will say I listened to the reviews and tweaked the times. 400 for about an hour 300 for about 45 min 200 30 min or until skin is brown. It takes some tweaking and some intuition. I keep an eye on the internal temperature when I get to my 165 then I start concentrating on the skin browning. basting every 20 min is a must! if you see the onions getting over done or not enough juice to baste just add some chicken broth to the pan. I do thighs as well as Drumsticks (family request) and the recipe works great on thighs as well. Tried the thighs on a rack one year family said back in the pan too dry on the rack.
