We substituted shortening for lard and vegie broth for chicken. The only stumbling block I came across was cooking the peppers. I followed the instructions, but kept thinking the peppers weren't hot enough from the grill pan. After letting them sit in the plastic bag, they still weren't done. So I repeated the process, except I put the pan in the oven at 450 for about 15 minutes, then put them in the bag. We ended up with extra green sauce, which we pureed and used at the table. I also added some of the puree to rice, which completed our meal. My daughter is already talking about making more and freezing them. Thanks so much for this recipe!",

The recipe states to salt to taste so we can't blame the recipe LOL! I myself thought it kind of bland in taste ( and I added Mexican chili powder to the masa and shredded chicken) and also noticed that those who raved also threw in lots more flavor. My suggestion is if you like lots of flavor you need to add the spices you love. I think it's a great starter recipe. I'll make it again but will certainly add a great deal more than I initially did. A tamale should be able to stand on its own in flavor without having to douse it in hot sauce or other condiments.",
