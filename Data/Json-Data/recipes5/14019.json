It slow cooks once browned, so you can be straightening up the house while it simmers. You can get the boneless shoulder roast and roll it very tightly yourself and tie it several times with butcher string. Sometimes if you explain to the butcher, they will do it for you. Great served with fresh steamed asparagus or green bean spears.",

I served it using the veal to some friends of ours with a nice salad and inexpensive wine they told me that was one of the best dinners they have had and asked for this recipe.

Finally for the gravy I removed all the veggies and plated them around the veal then added the flour dissolved in water without the egg yolks. The end product was great. I served it with wild rice and garlic roasted brussel sprouts on the side. Even my husband who is generally not a veal fan had seconds. I will definitely make again.",
