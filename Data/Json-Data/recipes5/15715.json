This is also nice b/c when you have leftover taco meat that you don't know what to do with you can freeze it and make this dip practically at a moments notice! I also stir it every so often so it melts/combines evenly. This is a hit w/ everyone who tries it!:)",

They ate so much of this dip we almost skipped dinner. It takes 20 minutes to prepare and cook. I will ensure I always keep these ingredients on hand in our panty.
