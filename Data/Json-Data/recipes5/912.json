I did add about 1/4 cup of water to the bottom to avoid burning and I added onion slices on top of each pork chop as I was layering.  The result was incredible, no knife required, and the slightly thinned onion loaded sauce was good on my potatoes.  I'm going to try the leftovers over rice.",

My family really enjoyed the Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken BBQ recipe by Zanne Peters from this website which had these additional ingredients:  1/2 cup of italian dressing, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 2 tbsp. of worcestershire sauce.    If you want to add a little kick to  this recipe, I would suggest adding these along with the BBQ sauce of your choice.   It gives it a great taste whether you're using chicken or pork!!  Thanks!",

I served them with mashed potatoes and green beans. My family loved them. I will definitely make these again.",

I cooked it like suggested, but the last 30 mins turn it down too low. My husband and girls liked it a lot. However my husband said the sauce was to thin. I told him I had read everyone on the site, said add some water to help it not burn. He said I didn't need too. Next time we make it we will not add the water and see if it is better. It was easy and tasty. thank you for sharing your idea.",
