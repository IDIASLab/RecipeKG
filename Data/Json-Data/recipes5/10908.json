I followed Chef John's recipe exactly and it turned out extremely well-balanced, which I was a little worried about given the amount of walnuts (I didn't want it to be super walnut-forward). I've uploaded a picture of how I served mine, with chicken pita pockets and bell peppers. I garnished with some parsley and an extra tiny drizzle of olive oil just to give it a light sheen, since it comes out of the fridge fairly matte in appearance. It was great as a dip with the fresh sliced orange bell peppers (I used red peppers in the recipe) and as a binding agent for my pita pocket ingredients (pan seared chicken, saut\u00e9ed onions and peppers).\n\nP.S. I can't stress enough the importance of the fridge chill here. I tried my muhammara fresh out of the food processor to taste it, and it was pretty good. But after it chilled completely in the fridge, all the flavors just seemed to fortify and really shine and it became great.",

Sometimes you can tell if a recipe is wonderful even if you don't have all the ingredients or wish to make it as your own. This is one of those. My shortcut is: I roasted 1 red and 1 yellow pepper and 1 onion cut in 2\" pieces with a small amount of olive oil until soft in a hot oven for about 30 minutes on a nonstick lined pan. In a food processor walnuts and set aside then garlic then peppers and onions. Seasoned to taste with all suggested ingredients (it tasted sweet so I didn't add molasses). Next time I will make it without the bread crumbs and additional olive oil for saving calories.",
