I don't drink milk, so I added almond milk instead but it was delicious and it cured my cold. I also threw in a jalapeno because I like spicy and i was really trying to heal myself..\n\nBack story- I got a cold from a coworker, but since I run an office, I don't have the \"luxury\" of taking a sick day. So I went on here to find a recipe that was easy and had healing properties (like ginger) and I made this soup while being really sick. Sneezing between cutting the celery.NEXT DAY I was feeling better,less rundown. It was amazing and I decided to make it again today because I feel the sniffles coming and it is freezing out.",

I didn't have bone-in chicken to make a quick stock but I did have enough frozen turkey stock and two boneless chicken breasts to use in its place so I just added everything in steps 1-3 to my stock and let her simmer. I don't think it would be all that different if you started from scratch with some canned stock or even bouillon cubes because we devoured the soup on day one and overnight the noodles soaked up all of the soup broth. For day two I made some chicken bouillon broth and added it to the leftovers; it was still delicious nonetheless! I didn't have any leek so I substituted yellow onion. It may not have been fancy but is sufficed sure enough. The addition of ginger had me skeptical but it added a distinct but subtle flair that I cannot recommend more. Stick it in there! Lastly the homemade noodles were incomparable. They really added the homemade touch and I would certainly take the time again especially if my intent was for a comforting meal or I was cooking for friends. Well done Shasty!",

Even though I felt that I had screwed up the noodles several times they turned out to be pretty fool-proof. I did make one significant alteration to the original recipe -- I used three times as many bouillon cubes as the recipe called for because I found the broth to be a bit bland without it (this may have been because the bouillon cubes I had were pretty old). Aside from that this recipe is pretty close to perfection.",
