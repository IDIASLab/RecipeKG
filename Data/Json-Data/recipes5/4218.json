Although my husband and I both enjoyed it, I do think the recipe needs tweaking. The lemon juice really overpowered the other flavors in the soup (this could be because I used freshly-squeezed juice), so next time I will start with 2 tablespoons and increase to taste.  I will also sautee the garlic with the onions, which I think will give it a rounder, more complex taste.  Finally, the consistency was a little watery for me, so I'll cut down on the water by 25% or so next time.  All in all, very good with a few adjustments.",

The lemon juice is a must - don't forget to add some at the end!  I didn't find it to be too salty at all and I'm usually sensitive to sodium.\n\nI followed previous reviewers' advice and sauteed the onion with half the garlic and sauteeed the collard greens with the other half of the garlic.  Make sure you cook the collards thoroughly - they can sometimes be a little tough if undercooked.  \n\nI found that this made a little more than 4 servings.  I filled up 4 leftover Chinese food pint containers and froze two of them.  I plan to take them for lunch to work.  \n\nThis is a cheap, nutritious, and delicious soup.  Thanks so much for sharing it!",
