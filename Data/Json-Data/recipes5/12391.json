Next time I'd dice it a bit more finely. \n\nI was cutting up a couple of  on-sale Boston butt roasts to get pork for braising and pulled pork. There were bits and pieces too small for braising, so I trimmed and  minced them up into my own ground pork.  Not without effort, but less time than it takes to drive to a butcher.  Also pretty much free. \n\nI had a package of wood ear mushrooms so added them to the other ingredients. I think they made a nice addition, but wouldn't make a special effort to include them in the future. \n\nI have to watch my calories during the day to be able to eat Chef John's dinners.  I will absolutely use the shitake/chicken broth to make super low cal chicken/shrimp  and vegetable soups for my lunches.  Very flavorful.",

And it was a lot of work with some exotic ingredients that will unlikely be used again before having to be thrown away. Dish was tasty enough (tho a bit salty..more brown sugar?) but won't make again for those reasons.",
