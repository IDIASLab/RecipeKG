I added a Tbsp. of honey to the sauce after removing it from the heat to make the taste a little less bitter. I'm glad I made the change! Also I didn't have any lemons so I skipped on that as well. In the end it turned out great and will go down as one of my favorite salmon dishes!",

In that case, I highly recommend that you double it because it is just that good!  It can be made ahead, leaving you plenty of time for any other tasks you have before serving dinner.  The only change I made was to use a touch of tarragon in place of the chervil called for because I don't normally have that.  We really loved the quartered lemon that went into the sauce, so don't skimp on that!  Thank you so much!  I want to have this again this week!  That says it all, I believe!",
