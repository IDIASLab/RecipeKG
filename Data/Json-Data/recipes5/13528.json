Also used a real egg instead of the egg substitute. Added a few dashes of nutmeg and ginger. The recipe said to slice the strawberries but chopped into smaller pieces seemed to work better. Also I poured it into a loaf pan instead of a muffin tin turned out beautifully. I am concerned about my sugar intake but the boys in my house are not so I drizzled a powdered sugar glaze over top of their slices and they LOVED it.",

Also I didn t quite have a cup of sliced strawberries so I threw in some fresh blueberries to reach that amount. Other than the sweetness you get from a bite of the juicy fruit the muffin itself is weak in flavor. Egg Beaters are always in my fridge and I use Truvia so I had no adjustment to those two ingredients I just think this needs more flavor. Maybe some cinnamon Truvia brown sugar or almond extract instead of vanilla might help? Little high in carbs to be called healthy by my standards but as far as overall nutrition it does break down pretty well.",
