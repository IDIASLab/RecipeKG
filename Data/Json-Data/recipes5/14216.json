My response was that I've never used tomatillos ever in my life. Well this was the lucky recipe I chose and I'm glad I did. It was a great choice. Excellent flavor and very easy to do. The serrano peppers were small and after roasting I couldn't get the skin off without tearing them apart so I just threw them in the blender with skins on.... didn't notice one bit!! Will definitally make this again!!",

Next time I will try using the serranos. I have a hand blender and I used that to blend it up. If you use a regular blender make sure you clean it very well if you don't want your smoothies to taste like chile!",
