                "reviewBody": "I tried entering another message about this recipe, but it didn't work.  I'm the submitter.  I've found that the reason people are having problems with the oil step is that they're putting entirely too much oil on each potato.  I did the same thing last year....yikes!  \r\n\r\nYOu can omit the oil and foil step, and just bake noramlly.  Microwaving is fine, too, but check on them periodically so you don't over cook them.\r\n\r\nAlso, the recipe should call for 1/3 to 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  If you like it sweet, at 1/2 cup.  Otherwise, leave it at 1/3 cup.  \r\n\r\nWe normally love marshmallows on our sweet potatoes, but we don't on this recipe because of all the other wonderful flavors.  The marshmallows were overkill for us.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for all the great suggestions and tips.  I've tried a few myself, and while they're good, we prefer my original recipe (minus the oil step just because it really is time consuming to do that).  \r\n\r\nAlso, one more tip...leave enough flesh in the skins so they retain their shapes and are easier to work with.  Removing too much flesh will leave you with a casserole in a dish!  :-)",

                "reviewBody": "Wow! What a surprise! Really rich and filling -- and really tasty. I have two suggestions. 1) Cut back on the brown sugar a little bit. As is it's a bit too much like dessert to compliment other menu items. 2) IMPORTANT: When scooping out the flesh from the skins leave a little bit of the potatoe flesh there to retain the shape of the skin. I found that tracing with the spoon an oval shape of the flesh to be removed was an easy way to do this. Then I just scooped out what I'd traced out. Regarding foil or no foil I've tried both. I think using foil is a bit better as the skins don't risk burning at all. I do not use oil in either case. Great and surprising recipe! Walnuts are a great addition.",

I also added 2 TB of lemon juice 1 TB pumpkin pie spice changed the walnuts to pecans & topped with marshmallows. I have been asked to bring this again for Christmas. Thanks Shannon great find:)",
