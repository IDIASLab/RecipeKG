We're at the height of strawberry season here in West Tennessee so this recipe is right on time. Bearing in mind previous reviews I was cautious with the Balsamic vinegar. One tablespoon was plenty for me. And if you know as little about mangoes as I did I suggest you search the net for tips on how to buy and how to chop. Thank you Sarah. Just how do stay out of this long enough for it to rest??",
