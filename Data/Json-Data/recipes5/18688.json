I took the advice of Granyloohoo (who always gives great advice in her reviews!) and used 1/4 cup each of the honey and brown sugar 3 Tbsp of oil and 1/4 tsp salt.

I added 1/2 a cup coconut while baking and dumped in some craisins when I took it out of the oven. Excellent!",

I was visiting family in a different state and I paid 6 bucks for a bag of granola from a health food store and it had basicly the same exact ingredients as this recipe. My husband and I loved it so much I've been looking for something like it ever since.. I never even thought to make it myself till Allrecipes featured it on the main page this week. This was a SUPER EASY recipe to make and like other suggestions I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and used almond slivers instead of peanuts. My house smells Wonderful and it's not even fully cooled yet and me and the kids can't stop picking at it... it tastes AWSOME! I'm going to play w/ this and maybe next time add some real maple syurp and a some different nuts you could have a blast trying something new every time you make this! THANKS!!!
