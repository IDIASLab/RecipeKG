I didn't have peanut oil so used grape seed oil. I microwaved my peeled chopped sweet potato a bit before adding it to the liquid mix to be sure it ended up being thoroughly cooked. I used chunky peanut butter and skipped the extra nuts. I didn't have fresh collards so used a handful of turnip greens from can and squeezed out the excess liquid between paper towels. Worked just fine and gave it color. Next time will try fresh collards but would probably microwave them in advance as well to be sure they get cooked enough in the process. Served over 90 second garden rice and it made for a very nice meal.",

I also used a bag of frozen collard greens instead of fresh, as well as olive oil instead of peanut oil and it still turned out amazing!  I have a friend who is married to a man from Ghana and she makes something similar to this all the time.  She serves it with rice so I did the same.  My husband loved it too!",
