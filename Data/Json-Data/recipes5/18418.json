These ribs were pretty good but next time I'll cut down on the red pepper flakes. I found the intensity of the heat almost overpowers the other flavors but all in all good flavor combination and the ribs were really tasty. Only reason I'm holding back one star is for the reason listed above but for sure this recipe is worth making and I plan to make it again soon. Thanks Ryan!",
