I do not own a glass lid for my Instant Pot. I made do with a glass lid from other cookware.  My IP is the simple version 6 quart. I started a timer on my stove when the first 2 kernels popped. Listened to the popping to almost stop which was less than 3 minutes.  Turned off the IP ,removed the lid, dumped the popcorn into a large bowl.  Almost No unpopped kernels, even though my popcorn was a bit old. I will make this again! Thanks!",
