The aeration from the blender made the sauce lose it's slick rich color so I won't do that again. I will probably just dice the onion much smaller next time. These are not for the faint-hearted!",

As one reviewer suggested I added some liquid smoke and instead of crushed pineapple and pineapple juice used pineapple sauce!! I also did add a lot more hot sauce simply b/c I wanted a really hot sauce.",
