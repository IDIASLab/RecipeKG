I used small spiny cucumbers so I wouldn't have to deal with seeds. I'll be serving this with Melba toast. Next time I might add some diced jalapenos from the garden since just like the cucumbers we have a bunch. Edited to add: I have made this many times. I love adding jalapeno it gives it a nice kick! I also throw in extra garlic and some cayenne.",
