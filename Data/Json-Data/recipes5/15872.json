I measured 1 lb of leftover turkey and just mixed the taco seasoning all over it.  Threw it in the casserole dish, threw the cheese on top of it and then topped with the cornbread topping.  It turned into an amazing Turkey Tamale type casserole. Will be making this regularly.",

The cornbread topping seemed to taste very artifical but I'm sure it was because of the brand of cornbread mix used. (We rarely eat this sort of thing.) Also the texture of the topping was more gooey than I expected not breadlike even though I baked it longer than the recipe stated. Maybe next time omit the creamed corn. Also added a mini can of diced chilis to the turkey. I'll make it again. I thought it was a great way to use ground turkey.",
