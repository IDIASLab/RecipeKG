I then put them back in the oven until the were no longer shiny. They came out just like the nuts in the mall. Crunchy, slightly sweet and impossible to keep you hands off of!",

If it isn't the nuts will be soggy and stick together.  In order not to add anymore moisture, I used Reynolds Release foil and ditched the PAM spray.  Even still, I found they needed to be baked longer (maybe 1/2 hour total)and that as they were cooling, I had to turn them to get them dry all around.  They stored nicely for almost a month in a ziplock bag.  They were the perfect addition to my Citrus Splash Salad!  These will be trotted out in my house again at Christmas time for sure!",

I use part white sugar and part brown sugar and definitely add cinnamon.  After beating the egg whites I just add 1 pound of pecan halves and pour them onto a large baking sheet that's been sprayed with cooking spray.  Make sure have a sheet big enough so that you don't have to pile them on top of each other or they stick together and don't toast up as well.  I bake them at 250 for 1 hour and stir them every 15 minutes.  You get beautifully toasted and crunchy pecans every time.  The longer roasting time really brings out the flavor of the pecans and you never get soggy ones.  This is a family favorite year round.",
