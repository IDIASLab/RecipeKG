        "description": "It's easy to love fall-off-the-bone short ribs. The only problem with a traditional braising recipe is that it will be hours before eating happens. Make short ribs in an electric pressure cooker and eat these in half the time. The pressure inside the cooker transforms any liquid into hot steam, which goes deep into the meat and produce far more tender ribs than any other method would make. Less time and better? You bet.",

I also coated all sides of the ribs with the flour and browned all sides.  The ribs absorbed some of the wine during marinating, so when you cut into them- they had a nice wine flavor.  The meat was very tender, and most slid right off of the bone!  They were also very flavorful with the rosemary, garlic, veggies, and the wine.  I was worried that the meat would turn out blah- like with another recipe that I tried in the IS.  Some things are just better cooked another way- but these turned out great!  Will definitely make again!",
