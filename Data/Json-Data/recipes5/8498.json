I don't know what the problem was for the previous user and the cheese first I don't know how long you beat the cheese for but I did mine for about 2 minutes and it was nice and smooth no chunks at all.. maybe your cheese was bad or you beated for too long or not enough? Secondly I see marascapone in almost every grocery store I go in. I would think cream cheese would give it a whole different taste. Anyway the only problem I had was for them making it to the serving platter. lol This recipe also made about 16 medium plump strawberries for us and was a huge hit! Will definitely make these again and again.",

I also dipped the ends of some of the berries in chocolate let it set then put filling in. Awesome!!!!!",

Even thought I am an accomplished cook mascarpone cheese is not easily found and so I have not ever used it.When I found this recipe I thought it would make a great topping for a lemon chiffon cake I was making for a party and since I follow directions to the letter proceeded to BEAT the cheese...... so I ended up with 6 of cheese down the drain and a concoction that looked like ricotta! The flavor was good but I thought a tad sweet so I would recommend cutting the sugar by 1/2 a cup. I ended up using this recipe but with cream cheese (and not as much sugar) and it turned out great for my cake.",
