If you want more of a zing I guess you could add something like garlic to it. I served the red onions on the side as my husband isn't a big onion fan. I'd never bought jicama (or an English cucumber) before & it was a nice change. The jicama adds more of a crisper texture almost like an apple. This is a nice healthy alternative to the standard lettuce salad.",
