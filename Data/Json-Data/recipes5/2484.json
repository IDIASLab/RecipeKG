        "description": "The secret to these moist and tender chicken breasts is the feta brine. Not only does the brine prevent the breasts from drying out, the feta adds a subtle, tangy yet fresh flavor. This also works well with bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces, but be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly. Bruising the herbs releases their lovely aromatic oils without having to worry about picking the bits off the chicken when done brining.",

It gave a lot if flavour and broiled the top of the chicken after they were done baking. Served with herb roasted potatoes saut\u00e9e peppers onions and snowpeas with balsamic glaze. Finished with a nice kale slaw at the end of the meal. Bbq'ing this will be great too.",
