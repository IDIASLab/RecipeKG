The only thing I did differently was cook shrimp with the scallops and instead of eating on bread I served it in my seafood alfredo. The scallops came out SO tender and flavorful! I was actually quite shocked at how good these came out given the fact that I have NEVER made scallops before. Such an easy recipe all you need to do is follow the cooking instructions exactly. Even the shrimp came out amazing! My family loved this and my boyfriend said these were awesome! He already went and put more scallops on the shopping list for next time!",

Then I made it to serve over pasta as noted at the bottom of the recipe.  For the appetizer 1 1/2 of bay scallops is a lot for 4 servings but as a main dish it was perfect.  Make sure you have everything prepped and ready as this cooks really fast and make sure your pan is smoking hot to quickly sear the scallops.   The only thing I did differently is to use garlic olive oil on the bread and I toasted the bread in a cast iron skillet.  For the pasta dish I added some Parmesan cheese to the top of each serving.   Enjoy!",

I would recommend making the sauce separately from the scallops so that it has time to reduce and thicken, and you are able to get more of a sear on your scallops.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're considering using zucchini noodles, I recommend against long, thick strips (like fettucine) and opt for thinner slicing (like angel hair). Thick zucchini noodles fight against the small scallops and don't soak up enough sauce.",
