Using vanilla yogurt added a nice touch (the possibilities are endless with the flavors of yogurt!).  I brought one pie made with this crust to a gathering, and everyone loved the crust, because it was different.  \r\nWord of caution:  I used this on a bigger pie plate (deep dish), and the dough was spread a little thin, so ended up a little on the hard and crunchy side (not my favorite).  I'd add an extra few graham crackers and a  bit more yogurt if making a larger pie.  Crust should be fairly thick for ultimate taste.",

I had graham crackers so I just crushed them instead of buying crumbs (though the former is a bit more time-consuming).  I will definitely be using this recipe from now on instead of buying pie crusts.  \r\n\r\nA note to those who complained of the stickyness.  I find as long as you wet whatever tool you're pressing the crust into the pan with (be it spoon, spatula or hands), there isn't a problem.  I dip a spoon in water and then press the crust into the pan and have no problems with stickyness.",
