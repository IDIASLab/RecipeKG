I also only put in 1/4 cup of oil to reduce the fat content, especially since I used peanuts.  Other then that I followed the recipe pretty close and found that it actually makes 4 cups (before being cooked) so I divided it into four different containers, baked one and froze the other three.  After baking let it cool to room temp and it can be shaped into a ball or log for a nice presentation, sprinkle top with dried parsley and paprika too.  Next time I will add some cayenne pepper for a little extra zip.  Thanks for the recipe!",

In Quebec torula yeast is fairly common but in the states people in stores look quizzically at you when you ask for it. Some Asian markets carry it. If you can't find it look for a primary yeast grown on molasses for the best flavor.",
