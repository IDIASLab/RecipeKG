The black pepper and cumin gives a nice edge to counter the softness of the potatoes and tenderized vegetables, I think, without being too spicy. You can also use half-and-half or cream instead of water, and add 1/4 cup flour if you want a creamier broth.",

I always have cream of mushroom and cream of celery in my pantry however this time I only had cream of chicken so I used two cans of that. I lessened the amount of pepper by half and it still was peppery and didn't have the dry mustard that I thought I did so didn't get to use that. All in all it was a good dish however I'm sure it would have been better if I were to follow the recipe exactly. The cumin was the star of this show.",

It has a different/odd combination of herbs and I was a little leery but found they went together well. 1 T. is a lot of cumin and I cut back on it at first but then added the rest and liked it in the stew. Also put only 1 1/2 t. of pepper in and that was plenty for us. Don't think we could have eaten it with the 1 T. called for in the recipe.",
