This gives wonderful flavored batter but still allows the meat to remain the central focus. I used this modification on alligator bites in our concession trailer with lots of compliments.",

After halving the recipe we toned down the lemon pepper cayenne pepper and skipped the black pepper (because lemon pepper has black pepper in it already). It still had great flavor and a little kick to it. The cumin adds a fantastic flavor. Also ended up adding the beer until the batter had a nice consistency so we used less than the recipe called for.
