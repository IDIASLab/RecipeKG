I suggest using this as a basis and adapting to suit with the addition of various peppers, sauces, spices, etc. The true beauty of this recipe is that it can be made in a pressure cooker in about an hour. Serve in corn or flour tortillas.",

                "reviewBody": "This is so yummy and quick in the pressure cooker.  I bought a pork shoulder at costco that was about 15 pounds of boneless meat.  It looks like one large roast but it was actually 2 large, floppy, pieces once I opened the package.  For a party I made the Sweet & Savory Pulled Pork recipe, from this sight, in the slow cooker.  It was delicious and a hit but I only used about half of the pork.  It made a lot and I still had this huge amount of uncooked roast left and wanted something other than BBQ.  I found this recipe, with no reviews, but pressure cooker instructions.  I doubled all the spices, and used a whole onion because I had at least 6 pounds of meat but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  This was amazing.  I put the shredded meat in soft, steamed, corn tortillas with cilantro and lime juice.  And with left overs we had crunchy tacos with shredded cabbage, lime juice and cilantro.  ***The only thing that would have made it even better would have been if I cut the roast up a little, like 2-3 chunks because there was one big piece of the pork that didn't get as fall apart tender in one hour in the pressure cooker.  I'm sure it would have been perfect if the roast was only 3 1/2 pounds.  Yummmmmm!",

I even shredded the meat and let it sit in the broth (which was very flavorful) for 3 or 4 hours.  Needed a lot of extras on top to make a good meal.  Thanks for posting though.  Forgot to say that I used the meat for sopes (please see my picture) rather than tacos but I don't think that this would make any difference",
