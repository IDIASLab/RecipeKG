I used all light/reduced fat ingredients and opted for the rice wine vinegar vs. the lemon juice as it's a bit on the sweeter side. I did add a bit more buttermilk and this definitely needed some fresh chives and dill - a generous helping at that. I let everything set in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors blend. In the end with those additions it's a really nice salad dressing to top mixed greens and grilled chicken!",

I left it out completely.  So glad I did.  I also knew this would be too thick for me so I doubled the buttermilk.  Perfect.  Finally, I knew this dressing would need a serious flavor boost \u2013 so I added fresh chives, dill and parsley.  What started out as a rather mediocre, too acidic dressing became elevated to five stars.  Skip the lemon or vinegar, give it a burst of flavor with some herbs, and thin as necessary with additional buttermilk.",
