Just a suggestion for prep -- there's no need to marinate in two steps, just combine everything in one glass bowl (plastic absorbs smell) or Ziploc bag overnight. If you don't have a dehydrator, you can use skewers and hang them from one end in the oven at 150F for 4-5 hours. I also boil the leftover marinade for at least 10 min to rid of bacteria or until desired consistency and use it for BBQ sauce on beef, chicken or pork. Why waste it? Everyone loves this jerky, so it's the only one I make. Great recipe! :)",

I used the recommended conversion amount for the sweet & low. I also used low sodium soy sauce - but ran a little short on the amount. I use Wright's liquid smoke - and it's really REALLY strong so I only used about half the amount. I substituted Penzey's Spices Black & Red Spice (black pepper & spicy cayenne blend) for some of the pepper too. Results? Amazing! The fake brown sugar worked really well the smokey flavor is definitely there and the Black & Red Spice gives it an added kick. Can't forget the pepper flakes! Definitely will make this again and can't wait to share this with my friends!",

Necessary changes: marinate at least 24 hours in the fridge, and use too much marinade (too little will leave too little flavor). A few options to try: cut the meat cross-grain (this allows for tenderness and flavor soaking), use reduced sodium soy, gourmet teriyaki (make sure it contains some type of wine), use any lean cut of meat (typically some kind of round/top round), and finally the pepper flakes and spices should coat the meat before marinating.",
