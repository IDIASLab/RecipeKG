So if you like your Chinese food spicy, throw in a tablespoon of red pepper.  Also, if you don't like so much sweet cut the brown sugar in half. I did not have Chinese five-spice powder but is easy enough to make if you have the ingredients in your kitchen, and it a must. Will be making this on a regular basis.",
