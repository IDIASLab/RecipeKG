That's very rare in my family especially since we always eat the same things (chicken, pasta, etc.) I made some changed to the recipe though. I didn't have lime juice or rum so i used lemon juice and tequila. I also put on the spices the night before and put it into the fridge so it could \"marinate\" sorta. and I put the spices underneath the skin (i did this by pulling some of the skin from the breast and put the spices under there and rubbed) so the taste would be amazing! Before i even into the oven, i put even more of the same spices on! I basted it for the time it said then i turned the temperature up to 450 so the skin could be crispy. \nBOY! this was delicious! I've made it two times and my family LOVES it!!!\nI think it would be great with cooked carrots with a touch of lemon on them and some white rice. yumm!!\nThanks for the recipe.",
