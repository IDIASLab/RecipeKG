Next time I might cut down on the paprika or use smoked paprika for a sweet 'n' smokey version. Although this is meant as a rub I think next time I'll add this to burger meat to punch up regular old burgers - adding about 1 Tbsp. of this for every 1lb. of burger meat. Thanks for the great recipe FTFF! UPDATE: I just couldn't resist trying this with hamburgers so my husband and I made some for lunch and OMG this stuff works wonders! I used a Tbsp. and a half for a little over a pound of ground beef. The burgers came out sensational - moist juicy with just the right amount of spiciness. We had them on toasted rolls and they really didn't even need anything more than that. These are definitely going on our list of things to make for our annual July 4th bash!",

Three tbsp. of this mix was perfect for a whole family package of chicken legs. My husband BBQ'ed them and they turned out great. I know I altered it a bit but I had to for my kids.
