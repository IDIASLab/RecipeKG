Thanks for a fantastic recipe! Alterations: I didn't have celery green beans or mushrooms on hand but it was still good. I did have 1/2 cup dry lentils so I threw them in at the same time as the potatoes to add heartiness since I was missing some ingredients. I also added some salt--not sure how much as I did it to taste but it was quite a bit. The soup was quite spicy so I added a little milk to the kids' bowls after I served it which also helped with the temperature for them. Hubby and I ate it and lived it full strength.",

The broth is excellent and the trio of dill thyme and rosemary works wonderfully in this recipe. A few tweaks I used about 1/2 lb hot italian sausage browned and removed from the pot to be added back later. I just eyeballed the amount of veggies and probably ended up doubling most. I sauteed the sliced mushroom with the onion/celery/carrot mix sauteed in the sausage drippings and used low sodium chicken broth about 8 cups total. I also used a bit more heavy cream and celery salt to season. A nice summer-into-fall soup! Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.",
