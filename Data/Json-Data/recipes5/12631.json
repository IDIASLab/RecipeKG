My suggestions....use the carbonated water in the recipe for the ice cubes. I decorated my cubes with thin lime slices and mint leaves. Made 2 trays of cubes and put one in each globlet I served. It fizzed immediately in the glass to the \"oohs\" and \"ahhhs\" of guests. My wine was a $10 bottle of reisling, not great solo, but in the punch it was perfect. I also used inexpensive champagne called Seaview (from Australia) at $10 a bottle. This champagne was rated above Moet & Chandon's White Star in a recent review and was perfect for the punch. A beautiful recipe all around. Thanks!",

I stretched the second batch further by using an extra can of cranberry concentrate and an extra bottle of champaign. I used a white riesling wine to offset the sour flavors of the citrus juices and it worked great. I wouldn't waste money on expensive alcohol; the cheap stuff doesn't taste nasty when mixed with the juice concentrate. I would serve this again without a doubt.",

In fact there was a variety of drinks available including mimosas and this drink was the most sought after.

I kept everything else as listed in the ingredients list. You won't need the suggested half cup of sugar if you go with a Riesling but you will if you use a regular white wine. I stuck with club soda instead of gingerale and it was perfect!! You will definitely have many people asking for the recipe!!!!!!!!!!
