So I substituted an 8 oz package of fresh mushrooms and used a can of cream of mushroom soup. I did not add all the cayenne pepper because my 91 year old dad doesn't like a lot of spice but otherwise I followed it to a T. I did use smoked turkey and broth from that turkey so it was super smokey and sooooo delicious!",
