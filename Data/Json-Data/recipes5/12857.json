Maybe it is just because our tastebuds are not accustomed to the flavor.   I felt like I had (wrongly) combined leftovers from 2 different meals - fajita meat combined with macaroni and cheese.  I will keep checking the reviews on this because I am curious as to whether I did something wrong or if others agree with me.  Sorry, we just did not like it and our kids would not touch it.",

Either way if you lift them out of the pan with a slotted spoon and let them rest on some paper towel for a few minutes you should get rid of a lot of the grease. I agree that the loose sausage meat might make the texture a bit strange. I've always used sausage slices and everyone seems to like it kids and adults alike!",
