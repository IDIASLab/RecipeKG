                "reviewBody": "I really didn't know what to expect with this recipe, but it was good! The only thing I did different was add a little cream cheese to the filling for the kiddo. We tasted it before that and it is great as-is. My three-year-old ate an entire serving which makes this 5 stars based on that alone. May not be a favorite for those who aren't fans of sour cream, but we really enjoyed it!! I will experiment with it a little going forward. We suspect chicken would be great in place of the ground beef, and we will top with chopped veggies next time. \n----> Edit to add: This recipe does make enough filling to create another pan for the freezer. I didn't assemble the second pan the first night. Instead, I froze the filling alone. My family requested these enchiladas again, the very next night. I defrosted the filling partially in the microwave, then put it in a large pot and heated on low until it was totally thawed. I added whole kernal corn to really bulk it up and about half cup additional cheese. I filled each tortilla with a generous half-cup of filling each and was able to get 6 enchiladas in a pan both nights I made this. I swapped out the cheddar for a blend: Monterey Jack, Cheddar, Queso Quesadilla & Asadero cheeses. The last five minutes of cook time, I topped with fresh onion, olives, and tomato. Yummy! This was great!! It really is VERY versatile, and I maintain that chicken would be a fantastic alternative to beef. I would consider fajita beans in place of refries also!",

                "reviewBody": "(This is my first time reviewing/commenting!) We LOVE this recipe and I love Allrecipes because I can read peoples feedback and suggestions/changes that they like to do. That being the case, I wanted to share what I like to do with this recipe! I make it slightly different each time with one or all of these changes. First, I always do this recipe casserole style because I can't stand rolling enchiladas(personal problem!), and always I use corn tortillas. I find flour gets a little soggy and if you are trying to go gluten-free, this will solve the tortilla problem. Here are the other things I do: I usually use ground turkey instead of beef. Only because I have it on hand more than beef. Sometimes I use quinoa instead of rice. I double the beans and use whole beans, using either pinto, black, or a mix. Sometimes I add a can of chilies and sometimes I use \"hot\" taco seasoning. After my first time making it I found the onions to be a bit crunchy so I either cook them with the meat or pre-cook them on the side in the microwave or in a pan. To bake, I spray the bottom of a 9x11 pan then put a layer of corn tortillas (takes 5, 3 of which I cut in half to put the straight side on the edges), 1/2 the meat mix, 2/3 of the sauce/sour cream mix, another layer of tortillas, remaining meat mix, remaining sauce mix, all shredded cheese. Baking time is just a little longer. Then top how you like (olives, green onions, tomatoes, cilantro, etc.). Enjoy!!",

I had a small container of left-over flavored rice so I used it instead of white rice. When I read the other review I saw that she mentioned corn and I had a small container of left-over corn so in it went with the rice and meat. Instead of the sour cream I had a container of Ranch sour cream dip which I substituted. Don't be afraid of the cottage cheese--no one in my family tasted it and I couldn't tell it was there either. Everything else I followed by the recipe. It did make a lot of enchiladas--I think I actually used 15 tortillas. Mine were more like burritos with the rice corn beans meat and cheese. Next time I will not put in the refried beans but serve them as a side dish. I will make these again. Yummy!",

I think that for my taste the filling was too busy (too much going on between the tastes of the rice beans meat and cottage cheese).
