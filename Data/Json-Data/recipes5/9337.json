They're delicious served with a simple broth and have a silky, savory edamame filling inside. They are time consuming, but relatively easy to make. You can make them ahead of time and freeze them for future use. The dumplings are meant to be steamed or boiled but taste great deep fried as well. Garnish with sesame oil, sesame seeds, and sliced green onion.",

He said they were pretty darn good and ate 5 himself. We didn't use any dipping sauce just the bouillon. I did make some minor changes to make it a little more healthy. I changed the sour cream for fat free cottage cheese with 1 TBS. lemon juice and 1/6 cup of fat free milk. I used canola oil since I had not olive oil. I also added more garlic more lemon and more green onions as we like all those flavors. Overall a great start to using edamame and to ravioli.",
