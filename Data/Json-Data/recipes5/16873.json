It doesn't taste bad at all but when you are expecting a cheesecake and that's not what it is it's a little off-putting and so I couldn't appreciate the taste fully.

Everyone who had it loved it and wanted the recipe. personal preferences that worked: I used 3/4 cup pecan halves (instead of 1/2 cup chopped pecans this made it prettier but possibly harder to cut) and added a couple of tablespoons of pure maple syrup for the topping. I also used a low-fat crust and low-fat cream cheese.",
