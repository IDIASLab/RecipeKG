Nice flavor and pretty on a plate but with so many other recipes out there I'm not sure I'd try one again that I wasn't entirely pleased with.",

For my oven (always a little cooler I guess) I baked it 1hr 10min. My apples still looked wonderful. CHANGES: Added 1 Tbsp lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture(maybe a little more) and increased pecans in the topping to 1 cup (also maybe a little more.) We love pecans in Texas! The 3 textures--creamy filling chewy apples and crunchy nuts make this desert heavenly. And using the foil as a liner to lift it out was really easy. Everyone at my DH office that tried it asked for the recipe. I didn't want to type it over for them. So I looked on AllRecipes. Yeah! It was here. Thanks for posting this winner for us lazy recipe hounds!",
