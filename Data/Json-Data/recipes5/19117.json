I put it all into a slow cooker on high for a few hours then used hand held blender to puree. I added some cornstarch to try to thicken it up but that didnt work.

Flavor is good but the lemon flavor doesn't come through and I doubled the amount of limoncello. I cooked the pears with the skin on the pureed the whole pot with a hand blender. Worked really slick that way. I opted out of the almond extract and added vanilla extract and a vanilla bean to the mixture. But I did not add the extract or limoncello until it was good and thick because I felt it would be pointless and lost in evaporation. It was taking forever for it to thicken so I moved it to a shallow saute pan for more surface area. It still took well over two hours.",
