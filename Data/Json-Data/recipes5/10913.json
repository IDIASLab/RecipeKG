It does stick together well if you knead it adequately, which for me making a double recipe took 25 minutes by hand\n2. Rolling all the layers together only works if you put LOTS of starch between the layers, and it still takes a massive amount of time. The best result I got was putting each layer In a pasta machine, making paper thin,  and Drowning in olive oil between layers at the direction of my head chef (still took a long time to roll the layers paper thin)",
