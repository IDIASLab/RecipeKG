I did have to add a little more mayo (the warm pasta soaked it up) and omitted the hardboiled eggs (my husband doesn't like them) and the green onions. I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder as well after taste testing. I also added 3 stalks diced celery. This was a great lunch! (I didn't use quite as much edamame as called for because I had to shell mine and it was a pain it was a great addition though!)",

If we want it as a full meal I make it with grilled diced chicken but more times than not I use this as a standard macaroni salad and omit the chicken and edamame. It s always a huge hit! Also I use cubed Colby cheese (8oz block) instead of cheddar and typically more paprika and mayo. Such an awesome recipe!! Thank you!!!!!!",
