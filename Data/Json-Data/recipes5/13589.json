I doubled the oregano halved the salt added a smashed large garlic bulb added the same amount of chipotle and cayenne powders as the smoked paprika. I also marinated the wings for about an hour. I made the crema ahead of time so the flavors could meld. I added a lot to the sauce. I added a teaspoon each: oregano garlic chipotle cayenne onion; a whole avocado and red pepper leaving out the jalepeno. I didn't have one. I added a tablespoon of olive oil and 1/4 cup grated red onion. It came out great! A keeper in my home.",

The chicken seasoning is perfect, and I scraped the bottom of the pan,after removing the chicken, and I ate that yummy stuff on a corn tortilla. Yee haaa. \n\nThe sauce! Oh, my...I am glad it made a lot because I made some Mexican red rice and put some extra sauce over it. Yummmm\n\nThis sauce is so good that I would use it as a salad dressing or a dipping sauce, or criminey! Eat it with a spoon! Delish. Would be good with Indian food as well.",
