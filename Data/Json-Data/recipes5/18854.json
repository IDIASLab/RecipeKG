We followed the directions and found ourselves with a very soupy batter thinking \"this can't be right at all.\" It simply didn't look like anything that could turn into a pancake. But we decided to try out one small one just to see how it cooked up and amazingly it did turn into a pancake. We did end up adding an extra tablespoon or two of flour to thicken it up slightly but our advice is still to not get too freaked out by a very thin batter.",

However, I found this recipe to be a perfect balance. My husband said they were the best pancakes he had ever had. I served mine topped with some warm, homemade applesauce.\n\nI doubled the recipe, with the only variance being that I added a little extra salt to make up for the lack of it in my natural peanut butter, added a little extra vanilla, and substituted whole wheat flour for half of the all purpose. \n\nCutting the peanut butter into the dry ingredients was a clever method of incorporating it evenly. Although some reviewers suggested mashing the banana, I am glad I chose to chop them into extra small pieces as more per the recipe. The little bites of banana added some bursts of moist, flavorful goodness that made for a nice contrast with the peanut flavored pancake.\n\nI had no issues with it seeming too watery nor did the banana chunks sink to the bottom as another reviewer mentioned.",
