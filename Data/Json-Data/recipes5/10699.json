I did use half the amount of lemon juice called for and am glad I did because 1/4 cup would have been way too tart for us. Taste wise, we didn't care for the tarragon in this sauce to go with the fish. We aren't fans of black licorice though, but have had other tarragon sauces and enjoyed them. I don't think the amount of tarragon is too much and that it's simply just a taste issue for us. Next time I'll follow this technique and use a different herb. Overall, the sauce was ok and flavors seemed balanced, but that amount of lemon juice would be overpowering and neither of us enjoyed the use of tarragon in the sauce.",
