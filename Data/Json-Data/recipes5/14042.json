Fish tacos are good, but I forgot how wonderful Texas tastes.\r\nA well thought out recipe.\r\nExcellent texture, taste and heat.\r\nI used 10 chipolte peppers in adobe sauce from a can.  This saved the entire first step. I just used 10 not the whole can and it was perfect.  \r\nI also added 2 extra cans of diced tomatoes.  I prefer my chili a bit soupy since most thicken later.\r\nI only used 1 large yellow onion. I also added some red and green bell peppers\r\nI really felt like I was building a great tasting chili right from the get go.  I loved the extra touch of carmalizing the tomato paste.

My chile has always been -well chili. This is CHILI. I've never used dried peppers before. No problem finding them but only 5 in a bag and with cost in mind I bought only one bag. That amount was actually perfect for my family. I used the internet to define how to make the ancho paste and then winged it because recipe does not clarify for neophite dried pepper users whether to put the liquid the peppers soaked in in the food processor along with the peppers to make the paste. I made quite a mess doing it too but that will go better next time now that I've done it once. I got 1 lb less italian sausage and when I got home from the grocery store discovered that I had picked up a pkg of hot and a pkg of mild which actually turned out to be excellent. I don't use a lot of sausage of any kind and was afraid it's flavor would overwhelm everything else it doesn't. I agree with others that 1/4 cup of honey is perfect. My husband said this is the best chili he's ever had. My daughter's fiance said he doesn't care for chili therefore doesn't eat it often but he liked this very much and says when I make it again not to change a thing. Lon you made me into a chili artist. Thanks",

I cut the honey down to 1/4 cup I also substituted a cup of strong coffee and a bottle of dark beer (a porter) for the wine as I don't think wine has any business in something as earthy as chili and as the recipe was becoming a bit too thick.

Adaptations: Instead of using dried ancho chilies I took the advice of another reviewer on here and used chipoltes is adobe sauce. I used about 5oz of a 7oz can. But you may want to start with half a can and see how you like the heat then add more of the can. I did still blend the chipoltes. Instead of wine I used beer. About 16 oz of a dark beer was used vs only 8oz of wine. I cut out a bit of the meat (about 3/4 lb) as it was pretty heavy meat. I added 2 tbsp cocoa powder I added full cup of honey vs half cup I added some water (1/2 cup) The recipe can be pretty hefty on thickness so I added some liquid (beer water etc and added some extra diced tomatoes). This adaptation turned out really well. Hope this helps! It had a nice warm sweet front taste with a dark beer warm heat on the back end. Excellent!",

                "reviewBody": "This is the best chili I have ever tasted. One of 17 entries in my office's Annual Chili Cook-off and got voted first place. Don't let the term \"sweet\" throw you. The sweet is very subtle and only one of the many layers of flavors. The \"serves 12\" recipe makes about 6 quarts. I made a half-recipe and added 2 (15 oz.) cans of diced tomatoes for a total of 4 quarts. Excellent recipe.",

I also thought it took way too long to prepare. If I'm going to spend an hour and a half preparing a dish it had better knock my socks off.",
