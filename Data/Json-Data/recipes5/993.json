Do NOT add any extra salt (other than what you put in the mashed potatoes when you made them).  It's got plenty of salt flavor from the ham & cream of mushroom soup.  The recipe doesn't have salt in it for a reason!  2. Go easy on the dry mustard--it's strong and has an after flavor if you're not used to it.  1/4 tsp. is sufficient (or just skip it). Other notes: I cooked raw carrots and field peas instead of using a bag of frozen veggies.  I sauteed 1/2 an onion & 1 clove garlic and mixed them in, too.",
