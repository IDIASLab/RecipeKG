While it isn't exactly like what I was looking for it is really good. I followed the recipe as written but substituted Dreyer's Grand Light in a flavor called Caramel Delight. It's an easy way to cut the fat and calories. I didn't use any caramel topping. It didn't need it. After a few hours in the freezer it cut well into squares. It was even more nicely set up the following day. My kids gobbled this up.",
