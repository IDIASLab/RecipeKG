Made this in the Instant Pot and you taste layer upon layer of interesting flavors.  Garnished with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro.",

And I used a small handful of whole baby carrots and 5 small (peeled/forked) potatoes (instead of 2 carrots and 2 large potatoes) as that's what I had on hand.",

I used brown rice since that is what I had on hand which increased the period under pressure to 15 minutes.  Next time, I will try to have white rice available since the additional time under pressure made the carrots a trifle too mushy.   I also included a chopped up block of paneer which added some yummy meatiness.  I will make this recipe again and again.",
