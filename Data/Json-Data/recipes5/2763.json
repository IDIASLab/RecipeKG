I bought pre made graham cracker crusts,and a few different varieties of toppings, and was able to whip this up in batches in my food processor in about 20 minutes.  I stuck them in the fridge for about 12 hours, and I had a dessert that everybody thought I  slaved over and looked and tasted great! I'm wondering if people may have decreased the lemon juice. This is an integral part to the taste and the consistency of this cheesecake. It takes care of that sweetened condensed milk taste too!!  Anyway, thanks LJ for an easy dessert!",
