I would have preferred to have cooked the meatballs in a separate pan first to get a good sear on the outside and then put the meatballs in the sauce for a while. Then the meatballs are less likely to meld into the soup/sauce. I would have also held back a little with the vegetable oil. I would have maybe added one or two tablespoons of oil instead of three. Lastly I would have added more chipotle peppers and garlic to the whole dish. My family prefers bold flavors. Otherwise this was a good recipe for Mexican food.",

It may have been the pork since I have not previously made meatballs with anything but beef. The meat mix was very wet and loose and the sauce was very thin. Regardless I was able to carefully form the balls and they cooked fine in the sauce without breaking apart. I am not sure they would have handled stacking and stirring so I only had room to cook half in a single layer. I baked the rest of the meatballs. The puree that mixes in with the meat has a pretty nice flavor that might do well in other dishes(minus the egg). I found this to be on the mild to medium heat side so I wouldn't shy away from the chipotles. Half a batch made forty meatballs.",
