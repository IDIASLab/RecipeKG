Sauciness not an issue for me, but using raw beans necessitated cooking much longer than 2-3 hours to achieve desired tenderness. I was surprised that originator did not factor in the tenderizing capacity of salt by including it from the start; I ended up using about 1 teaspoon total and added it during the simmer. Also, no meat made the finished product lack umami; my solution was to add one tsp. of wine vinegar, 1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire Sauce, and 1 tsp of a granular vegetarian Umami additive available at Trader Joe's.  (One final note - cooking rice at 2:1 ratio of water to grain makes for a mushy result, so I usually go for a 1:1 ratio or add just a bit more water to achieve the desired separation of grains. I will likely make this recipe again. It was easy to follow, well-documented, and yields a delicious result.",

If I make it again, I would probably at least double them. I didn't have any liquid smoke, so maybe that was part of the problem (otherwise I'd say it earned three stars - but I'm sure it would taste better with the liquid smoke). I did like the consistency. I didn't drain any water, and it was a little gooey without being soupy. In retrospect, it would have been good with fresh-baked bread on the side.",
