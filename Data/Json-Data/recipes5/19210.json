I also added 2 t vanilla after it cooled a little to give it a rich caramel flavor.   Make sure you cool the sauce before beating in the sugar, and like others have said, make this when you're ready to use it.  If it gets too thick, just beat it until it's usable.  The end result is a thick, wonderful icing that I used on a chocolate cake.",
