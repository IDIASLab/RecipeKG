I realized at some point the best part of the good coffees is the steamed milk anyway in my opinnion. I also used lite chocolate syrup to cut back a little on the sugar. I topped with a little lite whipped cream and a tad of syrup drizzled on. Some cocoa powder dusted on would probably be good to. I made another recipe this week and the milk was warmed in a pot on med-low and then whisked briefly with a hand whisk. It worked just as well without the battery operated whisk if you do not have one. Thanks!",

If cost isn't an issue go for a good chocolate sauce rather than a syrup like Fontana Torani or Ghiradelli chocolate sauce.",
