First, I added some cinnamon and madagascar vanilla to the cake batter for a little extra flavor. I only used 6Tbs of butter for the struesel topping and the consistency was perfect. I pour about 1/2-3/4 of the batter into a greased 9x13 pan. I then sprinkled 1/2 of the topping evenly over the batter. I dropped spoonfulls of the remaining batter over the topping. I made large circles with a knife to distribute the top batter and mix in the struesel topping (don't stir, just swirl a few times) I then topped with more topping. Baked for 30 minutes at 350 and did not use the drizzle of powdered sugar as it did not need it!! Great recipe!",

(Hubs had a couple of bites and left the rest on his plate. I didn't even get THAT far) Even substituting freshly squeezed orange juice for the water and adding a tablespoon of fresh orange zest and a teaspoon of vanilla didn't elevate this beyond a mediocre doctored up cake mix - and there are some doctored up cake mix recipes that are excellent! Also a mere 1/4 cup of oil left this a little dry. For those who are still interested I used a specialty Bundt pan which required only half of the the topping mixture. Because mine is a dark pan I lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees and it was baked perfectly at about 42 minutes. I drizzled it with a glaze of fresh orange juice and powdered sugar. The remaining streusel (and there was quite a bit leftover) I froze for later use to top muffins.",
