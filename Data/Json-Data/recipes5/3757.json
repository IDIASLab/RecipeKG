The erroneous information they gave certainly would result in a very bland product as they reviewed it. As the \"most helpful\" reviewer said....Coconut milk and cream of coconut are the same. Sorry...NOT even close. Two entirely different products. That being said I made it exactly as directed initially only adjusting the seasoning a bit before I served by adding about a half teaspoon of chili garlic sauce and another tablespoon of lemon juice. Next time I will skip the water and use chicken broth instead to add more depth and I will add some red curry paste too. I would also add some fresh ginger. I served this with fried broken rice and chopped peanuts and cilantro for garnish. Very tasty indeed. (though a bit heavy on the calories) For the adjustments I give this 4 stars. My husband and a dinner guest gave it 5 stars as served. Thanks so much for sharing a terrific recipe. This is a winner!",
