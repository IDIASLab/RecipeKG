Added the same amount of vegetables suggested just for one lamb chop. Left out the butter and cheese. Didn't take very long to cook. Served it over fresh sliced tomatoes. Cooked a 2nd pan of similar veggies in the leftover pan juices for my 2nd dinner. Equally delicious.",

I put the lamb on some sliced mushrooms, put some rosemary and salt on top, put on a pad of butter and sliced celery. Baked it and BAM, delicious lamb with a juicy sauce. Perfect for buttered noodles. I put the lamb on a bed of arugula and it was great! Even my 4 & 2 year old liked it!",
