We baste our ribs after we slow cook our baby back ribs for 4 hrs on low heat (250) with a cookie sheet full of water underneath the ribs - put ribs directly on oven rack. The key to take away the sweetness is to make sure you use a good spicy rub - rub ribs before you place them in the oven or rub them the night before. The spicier the better for the rub as the sweetness of the BBQ sauce totally compliments it. Also - make sure the BBQ sauce has cooled before using it - it goes on thicker.",

However tonight I was looking for something different to make for dinner and found this recipe. I made 1/2 batch of it and used it on boneless pork chops. Amazing! I changed a few things as per other reviewers' suggestions. For 1/2 batch I: cut the sugar in half using only a scant 1/2 cup; added 1/2 teaspoon of dried onion flakes; and added 1/4 teaspoon of Frank's Red Hot Sauce for heat. All of the other ingredients I left the same in the proportions as stated (for 1/2 batch). Next time I think I will cut the sugar even more probably use 1/3 cup. And I will add more Frank's Hot Sauce because my husband and I like our sauce to have a bit more of a kick. Overall this recipe is great and the texture from the applesauce is wonderful. I noticed right away that it does not have that \"chemically\" taste that bottled sauces have. Very fresh tangy and tasty--this will definitely become my standard barbeque sauce recipe!",
