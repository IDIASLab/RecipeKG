The should be HAAS. When you buy them at the store the skin shouldn't be too bumpy and soft to touch. Not too soft. Use them as soon as possible as avocados don't have a long shelf life at least the ones that are not hard as a rock. \n  \nAdding lime instead of lemon for flavor. It's probably a good call. But otherwise is that SIMPLE!\nKeep it that way for best results and if you don't like CILANTRO this is definitely not your recipe. What makes this recipe is the cilantro and green onions do not replace or exchange. \n\nThis recipe is supposed to be simple and without garlic. Those who add cumin, garlic or tomatoes need a different recipe. So don't go by the reviews too much is my experience. Funny you learn that when you submit your own recipe.",
