Now some comments I added to times back but I guess it went under a adapted version .. so did not show up ...\"Well actually I never wrote the chicken should be grilled when I transmitted the recipe, the Editor here at allrecipes.com took a few liberties i don't agree with . I would either poach the chicken or finish it in the oven i it gets to dry otherwise . And I would keep the chicken off the Couscous and don't sprinkle Dates on the CousCous ( gets to sweet.. ) and then the sauce needs to go on the chicken as well on the tomatoes and cucumbers ... ( Please see picture ) Just my original instructions , but you are free to try the editors way of doing it :-)\"\n\nFor the sweetness it is important to top it with the lime juice and as I said to season it , it should be a fine balance between sweet sour and savory flavor.",

My husband took a couple of bites of this dish and announced that I could put it on the weekly rota and he would happily eat it. And then he gobbled it all up! The only change I made was I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream because I had that in the fridge and it was cold and rainy and I didn't want to go out. I did neglect the sauce a bit and when I returned it had separated in a terrible gloppy mess but I just added some more 1/2 & 1/2 and stirred vigorously and it all settled down. Disaster averted! Served with a boxed Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil couscous and for veggie I followed recommendation and put my own twist: I sauteed green beans then 5 minutes before finishing I tossed in a handful of tomatoes cucumbers sliced Kalamta lives and some Spice Isalnds Greek Seasoning (great all-purpose spice for the pantry shelf) And for those who think cooked cucumbers sound yucky you haven't lived until you've had braised cucumbers but's that's another recipe. I highly recommend this recipe. Yum! (In fact I just had the leftovers from my plate---there were none from Husband's and Son's---for lunch. Nukes well!)",

It was such a hit! The sauce was a little thick and I wanted to ensure there was enough to go around so I ended up adding a little 2% milk. The combination of the rich mascarpone tart capers and sweet dates is decadent beyond measure. Everyone loved the sauce so much - even my vegetarian friend (we spooned it over eggplant meatballs for him). Try this one out!",

The sweetness was devine and original and perfectly paired with chicken. I made this exactly as directed by the chef and it was beautiful in presentation and very tasty. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the sweet sauce paired with the couscous. Too much sweetness. It would be better just over chicken with something on the side that is slightly salty like veggies or pasta. I baked the chicken with a little salt pepper and olive oil on it and that made the contrast between salty chicken and sweet sauce delicious! Also for those of you with a thick sauce. The recipe is perfect but you are letting it sit too long. Make sure it is on medium heat (no more) and just let the cheese melt into it. After it has melted wait maybe a half a minute to ensure it is hot then pour it over the dish.",

First I think there needs to be either more chicken or less of everything else. I would say double the chicken for this recipe. Also it begins to get too sweet and needs some side like a pasta salad of some sort as suggested in earlier reviews... something salty. Otherwise it's like eating too many cookies with no milk. Other than that it's a pretty interesting blend of flavors worth trying. I might make this every now and again but not often.",
