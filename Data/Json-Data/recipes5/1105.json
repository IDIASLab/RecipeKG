Insted, I just spooned  a couple tblsps of the basil pesto over each breast, and then topped them with nice big slices of good quality motzza. I covered the baking dish with foil, and baked them at 350 for about 20 mins. I then uncovered them, and baked them for about 5-10 mins longer, and that browned the cheese nicly, while still keeping the chicken SUPER moist and yummy. Will deffinetly do this again. Thanks for the good idea! :)",

And just a note to all: boneless chicken breast doesn't take long to cook.  I baked in 375 degree preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes.  That's all the time you need. Someone posted that they had to cook the meat almost an hour. I'm trying to figure how the chicken breast can still be moist after baking that long.   Otherwise, this was very nice and if i don't feel like going through the hassle of rolling the chicken up...I just flattened with mallet....topped  (seasoned) breast with pesto then cheese and then topped with another flattened chicken breast.  Next I'll try with the jarred sundried tomato.",

The only suggestion I would make is seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper and after it is in the oven for about 15 minutes using a pastry brush and brushing the tops of the chicken rolls with the oils that ooze out of the rolls. The oils are garlic infused from the pesto and it give the chicken an amazing flavor and keeps it from drying out. YUM!",
