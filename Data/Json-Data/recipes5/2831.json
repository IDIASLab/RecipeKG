I love peanut butter pies have had them before... and I think what makes this recipe too rich is the cream cheese and the sweetened condensed milk. I think if it were lighter and fluffier and didn't have those ingredients it would be much better suited for my tastes. Thanks for posting either way I was pumped to try it!",
