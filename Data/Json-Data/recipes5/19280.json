I also heard from another reviewer that the juices didn't absorb as well...but then I break all the meat apart and make it like pulled pork.\n\nI like a lot of sauce so I double or triple what's above because I like the sauce to be all around the meat while it's cooking. Or at least half way up the tenderloins. I do constantly spoon the liquid over, but you don't have too - esp if you make more liquid. I really go heavy on the teriyaki sauce! Basically, I used a large mixing bowl and filled it about half way full of stuff!\n\nCooking time - I was in a hurry the other day, so I cooked on high for three hours, maybe longer - just long enough to where when I took my fork I could tell the meat would shred easily. Then I removed about half of the liquid, and then shredded the meat. I did end up putting some of it back it, cuz like I said, I like sauce and I used enough to coat the meat + a little more. Then I cooked it on low for about an hour - but not too much longer as the meat is SOOO tender by this point. I have cooked it on low for the full 8 hours too, but still waiting to shred the meat until the last hour or so.\n\nIngredient alterations - the first time I used this, I used honey teriyaki, but just got regular stuff this time, and added 1/4 cup of honey. Also, I don't use fresh red chile pepper but will add touch of red pepper and some creole seasoning. The BEST is Tony Chacherie's original Creole Seasoning",

What I love most about this dish is it is so easy to make.  I just put the entire recipe in the slow cooker, set the time and it's ready in a few hours.  I cook mine LOW for 8 hours just to make sure it's really soft and tender.  I brown the pork if I have time but there are a few times where I didn't brown the pork and can honestly say, I can't tell the difference.  Also, when I bring this dish to any gathering I buy a least expensive cut of pork or what is on sale and I cubed the pork, about 1/2 an inch or less, so I don't have to slice it and it's easier for people to eat.  ***And if I want to bring want to bring up the recipe to a notch, you can add 1 sprig of fresh oregano, 1 bay leaf, and 2 star anise.  ***And if I want to influence the dish with my Asian heritage, I add 1-1/2 tablespoon salted black beans (tausi).",
