I did take the advice of others and tweak it a bit....I marinated the chicken all day in 2 tsp curry powder, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, black pepper and salt, then sauteed until just done and golden brown in skillet, removing chicken then  adding 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/4 cup of vidalia onion and a dash of olive oil.  When the onion was just translucent I added the chicken broth (which I increased to 1 1/2 cups per someone else's recommendation, we don't like crisp rice) and all other ingredients.  Near the end I added the chicken, cubed, back in along with an additional 1 tsp of curry, red pepper flakes, a dash of cayenne for some heat (using Madras curry powder, not enough heat for us!) and the result was an absolute fantastic dish that my husband is still raving about.  The mangoes added a wonderful sweet tartness that went so well with the curry and slight pop from the cayenne.  I also added grated carrot and thawed frozen peas in the last 10 minutes or so which gave us a great, healthy meal in less than an hour, and only one dish to wash!!!  Please try this recipe, and Thank You! Linda!",

I did not have any wine on hand so I used ALIZE instead - a blend of natural passion fruit juices and cognac liquor. It really brought out the flavour of the mango.

I too saute'd onions and garlic ( left out the ginger because my curry already had sufficient heat ) and browned the chicken.

It was wonderful. I cubed my chicken as others suggested and also did the onion\\garlic\\ginger combo before hand. I also added more curry. Can't tell you how much because I don't measure but I would guess I doubled the amount called for. Oh I was about to forget the most amazing thing about this recipe.

Seeing other reviews I tried adding a little more flavor to it by sauteing some garlic and shallots in a little oil beforehand. I also covered the chicken in curry and seasonings. I thought the chicken turned out a little tough and next time I will cook it a few minutes shorter than the 20-25 minutes. (I also believe that if the chicken was marinated first and a little more seasonings were added to the rice for a little kick it would be a little tastier). All in all it's an easy meal that looks and tastes like you've spent more time on it. Thanks.",

In a skillet I cooked the chicken with some olive oil removed it and then added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and the rest of the ingredients. I substituted jasmine rice which needs more liquid so I increased the broth to one 14 ounce can and added equal amounts of water and wine as needed re-seasoning with curry S&P to taste to the additional liquid. I added the chicken and mango at the last minute to the pan just stirring to heat the chicken back up. I will definitely make this again.",

Also I usually enjoy mangoes but the broth gave them a salty-sweet taste which I didn't care for. Perhaps it would be better to cook the rice separate?",
