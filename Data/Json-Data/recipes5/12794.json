My dog biscuit cutter was small so I got 22 biscuits and the rest of the dough I cut with a regular biscuit cutter and got 10. 32 biscuits all together.. I read Always Hungry and Bren s reviews and liked what i read. I myself didn t find the dough to sticky but I did have to use some ground oats on my board. Thank you for the recipe.",

I couldn't roll them out because the dough stuck to the rolling pin I considered flouring the pin but that would have comprised the gluten-free factor.
