I also cooked the shrimp with the asparagus and onion after the asparagus was cooked.  One issue, do not put the cheese on until the last 10 or 15 minutes.  At such a high temperature, after an hour, the cheese will either burn or turn into a hard brown shell.  Not very pleasant.   The temperature is needed to cook the quiche right but leave the cheese to the very last moment.  Next time, I might not put the cottage cheese or eggs in the blender since the curds provide a nice texture.  Good recipe though thanks!",

Also, I had not read the reviews so put the montery-colby shredded cheese on top before it went into the oven and it was just fine.  Maybe the previous reviewer had an oven that was hotter than mine.  Also, I used 1/2 pound of jumbo shrimp cut in 3 pieces each and that was plenty.  For me this is a keeper.",
