If you want to make it fast, chop everything in a food processor, but you will not get the same texture as hand-chopped salsa. Also, if you want it spicy add a little chopped jalapeno. Last, you can use the juice from this pico de gallo to make a quick guacamole, just add some of the pico de gallo juice to the avocados, some extra salt, a little mayo, and your guacamole is ready!",

It is made hundreds of times each day for the family tables and Mexican food restaurants of south Texas. Some thoughts about the pica (bite)--add finely chopped seeded jalapeno or serrano or can also leave recipe as is but add a spoonful or two of a picante sauce Pace--made in San Antonio--is excellent. To make true Texas style--make plenty--you'll need to taste to add the chile you want. Allow it to sit so flavors can marry. Buen provecho.",

This a great base recipe to make as written or to tweak depending on your tastes. I'm a taster cook so I use what looks right and go from there. If 6 limes seem like too many try 2 or 3 and add from there. You can't go wrong with pico however you like it! This one's a keeper for me!",
