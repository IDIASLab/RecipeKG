The vegetables don't need to be finely diced; I just do a rough chop, since the pressure cooker ensures they'll be tender. I also added chunks of potatoes because I had a couple to use up. The flour-butter paste at the end is to thicken the broth and to add richness. Oh, and if you don't have buttermilk, regular milk is fine for the dumplings. I made this last batch using my stovetop pressure cooker, which is big enough for a 1.5x amount of dumplings. For the bigger batch, I just added more flour and buttermilk but kept the salt, baking powder, and butter amounts the same.",
