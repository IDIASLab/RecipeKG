I boiled 2 chicken breasts (whole) until cooked (just a few minutes) and then added them to everything else in the pot, minus the cornstarch mixture and the toppings.  Then, it all simmered merrily all day long.  Later, I shredded the chicken with a fork and added the cornstarch mixture, turning the temperature from low to high for the soup to thicken.  I served it with shredded cheese and cilantro, like it suggests, but also offered Greek yogurt which, when stirred in, makes the soup nice and creamy.  I normally do a lot of complex cooking, but we have a new baby (!) so this recipe of can-dumping simplicity was PERFECT for a busy weeknight dinner.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  Thanks!!  Oh, P.S.--I also dumped in a can of black beans.",

Not only is this delicious on it's own, you can add to, or take out, any of the ingredients that you may not have on hand and it will still come out AMAZING! I used home made chicken stock, some rotisserie chicken, a bag of frozen corn, a can of black beans, drained, and just went with it.   I did add in 3TBSP cornmeal that I mixed with water to use as my thickener instead of the cornstarch, to give it a nice corn background taste,and I also added in about 4 small corn tortillas that I cut into strips and just added into the mix.   I can only tell you that my husband can't stop eating it and neither can I!     When serving it, I put some corn tortilla chips and shredded cheese in the bowl, then added the soup on top of that.   I LOVE AVACADOS and since they were on sale here, I bought one and diced it up to add to the top of the soup.  I also added a dollop of Mexican crema to it, but my husband went with straight sour cream and LOVED IT!   It is truly HEAVEN on earth!    So good!   Thank you ladyw4kids!   Nice job!",
