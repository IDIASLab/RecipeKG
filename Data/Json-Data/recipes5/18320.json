But this is the only way I will make \"escalloped\" potatoes from now on. No dried up potatoes for me anymore. So creamy and flavorfull. My husband raved about these.

The first time I made this my boyfriend loved it and said \"I see this at Thanksgiving dinner...a nice change from traditional mashed potatoes\"! We both loved the sweetness of the onions by using the amount of brown sugar suggested. We wanted even more onion in it! The only thing I would say is to use regular salt and pepper when layering the potatoes. The seasoned salt is not as strong. I actually made these once with hot and sweet sausage for an Easter brunch. I won the title for \"Best Entree\".",
