I followed the recipe as written, except that I found med-high heat to be too hot. I grilled mine over low heat and turned often. After about 15 mins of grilling, I moved them over indirect heat and let them finish cooking while I grilled some meat.   The combination of flavors here is outstanding - you get a nice tang from the lime juice and wonderful chili flavor with the sweetness from the corn. A keeper!",
