The only changes I made were that I used chicken breast I'd boiled myself and cut up since I dislike canned meat and I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes rather than microwaved. It was okay. It turned out fine and we ate it and liked it well enough but it seemed to be missing something. My husband and I stirred in some salsa with ours and that helped a bit. I'll probably make this again but I'll add either some corn or black beans and something else for seasoning. I think a mixture of cheddar cheese and pepperjack cheese would be good. Overall a quick and basic recipe that just needs a little tweaking.",
