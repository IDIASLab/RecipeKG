Since my family would not want to be eating an entire green pepper I made these into stuffed cabbage. I sauted a finely chopped green pepper onion and garlic. Then I added the soy sauce wine and Worcestershire sauce. I increased the wine and soy sauce to 1/4 cup. I did not use the cranberries or pecans due to family preferences however I think they would be a great addition. I rolled the mixture in cabbage leaves and poured the tomato sauce on top and baked at 350 degrees for about an hour. They were very good. I had leftover mixture and it is great all by itself. All in all a tasty recipe no matter how you prepare it. Update: I have since made these exactly as the recipe is written (except increasing the soy sauce and sherry by an extra tablespoon each) and they are my favorite Vegetarian Stuffed Pepper!!! Love them!!!",

I was a little confused by the directions.

I choose to put the water in the dish and then the peppers in. The other thing I wasn't sure by the directions was how small to chop the tofu before placing it in with the soy sauce wine worcestershire sauce. I looked up another tofu stuffed pepper recipe online that called for dicing the tofu and decided to go that way which worked perfect.",

I used 'Dragonfly's Bulk Dry Uncheese Mix' (from vegweb.com) instead of parmesan added some parsley to the stuffing for color (fresh basil would be good too) & changed the cooking strategy a little but followed the recipe otherwise. I treated it as a make-ahead casserole: microwave-steamed the peppers 6 min mixed up the stuffing stuffed the peppers topped 'em with the tomato sauce mixture then covered & refrigerated overnight. Baked it covered 20 min at 350; uncovered it for another 10... delicious! A little bulky to eat; may experiment with stuffed zuchini next... or maybe quartered peppers... this would make a really pretty holiday casserole with red/ yellow/ green bell quarters stuffed & topped w/ fresh herbs.... hmmm... anyway: YUMMY! thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!! I'll definitely make it again!:-)",
