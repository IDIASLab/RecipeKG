A meaty, spicy, flavorful, turkey chili! You can quickly cook up the turkey and combine ingredients in slow cooker, throw in the fridge, and take it out to cook on low before you go to work - works perfectly, easy peasy! All the guys love it for football games, tailgating, and just plain old cold weather. From my table to yours, hope you enjoy! Serve with sour cream and cheese to your liking.",

The few things I didn't have, I will do next time!\" So I was out of chipotles in adobo, and I either mis-read the ingredient list, or maybe I was just plain OK w/ having used 3 small 4 oz. cans of diced green chiles. Used a small 8 oz. tomato sauce instead of tomato soup to avoid it possibly being too watery, as we like our chili thick-thick-thick. And I sauteed the onion (along w/ some minced garlic) as the turkey browned. Even w/o the adobo/chipotles, this was a fiery chili, but not so much that it killed any taste enjoyment. W/ cheese and Frito scoops, this was killer chili, and even better as leftovers the next day.",

The only hot spices I used were Bill Echols (Allrecipe member) Taco Seasoning recipe and 1/2 Tbsp Chilies in Adobe. I did not brown the meat- less or cook the onions. I put everything in the crock pot onion garlic meat beans added seasonings and stirred it up while crock pot was on high then I added the tomato sauce covered and cooked on low all day. It was perfectly thick and just spicy enough for my young crew.",
