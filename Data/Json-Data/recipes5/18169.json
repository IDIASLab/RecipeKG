I used a ziploc bag for the marinating process I didn't add any garlic powder but added 4 tablespoons of minced garlic I used a whole bottle of Guinness 1 TBSP of Soy Sauce 5 TBSP of brown sugar 1 TBSP on Worcestershire Sauce and a TBSP of black pepper. I didn't have any teryaki on hand which is why I used the soy sauce. We used a tri-tip and marinated it for about 10 hours. Threw it on the grill for about an hour and it was really tasty. My husband really liked this recipe. I think next time I'll through in a couple of jalapeno's during the marinating and some cayenne for a little heat.",
