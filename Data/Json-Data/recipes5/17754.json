I almost ended up with with scrambled eggs untill I waited for the syrup mixture to cool. I think next time I will just melt the butter on its own and proceed as with pecan pie; no need to heat the sugar mix. Also since I am fortunate to have access to real maple syrup I didn't use the artificial flavoring cut back brown sugar to 1/3 cup and still this was too sweet; I will eliminate the brown sugar altogether next time- but there will definately BE a next time- YUMMY!",
