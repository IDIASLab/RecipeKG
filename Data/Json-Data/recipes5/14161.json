It has no salt, and appeals to those unfamiliar with Caribbean food because of its authentic taste. The ingredient is vegetarian friendly and can be adapted to accommodate vegans. Adapt the ingredient amounts to suit your personal tastes.",

This had no flavor. I ended up putting some oil in a pan and cooking it down to take the bite out of the onion and garlic. I added cumin salt pepper bay leaf and oregano in order to get a similar flavor to what I was looking for. I understand the caribbean has a lot of islands and this mixture of vegetables seems more suited for flavors like allspice cumin and habaneros.",
