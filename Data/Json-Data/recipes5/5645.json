I decided to look up some recipes on here-ran across this one. Now i did almost everything different. All ingredients were used minus the tomato paste and plus a tomato. Now i marinated for six hours.  Then when it was time to brown the chicken i used peanut oil instead of olive. I put it on medium high. And sprinkled a little sugar to help Brown the chicken. After the chicken was really browned on both sides i dumped inn the cilantr Mixture and ALL of the marinade!!! Then i dumped in some turmeric and cumin!! Also added extra Salt and water. I simmered for close to an hour till the chicken was very very tender, almost falling off the bone but not quite. Then last minute dumped inn the yogurt and simmered another ten minutes. Served over rice!! Look this is the bomb.com If you like a lot of flavor...here is the recipe. Please don't waste the marinade. It tastes great added in.",

I had a bit of leftover fresh pesto that I had made yesterday and so into that I added the ginger lemon juice garlic a cup or so of fresh basil and there was some dill in the fridge so I added about a couple of tablespoons of dill and a tomato and blended the whole lot together. Marinated the chicken with this mixture for 10 minutes or so. Heated some veg oil and added the chicken (shaking off as much of the marinade as I could) and fried the drumsticks to seal the meat and then added the remainder of the marinade covered and cooked about 15 minutes. Lastly I added the yoghurt ( which I diluted with half a cup of water before adding) covered and simmered another 10 mins and voila! It was done and delicious!! This has possibly turned into a different recipe but the concept is the same. Thanks for a great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I followed the recipe pretty close and while it tasted good it has a strong tomato base that takes over the garlic and cilantro flavors. Not what I was expecting but still good flavor. I did skip the peppers and regretted it as this would have added more to a slightly bland tomato sauce the chicken cooked in. The name is misleading but I did enjoy the leftovers. This would be great with chicken thighs or breasts.",
