Like others have suggested I used 6 eggs and 1 and 1/2 cups of milk, and dredged the bread in the liquid before pouring the rest over.  Because it is apple season, I used some Granny Smith apples in place of the peaches and it was DELICIOUS!  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was VERY sweet and some may not care for that.  You definitely do not need syrup.  I think using the day-old bread is key to avoid the sogginess others have mentioned.",

I was a bit leery of the canned peaches, but one taste of the final product and those concerns evaporated. I soaked both sides of the bread prior to placing on top of peaches. Another minor alteration to the basic recipe that I made (because so many reviewers mentioned how sweet this dish is) was after draining I quickly ran water over the peaches to remove any excess syrup. I don't know if that actually altered the flavor (since this is the first, and only, time I've made this recipe) but it was plenty sweet and simply couldn't have been better. Even my husband, who is pretty stingy on the compliments, raved. Put this one in your recipe box. Oh so yummy.",

Don't let the overnight stay in the fridge scare you, I've done it both ways, the night before and morning of and they are both fantastic.  One time I even forgot the peaches and it was STILL Great!  I used a French baguette and slice it about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, and because we like it \"eggier\" I use 7 eggs (have even used egg substitute with success) and a dash more vanilla and a dash or two more of cinnamon. This is a great dish for overnight company, holiday brunches, and it's even been requested for dinner!  Today I made it and I had some peach brandy on hand and added about 3 tablespoons to the sugar & butter mixture while it was cooking. To DIE FOR.  Thanks for this new family favorite! I made it again for a brunch at work today and everyone RAVED and wanted the recipe.  I don't understand the reviews saying to add milk, I don't add ANY milk, it's not in the original recipe, I just add an extra egg or two and it's perfect.  Milk will make it soggy.",
