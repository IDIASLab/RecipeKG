Add cinnamon baking soda and baking powder. Add flour and stir until almost all flour is mixed in add chips and stir to combine.

                "reviewBody": "Great use of a wealth of bran cereal I was gifted. I bought a bunch of bags of Hershey's cinnamon chips right around Christmas and stuck what I didn't use in the deep freeze so I was able to make these without substitutions. I ended up making a half recipe of this--12 muffins. To make it a little healthier I used whole wheat white flour and cut the buttermilk by half and substituted homemade organic applesauce. I actually got exactly 12 muffins out of a half recipe of this--that almost never happens! 12 big muffins as a matter of fact. 350 degrees for 20 minutes and they were perfect. Good with the cinnamon chips but I think these would be just as good with dried fruit (like raisins) or even chopped apples. It's really a good base for you to play with and make healthier (if you so desire) or throw in whatever you may have on hand. NOTE: The recipe does not say to soak cereal in milk. I've made bran muffins before out of bran cereal and I've always had better results if I soak the cereal in the milk/liquid for about 10 minutes before adding in the other ingredients. If you soak it you won't have such an issue with wet batter too. I think using whole wheat white flour helped with that a bit too.",
