You can serve it to a family with thick consistency as a meal along with naan bread or crusty loaf (my kids ages 2-11 love it!) or serve it to grown-up friends along with a glass of wine! I think it's a very versatile and delicious dish.",

I did not have lemon grass or cilantro but squeezed a fresh seedless lemon into the soup; then split it open to place it on top of the soup. I added 2 cups of low salt chicken broth & a jalapeno. Also used low salt tomatoes. Even with the coconut milk its nutrition values were upper edge of reasonable within my personal targets. I expect my adjustments have made it even better. I will be making it often",
