The best thing about this recipe is that you really don't have to measure anything, and that is the way I like to cook! I cooked it at the firehouse and my crew went crazy for it. Here are the things I changed.  First, I grilled a whole onion and about a tablespoon of garlic in oil before putting the chicken in. I at least, if not more, doubled the salsa and also added several tablespoons of chipotle sauce for spiciness and flavour.  I tore up corn tortillas and made one layer on top of the first half of chicken mixture, then piled the rest on top, all in a pyrex bowl (we had no 9x13 baking dishes at the station, but I baked it in the bowl and it turned out perfect).  Also, next time I probably will not drain the beans and only some of the water off the corn. I served it with cornbread, a green salad and mexican rice. Soooo yummy.  My favorite recipe to date!!!!",

I followed advice and cooked up onions and garlic with the chicken, added more salsa and a can of green chilis, left the liquid in the beans and corn, and a cup of minute rice was mixed in right before I put it in the oven. I didn't have any chips, so I tore up a couple of tortillas, placed them over the casserole and added cheese to the top a few minutes before taking it out of the oven. They worked out great and came out nice and crispy. I also made the whole thing in a medium skillet (with metal handles) and put it right into the oven, making it a one-dish meal. Less cleaning is best in my book :)\r\nA great change from tacos, and was great at work for lunch the next day.",

Meals or salsa with black beans are considered on the gourmet end of our very basic love for spicy foods served traditionally with pinto beans and spanish rice.  As a matter of fact, my husband won't even consider ordering ANYTHING made with black beans.  Tonight I served him Sue's Mexican Casserole (he even watched as I added the beans) and not only did he have seconds, but he specifically asked me to make sure I make it again.  If it's dry you're either not adding enough water, adding too many chips, or cooking it too long.  Adios! from The Land of Enchantment!",

It could also use some additions to give it more character. But the thing that frustrated me the most is that a 9x13 pan is way too big for this. I could barely smear it around and cover the bottom. Ended up transferring to a 7x11 pan. Even there it was only about an inch in depth.",
