It takes a whole lot longer than 1 hour for the shrimp and scallops to \"cook\" in the lime juice and since I listened to this recipe they never fully finished since everything else was already added. This recipe might work if you get pre-cooked seafood, but if you don't then you have to soak the seafood overnight in just lime juice before adding everything else. The 1 hour is very misleading and inaccurate.",

To facilitate eating with chips, I chopped up the fish to about the size of a fingernail. We ate this with globs of sour cream and guacamole, and some people even took some home. \n\nI made wraps out of the leftovers for lunch and dinner today, and I still have leftovers!

Now the 2nd time I made this I chose to make it with 1/2lb scallops, 1lb hake Fillets, and 1/2lb redfish,  also doubled the amount of lime juice  (86'd the lemon juice) to fully cover the fish and let it sit for about 30 min while I prepared all the veggies (I split the amounts of veggies in half) and added a dash of cayenne pepper too. ; )  we like it Hot*    The lime juice \"cooking\" time was reduced to 1 hour 20 min and it was the best Ceviche we have had including our trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
