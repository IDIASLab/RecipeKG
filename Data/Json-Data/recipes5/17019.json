I used a miniature muffin tin to bake these and I did get more than 30 - but the more the better with these little gems!",

It just says muffin tins in the directions and never mentions mini.  You can certainly do either, but  I'm pretty sure that everyone who reviewed this and had an issue with the crust vs filling ratio being off made them as mini muffins.\n\nI made these in traditional muffin tins and they turned out perfect, I got 30, and I had the right amount of filling for the crust. The crust was flaky and buttery and the filling was delicious. Hope that helps.",
