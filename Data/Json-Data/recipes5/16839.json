                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe but I gave it a few tweaks.  I found the quantities for 24 made enough for 36.  I substituted butter for shortening (after all they are \"butter\" tarts!) and substituted 'golden syrup' for corn syrup which gives it an even more buttery flavour.  I also added an extra egg (for the 24 amount) making it three eggs instead of two, so they wouldn't be too runny.  I then baked them at 350 defrees F for approximately 20 minutes.  I also increased the butter and the golden syrup slightly.  I found they browned too much at 400 degrees because of the butter in them.  They turned out beautifully.  I have an excellent recipe handed down from my English/Scottish great grandmother, but it was hard to measure with the old weight measurements so combining this recipe with mine helped tremendously. Thank you.",

I cut back the raisins because 3/4 of a cup seemed like a lot. Next time, I'll follow the recipe. For a good tart shell I used \"Best Pie Crust Ever\" and cut circles with a plastic funnel. The tarts turned out tasting homemade and yummy. Some things are worth making yourself if the effort isn't too high, it doesn't take too long, and you get better than store-bought results. These tarts are a great example of this. Thanks, Priscilla, I'm hanging on to this recipe.",

I thought that no one in my house would really eat it and I might end up throwing some of it out since many people in my house are very health. They were so good that within 2 days they were all gone I will definitely try this recipe again.",
