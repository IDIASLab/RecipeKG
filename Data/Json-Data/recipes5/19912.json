Also could not find the Bonito flakes so I used Oyster Sauce that I found in the asain section. (I read online that was a good substitute) The sauce was delicious!! Make sure to cut the meat into small pcs so that it can soak up as much sauce as possible. Served w/white rice and steamed broccoli sugar snaps and baby carrots. MMMMmmmmm!",
