A delicious, refreshing salad made from shredded cabbage and a dressing made from lemon, garlic, olive oil, and cilantro. The proportions I listed will at least start you out with a dressing that's not too strong, but feel free to play around with them. This salad is more of an art than a science.",

Here's what I did to help make it more interesting after tasting the posted recipe: I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon of lemon pepper salt to taste and 1/2 t of Splenda to mellow things out. I'm planning to make it again and add some sliced or slivered almonds to make it more interesting. Thanks for posting this. It was an excellent place to start before adjusting it to our tastes.
