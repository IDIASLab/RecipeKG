I put it on everything from eggs to tacos, quesadillas, and salads. You can use any combination of chiles (cascabel, chipotle, Californian, New Mexican).   For a hotter sauce, you can use all hot New Mexico chiles or add a few dried arbol chiles.  For a tangier sauce, add the juice of 1 lime.",

I just read that you suggested an arbol chile for heat. I have those. I will have to make again to try with the arbols. Interesting sauce. Would like it a little thicker though. Going to play with the recipe now that I've tried it the way you posted it. Thanks for a nice hot sauce recipe.",
