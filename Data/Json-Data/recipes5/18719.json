Don't be afraid of the salt...but make sure not to marinate more than the 2 hours...slightly less if chops are very thin...this is NOT an overnight brine.",

I suppose that after marinating them for two hours the instructions should have said to discard the brine (probably second nature for experienced cooks). But when I pan-fried my first two chops I poured a bit of the brine into the pan. Bad mistake - it's not like sauteeing something in olive oil; the brine quickly turned black and burned awfully in the pan for the last half of the cooking time. After that I got rid of all of the brine leaving the moistened chops in my fridge. Unlike the experience of other reviewers I found that even cooking the chops as suggested (medium-high or 8/10 on my range's dial) the chops did indeed turned out juicy and moist - a pleasant surprise. The flavors of the brine were pretty interesting but the excess salt was a drawback. Should I have quickly rinsed the chops in water before cooking as another reviewer suggested? I may make this again and I'll try that if I do.",
