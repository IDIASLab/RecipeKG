After searching around the internet on how to make roux, I discovered it's not always the easiest thing to make.  When I tried again, I didn't cook it the full 15 mins as recipe says - I probably only cooked for 8 mins on medium (after having cooked on med-high for 3 mins).  Then, when I took off the burner to cool, I kept whisking for a while to ensure it didn't continue to cook without being stirred (running risk of burning).  So, for newbies like me, I would've appreciated more direction on how to make the roux.  But, I definitely still give the recipe 5 stars!!  It was SO good and is now a family favorite that we'll make often!",

It was easy enough to adapt to prep the night before so that I could throw it in the slow cooker in the morning before work. I put the chicken in uncooked so it cooked in the sauce to absorb the flavor. I used chciken stock instead of the water and used frozen cut okra in place of fresh because that's all that I could find. Also I subbed butter in place of the oil to make the roux (I don't feel that oil & flour could make a decent roux). This went over very well at work and was disappointed that there was none leftover to take home to my husband to try it. Definitely gonna make again!",
