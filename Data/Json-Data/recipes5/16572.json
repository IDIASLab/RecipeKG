If you're not a frosting fan (which I'm not) fear and anticipate about 3/8 of an inch on top of these bars. We added extra chocolate drizzle and some chopped peanuts to the top which was nice. But If i ever made these again I'd add something to the cookie base- like corn flakes or oatmeal. I'd definitely add some chocolate chips. The bars as a whole are pretty soft and smooth and could use a little textural variety.",
