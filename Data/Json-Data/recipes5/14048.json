I browned the bacon in a sauce pan then sauted the onion garlic and celery in the bacon juice. After this I followed the recipe exactly. I loved the way the apples smelled as they simmered in the red wine. This is definitely a nice complex soup and the flavours blend so well. It does come out thick and 'stewy' but I think that's how this soup should be. Thank you. I'll be making again and again.",

This one is my favorite. On to the soup: I was skeptical at first but as I prepared the recipe the aroma filled our home. My husband came inside and asked \"What's that divine aroma?\" It really is a deliciously different take on classic ingredients. I did a few things differently but not by much. Rather than discard the bacon grease I used it to saute' the onion and garlic. I puree'd the stewed tomatoes to give the soup a smooth consistency. I used dry sherry rather than red wine and I added 1 cup of half and half at the end to make it a creamy tomato soup. As you can tell this is not something you'll make every day. It is very very rich. But for special occasions it is wonderful. My husband loved it and so did our guests. I served it with smoky cheddar grilled cheese sandwiches. Wow! The variety of flavors will blow you away.",

But for the few customer who had a chance they loved it. The waitress' said that some of the customers were hestinatant because of the apple in the soup but were surpisingly happy when the eat it. I myself loved it! and make it every year for thanksgivving and christmas to shake thehunger pain when waiting for the turkey to be cooked. My family loves it too.

We all ate our servings but no one went back for seconds and no one wanted to save the leftovers. Thanks for sharing your recipe. I've been wanting to make this for quite some time and I'm glad I finally did. Try it for yourself.",
