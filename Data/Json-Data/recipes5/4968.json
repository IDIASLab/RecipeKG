I added some asparagus just 'cause I had it and I left out the additional oil figuring the alfredo sauce was oily enough on its own. I used dried rosemary so I only used a teaspoon. Left out the klamatas but sprinkled some feta on the top about 5 min. before it was done. Nice & garlicky and the lemon juice really added great zing to it. I used frozen chicken chunks - next time I'll thaw and drain them beforehand - it made the sauce kinda watery.",

I followed the directions to a T and when I went to serve it the chicken was almost completely raw. I even licked the spoon before realizing this!! I had to cook it a straight hour longer before I was sure the chicken was done. By that time the chicken was very tough... I'm sure if I had cooked the chicken before and cut it up it would have cooked very nicely with the sauce and flavors. The sauce was wonderful. It could definitely use MORE olives MORE potatoes MORE Tomatoes and LESS rosemary. I ended up sprinkling it with feta cheese and that was a delightful addition. I will be making this again but with these adjustments.",
