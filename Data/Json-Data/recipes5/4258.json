I was a little suspicious of 1/2 cup flour for the roux, but it turned out wonderfully, I added a total of 8 cups of chicken stock and a little extra pinch of each herb.  Don't skip the tarragon, it adds a wonderful dimension to this chowder.  Because of all of the flour, the lemon and wine are very important to giving this a tang, again, don't skip them.  I used smoked salmon from our local gourmet store.  The rich arroma this fills the house with!  This would be terrific for the holidays!  I topped with shredded cheddar, and served with cheddar/garlic biscuits.  Sincere thanks for sharing! A definite keeper.",
