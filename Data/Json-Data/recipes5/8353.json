I used produce I had just harvested from my garden, but you can change up the vegetables based on what you have on hand! If you're not avoiding dairy, feta cheese would be a great addition.",

Full disclosure, I didn't have sherry vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar instead.  That wasn't the issue with the actual pasta.  Will make again with regular pasta shells.",
