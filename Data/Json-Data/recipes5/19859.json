I think next time I will use less (if any) of the canned syrups and maybe use some maple syrup instead b/c I was hoping that it woiuld be a bit sweeter. All in all this was a nice quick side and everyone at the dinner table enjoyed it (including my sweet potato hating hubby lol). I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
