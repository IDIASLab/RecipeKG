The aroma was wonderful! We could only imagine how the other 2 would be after marinating overnight! We grilled them for brunch and OMG! The steak was tender juicy and so flavorful! I thin the liquid smoke helps so don't leave it out! I varied a tad from the recipe because I didn't have grape seed oil I used olive oil. I also ran low on Worcestershire sauce so only had little over 1/4c and lastly I used a whole lime otherwise would have had to find another recipe to use up the rest of it. I am adding this to my recipe box and will use it over and over! Thanks!",
