I cut up a sirloin steak in small pieces instead of ground turkey and used milder Rotel instead of diced tomatoes. Since I used Rotel I added a little tomato paste and water instead of salsa. Lastly I used American cheese in the layers then in the last 10 minutes I added a thin layer of salsa and a triple cheddar blend cheese. Very similar to an enchilada casserole I have made, but SO MUCH better with Polenta!!!!",
