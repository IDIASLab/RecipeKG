I made this exactly as stated only I reduced the oil for the pan to about 3Tbs for 3 filets. I seared the flesh side down first than turned over to the skin side down and got a beautiful crust. I layed them out on paper towels to absorb most of the oil. This helps bring the calories down without losing any flavor. Perfect flavoring not too spicy or salty.",

I used fresh caught catfish and cut it in fairly thin small pieces so that it would get good and crispy. We enjoyed this and it was a nice change from the regular cornmeal/flour breading. I used the pink chile sauce for dipping and it paired perfectly with this. Great recipe but I highly recommend omitting the salt. There was plenty between the two sauces the fish gets marinated in.",
