You need to really like yogurt to enjoy this (and I do) because the tangy yogurt flavor dominates over the oats and even the blueberries.  This really is more like \u201cyogurt with oats\u201d instead of \u201coats with yogurt.\u201d  If I make this again, I definitely would add more oats.  Also, this is a huge serving for one person, and more realistically, it serves two (at least IMO).  I like all of the ingredients in this recipe, but the proportions will need to be modified a bit for my taste preference.  Thanks for the recipe.",
