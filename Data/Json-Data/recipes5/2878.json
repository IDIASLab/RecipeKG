I would make it again for sure, but I would probably put in fresh mandarin oranges, because they fell apart, and I would put in less juice from the fruit cocktail in the cream cheese mixture.  The recipe wasn't specific, so I may have put in too much, thinking \"this seems a little thick and more seems to be making it creamier.\"  The salad was a little on the watery side (that could have resulted from the canned mandarin oranges too).",
