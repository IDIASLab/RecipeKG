The first time I followed the refridgerator cooling time exactly but the second time I tried only keeping the dough in the fridge for an hour or so and ya know what? It came out exactly the same! I though four hours had seemed a wee bit too long and it was. Same results same taste in way less than half the time! I do add two cups of brown sugar however because I'm a brown sugar junkie and a flavor of brown sugar lessens so much after baking with it so two cups seems to be satisfactory. I know it seems like a lot of sugar but it's soooooo yummy. Also try adding chocolate chips for some really yummy choco-chip cookies!",

I like things not tooo sweet but these tasted too \"healthy\" - double the brown sugar and use TWO pinches of salt to bring out the flavor.
