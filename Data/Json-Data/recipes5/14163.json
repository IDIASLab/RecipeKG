I turned the heat down even though this is not included in the directions. Next was the tomato paste-it calls for 3/4 of a 6-ounce can. As I tried to combine the ingredients I saw that they would not blend easily and it was a very thick paste which would just sit in top of the rice. I take full responsibility for the following: I tried to doctor it up with a little oil..then water then it turned into this huge amount and the pb became lumpy and unappealing. A strange red oily substance began to separate from the sauce. I removed most of the \"sauce\" so there was a small amount on the tofu then added 1/2 tsp of chili powder for flavor and...Ketchup! Ketchup is a miracle worker. This recipe was a flavor/texture mess.",

For starters I actually made it with a cup of plain tomato sauce rather than tomato paste (this was after reading other reviews that it was too dry without broth or water added). I also added about 1/4 cup lemon juice to add some extra zest and moisture but the peanut butter in the amount called for was still too overpowering. I would definitely halve or even third the amount of peanut butter next time. Also I found the flavor to be pretty bland...it does need something else. I added rooster sauce when I ate it and extra garlic and garlic salt but still lacking. I didn't really have any other Asian spices besides some chili garlic sauce which I also put in but I think that would help if there were some additional spices. I also added chopped bell peppers and chopped green cabbage that I simmered with the tofu and sauce and that helped a lot. I considered adding canned tomatoes (like other reviews mention) even a can of Rotel to the mix but I was afraid of adding too many elements to the dish--now I'm thinking some Rotel would've helped perk it up a bit. Weird recipe but has potential--I'll maybe try this again.",
