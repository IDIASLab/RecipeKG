I highly recommend at least doubling the salt as it's a bit on the bland side without. I used my own thickener, as suggested in the cook's notes since I don't like the results from using almond flour - it tends to make things gritty.  Instead, I sprinkled about 1/2 tsp of konjac flour over top of the meat mixture in the pan, then stirred it all together. I also highly recommend cooking the vegetables first, then placing into a bowl, then cooking the meat mixture on its own, and combining everything back into the pan. Otherwise, the pan will be overcrowded and the meat will just steam. To save time, you could buy premade frozen mashed cauliflower, thaw it, then spread over top of the zucchini. You could also just steam your own cauliflower florets, then mash it yourself. Just make sure that no matter what cauliflower you use, it is well drained. I'll be making this again, as it makes the perfect leftovers for my work lunches!",
