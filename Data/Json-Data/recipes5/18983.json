Apart from leaving out the celery I made this as written and sadly didn't like it all. The flavors just didn't work well for me. The apple sauce made it really sludgy and I wish I'd omitted the brown sugar because it turned out SO sweet. I even made fresh prawn crackers to go with it (and the oil smell totally stank out my house). Sorry for the low rating.",

Fresh ginger would also be a nice change. Thank you for the unique twist on tomato soup - definitely low calorie!!",

To avoid boiling off too much of the broth while cooking the celery I would saute the celery in a pan first then add it to the soup. That is the only reason I'm giving it three stars.
