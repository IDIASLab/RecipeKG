I would highly reccomend doubling the amount of spinach at least. (This could make it tough unless you have a very large steamer.) Luckily I caught this and just doubled the dressing recipe and saved half of it for later - probably tomorrow. I also would say throwing in some pancetta (or bacon) and some crumbles of blue cheese or something similar. Other than that this flavor blew my mind and I'll be having it over and over!!",
