I love this cake and get many compliments when I bring it to potlucks. My recipe calls for 1/4 cup creme de menthe and 1/4 cup oil. This last time I made it I was out of creme de menthe and substituted 2 tsp. mint extract 2 TB water and 6 drops food coloring (I found this substitute online) but I didn't like it as much. It came out too minty and just not as good overall. So from now on I will always use the creme de menthe to get the wonderful results. My recipe calls for 6 oz dark chocolate - shredded but I now use mini semi sweet chips (about 1 cup) rather than shredding a dark chocolate bar it works great and so much easier. I put half the batter in the pan top with 1/2 cup mini chips and add remaining batter on top of the chips. Bake for 40 min at 350. Let cake cool for about 35 min then turn over onto plate. I melt the remaining chocolate (1/2 cup or more) and drizzle on top of cake. It's SO tasty. Enjoy!",

If you aren't a fan of pistachios though try using a different pudding mix. Other people who ate it liked the cake but they thought the mint/pistachio combo was a bit weird. In the future I'm going to replace the pistachio pudding with vanilla or chocolate. Update: I altered this recipe by using Creme de Banana and banana pudding and it turned out very nicely. It tasted great and would be a good option as well. I also tried it with Creme de Menthe and vanilla pudding but liked the original recipe more!",

After I mixed the batter I realized I didn't have a bundt pan so I used an angel food cake pan and it worked well. I added a few drops of green gel to deepen the green color. I was going to make a vanilla glaze to drizzle over the cake but I forgot! No biggie because this cake doesn't need anything. Some enjoyed this topped w/vanilla ice cream while others enjoyed it plain. I'm ready to go enjoy a slice for breakfast right now;) THANKS for the recipe WILLOWSMOM99!",
