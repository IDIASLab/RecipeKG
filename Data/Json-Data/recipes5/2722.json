I did use sliced Johnsonville Italian sausage instead of the chicken though and I will say that added a lot to the flavor. I would have never thought to add Italian sausage to an alfredo. I'm so glad I did!! Just slice it up and saute until cooked before adding the sauce and seasonings. I also watered mine down a bit to make sure I got all the sauce out of the jar. This was delicious!! Super easy too! If the flavor is lacking for anyone try adding a bit of onion powder salt and pepper to the dish. I don't think it needed it though. Thank you!!",
