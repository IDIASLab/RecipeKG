Because I couldn't get hold of any basil or mozzarella, I instead used oregano (apparently a good basil substitute!) and parmesan. I took one of the reviews into consideration, and added lite cream to the 8 eggs for a fluffier, lighter texture. I made my own pastry and also added diced button mushrooms the second time - it turned out perfectly! The caramelized onions with the added herbs and tomatoes created such a great, heartwarming flavour, and the addition of mushrooms added just a little bit more texture to the filling. I will definitely make this again! 5 stars!",

I also used a combo of cheeses some homemade. Probably the best quiche I have ever made. I also used strained canned tomatoes as I had no fresh tomatoes.",
