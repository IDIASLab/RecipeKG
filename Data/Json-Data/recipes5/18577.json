                "reviewBody": "Being Trinidadian myself I can give a bit more imput into this recipe. We make this hugely popular dish very often and it can be done with variations. I have never heard of using coconut milk in stewed chicken that's usually in curries, You can omit the coconut milk for a very lowfat dish and use chicken broth instead. We usually blend (in blender or food processor)our seasonings such as cilantro, green onions, lots of garlic, a little water or vinegar to moisten and preserve  spanish thyme and of course hot peppers TO TASTE if you can take it. We marinate like some of the comments said longer, overnight is good. We brown just like the recipe said but even even longer than two minutes don't be afraid to really brown as long as you stir it and it does not burn, however I personally use about two tablespoons of sugar or you can also use a few drops of browning such as Benjamin's which comes in a bottle (it is caramelized sugar) or Gravy Master. As you brown adding a little ketchup and soy sauce then add water(or broth), chopped onions, and diced potatoes which thicken, then simmer for 1/2 hour to forty mins and then add a little cornstarch mixed with water toward the end to thicken. It will have a different flavor from original recipe if you omit the coconut milk. As a variation we also stew beef and pork cubes the same way, just cook longer, very delicious. ( a shot of rum in the marinating meat is great and if you like ginger a little bit of it grated is good too).",

The only difference is that I mix the green onion, cilantro, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper....along with fresh thyme in a food processor with about 1T olive oil till it becomes a paste. Then, I rub it into the chicken and marinate it overnight. I also use the rest of the coconut milk mixed w/water to make herbed dumplings (not the kind w/baking powder....I like mine chewy and dense for this dish). Serve w/rice or with doubles (trini delicacy). Mmmmmmm.",

This is now on my kids (teens) most requested list.  I've found that soaking/marinating the meat much longer than 30 minutes is best.  I've never yet used a full bone-in chicken, which I suppose has a lot more flavor than boneless, skinless, thighs and breasts. Therefore, doctoring even further is good.  Also, the sauce tends to be thin because everyone adds the whole can of broth and the whole can of coconut milk.  If you do that, you need to double the initial step with the brown sugar mixture at the beginning.  Make sure to serve with an overabundance of jasmine rice cooked with chicken broth and spiked with cilantro, and green onion and red pepper to taste.  All of the optional steps shouldn't be optional.  They make the dish.  Don't skip.",

To cut colries and fat even more the vegetable oil can even be eliminated just put the sugar to brown in the pot and then throw in the chicken, then add the cocnut milk etc..",
