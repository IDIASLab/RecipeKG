I was looking for different varieties that would fill my 6'8\" husband and satisfy my picky palate. I followed the some of the reviewers advice and added a can of tomatoes to the mix (as well as a dash of minced garlic!)and had preseasoned the meat with Lawry's and garlic salt. I was not paying attention and I didn't add the noodles to the mixture, I put the mixture on top of the noodles, and I rather liked this as it made it less casseroley. I also followed the suggestion and added grated cheddar cheese on top of the mix. My husband devoured the ENTIRE meal,except for my serving (so much for leftovers) and has been asking for it again. :)",
