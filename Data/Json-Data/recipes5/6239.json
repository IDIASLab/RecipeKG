When I found it a bit sweet, I double the recipe without doubling the honey and added about 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard to arrive at this great version. It is a tangy dressing that goes great with spinach and chicken salad. Store in the refrigerator.",

I definitely like the lemon that peeks through in this dressing but I don't know that I'd make this again since regular honey mustard works fine for me. This is good but I really wouldn't say that there's anything that totally differentiates it from another honey mustard dressing that I use from this site.",
