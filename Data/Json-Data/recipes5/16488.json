It takes 3 very large pans,(I used a 5qt. dutch oven, a large saucepan, and a roasting pan), a measuring cup,measuring spoon, a couple of spoons/spatulas to stir, and a very large container with lid to store it in. I had to use a steel wool pad to clean up my saucepan from the caramel sauce. So, be aware, there is quite a bit of clean up. Also, follow the recipe EXACTLY. I was distracted and messed up two batches. pretty badly. One -I let the popcorn sit out too long and it wasn't warm when \"I tried to mix in the caramel sauce. Did not mix up at all. It just clumped up in wads of hard caramel;not coating the corn at all. Totally my fault, but it was not forgiving at all.\r\nOnce I got it right, it was very good but I think I would've preferred a little MORE caramel coating. But, it is pretty cool to make fresh homemade caramel corn, so I will use this recipe again, I am sure. Maybe, for Christmas gifts next Christmas.",

Now that I've had home-made caramel corn I can't stand the store bought stuff! ps: I have an electric oven (ugh!)- it might work differently in a gas one.",

Just a note the amount of popping corn called for was REALLY unrealistic. I Used 2 Cups of Popping corn and that worked out really well. Using 4 cups produced WAY to much Popped corn. (After all how would anyone in a common home (and I have 7 in my family) have a baking dish large enough to accomodate THAT much pop corn.?) The recipe itself was amazingly easy and I found it to be consumed in a matter of minutes. We will be making this on many cold winter Alaskan nights.

                "reviewBody": "One of the problems with the allrecipes culture is that individuals rate recipes with alterations. This recipe is often given 5 stars IF you double the sauce, bake it at a lower temperature, use less corn, use airpopped corn etc. If you follow the recipe, which is poorly written in many respects, the rating is more accurately 1 star.   The one large flaw in the recipe is the direction to \"boil\" the sugar sauce for 5 minutes.  Any butter/sugar sauced boiled for that long will scorch; as mine did. The sauce should be brought to a boil then reduced to a simmer for 5 minutes.    Also, the recipe says to pour the sauce over the popcorn and then bake.  Nowhere does it say to stir THEN bake. This is, of course, obvious to someone who has made carmel corn before, but the lack of precision in the recipe demonstrates, once again, how this recipe, as it stands, is NOT deserving of 5 stars.",
