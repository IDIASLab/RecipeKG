The changes I made were: 1)cubed pork loin chops in place of ground pork that I browned lightly before adding to the slow cooker 2)canned tomato in place of fresh one drained can per tomato called for 3)Slightly less pineapple than called for 4)additional corn kernels in place of baby corn 5)apple juice in place of apple cider 6)additional brown sugar in place of molasses 7)I knew I would be cooking this for 7 hours so I cooked on low instead of high.",
