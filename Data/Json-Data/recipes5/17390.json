Did not place in microwave, but oven at 300 for 8 minutes on parchment (and it wanted to stick). I did not use microwave popcorn.  Instead of milk chocolate, I used 2 cubes of semi-sweet chocolate bark.   I drizzled white chocolate over this popcorn after the photo was taken!  Make sure to store (if it does all get eaten after it comes out of the oven) quickly so the popcorn doesn't dry out.  I will buy a premium popcorn to make this again.",

I don't trust my microwave so I cooked the caramel recipe in a sauce pan on the stove but followed the rest of the recipe as written and it came out perfectly. I didn't get to put any chocolate on the caramel corn because I couldn't get my family to leave it alone long enough to cool but I'm planning to try it with the chocolate next time. This recipe deserves an extra star because it was so easy to clean up afterwards. You throw away the piece of equiptment that gets the dirtiest the paper bag.",

The milk chocalate made this too sweet for me and I am a big fan of milk chocolate. I also had to add more shortening to the chocolate to get it to the right consistency. It may have been the chocolate - I used Ghiradelli's milk chocolate chips. Great caramel corn sensation!",

This time I made the caramel sauce, poured it over the popcorn and then placed the popcorn on a parchment lined cookie sheet. I placed the cookie sheet in the oven for about 8-10 minutes at 350.   Then I drizzled the chocolate. I used semi-sweet.   To help with the drizzle problem, I melted 1 cup chocolate chips with about a tablespoon of butter and then added about 1/2 cup milk. This allowed it to actually drizzle.",
