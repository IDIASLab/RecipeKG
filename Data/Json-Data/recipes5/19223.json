(We don't care for the overly sugared/marshmallowed concoctions that are so popular) The brandy compliments the potatoes beautifully and the raisins add a nice touch. You can bake, peel and slice the potatoes ahead of time and keep in the frig. till needed which is an added bonus. I will try this with dried cranberries for the holidays. This dish will definitely be on my Thanksgiving table. Thanks for sharing!",
