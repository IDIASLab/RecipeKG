They're typically used to make strawberry shortcakes. Also, the can of crushed pineapple did not contain enough juice on our last trip, so I used some of the liquid from the jar that the maraschino cherries came in. Also, some clarification on the cooking, you\u2019ll want to pull embers from the main part of the fire and not cook directly in the campfire(I do about 95% of my camp cooking via the campfire). I have an adjoining ring branched off the main fire where I pull embers and do my cooking..either using a grate (pots/skillet) or cooking in the embers (foil packs, corn/potatoes, dutch oven). You can regulate the temp a little better this way..adding more embers or taking embers away if needed.",

The cakes took no time at all to heat up in the coals, ours were very hot, I think I didn't even leave them on 3 minutes, as soon as you hear steam and bubbling, they're done... and the sugar on the foil caramelizes and it's a real treat when you're out in the middle of nowhere.  Fantastic idea.",

I sprinkled the topping over each individual \"cake\". I wasn't camping when I made this--the kids and I made this in the foil packets but baked them on a cookie sheet in a 350* degree oven for about 20 minutes. This was incredibly easy to assemble and it was a big hit with everyone, even the adults. I served each \"cake\" with a dollop of Cool Whip. Excellent \"pantry\" dessert.",
