It also freezes beautifully and individual portions can be reheated in 3 minutes in the microwave. As a single person, I can't eat 8 portions at one sitting, so I divide and freeze. But it's great if family visits, because I can have the portions ready to reheat, and it's also great if you're in a hurry in the morning and don't have time to cook before heading off to work.",

I've used fresh green and red bell peppers tomatoes and jalapeno peppers when I could only find eggs but was able to get the southwest Egg Beaters on one visit. Each time I made this I've used more egg or Egg Beaters than recipe calls for as much as a dozen large whole eggs or a large carton of Egg Beaters. I've tried with mexican mix cheddar and lowfat (2%) cheeses as well. I've also used more hashbrowns than called because we didn't have hashbrown patties at the store that visit. Two of the times I made this I used the whole bag of Ore Ida Crowns which are like mini tots. Although I find myself having to cook longer due to my variations all attempts have turned out delicious and a real hit.",

I used one roll of crumbled Jimmy Dean Sage sausage instead of Canadian bacon. Also used less cheese (cheddar only) - just enough to create a layer which was probably about 2.5 cups. One Egg Beater package was a bit short of 1 3/4 cups so I added one egg as well. Served with green onion cilantro and sour cream on the side. Delicious! Cooking time was right on target.",

Left out the salt and didn't miss it - the canadian bacon egg beaters and patties had plenty of sodium already! Used only 1 bag of shredded cheese (2 cups) - thought it was plenty. This could use a little bit of spice might try pepperjack next time or a few shakes of crushed red pepper and LOVE the idea of scallions on top! Definitely hearty though!",
