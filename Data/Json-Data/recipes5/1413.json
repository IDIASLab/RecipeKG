I still used the full can of coconut milk. I wondered if the amount of almonds might be a typo--I only used half the amount called for, and it was still very nutty. I don't like a lot of sugar for breakfast, so I only used 2 T sugar. I cooked mine during the day and was able to watch it, and it was done and starting to stick to the bottom at 5 hours.",
