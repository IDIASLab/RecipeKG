Cut way back on the cilantro (personal preference) and did 1/2 Walla Walla onion and 1/2 red onion instead of the green onion because I love the crunch and flavour of raw onion!!  Otherwise, this ROCKS!!!  Will use again on crab cakes and other fish. Thanks for the recipe!!",

I doubled the recipe ingredients since I had two ripe and very sweet mangos on hand and served it over my spicy grilled salmon with couscous and it was a huge hit with my dinner guests.  A tip I learned many years ago is to let the lemon/limes juices sit with the onions first for about 10 minutes, and then add other ingredients.  I didn\u2019t want to use the jalapeno chile pepper, so I used two dashes of red pepper flakes instead and it just enhanced everything without the added heat.  I\u2019ll be saving this recipe in my \u201crecipe box\u201d to use again!  I definitely recommend this recipe!",
