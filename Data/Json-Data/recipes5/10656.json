My hubby is housebound after hip surgery, so instead of the kids having us over, I decided to do a Spanish meal instead of the traditional BBQ. I did the deep fried tacos and this Spanish rice dish! OH BOY,,,, was it good! I  doubled it for the servings that was needed. I had a very large cast Iron skillet that I started it in but of course I ended up transferring it into another pot for it to finish cooking. I only added a couple things different. But, that did not change the taste at all. It would have been fine without them. I added only 1 can of drained black beans, and 1 can of chopped tomatoes. Well, after taste testing I decided that it did need some cayenne pepper which I did not think it needed until I taste tested (thought the jalopenias would to the trick) so I decided to add a pinch and------ more then I wanted went in and wha laaaa,,,, it was the perfect heat to it! My kids all took the leftovers except one bowl left for us. I would recommend this one to try! Thank you Chef John!",

He said he would eat that kind of rice any day. YAY! I was leary of the amount of jalapeno and hot peppers as he is not wild about too much heat but it turned just right for us. I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the chipotle chili powder as I didn't have it on hand. Also I have never been able to make rice properly but this came out perfect by following the directions on timing exactly. I will be making this many times again in the future.

The only problem I had was that I had to add a lot more broth while it was simmering because it was very dry and started to stick to the bottom of the pot. I'm sure it would have burned if I didn't add the extra broth. Very spicy but I like spicy food. The recipe makes a lot so if you don't need a lot of rice I would cut the recipe in half. I'll definitely make this again!",
