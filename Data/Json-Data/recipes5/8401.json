Substitute about 8 Cardamom seeds well ground. Cardamom is highly pungent when you take it out of the processor don t worry it dissipates in the dough and mellows considerably. This adds a slight nutty warm autumn flavor. I also retained the two egg yolks added 4Tbsp Heavy Cream and 1 pat of Room temp. Butter. Mix it well with a small whip or fork until smooth. When the loafs went in the oven I gently brushed the egg-butter-cream mixture over the whole top discarding the rest. Made a really nice flavorful glazed top crust.",
