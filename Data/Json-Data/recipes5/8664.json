As Denice Rayburn said, 33 carbs seemed way too high to me for a recipe with almond flour, butter, erythritol, etc. Where were the carbs coming from??\n\n\nI used my own \"Nutrition/Macros Spreadsheet\" and came up with these results. Note that everything is right in line with this page's stated nutrition facts, EXCEPT the carbs, which are considerably lower:\n\nServing (1/12)\nCalories:   455.02 kCal\nFat:   43.009 g\nCarbs:   5.593 g (NOTE: these are NET carbs, I deduct the dietary fiber in my spreadsheet)\nProtein:   11.787 g\n\n\nSo my calculations show about 6 times LESS carbs than is listed, which makes sense to me because, as I said above, where would the 396 total carbs (33 * 12 servings) be coming from?!\n\n\nErythritol has ZERO net carbs, since it's not digested as a carb by our bodies.",
