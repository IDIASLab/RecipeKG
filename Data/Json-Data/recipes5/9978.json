I used a chuck roast instead of stew meat. I sprinkled kosher salt on the roast and let it rest while I prepared the chilis. I used 5 pasilla, 5 guajillo, and 2 arbol which gave it good flavor while keeping it mild enough for my kids. I also added 4 cloves of garlic along with the onion and then salt to taste. Probably about a tablespoon, plus what was already sprinkled on the meat. It was plenty salty and next time I will use less. For spices, I followed other review recommendations and did a tsp of each cumin, pepper, Mexican oregano. Plus a tiny pinch of cinnamon. Hubby says clove is also common but easy to overdo; I didn\u2019t use any this time.  Served on warm corn tortillas with chopped onion and cilantro and a squeeze of lime. Some sliced radishes along side.  Will make this again! All 6 family members enjoyed, even the picky ones!",
