                "reviewBody": "Billy Sunday Pudding which originated in west central Illinois in the early 1900s according to legend is a family favorite. Although it is a Christmas tradition in our family it is very good any time of the year. I have dozens of versions of this recipe with various ingredients and ingredient amounts but pearl tapioca brown sugar dates and nuts are the consistent ingredients. In fact I have not previously seen this exact submitted version. I will add a couple directions which may answer the other reviewer's complaints. One the pudding can be baked or cooked on top of the stove. If you bake it you need to stir the mixture regularly in order for the pearl tapioca to become clear and the pudding to cook evenly. On top of the stove you must stir the pudding frequently until the tapioca becomes clear. Two all of my recipe versions call for you to serve Billy Sunday Pudding with a topping of Cool Whip or whipped cream. It is a very rich pudding but well worth the effort to make it correctly.",
