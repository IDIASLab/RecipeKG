Plus I used sprouted sunflower seeds which I love. After tasting the dressing I added sea salt pepper and an extra splash of balsamic. I omitted the mayo because I don't use it. I do plan to keep this one--it will be a good lunch salad for work: Mix the dressing ahead of time toss the sunflower seeds on the lettuce and bring the whole avocado to chop up at work. Next time I'll take a previous reviewer's suggestion and use Dijon mustard.",
