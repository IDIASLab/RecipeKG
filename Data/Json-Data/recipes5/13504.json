Then use your right hand to sprinkle some of the coconut over the top and press down into it flip and press down again. This method will help you avoid getting a battered and breaded \"club hand\" the term used by chefs for this problem! Line up the corn starch dip egg dip coconut mix and then a plate ready for the finished fillets. You can do this \"assembly line\" process beforehand then refrigerate till ready to fry. This also makes the coating stick MUCH better! A little resturant tip.",

I made a few adjustments and it turned out perfectly. First, I cut the tilapia loin fillets in half (easier to work with) for 8 nice pieces. I used Baker's Angel Flake sweetened coconut, right out of the package (not finely chopped). It made the texture perfect and crispy (see my photo above). I used 1 whole, beaten, egg in place of the substitute and I put the cornstarch and tilapia pieces into a large ziplock bag and shook them to coat. Tongs were a great suggestion for removing the tilapia from the cornstarch baggie and dipping in the egg and coconut without a mess. To cut down on fat, I baked them in a pyrex dish sprayed with olive oil Pam (also a very light spray on top of the fish to help it crisp up!) @ about 350* for about 20-30 mins. I did not flip them or anything and they were perfectly cooked and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside without being greasy. \nThe Apricot Dipping Sauce is amazing! My mom who ALWAYS and ONLY eats fish with tarter sauce said that \"THIS was way better!\" \nThanks for this recipe, it is easy, elegant and super delish!   A new favorite in my house!",
