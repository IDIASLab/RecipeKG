This sauce was a great barbecue sauce but mine did not turn out with as much guava flavor as I would have liked. My kids LOVED it. We used it on barbecued chicken. I made this recipe exactly the way it tells it to be except I omitted the chile (kids) and added more guava. Next time I make this I will add less tomato paste and see if it's closer to what I was looking for.",

I followed the recipe as written except I used Scotch Bonnet pepper powder instead of an actual pepper. I used 1/2 teaspoon. To make this again I think I would like even more kick so I would add more powder maybe a whole teaspoon. I think that would balance a little nicer with the sweetness.
