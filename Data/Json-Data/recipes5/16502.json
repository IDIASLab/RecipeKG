I usually double the batch, since they are a hit, and as written, the size batch is more suitable for an afternoon snack treat.  I sometimes add nuts, dates, and craisins/raisins.  they stay nice and soft.***Very nice!  Made the house smell wonderful baking too.  Used a gala(quite large one) and shredded w/the skin on for added color and nutrients.  Was interested how they would turn out with the proportion of oatmeal to flour, but they are so soft and moist!  Full of fiber.  Besides the 2 tsp. cinnamon, I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/4 allspice, and 1/4 cardamom.  All the spices complimented the other and none were overpowering.  Did not have nuts so omitted.  Made 26 cookies using the smaller size cookie scoop.  Not sure I will even frost them.  They aren't overly sweet and sickening.  Make sure you shape them up a little before putting in the oven; how they go in is the shape they come out.  Can fit alot on each sheet because they do not spread.  Very nice recipe!  **UPDATE:  I did decide to ice these.  Just stirred together some 10x sugar, milk, and 1/2 tsp. black walnut extract, and 1/4 butter extract.  They are now sooo awesome.  The icing does enhance the flavor of the cookie, and the extracts used are perfect compliments.  This will be my way to go w/the icing flavors for this cookie.  Just delicious!",
