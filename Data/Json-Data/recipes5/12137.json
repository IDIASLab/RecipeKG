I used a bag of mixed beans.  I didn't have ham hocks, but I had the bony part of a spiral cut semi-boneless ham in the freezer.  When I put the beans on to boil, I went ahead and put the ham bones in the crockpot with water on low.  After the beans boiled and cooled, I added them to the crockpot with onions and celery.  Then, I put it in the fridge overnight.  Next morning, it was easy to skim the fat before I turned on the crockpot.  After I got home from work, I pulled out the bones and chopped the meat.  It smelled and tasted out of this world.  Three of us ate over half of it, I can't wait for leftovers.",
