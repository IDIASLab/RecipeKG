Who would have thought these ingredients combined so well?  To make it a quicker recipe though, I browned the chops, removed them from the pan, then sauteed the onions in the drippings.  In a separate bowl, I put in my chopped Granny Smith apples and then sprinkled the corn starch over these and tossed it to coat.  I only had a 14 oz. can of sauerkraut, so I increased brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  I then added the sauerkraut, brown sugar, and sauteed onion with all the drippings to the apples and mixed well.  I placed the pork chops in a casserole dish, covered them with the sauerkraut mixture, covered with foil and baked for 45 minutes at 350.  Perfect!  Served with potato perogies and crusty bread.  One of the few nights where there were no leftovers to put away.  This is a keeper for us.",

I used all ingredients except the vegetable oil and cornstarch and I used a 12 ounce package of refrigerated sauerkraut so I increased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. I sprayed a skillet with Pam and browned the chops. I removed the chops and sauteed the onion in the same pan until tender. In the meantime I mixed the kraut brown sugar and apples added the sauteed onion deglazed the pan and added the drippings to the kraut mixture and seasoned it with salt and pepper. I love my slow cooker so I place the chops in the bottom and poured the rest of the mixture over the top. Cooked it on low for about 6 hours. The chops were tender the sauerkraut nicely sweet and sour and my husband ate every bite which is my barometer of a good recipe. Definitely added this one to my recipe box. Thanks!",
