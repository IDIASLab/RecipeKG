                "reviewBody": "Several commented that this was their first pecan pie, which caused me to realize I've made over 100 pecan pies! Here are a few tips:\n\n- This recipe is the classic variety, which is really the best. Slight changes in the classic recipe include using white vs. brown sugar, using dark vs. light corn syrup, using 2 vs. 4 Tbsp. butter. All are good, personal taste determines your choice.\n\n- Don't over beat the eggs; you don't want them frothy. Melt the butter in a measuring cup and then use the buttered cup to measure the corn syrup so it will all come out of the cup.\n\n- This recipe fills a deep dish pan. If you use a shallow pan then a double recipe will make 3 pies.\n\n- Mix the pecan in with the filling or put them in the pan before the filling. They float to the top. Mixing them in (rather than adding them on top) insures that they have a nice glaze on them.\n\n- Extra pecans may seem like a great idea, but they can't all get to the top. 1-1/2 cups may be too much depending on your pan. If I'm making several pies at once, I cover the bottom of the pans with pecans and then pour the filling on top. I use a fork to flip them over to look pretty after they float up.\n\n- Check to see if pie is done by shaking the pan - no jiggle and it's done. The depth determines how long it will need to bake.\n\nUPDATE: I just made 12 pies in a morning. I put the pecans in each crust, then mixed a double recipe in my food processor and poured the filling on top of each. Easier method for lots of pies.",

I followed the recipe perfectly and only changed to a deep-dish pie crust, which worked out well. It baked for 55 minutes before I pulled it out of the oven because it looked done. (Hard to tell with this type of pie.) Then I served it to friends after it was cooled down to room temperature, and everyone loved it. Very sweet and a rich, creamy consistencey with a crunch - everything a pecan pie should be. Thanks for the simple recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Perfect 'as is,' no changes. My only advice concerns baking & prep. 1) Let eggs come to room temp. If you don't, the pie won't be done by the time specified, resulting in burnt crust & unset filling. 2) Toast the pecans in the oven until browned slightly, between 5-10 min after oven is preheated. It brings out their flavor & helps form a seal so they aren't mushy or hard to cut. 3) Using dark corn syrup, light corn syrup or Lyle's golden syrup (has maple flavoring) all net the same great results. However, in general, baking is a science & ingredients should be subbed carefully; guessing rarely works. 4) Bake on the bottom rack. This helps avoid a burnt crust, plus keep in mind that all ovens are different. I use 325 and cook until the middle no longer jiggles, checking at 40 and 50 min. I have another recipe that demands more pecans (wasteful), and I like a balance of filling & pecans. This recipe is a classic, and it's the only one I use.",
