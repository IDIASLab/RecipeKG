The second time, I remembered to put in the lemon and didn't think it came out as good.  It was a little too tangy and the lemon slightly over powered the rest of the flavors.  I also used less cheddar in both dishes.  I would give it five stars, but have to give the original recipe four since I like it better without lemon.  Regardless, this salad is a definite keeper!",

This is so much better.  I love the addition of lemon.  It makes it so bright and springy.  I was a little concerned about it being too much liquid because the dressing was very runny, however it really firms up in the refrigerator.  The only changes I made were using elbow macaroni, green onions instead of red, omitting the ham and using 1 tsp. of dill instead of 1 tablespoon.  It was delicious and the lemon juice and zest really made the dish for me.  Also, if you're making it to serve immediately and don't have thawed peas, just soak them in hot water for a few minutes and drain.  They thaw right out, but don't get cooked.  Thanks so much for the delicious new recipe.  This will be perfect for summer potlucks and bbqs.",

I had to use plain low fat yogurt because I was out of sour cream. I did as the original poster stated and cubed the cheddar cheese.  Even with the substitutions, the lemon flavor really adds a nice light taste to this salad.  It's a nice change from all those sweet pasta salads.  I think it will taste even better after being refrigerated for a few hours. ",

I also used crumbled bacon instead of ham and green onions instead of red, but ONLY because I didn't want to go the store.  Next time I'll use the ham and red onion.  I'm sure it will be as good or even better.  Thanks! UPDATE: I've made this several times now, and its good as written, and with the above changes.  I always use a little less lemon, though.
