Full of flavor, they take the center stage at any meal, but I am also known to throw them in a fresh garden salad as well. I do tend to always use the largest shrimp I can get my hands on, they seem to have the best flavor to them! Once complete, feel free to serve immediately over pasta, with warm crusty bread and a garden salad, or with a rice dish. This one compliments them all!",

I've tried this with both large and small shrimp and the large shrimp is definitely the way to go.  The smaller shrimp SEVERELY dumbs down the flavor and nobody wants that.  Also, it was a tad too spicy for me (perfect for my husband) so I now use 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes and he can pour on as many as he likes on his plate afterwards :).  For shrimp, we also always buy deveined and preferably with tails off for less work and its perfect if you're short on time.  Also, for us, there wasn't enough sauce to really seep into the pasta, so I kept all as is except used 1 pound of shrimp instead of 2 and poured it over 1 pound of pasta (equivalent to doubling the sauce).  Don't be scared with so many seasonings in this...it works beautifully. Delicious, easy and is ready in such a short time it deserves all 5 stars.  ",

That said I eliminated the cayenne pepper altogether and we found this zippy enough without it. Besides I used a nice smoky paprika (Penzey s) which gave this all the flavor we needed. I expected to dislike it actually thinking the amount of paprika would be more than we d prefer but it was right on. The basil gave this a nice clean fresh finish. I served this over lobster ravioli but a rice pilaf or pasta with garlic and olive oil would have been nice too. Zucchini Provencale also from this site completed our meal.",
