The liquid cooked down really fast so I used a total of 3 tbl wine & 3 tbl lemon juice. Just kept the ratio equal. Just know that you can't add the extra liquid until later or the chicken won't brown it will steam. If it is too thin, add another tbl of butter to thicken or resv one of the tbls the recipe calls for until you add the extra liquid. I used 1 Tbl fresh parsley because I had it on hand. I did use 2 cups of mushrooms per the suggestion. I have been looking for a new simple but tasty chicken recipe and this is it! Thank you Grneyedmustang; this must be the next best thing to being in your kitchen :)",

Also took 130 calories off the total by using only one chicken breast and cutting it into bite-sized pieces.  And, for personal preference, I browned the chicken in the skillet then added the liquid after the browning was complete.  Otherwise, no changes in ingredients - served with angelhair pasta and some good parmesan and a lot of pepper.  Next time, I will add onion.  Very good, grneyedmustang - thanks so much!",

Then cooking the chicken with the vegetables resulted in very dry chicken.\n\nI will try this again with the following changes:\n* saute chicken and remove from pan\n* saute vegetables and remove from pan\n* make sauce and reduce to one half\n* add back chicken and vegetable to rewarm",

That isn't hard to do.\nI have made this as written and a little doctored. The best part is you can tailor this to  your pantry.\n\nI have a Diabetic child and a husband who loves low to no carb and this dish fit the bill. \nWe love it around here. My children both love veggies and this is so easy. \n\nI generally make it with Asparagus, Colored Bell Peppers, Vidalia's, sometimes mushrooms. I leave the wine out and use Chicken Broth. I can't drink white wine. :( But we don't miss it. \n\nThis is such a beautiful presentation and so easy to do. We love crisp veggie's so I saute them only a bit.\nIt's such a vibrant and colorful dish- the flavors are amazing. It's delicate- even more delicate if you use fresh herbs. It's also so good for you.\nI serve it with Jasmine or Brown Rice- you could do garlic pasta. I don't usually double my sauce though- I don't think it's supposed to be saucy though the sauce is great and flavorful. Fresh lemon juice makes it. \n\nI will make this again and again- it's a great dish.\nThanks for sharing.",
