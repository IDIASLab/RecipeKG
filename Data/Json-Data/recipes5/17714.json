It tasted great my husband 9-year-old and 2-year-old loved it. My picky 6-year-old didn't no surprise there. I did change it a little bit. I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and halved the sauce ingredients. I had to use black currant jelly as I couldn't find any red (which may have been why it turned out looking brown and icky?) and I substituted spicy brown mustard for the yellow mustard because I don't like yellow mustard. I put the breasts in an oval casserole dish just big enough for them and poured the sauce over them and cooked according to the directions. I made some brown rice on the side and served the sauce over the rice too yummy! I also made this for my family on Christmas Eve and it was a big hit. It does look a lot better using yellow mustartd and red currant jelly too!",

Tonight I'm hosting a dinner party and I'm serving the pork-chop version. I have a question though. So that I can spend time with my guests and not have to be over the stove the entire time I was wondering if I could prepare the chops (brown them) first prepare the sauce with the almonds pour that over the chops cover and wait until my guests arrive before popping them in the oven. Do you think this will work? Will it dry the pork chops out? I don't want that. I think it will work so I'm going to try it anyway. Hopefully I'll hear from one of you with an opinion. If I don't brown the chops too much I think they'll be juicy and delicious like the first time. They melted in our mouths. Any input is appreciated. Thanks.",
