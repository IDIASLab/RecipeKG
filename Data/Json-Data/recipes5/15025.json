Second, I didn't use bacon bits.  I used  about 1/2 C. real bacon, diced, fried crisp and drained well. (about 6-8 slices) Then along with all the other ingredients, added about 3 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 c sour cream, and a little over 1/4 diced velveeta cheese. Instead of onions, which my husband can't eat, I used about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of chopped chives.  I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain ones on top.  The leftover kept well in the refrig, and reheated like a dream.",

Added a little extra onion for texture a lot less bacon bits (cause I didnt have very many)And for the topping I didnt have bread crumbs so I used crushed baked potato chips with the parmesean and powder and butter. Lays I think they were but YUMMY was that good! Spray the top with olive oil or whatever spray oil you like and it turns out beautifully! Also a yummy way to make the texture and flavor more interesting would be to dice up some green and other colored peppers and mix them in too. I'll try that the next time I make them when I don't have picky munchkin's to feed! Thanks for the ideas Melissa!",
