I let this marinate for 24 hours. The recipe calls for frying in sesame oil but I don't think the author meant toasted sesame oil. If you don't have regular (clear) sesame oil I would recommend putting a dash of toasted sesame oil in the marinade and using peanut of grape seed oil for frying. Sliced thinly against the grain of the meat served with white rice and the peppers. I would use this same marinade for steaks and grill them. Thanks for a great recipe - I am glad I made it.",
