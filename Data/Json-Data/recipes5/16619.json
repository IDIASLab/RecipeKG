Based on the previous review suggesting that they were a bit sweet, I figured that I would be safe in kneading in a bit more flour and rolling the dough out on a floured surface - it was a good call. I then took an almond slice and pressed it into the center of each cookie. They baked up in 8 minutes, spreading slightly. They are chewy with crisp bottoms, a good spiced cookie! Thank you Iris!",

I usually leave out the nuts also though because they are always too expensive for me to keep on hand. I wonder how they would be with candied fruits and less sugar?",
