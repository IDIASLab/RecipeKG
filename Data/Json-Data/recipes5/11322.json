Thsis is my first review as I normally dont do them!!I made it exactly as described minus the fresh parsley because I did not have it at home. You can do SO MUCH with this recipe.....You could add any ingredient you want to change it up to your liking. Examples: Add celery humus olives tomatoes mushroom beans & much more. You could eat it with salad wraps toast sandwich lettuce wraps or straight up as I did! You could add or delete ingredients as you like. Examples: add orange zest grapefruit zest or leave it out. You could add honey avocado hot sauce left over shredded chicken or any meats. You can add or delete anything you want to this recipe! Thank you to who ever posted it!",
