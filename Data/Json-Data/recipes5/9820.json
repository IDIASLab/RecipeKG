I used several different colors of tomatoes from my garden and it was completely delicious.  The leftovers are best reheated in the oven.  This make a great dinner dish (either a side or a compilation of veggies for a summer, vegetarian dinner) or it would be a great brunch dish.  Or just eat it whenever.  I don't think anyone would judge you for that.",

I used my standard pie crust recipe and use my pie weights for the initial bake. I have an abundance of tomatoes and basil growing in the garden and this is the perfect recipe for using them up. I used a few cherry tomatoes on the top just to jazz it up. It is delicious. The family loved it.",
