I used spicey sausage and made my stir fry vegetables from my garden that I froze this summer. I don't eat seafood and I am making an effort to learn how to cook it for my seafood loving husband. So after the vegetables and sausage finished cooking I removed some for my self and continued on with the recipe. The first thing Bill said as I set the bowl in front of him was you are learning girl! He took his first bite and then didn't say another word until his dish was empty. He declared it wonderful filling and full of flavor. This dish makes even the most amateur of cooks look good. A good dish to serve when you want to impress the boss or in laws.",
