I used reduced fat cream cheese reduced fat sour cream in place of the mayo (I'm low on mayonnaise until we go shopping again) and my own homemade taco seasoning. My husband and I really liked this--the kids were kind of lukewarm about it. For them it was a little too hot. My husband ate most of this himself. I think next time I'll throw the ingredients for this (minus the parsley) in the oven or my little crockpot and try it as a warm dip. I think it would be great that way too. This was a great way to make a quick \"dip\" for the boys on the weekend and use up the last bit of cream cheese I bought cheap around Christmas and a half-full jar of pickled jalapeno rings. Thanks for another winner mis7up!",
