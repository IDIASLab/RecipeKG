The addition of atypical chili spices may make you skeptical but the finished product is worth the risk! I added two medium vine-ripened tomatoes chopped when the canned tomatoes were added to increase the flavor. Next time I will halve the water as ours was too watery and we had to simmer it uncovered for about 10 minutes extra. However that 10 minutes made the beans just tender enough and I would add them half-way through the simmering time to make sure they are tender enough for the next time. Another suggestion would be to halve or leave out the brown sugar it was a bit too sweet for my taste but will definitely make it again!",
