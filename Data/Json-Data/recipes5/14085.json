But when I made the entire dish that evening, WOW!  I made a special trip to a Oriental market for fresh lemongrass and that made a huge impact on the sauce.  We had the fish served over rice and a side dish of green beans.  Very rich, very Thai.  I highly recommend you double the sauce in this recipe.   I'm going to try it over chicken as well.",

Mozart took the silly little tune and turned it into something great. The same holds true with this recipe. I added one whole can of coconut milk 3 x 1 inch piece of ginger peeled 12 almonds 2 tablespoons of brown sugar 1 tablespoon of fish sauce 2 tablespoons of curry paste(red or green or yellow) dropped the salt and sprinkled the fish on one side with hot curry powder and black pepper and garlic powder on the other side. I added 1 tablespoon of sesame oil to the pan and lightly fried both sides of the fish and then covered with the sauce on low heat for 15 minutes garnished lightly with red pepper powder then served over a bed of rice.That was really an AWESOME dish!!!",
