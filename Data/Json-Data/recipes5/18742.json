I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic and 2 medium sized shallots in some butter to start. Then I added the kraut (I used uncooked \"Bubbies\" brand) brown sugar diced apples (I only used 1 large apple to 1lb Kielbasa -- I'm not nuts over apples) a half cup of raisins and half bottle of amber beer. Let it simmer for about 10 mins with the lid off so the liquid would reduce. I sliced and browned the Kielbasa separately and then tossed it in with the kraut along with a teaspoon of caraway seeds and a half teaspoon of nutmeg. Let it cook for about 5-7 mins more and serve with some honey mustard on the side. Deee-lish.",

I feel like it needed some kind of bite maybe a diced onion or pepper? I think I'm going to play with the recipe and try again.",
