My grandfather had several acres of asparagus on his farm, and this was something they served during the spring and fall whenever asparagus was plentiful. This recipe is also good served with warm breakfast ham or Canadian bacon--just put in on the toast before the egg. Top this masterpiece with another slice of toast to make a sandwich and eat it on the go.",
