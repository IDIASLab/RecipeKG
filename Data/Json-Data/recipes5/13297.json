Panko has better flavor and texture than regular bread crumbs.  I did \"doctor up\" the Panko with garlic salt, Adobe (secret ingredient) and pepper.  Then added a little italian seasoning for color.  I did use a little more Panko than the 1 cup.  It needed a little firmer texture.  The author is right, eyeball it!  Lastly I added some finely chopped onion.  \r\nThis won some rave reviews on a cold Oct day in NE while watching the NE Patriots.  Not typical \"Football\" food, but everyone had seconds :)\r\nI also made some Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Roasted Garlic.  \r\nYum!",

I did add another 1/4 ketchup. Overall a nice meatloaf basic and simple and nothing for picky eaters to complain about either! Great for kids maybe a bit bland for grown up tastes. Thanks.",
