You could probably omit the broth (which I think is used more to thin the miso than for flavoring) because once the dressing sits on the zucchini it thins quite a bit. This is great with just the sauce and the zucchini but the almonds and nori complete it perfectly.",

I use Dashi flavored miso and omit the sessame (I love the seeds but I never have them at home) and often time I forget to put in the nori.

My only concern when making this was which size nori sheet was called for. I live in Japan where there are many options so I just ended up using one onigiri (riceball) sized sheet of nori. Worked great. I think they also sell thin slices of it at the store and may try that to cut down on prep time. Made to a T except I have already toasted seeds on hand and accidently added it to the dressing instead of sprinkling on top (won't make that mistake next time). I tossed the zucchini into the dressing then scooped them out of the dressing and into the bowls. Next time I'll omit the chicken stock it's not needed. We loved the flavors everything just complimented each other so well. Easy tasty and looks great. I'll be making this for quests at some point.",
