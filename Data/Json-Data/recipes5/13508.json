Savory turkey is mixed with a touch of stuffing and a layer of vegetables, all topped with a fluffy and sweet potato mixture. Don't have time to make from scratch? Then simply substitute your turkey dinner leftovers! Chopped, cooked turkey and your homemade gravy can be substituted for the ground turkey mixture. Leftover vegetables greatly reduce prep time.",

But I wanted a more flavorful festive recipe. After searching through a couple dozen I chose this one. It's healthy delicious and had all the wonderful aromas and flavors of a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. I had some left over mushrooms and I mixed it with the meat. This will be my Christmas Eve Shepherd's pie for years to come! Thank you very much.",

I made this almost like the recipe states..except that I didn't use the white potato.  I used about 4 LARGE sweet potatoes that I boiled until soft..mashed with some butter and a little bit of sour cream.  This made  a LOT of mashed sweets, but I had a little cooks treat while the casserole was baking.  I sauted the onions, garlic, and carrot in some oil..then removed and browned the ground turkey..added the cooked vege's back in and added some corn and peas.  I also added about 2 cups of chicken broth and then let this cook for a little bit.  I then added a slurry of cornstarch to the turkey mixture and let that thicken.  I added poultry seasoning, salt and pepper, some parsley.  This turned out really well and I'm sure that I'll make this again.  Its relatively healthy and tasty and sure to please.  I bet kids would like it too :)",
