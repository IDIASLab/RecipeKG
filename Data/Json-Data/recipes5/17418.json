I used store-brand skimmed milk powder. Nescafe espresso powder and light brown sugar. It foamed up beautifully and there was no 'grime' at the bottom of the cup. I agree with a previous poster that it needed a touch more sugar. I added a single serving pouch of sugar (1 tsp) to my cup and that was perfect. I will add some extra sugar to the mix when I give it as gifts.",

Tied small whisks onto jars with ribbons and gave as Christmas gifts.  Everyone loved it! (whisking works, as well).\r\n\r\n",

As others found I too thought it was not sweet enough... easy to fix add more sugar though that didn't seem to fix it. So I did as others had suggested and put the mix into the blender/food processor. The taste didn t get any better and it still did not dissolve completely when mixed. There was a greasy layer on the top and it had a bitter aftertaste I think it was the semi-sweet chocolate chips. Anyway I m sorry but this just didn t taste good to me.:(",
