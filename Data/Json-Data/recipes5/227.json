This is along the lines of restaurant chicken korma as I remember it from before my days as a vegan. There are a lot of ingredients that most people don't normally have on hand, but this is worth it. Garnish the curry with cilantro leaves, cashew meal, and coconut flakes. Serve over basmati rice. Enjoy!",
