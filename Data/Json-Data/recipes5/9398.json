Maybe increasing tahini or seasoning veggies in some way so something pops out? I liked that it included all ingredients I had on hand would be easy to modify and was relatively quick to put together. I will definitely try this again with some tweaks.",

The cashews offer a great crunch and the sauce isn't too overpowering. Plus it's great cold. Definitely a keeper!",
