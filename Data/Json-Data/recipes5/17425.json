Everytime I make it they all say \"Mom you make the BEST sauce!!\" When we go out to eat they say \"Mom you should give this restaurant your sauce recipe!!\" THANK YOU BRYAN this is the Absolute BEST SAUCE!!! It's DELICIOUS!!! I have used chunky tomatoes as well as puree and crushed. Sometimes I add celery salt and sometimes I don't. You don't necessarily need that ingredient so if you don't have any don't go buy it just for this it's PERFECT without it!! And as far as chile pepper I just use regular crushed red pepper and it works just fine. You will LOVE it!!",

I looked at the can of crushed tomatoes I had in the cupboard for months with the intent of making my own sauce and was finally forced to take the challenge...so glad I did. This was the absolute best sauce I've ever tasted!! I won't go back to jarred. I only required 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Suggestion: only use 1 TBS oilve oil - 2 made a film of oil around the end that just wouldn't encorporate into the sauce. Quick and Delicious!! Thanks Bryan!!!",

I made a few minor variations - used chipotle chili pepper for a smoky spice and threw in a small palmful of both basil and oregano (dried) for a tad more Italian flavor. I added the 1/2 cup of brown sugar it says to do initially but I only added about another 1/4 cup because it was perfect. This is delish and different not to mention easy. I'll make it again!",
