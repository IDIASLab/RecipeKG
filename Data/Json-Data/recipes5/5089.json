The entire time I was making this I really wanted to add a shot of sesame some garlic and some soy to the veggies. I wish I would have. The chicken had good flavor but there was no \"sauce\" to speak of to add any flavor to the veggies. This was ok but it won't be a repeat at the LTH house. Thanks for the recipe ally-gator!",

Instead of using butter to saute the veggies I used sesame oil in the wok where I cooked the chicken (putting the chicken aside) and added the tablespoon of soy sauce to the veggies while cooking. I also added about a teaspoon of cayenne to the mixture that cooks with the chicken. Overall it turned out really yummy!",
