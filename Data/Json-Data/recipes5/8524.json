I realized too late that I accidentally tripled the pumpkin spice but it didn't seem to be a problem. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I even added the optional topping of whipped cream cinnamon and nutmeg. I couldn't really taste the pumpkin puree after I added it being such a small amount. The taste is good just it's kind of sweet for my tastes. However I can see anyone that likes these flavors to enjoy this.",
