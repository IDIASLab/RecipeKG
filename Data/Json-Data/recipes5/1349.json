I let the meat rest out of the fridge for about an hour before starting the recipe, those who needed to cook the rack longer than the recipe states either have their oven too low (get it calibrated) or started with the meat too cold. Anyway, after 12 minutes in the oven it was perfectly medium rare in the middle and medium/medium well on the end cuts. It was incredibly easy as well, what more could you ask from a recipe that would impress the Queen?",

I added italian seasoned breadcrumbs (left out the salt) and put chopped rosemary & thyme at the end. Stirred it up a bit, and set it aside. Turned out SO GOOD!",

My husband has eaten a lot of lamb and he raved that this was the best he's ever had!  For a 1.40 lb, 7-rib rack, searing + 17 minutes in the oven produced a medium-RARE roast (some deeper glossy red in the center).  I strongly recommend a digital instant-read thermometer when making this recipe  Also, if not working with an oven-proof skillet, have your roaster pre-heated in the oven for immediate transfer.",

The recipe was delicious, but if, like me, this is the first time cooking lamb, I wanted to mention some things that I had to research after this recipe went wrong, and should be noted.  Firstly, I asked my butcher for a rack of lamb to be \"frenched\" - after researching what this meant.  That was great, but after cooking, and trying to serve, I now realize I should have asked for them to REMOVE THE CHINE BONE.  It's not mentioned here, but if you don't ask the butcher to do this, you end up with a mess, like me, since even my Wustof chef's knife couldn't cut through that bone that connects each chop.  Finally, the time was off.  I was planning to serve roast potatoes and asparagus with the lamb.  It ended up taking 20 minutes longer than this recipe said...maybe my over was off a bit, but over doubling the cooking time for medium rare?  don't think so...  Anyway, after 30 minutes, I had lovely medium rare lamb, and the crust was delicious...but with burned/overcooked asparagus and potatoes.  I will try this recipe again as less of a novice next time, and re-comment.",

Lamb is expensive and it's always tough to gauge how long and for what temp when all is listed is a \"a rack of 7-8 ribs\".  For example an 8 rib rack can range in weight from .75 pound to 2.5 lbs and cooking 2.5 lbs for 12 minutes is nuts!   Also, New Zealand lamb is much smaller than Colorado lamb.  Colorado lamb can be cooked longer since it's larger and it doesn't taste as gamey. So, here is a better method. 1) Use a 400 degree oven when your lamb is over 1 pound. 2) Don't sear the lamb.  S & P it and oil it and put it in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes and then remove it and add the mustard and bread crumb mixture. 3) Put it back in the oven for 30 min (45 minutes for a 2 pound) and you will have a lovely medium rare rack of lamb with a nice crust.  Let it rest etc...",
