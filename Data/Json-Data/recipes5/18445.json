Some have said that it takes at least four hours to get the chutney to a thick consistency.  When I first made this recipe, I also felt that it was a little thin, but I went ahead and processed it anyways.  When the chutney had cooled off after processing it was quite a bit thicker.  I still only cook the chutney for 1 1/2 hours.  I also wanted to note that the recipe says that it takes 8 hours for prep.  That is an error that all recipes made when printing the recipe.  It doesn't really take much more than 30 minutes to do the prep work.  ",

I added 1/4 c fresh finely chopped jalapenos to add a little spice. The chili powder did not add enough heat for my taste. I also added 1/2 bulb of garlic instead of just a few cloves. I found it difficult to find preserved ginger so I used crystalized ginger in the same portions. Easy to make and has been such a delight for my entire family - including extended family - that I made a 2nd batch. I doubled the recipe to use as gifts later this year. Thank you for the nice recipe.",

Mix all ingredients in a large bowel, cover with a dish cloth and let sit overnight - the flavor becomes deeper 2. Cook time for thickness will vary based on the ripeness of the peaches. I usually cook 2 hours... and as suggested when my patience is not there or time does not allow, a little pectin goes a long way. 3. Roasted garlic if you have time adds a slightly more robust taste.  This is a standard in my house with grilled meats and salmon.",

I thought I would share my notes on how I made it this year using Pomona's Pectin to speed the cooking process and so I can make it again next year. Thanks Shana for posting such a great recipe. Spicy Peach Chutney 4 pounds sliced peeled peaches 1 cup raisins (I used golden) 2 cloves garlic minced (I used a little less and added about Tablespoon of salt while mincing) 1/2 cup chopped onion 5 ounces chopped preserved ginger ( I am going to try grated peeled fresh next time) 1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder (cayenne) 1 tablespoon mustard seed 1 teaspoon curry powder 4 cups packed brown sugar (possibly dark brown due to use of 1/3 white sugar) 4 cups apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup pickling spice (Tampico smells better than Mojave brand to me) MODIFICATIONS TO ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS TO USE POMONAS PECTIN: (The advantage to this is reduced cooking time and better control over jelling) Boil 2/3 of brown sugar vinegar spice packet and can add onions and garlic now or after 10 15 minutes depending on texture desired. Boil until reduced by 1/3 to over high heat should reduce into a syrup. About 1 minute prior to adding peaches add rest of spices. I used cayenne pepper for heat instead of chili powder and mix. Add peaches and calcium water as per recipe for peach jam for volume you are making using hot method on Pomona s pectin box recipe insert.Take 1/3 sugar(white) and mix pectin very well with hand into sugar",

                "reviewBody": "If it looks like soup or a sauce don't panic! CHEAT!;) You can still save your time and money you invested. Just add some gelatin and/or pectin. You can find it in any large grocery store in the baking isle and it only costs a couple of dollars. One box should do it. It will vary depending on how long you have cooked down the chutney. I wished I didn't leave mine on the stove simmering while I went to the store. I would have liked it more fresh than dark brown Also I would slice the peaches a good centimeter in thickness and cut the segment in half. Because when you cook down the chutney you want some peach substance left over. Once you have added the pectin you won't notice the set until you have cooled the chutney down. Anyways it may not be te conventional way and I'm not too sure it changed how the original recipe's was suppose to taste but it shouldn't have and worked and tasted great! I just gave it a stir after I cooled it down in the fridge and I got nice thick chutney suitable for Indian Royalty. If you're looking for something a bit different then this is the one. There is no doubt that when you serve this to your guests that it's homemade cause you can't buy something like this in the store. But make sure you have fun with the recipe and play with it..make it your own if you love onions add more onions. That's the fun of cooking and if you're like me it's never the same the next time around.",
