First the final product was substantially thicker than it should have been and ladled over the rice the result was something closer to risotto in consistency than curry over rice. Second the flavor was familiar to the curry I was used to in Japan but it was blander. The best part of this recipe is how easy it was to fix at the table. All it it took was a tablespoon of salt and a can of chicken broth the next day and the flavor and consistency were fixed. It was at least as good if not better than SB box curry. I am definitely making this again!",
