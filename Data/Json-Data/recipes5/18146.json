Next time I'll dice the hotdogs and mix the noodles hot dogs and sauce. I also added more onion (chopped 1 onion) than called for. I might add a can of chopped tomatoes next time and perhaps a bit of hot sauce. Also the sauce was just \"ok\" in my book. The main draw for this dish is that it's quick and easy.",
