I only made half and that was more than enough. Otherwise, the quinoa would be swimming in liquid. Also, roasting at 475 for 15-20 minutes would be way too hot, at least in my oven, so I did 400F and the veggies came out perfectly done and nicely roasted. I also used 1/3 cup feta instead of 1/2 cup, as I didn't want it to overpower the other flavors. I couldn't find beets in an 8oz can, so I just used half of a larger can. This one's a keeper and I'll make it again! Next time I might use a little less sugar in the dressing.",
