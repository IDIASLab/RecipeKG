I ended up adding almost another whole cup of oatmeal and another 1/2 cup of flour. As is this is a nice basic oatmeal cookie. The Kahlua adds a nice flavor. I think that the walnuts and white chocolate chips should be a must for this cookie instead of being optional. That would have really taken your average oatmeal-raisin cookie and made it extraordinary. NOTE: If you are baking this at 350 11 minutes is about right for a soft cookie. This makes more of a cake-y cookie not necessarily chewy. Half a batch made 31 medium sized cookies.",

I substituted light margarine for the shortening but would have also liked to have tried applesauce instead. I used non-stick non-fat cookin spray instead of greasing the pans (which worked like a charm). I switched half the brown sugar for an equal amount of Splenda cooking sweetener. Also since I was halving the recipe and 3 eggs doesn't \"halve\" neatly I just used a whole carton of egg substitute (which is the equivalent of 2 eggs). With all those changes the cookies came out very flavorful and cake-like. I do prefer chewey cookies but that's the price you pay for excluding the shortening. I included the walnuts but not the white chocolate. Making these changes yields a very tasty light cookie. I did cook half on an air bake pan and half on a regular pan and the air bake ones turned out a little less than my liking but otherwise still tasty.",
