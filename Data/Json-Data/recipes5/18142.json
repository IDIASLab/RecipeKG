We grilled it over charcoal and the orange juice and brown sugar gave it just a slight hint of sweetness - not too much. The smell on the grill was great and it tasted even better. I can't wait to try this for kabobs. It really does make a tough cheaper cut of meat very tender. I would take the submitter's advice and marinate it for at least 6 hours or more.",

I prefer something much heartier - red wine onion worchester etc. I made these with my own bacon wrapped potato wedges and grilled corn on the cob so the flavoring really seemed out of place.
