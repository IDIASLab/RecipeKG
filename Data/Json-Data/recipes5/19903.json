I was actually quite surprized by the end result of cooking it in the crockpot. I thought that the onions and apples would be inedible because they cooked for so long but once I drained off all of the liquid the apples and onions made a kind of relish that went perfectly with the brats. Flavor was very good. Family ate every bite. I will most definitely make this again.",

If you decide to bake these, I highly recommend you do so uncovered because the brats didn't brown up/caramelize and I had tons of liquid when it was done.  My results came out 3* but I'll give it 4 because they would be much better dark and candied as the recipe states, and it's my fault they weren't.  Will try again!",
