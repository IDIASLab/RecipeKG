The only changes I made were using home canned tomatoes (canned without salt) so I had to add a little extra salt and I didn't have any \"Italian seasoning\" blend so I used Basil Oregano and Thyme. I was a little worried it would be excessive on the seasonings but it's just right. Oh and I cut back on the meatballs a bit. I added 18 instead of 25. It's not lacking. I'm tempted to add white and kidney beans and some corn and maybe some sun dried tomatoes next time.",

I think adding kidney beans and corn as another reviewer suggested would be good. As written it just wasn't flavorful enough for us but I was able to adjust it to fit our tastes.",

I didn't put peppers in (kids don't like didn't have anyway) deglazed the onions and garlic with a bit of red wine before adding everything else and used chicken/turkey broth. Everyone liked with crusty bread and butter will make again! I was fooled by the \"4 servings\" and used way too small of a pot. Use at 6 litre dutch oven! Also this is way more than 4 servings! So good thing we liked it ha ha. Edit: This freezes well without the pepper I made a batch and froze in lunch-sized servings.:)",
