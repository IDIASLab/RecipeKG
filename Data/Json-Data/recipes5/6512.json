The marinade was spectacular with a wonderful garlic and lemon flavor. The spices were delicate and not overpowering. This recipe would be great for a tapas night or as a topping on pasta rice etc... Using Reynolds non stick on the grill made cooking the shrimp an easy task with no mess and cleaning was a breeze. This recipe is a keeper!!!",
