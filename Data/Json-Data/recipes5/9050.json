So, I made a single serving one day and am sharing my recipe so you don't have to waste extra servings either! If you like your chicken salad crunchy, add some cashews! Serve as a sandwich or on top of lettuce!",

It's not a blend, just this awkward mushy thing in my chicken salad.  Get it out!  Apples are good, some nuts, alternatively, a little grape maybe, then some things on the savory side, celery, try small bites of artichoke and such - boiled egg?  Not here.",

If inclined you might want to add a variety of chopped accents like celery, green onions or bell pepper + one teaspoon of lemon juice.  One more tip - If not looking to reduce calories do your taste buds and health a favor by using an avocado oil based mayo.",
