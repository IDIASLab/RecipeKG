The amount of butter, brown sugar, chocolate and nuts are enough for ONE pan - not two.   I used 6 crackers on one pan and had another pan ready just in case.  The thick caramel was just the right amount for the one pan - it would not have stretch ed to cover both.  Ditto on the chocolate and nuts.  So if you want to make two pans, you need 12 crackers, 2 cups of butter, 2 cups of brown sugar, 4 cups chocolate chips and 2 cups chopped nuts!  Hope this helps!",
