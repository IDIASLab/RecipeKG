Typically I would categorize egg salad as a main dish but adding the avocado made it more of a dip. I served it to my husband (a creature of habit) on toast and he only like it so-so. However my daughter and I ate it on crackers (Wheat thins to be specific and later saltines) and we loved it. I usually use a whole lot more mayonnaise in egg salad but the avocado reduced the need. It's a hit that I'm bringing to my next family barbeque as a dip. For me the added benefit is that it's vegetarian so works very well for my vegetarian family members.",
