It is like the ricotta I used to buy directly from the local farmer in Sicily. It has a slight hint of lemon and soft yet grainy texture. This recipe works wonderfully with goat's milk or even sheep's milk. I was taught to only use a wooden spoon with ricotta or even better, a twig from a lemon tree. Thank you for the recipe.",
