I brought the ingredients (substituting the more traditional french bread slices) to the annual holiday hoo haa to assemble there. Upon arrival I spotted at least five other platters of bruschetta of various types and I almost didn't make these out of concern about waste as the other platters were just being picked at. I persevered and without fanfare plopped these on the groaning board. Within 5 minutes all 36 had disappeared.",

The butter mixture was so yummy- next time I'm going to double that part. I baked @ 350 for 10-15 minutes instead of broiling (only because I don't have very good luck broiling). I also omitted the olives (don't care for olives). Will definitely make again! Thank you!",
