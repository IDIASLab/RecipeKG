These are the changes in procedure that I made: Poked the spaghetti squash with a sharp knife a few time and microwaved on high for 12 minutes. Set aside to cool enough to handle while preparing remainder of dish. Used no oil to cook Italian sausage, and added the green pepper when I cooked the onion. I had no fresh tomato, but always keep diced tomatoes in stock. I drained a can and added to the cooked ingredients to heat through. Then when those were ready, I cut the spaghetti squash in half, shredded and continued with remainder of recipe.\n\nThis is a keeper and I will be making it again.",
