I don't own an Instant Pot so like one reviewer I baked it in a 400 degree oven for 45 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly as written but like other reviewers have stated it does need some salt and pepper added to the meat mixture. If I could I would give it four and a half stars but I can't so I'm giving it four stars due to the lack of salt and pepper in the ingredients list. I will make these again. Yum!!!",
