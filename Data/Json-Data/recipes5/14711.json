As the poster and another reviewer mentioned, proper mixing of all ingredients before pressure cooking is important, to ensure the top layer of noodles gets enough moisture.  I thought I had mixed mine enough, but the top noodles were still a little dry or al dente.  Finally, I appreciated the time for the Instant Pot to heat up and release pressure being included in the instructions; it drives me crazy when recipes don't include that information.",
