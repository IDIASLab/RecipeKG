I baked mine for about 8 minutes, or until the edges were lightly browned and the centers were still soft.  Because the recipe calls for a sugar substitute, the cookies will not have the same texture as the real sugar version; but for keto cookies, they are quite good.  Happy low carb eating!",

I make my own, and it's moist and creamy - as a result, so are the cookies. I added 1/4 Cup Coconut Flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 1/4 Cup of White Chocolate Chips (keto, of course) and the cookies came out amazing. It really improved the texture. I may also add a touch of Almond Flour on the next round. If your peanut butter is dry and hard to stir, I am sure your cookies will suffer as a result. Take the time (10 minutes) and make your own. 2 cups of peanuts, 2 tablespoons of peanut oil, 2 Tablespoons of sweetener, dash of salt, and you're off to the races. Just be sure to blend the peanuts by themselves for about a minute.. add half the oil, blend another minute, then the remaining oil, salt and sweetener. Blend until you have your desired consistency. Well worth the time and effort.",
