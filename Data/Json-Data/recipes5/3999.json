First the recipe only calls for cooked chicken it does not say how to cook it so I saut\u00e9ed 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts in olive oil (I never measure anything) then I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and a half can of cream of onion (Next time I will try cream of celery) 1 can of the chicken broth then I added the mayo approx. 3/4 cup a dollop the celery onion water chestnuts (cut into small pieces) then the juice from one lemon fresh squeezed into sauce mix salt and garlic powder. I boiled wide egg noodles (instead of rice) and mixed everything. (including the noodles) then I put everything in a casserole dish and cooked for 20 minutes then I topped it with the ritz cracker and butter mix I used almonds and Colby however next time I am thinking I will omit the Almonds and use a mixed shredded cheese for top. This was the BEST casserole I have ever made. My family wanted more more more. I changed it up according to everyone s reviews (especially the \"only tastes like mayo\" review) Thank you for the base recipe I would not have been able to do it without that. This is def a 10 star casserole after the changes!! Thank you",
