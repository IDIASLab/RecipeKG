I served it with homemade coleslaw, in which I substituted half of the vinegar in the sauce for tobasco, to give the sandwiches some zing.  Next time, the only thing I will change, I will use tomato sauce instead of ketchup, for the same results with a lower price tag.",

However, I usually don't understand why people change a recipe before they even try it and then review the changes not the original recipe.  I am afraid I am guilty though of doing that this time myself.  The recipe called for 5 T of minced garlic.  Well my jar of minced garlic said that would be equal to 10-15 cloves of garlic so I said no way! I put in only 2 T and it was just right, but I am not a huge garlic fan.  I also bought 3 lbs of boneless chicken breasts and boiled them for almost 3 hours...very tender!  I also put in only 1/2 cup dejon mustard and may only put in 1/3 next time.  And there will be a next time because these sandwiches were FANTASTIC.  I would not recommend using bottled BBQ sauce though because this recipe has a very unique tasts.  Also the slaw is absolutely mandatory so don't leave that off.",

When it was done the chicken fell right off the bone making it easy to shred for the sandwich! Then we doubled the sauce and it made for awesome chicken bbq sandwiches esp with the coleslaw on top!
