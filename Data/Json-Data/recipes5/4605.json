I used storebought pesto because I was too eager to try this recipe (read: too lazy) to make my own. the pesto-in-a-jar had citric acid, so it didn't need an entire tsp of lemon juice. I can't say for sure, but I imagine that if you used homemade pesto this wouldn't be a problem. I used a muenster/provolone combination & sliced black olives because that's what I had in my cupboard. I also didn't add anywhere near 2 tbsps of mayonnaise; just enough to bind it all together will do. my final suggestion would be to place the tortilla flat in a skillet to warm & lay the cheese on top to melt it. microwaves do terrible things to bread products, imo. I enjoy finding new, delicious, inexpensive ways to prepare tuna, so thank you for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "A nice variation of tuna salad! The amount of sauce is perfect for 2 cans of tuna (instead of 1) but that just dilutes the zing of the recipe. Next time I'd try the sauce with only 1 T of mayo (keeping the rest of the sauce ingredients as written ) and it would be about the right amount of moisture for 1 can of tuna. The 6 oz cans of tuna have been replaced by 5 oz cans so keep that in mind too. I didn't microwave the tortilla. We like to toast our wraps in a medium-hot nonstick skillet so I layer the ingredients with the cheese first (so it melts) then the tuna lettuce & kalamata olives. Put the seam side down first and as they toast just roll them a little at a time until the outside is toasted. Makes a great light lunch. Served with fresh garden tomatoes topped with a light dressing and feta on the side.",
