Now I don't know if that extra half cup made these brownies better or worse, but oh my gosh these were good! After having one in order to rate this recipe, I'm ashamed to even reveal how many I had after that! These were butterscotchy and chocolatey, perfectly moist, with a funny little bumpy, crackly top--so pretty! Quick and easy to throw together, with amazing results. Individual oven temps and baking pan types can, of course, affect the baking time, but mine were perfect at 24 minutes.",

These are very rich moist and flavorful with the butterscotch & marshmallow making them distinctive. (I can't fathom anyone thinking they are \"hard and tasteless\"!?) I have found that I need to cook them for 28 minutes or else they are slightly undercooked. (My original 18 yr. old recipe card says 20-25 minutes.)",

They do tend to stick to the pan, so I'd suggest making sure your pan is greased really, really well. But they're definitely worth making!",

I also baked them for the full 20 minutes and at first they still seemed like they weren't quite done yet but i'm glad I didn't bake them any longer because after cooling they turned out just right. Thank you for sharing this recipe and the recipe name fits because they're going to disappear fast.:)",
