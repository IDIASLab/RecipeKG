What a great idea! I did taste it after cooking and felt it needed more seasonings for our tastes so I used 2 tsps chili powder 1/2 tsp cumin 1 tsp oregano and some garlic and onion powder. I think you could easily customize this with any seasonings according to what you like. I also cooked mine a bit longer than 25 minutes to thicken it just a bit more. I served it topped with a bit of salsa and pepper jack cheese--delicious! Thanks for the recipe!",
