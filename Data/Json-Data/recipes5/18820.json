I made them exactly as the recipe called (except I used regular butter instead of unsalted I like the extra bit of saltiness if it is noticable at all!) I added about 1 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips. I got impatient and stirred them into the warm butter-sugar mixture and got a little marbling. They came out PERFECT! My fussy family could not get enough and gobbled them up. I noticed that by watching them very very closely and taking them out the moment they were done I completely avoided the hard inedible edges that usually accompany brownie type bars. I am making these again!! This time with nuts and chocolate. Mmmm...heaven!",
