I've also found no difference in flavours or quality by NOT chilling/freezing the dough and also not letting the sugar mix sit for hours. You can do it all right away. I also only use a cup each of the fruits and find the extra 1/4 c of flour to be too much. Again all for my tastes. I always tell people make the recipe as is a few times get a feel for it then and have fun experimenting with it afterwards. Change up the nuts too. I usually use half walnuts and half honey-roasted pecans.",
