I used a meat mallet to crush the peppercorns but I think if you have a pepper mill using the \"coarse\" grind on it would work fine. I will say that the pepper is important in this hummus. Wouldn't change anything on this recipe it had the perfect balance of ingredients for us. JOEKLUGER thanks for sharing your recipe.",
