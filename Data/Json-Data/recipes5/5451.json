I hadn't thought to add honey or lemon juice. I am leaving a review to bookmark this. It works well because it is less acidic then other drinks and easy on the stomach. I drank it warm and with ice but preferred it cold. Doctors recommend juice be diluted for young children because of the sugar so mixing it with half water is a good idea anyway. I did that when I used to do daycare.",
