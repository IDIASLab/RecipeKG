I did at first (I figured baking was good enough for a Thursday night) but the chicken, while delicious, had that bland, boiled look. I threw it back in the oven before serving. Quickly browning up the top doesn't affect the flavor but makes for a much better presentation.",

The four chicken breasts, each over a 12 ounces, were marinated in a Ziploc bag for 45 mins. in the fridge. Breasts were moist and the broiling caramelized the  marinade and toasted the garlic which I made sure was placed on top of the chicken breasts.
