Followed the recipe pretty closely, except I found that I was out of honey so I used pancake syrup (imagine that!) and it worked out just fine.  I was going to double the gravy but that turned out not to be needed; there was plenty.  I may have added about 5 minutes to the cooking time to make sure the chops were cooked through. Very good and used ingredients I usually have on hand.  Thanks!!...10/15/08 an update:  I have to take back what I said about there being plenty of gravy.  The last two times I made this I doubled the gravy.  It's so good that my son smothers everything on his plate with it! ....Okay, one last update....I promise!: I make this about once a week now (usually with the original honey instead of the syrup I substituted once)) and have been adding just a few drops of Gravy Master to the gravy....looks more appetizing that way.
