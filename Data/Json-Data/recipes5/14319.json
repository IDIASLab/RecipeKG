While they were cooking, I added a little more butter (butter makes it better) and 4-5 dashes of cayenne pepper.  In addition, before adding the chile into the soup, I cooked it a little with some garlic and onion salt.  It definitely brings out more of the chile flavor when you do add it to the soup!  I should mention that I substituted all the various peppers for just Green Chile Peppers (not to be confused with bell peppers).",

I think the recipe should call for making some type of roux with the butter and vegetables, that would certainly help with the flavor.  However, there are way too many vegetables in the pan so making a roux is not possible unless you cook the veggies in batches.  And also very thin so maybe using heavy cream versus half and half would be better?  Also, I could feed my family of 5 for a month with the amount of soup this made.  Don't waste your time on this one.",
