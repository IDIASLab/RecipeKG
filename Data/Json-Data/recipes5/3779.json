It is my \"go-to\" recipe for bringing to new mothers, or families in need.  However, I substitute corn bread stuffing mixed with melted butter in place of the fried onions and cheddar cheese.  Trust me, the dish is still rich and satisfying.  Also, I use green peppers and fresh celery instead of pimento and celery seed simply because I tend to have these ingredients on hand.  Everyone who I have made this recipe for loves it and is very appreciative!",

I make several at a time without the cheese and freeze them in those new disposable plastic dishes that can go from freeser to oven (read the instructions on the plastic ware --preheating is REQUIRED).I take the still frozen dish and 1 cup of cheese to the sick person's home and tell them (or their family) how to cook it, and they can choose to use it WHENEVER they want.  This dish takes about the same amount of time to cook in the oven whether frozen or thawed before putting in the oven.  Great dish!",

I also add 4 hard boiled eggs cut up and 1 can cream of mushroom soup. Mix everything together the night before except cheese almonds and french fried onions. Refrigerate overnight to let the flavors connect. Then cook for 20 minutes at 400 before adding the \"toppings\" and cook for another 15 minutes unitl bubbly and brown. Excellent!! If you don't have french fried onions 1 c crushed potato chips work well too.",
