Left out the mushrooms due to the Mrs.'s faulty taste buds but other than that (and the addition of julienned red bell pepper) used the same ingredients though did not measure anything. I did not catch to add the pesto after cooking and I think I lost a lot of the flavor in the oven. I did marinate the fish in salt water for a couple hours and that flavor took nicely. The chili oil was HOT HOT before cooking but left only a slight - super slight - hint of it afterward. The fish texture was marvelous and the brine seemed to extract much of the fishiness from it leaving it smooth and buttery. Oh did not use any butter but added a little sesame oil to the potatoes but still my wife swore the entire dish had a wonderful buttery flavor. I expected something much more pungent but it was still quite nice never-the-less.",

Just a nice gentle kick - and make sure you warm the pesto before scooping over the fish. Great recipe and we'll definitely make again.",

I tried it out for the first time without having any idea how its going to taste... i took a risk to impress my father-in-law and it looked so gourmet and tasted fantastic that i think it worked! I served it w my own home baked multi grain whole wheat bread with olive oil dip... he liked it and went for seconds and it completely finished. I substituted the chervil with tarragon because i could not find it at the grocery store and i heard they are similar in taste though tarragon is stronger. and i used sesame chilli oil which was all i could find but it added a great flavor with 2 tbsp of pesto sauce on top. I think i added too much salt though and could've done with less. it was very quick to prepare and it took just 5 min each side to broil the fish.",
