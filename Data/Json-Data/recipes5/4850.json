This is a fantastic base recipe that you can tailor to fit your tastes bringing it up to 4 stars with little effort. I chose to use balsamic instead of rice vinegar and upped the quantity a tad and added a little garlic powder onion powder red pepper and cheese. Great way to use up leftover veggies.",

Next time will add more veggies and possibly feta cheese or sliced green or black olives (big sodium hit no doubt). The cucumber doesn't add much flavor so likely won't increase that but possibly more green onion and maybe try different herbs. This was my first taste of quinoa so wasn't sure what to expect other than knowing how good it is for you. It has a very light texture once cooked and nutty flavor. I was sold when I learned it can be cooked in a rice cooker (1 part quinoa to 2 parts water) which is how I cooked it for this recipe. Thanks zoeDisco for introducing me to quinoa!",
