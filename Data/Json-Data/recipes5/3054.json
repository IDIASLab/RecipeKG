Having said that as written this didn't work for me. Obviously one cup of sour cream per cuke is over the top & I added it a spoonful at a time until everything was just lightly coated. I liked the addition of mint that was a nice touch but after tasting I also added fresh dill & cracked black pepper. Not bad just not something I'll make again. Thanks for letting me try it though:o)",
