Everything comes quite well together here. I played around with this recipe and it is quite forgiving. I had to use buckwheat flakes instead of oatmeal and ended up having to use about 4 times the amount written. Evidently the two have different absorption qualities. I found that after letting the mixture set a while it firmed up to create a sturdy patty. I baked some \"meatball\" sized ones in the oven at 175\u00b0C for about 10-12 minutes. I flipped half of them halfway through. Any way you cook them, fried or baked, they come out perfectly; fried was just more flavourful. I served these with an assortment of homemade sauces like tartar, mustard and bbq and they went well with any sauce you dipped them in as well as being delicious on their own. Thank you MaryLou Hunter for your very nice recipe.",
