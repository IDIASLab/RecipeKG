Overall it got good comments around the table. \nUsed the exact ingredients but cooked it as a dressing in the oven (stuffing, BTW, is cooked in the bird, dressing is not). That may have contributed to it being a bit dry. I cook just about all dressing in the oven as we all like the crunchy bits that come from that. \nWill add it to my recipe stash for future Thanksgiving dinners, perhaps maybe add a bit more water to moisten it up. \nOverall a solid 4 stars.",
