Steam the broccoli for 1 minute, drain and put aside. This keeps the bright green color and will not be falling apart when you add to the main dish. The few adjustments I made here were to add fresh garlic and 2 to 3 TBSP. of oyster sauce to the broth mix. When it's complete, add about a tsp. or so of bottled teriyaki sauce. Mix. Add the broccoli. Mix gently.  No disrespect, but Americans usually overcook veggies and meats. It took me a long time to overcome. ",

My mom complained it was too sweet, I thought it didn't have any flavor, and my dad dumped so much chili sauce in it he couldn't taste anything.  My 18 month old ate a little bit, but my picky 8 year old neice said she liked it.  I tried adding real garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes, but it just still lacked something.  As my mom pointed out, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great either.  I will return to my usual recipe.",
