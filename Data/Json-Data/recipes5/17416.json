I also cut the cooking time in half that's very important. I started out at 400 for 10 minutes like the original directions suggest but then I only cooked them for another 10 minutes at 350 instead of 20 to 25. I've had one to eat already I didn't give it enough time to completely set so the filling was a bit runny still. They need a good hour before the syrup thickens. I had left over pie crust in the freezer from another recipe I worked with over Easter so all of this came together very quickly. I will make this recipe again but next time I'll trim my nails first - it was hard to press the crust into the tins without making slits hehe!",
