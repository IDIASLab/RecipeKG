I seared the chops on both sides, removed and kept warm on plate under foil, then deglazed the pan with the balsamic vinegar, adding the brown sugar and honey, and finally plums; I let the sauce cook for 15 minutes to reduce, stirring often, then added the chops back in for another 10 minutes or so, coating them with the sauce. I did not puree/blend the reduction. It's nice to have a chunkier, more chutney-like texture with meat.  Also, it's essential to reduce the ingredients to allow the full flavor to come through; a reduction brings the essential flavors out and concentrates them. Just thickening the sauce with cornstarch is NOT the same.",

The balsamic gave the sauce a wonderful bite and kept it from being overwhelmingly sweet. I did not add the optional blueberry juice but I would have if I had it. It's also a nice choice because it's not too labor intensive: once the pork goes into the oven it doesn't take very long for the sauce to reduce properly. All in all an deceptively simple meal that yields the look and taste of a restaurant quality dish!",
