I noticed the amount of water need in this recipe is missing, you should start with 1 cup of water, it shoud be absorbed by the time the tomatillos are golden brown.  Also some people like to add 1 bunch of chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.  But I like mine just how it is.  Also if you want a smoother version you could put it through the strainer after you blend it to get the seeds out.  Also if you dont want it that spicy you can use different chilies.  Jalapenos work well.  Also, do not drain the water, it should be mostly absorbed by the time your tomatillos are browned.",

I thought it had potential and after the changes I made it's now a 5 in my house. I increased the amount of peppers added cilantro and reduced the salt. This salsa had way too much salt.

I sauteed the garlic separately since I knew I wouldn't be able to strain it out of the water. As another reviewer suggested I added lime and some cilantro to mine once everything else is in the blender. Lime makes everything better. I probably used 3/4 of the salt. This salsa is very spicy in fact I don't think I've ever made one this hot. I'm a bit disappointed since I made this for a party and it might be too much for some people. I used 16 tomatillos 1 1/2 onions and 8 serranos and it was still very very hot. Next time I would only use 4-5 serranos but I like my verde salsa relatively mild to medium.",

This was only the second time I'd ever cooked with tomatillos and (I think) the first time I'd ever used serrano peppers. I made this exactly as written while cutting the \"salt to taste\" down to 1 T. instead of 2 - that sounded like way too much. Also I used a middling cooking time of 25 minutes. Hardly any water cooked off and though it was unstated I drained the vegetables after cooking (but saved about 2 T. of the cooking water to add to the blender). I was happy that this made a decently hot (but not blazing) salsa and that it had a decent thickness. I may just make this again soon - it was so easy and tasty.",
