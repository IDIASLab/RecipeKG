I also added pre-cooked mushrooms instead of onions.  I seasoned the chops with Montreal Steak seasoning.  I used sharp cheddar for more flavor and doubled what the recipe called for because I'm a cheese freak.  At the end of the baking process, I topped the dish with crushed croutons (I make homemade but I'm sure store bought would be great too) and instead of putting it under the broiler, I baked at 350 for another 15 minutes.  The potatoes were cooked and the croutons didn't burn.  The addition of the croutons definitely upped this from a 4.5 star dish to a 5 star dish.  Would not make it again without them.",
