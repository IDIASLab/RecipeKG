The flavors blend better using this method and there's only one pan to wash. A tablespoon of chili powder is nice and not to spicy.",

This is a little bit sweet, HOMEMADE \"hamburger helper\" that kids and, everyone that tries it, seems to like a lot. I do not use three pans to make, however.  I just re-use the macaroni pot and skip the boiling of the celery and green peppers and just add them to the browned and DRAINED ground meat: and cook til celery is tender. Then finish recipe, as stated. I believe it adds more flavor that way. This is great as a leftover! Thanks for the recipe!",

I ofcourse sprinkled some sharp shredded cheddar cheese to melt over my bowl but my boyfriend raved about this as it was! Thanks Sue! Your mom is a great cook!",
