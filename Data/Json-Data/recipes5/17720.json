It's super fast and easy - comes together quickly it bakes in no time (18 mins for me) and you frost it while it's still warm. You can whip it up while you're making dinner and it's ready to eat for dessert. Plus it's delicious. The icing is a great recipe in itself it would be a perfect chocolate donut icing. I made the recipe as written except I added a little Khalua and reduced the cinnamon by half. You could probably adjust the flavoring any way you like and get a tasty result every time. Great recipe!
