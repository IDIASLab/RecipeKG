I made the recipe as directed but halfed the chile powder because hubby isn't a fan of heat. I must state that I was not very impressed good lime flavour but not much else. No hint of the teriyaki and I feel that this recipe would be out of balance even with the extra chile powder because heat and acid don't balance well without sweet or creamy (oil)... The taste was very acidic and I countered that by reducing the marinade after removing the meat and straining out the other bits.. I added honey a lot of honey and served it along side the meat. I probably won't make this again because other recipe serve me better.. Lots of lime maybe some heat if that punches your buttons carry on..",

I didn't find that this marinade had a great deal of oomph even though I marinated for more than 24 hours (flat iron steak which is the only kind of steak we like). In the future I would vastly increase the ancho and add some garlic! But it is as advertised a simple marinade & it isn't overwhelmingly Asian-flavored (despite the teriyaki and ginger) at least on beef. I served this steak sliced into a greenleaf salad topped with Gorgonzola dried cherries and almonds. Thanks for the recipe!",

We actually liked these a little better but to be fair I didn't put enough seasoning in the other one. This has a mild lime flavor (I used the amount of lime juice indicated) but I thought it was screaming out for some brown sugar. I also used a teriyaki baste and glaze product for my teriyaki sauce and used cayenne pepper because I didn't have ancho chile powder. All in all this was ok but nothing we got excited about so I probably won't make it again. But it's always fun to try! Thank you.",

However I found it wasn't limey enough...next time I might use lime zest as well. You can leave out the green onions...there's enough onion and garlic in terriaki to cover that. And that amount of additional ginger seemed like overkill considering terriaki has ginger as well. I left most of the extra ginger out. As for amount of time in the actual marinade 1 hour per side of CHICKEN breasts was perfect. However for thinner cuts of BEEF/steak I would cut that in half as that amount of time started to pulverize the meat. If your steak is a thicker cut you might get away with 45 or 60 minutes a side but no more than that! As for taste with the beef it was perfect. So this recipe did ok for what it was supposed to be...however I was looking for minimal garlic and onions and I should've remembered terraki is full of them. I think I might experiment with just plain lime juice (and a little zest) next time with the ginger?",

I prepared exactly as written with the exception of just a litlle less lime juice than called for a smidge over a 1/4 cup and added some fresh lime zest. I will probably add a little fresh garlic next time missed that taste especially with beef. The lime taste really shines through this would be great for marinating meat for fajitas.
