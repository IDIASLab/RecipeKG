It is very versatile I like that the measurements of the ingredients can be adjusted to your preference (adjust the curry and chili sauce for level of heat).

I served it over noodles topped with chicken water chestnuts green onions red bell peppers chopped peanuts bean sprouts and cilantro. It got rave reviews at our dinner and I've referred 2 people already to this recipe. Thanks for sharing it!",

I used equal parts peanut butter coconut milk. Also I did not use the sweet chili sauce but the red chili paste because we use sweet chili sauce as the other condiment with the chicken skewers which we marinade with... did not use rice wine but substituted with red wine vinegar. This is excellent in a meal with chicken bentos rice and edamame super easy too (though it does have some ingredients that you might have to shop for). thanks to the submitter!",

                "reviewBody": "Followed the recipe except for omitting the fish sauce and using dried ginger instead of pickled, but something about the amounts seems off.  The peanut butter/coconut milk was way too thick. It didn't get melty as it heated, just seemed to get thicker (more so than the peanut butter right out of the jar. I used Skippy Natural). I ended up having to add lots more coconut milk just to get it close to the right consistency.  I think the extra coconut milk may have diluted the other flavors too much though because I found this pretty bland for peanut sauce. I like the ingredients and I will tinker with this recipe again, but I wonder if I'd be better off with doubling everything but the peanut butter?",
