I have made this now three times and it's always good. You can use apple juice instead of apple cider (the recipe is confusing here). I served it sliced and smothered with sauce on white-trash sesame seed burger buns for that southern BBQ (tailgate party) flavour. For side dishes I served a vinegar-based coleslaw and homefries (done in the oven). Brilliant. Will triple this recipe and have a -kicker BBQ this summer.",

Wonderful and delicious in every way.\n\nI don't grill so I used the oven broiler on low for about 10 minutes for that part.   My brisket was only 2 3/4 pounds and it still took 2 1/2 hours to cook to \"fork tender\".  \n\nThe BBQ sauce is good.  If you have some other kind you like, it wouldn't matter which you used.  Actually, the feedback I got was that it was not necessary at all.  It's perfect without it, if you're in a hurry.\n\nIf you don't cook brisket much, I suggest make sure the liquid (apple juice in this case) comes not less than 50% up the sides of the meat.  When you think it could be done, (I first check after about 45 minutes per pound of brisket) stick a big fork in it and if it goes through easily, it's time.\n\nThank you for a wonderful recipe!",
