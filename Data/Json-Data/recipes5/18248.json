Perhaps some all-spice?\" I marinated several chicken tenderloins in this for a little over a day and it was quite tasty. I know that the intention of the recipe was for a beef jerky and not \"Jerk\" as in \"Jamaican Jerk\" but I'm still thinking if I used this marinade again I would add 1/2 tsp. all-spice and maybe fresh green onion and minced garlic instead of the powders. I served the chicken perched atop fluffy coconut rice w/ green peas and lime wedges for a tropical flair in the midst of a chilly winter's night.",
