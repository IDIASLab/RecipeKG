I also added some garlic and onion powders to the marinade. The chicken was so moist and flavorful and the sauce was incredible. Thanks so much Dave!!",

As a note allow an hour to cook the chicken thoroughly - 35min is not long enough! In the end the taste was deep and rich but was missing a certain... sweetness I think? Perhaps the sherry was vital to the recipe I wouldn't recommend leaving it out (maybe more brown sugar or another sweet sauce).",
