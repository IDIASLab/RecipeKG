It was great.\nI would stick with the low sodium Soy sauce.  I didn't have any and figured it was just for health reasons that it was done with the low sodium soy. But it is just a tiny bit too salty with regular soy sauce.  \nI also goofed and cut the ribs only into 3rds rather then individually.  It was too late when I figured out my mistake. I was already browning them.  But worked fine, I doubled the sauce and just cooked them longer. About 2 1/2 hours at a really low heat.  \nThis is a keeper recipe for me.",
