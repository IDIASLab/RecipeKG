Followed recipe exactly as is but instead of grilling I baked it in the oven since it wasn't grilling weather outside. Very tasty with a bit of a kick. Even my son who doesn't care for overly hot spicy foods thought this recipe was a keeper. Definitely will make again but now I'll have to buy more harissa spice mix!",
