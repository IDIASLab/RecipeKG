I didn't use the optional chopped jalapenos because my 2 year old was eating this as well. Oh, and I did use the mild rotel instead of the regular to cut a little heat (again, for the little guy). I also added the beans in with the rest of the ingredients instead of waiting until the end and they cooked up fine with no mushiness or breakage. This dip is a new favorite in my house!

Picnic was rained out but I really wanted to try the recipe. Had not bought the jalapenos because kids and wimpy adults were in on the original plan. Any other time we a re big on thos little peppers.  I did up the amount of black beans just a bit because we love them and visually it looked more balanced color and texture wise. Did put the beans in at the beginning too. Will use this recipe again for sure with some fresh peppers and probably regular onion chopped coarse versus the little green ones. Probably will also try it with other meat options although chicken is my fav. I think it would be great as a filling for a wrapped in tortillas baked enchilada style dish but would then probably cut back on the  Velveeta style cheese so it is a bit firmer. The recipe as is, IS the bomb for a dip.    My husband and I are in heaven with a huge batch of this dip all to ourselves! ",

I think that really made the dish - it was nice and creamy and didn't have that overly Velveeta taste.  I didn't have any runniness issues.  I also used two cans of chicken.  It was very good but I am sure it would be even better if you bought and shredded a rotisserie chicken (which I will do next time if I have time).  I made it for a work function so I only added one seeded and diced jalapeno.  I served black olives, diced jalapenos, sour cream with diced green onions and parsely, and hot sauces on the side.  The black olives and diced jalapenos were particularly popular.  It was a huge hit and I got a lot of compliments.  I cooked for 1 1/2 hours on high and 1/2 on low.  The last 1/2 hour I was stirring about every 10 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe!",
