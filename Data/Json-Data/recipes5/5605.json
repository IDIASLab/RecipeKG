Instead of seasoning the chicken with the dry ingredients on the top I mixed them into the liquid. I had fairly thick chicken breasts so I cut them in half to make four thinner strips. I then dunked the chicken in the liquid spice mixture making sure to cover all of the chicken. I didn't have fresh lemons so I used 1/4 cup lemon juice. I think next time I would use a little more lemon juice and more of all the spices. I also didn't use bread crumbs and I'm glad I didn't because there was so much liquid they would have gotten soggy.",

It was super easy to make just had to make small changes due to the ingredients I had available but nothing major. Also didn't realize that this app adjusts the recipe to the amount of servings you add to it and since I doubled the ingredients on my own for 8 breasts the chicken seemed to be swimming in its cooking liquids. Next time I will be more faithful to the original recipe and then maybe all 5 of us will love it!",
