I think next time I make it I'll cut the lemon juice in half...it was just a little too bitter for me. The recipe suggests freezing if not using right away but I actually canned it in jelly jars. I also have made a good sugar-free barbeque sauce out of this catsup too. My recipe for that is: 1/3 C organic catsup 2 tsp Worcester sauce 1 1/2 tsp blackstrap molasses 1/4 tsp prepared mustard palmful of smoked paprika (you can use any smoke flavoring you want) 1/2 tsp baking cocoa Just cook it to barbeque sauce consistency. I was very happy with how this turned out. It stayed well on the chicken during grilling.",

However i did tweet the recipe to my liking. I used only Roma tomatoes two large onions 8 cloves of fresh garlic 3/4 cup organic apple juice that i had already canned tripled the cayenne pepper organic apple cider vinegar celery seed and peppercorns. I kept the whole cloves and bay leaf as is as they can become overpowering imo. I added 1 cup of fresh homemade maple syrup from this years harvest. I Omitted the lemon juice. Cooked on the stove top for two hours then i put it in a large crock pot with the lid off overnight. It turned out thick and wonderful. Then transferred it to my food processor to smooth all the lumps out. I added 1/8 tsp canning salt to each 1/2 pint jar. Sealed and hot water bathed for 10 min. I will never buy store catsup again! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe can't wait to make it again and again...",

The only things I did different was I blended the whole tomatoes with the onion and garlic in my VitaMix added another 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple juice and cut back on the lemon juice by half.
