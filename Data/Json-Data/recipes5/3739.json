The buttermilk really makes the chicken very moist and tender. Because I used the buttermilk I obviously didn't need the evaporated milk or the lemon. I used larger amounts of the seasonings plus a bit of cayenne and the chicken came out so delicious! Thanks Linda!",

As other reviewers did I used regular milk (instead of evaporated ) and only about half the salt. I also placed the chicken on a rack above a cookie sheet which allowed the chicken to bake up crispy on all sides. I used garlic flavored cooking spray which added a bit of extra flavor too. This also seems like a very versatile recipe where you could add different spices parmesan cheese etc. Thanks for the recipe!",

Like others have said you won't be fooled into thinking it's fried chicken but it's better than Shake and bake. The chicken had a nice crisp coating the breading stayed on and the meat was moist.
