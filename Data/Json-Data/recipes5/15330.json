There are a lot of ingredients, and a lot of steps, so this probably wasn't the best recipe for a weeknight, but I will make it again!  I was worried about the amount of heat, but it was mellowed out by the cooking and by the steamed white rice I served with it.  This is not a dish for people with sensitive palates or tummies.  Since we are in Texas, I could not find any fenugreek leaves, so I had to omit them.  Also, I used two jalapenos and one  Anaheim pepper, and cayenne for the ground red pepper. There was enough marinade for more chicken, and I used 1 1/2 pounds, but I think I could have used two pounds of chicken.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
