I decided to dig a hole and toss the seeds in my garden a couple of weeks ago and I have a couple dozen pepper plants coming up. Not sure what will become of them but it was fun.

Use ground beef and eliminate tostadas bread crumbs olive oil (unless using a real lean meat) essentially all the meatball stuff. Brown meat with remaining meatball ingredients. Combine sauce ingredients and cook together in a saucepan then combine with meat and serve over pasta. 1 or 2 pounds of meat? I don't know I'll have to figure that out. 1 or 2 pounds of pasta? Same thing. It's going to be fun working on this one!:-)",
