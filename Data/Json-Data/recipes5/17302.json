I went with other reviewers using only 2 tblsp cornstarch, and dark brown sugar has too much molasses for my taste so I always use light brown instead. Don't stint on the amounts of sugar and butter too much - they're the ingredients that make it \"butterscotch.\"\n Also, many cooks seem to be having a problem with lumps. Cornstarch has a nasty habit of lumping when mixed with sugar. You can eliminate them almost entirely by mixing the starch in well with the sugar and salt before adding the other ingredients. \n Lastly, instead of tempering the eggs, mix them well and add them, along with the milk, to the entire recipe before you even turn on the burner. Some recipes are fussy about when certain ingredients are added. This isn't one of them.\n Remember to stir *constantly* once it's on the burner or else the lumps you got rid of from the above step will come back to haunt you! -grin-\n Once again, this recipe makes a delicious pudding and Maryann, I thank you so much for submitting it. It's truly a favorite here at home.",

I mixed the brown sugar, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, and salt in a 1 quart saucepan, then slowly stirred in milk. I brought this to a boil over medium heat while I beat eggs in a smal bowl. When the sugar mixture came to a boil, I removed it from the heat and added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of it into the eggs, beating constantly, and poured everything back to the saucepan. Keeping on stirring, I brought this back to a boil, removed from heat, and stirred in butter and vanilla. It came perfect for me after cooking it this way. I hope it can help!",

Eggs have to be brought up to temprature VERY SLOWLY. A secret to good butterscotch flavor is browning the butter first in a small pan. Make sure it's a pan with a thick bottom. You don't want it to burn.",

A few tips....I used yellow sugar instead of dark brown and measured 3/4 cup loosely packed. I decreased the butter to a 2-ish tbsp. To keep the lump-factor to a mimimum, stir with a slotted wooden spoon or whisk. Remove from the heat to add the vanilla and butter. Even if there are lumps, keep stirring/beating/whisking...most, if not all, should disappear. The addictiviness (?) of this pudding is HIGH so beware!! Thanks Mary Ann.",
