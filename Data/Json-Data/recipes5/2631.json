You can fancy this up by using thinly sliced rib-eye or keep it budget with ground beef. Best of all, 30 minutes on the stove and you're done! I make this with Provel for that smoky/salty flavor, but if you're not a native St. Louisian and don't care for it, you can sub white American.",

The mushrooms I used were an 8oz can.  I used some liquid from it rather than open another can of broth, which there was too much of anyway - liquid, that is.  I think you could reduce liquid by 1/4-1/2c - or you could add more pasta, 2 ounces, which isn't a bad idea because there is a lot of sauce.  I used a 7oz package roast beef, sandwich type, & that was more than plenty.  'Only a pinch of thyme as a little is enough for me. \n Direction:  Sauteed onion till half way cooked, added pepper, mushrooms & spices for a few minutes.  Poured in liquids & pasta as directed.  Once heated, I added the roast beef cut into strips.  Covered & stirred occasionally.  Once pasta was cooked, gradually added the cheese - White American & Pepper-Jack.  E liked.",
