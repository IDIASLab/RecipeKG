Pros: Cinnamon topping was great and i added some crushed cardamom (black seeds only) to give it some kick! I added egg to make more cake like. Nice side thing for work party or potluck. I will try it again without egg. Cons: Cooked faster in my gas oven in 20 mins. it was done. Also don't be worried if 11x17 pan sounds too big when you are pouring batter in it was just right. Conclusion: Had to try this because it sounded so good. looks pretty with topping which was easy to roll in when bars just came out of oven. A few pieces did get wasted because mine got burnt due to time I had set for cooking.",
