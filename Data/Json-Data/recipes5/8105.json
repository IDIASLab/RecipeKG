                "reviewBody": "I would give this recipe 5 stars however my concern with this recipe if I understand it correctly is to grill the chicken breast on the un-sauced side leaving the sauced side up. After cooking the bottom of the chicken breast the instructions are to brush the cooked side with the remaining sauce. This would expose the cooked side chicken breast with a sauce and brush that has been exposed to raw chicken which could be harmful. Should you make this recipe I would strongly recommend halving the sauce in two different bowls one for the first application and another for the finishing topping. I would also clean the brush between applying. It is worth those extra steps because it is absolutely delicious. I made it on my cast iron grill on the stove which worked out fine.",
