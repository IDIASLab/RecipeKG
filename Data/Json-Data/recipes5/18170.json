I made two batches to compare and here are a few suggestions: use wheat bran, all bran doesnt give it the same consistency or flavor, add a little bit of cinnamon, add a little baking powder NOT baking soda (and make sure to sift both), beating the egg whites before adding them in gives the muffins a little extra lightness that is necessary. Add as many blueberries or fruit of choice that you want, they make them extra delecious!",

With minor changes I sell these muffins in my espresso bar to patrons looking for a slightly healthier treat with their java. Fun alterations I have made include substituting a cup of grated tart apple or pear for the berries using dried blueberries instead of fresh and adding cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. Also if you like nonfat yogurt can stand in for the applesauce. I highly recommend this recipe for a healthy breakfast treat.",

They came right out of greased muffin tins. I wouldn't use paper liners as these are somewhat sticky. I made only a couple of changes... used all whole wheat flour (HINT: get some wheat gluten from the store. It will help prevent HEAVINESS from the wheat flour and you will not need to increase the baking powder or soda. You can find it either in the baking aisle or the health food aisle. Use about 2 tsp. for this recipe). We added about 1/2 cup of finely grated carrot for fiber and sweetness upped the vanilla to 1 tsp. and added about 1/4 cup of Splenda just in case the frozen blueberries (use them frozen) weren't at the peak of sweetness. Oh yeah we used All-Bran cereal soaked in the milk instead of wheat bran. Anyway.... try these- they are wonderful. Would definitely make them again. Thank you for the recipe!",

I also added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed, doubled the amount of blueberries, added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and used Egg Beaters instead of the egg. I kept the 1/2 cup of white flour (instead of subbing wheat flour to make it even healthier), and I'm glad I did, because it helped keep the muffins a little bit fluffier/less dense, while only detracting a small bit from the overall nutrition of the muffins. A definite winner -- yum!",
