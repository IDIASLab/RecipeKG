We fried up three rounds of patties until we were satisfied and in the end it was delicious. I don't like venison and I'll be eating this sausage!

I really don't care for game meat but my husband is a hunter and I needed something to do with all the \"venison burger\" we have. This recipe is excellent! I did say I modified this a bit because I am allergic to pork. I omitted the pork and used a pound of ground venison we had frozen (I thawed it). I adjusted the spices a bit since the original recipe calls for more meat than I used. I also used some onion salt and fennel seeds ( a pinch). I used about 1/8 cup of brown sugar. I formed into patties (instead of freezing) and fried in a nonstick skillet with olive oil. There was no \"game\" taste to this and it is so tasty to me since I can't have typical pork sausage. Thank you for this recipe!!!",
