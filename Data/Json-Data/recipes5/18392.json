Marinated for 10 hours, it was good, and not overpowering, but I would prefer it to be a bit stronger - so I'll go for a full day next time. Also, I would probably add a 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard (Chinese or Goldman's), and a 1/4 teaspoon (maybe less) of apple cider vinegar - OR just  - increase the ginger a 1/4-1/2 teaspoon.  I put these in the oven on 425, for 25 minutes - probably could have taken them out around 20 minutes and tinfoiled them to rest for the last five minutes - use a thermometer, pork should be at 170, but I like to take it out around 160-165, and let it rest until it comes to temperature. Next time - I'll slice the chops into strips, marinade, bake, serve over rice sauteed with scallions, sesame oil, garlic and broccoli. Can't wait!",
