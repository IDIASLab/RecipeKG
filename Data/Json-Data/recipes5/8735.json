Part of the problem was I didn\u2019t have smoked paprika, my maple syrup was moldy and I had to use Aunt Jemima, and I substituted vanilla extract for whiskey because there\u2019s no booze in my house.  My daughter the vegetarian really liked it. I want to tweak the recipe a bit to adjust for the lack of whiskey.",
