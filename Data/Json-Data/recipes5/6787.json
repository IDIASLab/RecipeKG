It's a great way to use up your green tomatoes at the end of the season. You can also make a big batch and freeze it. It is a nice taste of late summer when it's cold out. I do have to say, I think this is good enough; I am looking forward to summer's first tomatoes that might just not get a chance to ripen!",
