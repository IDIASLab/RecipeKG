The only think I did adjust was the bananas (I ended up using three large overripe bananas, mashed and one regular banana, chopped). I ran the oats through my food processor to grind them down just a bit, for a finer consistancy, until it looked almost like a coarse wheat flour. We like the texture it adds to the baked goods. I also chopped my almonds as well. I made no other changes. I was able to get 12 muffins out of this recipe and I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. We really loved the different flavors and textures in this muffin. The oatmeal really went well with the orange, coconut and almonds. It was just lightly sweet, not overly so, and the muffin was just perfectly.......muffin-y. Out of twelve muffins, two remain. We REALLY enjoyed them. NOTE FOR ME: Next time, I'll try to make this a little lighter/healthier by using half whole wheat flour and substituting unsweetened applesauce for one of the eggs and part of the butter.",

But as is they make for a FANTASTIC breakfast muffin. The only thing I did different was to add a bit of coconut extract to accent the shredded coconut and I also added a bit of freshly grated nutmeg. Oh and I toasted the almonds before adding to the batter. D-E-Licious! Definitely a keeper.",
