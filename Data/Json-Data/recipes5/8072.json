Experiment with the solid and liquid ingredients so you get the soupiness or stewiness to your liking. You can throw just about anything into the pot and it will be delicious! I'm not much for measuring, so use your best judgement with proportions and seasonings, and don't forget to taste along the way. Garnish with cilantro and sour cream or plain yogurt.",
