I was worried that my missus wouldn't like the olives or lemon juice but they were just the right amount for her that she actually commented about it. And I have more of a sour/salty taste than my missus but it was just enough for me too! We did have fresh from the garden tomatoes so that helped and I had to use two pita halves to make wholes. It's all my store had. We WILL make this again and I might try to incorporate some capers with it just to try. Thank you Lela for another great recipe!",
