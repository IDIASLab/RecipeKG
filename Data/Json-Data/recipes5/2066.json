I love tuna though so I thought I'd add this to my list of new attempts...(bein' used to noodles or biscuits instead of potatoes):o). I have to say I'm glad I made this. It took a little longer than the few minutes for the cream mixture to thicken and you must be a speedy preparer Janet but in the end it was very tasty and my husband loved it too! I walked my dog and came home to a lovely aroma in the house. I added a picture because it was worth it! Thanks for posting this janet7th! I'll definitely make it again!",
