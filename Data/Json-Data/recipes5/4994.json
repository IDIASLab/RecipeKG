It turned out very watery and the dressing just sunk to the bottom of the plate not sticking to the greens. Could be that just using the tomato pulp (no seeds or juice) would help cut down on the liquid a little. For us it was too tart so I added a little sugar to counterbalance the sourness. If I were to make again I would probably try less cider vinegar or just use something a little milder like white vinegar but less than 6 tablespoons. The pureed tomatoes and onion do add a layer of texture which is nice. It also makes quite a bit of dressing more than 10 servings IMO but we don't eat our salads loaded with dressing either. I may try again with the modifications mentioned above but will only make half a recipe next time.",

For me I think this would be better with a large tomato and either all balsamic or all cider vinegar. For me the two vinegars fought for control flavor-wise. I think it could use a little more garlic too. The husband and kids haven't had theirs yet I'll update my review once they have. EDITED: Husband and one kid didn't care for it--oldest boy liked it a little more than everyone else but not by much. Again I think this could be really good if I tweaked the recipe a bit.",
