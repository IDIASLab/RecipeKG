And by wrong, I mean any scallops that have been soaked in a preservative brine. These are easy to identify, as they're usually sitting in a pool of milky liquid. What you want are usually sold as wild 'day-boat,' 'diver,' or 'dry-pack' scallops. They are really expensive, and worth every penny. Serve with French bread for dipping.",

The second time I made this, I added a few drops of Bristol Cream sherry to the sauce mix. It gave an unbelievable depth of flavor. We served this with Steamy Microwave Zucchini.  That recipe is on this site. The third time I made it, I put a slice of whole grain Oatnut bread on the bottom of the serving plates, topped it with the zucchini, and poured the baked scallop gratin over the top of each serving. The sauce from the gratin flavors the zucchini and soaks into the bread. This is a wonderful low calorie one-dish meal that is quick to make and everyone loves it.",

I asked him if there was anything about them he didn't like, the answer was NO. When I asked him if it was a 5-star recipe, he said YES. I had to agree with him. I couldn't get fresh tarragon at the grocery store, but since I don't care for tarragon, I wasn't too disappointed and picked up some fresh marjoram instead. I have to say that homemade creme fraiche makes my heart sing, so I loved that part of the recipe. I forgot to pick up a lemon at the grocery store, and today being Good Friday, everything was closed. I went to our local fish and chip store out of desperation and asked if they would sell me a lemon, and they gave me one, no charge! I knew the recipe would have missed the lemon zest. The scallops were delicious, but I thoroughly enjoyed dipping the French bread in the sauce. It was pricey, but it was worth it. What a treat!",
