I use medjool dates which as far as I know are the moistest and sweetest and I'd recommend putting 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 cups of dates instead of 1 cup (if you love dates). I put 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup white flour which I think makes it less pudding-like and more cake-like. I also make mine in an 8X8 inch pan so I cut the bake time down to 35-40 minutes and I even put the temp down to about 390 instead of 400. It comes out really nice. It's still sort of plain and not very sweet but if you like that kind of thing you'll like this.",

Lovely luke warm but even better straight from the fridge. I put the cake in the fridge to cool then slice it with a really sharp knife as it may crumble if not really cold. Then have a slice when you fancy. Fantastically firm and morish without being too hefty. I have deviated from the recipe at times and added more fruit like raisins and dried apricots. The apricot one was a winner. I think it is because of the soaking period and I have soaked it for up to an hour at times making it really moist. Doubling the amounts I get three small bread loaf tins out of it excellent for freezing. My favourite!",
