The taste was good.  I might fry them a little hotter next time to create a crispier exterior.  \n\nNote:  I would suggest not placing them on a paper towel lined plate as mine stuck to it!  I am always in favor of trying to remove excess oil but will try a way other than a paper towel next time.",
