And she also used to call it Swamp Water It was my absolute favourite back then. I haven't had one in years but now that you have reminded me I think I will have to make some soon! Thanks!",

But more important not only was it unattractive it didn't taste good either. More orangey than cola-y but the combination of two acidic beverages was too much. I certainly had an open mind but this was not a good match. I'm SO glad I only made a half recipe. Update: While I still stand by my original 2-star rating and review Hubs has since tried this and had a different opinion. He said \"It's horrible to look at it but if you shut your eyes it's strangely refreshing.\" That was after he had me mix up a second glass of it for him. Since he pronounced it as good and four stars I must revise my rating to reflect the average between us - three stars.",
