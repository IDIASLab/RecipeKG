I used 1/4 cup minced green onion, 1/2 cup ham, and omitted the nutmeg. I think pie crust takes away from the quiche, so I do a quick spray with olive oil flavored cooking spray in the quiche pan, then dust it with 2T cornmeal.Second time around, I used 1/2 whipping cream, and 1/2 half and half. Great both ways, but creamier texture with whipping cream/half and half. Yummy!",

I did find this to be a little too salty (maybe my ham?) so I'd omit it and salt at the table.",

I even used a store bought crust - which I normally don't do. I also used fat free half and half instead of the milk I often use it for cooking and it tasted great.

Also you want to pre-bake the frozen crust for 10 minutes to avoid sogginess. I added garlic powder (1 tbl.) and cayenne (1/2 tbl) as recommended. I used half and half instead of milk and cut it down to 1 1/2 cups. There is no need to heat the egg and milk mixture before pouring it on top of the cheese/ham mixture.

I made a test run today and used store bought crust to line the pan. I did keep it in the oven an extra 10 or so minutes in order to get the golden color. Absolutely perfect looking and tasting.

All the quiches I've made in the past you just poured the egg/milk mixture in on the filling ingredients and popped it in the oven. With this recipe I spent at least 30 minutes at the stove just stirring the custard until it began to thicken and I was starting to think it NEVER was going to show signs of thickening! I used more than 1/3 cup of ham that sounded like way too little I probably used about a cup of diced ham (from a ham steak) which I browned in a skillet until all the excess water cooked out of it (it would have left my quiche pretty runny if I hadn't done that). I also added some sauteed mushrooms. I had maybe 1/2 cup more egg mixture than would fit in the crust because of the extra filling ingredients. The 30 minute cook time was perfect I had brown crust and the egg filling was set. You do really have to spend some time cooking that filling on the stove over low heat though to get it to the point that it's beginning to thicken. I am not entirely sure that the result was worth the extra effort but it was a very nice textured quiche.",
