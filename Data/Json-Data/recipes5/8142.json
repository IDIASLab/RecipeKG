It's a great base recipe but it definitely needs some seasonings as it was quite bland - in the very least some salt and pepper. Garlic would also add a nice touch. Thankfully I had made some gravy so it added some flavor to the dish. The oatmeal flavor was quite prominent (not in a good way) so I would suggest cutting it back to 3/4 cup. For one pound of meat 1.5 cups of oats is a lot but I wanted to follow the recipe as written. This could be a four to five star recipe with some tweaks. It's very moist! Thanks for the recipe!",

I never make meatloaf but wanted a new ground beef recipe so with a few tweaks I think this came out pretty good! I reduced the oats to 3/4 cup like other reviewers said and I omitted the French onion soup mix (to reduce the sodium content and well because I don't own that!). Then I added several dashes of pepper garlic salt and garlic and sprinkled in a few teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce. The first time I made this I added cayenne pepper for some spice but it turned out way too spicy so I left it out the second time. Also the first time I baked it for the 1 hour and it came out WAY dry (not sure if it was my oven or the fact I used a dark pan). I baked for 45 minutes instead this time around and it was perfect! Like I said good easy base recipe!",

The reason I was looking at this recipe at all was because I wanted to make meatloaf but was out of breadcrumbs and needed a substitute.  I tried the oatmeal in the lesser amount that was suggested by other reviewers with my regular recipe plus I add about 1/4C ketchup to the mix as well.  They I take about 3/4 C ketchup 4 T of brown sugar and a splash or two of Worchestershire sauce and mix for the topping.  I put this on about 15 minutes before taking the meatloaf out and I cook at 350 so it doesn't dry out.  My kids and their friends (who don't like meatloaf) rave about it and the oatmeal was a great substitute.",
