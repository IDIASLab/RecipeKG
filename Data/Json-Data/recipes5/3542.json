I left out the pimento, which I don't care for, and finely chopped some plain pickle for the relish.  Everything else as is.  This was pretty good and tasted much like a tuna salad, but I liked that it was moist, unlike a lot of tuna salads.  If I make again I'll probably halve the peas.  I don't like peas, but they're good for me so I'll take advantage of the opportunity to get them inside me hiding in a spoonful of something else, cause they're kinda inconspicuous that way. :-)  But ... too much.",
