I didn't have any chives, green onions or fresh tomatoes, so instead I mixed around a 1/2 cup of medium salsa in with the fat-free refried beans when I microwaved them and then left out the hot sauce. Instead of pkgd. taco seasoning, I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe on this site which is a 1000x better. However, I did not add the ingredients to the seasoning that were already called for in this recipe (like chili flakes and pepper). I left out the olives because I don't like them. Not having to chop anything up saved about 10 minutes on the total time, and I even grated my own cheese while the beans were heating up. I will definitely make this again.",
