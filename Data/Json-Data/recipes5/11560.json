We prefer more bell peppers and onions in our potatoes so we left it as the recipe called for, possibly would add more bell peppers in the future.\n\nThe spice was great, left that alone. Coming out of the oven the potatoes had too much moisture and were mushy so I broiled them for 5 minutes to crisp and that worked to give a slight crisp to the edges.\n\nDid not have fresh Basil but we did have Rosemary in the garden so I used that and it worked nicely. Will try Basel next time and see which we perfer.",
