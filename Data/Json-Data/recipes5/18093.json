Only changes:  Used 3 Granny Smith apples & added a few drops of lemon juice, 1/2C of pecans (no raisins) and sugared the pastry before adding the apples.  Brushed pastry after it was rolled with melted butter and then sugar. Seems like a lot of sugar but the apples I used were pretty tart and needed it.  (And we aren't hugh sweet eaters.) Mine have cooked in about 12-15 min...maybe it's just my oven, but I would watch to make sure not to burn bottoms.  VERY, VERY GOOD & EASY.",

Only used 1/3 cup sugar (subbed a couple delicious apples in place of granny smith) and added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a little melted butter. Only used 1/4 cup regular raisins. Can't imagine using a full cup of sugar AND that many raisins - would've been way too sweet. Also didn't want to waste an egg for the wash so I just sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar on top after baking. Made a few slashes on top to vent before baking and covered my cookie sheet with no-stick foil. Will make again for sure.",

Here is how I modified the recipe for our taste: 3 apples 1/2C raisins 2/3C brown sugar 1t cinnamon 2T Minute Tapioca. I used the puff pastry egg and 1/4C milk as listed but added sliced almonds on top as others suggested. I also took the suggestion of cooking the apples brown sugar cinnamon and tapioca in a sauce pan for 15 minutes on medium heat. Baking time was only 25 minutes in the oven. Three apples makes enough for 2 strudels. When they came out of the oven and cooled a little I sprinkled them with powdered sugar. Simply delicious for dessert or breakfast.
