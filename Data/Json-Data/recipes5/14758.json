I adapted it a little to my taste by adding more cilantro and garlic and adding some ground cumin.  When choosing your avocados choose ones that are blemish free and have a slight give when squeezed lightly.  There are so many different varities that color is not a good indication.  Sure this has a lot of fat in it, but it's the good fat that our bodies need to keep are skin supple and our joints lubricated (tell that to my hips!)!\n\n07/07/08 Update\nI just had to update my review on this recipe.  My first review was the first time that I had made this recipe - now I am known for my guac!  I don't use a recipe any more, but it is similiar to this.  I think the key to delicious guac is lots of garlic and a lot of lime juice.  The lime juice does more than flavor the quac - it keeps it from turning brown.  I also add jalepenios (sp?) seeded, ribbed and finely chopped for a little heat.  Another thing I add is some cumin - one of my favorite spices.  Teh quac I make is chunky, but chunky from the tomatoes, onion and peppers - the avocado I make very smooth.  You don't want to make this too soon as some discoloration can occur.  I have made it the night before and it's fine but I prefer to make it a few hours before hand.  That way it stays nice and fresh but the flavors have time to marry.  Regardless of when you make it always flatten the top surface smooth and squirt the jui",

I scaled the recipe down (using only 1 avacado) because it was just me eating this. Instead of chopping up the onions and garlic, I used onion and garlic powder.  In my opinion, they taste just as good and are much quicker.   I also added a spoonful of salsa to mine.  I love eating this alone with chips or as a side dish to my lunch or dinner.  Thanks for sharing.  Will definitley make again!!",

Also, be wary of over mashing the avacado - I thought I didn't like it chunky, but smooth becomes kinda soupy.  With the whole lime, this doesn't turn brown for over 24 hours in a sealed container.  Best to eat immediately (or after chilled for an hour), lots of liquid pools in it after a couple days. UPDATE:  Do not freeze this to use at a later time ... the consistency is just strange after thawing and the flavors change.  Still the best Guac, though. :)\n\nThank you for a great addition! :D",

On the rare occasion there are leftovers, mixed-in tomato makes the guacamole go off faster. Same amount of work, just throw the tomatoes in a separate bowl and toss some extra onion, chili, cilantro, and lime. *Lime acts like salt on the palate, so add salt after the lime juice; you will end up using less. *I always add some ground toasted cumin seed and a seeded jalapeno. *Great with and without garlic. *Reserve half the avocado chunks to add at the end for textural variety. *The most important thing, though, is to use ripe avocados. Buy them a day or 2 beforehand, then let them sit in a brown paper bag on the counter with a ripe apple, pear, or bananas until the avocados are softer. *If the avocados aren't perfectly delicious, I add a little extra virgin olive oil to the mix.",

We like chunkier style Guacamole so mashed two of the avocados & chopped the third into very small pieces. These pieces will mush up alittle as you stir in other ingredients, but still give it alittle chunk. If it is still too chunky you can mash it alittle with back of spatula. I will use this recipe on a regular basis. Thanks!",
