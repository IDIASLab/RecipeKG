I of course had to adjust the measurements of the juices a bit to get the frosting to the perfect consistency (no recipe for frosting can be precise so should not be criticized if more or less powdered sugar or liquid needs to be added). This is a light fluffy citrus frosting that was the perfect choice to frost Rainbow Citrus Cake also from this site.",
