This is an excellent salsa and the taste is truly unique and satisfying. Since \"salsa\" means sauce in both Italian and Spanish it makes sense that this dip bridges the two cultures as well. I chopped the ingredients up in my food processor for a more minced-like texture and then poured the salsa over some plain broiled chicken. Then of course I popped out the tortilla chips and we all chowed down. Wow what a taste experience!",
