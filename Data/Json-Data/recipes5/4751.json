Pretty sophisticated stuff, but not expensive to prepare.

Next time I would chop all of the onion somewhat larger.\nI made 1 1/2 times the basting sauce (and used white cranberry juice instead of lemon juice) and stock, but it makes a lot of sauce.

                "reviewBody": "We had never roasted duck before.  For a Christmas dinner for six, we roasted two six-pound ducks following this recipe with only a few changes.  Our ducks were already heavily browned after a half hour, so we lowered them in the oven and covered them with foil.  We removed them from the oven after two hours when the thermometer read 172 degrees F.  In retrospect, we probably should have cooked them longer because the flesh around the bone, though warm, was still reddish pink.  Our stuffing included cranberries, and we sauteed the onions.  Everyone raved over the recipe, which we joined with sauteed brussels sprouts, sauteed spinach, garlic mashed potatoes, red wine, and flan.\n\nAnother change we made was to add a second sauce made from a reduction of about one-third cup of balsamic vinegar, one-third cup of raspberry preserves, a splash of red wine, and a splash of chicken stock with salt, pepper, and cinnamon.  (Next time I would probably thicken with cornstarch.)  Boil, then reduce the heat and strain the mixture to remove the seeds.  Our guests preferred this more pungent sauce for the duck.\n\nThank you Adams Family.",

The only thing I did different was make stuffing with the raisin mixture. I was in a hurry shopping  and grabbed cranberry juice infused raisins (never even heard of that) and it tastes even better. I might even make this for every holiday:) it's a little time consuming so, next time I'll debone the duck so it cooks faster. Seriously, anyone reading this you have to use this recipe! It's so simple especially if you like to cook!",
