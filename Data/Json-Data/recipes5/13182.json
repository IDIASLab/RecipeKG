I used chutney for the jelly since I forgot that I gave it to a friend and also used Asiago cheese that I just added in one inch squares to the pot. I used the crock pot. Tonight for leftovers I added saute' mushroom and garlic and it was even better. Served with organic rice from Aldis and peas. I will definitely make it again and maybe add some meat. If you don't have coconut milk make it anyway since we couldn't even taste it.",
