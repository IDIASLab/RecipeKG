In the end I like to make the real recipe as is so the only \"change\" was making my own Taco Seasoning and I had no tomatoes so I opened a can of stewed tomatoes and used that. I sprinkled a few green onion pieces on top after it came out of the oven for a little color pop. TERRIFIC! I wouldn't change anything a nice kick without burning. I served with Fritos.
