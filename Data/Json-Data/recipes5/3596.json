I think that your version has a very distinctive ginger taste (I'm assuming from the miso paste) that is present in the restuarants' \"ginger sauce\" not in the \"egg yolk\" concoction that goes on top of the shrimp or lobster as it is cooking. Maybe I'll tinker with it because it is close. Thanks;)",

When we found this recipe we tried it with just egg yolk, veg oil and not quite all of the Miso Paste (found at an international grocery store in the dairy section of all places). The key really is in the stirring. Then it works well to let it sit in fridge overnight. We love it! Thank you!",

The only thing I omitted from the recipe was the \"1/4 teaspoon grated yuzu (Japanese orange), lemon or lime peel\".
