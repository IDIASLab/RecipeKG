I used a ginger snap in the bottom of a cupcake liner and then filled it about 3/4 full of filling. I cooked it for about 14 minutes and then added the topping. I cooked it for about 4 more minutes. So, so yummy! The cookie softens a little and makes a perfect no fuss crust. I did not need extra topping, in fact I had a little left over.",

I didn't find the topping to be enough to cover the cheesecake so I doubled it and it was great. I also made my own graham cracker crust and pressed it into a springform pan which gave it an authentic cheesecake presentation. The pumpkin butter is divine and can be used on just about anything... I made only half of what the recipe called for in the other entry and served it with some scones that I had made for breakfast Thanksgiving morning. Everyone raved about the pumpkin butter in the morning and when I served the cheesecake that night I told them I used the same butter to make the cheesecake - they said that stuff should be bottled and sold! FABULOUS RECIPES ELEANOR! Thank you so much for sharing!!!",

First I doubled the whole recipe so I could make a larger dessert. Used a 9\" spring pan with a graham cracker crust made with 1 1/2c crushed crackers 1/2c butter and 1/2c white sugar. I didn't pre-bake the crust and just put the filling right in on top. I baked it at 325 for one hour with out a water bath. When the 1 hour was up I added the double topping mixture and baked for five more minutes to set the topping and melt the sugar. Turned the oven off and run a knife around the edge of the pan a put back in the oven to cool and set for 5 hours. Put in the fridge over night and enjoyed the most wonderful flavors this evening at a party. The pumpkin butter was so good here. There were no leftovers! BTW. I got the baking idea (cooling in the oven) from another cheesecake recipe on this site and used it because of the good success of cheesecakes with out the usual cracks in the top and no water bath to mess with.",
