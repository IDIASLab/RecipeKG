I think this would be a good spread on a sandwich as well as on a salad.  So for me, this was thumbs up!  Thanks, lukeder101!",

I can t think of anything worse in a salad dressing than to have it too acidic too tangy and after looking over the measurements of the ingredients I could see this would be the case here. In order to avoid that I adjusted the oil/vinegar to the 3:1 ratio I prefer. (i.e. I added a little more olive oil). I thank Hubs for us enjoying this as much as we did. The oregano didn t appeal to me and I had planned to omit it but he encouraged me to include it. I m lucky to have fresh herbs in my garden right now oregano one of them. I used three times the amount of the dried oregano called for. It was a great addition that gave the dressing a little more character. Adjusting the olive oil/vinegar ratio as I did elevates this to 5-stars.",
