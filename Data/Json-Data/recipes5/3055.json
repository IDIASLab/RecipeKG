I killed two birds with one stone here entry for a no picture recipe and something hubby can enjoy and stay on his diet with I used fat free no low fat added an extra tsp. of lemon juice and will cut back on the Splenda some the next time. I use my stick blender in a tall glass to blend this; it made it so easy. It tasted better then the store bought fat free sour cream and I can eat the cottage cheese with peaches or pineapple. So it saves me money. Thank you very much Brenda.",
