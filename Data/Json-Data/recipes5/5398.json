Also, I added about a tbsp. of the tzatziki sauce to the beef and an egg to bind. In retrospect, I should have added some breadcrumbs. My burgers were on the softer side, so don't expect a firm texture like you get with regular burgers. Hubby loved the flavor, but would have liked a more firm texture. To replicate gyro style, we added a sliced tomato to the bun, beef patty on top, topped with a bit of tzatziki sauce. We don't like onions, but for those that do, an onion slice added to the burger would probably be good too. Yummy change of pace from regular burgers.",
