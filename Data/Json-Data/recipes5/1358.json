Chopped the asp. into 1 in. pieces and boiled it in my pasta water for a few while it came to a boil.  Then I drained it into a bowl so I was able to reserve the hot water; then added the pasta back to it.  Grilled my chicken breast seasoned w/ poultry seasoning, s&p. on my little indoor grill for a few,(I like the chix to have a little golden color) then cut it up & added it to evoo that had been sauteeing garlic and onion.  Added the chix, asp., sqz of lemon juice, chopped a few roasted red peppers (out of a jar, \"RAO'S\" brand.. yum)  1/2 of a chopped tomato, 1/4 cup of chix broth, about 1/4 cup of cream cheese and a spash of milk & parm chz.  That really helped make it creamier, although there still wasnt too much sauce, but thats fine w/ me. Makes it feel \"lighter\"!  Thats about it, I snuck in a few red pepper flakes & tossed it all w/ the pasta!  Perfect!  My kids gobbled it down w/out complaint!  Although they are pretty good eaters.  Their favorite food is calamari, and they love the tenacles! My friends are soo jealous of how my kids eat!  Guess I'm doing something right!  Enjoy!   Laura from AZ ",

I didn't have any chicken broth so I threw in a cube of chicken bouillon to 1.5 cups of water. When the pasta is mixed in the penne drank up all of the broth - so there was really no sauce. I offered crushed red peppers on the side for the adults and plenty of parmesan for the kiddos! And everyone was happy!",

After I cooked the chicken ( I marinated it in italian dressing before cooking) I cooked the asparagus in 1 c broth, minced garlic, salt and pepper but only for like 3 minutes because I wanted it pretty crispy.  Then I sprained out the asparagus, leaving broth in the sauce pan and added 3 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese and about 1/4 cup milk.  I whisked this until smooth then added the chicken and asparagus then coated it.  Then I added the pasta and topped with more parmesan cheese.  I seriously had 3 helpings of it and want to eat more.  I am going to try it the original way next time, but for a wintery comfort food it was AMAZING (if I do say so myself)!",

I wasn't going for \"light\", I was going for delicious.  I added fresh broccoli in addition to the asparagus (yay veggies!).  Instead of cubing the chicken I sliced the breasts in half so they'd be thin.  I sauteed the salted and peppered chicken with onion and plenty of freshly minced garlic cloves in olive oil.  I also used a lot more chicken broth (didn't use low sodium)- at least a cup.  I also took the plunge and added Philadelphia cream cheese (quite a bit).  Next time I will add even more broth and cream cheese so it has more sauce.  One reviewer recommended added a splash of milk as well and I think I will try that next time.  The creamy sauce is great, and I love having tons of asparagus and broccoli in with the chicken and pasta.  This also froze and reheated well.  It's good stuff, enjoy!",
