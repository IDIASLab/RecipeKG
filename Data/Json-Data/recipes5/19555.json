Using bone-in thighs, I removed the skin, trimmed the fat, and seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper. Then, I just mixed all the other ingredients (minus butter because I didn't cook the onions beforehand) and poured it over the top and baked it at 360 for about an hour (just until the internal temperature reached 170). Cranberries were WONDERFUL in this, and the meat was so tender and flavorful just like it was slow-cooked. went with steamed rice. DELISH! Update: passed this recipe on to my friend who is a beginner cook and she said \"it was a hit\" with her family. Thanks again for posting this. I now keep whole cranberry sauce as a \"regular\" stock item in my pantry!",

I used the chicken breasts and baslamic vinegar (didn't have red wine vinegar) after I read what misscarolb wrote as corrections to the original recipe she submitted. I cooked everything at 350 because I used boneless breasts and a pyrex dish. I forgot to add the brown sugar but it didn't need it as it was very sweet without it. I misread the recipe and took the onions right out after cooking them at the beginning for 15 min. and put them into the sauce but it still tasted fine. I turned the chicken in the butter so both sides got some and baked covered with foil for about 20 min. Then I put the sauce on and baked covered about 10 more minutes. I took the cover off for the remainder of the time until the chicken was 165 F inside. Lots of delicious sauce. Great with rice.",
