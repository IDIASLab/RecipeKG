The eggs turn a lovely brown color and have a consistency similar to boiled eggs. The insides have a tinted brown color, too. Reduce cook time if you prefer a softer boiled egg.",

Overall, taste was awesome with just a bit of salt, next I will try devilled eggs!! The only slight negative was the very outside of the egg was a bit dry, but they did 2 hours in the smoker so it\u2019s more than expected!",
