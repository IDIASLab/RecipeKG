                "reviewBody": "This is a great recipe. Regarding the low review: because there is no oil or butter in the recipe the moisture content of the dates is very important in how \"luscious\" this cake is. I get a tub of dates at Costco and I dig out the stickiest most moist dates in the tub and use for this recipe. This is especially important for the drier 'Deglet Noor' variety of dates. If you can get your hands on very fresh 'Medjool' dates the recipe is phenomenal. In summary don't use dried up dates because most of the moisture in this cakes derived from the dates and if the dates aren't moist then the cake will be dry. If this were truly a bad recipe it wouldn't be rated so high. This is a case where the quality of ingredients counts. I have made this a few times and I am comfortable changing it up a little depending on what I have on hand. It's great as-is but I like it with a handful of Guittard milk chocolate chips and/or a handful of Baker's coconut too! People who have never eaten dates before rave when they try this cake!",
