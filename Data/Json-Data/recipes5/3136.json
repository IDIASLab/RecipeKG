Instead of baking it the whole way we also microwaved the cream cheese sour cream etc together until it was heated through and smooth then put it in the bread and sprinkled the cheese over it threw it in the broiler for a few minutes until the cheese got melty and bubbly. MMMMMMM it was good. I looked away and the whole loaf bread and all was gone. Also the store didn't have sourdough so I used pumpernickle. Easy to make easy to eat easy to clean up (ya eat the bowl!)
