I thought the cream cheese/mushroom filling was good but I didn't like the dijon taste or the walnuts. Also I found it to be a huge pain to assemble. Even with the chicken breasts pounded flat the cream cheese and mushrooms kept oozing out. This made it extremely difficult to get it into the mustard/brown sugar mixture which was also a big gooey mess. Not at all worth the effort.",

I halved all the other ingredients and the proportions came out perfect. I also omitted the nuts because I didn't have any on hand. However the recipe made pretty tastey and unique chicken. I absolutely love the cream cheese and mushroom combination. I think I might make hors oeuvres with them the next time we have guests. My only complaint with this dish is that the brown sugar/mustard sauce did not quite go with the flavors going on with the cream cheese/mushrooms. The sugar seemed to compete with the cheese but would probably go great on the chicken alone. I would have much preferred a white wine sauce lemon sauce or an alfredo sauce to compliment this dish.",
