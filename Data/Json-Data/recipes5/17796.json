Golden Delicious is the best type to use since it's texture and firmness is similar to the Sweet Potato.  Definitely BAKE your potoates first (locks in the sweetness and vitamins!), cool, then slice.  I also sliced my apples, then cut again into bite size pieces and it cooked perfectly.  No need to layer the sugar in between.  Just melt the butter (1/2 c. is enough)& spices and drizzle over the top.  Good dish to make ahead of time and put into the fridge.  Just let it sit at room temp. for a few hours before baking and you're good to go.  This is such a nice change from the marshamallow topping and so much lighter!  I always get raves and requests for this dish, which I've been making for the past 5 yrs.  Try it!",

Cool, peel and slice into greased casserole dish. Using only 1/2 cup of brown sugar total, mix remaining ingredients except apples and butter.   Top potatoes with 1/3 sugar mixture. Mix apples (1/4 inch slices cut into 8 pieces each) with the remaining sugar mix, spread over potatoes. Drizzle the melted butter over the top. Bake for 20 min, stir gently and drizzle with 1 Tablespoon melted butter if mixture seems dry. cook 15-20 minutes more.  Great flavor combo!",
