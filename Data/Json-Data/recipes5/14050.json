We eat everything with plain yoghurt and this is one of those dishes that is out of this world with yoghurt, salt, and a side of a cucumber salad.\n\nKeep in mind, your whole house will reek when you cook this, so make sure you have good ventilation!!!",

I would have rated it a 5, but my husband said he would have given it a 3 (He isn't very familiar with lentils - not that there was a problem with the taste. Because it tasted great!). I made a few slight alterations: I made it with 3 onions instead of 1, and I sliced them into half-rings before getting them good and browned, and I added 1 TBS cumin and 1&1/2 tsp garam masala to the lentils. Everything else I left the same. The house smelled wonderful while cooking and the leftovers were great the next day - even my toddler enjoyed it. Don't skip the yogurt, since the yogurt's tang definitely pulls the flavors together. I'll definitely make this again.",

I used 3 med. sized Vadalia onions which was good but I think next time an additional one to two onions would be worth a try.   I used brown rice and cooked with the lentils with no problems.  Cooking time was approx. 45 mins.  The amount of liquid I used was approx. 3-1/2 c.   I used chicken stock for a bit more flavor.   I added 1/2 tsp cumin to the lentil/rice mixture during cooking also added the pinch of cinnamon to the onions as suggested in another review---very good.",

I ended up adding more water, and the consistency was that of risotto.  \n\nThe second time around, I used 3 cups of water + 2 chicken bouillons to cook the lentils, then I added the rice and added 2 more cups of water.  It turned out perfect and consistency was great.  \n\nAlso, to caramelize onions, it takes MORE than 10 minutes to ensure you are not just cooking them, but caramelizing them.  I cut the onions in rings and start cooking them as soon as I boil the lentils.  You have to make sure the fire is very very very low.  Your onions will caramelize beautifully and will have that perfect sweet taste.  It takes about 30 minutes.",

I did not try to follow the recipe, which sounds on spot, but was interested in the reviews and only wanted to point out that this is a traditional vegetarian dish that is used in much of the Arab world but is a particular staple during fasting periods among Arab Christians when no animal products are consumed (like the chicken broth that some people added). Even Muslims and Jews of the region eat this only as a vegan dish. The yoghurt (laban) on the side is a regional preference (mine too) and is often substituted by some sort of lemony salad or picked vegetables,like turnips. This is an ancient and revered dishl for its simplicity and humbleness, and I just wanted to add some authenticity to the pot. I am delighted that so many people tried it and responded favorably!",

For the leftovers, you can store Mujadarah in the frig for a long time but it will get dry. So, add couple table spoons of water to the dry rice, toss well, microwave on 80% power until it is steaming again. Mujadarah also best eaten with big Greek Olives and a head of raw onions on the side. You breath will smell for a while but the taste is heaven.",

For some who are not so used to cooking or eating with rice, the recipe should indicate it clearly.  Yes, I agree with other viewers, you need to add cumin and cinnamon which in the original Egyptian mujadarrah dish calls for, the amount depending on your taste and liking, because some doesn't like the smell of the cumin.  Adding these spices would make a big difference.  And of course, yogurt and greek salad really goes well with this dish.
