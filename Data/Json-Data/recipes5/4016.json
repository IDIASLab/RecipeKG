Because of some of the other reviewers, I omitted the lemon pepper and mixed the goat cheese with lemon juice and kosher salt and cracked black pepper. I added just a bit of balsamic vinaigrette in the bottom of the pan for a little extra flavor and it was awesome. Although, I think it would have been fabulous without it as well. Some of the other reviewers didn't make the cream cheese sauce, but, it really is a must. Thanks for this recipe! Coming from Alaska, where Halibut if abundant, we are always looking for great new Halibut recipes and this is a keeper! ",
