I have been cooking for 40 years and have made virtually every sort of dish imaginable so I am not a novice in the kitchen.

Alternating layers of crumb and wet adding the baking powder 3 minutes and whisking in to the wet ingredients before pouring into the pie shell resulted in a nice cake layer with a scant 1/8\" of goo and a nice 1/8\" of dry crumb on top. I used 1tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp all of the other spices but that's my personal preference. Baking time and temp was good.",
