I'm of Indian descent and this is pretty much how we make meat as a side dish to eat with rice. Here are some tips though: 1) Cube your beef really small (like 1/2 inch pieces) so that you'll get more flavor onto your meat. 2) Instead of lemon juice use 1 tomato chopped up to add a little acidity. Be sure to cook it down all the way. 3) You can use about 1-2 tsp of red chili powder as per your taste (ie. cayenne powder NOT chili powder for chili) instead of the green chili peppers or use a smaller amount of both. They have different flavors but both provide heat. 4) Don't fry your onions until crisp...just sautee until slightly brown if you want the flavors & masala to penetrate the meat. 5) You can pre-cook your meat with ginger onions salt a little turmeric and green chilis in a pressure cooker to make the beef more tender.",

I was stingy and bought a lower grade of beef which I won't do next time but despite the fact that it wasn't as tender as I'd like (I also cut it a bit too small) the flavor was FABULOUS. I recommend not letting all of the broth cook off but instead adding the remaining broth to the coconut oil mixture. If you serve it over rice the rice soaks the sauce right up and it is so delicious! My husband and I like spicy food and will probably also add another chili or two next time. We'll definitely be making this again... and again!",
