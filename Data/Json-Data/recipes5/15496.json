Any kind of ground meat will work (I usually use ground turkey or chicken), I make my own taco seasoning/ranch dressing and I like to use organic black beans in place of the kidney beans. Sometimes, I'll mix a half cup of homemade salsa  into the ranch dressing. Any kind of chips will do--we alternate between Doritoes, Fritos and chili-lime tortilla chips. Because I eat low carb, I skip the chips on mine and double up on the lettuce. This is also a great way to use up leftover taco meat from the night before for a quick lunch. You can layer them so everything is ready to go in the container--just make sure that you seperate your dressing or make it so the dressing is on the bottom and not touching your lettuce otherwise it will wilt quickly.",
