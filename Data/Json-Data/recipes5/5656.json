Be sure to wear gloves while preparing the jalapeno; the oil will stay on your skin for a long time and will burn your eyes if you wear contacts. (I found out the hard way!) The hummus can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated. Return to room temperature before serving with crackers or pita bread.",

It did seem very dry so I added a little more lemon juice and drizzled in a little olive oil. If you are a fan of traditional hummus - you may not like this one because the cilantro flavor hides the sesame taste you get from the tahini in a traditional hummus recipe.",
