I used a 9 inch deep dish shell, and I still did not use all of the filling and crumbs.  If you do, it WILL spill over, and believe me, it's a mess.  I also think to get the right consistency, you need to alternate layering the crumbs with the filling, with crumbs on the bottom and the top.  Bake time was just right, even with the deep dish crust.  I let it cool 30 min. before digging in.  This pie is best served warm, but don't microwave it to reheat it.  Thanks for a recipe that I will make when I want some true comfort food!",

And, this is almost a perfect recipe too.  Those trying it for the first time.. you can vary the ingredients some.  The liquid part. So it doesn't overflow.  Use 3/4 cup molassas and 3/4 cup of water. Strength/bitterness will depend on the molassas (robustness).  The pie wont' taste so bitter if you use the lighter types. If you only have the robust, try using only 1/2 cup molassas and more water, or swap with 1/4 karo.  Some only use karo, but, you won't get the traditional flavor of a true shoefly pie.  You can also just do 1/2 cup M.. and 1 cup of water.  This will make it less robust, and prevent it from spilling over.  You will also get the the wet bottom if you sprinkle a little of the dry topping in first, then liquid, then more dry, etc.  I prefer this way, as it won't be too liquid on the bottom.  I also add a couple drops of cider vinegar to the liquid mix to give it a little more umph. But, only a few drops.  Again, if you are making/following this recipe, best if you use a slightly larger pie shell, or cut back some on the liquid...  Otherwise, it may overflow.  Good luck!",

I can tell you this is exactly the way shoo fly pie should taste.  I did not alter anything, except I added a dash of nutmeg and of allspice into the crumb mixture.  I would maybe ad a little more butter to the crumbs next time.\n\nI guess I used what is considered a deep dish stoneware pie plate, because the amount was correct.  I had to be extremely careful putting the pie into the oven because it was sloshing around, but when it was baked it was firm but gooey, like it's supposed to be!\n\nThis is really a fail-proof recipe in my opinion, any beginning baker should be able to make it, especially if you don't make your own crust.  You have your layer of goo, then the crumbs you put on top sink into the goo, and stay on top as well.  The crumbs should cover the entire surface.  My pie came out perfect, with a gooey filling and a crunchy top!\nSo make sure you use a deep dish pie plate, and other than that you should have a real Pennsylvania Dutch shoo fly pie!",

I could almost picture her tending the oven, making sure us girls didn't peak.\nThank you so much for posting this simple and so totally delicious recipe. I let it rest for about 10 minutes. That's all I could wait. I just had to dig in. My son and I have eaten half the pie already. And I made a 12in. deep dish pie. This is definately one of those comfort dishes and I will treasure this one always. Thanks again for the wonderful recipe.",

I did exactly what the recipe said, you do NOT need to add the crumbs in with the liquid ingredients,or reduce the liquid at all!  just press the crumbs into the mixture when it's in the shell, and then I baked mine for the first fifteen...then before lowering the temp to 350, added the rest of the crumb on top.
