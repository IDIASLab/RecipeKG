I\u2019ve had this recipe saved for a while, and I\u2019m so glad I finally made it.  My chicken was done (checked with a meat thermometer) in less than hour.  The sauce has a very nice tang, and I definitely could see adding some saut\u00e9ed mushrooms at the end to style it up a bit for a company meal.  So nice because it really cooks pretty quickly in the slow cooker, but not too long for a weeknight, and it allows you enough time to get your side dishes prepared with no fuss with the entree.  Liked it, actually loved it, and this one will not be forgotten.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
