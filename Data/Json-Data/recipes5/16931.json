Although I will not make this again I will give this four stars because I thought it was o.k and because there was not a piece left on the platter. Everyone ate theirs therefor it was not disgusting. and it was very tender. I baked at 425 for 30 minutes (put on foil sure made a mess on my jelly roll pan) I would suggest only marinating for a few hours maybe two.",
