For this recipe, let me say straight off the bat--all Indian/Pakistani curries have garlic and ginger paste. The most common way is to throw it in the beginning when frying onions. Also, if you're old school, use fresh tomatoes (paste cuts down the time, I guess). I've never used coconut milk and tomato paste in the same recipe myself, but that's an interesting combination. For the red pepper--a pinch is not sufficient. It will be too bland, at least 1 tsp. I would add all the spices in the beginning when frying the onions, then put the chicken and THEN the tomatoes. Definitely more spices or this will be too bland (try cumin powder, coriander powder, etc). I hope this helps someone.",

If you like extra sauce though, I would suggest you use a little more than 1/2 can of lite/regular coconut milk instead. This insures that you will have enough sauce to eat over rice with. Also, I didn't have any cilantro on hand so I didn't use it. I did however, add more tumeric and cumin until it tasted strong enough because I like my Indian dishes very articulate. I served this with basmati rice and naan, so delicious!",

I didn't have chili paste, so I used 1 tbsp. sriracha sauce instead. Since sriracha already has sugar in it I omitted the brown sugar. It was pretty spicy. I often use coconut cream instead of coconut milk in recipes. About 3 tbsp + 1 c. water = 1 c. coconut milk. It's cheaper this way. I think next time I'll add potatoes. It was very flavorful and would be great with tofu!",

I also used ground cumin because I was out of cumin seeds and that was fine. I also used hot chili oil instead of chili paste and it mixed well. Because I like savory spicy food I tripled the amount of brown sugar in the mix and it turned out fantastic. Because I was looking to get some vegetables in the mix at the last few minutes of simmering I added some baby spinach leaves. They were great in the mix and didn't detract from the dish. Even my overly picky brother who \"doesn't do hot\" loved this. Serve it with basmati rice and naan and you're set.",

I didn't expect the flavors to be so intense when I read the ingredients I thought it may be a bit too sweet and I don't like \"sweet meat\" lol. As I was cooking it I thought there wasn't a lot of sauce so I doubled all the sauce ingredients but left the chicken the same. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly EXCEPT I accidentally added A LOT more turmeric because the top fell off while I was adding it! However it tasted really good so I think I will always add more than the recipe calls for say 1.5 tsp for a double sauce batch. I also added one red chile and one green chile but I left them whole. This gives flavor without a lot of heat. I did that instead of the paste along with a small sprinkle of chili powder because I didn't have any paste. Otherwise I followed it as written. It was so good! Will certainly make again and again! Don't be too critical if you're looking for gourmet indian because this isn't it. But it's a fantastically flavored dish that will please a wide variety of people.",
