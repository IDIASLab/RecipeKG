The chicken was moist....I paired it with homemade mashed potatoes & fresh broccoli. Mmmmmmmm mmmmm mmmmmm Good!!!",

I used organic bacon and I like to have things a little spicier so I cut back on the ketchup but added 1/2 a cup of Chilli sauce.  It turned out very good and did not drown out the maple syrup taste.  I also doubled the garlic.  Cooking the bacon first is a very good idea and I also seared the chicken breasts in a frying pan first.  I'll definitely be making this again.",
