We used 4 chicken breasts, as stated, and had wayyyy too much vegetable mixture. Even making it with pasta and using it as a sort of sauce, it was just too much. I feel like one can of artichoke hearts and a smaller can of tomatoes (or just one can) would have been sufficient. Either way, will make again!",

In this Covid 19 era I used what I had in the cupboard - so a can of green olives instead of black, boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts, and a can of artichoke heart bottoms instead of hearts. I would use green olives always in this recipe from now on, because they really added to the Mediterranean flavor. Likewise, next time I might add some capers, making it a little more Puntenesca-style. But as is it was an easy and exceptionally flavored dish. It took a bit longer than 20 minutes to cook the chicken through, more like 30 minutes+. Thanks for a great, easy recipe.",
