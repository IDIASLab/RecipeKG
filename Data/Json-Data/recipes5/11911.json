While I loved the consistency of the sauce and the meatballs were very moist I found that everything lacked flavour and that the sauce was very acidic. Both the meatballs and the sauce need more seasonings and salt personal preference perhaps. I followed the recipe as written and it was ready after four hours on low. Thanks for sharing.",
