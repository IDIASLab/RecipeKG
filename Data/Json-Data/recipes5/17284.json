I was nervous initially about making them after reading the varying reviews here - some saying too sweet, some saying not sweet enough, too much nutmeg, etc.  I think the trick is (and the beauty of this recipe)to mix up the potatoes with the butter then add half of the sugar, nutmeg and orange juice called for.  Then taste it.  Then add up to the second half to correct it to your taste.    The other great thing about this recipe is that I always make it the day before.  I cover it and refrigerate it in the serving dish without the marshmallows.  I reheat it on the day I need it then add the marshmallows and toast them under the broiler.\n\nDelicious! ",

It was still tasty. This is the perfect recipe for a traditional casserole. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think if you combine it with the \"Eggless Sweet Potato Casserole\" recipe, it becomes something that is the ultimate sweet potato dish. I used the technique of whipping the potatoes (genius!). I don't think it matters too much which spice scheme you use as long as there is enough spice (The eggless recipe results in sweeter sweet potatoes). I then made the pecan topping from the other recipe and added it to the top. I cooked it according to the other directions for a while ( because the pecan topping takes time to cook, then I added marshmellows like this recipe has, and it was perfect for my tastes. When I comined the two recipes, it turned out a lot like Boston Market sweet potato casserole.",

Only comment was that I made it a day in advance and then went to bake it for 10 minutes before serving with marshmallows on top. That was wrong because it was cold from the refrigerator and threw off the heating. What would have been better is to have left off marshmallows warm up first then add them for 10 more minutes. They just got a little darker and almost burnt since I had to leave it longer to heat up. But it was still delicious and some people said they liked the over-cooked version better anyway. Still 5 star receipe for sure!",
