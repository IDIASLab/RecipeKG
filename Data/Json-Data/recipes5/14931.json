(1) Using Peanuts (salted or unsalted) actually tastes better and is cheaper (but cashews work fine) (2) For the amount of chow mein noodles this recipe calls for I'd actually use 1 bag of butterscotch and 1 bag of semi-sweet chocolate. otherwise you're going to have a heck of a time covering all those noodles. (3) double boiler works best for melting the chips but a pot is fine- just watch you don't burn the chocolate - keep the heat low and if it starts to look grainy you've overdone it. (4) never use the rice noodles instead of the chow mein noodles (they hurt your mouth) (5) semi-sweet chocolate is best because milk chocolate and butterscotch winds up way too sweet.",

We use 1- 12oz. bag semi sweet choc. chips 1- 12oz. bag butterscoth chips (I think there is 2 cups in bag). Only 1- 6oz.can chinese noodles and 1- 14oz.bag of spanish peanuts. You can also add 12oz. of raisins if you like. I melt my chips on top of double boiler until melted remove from heat and then stir in all the crunchy things.(if kids are using double boiler be careful because hot water can spurt between pans and make sure you don't get any water in choc. mix). I drop by tablespoon onto wax papper to set but can speed that up by putting in refrigerator. These also freeze wonderful for several months! Great!",

The only downside is that the chocolate melts fast so if you don't serve these cold they get all over everyones fingers and fall apart a little. Also cook over LOW heat because the chocolate will taste bad if you cook it too fast and it can get stuck to the bottom of the pan. Also like a previous reviewer said stir the mixins in quickly because it thickens FAST.",
