My kids don't like lots of spice so I cut the chili powder in half (though I think it would be good with both tablespoons). I also double the noodles (no change to the liquids). That way it's more like a beefaroni. We often serve it with cheese to sprinkle over the top. It's a pretty flexible recipe. I've used other tomato-based items (such as spaghetti sauce or tomato paste) that was in my fridge in place of the juice (and just water it down if it isn't a runny kind). Or I vary the veggies (more peppers adding mushrooms that sort of thing) with what I have on hand.",
