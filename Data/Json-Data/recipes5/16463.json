It does not \"gel\" but you do want to cook it long enough to make a good, thick consistency. You can use 1 tablespoon of excellent quality ground cinnamon instead of the cinnamon stick, if you prefer.  Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.",

Although it is a personal peeve of mine when people alter the recipe and then review it, I did only have one cinnamon stick and it seemed to be perfect for my tastes.
