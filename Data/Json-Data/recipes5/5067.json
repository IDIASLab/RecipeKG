I do have to admit no one ever died from a stuffed bird when I was growing up. But she always had more stuffing than the bird could hold so she also made a casserol out of the extra. It turned out wonderful but every one ate the dressing from the bird first because it tasted so great.",

Didn't realize it was an Italian recipe. After rummaging thru several family cookbooks I found Mom's recipe. Comparing the two I was able to tweak my recipe. I don't recall Mom using parmesan cheese in hers and I know she didn't use garlic. Like some of the other families we always stuffed the bird the night before with no problems. The secret as told by my Nona was to cook the meat dressing and put it in the fridge the night before you plan to stuff the bird. Take the turkey and dressing out of the fridge salt & pepper the cavity and stuff. Mom also stuffed the neck cavity. Or you can bake it in a casserole. Thanks travelrose for a walk down memory lane. The dressing & the story behind it were a hit this Thanksgiving.",
