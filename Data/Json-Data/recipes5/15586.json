I changed the recipe just a little to fit my ingredients I had by using a quart jar of tomato juice (I can my own) 12 ounce bag of noodles instead of 16 oz. and home frozen corn (2c) instead of a can of corn. And so far we've made this three times in a month and everyone loves it. thanks again!",

Many previous reviewers said the recipe made too much food so this is a way to make it smaller while getting more of everything else on your plate. Really I wouldn't have wanted more noodles anyway.
