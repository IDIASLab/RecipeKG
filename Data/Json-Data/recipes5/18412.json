I did not have enough worcestershire (and thought 1/2 cup would have been too much anyway) so I drained the bottle I had and ended up with about 2TBS. Also I forgot the garlic. Otherwise pretty much as written. Served them with Farfalle (bowtie) pasta. The meatballs had a distinctive (and I mean that in a good way) flavor... warm without being overpoweringly spicy... with an excellent texture. Will definitely make again. Good for a potluck... and I migh not even need to provide pasta... the sauce is so good!",

I managed to half salavage it by adding a can of diced tomatoes a can of low-sodium beef broth and some V8 veggie juice. Even then the flavor was still very strong and there was no way I was going to eat it. Luckily the meatballs I was using were just fairly bland ones that I made last week. I'm sure I would have ended up throwing it all out had I made the meatballs in the original recipe. Husband ate this begrudgingly.",
