I like a very potato-y gnocchi, so I go with just enough flour to form the dough. Other people prefer a denser, more pasta-like dumpling, and use much more flour. I know many of you hate it when I say this, but you'll just have to figure it out as you go.",

The only issue I had was separating them, when it was time to add them to the boiling water.  They stick together even though each one is covered in flour.  So my addition would be to place them on individual trays , don't over lap them, it will be difficult to pull them apart.(especially if it is a large batch).",
