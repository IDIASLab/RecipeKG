Overall the salad was rather nondescript not exactly bursting with flavor though it IS pretty and colorful. I used fresh lump crab meat and since it is expensive regret that I used it in a dish that was \"just okay.\"",

The only difference I made was to add 1.5 tsp more of the chili powder and more lemon juice, about 1 T more.  You can adjust the dressing to your taste while keeping the mayo amount the same.  We loved this!  Made it twice.  Oh and on one occasion, we added a little bit of corn kernals.  Another great addition is to add some Old Bay Seasoning.  My husband preferred it this way.",
