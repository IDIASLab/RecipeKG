The outcome of the first try was ok but the flavors needed to sink in.  After reading other reviews, the second time I mixed everything together and let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours.  THAT is the key to this salad!!   It was absolutely phenomenal and all the veggies were still crunchy.  I mixed it around a couple of times too while it sat.  I did not use the sunflower seeds either time.   Very colorful salad with lots of flavor!  Will certainly make again!",
