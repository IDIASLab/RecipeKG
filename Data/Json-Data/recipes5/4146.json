We used dark corn syrup and added pepper, onions, brown sugar and extra ground ginger.  We put crushed pineapples in the sauce and pineapple slices on top the chicken. We added the brown sugar to the mixture and also sprinkled it on top of the pineapple slices. It was so good! The chicken was very moist and the flavor went throughout the entire chicken. We used drumsticks and thighs and had to bake it for an extra 15 minutes. Our sauce didn't thicken either, but it was good mixed with the peppers and onions and poured over rice. This is definitely a new favorite for us!",

After having read the other two reviews I had decided to alter it. I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic doubled the soya and ginger and corn syrup but it did not do much. I think it would be better with sweetened canned pineapple bits (I had used the unsweetened pineaplle)and half of its juice and instead of cornsyrup brown sugar making it a better possibility of it caramelizing. Good Luck to you brave ones that will try it out.",
