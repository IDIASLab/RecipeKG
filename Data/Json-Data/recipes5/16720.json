I didn't have any cardamom or whatever it was called so I left it out, they still came out wonderful. I will definitely make them again. I made these as a snack for a road trip, they are filling because of the oatmeal and healthy as well. Thanks for a great recipe!",

(I added the extra flour because my homemade applesauce was a bit thin.) The cookies turned out very tasty and were a big hit.\r\n\r\nThe cardamom really does make a difference; if you can't get it at your local supermarket, it can be ordered from online spice stores. It's really worth it.\r\n\r\nI'll probably make these again if I have kids coming over, but next time I'll chop the dried cherries and cranberries before adding them to make a more even mixture. I'll also bake the cookies at a slightly lower temperature for a longer period of time, since even with the extra flour they're still a bit soft.",

In fact after the inital taste test the rest of the recipe is headed to IRAQ in a goodie box for a great friend who's stationed there. He & his crew love oatmeal so this should definitely fit the bill; and the tartness of the dried fruit is perfect. The recipe will be on my replay list. The only change I made to the recipe was to use a whole jar of chunky applesauce rather than the smooth.",

In part because it didn't really look like cookie dough and also because I made another \"breakfast cookie\" from this site that had pretty good reviews and it was not good imo. But this one is FANTASTIC! I didn't have cranberry's so I subbed raisins. I used the dried cherries (cut them in 1/2 b/c I'm feeding them to my little guys). I used pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have any cardormom and I kept the original amt. of cinnamon even with the pumpkin pie spice. I also added a splash of vanilla extract. These are so so so good. I kid you not. I formthem into little patty's with my hands before baking them - and only bake them for 10 mins max! They'll keep baking after you take them out of the oven so don't over bake them and dry them out. I keep mine in a tupperware container or large freezer bags throw a piece of bread in the bag to keep them moist through out the week- although they don't last a whole wk in my home. EDIT: I used apple cider today instead of apple sauce as it's all I had. Took it over the top.",
