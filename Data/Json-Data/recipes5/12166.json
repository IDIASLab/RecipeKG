I had to make a couple of changes because I was out of the ingredients, but they were so similar I don't think it would change the outcome at all.  I was out of mayo and siracha sauce, so replaced them with plain Greek yogurt and hot sauce.  The air fryer did them well, they were drier on the outside, but still moist on the inside. I think I'm going to try in a pan on the stove to see if I can get them a bit crispy on the outside. Thank you!!!",
