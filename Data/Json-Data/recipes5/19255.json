It's very versatile, simply add your favorite dried fruits, nuts, toasted coconut, etc.  If you prefer your granola harder, just cook it a little longer at the end. Using butter will give it a deeper/heavier flavor, oil gives it a lighter flavor, more like the commercial granolas you find at your grocery store.",

I left out the butter and used just over 1 T. oil per cup of oats (1/2 when cooking oats half when melting sugar and honey) to keep it healthier and less like a cookie. I don't keep molasses on hand so I replaced it with extra honey - lighter flavor put still good. CAUTION: do NOT stop stirring oats! The oats seemed a little soft after cooking 3-4 minutes so T suggest cooking them an extra minute if you like a real crunchy granola versus a soft granola.",

I added 1/2 cup each oatbran wheat bran ground flax chopped walnuts chopped pecans and sliced almonds with the oats when they were toasting to add more fiber and nutrition. I used half the butter and added a little water to thin the syrup before adding the oats. I like how it makes clusters when removed from the pan after cooling. One time I used maple syrup in place of the honey and both options tasted great.",

I used regular oats (not instant as I wasn't sure if that would work). I used some coconut and some chopped walnuts also. I wasn't very thrilled about how chewy this granola was. I was expecting something crunchier. It actually hurt my jaw to have it for breakfast. However the taste was terrific and if eaten as a snack was great. I'm going to try my hand at some other granola recipes on this site but I will most likely make this one again as like I said the taste was terrific.",

My guys like it with milk and warm fresh from my pan lol once it cools and whatever is left I put in a tupperware canister and put it in the frig. I dont know how long it will last cause its go real fast in my house. I love mine with fresh peaches and some cream. or yogurt and dried fruit in the winter.",
