I doubled the sauce when I made it, laid out the ingredients into 3 bread size pans, and froze two of them.

Next time I'll probably add in some mushrooms, spinach and maybe layer in summer squash as well.",

I\u2019m new to vegetarian cooking. Frankly, I\u2019m not much of a cook at all. There\u2019s a 70/30 chance I will screw something up. BUT I NAILED THIS! Best lasagna ever. My carnivorous husband and son. Ate it up. My husband had no idea it was not meat. I asked for his feedback and he said, \u201cit\u2019s the best lasagna you ever made. Only thing I\u2019d say is add more meat \u201c lol that\u2019s when I blew his mind and said it was vegetarian.  Now that\u2019s a recipe we noob vegetarians need! I did cheat on one thing\u2026. I popped open a jar of Foddy marinara because I wanted to top the noodles and keep them from drying out. The recipe sauce mixture was very thick. I think the ratios of layer components were spot on. I\u2019m going to make this as an addition to thanksgiving next week!",

Instead of 2 layers of 6 lasagna noodles I really think it should be 3 layers of 4 noodles.  Most lasagna recipes have at least 3  noodle layers.  And 6 noodles per layer is a bit much for a 9 X 13 baking dish.  So the 2nd time i made it with 3 layers of 4 noodles and it was perfect! I wonder if anyone else noticed this?",
