If baked as per recipe, the quiche will be too oily and will not fit into one deep pie dish.  Instead, I suggest making 2 quiches!  Keep the same amount of spinach/mushroom/cheese mixture and separate it into 2 portions.  Use the 4 eggs and 1 cup of milk (can decrease to 3/4 if you like) and half of the spinach/mushroom/cheese mixture for one quiche, and the same for the other quiche.  Only use 1 tbsp of butter instead of the 1/2 cup recommended as it is WAY too much butter if you stick to the recipe.\r\nThe quiches turned out delicious and had a beautiful colour to them! Since this was my first quiche, I was afraid it would be too watery, but it came out firm.  Tastes great!",

I told my husband I'd make one, so I found this recipe.  This is not only the BEST quiche I have ever had; I'd venture to say it is one of the most delicious foods I've ever eaten.  Next time, I will try to make it with less butter as others have suggested.  I used plain feta and added a dash of oregano, basil, rosemary and seasoned pepper.  I made the Pastry for a Single Crust Pie from this site, and it was great for this dish.  (Probably not so great for a sweet pie).  Anyway, thank you for the fantastic recipe Bailey, you are single-handedly responsible for finding a way to get my six year old to not only EAT spinach, but to eat it with gusto!  I am in your debt.  :)\n\nEdited to add:  If you ever plan on making this \"healthier\" by cutting back on the butter, I highly recommend you do it the FIRST time, so you won't be disappointed in the difference.  It's still a good quiche with 1.5 Tbsp of butter, but it's a GREAT quiche with the whole stick.  LOL",

Other fun things to try next time include bacon bits, a handful of almonds or pecans, raisins, or topping it with bread crumbs, croutons or fried onions!

                "reviewBody": "WOW.  This was so excellent.  I made it for my Bridesmaid's Luncheon and everyone loved it.  I should, however, have read the reviews first and not used as much butter-- maybe only 1/2 or 2/3 as much.  I would call this less of a quiche and more like the Greek dish Spanikopita (spinach pie).  I left the mushrooms out and just used the spinach and the cheese.  The extra butter made the pie crust nice and flaky (in some spots-- in others is was just soggy and greasy) like the phillo dough used in Spanikopita.  I used Sundried Tomato and Basil Feta (all I could find) and it was delicious.  The cheddar cheese and egg on top were a very pleasant contrast to the spinach and feta mixture on the bottom.  A past reviewer said her egg mixture overflowed in the oven, even though she used a deep dish pie crust.  Maybe that was because you used eggs that were too large?  I don't think I'd use anything bigger than a large egg for this recipe.  Also, I think a cup of milk is too much to add to the eggs.  I only used between 1/2 and 3/4 of a cup.  This turned out way better than I expected.  It's also one of those great dishes you can get creative with depending on your mood.  Just change the ingredients to whatever you have on hand or feel like using!  A++",
