Used the taco seasoning mix from this site. Used Mexicorn - no green chilis. Did not have roasted red peppers. Wow was this good. When I can get back to the store, I will make it properly, but this was VERY easy and so so good. A nice change from tomato, lettuce and onions. and so pretty. Thanks for a great recipe that is easy to modify during these miserable times and make a different meal (with beans)!!",

This is a really good salad and with some grilled chicken added it would make for a perfect summertime meal. Thanks for sharing!",
