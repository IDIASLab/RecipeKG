I looked at the other reviews and decided to try some of the saved sauce on the bottom of my pan for baking and that worked well. When it came time for the cheese I only used half (I didn't want it to slide off!) let it finish baking and then added the rest of the cheese when it was done---putting it back in the oven only long enough to let it melt. Excellent! We have enough left for a really good sandwich! YUM! Thank you so very much Paula!",

I like using both beef & Italian sausage (we make our own from this website).  Also will top at the end mozzarella cheese.  I prefer using crushed crackers to Italian bread crumbs (texture doesn't seem mushy of meatloaf then).  We will also put the Classico Four Cheese Sauce over the meatloaf when service, but not in the making.  I use an egg & diced onion, but that is it.  All the grease from baking this recipe will ruin all the sauce you pour over for baking.  Your sauce is ruined.",
