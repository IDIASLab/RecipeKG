Plus I had some real Ginger and Garlic in the pantry which seemed perfect. Diced everything up and sauteed it for awhile to meld flavors and soften/caramelize fruit and veggies. I encourage adding extra onion. It worked very very well. I used my own Poultry Seasoning (w/o salt). Ground mixed peppercorns and Kosher salt finished the chicken thigh seasoning. For those who don't like raw ingredients...this solves it. Kids might even eat it. Without any green onion tops I used dried chives for garnish (I'll pass on cilantro). This is a really good looking and flexible recipe...substitute some ingredients and seasonings. Only thing that really needs to be cooked is the chicken.",
