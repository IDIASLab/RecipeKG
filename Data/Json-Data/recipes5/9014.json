Then for the Pesto I used a recipe from this site (Pesto..by Valerie) and it in itself was a 5 - simply amazing. To the Ricotta I added 1t minced garlic and blended with Asiago (I substituted freshly shredded Asiago for Parmesan because it's what I had on hand - I don't see anywhere in the directions where it says to use the Romano so I used all Asiago). I spooned 3T spaghetti sauce from a jar onto the Pesto (we love sauce) before laying down the Ricotta blend. I topped with Roma tomatoes 1 cup diced cooked chicken 1/2 can drained artichoke hearts 2oz sliced fresh mushrooms 1/2 of a diced red pepper 1/2 of a diced green pepper small can of sliced black olives and more shredded Asiago to taste on top. Baked on pizza stone. Reduced cooking temp to 375 and increased cooking time to 30 mins to enable heating of so much topping. We couldn't get over how fabulous this pizza tasted - like something from a restaurant! The crust was perfect and the Pesto made the recipe! Thanks for such an inspiring base pizza - we will use this over & over!",

I used the refrigerated pizza crust in a can (which is one thing I would do differently next time; the crust was not as thick as I would have preferred) and I used only one sliced tomato. I also added some chopped mushrooms and lightly sprinkled some onion and garlic powder on the top. I added just a touch of shredded mozz & sharp cheddar. I have to say... this pizza is not for everyone. I think that if I tried to serve this to most of the people I know (who LOVE their meats and cheeses) well they'd probably only eat a square or two. Myself - I prefer my pizza sauce but this was a VERY nice change for a very delicious pizza!",
