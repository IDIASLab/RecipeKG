I made the following minor substitutions: (1)sesame oil for olive oil; (2) lime juice for the lemon; (3) Sambal Oelek chili paste instead of chili garlic sauce and then added an extra clove of diced garlic.  I broiled the salmon for about 8 1/2 minutes and it came out great.  I will definitely be making this again.  My husband thought it was a little strong on the hoisin so I may reduce that slightly next time, but otherwise it was near perfect!",
