I made sure not to tell my boyfriend what i was making because I knew he wouldnt go for it a couple bites in and he was ready to know when i would make it again:) We love garlic and onions so i cooked up some onion with the turkey then added in minced garlic. I also used someone elses idea to add bread crumbs in with the meat. Will definitely make this dish again!!! The sweet and spicy combination is perfect.",
