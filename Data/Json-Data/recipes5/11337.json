Honey powder is dehydrated honey, and while honey may be used I prefer honey powder as it is not sticky. Both may be found at the Savory spice shop, or your local grocer may carry them",

I did not have honey powder or tomato powder so I subbed honey and tomato paste, and did a little more coconut milk than called for but otherwise followed the instructions as written. It was delicious! For our taste, next time I will add more salt and maybe try a Vindaloo curry powder, but as it was, was still very good. I do think the cooking times may need adjustment as the meat was so tender it shredded, but it didn\u2019t affect the dish in my opinion.",
