Definitely increase the bacon to 1 pound or more I used 1 pound and it didn't seem like quite enough bacon flavor. Also next time I'd double the onions and saute green/red peppers as well. It needs more flavor. Following others I increased to 14 eggs and I used 2-1/4 cup milk. I cubed the bagels it was too difficult to slice thin and used \"The Works\" (everything) bagels. I also doubled the cheese but I think it would have been good to put one cup between layers and a 1/2 to 1 cup on top. The parsley didn't do much for the dish but some added spices would be great. Needed a little more pepper and I'd add a small amount of salt if your diet allows or let everybody do their own at the table. All in all this was easy and very good it just needed some modifications and more seasoning. I think we'll try it with diced ham next time. It is a keeper.",

I then sprayed some butter spray on the bagel-bites and I then lightly toasted them in the oven under the broiler.  I thought it seemed like them may end of soggy.  I also doubled up on the bacon after making it with the called for amount and it looked like not enough. I put a little extra cheddar after the final layer and it looked beautiful. This recipe had everyone calling for the recipe!!  I can't wait to make it again and add some tomatoes, bell peppers and whatever other vege's are in the fridge.",

One problem I noted was the toughness of the top layer of bagel slices. It's a nice idea but they came out very hard and tough requiring a knife to eat. You need to either leave off the top bagel layer or make a larger amount of the egg filling so the top bagels are completely covered.",

I add 1 cup shredded cheese, salt, pepper, 1 tsp mustard powder, and 1 tsp onion powder(because I don't feel like chopping and cooking an onion) to the egg mix.  Then I tear the bagels up into pieces and let them sit in the egg mix for about 1/2 hour while I'm cooking the bacon with the \"Bacon for a family or crowd\" recipe.  I use scissors to cut the bacon into pieces and mix it into the egg mix.  I spray a 9x13 with cooking oil spray and pour the whole bowl in.  I top it with some parm cheese and another cup of shredded cheddar.  I top it with aluminum foil and cook for 30 minutes, then I take the foil off and cook it another 20 minutes.  It turns out puffy and beautiful.  This is my favorite breakfast casserole, and I've tried MANY.",

The only things I did differently were I ended up using a smaller pan (which meant thicker layers so I had to cook it a little longer 45min.) and I covered the casserole during the first 15/20 minutes. Then I uncovered it for the remaining baking time. The top layer didn't get burned or wasn't tough and everything cooked through nicely. Lastly I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon.
