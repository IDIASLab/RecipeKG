And I usually lean towards something \"mexican\" since it is my favorite. I made a few alterations to this recipe but my results were fabulous. These are VERY cheesy so I may reduce the amount to 3/4 of a package next time. I didn't have any canned chicken so I cut up 10 chicken tenderloins and sauteed them in oil. I replaced the evaporated milk with a 10oz can of enchilada sauce and didn't add the cumin since I was out. I had originally intended to use the mexican style velvetta cheese if I could have found it but I ended up using the regular. I only added 1/2 a cup of sour cream and had plenty of sauce to pour over the enchiladas. Keep in mind...these do not have a \"spicy\" flavor. The green chilies only add a small amount of flavor if any at all so be sure to add your spices accordingly. You could also melt all of the ingredients together in a crock pot and use this as a dip. That's exactly what I did with the small amount of chicken and sauce mixture I had left over. Terrific!! Thanks for sharing Heather.",
