It did take longer than 30 minutes for mine to reduce but maybe I wasn't cooking it at a high enough temp for fear of scalding the cream. We had a bunch leftover so I greased my muffin pan and poured in the remaining sauce then froze. I wrapped each one in saran wrap and stored in the freeze. Now we can pull out individual servings when ever we want. We also served it over crab cakes. Delicious!",

I'm so glad that I tried this one! I forgot red bell peppers when I went to the grocery store but had a jar of roasted red peppers so I used that instead (it had 2 peppers in it). I also wanted to make this a bit lower in calories so I used half skim milk the rest half and half in place of the cream. Used hot paprika too. This one is going in the fav's folder, thanks so much for the recipe:)\r\nEdit 10/20/11, I recently made this recipe again using fresh red bell peppers, I must say that I really enjoyed this sauce more the last time that I made it using the roasted red peppers, they really enhance the flavor. This sauce is amazing either way though.",
