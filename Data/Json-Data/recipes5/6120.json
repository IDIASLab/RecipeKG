I usually make this on bread for a sandwich but if I'm really feeling fancy I make this on toast (lol). I make this without the onions and celery because I'm not a fan of celery and I prefer the sweeter taste of this without the onions. I also cut back a little on the lemon juice and it turns out just to my liking every time. Thanks for sharing this! It's delicious!",

It was too saucy, and I ran out of chicken.  So my recommendation until I try this again and edit this review is to add the sauce to the chicken until you have it right.  I love all these ingredients, and I really love avocado.  It could be that there is just too much mayo!  I will work on this until I get it right.  I'm sure the submitter of this recipe is just cringing right now reading this.  But Runs with Scissors, I did like this and will make it again!  I promise!",
