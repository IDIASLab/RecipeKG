I opted to use fresh broccoli because it was in season and I happened to have boatloads of it, but I did not cook it as long as the instructions said as I wanted my broccoli to be al dente (that's just how I prefer it) and I knew that if I cooked it for a lengthy time it would go gray on me and no thanks to that.  As mentioned by other users, this recipe is great as a base recipe and stands up to being customized.  I have made it a couple of times now, and even topped some leftovers with a fried egg & Tabasco sauce, very very good.  I am guessing that if you made a big batch of this you could top it off with some sour cream and cheddar for a casserole treatment.  Like I said... good base to work from so 4 stars.",

I made the rice separately and used spinach in stead of the broccoli. Unfortunately after cooking the chicken (which never browned at all) I added the ingredients as specified even adding some extra garlic and onion powder but the flavor just never amounted to much. You could just barely sense a lemon flavor. The recipe is easy to make but bland. I may try it again working to improve the flavor with spices, real garlic and shredded Parmesan cheese.",
