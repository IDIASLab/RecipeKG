It sounded like it would work well together but the garlic was waaayyy too strong - and I'm a garlic lover. And the worcestershire in the sugar/butter/nut mixture threw the whole thing off in my opinion. I'm keeping this cheese ball though as I think I can use it to make a sort of sauce for chicken or pork...can't see wasting it. I may try making it again - but reduce the amount of garlic powder drastically and omit the worcestershire all together.",
