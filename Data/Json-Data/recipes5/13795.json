The recipe submitter noted you could omit the ham for a vegetarian version but I think you'd need to add more seasoning or perhaps even broth if you did that to prevent them from being bland. I bought a package of beans that had a ham flavored seasoning packet and that worked good. I did not end up blending mine because I prefer a thinner soup. They were soft enough you could just mash them with the back of a spoon until you got the desired consistency. Overall good recipe but I think it could use some tweaks to boost the flavor.",
