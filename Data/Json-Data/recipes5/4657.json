One of them posted a request asking other members to each suggest one ingredient and challenged me to make a dish out of only those ingredients, plus salt and pepper.  After 15 minutes, she gave me the list.  People had so much fun participating and I had a blast creating the dish.  It turned out so good that my kids licked their plates!  Everyone who participated deserves credit for creating the dish, so I have given their display names next to their ingredient.  The recipe you see here is the result of that incredibly fun challenge.",

Keri I'm impressed. You were certainly up to the challenge on this one. To be given a prescribed predetermined set of ingredients as was the case here and come up with a dish - let alone one as good as this - takes a seasoned and creative cook so kudos to you! I changed the cooking method a little for my own comfort level and didn't measure anything precisely. But aside from using heavy cream rather than half and half and a mix of butter and olive oil I did not deviate from your creation. Hubs took my mom out for dinner tonight at a very nice restaurant in Milwaukee (I'm in Naples) and I can only hope their dinner was even half as good as mine. This is just a simply beautiful dish all the way around in presentation as well as taste. No need to deviate from your recipe at all. It's perfect.",

I followed the recipe except used sliced mushrooms (instead of diced) a mixture of Roma and Grape Tomatoes (to use up what I had on hand) and a little more half & half and Parm (to stretch the sauce to serve 6). The sauce is absolutely incredible. I usually cut the wine back a little in recipes but used the amount called for and it was perfect. I love the fresh bright flavor the lemon juice gives this. My daughter's friend was here when we served this. She insisted on taking the recipe home with her when she left. Compliments all around. We will enjoy this often. Thanks so much for sharing!!",
