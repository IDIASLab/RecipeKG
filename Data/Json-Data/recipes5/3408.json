This is the first time I have seen shrimp in a tabbouleh salad and I found it a fresh addition. It provided another layer of texture as shrimp as a \"to the bite\" feel to it. While parsley plays a big role in this salad I am not a huge fan of it and as such that element was not my favourite part. Overall I did enjoy this recipe but I did note that its a salad that needs to be consumed within a day or two as the bulgar tends to take on a goopy consistency when it marinates with the other ingredients for too long.",

The second time I had so quintuple the recipe for a shower and it worked out quite nicely - ridiculous amount of chopping though. Neither times have I used shrimp and neither times has it been missed. I found it really important to make sure that the bulgur has absorbed all the water and has become dry and fluffy before you add it to the tabbolueh - otherwise you get this gross water at the bottom of the bowl. I think it's better to just cook the tabbouleh on the stove instead of pouring hot water over it as the recipe said. Also I prefer using 1 cup bulgur to 1.25 cups water. Feta and tomatoes are a natural addition. I served it with hummus and pita and it was a huge hit. The portions given here are verrrry generous. Make it as it says and you'll be eating it for a week.

I also used smaller shrimp as suggested and tossed them through. It is best cold IMHO but delicious no matter when you eat it!

However that isn't what made it boring because I never put the cucumber in anyway. And the shrimp was more \"on the side\" and not really an integral part of the tabbouleh itself and is also not a typical ingredient so that wasn't it. I have to imagine that either the coriander and ginger did something to it (though I didn't directly taste those) or perhaps I missed the tomatoes. Too little olive oil. I don't know. I don't love tabbouleh but I like it and this just wasn't it. Also it doesn't need cooked on the stove - it needs a proper amount of water and a proper soaking time. Max water should've been 2 cups. No way is that soaking up that kind of water in 15-20 minutes! Most recipes say 30 and sometimes it can take as long as 45 minutes. At 45 minutes it was still wet and gross on the bottom so I left it longer and still ended up trying to drain a bit off. I tried adding some lime juice then more lemon juice (which I had to offset with some sugar) more pepper. Finally I just added some balsamic vinegar to try to give it some kick and that helped. Then for the heck of it I added some tuna and greatly salted individual servings and then it was finally - decent. I try to save 1's for inedible and this only barely got the 2.",
