                "reviewBody": "I wish I would have scaled this down to a smaller yield because I know this will not get eaten. First the description indicates the anchovy paste isn't noticeable. Trust me a tablespoon of anchovy paste in a cup of dressing is noticeable! In my opinion a teaspoon maximum would be better. Second with only green onion parsley and chives the dressing lacks the complexity and depth that the addition of other herbs would provide - adding dill and basil would really round the herb flavor out. Third between the lemon juice parsley and anchovy paste there is a hint of bitterness that a touch of honey or sugar would rectify. Finally creme fraiche is a several hour process to make and purchasing it is not only expensive but it's not always readily available. I don't think using creme fraiche necessarily makes this dressing any better than just substituting sour cream or sour cream and a little buttermilk. Overall the anchovy taste SHOULD not be noticeable and I missed the creamy herbiness a good Green Goddess Dressing should have.",

The origin of this dressing was to make a real mayonnaise homemade in the blender as that's what chefs did back in the day it was created. the tarragon was the center point plus chive or scallion garlic and anchovy with parsley. when you whirl that around in the egg until it's well blended yes that's the \"green\" part. Then emulsify oil into it. Then balance out the finished mayonnaise with creme fraiche. I didn't see garlic in this recipe or the tarragon. Thus it's not an authentic adaptation of what the original creator intended. The original version of this was meant to be served with constructed crab seafood salad much as remoulade or something similar is still used in New Orleans cuisine.",
