Also, I did opt to use the whole packet of taco seasoning b/c I didn't want to keep the little bit that was left in the packet. After shredding, I poured some of the liquid over to keep it moist. This was very flavorful. We used this to make lettuce 'tacos', and topped them w/ red onion, tomatoes, shredded cheddar and a bit of sour cream. The whole family LOVED this...definite keeper~YUM!

Thank goodness for a nice variety of garnishes to liven up the flavor, b/c the 3 TB of taco seasoning really didn't make the chicken all that flavorful. But the prep was such a snap that this recipe certainly deserves stars for ease; it just needs a flavor-bump.",

I used a homemade taco seasoning from this site as well as 1 tablespoon of ground coriander and 3 cloves of garlic to amp up the flavor a bit.
