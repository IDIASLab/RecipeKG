The touch of lemon flavor mixed with the strong taste of the balsamic vinegar are interesting and really very tasty. We will definitely make this one often but next time we need a double batch because this batch was gone in minutes!",

I sliced all the veggies to the same thickness. The balsamic and lemon work very well together.",
