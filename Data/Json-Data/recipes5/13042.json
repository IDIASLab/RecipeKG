For those not use to the nice strong lemony zest the flavor can be overpowering. But you can try using half a lemon at first until the flavor is to your taste. Also Be mindful of the volume. The recipe is enough to do a big 8 quart pot. So you may need to cut in 1/2 the measurements. Love this! Thank you for sharing this recipe.",

Made some changes based on what I had: chicken bouillon cubes omitted the chicken chunks added 1.25c egg noodles at the end. I liked it a lot. I forgot to cut the rice in half (so I used 1.5c of half jasmine & half uncle bens). It came out thick kind of like a watery clam chowder (not in a bad way). The flavors are really good. The lemon is fresh and nice. Maybe add lemon zest too? Might be overpowering. Thanks for the recipe.",
