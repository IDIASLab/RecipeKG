Combined yeast, honey (in place of sugar), butter, and warm water in a separate bowl.  Mixed until dissolved and left to sit a couple minutes until creamy.  Added yeast mixture to dry ingredients.  After kneeding the dough for a while, 10-15 minutes or so, I left it to rise until it was just over double the size.  Punched it down.  Put dough into bread pan and left to rise again.  Baked in the oven for 35 minutes at 350 degrees.  Yum! The crust of this bread is amazing.  I will definitely be making this bread again and again.",

I kept it exactly the same except a couple things. I put in 2 cups all purpose and one cup whole wheat (to try to get myself to eat some wheat, I like wheat, but I was raised on white, so it's hard) and I also let it rise once (regular \"basic\" bread cycle) turned the machine off and then restarted the whole cycle again (I got that tip off one site, supposed to make the bread hold up better, keep it's shape, while still being fluffy). \n\nI was scared there would be no need for bread flour or gluten but the oatmeal does the trick! It disappears into the bread and binds great! Great for kids who have issues with \"things\" showing in the bread, it's all hiding!\n\nI can't thank you enough for this one! It's my favorite! I'm so glad it had oatmeal in it too! Great great great!",

When making this by hand, the dough is quite sticky and wet so I added an extra 1/4 cup flour before turning it onto a board to knead. I then added about another 1/4 cup throughout the kneading process - about 5 min. total.  I let it rise 1 1/2 hours for the 1st rise, punch down, put into a large loaf pan and let rise another 45 min.  I baked it for exactly 35 min. at 350 and had to cover the top with foil for the last 15 min. It's a super moist bread, dense but tender with a slight oat taste.  **Update** This bread does stale quickly after about two days and crumbles. To keep it moist longer and have a chewier texture, add 2-3 tablespoons of powdered gluten. The rise will also be higher.  Try it!",

I've made it twice already, and will make it again as soon as the bread machine cools off.  I did change a few things though.  I only used 3/4 tsp of salt, 2 T olive oil instead of butter, and 3 T of brown sugar instead of 2.  It looks perfect, tastes perfect, and my 7 kids and I ALL loved it and that is really something hard to find.  My husband didn't get to try it because we ate it all before he got home!  It rose to the top of my 2 lb breadman machine without over filling.  I will probably try adding some raisins and cinnamon next time for something different, but this really is awesome just the way it is.  Thanks!",

Of all the bread machine recipes I've tried this is probably my least favorite. The dough rose too high which resulted in a bread that was too moist fluffy and soft for my liking. (Once out of the bread machine I did throw it in the oven for an additional ten minutes at 375 degrees) It just didn't have the substance or the texture I like in bread though I admit I grew up with homemade Italian bread! I also thought the taste was rather flat. In hindsight I'd increase the salt and decrease the yeast and sugar. Also I assumed I'd notice the oatmeal in the bread but I did not. Either I just had a bad bread baking day or it's just a matter of personal preference or maybe this is one of those breads that's best baked in the oven.",
