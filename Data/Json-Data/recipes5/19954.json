The only thing I would have done different is make more of the pineapple mix because we had more than 3 people and I didn't realize that these measurements are for 3 servings. Otherwise absolutely delicious!",

The dressing packets that came with my salad mix were on the verge of being thrown away minus the little bit used to make this instead I made the small amount called for first - poured all of it into a bag with the chicken ahead of time and let it marinate. Then I used the rest of the dressing packets and multiplied the rest of the ingredients to make as much more as I could...I jarred it up and refrigerated. Now we have more dressing for next time (or marinade because the chicken was AMAZING!) and I didn't waste any. Everyone made their salads with the stuff they liked and left off what they didn't so everyone got to enjoy this meal! But we all agreed on one thing - we want the chicken again!",
