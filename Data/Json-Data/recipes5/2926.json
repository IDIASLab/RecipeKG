I added garlic like 6 cloves chopped instead of thyme I used approx 2 TBS fresh-chopped rosemary (I have it growing in my garden) some fresh oregano and I did use the olive oil lemon juice and salt/pepper to taste but I doubled the amounts to marinade the lamb chops. I marinated the chops overnight about 24-30 hours. We grilled it in the next evening. Served with potatoes grilled veggies and a nice red wine. Voila it was GREAT!",

I marinaded them overnight and the flavor was just perfect! Great recipe. Thanks Diane!",
