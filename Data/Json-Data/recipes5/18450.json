Brown sugar, soy sauce, and cocoa provide the base for this rather colorful dish. Goes well on a bed of fried rice. Refried beans make a good side dish. Substitute your favorite vegetables for tomatoes and Cheddar cheese for the Swiss (or Gouda if you can afford it).",

First I used Splenda with a bit of sugar free maple syrup instead of brown sugar. Instead of the bell peppers I chopped up some zucchini and added a few shakes of dried red pepper flakes. This mixture reminded me a little bit of Chicken Mole. Next time I am going to cut down on the sauce ingredients by half as this makes things really saucy! I served this over cracked bulgur wheat. I'll make this again. Thanks for the unusual but very tasty recipe. updated.. still making this recipe.. 12 years later I decided to take a picture. I did only make half the sauce and this time I used the peppers on top... I think I'd prefer them cooked but that just my preference. The chicken also tasted very good cold",
