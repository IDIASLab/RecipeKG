I came up with my recipe because I wanted to make sausage balls and did not have Bisquick (Bisquick has shortening in it and I used cream cheese as a replacement) and discovered by accident that the addition of cream cheese makes the best sausage balls. For this recipe, I did use gluten-free Bisquick and cheddar-jack cheese. As expected these were delicious.",

Even the leftovers (we make a ton of them) are no longer dried out.  The cream cheese does not take away from the flavor of the cheddar or sausage.  It only enhances.   I made these ahead of time,  freezing prior to baking, by placing them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and sliding the tray into my freezer until they are firm and ready to be popped into a freezer-safe container.  I bake them at the same temp but do increase the baking time a bit.  I just keep watch over them after the specified baking time.",
