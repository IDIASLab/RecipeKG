At that point, the asparagus was nicely done, but the bacon wasn't. So, I put the bacon back in and roasted it for another 15 minutes until it was crisp. At that point, I then poured the bacon drippings into a saute pan and I made the  roux. Once it was thickened enough, I topped my toasted bread slices with the roasted asparagus, followed by the roux,  my now crumbled bacon,  and just a few shreds of cheese.  It was absolutely delicious! I will do it again but next time I will roast the asparagus separately from the bacon because of those pesky differences in cooking times. Haha.",
