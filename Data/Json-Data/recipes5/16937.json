I did it moist and delicious! I omitted the ketchup but WOWOW the brown sugar was definitely a huge plus it even made the onions sweet and tangy and good and my kids never eat the onions but they did tonight!!!

They do not look very appetizing; perhaps under the broiler for browning for a couple of minutes would help.  I can't tell that the ketchup added anything to the chops.  Next time I will salt the chops too.  I couldn't believe the taste.  The chops were enhanced with the onion & brown sugar.  These are excellent, and nothing could be easier.  I will most definately make these again & again.",

FYI don't try to cook this in less time than it says b/c the pork chips will be too tough. They are much more tender when you cook them the full hour.

I tried it in the oven though it didn't get brown like I was use to the flavor was still there and probably so much healthier than frying. The only difference in my recipe is that I mix the 1/4 Cup Ketchup and 1/4 cup water (more if you want more sauce). If usually brown the chops first then put the lemon and onion slice 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and pour the sauce over it. Cover and cook for one hour. I like your recipe though so much easier and healthier.",
