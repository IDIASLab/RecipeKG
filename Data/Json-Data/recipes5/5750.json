I used plain Greek yogurt so there was no need to drain as written in step #1 making this even easier. Only thing that I would change in the future is cutting back on the lemon juice. For us it was just a little too much lemon flavor but it did work well on gyros (another recipe on this site) and I definitely will make again.",
