I was skeptical of the apple the first time I made it and only used 1/2 an apple, but the apple is a delicious part of the salad and I always use a whole apple now.  I'm so glad this recipe was posted.",

I prebaked the salmon with an assortment of dill, garlic & onion powder, salt, pepper, and a dash of lemon zest. It worked wonderfully although using more salmon than what the recipe calls for is fully recommended. I also always use green or granny smith apples with my chicken apple curry soup and thought they would serve better than red in this recipe which was true in my personal opinion. And just to have a lil creative fun I used the bow tie pasta for the that ridge \"fin\" like look just to go with the salmon feel. Overall not my favorite but definitely a nice twist for impressing guests while trying something very new. . .",

I doubled the salmon and the pasta and the ratio of pasta to dressing was really good. Very tasty dressing and now I have leftovers. Next time I am going to double the apples as well. Very simple to make but allow a little more time than advertised (to cook the pasta and the salmon). I will definitely make this again! Thanks!",
