After microwaving the top piece it was too warm and tore so I put both crusts together and used this as a topping. DElicious!! I will start doing this from now on as I love a thick crust and this was such a good topping. I didnt use the apples and only had a bit of walnuts but I will be using Pecans from now on! I also threw in a bit of Brown Sugar as well!!",
