I reduced the amount of ginger as i can tell using fresh ginger that amount may have been over powering for me. I've made lots of turkey burgers and from my experience i have found that you dont even need to bother with the egg (because then it becomes too wet) and then you NEED the breadcrumbs, But it defeats the purpose (to me) when i want to be eating healthier. Also Turkey is very dry so the breadcrumbs suck up more moisture then need be. Just form firmly into patties does the trick , and they hold together just fine. In addition to all the spices i added in 1 chopped red jalapeno (thai chilli pepper would be awesome too).",
