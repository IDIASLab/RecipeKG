I placed the mix in a bowl and then added 1 cup of white chocolate chips so that they would get coated with the mix. I then added in the brown sugar and mixed well. After reading about other people not being able to spread in to a pan I thought that most brownie mixes call for oil. So I added 1/3 c. canola oil then c. water in place of milk and 2 eggs. Once I had the ingredients all mixed together the consistency was more like brownie batter. My family really enjoyed these and I would make again.",
