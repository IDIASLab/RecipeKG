You want 2 cloves of garlic overall.  To adjust the texture between creamy and more solid (which is very good also) vary the amount of liquid you drain from the can.  The more liquid the creamier, but lately I've been draining all of the can except for 1/2 cup.  I now use 3 large tablespoons of Tahini instead of 2.  I also take the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon and add it gradually as the blending occurs.  Peanut Butter is no substitute for Tahini!  If you're using peanut butter, you're not eating real hummus.  Find it at an international food store",

Not to be rude or anything, but because it's misleading.  Hummus is a dish that has so many regional variations.  And to try and decide which region's is more authentic is a biblical and political debate that I won't touch.  BUT- This is pretty good.  It may be a bit salty, but for some that's the way it's supposed to be!  I say this as a woman with a Turkish mom, who was married to a Greek man (I know...) and who's been to the Middle East.  It's like trying to post a BBQ recipe and calling it \"Real BBQ\".  As is, it's good enough for those that just like hummus, but if you are looking for a particular style you may have to tinker with it.",

Adjust salt to taste.  I used only 1 Tbsp of olive oil for fat reduction, but I used extra virgin, so it still gave lots of flavour.  Tips: 1 - some canned chick peas are slightly undercooked (crunchy) and should be boiled for 20 minutes or more before using (if you like a smooth texture). 2 - tahini goes rancid easily so buy it in a jar (not bulk) and keep it in the fridge.  3 - for easier digestion, discard the liquid in the can of chickpeas, rinse them, and use water for blending.",

I use 2 15oz cans of beans, therefore I use about 4 heaping tbls of tahini, juice of 2 lemons (meyer lemons are so tasty in this); otherise I followed everything else as stated(the updated version). Sometimes I take the time to peel off the skins on the garbanzo beans...it does make a creamier texture but is really not that necessary...it tastes fantastic either which way...thanks for sharing!!UPDATE: I use one can garbonzos and one can black beans (rinsed and drained). With this I use only lime juice, otherwise all the same. AWSOME!! I never ever put olive oil on top....it's too perfect to dizzle oil on. ",

Bob's Red Mill brand of White Sesame Seeds has recipes for both the tahini (made from the sesame seeds) and hummus on the package.  Tahini is simply toasted white sesame seeds ground in a food processor with some olive oil. His recipe uses a 16 oz. bag of white sesame seeds and 3/4 cup olive oil.  Toast the seeds in a single layer on a baking sheet in a 350 oven for about 10 minutes stirring a couple of times to prevent edges from becoming too brown.  Remove from oven and let them cool for at least 20 minutes.  Then pour sesame seeds into a food processor, turn it on and drizzle the olive oil into the seeds, processing until creamy (about 1-2 minutes).  Makes about 2 cups and can be stored in the refrigerator for about a week.  Enjoy!",
