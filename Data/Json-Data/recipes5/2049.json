This is one of those recipes that's like 'why didn't I think of that'? I love the flavors of the seasonings in the egg mixture and with the cheese it was just over the top! I'm notorious for 'doctoring up' an ordinary grilled cheese sandwich but this was so different from anything I've ever done. It was like a savory stuffed french toast minus the syrup of course.;) I did add a slice of swiss along with the american cheese and next time I may even add a slice of tomato. Thanks Rae for such a different and delicious twist on the ordinary boring grilled cheese! I know I will be using this method often.:)",

It's like garlic bread meets grilled cheese meets French toast all in one. My husband loved them and he's not a grilled cheese fan.

It was a nice change to a cold sandwich or plain grilled cheese. I changed it to 2 servings and used an Italian bread. The only thing I might do next time is to see if I can cut the egg back or thin it out a little with a tad more milk. I want the Italian flavor it has without too much egg taste. I am adding this to my recipe box under lunch to have again. thanks Rae",
