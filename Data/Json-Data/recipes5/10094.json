I followed the recipe as written other than adding a teaspoon of minced garlic to the shrimp as it saut\u00e9ed, but after tasting I added a number of spices and my family ended up telling me it was the best curry sauce I've ever made!  I changed the following, making it a 5+ star recipe: I added the remainder of the can of coconut milk, upped the curry powder to a full tablespoon, added 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and 1 bay leaf.  FABULOUS after additions!!!!!",
