I have to admit however that I did things a little bit differently - I had brandy but no bourbon so I just used the brandy and it's too cold at the moment to grill outside so I baked the chicken in the sauce. It was DELICIOUS. I cut up some leftover bell peppers I needed to use up and spread them around the edges of the baking dish added chicken and topped with the barbecue sauce put some sliced onions on top and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes before topping with cheese and baking another couple minutes until the cheese was melted. It was amazing. Spicy sweet and very flavorful. Thanks Janine!",

I only thought this dish was ok but I have say that I also had to substitute some ingredients the fire on our grill was too low and I didn't use the onion or cheese on top. I didn't have enough catchup any brandy or any chipotle in adobe sauce. I subbed: Tomato paste with 1 can of water; Cooking Sherry; S Bend Sauce - a flavorful Barbados brand yellow hot sauce. It was too tomatoe-y for my taste and not sweet at all. Since my fire was too low I didn't get the caramelizing on the meat like I thought I would. I tried it again the next day with the cheese...still only ok. Sorry!",
