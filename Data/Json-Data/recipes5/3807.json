I work in the Law Enforcement field and everytime we have a get together no matter what it is, even at Christmas the Officers always want me to fix Banana Pudding. They rave about this recipe and to be honest it is better than the old fashioned real recipe on the side of the Nilla Wafer Box. I started using this recipe because the original home made one always was so rich it gave me a stomach ache. They all think this is my secret recipe. Even though I have given them the recipe they say it doesn't taste the same when they make it. I Love the attention and since this has always worked I will continue using it. The only thing I have changed is I use Banana Cream instant pudding instead of Vanilla..",

Whenever I take it somewhere I'm always asked for the recipe! I typically use more wafers than what the recipe calls for because folks like the cake-like way they turn out, and I always crush a few to sprinkle on top - it looks so nice! If you're in a hurry, substituting Cool Whip for the heavy cream works fine. It's great both ways! The BEST banana pudding EVER!",
