These were light, fluffy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside - what more could you as for on a Sunday morning. I've made waffles before just adding the egg whole vs. separating and whipping the egg whites until nice and fluffy. I must say it's worth the extra step of whipping the egg whites and folding them in - the result was a much fluffier waffle. I melted the butter and used 6 Tbsp. of white sugar vs. brown and added a generous splash of vanilla. These are delicious topped with butter, real maple syrup or fresh fruit and whipped cream! Thanks for a great recipe!",
