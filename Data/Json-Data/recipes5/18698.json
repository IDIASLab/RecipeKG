I live in Germany so apples and sausage is in no short suppy and am always looking for delicious recipes that include both of them. Anyways I made a few little changes I cooked the sausages in beer and then cut them lengthways and turned the heat up high which allows the beer to carmelize and crisps the outside of the sausages. I did the apple onion mixture as directed and served it on top of some mashed potatoes with the sausages on the very top. So so so so good!!",

I used sweet italian sausages, granny smith apples, red wine vinegar & I was out of brown sugar so I used 5 tbp. red wine vinegar, 5 tbp. sugar & 1 tbp. molasses. I broiled the sausages & then sliced them on a diagonal & added them to the apple & onion mixture for a couple of minutes to coat w/ the sauce. Very good! The flavor of the sauce w/ the sausages meshed together very well. Next time I will double the onions though because they were that good. :o)",

I liked it alot but my husband thought it was too appley. The SECOND time I made it I used brats and 3/4 of the reccommended apples. I boiled the brats in dark beer instead of water and split them in half before placing them under the broiler. My husband loved it this time and the I liked that the brats had so much more flavor than the bangers. A very good German style dish!! Thanks for submitting it!!",

What that saute sauce does to the onions and apples is really good bringing out the best in those honeycrisps! My DH is a big fan of sausages and I'm not; but we both enjoyed this meal.
