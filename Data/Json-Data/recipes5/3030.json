I also substituted 1/4 cup lemon juice for 1/4 cup of the water that the cake mix directions called for.  When the cake came out of the oven, I made the glaze with 3 parts powdered sugar to 1 part lemon juice (about 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup lemon juice total), as I saw a few other reviewers mention that the recipe made too much glaze, and t least one other mention that the glaze seemed too thin.  The 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and the 1/2 cup lemon juice I used was just about right for my taste in terms of thickness and amount (I omitted the butter).  I also used a fork to poke the holes in the cake, to make it go faster.",

My husband and I are both loving it!\n\nFor the cake, I added the lemon pudding, but instead of making the cake with oil, I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. The low fat directions on most cake mixes will tell you 1/3 cup applesauce, but those little individual servings are 1/2 cup and oh-so-easy to keep on hand and just dump in!\n\nFor the glaze, I only made 2/3 the recipe and left the butter out entirely. So I just used 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 cup lemon juice.\n\nThis cake does have a definite lemon twang, but why else would you eat lemon cake?! It's super moist and super easy to make.",
