The falafel taste (and I followed the recipe exactly as written) was terrific, but the execution was just a fail.",

To stretch the recipe to serve 8, I added extra garbanzos and spices, but still just used the 2 egg whites and kept the amount of olive oil the same. I made it a day ahead and then added water to the batter so it was easier to spread on the waffle iron, which I brushed oil onto just for the first waffle. They did not stick. We had them with homemade tsaziki and sliced cherry tomatoes. Putting them on a rack in a low oven while cooking kept them slightly crisp. I would make this again. Also, I used whole wheat flour but I don't know if that made any difference.",

The only thing I will do differently next time is to cut back on the salt (maybe by 1/2), because these came out super salty, and I even drained and rinsed the beans very well. Other than that, these had great flavor. Be careful b/c getting these off of the waffle iron can be tricky. I served these w/ a Syrian-type salad, 'Roasted Garlic Tzatziki' from this site and whole grain pita. This was great for a change...I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)",
