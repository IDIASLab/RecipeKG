I ended up turning up my oven to get more browning (I like mine crispy)...made it 400 near the end when I noticed they weren't to my liking. I made my own sauce based on what I had and it was really good. Used vanilla yogurt (but any flavour yogurt will do!) in place of the sour cream and whipped dressing instead of mayo. For seasoning I added some chili powder and cumin to my taste. I am updating quantities as I made it again yesterday and it is probably 2/3 whipped dressing to 1/3 yogurt and 1 tsp each for sprices. Again try it and adjust to your preferences:) Boyfriend asked me to remember that sauce...he loved it.",

It did take longer then 25 minutes and even though the yams looked done they were very soggy to pick up so I turned the heat on the oven up to 350 degrees to help get a crisp edge on them to pull off the pan. The dip was fine but mild in flavor so I added an additional tsp of taco seasoning and it turned out prefect. However. I tasted the yam with the dip before tweaking and I didn't really think the dip matched up with yams. Yams were good Dip was good...just didn't seem to think they went together well. But that's my opinion.",
