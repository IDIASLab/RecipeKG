There were a couple of subs only because i didn't have the ingredients, and forgot one. i didn't have any creme fraiche, so i subbed low fat sour cream and and a splash of half and half. i didn't have any sherry vineagar, i used white wine vinegar and i forgot to add the oregano, so i just added it to the marinara (which i made). So delicious! i used brown basmati rice in the recipe and added some sauteed cremini mushrooms to the rice before serving. YUM! Thanks for a great recipe Chef John!",

You can buy a bottle of it at Walmart for heavens sake. You can even substitute it if you like easily enough with well a few things. A creme freishe is easily made with whipping cream and buttermilk right at home. None of the ingredients in this recipe are too stumping. But they do make a tasty and moist meatball and a great alternative to a beef. My family enjoyed it very much. Thank for another meal in my rotation.",

I had to make it dairy free so I subbed a flavourless coconut based coffee creamer that I thickened with a 1/2 tsp of corn starch instead of the creme fraiche. There were three of us for dinner and it was rated 3 4 and 5 therefore I gave it a four.",

Family all liked it too, however next time I will cut down a smidge on the cumin & cayenne. (It was fine for my taste buds but was a tad too spicy for husband and daughter.) I made the recipe as-is except for a couple of things. I used sour cream with a bit of half-n-half because I didn't have creme fraiche, and long-grain brown rice because that's what I had on hand. As for the reviewer who complained the sauce was too boring, I used a good quality seasoned tomato/pasta sauce instead of plain tomato sauce and it turned out wonderful. And after baking the meatballs, I put them in a slow cooker to finish off instead of on the stove top (just because I had the time to do so). The meatballs were tender and the flavors were out of this world! This will definitely be made again in our house.Great recipe, thanks for posting!",
