I don't know how much a typical bunch of kale is but mine was huge so I used half of it. The only other changes were to use 15oz fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned all broth(no sodium added) instead of water and broth and reduce the pepper. I did need more liquid to finish the kale and ended up using a full quart. This made a very large 6 servings and could probably be stretched to 8 in our family. The pepper is excessive for us. At six servings that would be 1/2 tsp per bowl and I know that would not be to our liking. The kale was cooked in less than 5 minutes and the rest of the vegetables were just right at that point. I'm not sure the zucchini would have survived another 25 minutes without turning to mush. Also I don't have a blender but the immersion blender worked great on the beans.",

I followed the recipe exactly except used collard greens instead of kale (no kale at grocery store).  Changes I will make next time:  I will add the squash later on, maybe even after the kale, since it got *very* soft.  I will likely add more garlic--I *always* add more garlic.  Finally, there was a bit too much tomato taste for me, I may leave out the tomato paste next time.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!",

I think if it cooked an additional 20 minutes it would have been mush though. I added some diced ham that I had left over in the fridge and I used beef broth. I also didn't measure the salt and pepper I just did it to taste. I think this my new favorite my husband had three bowls. Thanks again.",
