I only used one serrano pepper, since I'm pretty spice sensitive, and I think that worked out perfectly. I also doubled the yougart sauce- I've learned when in doubt, double the sauce! Be sure to tin-foil your baking sheet to save on the clean up! I used non fat greek yougart - I think it not being as watery as regular helped the cooking time, as I only had mine in the oven for 40 minutes before it was done and all the sauce was thickened and clinging to the tofu chunks nicely. \r\nI took a tip from another reviewer and used 2% evaporated milk instead of half and half to cut down on the fat (1 12oz can). If you don't like your cauliflower to crunch and would really like the flavors to get into it, take your time in softening it. I kept adding water to the tomato sauce as they cooked together to give it plenty of time to soften up and soak in the flavors. Better to simmer it as much as you can BEFORE you add the cream/half and half/ect. \r\n\r\nServed with a little jasmine basmati with more cilantro for garnish. I don't think the flavor is quite enough to be able to mix in much rice, next time I'll serve with naan bread instead! Very filling!",

It was the perfect amount of heat---any more and it would have overpowered the rest of the spices.  The word that kept coming to mind when eating this was \"depth\" of flavor.  Whole family loved it.  Served over jasmine rice.  The 4 of us polished it off. Btw, I subbed skim evap. milk for the half & half and didn't feel it needed all 2 cups.  Probably only used a cup.  Will do the same again.",
