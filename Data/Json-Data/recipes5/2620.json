Somehow even with adding a full can of pineapple and its juice the overall pineapple flavor was lost. I also felt that the sauce wasn't quite sweet enough. In the future I would add more pineapple maybe some brown sugar and bit more heat to the dish as well. I sprinkled on some seasoned rice wine vinegar just before serving and that helped spruce it up a bit more as well. For the ease of this dish though I would make it again but with adjustments.",
