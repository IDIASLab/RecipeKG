This recipe has a VERY large amount of soy sauce - really salty - for those who prefer less salt I would recommend 1/8 c of soy sauce is more than enough. Because the amount of liquid described was for baking not sauteeing I added cornstarch at the end to thicken the remaining juices into a sauce. Also adding mushrooms is not a bad idea. Sounds like a lot of changes I know but I don't think the spirit of the recipe was changed. Everybody liked it.",

Also I used boneless skinless chicken thighs because it was all I had. It came out SO good. My family ate all of it up and that never happens! After we took the chicken out I added some corn starch to the left over sauce to thicken it a bit and pour over the chicken and the rice we had with it. So good! Will def. make again.",

First I cut the amount of soy sauce in half because that was all I had left and it was definitely still salty enough. Half a cup would have been waaaaay too much. Second I added turmeric instead of ginger because I didn't have ginger. I still really liked the flavor and not even sure what it would taste like with ginger. The big thing to save time was cooking it on the stove instead. First I slightly browned each side of the chicken breast in some oil in a pan that has a lid. Only a few minutes is fine. Then I added the sauce and covered and cooked on low for 25 minutes turning once half way through. Last after removing the chicken I added some cornstarch mixed in cold water to thicken the sauce. Never add cornstarch powder directly to hot sauce or it will clump together. Spoon the sauce over chicken. Still comes out tasty and moist in a quarter of the time!",
