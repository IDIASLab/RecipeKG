I don't have a grill so I cooked it in a pan with a little olive oil on medium heat making sure to cook it mainly on the non-skin side so it kept it really moist. The flavor was light and the addition of the sea salt really boosted the complexity without overpowering the taste of the salmon. I'll certainly make this one again!",
