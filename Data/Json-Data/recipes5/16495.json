They are sweet to taste, but not cloyingly so. They are very filling, and dense.   I used plain raw almonds, instead of blanched ones, and it was fine. I toasted my own wheat germ, using untoasted (aka the cheap) version. I put it on a baking sheet for 5 minutes at 350F. Perfect. ",

I had made these before I left because they sounded good and were healthy and full of protein. These ended up being the favorite part of our breakfast every morning. The taste of the orange and the consistency of the almonds and cocoanut made for a fantastic start of our day. I am 100% bringing these on every backpacking trip I go on from now on and at home for my triathlon and marathon training. They are light weight and can be individually wrapped for whatever activity you need a healthy snack on. They helped power is through the day while carrying 60 pounds up and down mountains and are good for any occasion!!!!",
