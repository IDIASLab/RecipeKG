After reading other reviews, I browned the ribs in the oven at 400 degrees for 10 minutes on each side to help reduce the fat content.  This worked great as I had no fat anywhere left in the sauce at the end. I then replaced the ketchup with bbq sauce (don't like ketchup), reduced the water to 2 tablespoons. I didn't have any celery seed so elimated that along with the sliced onions and red bell pepper.  I also rotated the ribs halfway through the cooking to make sure all were evening covered. My husband absolutely loved them (we had no leftovers!!) Thanks MITCH103 for a new and easy way to prepare bar-b-que pork ribs!!",

What is great about the sauce is that it is slightly sweet and tangy and has the perfect spice to it as well.  I use Frank's hot sauce which is tangy as well and quadruple the amount.  I also substituted teriaki sauce instead of worcesthire (as my husband hates it).  I didn't have celery seed and eliminated it.  I do think it's better the same day.  I pre-boiled my ribs to get rid of the fat and boy do you!  It also cuts down on the cook time.  I leave it on high for about 15-20 min and then turn to low for the remainder of 6 hours.  Yummy!  I did not feel that the onion and pepper overpowered the dish.  One warning!!  Make a double batch.  It's so good that you will be disappointed if you don't.  Also - You can use half the water.  Thanks for a great recipe.",

This recipe must be great because my ribs had been shoved to the back on my freezer and were horrifically freezer burnt. They came out of the slow cooker falling apart moist and tasting amazing. I skipped the peppers/onions and had to use regular mustard when I realized I was out of dijon. I boiled the ribs for 30 minutes and didn't see an ounce of fat in my sauce when these were done. I cooked the ribs on high for 1 hour and on low for 5. Perfection! This is such a great recipe; I'll be recommending it to everyone! Thank you!",

My fiance ate what was on his plate but I think he did so because he didn't care for any of the sides I served with with dinner (it was BBQ night at our house - BBQ pork Spicy Southwestern Slaw Mom's Mustard Potato Salad & garlic bread).:( It was the sauce that snubbed me. It wasn't bad but I've had better (sorry!). For one I found it to be way too sweet. Since Western-style ribs were on sale this week (.99 lb.) I chose to use them instead of boneless country ribs (but mine were bonless also...). I cut each rib in half and then boiled for 20-30 minutes as others suggested. My sauce was not greasy at all (a plus) and actually thickened somewhat! My only other change was omitting the red pepper (I didn't have one it seemed out of place and I don't like the taste/texture of cooked peppers anyways). All in all this was OK but nothing to write home about. When I want ribs I'll just grill 'em. Thanks for sharing anyways What a Dish!:-)",
