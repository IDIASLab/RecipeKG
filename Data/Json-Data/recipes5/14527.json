        "description": "As lasagnas go, this takes just about as much time as any. It is a modified version of my grandmother's recipe, so that it includes more vegetables, including eggplant. You can add whatever vegetables you want to the meat sauce. I grabbed what was seasonal and on sale, but I imagine this would be good with some spinach, broccoli, or diced tomato. Also, consider some crushed red pepper if you like a spicy sauce. Not a fan of that myself, but it would add a nice heat if that is your thing. I don't like salty sauce, so you may find you want more salt if you do prefer it that way. My oven runs hot. If necessary, please adjust your baking time to make sure the lasagna is heated all the way through.",
