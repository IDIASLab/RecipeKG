Next time, I will decrease the ingredients to half of what's called for.\nI followed the recipe to the letter . The balance of flavors were on point.  You can taste the different spices which play nicely together.\nThe CAULIPOWER pizza crust is crispy and yummy.   The choice of the pepper jack cheese was perfect and was melty with just enough of a kick to keep it interesting.\nI was so looking forward to the avocado but when I sliced it open, it was unusable   Definitely will try that again in the future.\nAll in all, this better-for-you pizza is  going into my recipe box and will be making an appearance on our table again soon.",

I didn\u2019t have onion powder so I substituted it with onion salt (which I\u2019ll probably use again the next time I make it) instead and didn\u2019t put any regular salt. It came out FANTASTIC!!! I bought a little over 2lbs of Atlantic Salmon so I doubled the ingredients. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! Ate it for dinner with broccoli as a side. I highly recommend this.",

CAULIPOWER did a great job with their line of crusts and I can't wait to try them all! I could not find the undressed crusts by me so I used a Margherita crust! I used red onions instead of white and added red peppers because I had them. Tastes like fabulous chicken fajitas on top of a crispy, tasty crust! Will be making again!
