I added more spinach because I had a pile of it and we all love it;  I served it with pilaf and a crisp fennel salad, and it was a great meal.    The only thing I think detracts from the dish is the bouillon cube.  It made the sauce taste a little fake on my palate.  I'd say skip the cube and use chicken broth instead of water.  Next time I think I'll also add a lemon juice to the cooking sauce because the flavours would be very complementary.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  Since I reviewed this recipe, I adapted it to serve at a caf\u00e9 where I served as head chef for a time, and it was an absolute HIT!  Other than the changes above, I stopped using flour altogether (I don't think a light sauce is a sin; besides which there's no runny sauce that can't be mopped up with something yummy), used cherry tomatoes instead of diced ones, and most importantly, added baby spinach leaves in the last two minutes of cooking, just so they wilt and are still bright green.",

I stuffed the mixture into a pocket I had created in the chicken breast (I did not pound it out).\n\nI browned the chicken and put it into a greased casserole dish.   I pour the broth (2 cups --I didn't use bullion and water) over the top with a little white wine (1/2 cup), some lemon juice (about 1 TBS) and garlic powder.  I baked at 350 degrees for about 1/2 hour till the juices ran clear.  Then I put the liquid from the chicken into a sauce pan and thickened with corn starch.  I added about 3 TBS of diced petite cut tomatoes, a little more oregano and one pat of butter stirred into the sauce just before serving.   I served this over couscous with a greek salad on the side.  WOW!!! \n\nThanks for the \"base recipe\".",

Personally, I don't like messing with meat mallets and toothpicks, so I simply cut pockets in the chicken breast halves and stuffed them with the feta mixture. It was delicious and a huge time saver! Next time I will increase the feta mixture because I ran out when I got to the last breast. I also had to increase the flour, salt & pepper mix (for the breading). I guess I must have been using larger chicken breasts that just took a bit more ingredients. Because several reviewers commented on the thin sauce, I used 2 tbsp flour for the sauce instead of just one. With the fully breaded chicken and the flour in the sauce, I had no problem with thickening, and it was the perfect consistency - although, I did end up simmering the dish about 30 minutes rather than 10 as suggested. My final improvise was to use an entire bag of fresh spinach (I imagine it must have been about 4 cups). It was not too much, and again, it was great in both flavor & presentation. I served over orzo, which was good, but I think I will try couscous next time. My family is already asking me to make this dish again!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a 4 star recipe as is but can definitely be enhanced by following these directions. Next time I will double the amount of feta crumbles (2 containers instead of 1). I used 5 breasts and one container only left enough flavor for a subtle hint of the feta. I squeezed half of a lemon into the cheese mixture and next time I will use the other half to squeeze on the outside of the chicken while it cooks. I used an entire bag of fresh baby spinach and will do that again next time too. In addition I am going to omit the flour next time and just season the chicken breasts with some salt pepper onion powder and garlic. The flour was pretty pointless and it didn't help to thicken the sauce up at all. I ended up adding about 2 1/2 t. of cornstarch to cold water in order to thicken the sauce. I strongly dislike runny sauces with meat and next time I will actually up this to about 1 T. of cornstarch. I also ended up filling the chicken breast in the middle and then pulling up each side of the breast on top of the filling and sticking toothpicks in that way. Folding it over was not going to work for me and I think the filling stayed it better this way. This was good but I would have preferred a slightly more lemony flavor to it and a bit of a thicker sauce. Both things are easy to rectify but for those reasons I can't give it 5 stars.",

My 8 yr. old - picky-eater son LOVED it and has begged me to make it at least once a week since! My husband who hates feta cheese even loved it. The only thing I had to change was the cooking time. It needed more like 15-20 minutes instead of 8-10. Fabulous recipe...thanks for sharing!",
