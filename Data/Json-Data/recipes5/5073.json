It is a very pretty dip and delicious. It was completely devoured at the Super Bowl party I brought it to. I got many compliments on it. I made my own pita chips to go with: 8\" pita pockets cut apart into two circles brush with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder and kosher salt cut each circle with a pizza slicer into 8 triangles arrange onto two cookie sheets and bake at 350 for 7 mins then swap the positions of the cookie sheets and cook another 7 mins or until golden brown and crispy!
