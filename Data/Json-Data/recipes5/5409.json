What a shame the previous reviewer gave it just 3 stars, stating the recipe is tedious because of the constant stirring and the adding of broth:  that is the method of risotto!  I had no problem with the rice getting soft or sticking either.  I used arborio rice as called for and stirred to prevent sticking and the texture was PERFECT.  I did not measure the amount of broth I added though, I just added until the rice was done.  Perhaps the previous reviewer had their broth at too high of a head and it boiled down, therefor lessening the amount of broth available to cook the rice?  One thing to note though:  I didn't have a lemon on hand and instead used bottled lemon juice, skipping the zest.  I highly recommend you do NOT do this and make sure you have a lemon available.  I could taste that fresh lemon juice with zest would have a brighter, cleaner flavor.  Lastly, I added salt and white pepper to taste when I added the steamed asparagus because I wanted to taste the rice once all the broth was added - since the broth has salt of its own in it.",
