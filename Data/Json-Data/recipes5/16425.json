I baked mine for 50 minutes and it turned out perfect. I really needed this cake to turn out good because I made another apple cake off of this site and it was horrid. So that was my husbands first impression of apple cake. once this was ready to eat he loved it I loved it. I have made this twice. Just make sure you let it cool long enough before turning it over or the apples will stick to the bottom of the pan. Other than the cook time this was a fabulous recipe.",

I wasn't sure how much brown sugar to use (if the 1 1/3 cup the recipe called for was 1/3 cup for the topping and 1 cup for the batter or if it all went into the batter) because the butter was not a combined measurement but the cinnamon was. I used 1/3 cup for the topping and 1 1/3 for the cake. It turned out wonderfully!",
