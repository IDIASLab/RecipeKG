The brown sugar mellows out the spices so it's not too spicy or sweet. Hubby and I are trying to alter our diet a little so I went for a rub on our lean steaks instead of a marinade with a bunch of oil. I sprayed both sides of the meat with olive oil cooking spray before putting it on the grill and served over a nice big salad. Wonderful flavor will definitely make again soon.",
