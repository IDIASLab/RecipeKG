I did skip the paperbag method and just mixed in a large stock pot and put into two aluminum lasagna pans and baked for the 10 minutes. Absolutely delicious. Soak your dishes in warm soapy water for 15 min for easy clean-up. This recipe makes a ton so you might want to half it. Once you start eating-you wont stop. The salty pretzel adds such a nice twist to this caramel popcorn treat.",

After making a first batch with clumps of caramel mixed in with plain parts with no caramel a woman at work clued me it to the critical missing step! Once you have mixed the caramel in with the popcorn pretzels and nuts put small batches in a PAM-sprayed microwave-safe bowl and put in the microwave on high for two to three minutes total stopping after each minute to stir the mixture. The caramel will completely coat the popcorn and stuff yielding that great texture similar to cracker jacks. Other than that missing tip (which I can't believe wasn't in any reviews that I saw) this recipe works great! The paper bag idea is definitely a keeper!",

I did bake it on parchment lined cookie sheets for a few minutes after pouring on the carmel. I will make it again but next time I think I will put 1/2 of the popcorn mixture on the bottom of the bag then half of the carmel half popcorn half carmel. I think it will probably mix easier that way. I will also use the suggestion of spraying the bag with pam to avoid too much stickage. No loss - I just ate the stuck stuff while backing the rest of the batch... Great Recipe!",

Put 2/3 of it in a foil (for easy clean up) roasting pan in oven for only about 5 minutes and then I melted about 8 Dove dark chocolate candies in microwave tossed chocolate in remaining 1/3 caramel corn and put in fridge to cool.

I broke the pretzels by hand which was time-consuming (next time I'll stick the pretzel sticks in a baggie and beat them with something:) and I used regular salted peanuts. I also used salted butter (next time I'll use 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup margarine to see how it works!). The caramel mixture foamed up after I added the vanilla not the baking soda. I think it was the alcohol in my fake vanilla flavoring.:) I put it all in a huge brown bag and had the same problem other reviewers had: the caramel pools on the bottom. So I madly stirred it and dumped it out on two baking sheets to cool. Peeling the caramel-covered peanuts (the nuts sunk to the bottom) out of the bag was a hassle but yummy! I did not need to put it in the oven letting it cool on the cookie sheets was perfect for us. My three-year old loves it. Thanks Rookieswife.:) You rock.",
