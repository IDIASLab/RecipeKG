Your Syrian friend might have made that up, it's ok but it shouldn't be called foul modammas!\nif u like the ingredients of this recipe, just mash the beans up with a fork before adding the rest of ingredients. NO Blender!\n1*Egyptian foul modammas is simply mashing the contents of the can (with or w/out its liquid, depending on preference) mash it lightly with adding lemon juice, olive oil, cumin, little dry coriander, salt &pepper.\n2*Another dish u do the same with adding some tahini (that's the Alexandrian version).\n3*another version add cucumber, onion &tomato chopped very small &mixed.\n all the above 3 recipes are served in room temperature.\n4*another dish served warm is sautee in a Tbsp of oil 2 cloves of garlic splash with diced tomato then add the beans &the same spices but no lemon!(this one is called foul bel ta'aleya)\nIn our mums group we are 6 nationalities & they all love it with all the different recipes!\nyou can also serve it beside eggs for a filling brunch!",
