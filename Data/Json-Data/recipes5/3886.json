I had not heard of this before and when I told my husband I was making this dish with the funny sounding name his eyes lit up and said he'd always wanted to try it has several recipes of his own but hasn't made it. Needless to say it was a hit. The flavors blended perfectly and was a snap to put together. The only change I made was to saute the mushrooms in some butter before adding to chicken. Served with Sesame Asparagus from this site and my husband said it was restaurant quality. Evidently Harry Carey's restaurant in Chicago is known for this recipe. Pls try it.",

I live in Chicago and I never had chicken vesuvio with mushrooms and black olives and green onion usually it is either bone in or chicken breast. I have never had it at Harry Caray\u2019s though. Chicken is usually in white wine and herb sauce with potatoes. I am just not sure of the exact herbs. Chicken Cacciatore has mushrooms and black olives in it. Sorry I hope you take no offense. ",

I knew that 1 hr. would far too long for boneless chicken breasts. Cut potatoes in 1/8ths browned the chicken lightly on each side and baked for approx. 20 mins. before adding sauteed mushrooms. Bake another 20 mins. and even then the chicken was a little dry. The flavors are wonderful and I added more garlic (we also love rosemary). I normally do not rate a recipe that I have had to alter so much but perhaps it will help others who have run into some of the same problems. Will make it again but with more modifications. Certainly will not change seasonings.",
