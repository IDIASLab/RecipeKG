I knew if he knew there was buttermilk in it this smoothie would be doomed. I watched as he quickly drank the first glassful and I asked him to comment while I poured him a refill (this was about 30 seconds later). He said it was \"peachy \" (of course he MEANT \"nectarine-y\") and that there was \"something odd about it - but in a good way.\" Only after he finished the last of this 2-serving recipe did I reveal there was buttermilk in the drink to which he quickly scrunched up his nose. And then he rated it four stars. I never saw him drink a smoothie that fast. I made this exactly as the submitter directed and threw a few ice cubes into the blender as well. Hubs said he appreciated that this wasn't so cold that it gave him an ice cream headache. Maybe that's why it went down in a New York Minute.",

Because the recipe doesn't use frozen fruit or ice it was warm which was not appealing. I added a frozen banana after the fact which helped make it slightly icy and more refreshing. Ice cubes would dilute the flavor even more. I might make this again if I have buttermilk to use up but I would chop up the nectarines ahead of time and toss them in the freezer overnight cut the buttermilk in half and make up the difference with orange juice.",

I took CC's advice and chopped the nectarine up froze it and then used half OJ and half buttermilk. The buttermilk would have been overpowering if I had used the full cup. (and I love buttermilk!) So the recipe as is would be good but not something I make again. With those changes it is now my all-time favorite smoothie!",
