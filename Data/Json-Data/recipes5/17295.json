First take the other reviewers advice and boil the sweet potatoes first since the apples do finish much quicker. The sweet potatoes did take extra time to cook longer than the stated time. Second double up on the brown sugar and flour mixture. The casserole will be much sweeter and taste much better. Third add more apples to the mixture. Otherwise you hardly taste them. Furthermore this is a great recipe and with the changes I will be making this again!",

This helped with the complaint I read a few reviewers had with the potatoes not cooking through - and I only needed to cook them in the oven for 20 minutes total after that. It was a HIT!",
