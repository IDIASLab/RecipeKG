Adjusted the recipe slightly using only 1 tbsp of paprika and only a 1/2 cup of brown sugar as opposed to 1 1/2 cup. Rub was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet; can't wait to try it on some other meats or veggies! Served up with green beans dinner rolls and fresh strawberries for dessert. I like my food spicy so the sweet heat was good for me but DH was gulping down his water. Might reduce the spice a little next time maybe 3/4 tsp instead of a whole tsp. But as is with the adjustments to the brown sugar and paprika I liked it just fine!",
