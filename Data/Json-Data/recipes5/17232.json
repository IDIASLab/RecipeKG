With the bread almost being dessert like, I will try it next time with a little sugar on top. Thanks",

While the bread did turn out delicious I had SO much batter there was NO WAY it was going to fit in only 2 loaf pans let alone the smaller 8\" kind. When I was mixing it up I wondered if someone was playing a trick on us with these amounts and directions.I wound up using 2 very large loaf pans and put the rest in a 9x13 pan. The name is a little bit misleading too because this is really a rich sweet quick bread rather than buns. The bread IS good especially with butter but next time I bake it I'll cut the ingredient amounts in half and I bet I'll still wind up with two loaves.",

I am thinking I might have to lower the oven temp to 325 because my loaf pans are \"dark\". I will also add the fruit to the mixture AFTER I add the liquid ingredients next time because after baking my fruit still had dry flour attached to it. After reading these reviews I was expecting the bread to be alot sweeter. I guess maybe that is the difference between light brown and dark brown sugar. I only had light brown and used that. I am going to try this recipe again tonight but first I will be stopping at the store for dark brown sugar!",
