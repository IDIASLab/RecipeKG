We also used a miso-ginger vinaigrette. Such a delicious salad will definitely be making this with the salmon for years to come!",

I skinned the bottom of my salmon so that the butter/garlic on the bottom of the dish could seep into the salmon from that side.  I thought that the amount of water/lemon juice may have been a little too much because I didn't even use all of that.  I will try it again without even using the water but just the butter, garlic, and lemon juice.  I was afraid of the high heat with my dish, so I did only cook it at 425 but a little longer.  I kept thinking of capers with this, but then that's a whole different dish!  This was very good, so thanks, Jim M!",

I wouldn't use the water next time, or just a little...but I am a lemon girl so I'd use more. Plus some dried dill. It was divine!
