A fun, very delicious, yet high caloric treat! Be sure to buy high quality truffle oil at an Italian or specialty market. My recipe calls for red potatoes, but frozen (shoestring-size) fries do cut down on time and taste almost as good.",

They started to burn and never would crisp up once the truffle oil was added. I actually made this recipe twice. The first time I wrote it as written and when that didn't work I tried soaking the potatoes in cold water and rinsing instead of the microwave step but that didn't work either. The one thing I did like was the cilantro instead of the usual parsley.",
