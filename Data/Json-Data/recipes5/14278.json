I made two changes or substitutions to the recipe. 2 tablespoons olive oil was subbed with 2 tablespoons \"garlic olive oil\" (gifted to me by Marianne) and the 3 tablespoons chopped garlic was omitted. I also used Seasoned Salt from Hawaai (gifted to me by Mauigirl... now that stuff's good!) instead of Kosher salt. We topped salad greens with this oh so yummy salsa and called it dinner. Corn chips added the crunch factor. I will be making this many times this summer. Both as a salad for dinner and as salsa.",

I followed the ratio of the ingredients but used 1 large tomato and a 1/4 cup of onion diced small and the same amount of cilantro chopped. I can't imagine using more than that much raw onion.

I used regular vegetable oil half of it homemade chile oil (dried red pepper flakes in a jar filled with vegetable oil).
