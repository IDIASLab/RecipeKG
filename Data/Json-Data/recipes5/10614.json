Adding juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes to a scramble tastes great, but it's not a common practice since having a pool of liquid under your eggs is considered bad form. I don't care; I have toast. Try to find a goat milk feta cheese for this; it's awesome!",

If they don't have the Bulgarian then Feta from Komotini, Greece or Dodonis, Greece is just as good.  Maybe even better.  I've been doing this a long time but have used Oregano instead of Sweet Basile.  Yes I said Oregano.  Fresh is much\nbetter.  But most folks prefer Sweet Basile.  \nIf I don't have fresh tomatoes I use canned.  Still has lots of flavor.  Black Pepper is a good alternative to red pepper flakes if you don't care for the heat.",
