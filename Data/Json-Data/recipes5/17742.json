You may want to add your own twists (as I did): 1) any nut works well - I used either walnut or almonds (whatever I had on hand and wanted to use up - made multiple batches of these at different times); 2) any dried fruit works well too - I used dried cherries in one batch and dried plums in another - fantastic result; 3) I kept it a little healthier by substituting olive oil for the butter (at a ratio of.75 oil to 1 butter) and used cooked oat groats instead of the rolled oats (as we had oat groats on hand) - even with these subs the flavor is still very good and just a hint of richness (not overdoing it). Kept the sugar amount the same but might cut back just the tiniest amount on that in the future. ONE KEY NOTE: I did find it was important to up the baking time to about 15 minutes.",
