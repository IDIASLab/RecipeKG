Next time I will arrange the potato slices on more of an angle in the muffin tray...the ones I merely stacked didn't look as \"flowery\" as the ones I put in on an angle.  I also covered the muffin tray for the first 4o minutes and then uncovered for another 15.  This ensured that the potatoes cooked all the way through when covered and then added a very nice golden colour with them uncovered.  No burnt bits at all.\n\nFor anyone interested in how these reheat, I tried one in the microwave and that was a little soggy. I tried one in the oven for about 12 minutes and that was better, but became a little too hard - difficult to cut through with a regular knife.  I think the best way is to microwave to get the middle hot, and then stick in the oven for about 5 minutes to get just a touch of that crispiness back.",

Didn't need to cover it with foil, as the potatoes were actually cooked inside before the \"petals\" acquired the proper color. They were relatively easy to remove from the pan, but I caution other cooks against pressing the potatoes slices against sides of the pan cups when forming the rosebuds; they'll burn and stick to the pan, making it hard to remove the roses from it. I served this dish with roasted lamb shoulder at a Christmas party. Big success. Simple, a  little time-consuming, but totally worthy.",
