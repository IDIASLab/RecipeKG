I used a 40oz can of sweet potatoes which seemed more like 2 potatoes worth and cut the other ingredients accordingly. I'd probably do that again because it was so quick and easy to mash them and mix this up. I'd use a little less sugar next time since the pineapple adds some sweetness. I think it needs a little something on top for presentation sake too - maybe cut the sugar in the potatoes and just add a crumb topping. Will try these again.",
