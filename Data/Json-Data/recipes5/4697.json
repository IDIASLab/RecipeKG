We have always made the traditional pesto with basil, parsley and pinenuts; we won't be making that anymore.  This recipe far surpasses any pesto we have ever had.  We had enough scapes to make 2 1/2 batches and all are tucked away in the freezer where many will be given as Christmas gifts. We used fresh lemon juice as some people are allergic to sulfites that are contained in bottled juice; and a lovely black Malabar pepper. Thanks to whomever came up with this recipe.   June 2014; a year later. Just cut the scapes and starting this pesto.  I froze what we didnt use last  summer in cute little jars and gave them as Christmas presents and birthday gifts throughout the year.  Everyone  has requested that they be repeated this year. Guess we will have to grow more garlic to satisfy everyone. 2016 - grew MORE garlic; might need to go into business. Great stuff!   2019 giving scapes away;  over 600 garlic bulbs. Have shared scapes and this recipe numerous times.",

Scapes are quite tough and the resulting pur\u00e9e remained slightly chunky even with additional olive oil. I served the pesto over spaghetti and had to eat some of it on toasted baguette to cut the intensity. It's REALLY garlicky and super strong. I think it might be good if you turned it into a cream sauce or added it to other dishes as a garlic replacement but as a straight-up pesto I'm not a fan.",

The sharpness of garlic scapes is not for everyone.\nAdd 1/2 cup walnuts to the full recipe, 1/4 to half recipe. This will help mellow the sharpness.\nIf you have ample scapes, use just the most tender parts of the garlic scape from the tip to just below the flower bud.\nCut the scapes into 1/2 inch pieces; the scapes are very stringy and will otherwise get caught in the processor blades. Add cut scapes to the processor gradually rather than all at once.\n\nThat said, the recipe worked for me!",
