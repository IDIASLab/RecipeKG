I used \"Taco Seasoning II\" from this site vs. using a packaged taco mix. I also saved time using a pre-made dough vs. making it homemade. I sauteed about 1/4 cup of onion along with the ground beef for a little extra flavor. After the \"pizza\" cooled a bit, I topped it with all the typical \"taco\" toppings to make it nice and pretty: shredded lettuce, chopped de-seeded tomatoes, sliced black olives, thin sliced green onion, and a few well placed dollups of sour cream and homemade guacamole! The leftovers are great too... that is is you have any!",

We browned the beef and chopped onion together, added 1 cup of water and the taco seasoning and cooked it down as directed on the package. We warmed a can of refried beans with enough salsa to make it the right consistency to use as the base sauce. We put the beans down then the crumbled beef and cheese and cooked it in a 500 degree oven. We added chopped tomato and lettuce and piped sour cream over in a sandwich bag with one corner cut off when it came out of the oven. Best taco pizza we've ever had. Thanks for the idea.",

My only complaint with the topping is that the dominant flavor of this dish is the taco seasoning packet which just isn't my favorite.  You must really enjoy the flavor of packaged taco seasoning mix to like the finished product here.  I think it would be far better to follow the recipe and substitute your own spices (chili powder, cumin, garlic, a little oregano, etc.)",

I like to use homemade taco seasoning, homemade refried beans, ground turkey (saves on your food budget and is a little healthier), sprinkle on some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes and I cut the cheese back to a cup to cut back on the fat/calories. To make the refried beans easier to spread onto the dough, stirring in a quarter cup of reduced fat or fat free sour cream helps. GREAT for a quick, cheap dinner or even as a snack for parties.
