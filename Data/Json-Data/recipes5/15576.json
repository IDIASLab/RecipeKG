Her filling included the ground beef nicely spiced with taco seasoning, but also included cooked rice, black beans, and the shredded cheese and diced green chilis.  She mixed all of the ingredients into a large bowl and put a quarter cup of the mixture on each egg roll wrapper.   This saved a little time so as not to top each egg roll individually with cheese and green chilies.   The rest of the directions were identical although she sealed the edges with an egg wash and it was a great lunch accompanied with some chips and guacamole and a mixed greens salad.",

I think maybe a little corn and some white rice might really improve them. It's definitely worth playing around with. As with all egg rolls I make I squirted them with butter-flavored Pam and did them in the oven. We had them with salsa. Thanks!",
