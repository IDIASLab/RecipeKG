I really wanted to join the recipe group with a practical review. I made this twice both times just dumping everything in a crockpot. The first time I made it for the family used pork but cut back on cayenne to 1 tsp. The second time I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and since I made it for myself I added full TBSP (even heaped it) of cayenne. The kids scarfed it down two nights in a row....that's a five star rating by my standards. Husband and I liked our respective versions on the first night we had it so agreed then it was 4 stars. BUT the next night reheated it was even better! I will absolutely make this again both versions in the crockl and wait a day to plate. Given my alterations for my family's taste and the ease of prep it's 5 stars baby!",

I baked them covered for 30 min @ 350 then uncovered for another 10 @ 375. They were good. I thought the mustard was a little overpowering but still good - we all cleaned our plates! I will say that my chops were quite thick more than an inch so definitely decrease the time if yours are thinner. I did skip the pan-frying part as I couldn't see where this sauce would truly \"glaze\".",

I had a lot of fresh cilantro that needed to be used that I put in this and I skipped the hot pepper and pan-frying at the end opting to cover with foil and take the foil off 15 mins before it was done. These chops were so tender it was hard to get them out of the pan. The taste is 'special' enough to stand out from your everyday pork chops.

I made exactly as written except for decreasing the cayenne. When I removed them from the oven they were sitting in a huge pile of water with curds of the mustard/mayo combo floating on top. I drained off as much of the water as I could and then went on to do the skillet step. That didn't work for me either. Time was running out so I just put them back on a baking sheet and drizzled them with butter and some green chilies I was needing to use and stuck them under the broiler until they crisped up some. The flavor was fine and they were extremely tender so maybe it was just my grocery stores poor quality of chops? I am not really sure but I do not see myself attempting this method again. Sorry.",

After cooking the chops in the oven there was no sauce left to baste them in on the stove-top so I just crisped them up instead. They were somewhat dry. EDIT: Will be trying this recipe again but reducing the cayenne way down as well as only cooking in the oven and covered- Seems many reviewers had good results with that.",

Wow was the sauce hot! Glad I used only a teaspoon. The sauce did have a good flavor next time I'm decreasing even the teaspoon. I only cooked these 30 minutes then did the frying at the end. I really don't see any point in that at all. Recipe doesn't say to cover so I didn't cover in the oven which makes the sauce dry up. There is no way to tell with all the sauce when the juice runs clear and fifty minutes seems way too long unless the chops are a couple inches thick. Mine were probably an inch thick and twenty minutes is normally enough time. Otherwise they are all dried up. Good flavor on the sauce though and the chops were done and moist. Thanks Malina!",
