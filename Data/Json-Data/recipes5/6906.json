I hope that everyone enjoys it as much as we did! It will last for up to 30 days if you do not can it.",

I had to simmer it for three hours to get jam consistency rather than a sauce consistency, but the finished jam is delicious! I love it for  a grilled chicken sandwich on rustic bread. I top the chicken with  Brie, very thin tart apple slices, and some fig  jam before toasting the sandwich.",

The biggest changes I made were to substitute red wine for water and to greatly reduce the amount of honey in the recipe. My husband and I love the outcome. It is a warm buttery jam. It will go on the morning toast but I think it would make a wonderful filling for a jam spice cake.. I look forward to harvesting more figs in the future so that I can further experiment with this recipe.",
