When cooking the soup with the carrots and broccoli it took too long and I wonder if that is why the sauce was too thick. Once mixed with the pasta it just didn't seem like there was enough or that something needed to be added (like double the sauce?). I will still try again and despite these minor flaws it was good.",

I also added to the recipe the following: more milk (maybe 1 1/2 cups total) 1/2 cup condensed evaporated milk 1/4 tsp. red pepper a dash of hot salt 1/2 diced onion and a big tbs of chopped garlic. I followed the directions of the recipe except for #3. Instead I poured this sauce over the cut up fresh chicken breast I had in a pan and baked in oven approx. 45 min. or until chicken was done. I kept the pasta separate until serving when I then put some warm pasta on each dinner plate before pouring sauce and chicken over the pasta. You won't believe how good it is!",

Not something I'd write home about and probably not something I'd serve to guests but it was more than sufficient for an easy tasty fast meal. We cubed 1 large chicken breast (for 2 people) and seasoned it heavily with various spices such as garlic pepper garlic salt rotisserie chicken seasoning onion powder and 2 taps of cumin. After the chicken was finished saut\u00e9ing we poured the soup mixture into the pan with the chicken and added (actually accidentally) a cup of Parmesan cheese. We also put a tablespoon of sour cream into the soup to give it more of a tang and then peppered it with ground peppercorns. We then laid this mixture and pasta on top of fresh bits of spinach. It is VERY salty so I'd recommend lower sodium condensed soup or not to salt any of the food during cooking.",
