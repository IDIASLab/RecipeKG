I used mini penne because that's what the little guy chose reduced the olive oil to 1/2 cup per other reviews which was perfect for us and used 3 LARGE tomatoes (not sure of the weight but I know it wasn't 5-1/2 pounds). The flavors of this were outstanding! As soon as hubby took a bite he said 'Oh this is a definate 5 stars'! He also said that he will be asking for this often and that's fine with me because it's simple to make and FANTASTIC YUM! IMO the feta is a MUST! Thanks for sharing.:)",

She wanted the recipe of course! I used 1/2 cup of oil but I think next time I will use 3/4 cup. I think it could have used more red pepper flakes too so next time I will add 1 1/2 tsp. I DID NOT USE BLACK OLIVES. They have no flavor. Instead I used pitted kalamata olives and they were wonderful! Don't skip the feta it's another wonderful flavor that will give you that gourmet taste. You will love it!",
