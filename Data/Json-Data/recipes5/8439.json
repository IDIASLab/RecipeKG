Although I like it from scratch they are more than happy with the packets. I add whipped cream to make it special sometimes but they also ask me for chocolate or caramel drizzled on top and that gets very messy! I always have leftover sprinkles from the holidays anyhow. It makes it more special and they love it! It also works for other holidays to with different colors. Thank you",
