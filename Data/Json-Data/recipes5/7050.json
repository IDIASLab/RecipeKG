I had to adjust the cook time though, adding an extra 30 mins at 350\u00b0F since my pork belly\u2019s fat still wasn\u2019t brown and crispy after the one hour mark. Final result was tender and juicy, with melt in your mouth fat. I did use a roasting pan with a rack rather than a baking sheet and parchment paper since I didn\u2019t want my pork belly to sit in rendered fat. Will be making this again!",
