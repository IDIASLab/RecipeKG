I decided to make only half the recipe so this won't last long for us, but when I have company over the next time, I'll be making it again!  I used 1/2 teaspoon anchovy paste rather than the fillet but otherwise followed the recipe exactly (1/2 teaspoon paste=1 anchovy fillet).  I chopped up a little lettuce to stage a photo for this, thinking that I'd scrape off the dressing and save the salad for dinner.  Silly!  I ate that salad in no time flat!  I know my hubby will love this, too!  Thanks for a great recipe!",

We haven't had it for dinner yet but the finished product we've just refrigerated is EXCELLENT!  I always believe in doing a recipe as its written but I had whipping cream instead of half-and-half and used that.  I also used low-fat mayo as that's what I had.  My other son said there were so many flavors that came out when he tasted it.  We're looking forward to dinner tonight with lasagna to go with it!  Thanks for the dressing recipe!",
