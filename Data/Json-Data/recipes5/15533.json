I used Minute Rice (YES Minute Rice!)instead of the noodles since I was really pressed for time and I couldn't warm to the idea of mexican spices and egg noodles. Added green onions and topped with monteray jack and cheddar.  My son and husband loved it, I liked it and it made four meals for us.  Served it with a lettuce and tomato salad which was perfect balance with this casserole. I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I made changes.  It's a great idea and I love recipes that you can tweak and make your own.  Thanks Sara!",
