Will definately make again and even without salmon the sauce is going to be great on pasta. Late note! I have used this sauce on shrimp that were sauteed prior to adding to the sauce and also on chicken cubes that were sauteed either is terrific. I am not rating the recipe based on changes that deviate from the original because it makes me angry to see that people say I love this recipe but I changed this or that. If they changed it then they didn't use the recipe.",

This dish is extremely healthy even when you add a little cream. It is sure to please any salmon-loving guests! Five stars!!!",
