However, one tip on this recipe was SO helpful--Linda Mc advised to put the popcorn in the pan to warm in the oven before adding the brown sugar mixture, and that was the KEY.  The first batch (with cold popcorn) was a disaster, but with the warm popcorn in the roasting pan already, the mixing was a breeze and the batch was fantastic!  Thanks to everyone for all the tips that are so helpful!",

I used a 12 quart stainless steel All-clad stockpot to pop kernels, make the caramel, and coat the popcorn (the pot was covered in oil from popping the corn and the caramel didn't stick - w/plenty of room to stir).  Note: there is no way you would ever find me mixing this in my sink - impeccably clean as it is, the thought is repulsive to me! (no offense to anyone who thinks this is acceptable).\n\nAnyway, I poured the coated popcorn onto 2 silpat lined sheet pans (was fresh out of nonstick foil).  I only baked one of the sheet pans because the kids begged me to let them keep eating the other one.  For softer/chewy/shiny version, don't bake.  For firm/crispy/non-shiny version, bake, but reduce baking time to 45 min.  I used tongs to break up clumps while baking and cooling.  We loved both versions.  \n\nHints:  \n1.  Reduce butter in half.\n2.  Use a good quality, heavy pot.\n3.  If possible, avoid microwave popcorn.\n4.  Remove unpopped kernels before coating.\n5.  Keep popcorn warm in 250 oven until  ready to coat.\n6.  Stir with a silicone spatula.\n7.  For softer/chewy/shiny version, don't bake.  For firm/crispy/non-shiny version, bake, but reduce time to 45 min.\n8.  And most importantly, if you mix this in your sink, don't give any to me! :)",

Understand I HATE to change something this good, afraid it won't be the same, but I have to say I can not tell the difference.  I kept everything the same but only used a half cup butter. PERFECT!! I use 3 bags ACT II Old Fashioned Natural microwave popcorn.  I have used more expensive popcorn but this works the best. Also, one thing I have learned after making so much of this popcorn is use a name brand brown sugar.  I picked up a store brand once because thats all they had and the coating came out grainny. Now with half the butter I'll probably just eat more. YIKES!!!",

It will all fit and still be easy to stir.\n3.  clean-up is very easy, just soak the pans for a minute in hot soapy water.  All the hard candy just melts away.\n4.  Always buy double the ingredients(you'll be making it again the next day!)\n\n5.  If there is any left over, store in an air tight container or it will get soft.\n\nMake it once and it will be on your top 10 list too!",

I ended up using 3 bags butter popcorn, popped in the microwave.  Picked out the kernels and cooked the rest on my jelly roll pan.  DELICIOUS!  I baked for about 40 minutes.  Next time I'll bake it for the full hour because it was a little too sticky to enjoy without picking at my teeth the whole time and the think the extra 20 minutes will help harden it a little more.  Also, next time I'll try plain popcorn b/c the butter seemed a little heavy.  Still, it was wonderfull and we ate the whole bag in only 2 days.  Thank you!",
