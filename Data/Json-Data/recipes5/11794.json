No need to wait for a pot of water to boil just to stand over it making sure it doesn't boil over. Air fryer to the rescue! While this is a less messy version, the way I chose to cut the corn still lets you dig in and get your hands messy for that authentic touch. The cob creates a perfect handle for holding while the kernels face upright for easy access.",
