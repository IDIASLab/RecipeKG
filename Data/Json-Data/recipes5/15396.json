I read over the chicken skin part and it was already in the trash so I just used a little bit of olive oil instead. The one thing I did change was in the noodles. Not only do you have an extra dirty dish if you do them separately but you lose a lot of flavor with them boiled in water. I recommend adding a bit more broth and then adding them straight in the pot with the soup. That way they soak up all of that delicious flavor.",
