                "reviewBody": "One and a half cups of bulgar wheat for 1 cup of parsley and 1/4 of mint is way off. To be authentic, it should be the other way around, 1 cup of prepared bulgar to about 2 cups of chopped parsley and 1/2 to 1 cup of mint, depending on the personal preference for fresh mint (I go for the cup). and when I say prepared, i mean about 1/2 cup dry and then cover it with boiling water and some salt; let it sit for about 15 minutes, then pour if off into a strainer and run cool tap water over it to cool it. Take it by the handfuls and squeeze as much water out as you can and toss the squeezed bulgur into the salad, this will prevent sogginess as your salad will stay light and fluffy. I also prefer regular onion finely minced to the green onions, about 1/8 a cup, or to taste. Lastly, after you chop the parley (which must be Italian flat-leaf), squeeze the water out of that too (and the mint) before adding it to the salad, again to keep the salad from being watery and soggy. Two pounds of tomatoes sound off too; I'd say two medium sized tomatoes are more than enough. Taboulah should be mostly green in color and dotted with bulgur and tomatoes. Fresh lemon, olive oil, salt, and pepper are to taste. When made this way, it is the ultimate salad with kebabs or rice dishes, and soooo healthy!",
