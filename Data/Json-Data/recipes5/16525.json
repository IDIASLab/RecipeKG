After the instructed cooking time they were completely raw so I cooked for double the time. They were still undercooked and then they turned rock solid over night and we threw the rest away. I made a second batch the next night thinking I had mis-read the directions and they turned out even worse. The butter content seemed way too high and it amounted to a gross mess that I wouldn't dare eat. It was such a disappointment because this recipe was to be a highlight of my husband's birthday weekend. He ate some of both batches with reservations not eating 75% of them. Unless I mis-read the instructions incorrectly twice in a row this recipe is seriously inaccurate. Would not recommend.",
