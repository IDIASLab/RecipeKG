The leftovers were made into meatloaf sandwiches. Tonight I'm going to make homemade gravy and I know it will be wonderful!\nI appreciate all of the recipes you share. 99.9% of them come out perfect. \nPlease stay safe and healthy!!\nThanks again for all you do to make this a better world!\nSincerely, Linda Z",

I had to substitute the cheese with cheddar, and only had 1.12 pounds of beef but still using all the same measurements it was still SO GOOD!!!  Very moist and tender cooked for 55 minutes. I also had just shy of 1/4 cup of taco sauce and had, so filled the rest of the way with extra hot Valentino hot sauce. We like a little spice! Definitely was a good touch! And the crushed tortilla chips? This is a great substitute for breadcrumbs!! Mind is blown! I can\u2019t got back to regular meatloaf after this guys! I served with some garlic saut\u00e9ed spinach on side and. WHOAH! Healthy and delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe with the world.",
