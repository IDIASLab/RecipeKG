I cooked 3 flat tablespoons of the spices in grapeseed oil for a couple of mins to release the flavors......... then used all of that in home made chicken stock with some extra garlic 1 can of tomatoes 1 can of tomato paste and some cream. Add veggies to cook through add cream cooked chicken and 1 can of rinsed garbanzo beans. I have taste tested the sauce but proof of the pudding is in the eating so I will let you know in a bit........... 1/22/16 update using the blend as I made it was spicy but not too hot could have stuck with the same amount cayenne pepper. Ground cardamom i sued the spice blend fresh made and the cardamom was a little pungent. Today we ate the leftover curry spices had blended together better was less cardamomy in flavor and definitely need to ramp up the chili/ cayenne pepper flavors in the next one as there was a lot of mellowing in flavor all round.........good first effort thanks for sharing the recipe.",
