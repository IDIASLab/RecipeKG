It's very easy to make: Just cut and prepare the veggies, put them into the pot, and start the Soup program. Then you can go do other stuff. This recipe yields about 5 or 6 liters of borscht. Lasts me a week. By the way, it's often said that borscht gets tastier in the refrigerator.",

I think maybe using vegetable broth instead of water would have  helped. Maybe a bit of tomato paste, or vinegar/lemon juice for depth of flavor. This definitely makes a lot, so I'll be freezing half for later. I left out the green bell pepper because I forgot to buy one. TIP: use a food processor to quickly shred the beet and carrot.",

I followed the recipe exactly using fresh farmers market produce\u2014 beautiful red beets, unique purple potatoes, big crunchy carrots... all ruined. I\u2019m new to owning & cooking w/ Instant Pot, but big lesson learned\u2014 40 minutes on high is wayyyyy too long to pressure cook a veggie soup.  The beautiful, vibrant colors were completely gone, like they were blanched from overcooking. Everything was mushy and bland. My family loves borscht, we were looking forward to this and it\u2019s just a huge disappointment. I guess I\u2019m just going to blend this and make a veggie stock, it\u2019s not good for anything else. Really surprised there\u2019s a positive review here at all.",
