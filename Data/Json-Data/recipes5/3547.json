I also add 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes.  I don't add any lemon juice anymore (I used to just reduce it by half) but now use low-fat mayo that I find to be quite tangy.  I also double the amount of pepper and add about 1/2 c. of bread crumbs to the cheese mixture, which creates a nice texture and keeps the topping in place. Seasoning the fish with a bit of Old Bay seasoning, as others have done, really adds to the flavor as well. Thank you for helping us eat fish on a regular basis, Phoebe!",

Instead of using regular mayo and butter, I substituted fat free mayo and light butter.  I also sprayed the fillets with olive oil cooking spray before placing them under the broiler.  Since tilapia cooks quickly, I didn't turn them at all.  I let them cook 3 or 4 minutes (oven rack on second slot from the top), added the cheese mixture, and removed them when the cheese started to brown.",

I do line a broiler pan with foil and spray the foil with cooking spray.  The only other thing I do differently is to sprinkle the fish with Old Bay Seasoning before putting under the broiler for the first time and then again before topping with the parmesan mix while it is out of the oven.  I also make sure that I start with the side of the fish that has the dark vein running through the center facing up starting out then it should end up on the bottom when finished.  Low fat mayo makes it even more healthy than it already is without making a big difference.  I've found it best to follow the cooking time closely. It's quick. It's tasty. Try it!",

I've only had tilapia once and wasn't that impressed with that fresh-water, farmed fish, so I went with rockfish (aka: red snapper in warmer waters; rockfish in colder northern waters).  I added to the parmesan mixture:  some garlic powder, paprika, a touch of cayenne pepper & some panko bread crumbs.  This cheese mixture is really what makes the dish; it was excellent and I liked the way the bread crumbs/cheese browned lightly under the broiler.  I only had to broil the fish 2 minutes on each side, plus 2 minutes with the cheese mixture.  Served with steamed broccoli.  Talk about an easy, quick-prep meal!  Thanks, Phoebe!",
