I make a similar pie with peaches...and the best way to not have the pie stick to the plate is to line the pie plate with foil. Then coat the foil with a little butter before putting the caramel topping down. This saves a sticky pie pan and can prevent the pie from bubbling over as well.:)",

Melt the margarine in a separate dish and then mix it in a cold pie plate and continue with directions. I think you'll have better luck.",
