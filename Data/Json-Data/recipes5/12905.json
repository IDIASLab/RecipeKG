It did need to bake longer than the listed time, but that could have been due to the smaller pan making the egg layer thicker than intended. I did find it to be just a bit too salty, so I would not use the added salt in the eggs next time. I used 2 sliced Roma tomatoes for the top, and that worked great. I think adding in some diced bell pepper would be a nice addition to this as well. I served it with a spinach salad and some sourdough toast for a quick and easy dinner. Thank you so much for the recipe!",
