OMG if you haven't had sous vide steak you are missing out on life! Wow!! Between the steak and the duck it was totally worth 150 and space on my counter. I am still experimenting with other foods (meat veggies eggs). Thank you for introducing me to a new cooking method and adding a new and very tasty protein to my diet!",
