I can't say enough good about this recipe and for the record I'm not a huge fan of rice love peanuts but typically dislike them inside my food and a little bit of turmeric goes a long way. The results with this recipe shocked me. The roasted peanuts and everything else combined is absolutely incredible. 5 stars all the way!",

We\u2019ve also made it with and w/o the chilis. So good either way: and that\u2019s part of why we love this recipe: excellent as is, forgiving if you have to make small substitutions. We also didn\u2019t have curry leaves the first time, so we used curry powder: half teaspoon did beautifully! We make ours in the Instant Pot, so we only use 2cups water (in the Instant Pot the base water or stock should always be the same amount as the rice\u2019s volume: 3 minutes, high, followed by 5 minutes natural steam release). We enjoyed this with Indian Butter Chicken",
