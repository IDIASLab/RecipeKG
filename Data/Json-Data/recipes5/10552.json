Throw a clean marble in the jar. When you have a lot of anxious kids ready to shake the jar it goes by pretty fast. When it turned to butter, they used plastic butter knives to spread their own on warmed homemade banana bread. They really enjoyed learning about dairy products and how to make their own butter, almost more than learning to make ice cream in a coffee can.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a good recipe. I've been making butter this way on and off for over 40 years. It is very easy. I would add the following tips though to this recipe to make it extra easy-\n1. Make sure your milk or heavy cream is room tempeture. The butter will break (separate faster if you do this)\n2. Use a plastic jar and lid instead of glass. I have a magic bullet so I use those, before that any food-safe plastic jar was fine. The plastic will allow the heat of your hand to help \"break\" the butter.\n2a. Shake vigorously until you hear a audible pop-this is the butter separating from the milk. Think \" ice cold martini\" when you shake. you want the majority of the milk out in the first shake up. You can't bruise it so don't be gentle, shake it hard and fast....\n3. Put a cheese cloth over the top of the jar and pour off the liquid. Do not handle the butter in the cheese cloth. The cheese cloth can make the butter heat to liquid and you will lose some if you try to press the remaining liquid out.\n4. Place your butter in a room tempeture dish and use a butter knife to whip the butter rapidly. This will remove the remaining liquid and place air in the butter giving it a lighter, creamier flavor and texture.\n5. Place in a butter keep and refrigerate immediately. This will keep it from developing strange flavors.",

Also, I found the answer you asked for,  about the cold water...\n\nNow you need to \"rinse\" the butter. It is important to remove as much buttermilk as possible to keep the butter from going rancid. Put the butter back in your mixing bowl and cover with clean, cold water.\nWith the back of your wide spoon, begin pressing the butter into the side of the bowl. The water will get cloudy as the buttermilk is \"cleaned\" out of the butter. Pour the water off and add more cold water.\nRepeat this process 4-5 times or until the water stays clear. Done!",
