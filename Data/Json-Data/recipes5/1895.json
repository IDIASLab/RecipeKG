I like the addition of the tomatoes and of course the booz - I might of added more than called for as I just glugged some in there.  I also added some whole peppercorns and pureed everything together.  The heat level depends on the peppers themselves and will vary from batch to batch.  Easy recipe, good flavor  and I will make again.  This is one of those recipes that will turn out differently each time and that is no fault of the recipe - much depends on the heat levels of the peppers and tomato size.  Do not expect a consistent result in heat.",
