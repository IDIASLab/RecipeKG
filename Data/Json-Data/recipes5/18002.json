To try it out..first I cut the servings to 12.  I followed the scaled measurements except only used a pinch of cayenne and chili powder.  Concern was it may be too spicy for kids.  I did not have celery seed, so I had to leave it out.  If you like a sweet and spicy sauce you must try this recipe.  I will use this on chicken, pulled pork and ribs.  UPDATE: I've made this again using the celery seed and think I like the taste without it.  Also for a nice thick sauce it is necessary to simmer on low for at least 20 minutes.",

I didn't have any, so I was just going to leave it out, but then my Dad offered to buy me some and when we added it it was SO much better and really added to the flavor. Only suggestions are that oil can be substituted for the butter or left out alltogether, the molasses can be reduced and it's still sweet, and the chili powder, cayenne, and pepper should probably be doubled. Red pepper is also wonderful for the flavor.",

I measured the spices and saved them for later, then I mixed up the liquids over a slow flame, I did not have any red wine vinegar, but I did have some marsala I mixed 1/4c. and the balance I used of white vinegar, I did not add the butter, I figured the fat from the meat would be enough and I wanted it to have some table time.  The sauce tasted good but it had no depth, I only used 3 teaspoons of liquid smoke, and let it simmer for a while.  Once I added the spices it was the bomb!  This is the best sauce I have ever tasted.  The spices are fantastic!!  Whoever thought cinnamon would work in a bbq sauce?  I told my husband, we have to go get a piece of meat to go with the sauce.  Thanks for sharing, this is great!!  I also simmered it for about 1 1/2 hours to thicken, Uuummm finger licken good!!  I will serve it with pulled pork and baked chicken, I am sure you could serve this with fingernails, and toe-jams.it is so goooood!",
