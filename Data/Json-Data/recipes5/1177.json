He ate this for breakfast just about every morning and it reminds him of his mother to this day. I make it for breakfast pretty frequently and it always gives me a good start to my day. I recommend it for you and your family. It can be served with potatoes, toast, milk, juice, etc. to complete a good breakfast.",

You wouldn't think the addition of a bit of lemon juice and olive oil would make that big of a difference but it really does! There's a nice brightness added to egg when it's made this way.
