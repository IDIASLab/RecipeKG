                "reviewBody": "Not sure if I can review my own recipe....it is OK to cut the cooking time to 3.5 or 4 hours as someone else suggested.  Also, if you can find authentic tasso (can be ordered on the internet if you search for it), it makes a great substitution for the ham hock.  If you use tasso, you need to cut back or eliminate the creole seasoning since tasso provides a lot of heat along with flavor.  Andouille is a good substitute for smoked sausage as someone suggested, but again you may need to cut back on the creole seasoning depending on how much spice is in the sausage.  Celery is really optional, I often don't use it.\n\nFinally, someone commented on it being too soupy.  Cutting the water back by a cup is OK, but if you cook it the full 5 hours it gets a little thicker.  In addition, I recommend using high quality medium grain sticky rice (the Japanese rice often used for sushi).  New Orleanians typically use long grain rice, but the sticky rice is delicious and gives it a much thicker, non soupy, texture.  Sticky rice gives it a delectable porridge-like consistency.",

I didn't have a ham hock but had andouille and used that.  I cut the Tony's to 1/2 tablespoon with the andouille.  My 4 yo and 3 yo old asked for seconds but all they could talk about was how spicy it was and I had to refill their waters about 3 times.  It was exactly the right amount of spicy for my husband and I.  If you are going to cook in the crock pot a good rule of thumb is to just cover the beans by about 1/4 inch because the amount of liquid you start with will generally be about what you end with.",

I cut it in 1/4 inch rounds and sauteed them until slightly browned. I used Johnsonville brand, which has only a slight spicy taste. I soaked beans overnight, and then cooked it in a slow cooker. I didn't want soupy beans, so I added only enough water to cover beans, 3 cups. I slow cooked 10 hours, and the consistency was perfect, slightly thick red juice. I really like the spices in this, but I tasted after 8 hours and I thought it needed more salt and spice, so I added a second dash of hot sauce and an extra 1/2 T Tony Chachere's seasoning - perfect.
