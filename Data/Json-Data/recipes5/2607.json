The fruit gives it a light feeling that is a nice change from heavy desserts yet it's quite satisfying for those with a sweet tooth. I added some toasted coconut on top of the icing which was a tasty addition & nice looking garnish. Next time I'm going to try adding a few more oranges to balance the lemon flavor of the cake mix & see if that works. I made it Mother's Day and it was a huge hit with everyone except one picky adult and her two picky kids wouldn't even try it (they won't eat anything that's not plain choc/vanilla). This one is definitely going in my arsenal of summer recipes.",
