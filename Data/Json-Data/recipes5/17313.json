She cooked the bacon first and added that crumbled up to the beans instead of on top.  Then she'd cook the onions in the bacon fat until they were clear.  Then add the cooked onions and everything else to the beans and cook for a much shorter time in the oven.  An hour or maybe less.  That's how I've been making them and they're fantastic!  Excellent, easy, fast recipe for baked beans: the way they were meant to be.  Thanks for this recipe!",

I used half the amount of each and hubs said if I had used what was called for it would have tasted only of molasses and sugar. I sauteed the bacon and onion and added it to the beans with the remaining ingredients, then just threw it in the slow cooker. While these beans were acceptable (three stars with half the sugar and molasses), they are not extraordinary in any way. Frankly, I think a can of Bush's Homestyle Baked Beans would have been just as good without the additional effort of doctoring up a can of pork and beans. ",
