To help that I skipped putting the oil and garlic in the microwave (I tried once but the time stated was too long and the microwave burned it).  Instead I added the garlic right to the butter mixture and didn't use the oil.  Worked fine.  Didn't have fine Herbs so I used, fresh cilantro, parsley, and basil. I will make it again!!",

I added the oil and butter garnish only to the meat side on the flip and was great.  Easy and delicious.",

The salmon I buy in Mexico (frozen) is from Chile and not very oily so that may be the difference. We loved it and will use this recipe many times in the future. Thanks!",
