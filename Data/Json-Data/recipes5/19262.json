Those with nut allergies may wish to substitute soymilk or regular cow's milk for the almond.  Adjust sugar to your taste or substitute with agave syrup or black strap molasses (use half as much).

I noticed that some people had trouble with this recipe and I think it helps immensely to COVER the saucepan.  I always put a lid on when I'm cooking quinoa, so that's what I did with this recipe.  The quinoa was done after about 20 minutes, I then uncovered it and let the extra liquid cook off until I had my desired consistency.  Came out perfect!  I recently switched to (unsweetened) almond milk so I was excited to see a recipe that called for it.  Loved the cinnamon and vanilla.  I added some raisins and craisins and sprinkled some extra brown sugar on top.  Yum!  ****Update:  I now make this with only 1 cup of milk and no water.  Cover and simmer, and it only takes about 10-15 min. to cook.",

If you're expecting this recipe to soak up all the liquid like oatmeal does, you'll be disappointed.  The quinoa I bought (Costco) is pre-rinsed, and the cooking instructions on it are to use 1 part quinoa to 2 parts liquid, brown it in butter or oil, then add liquid, bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 15 min. I have substituted several different liquids, and it always turns out perfect and fluffy like rice.  So, I still gave this 3 stars, because after I altered the liquid amounts to 1/2 c water and 1/2 c almond milk, it did turn out quite nice. I like it with chopped almonds and dried cranberries mixed in at the end for breakfast.",

I was surprised that such a healthy ingredient tasted good. I won't be a fan of quinoa over night but this definitely opened my mind to using quinoa in some other recipes. When I followed the direction I found that the quinoa was still a bit crunchy after it was prepared. I don't know if this is common or not but the next time I make it I think I will cook it a bit longer. Also if you are feeding other people with this recipe it comes out closer to two and a half (very filling) servings. I would suggest that you make this in conjunction with blueberry muffins as the combination of flavors was delicious. Thanks for submitting the recipe!!",

I did not add the water and just used 1.5 cups soy milk since that seemed like way too much liquid from my previous experiences with quinoa (figured I could add the water later if it was needed- it wasn't). I also covered the pan while it was simmering to help with water absorption. After the quinoa was cooked through I took off the lid and simmered until it reached the consistency I wanted. I topped with a bit more brown sugar and some walnuts. This made a delicious breakfast for two (it was not three servings for us) and I think we both could have eaten a bit more.",
