Even being a household that can't use cow's milk, I just made buttermilk using 1/2 cup Almond milk with 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice (when using almond milk in cooking, you need to use the Almond Breeze original unsweetened - anything else or any other brands are too sweet and just ruin the flavor of the dish).  The sauce didn't really thicken up much, so I did add a little flour, but it still tasted fabulous poured over the meat with buttered rice.  The leftovers were delicious!",

It's getting cold here in Ohio but the Sage in my garden doesn't mind and I was able to use it fresh. We had it with rice and broccoli and apple crisp for dessert. The sauce for this meat was great. I added a T of brown sugar to it because my hard cider wasn't very sweet. Thanks for another great recipe.",

The pork simply falls apart into a sauce that's a bit tart from hard apple cider but made mild with creme fraiche. I spooned it over herbed mashed potatoes with roasted cauliflower and delicata squash on the side. My family, normally a talkative bunch, barely said a word as they all but licked their plates clean. I'll serve this up all fall and winter to family and friends because sharing is caring. Thank you, Chef John, for my new favorite way to cook pork shoulder.",
