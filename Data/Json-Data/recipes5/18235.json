My husband even asked afterwards how I'd made it and when he heard how easy the recipe was tried it himself (and it worked for him too). I added some cracked black pepper to the marinade (not much - a few twists) and baked the meat for longer than the recipe said - about 1 1/2 hours. For the mustard sauce I didn't have mustard powder so I substituted 1 teaspoon creole mustard 1 teaspoon yellow mustard and 1 teaspoon prepared horseradish. Simply awesome!",

The two together was an odd combination that just didn t work well - a sort of teriyaki-ish meat with a (hot) mustardy mayonnaise-y sauce. And hot it was!! After I mixed it up I knew if I couldn t tolerate it Hubs never would so I added quite a bit more sour cream and mayonnaise to tone it down and it was still too hot. It ended up discarded. As for the meat it was good enough on its own I guess without the sauce that only made it kind of strange. Also I preferred to roast this at 425 degrees about 25 minutes; much better than the low and slow time and temperature directed. Interesting to try but I wouldn t consider repeating this.",
