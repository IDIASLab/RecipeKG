I used dry roasted peanuts since I have a friend that's allergic to pecans and accidentally baked it an extra 15 minutes (reading way too many recipes = getting a bit confused!) but I think that helped cut down on the sticky factor. I drizzled melted milk chocolate on it and it tasted just like Poppycock. I did forget to put in the rice cereal (oops!) Oh well I guess that means I'll have to make this again!",
