Instead of French bread I used whole wheat cinnamon-raisin bread then skipped adding raisins. Instead of the cream and soy milk I used 2 cups whole milk. Instead of puree I used a can of pumpkin pie filling and then didn't add the cinnamon. I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and added a cup of walnuts. Cooked in two square pans for 40 minutes- but next time will check it sooner. Absolutely heavenly dessert that everyone raved about.",

My guests (my S.O.'s parents and grandparents, all Jewish/Ukrainian immigrants) loved the dessert.  I generally love bread pudding anyway, and this one is no exception.  Other recipes may suggest a sweet topping (strusel or such), but the sweetness of this by itself is perfect IMHO without being too sweet.  I wasn't sure what ramekins were, so I just divided the mixture into two casserole dishes.  One might have been enough, but I wanted to ensure this cooked evenly all the way though.  Thanks, Vivi!",

I used 2 cups of puree pumpkin from my garden which made it an even more special treat. My other small change was that I only had dark brown sugar so I used 3/4 cup of that and 1/4 cup white sugar so the flavor wouldn't overwhelm the pumpkin. This is one of the best bread puddings I've ever eaten. I highly recommend it.",
