My steaks were a bit bigger so I probably should have adjusted the spices accordingly as I thought there wasn't quite enough salt to balance the sweet and next time I will probably add a little pinch of cayenne for a slight kick and a little more flavor depth. Overall though it was very tasty! I didn't use a grill rack and just drained the liquid off my baking sheet whenever I turned the meat. That worked fine. Plus it allowed me to cover my pan in foil which made cleanup a breeze. To speed it up a little I did use the broiler on lower heat to do the final sugar glazing. That worked great. You just have to watch so you don't burn it.",
