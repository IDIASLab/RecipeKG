I made the following minor changes. \n1) I prep my zucchini noodles by drying them on paper towels for a bit with a light sprinkle of salt to help draw out moisture.\n2) I did not boil the noodles because that would add more moisture.  I just added them to the dish when I put in the spinach and let them cook a bit that way. They don't need long.\n3) I used pork hot links instead of chicken sausage for some kick.\nIt came out great and I'm having the left overs today for lunch without cheese or tomatoes and it's still good.",
