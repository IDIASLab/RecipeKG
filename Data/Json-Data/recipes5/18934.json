I did not alter any of the ingredients, and it was absolutely delicious as is. It is definitely definitely mild on the \"heat\" aspect, but adding cayenne or red pepper flakes could easily fix that. I only made two alterations when it came to preparing this recipe: I marinated it for six hours, and I did not grill the skewers. I poured the chicken bites and all the marinated into a large glass dish, covered it with tinfoil, and baked it at 325 degrees for about an hour. The result was incredibly tender and juicy. An absolutely delicious and easy to make dish!!",

I used lite coconut milk made thin spaghetti added shredded cooked carrots raw green onion some of the wonderful dipping sauce put it all onto a pretty plate and topped it with the skewers. A bit of red pepper flakes gave the sauce just a tad of heat. Excellent and thank you hon!!",

Today I didn't have the time to marinate the chicken - just did a quick soy sauce and garlic soak before stir frying it.  But the sauce is the real star here anyway.  It's a perfect blend of flavors.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and added some ginger and chili sauce - simply delicious!  Since I only cook for 2, there's plenty of sauce left over which I'll probably toss with angle hair pasta tomorrow night.  Thanks for sharing this winner - it's my new favorite Thai Peanut Sauce recipe!",

That being said I didn't mind it in the marinade but I tasted the sauce as it was cooking and realized it was not going to do it for me so I added 1 1/2 tsp chile sauce a dash of red pepper flakes and about a teaspoon of minced ginger. Finished it off with lime and it was excellent! Next time I will omit the curry powder from the sauce but still use it in the marinade just to give it a hint of curry flavor. Still I think it was an excellent recipe.",

My family did not like the peanut sauce at all. It just tasted like peanut butter flavored coconut milk... not at all like satay's that we have enjoyed a lot. After tweaking the dipping sauce (a lot) with more soy cayenne heavy cream ginger black pepper garlic and I can't remember what else I loved it. I served over Jasmine rice and a stir fry of snow peas red onion yellow squash brocolli and mushrooms. Even though we didn't like the peanut sauce as written I feel we found a recipe treasure because it was so easy and delicious. I will make over and over again with our changes.",
