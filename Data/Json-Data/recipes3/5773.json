At first I was a bit leary because it wasn't a full 4 stars but I love cooking with Sherry so I decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have Jarlsburg cheese I had a bunch of other cheeses that I mixed for the topping including 4 cheese italian a little mozzarella and a touch of sharp cheddar. My husband and I both loved it. Someone had said it was a little bland but they had skipped the Port wine it totally changes the flavor if you skimp on the Sherry. I will be making this again. Next time for guests. Thank you for posting this recipe.",
