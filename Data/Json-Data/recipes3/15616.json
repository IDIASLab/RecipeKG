I was able to cut the calories down to 465 per burrito by omitting the oil (I cooked the bacon first then cooked the eggs in the same pan using the drippings) using low carb whole wheat tortillas low fat cheese and low fat sour cream. I made the rest exactly as written and didn't add any extras. I thought the flavor was really good. Next time I will add some jalape\u00f1os for a little spice. I really liked having the beans in there for texture. A great high-protein breakfast!",

However the instructions regarding the eggs (are they suppose to be scrambled?) don't really make sense. I assumed the eggs were being scrambled and I added 1/4 cup of water to them so they wouldn't be rubbery. Also I think two cans of chili beans could be used for this and could be cooked into the eggs after the eggs are done cooking. I would also melt the cheese into the eggs while they're cooking. American cheese would've been a great choice for this. I have a few ideas to make this better and wrote about it in my blog. A person could make this over 50 different ways and I think that using your own ideas and adding ingredients you love (vegetables cheeses etc.) would make it your own. It makes so much that once you have it the way you want it the burritos would be easy to wrap up and take on the go.",
