The dollop of sour cream was lovely and i swirled it in each bowl before serving for presentation purposes. This is not only great chilled but also quite delicious hot... great recipe!",

I remember her pressing the heck out of the beets in the strainer to get every last drop of juice so I did the same. The proportions in the recipe are spot on and it tastes great.
