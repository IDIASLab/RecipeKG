I had planned on seasoning the chicken with garlic salt and pepper but I forgot... it was fine but I would definitely do it next time. I checked on the casserole halfway through cooking and didn't like how the half of stuffing on top was totally crisp (read: hard as a rock). So I poured a can of chicken broth over the top and covered it with foil for the rest of the baking time. This worked well but I probably shouldn't have used the whole can as I ended up with some mushy stuffing at the bottom. I think this would also be good with a layer of green beans on the bottom. The best part of this was that the chicken was EXTREMELY moist and cut with a fork. I don't know if the chicken broth did that or not but either way it was very nicely cooked. I had to cook mine for 50 minutes (25 minutes w/ foil on top). Thanks for the recipe I'll be trying it again soon.:)",
