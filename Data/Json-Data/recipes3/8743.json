My Oma made her potato salad earlier in the day and let it sit for 2 hours in the broth. The longer it sits the more flavor. Then the oil drizzles over last just before serving. You will then have a flavorful salad. 10 minutes isn't enough time to soak up. We also omit the onions since half our family dislikes raw onions. Instead we add a little onion juice for flavor. We do not add any mustard. We use white pepper not black. And apple vinegar has more flavor than plain. Lastly you have to use a strong potato which won't fall apart easily otherwise you have mush. Red works well. Sorry I can't add my photo because I just ate all mine!:)",
