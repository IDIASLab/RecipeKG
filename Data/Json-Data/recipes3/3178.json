The red onion and bacon add alot of flavor. I think the reason it was so bland was because of the roasted potatoes. Good way to use up your left over mashed potatoes from the night before!! I also do not use the eggs, cottage cheese-only the noodles, bacon,mashed potatoes, red onion and tons of butter, also to keep the top of your casserole from getting crusty-try drizzling olive oil on top before you bake it.",

I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, I also just boiled and mashed my taters instead of roasting them. Cut the bacon up and crumbled it on top as opposed to layering strips across the top. I fried one red onion in butter for the top...then when it came out of the oven I scattered chopped green onions on top and drizzled sour cream on top. To me green onions and sour cream go hand in hand with perogies and bacon. The whole family loved it, even the kids wanted seconds!",

You can do so many variances of this recipe that it never gets boring. I use DRY cottage cheese instead of regular and I use an extra egg or two. I also have used Italian sausage removed from the casing as an alternate for the bacon. This makes it super yummy and flavourful. This is a recipe that is lengthy in preparation so I usually prepare it early in the day when I have the time and set it aside to be cooked at supper time.",

My husband was irked that it wasn't good either since he had to watch the baby while I fixed this on a Saturday afternoon. I did alter the recipe by mashing the potatoes and left out the bacon and onions but that wouldn't have changed anything in the end result. Where the recipe messed up (and I was too much of a novice to alter it ahead of time) was the fact that the recipe calls for noodles on the bottom then the layer of cottage cheese mixture and then another layer of noodles to be topped with potato mixture. I had tons of noodles left over but by the time I realized it the dish was already assembled. If you make this please add more layers of noodles and alternate the fillings. Mine turned out like cheesy mashed potatoes and have a huge 9x13 pan full. We only ate just a small amount each. At least it was an inexpensive dish but being a new mom my time is very valuable.",
