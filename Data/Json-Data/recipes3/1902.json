I did use 2 cans of basil, garlic and oregano diced tomatoes with their juices instead of fresh tomatoes other than that I followed the recipe. The only reason I gave this a 4 stars is because the sauce was watery, maybe I will use less of the juices and let it reduce before serving. I will definately be making this again.(Update: I did make this again and still used 2 cans of basil, garlic and oregano diced tomatoes but drained the juices from one can and then while cooking I let the sauce reduce until it was thick enough and not watery.)",

Because the tomato mixture doesn't really make a sauce, I added 1 cup of white wine and just under a cup of chicken broth.  Let everything simmer and it was simply delicious and light. The grated parmesan cheese is an essential finishing touch.  I will definitely include this dish in my regular rotation.  Thanks!",

I used a good amount of onions & chopped garlic cloves as well as hot pepper flakes. I also used diced tomatoes from a can and i thought it was perfect. Next time I will probably marinate the chicken in olive oil & fresh basil to give it more flavor. Other than that not only did it taste fantastic but it looked fabulous as well!! (it even was good as leftovers the next day!!!) I made this again and this time marinated the chicken overnight in Sun Dried Tomato dressing. It was a great touch! Also I used Hunt's diced tomatoes with Basil Garlic & Oregeno flavor it definelty contributes to the overall taste",

I think our hot pepper sauce has lost its kick so this dish didn't have any peppery zip but the overall flavor was great. I don't think this would have been nearly as good with canned tomatoes so we will save this recipe and make it again during fresh tomato season. I can also see either substituting shrimp or tofu for the chicken or leaving it out altogether for a change of pace.",

Also added a few sundried as suggested by another 'viewer. Only hot sauce I had on hand was a Thai Garlic Chili Pepper Sauce that I might have gone just a little heavy on... hmmm good.... And to quote a favourite AD of mine... \"I love to cook with wine. Sometimes I even add it to the food I cook.\" so I did. Added a big splash of white wine. Scrump-dili-oo-tious.!.!.!

The recipe lacked as sort of taste other than the salty taste of tomatoes. I really disliked this recipe. You may just be better off cooking chicken and adding pasta sauce. I was hoping for a wonderful valentine's day dinner and it tasted like I cooked pasta and ate it plain.",
