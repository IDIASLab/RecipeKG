I had all these ingredients except the whole wheat pita.  I have regular pita's (wish I had purchased the WW ones, now).  I made this recipe because of the ease and speed in prep and it just sounded good.  This is really, flavorful.  Will make an excellent hurry up dinner and would be great with a cup of hot soup during the cooler days ahead.  Definitely a keeper and I appreciate you taking the time to share!",

I also served it as an open-faced sandwich instead of pitas because the store was literally out of pitas (face palm.) When I make it again, I'll probably add something to the mixture to add some moisture - mustard or ketchup or some acidity would be nice - but this was a good, quick, filling meal that my husband really enjoyed.  It came together very quickly and I often have the ingredients on hand.  I'll just use a bit more seasoning next time.  Thanks for sharing this!",
