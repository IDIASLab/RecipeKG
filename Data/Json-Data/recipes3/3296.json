However, since I'm pregnant and also have small children, I was a bit leary about the eggs, since they never get cooked, so after I got the chocolate and egg mixture blended, I heated it to bubbling for a minute or two so the eggs would not be raw.  I waited for it too cool off before adding the marshmallows and peanuts and then stuck it in the fridge.  It took way more than 2 hours for it to cool (I had to leave them in the fridge overnight) but that could be because I cooked it a bit more.  Once they finally hardened they were wonderful and I gave them out as Christmas gifts. :) I will try this recipe again, but maybe just omit the eggs next time, since they don't seem to serve any real purpose that I can see, anyway.",

Unfortunately after 5 hours in the fridge they had set up but the chocolate was still really gummy so I threw them in the freezer. Even frozen the chocolate was still  really sticky. I would love to try this again with maybe 1 egg instead of 2. Perhaps my eggs were to large and thats why I didn't set up. I didn't feel comfortable taking them like they were to share with others.",
