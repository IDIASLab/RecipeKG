I have to admit that I did sprinkle a little shredded cheese on top before adding the cracker crust and as a cheese addict I think it made this casserole even better.

Oh sure you can't really deviate on things like baking soda and stuff like that but most recipes are pretty forgiving of some tweaking here and there. I was so sure I had everything I needed to make this for dinner only to come home and find I had no mushroom soup OR sour cream. I used cream of broccoli and skipped the sour cream. I topped with the buttery crackers as indicated in the recipe (I used Ritz) but added a sprinkle of some grated italian cheese I had leftover in the fridge. What can I say? It tasted great. I'm sure the sour cream would have made it better but this worked out fine. I will try again with the ingredients specified but it got me thinking - you could probably do a \"broccoli casserole\" with frozen broccoli condensed broccoli soup and the other ingredients here. Maybe I'll try that...",
