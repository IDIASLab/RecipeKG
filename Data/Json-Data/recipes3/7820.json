I skipped all the meat except the shrimp added way more curry and my rice was done after about 22 minutes. THIS ROCKED MY WORLD! It was like some sort of amazing curry shrimp risotto with way less stirring and only one pan. I will make this again and again and for company and spread the word to friends and family near and far. I think the name may be preventing more people from trying this. Get over it people! This dish amazes under any name!",

Subbed onion and garlic powder for the real thing (yes yes I know but they hate me!) used cubed chicken breast instead of thigh used peeled deveined shrimp instead of prawns used basmati rice because I forgot to grab glutenous and added a splash of chicken broth because my can of coconut milk was only 13 ounces. Made it all in my stock pot but it would have probably just fit in my big saute skillet. DH enjoyed it but would have liked more curry as he likes things spicy. I however thought that the delicate flavor of the spicing as is was perfect. Only thing I might do next time is try marinating the chicken in advance. Thanks for the delicious antidote to bored cuisine!!",
