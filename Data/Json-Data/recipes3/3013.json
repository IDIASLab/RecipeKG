First bite in and the sweetness from the carrot was almost too much for me but then the heat sneaks up and gets you. The heat part was nice but the sweetness not so much for me. My husband on the other hand started going nuts over it right away. He really liked the sweet/heat combo and everything about the sauce. So with that being said I'm giving it a 4. I like that it is packed full of veggies but just not sure about the carrots.",
