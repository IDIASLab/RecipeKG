This potato fiend will have two, please. Back then their secret was the copious amounts of chicken fat, aka schmaltz, but here I'll show you how succeed without it. Leftover corned beef really shines in these, but anything goes, as long as the base is mashed potato spiked with onions and fried in lots of fat.",

They tasted great and I was eating them like crazy for a week, but man slicing the dough the way he does and creating the little knish shapes was hard a.f.  I think it may have been because my filling was too warm.  I'm gonna try these again after cooling the filling for a while and see if that makes shaping them any easier.",
