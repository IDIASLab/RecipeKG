Used Minerve brand chestnuts (Whole Foods) because they were highly rated in our newspaper food section. One thing I did differently was to add the wine to the vegetables to finish them and to cook off some of the alcohol before adding vegetable stock and the chestnuts. I think the garnishes (sour cream cayenne perhaps some parsley) can help the eye appeal although I don't mind it.",
