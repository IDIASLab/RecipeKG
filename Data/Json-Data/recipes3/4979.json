We didn't add the crab when we added the whiskey (used Jack Daniels) in case the whiskey flavor was strong & needed to be simmered some to tone it down...which it was. We simmered for about 30 minutes & thought the whiskey flavor was still too strong so we added about 1/2 cup of heavy cream & 1/2 cup of chicken stock. After adding the crab & topping our bowls w/ a bit of grated asiago cheese it was perfect! Served it w/ garlic toast & salad w/ vidalia onion vinaigrette...can't wait to have it again!",
