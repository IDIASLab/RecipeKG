If you're looking for an easy cake with a delightfully unique taste this is the one. The bottom layer has the consistency of a moist cake whereas the top layer has more a pudding-like texture...this is how a chess cake (and pie) is supposed to be. It is absolutely a delicious cake that I will be proud to serve to my inlaws tomorrow. Oh and I used fat free cream cheese and low fat butter (just added an extra tablespoon of butter in each layer which puts back the liquid that low-fat butter is missing). I also added 3/4 cup of crushed pecans to the top of the bottom layer. I feel that added JUST what the recipe needed to be perfect! By the way heat it up for a few seconds in the microwave and serve with ice cream. Wonderful! Enjoy! Ally",

There are so many variations you can make too.  You can use lemon flavored cake mix to make it what my mom calls \"lemon squares\" or you can follow the recipe posted here and add approx. 2 cups of chocolate chips to the top layer for a chocolately twist.  Either way is great!  One warning though, this isn't a \"normal\" cake.  If you insert a toothpick to ensure it's thoroughly cooked, it won't come out clean.  Look for the top to brown as this is a very gooey.",

I think I might like recipes that call for just one or two eggs a bit better. I think an addition of a splash of vanilla wouldn't hurt for the topping. Good advice to spray your hands with vegetable spray or your spatula to get the base in easily. I can see how you could add things to the base like nuts or coconut and play around with the topping - think lemon zest with a lemon cake base. I also think the bake time is a bit long - I should have pulled mine after about 45 minutes and I know my oven temp is right since I moniter it with an oven thermometer. Got a bit brown esp. around the edges.",
