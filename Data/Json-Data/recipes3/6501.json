I will try it again (And this time remember to pick up fresh parsley first), cook the shrimp less initially since 20 minutes of baking would cook them through, and reduce the Vermouth to 1/2 cup.  I will also cook the tomato/ vermouth mixture until the tomato juices reduce some, too.",

I have my doubts about serving six people unless you include h'orderves, salad and bread.  Great quality meal.  I used a little more garlic than suggested, about three large cloves, and I used large cooked shrimp for ease.  Other than that I followed as prescribed.  You can also prepare the night before, just don't bake.  Pull it out of fridge and let it get to room temperature then bake till parts of feta just start to turn brown.  You must serve over orzo (must)!  I've made this several times.  Good luck. Top Notch.",

This recipe with only a few additions & substitutions is BY FAR the BEST shrimp dish I have ever found!! I have made it on numerous occasions and I thought I would share how I perfected it for my boyfriend and my tastes - maybe you will agree: I more than double the garlic; use about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of 1/4 tsp (we like spicy food in our house!); add some crushed black pepper (to taste); use a teaspoon (instead of 3/4 tsp) of dried oregano; substitute a tablespoon of DRIED parsley instead of fresh; use sliced roma tomatoes IN ADDITION TO the canned diced tomatoes (I like to use the cans that have basil oregano & garlic already in them); and I add a bag of fresh spinach to the vermouth and tomato mixture as it is cooking. I usually broil the mixture in the oven for a few minutes before I take it out just to brown the feta a little. After it is finished baking I serve this mixture over orzo (a wonderful suggestion I read)....it is absolutely delicious!! Great Garlic Knots (from this site) go wonderfully on the side of this dish!!",
