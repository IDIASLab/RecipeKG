If you like different flavored margaritas and can find prickly pear syrup this one is definitely worth a try.",

As it turned out cooking down all 3 provided the right amount of juice to make 4 margaritas. I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut back a bit on the lime juice. I used almost the amount of triple sec in the recipe but not quite -- I trusted the recipe but we tend to prefer a bit less sweetness in our drinks. Needless to say the drinks were a hit and I will contact the market first thing tomorrow to see if they regularly carry prickly pears!",
