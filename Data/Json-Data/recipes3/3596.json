I served this to a bit of a crowd so I doubled everything. Instead of the crawfish I used 1 pound of crabmeat and about 1/2 pound each of bay scallops and cooked shrimp. I used 1/2 the amount of red pepper flakes since some of my guests do not like too much spice. For the wine I used a bit of sherry and white wine for the balance. Delicious! Thanks Kathleen you are a life saver!",
