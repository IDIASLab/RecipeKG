I had to make some minor subs based on what I had: a different form of pasta dried oregano avocado oil in place of butter veggie broth rather than chicken regular parchment paper. And some more significant subs: celery in place of asparagus queso fresco in place of goat cheese sun dried in place of cherry tomatoes fresh celery leaves in place of basil. My dish resulted in some milder flavors but was delicious none-the-less. With advance preparation I'd definitely make it with goat cheese and basil next time. I think the possibilities are broad for the types of veggies one could use.",
