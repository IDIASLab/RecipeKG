The amounts are approximate and you can adjust to suit your own style/taste. Garlic and olives would probably be great in this too, even capers. What the heck, throw it all in.",

It was very flavorful and not Bland at all. I use a whole can of our favourite pasta sauce & some fresh garlic and mixed it in with the squash. I then layered it like the recipe said starting with a third of the squash then onions and spinach and cheese. then repeated the layers until all the ingredients were gone. this will definitely be a staple in our house as a healthy meatless option. my only change for next time is it I might saute the onions and spinach beforehand and add shredded cheese to the top. give it a try you won't be disappointed!!!",
