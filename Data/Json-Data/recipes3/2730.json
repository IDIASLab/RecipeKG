My host mother would use watercress, two potatoes, creme fraiche, salt and pepper. She would cook the vegetables in water, puree them with an immersion blender, and add creme fraiche. This is 10 times easier and healthier, and it still tastes amazing!\n\nShe would also sometimes add broccoli, a great addition.",
