I also misread the ingredients and used ricotta cheese, instead of \"ricotta salata\" with which I'm not familiar.  I made it in a casserole dish instead of a 9x13 - I think with the amount of vegetables it would have been really hard to make 2 layers in such a big pan.  The spaghetti squash makes a wonderful substitue for pasta in what would have been a lasagna type dish.  Very flavorful and we will definately make again!",
