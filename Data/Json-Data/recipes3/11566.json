Followed the recipe but started w/ thawed chicken as I did not catch to cook it from frozen until it was too late but that was fine. Added more liquid to the shredded chicken than called for to keep it moist and add more flavor. Loved the chipotle cream sauce (I added extra chipotle b/c we love it). Served on WW flour tortillas w/ shredded cheddar tomatoes red onion slices and the sauce. All in all this was nice for a change and the guys liked it. Thanks for sharing.:)",
