I put a layer of 1/2 of the mixture in a 8X8 baking dish then added a layer of egg noodles (about 2 cups prepared) then the rest of the casserole. I smoothed the ingredients to \"seal in\" the noodles. Added about a 1/4 cup shredded Jack on the top and baked. Instaed of frozen mixed vegetables you could use any combination you like for example carrots and corn. I'll post the actual recipe I ended up with under \"Vegetable and Egg Noodle Casserole.\"",
