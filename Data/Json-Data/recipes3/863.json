I cut back on the mayo and marinated the shrimp in a red wine vinaigrette... I wanted more of a \"shrimp cocktail\" type flavor than creamy. Again the Catalina was the key... very good.",

Macaroni really dilutes or absorbs a lot so I would double the amount of dressing if you want more flavor. Someone mentioned canned shrimp tasting funny. I have read you should soak them in ice water then drain well.",

I thawed some frozen salad shrimp & used those instead of canned & I opened up my last jar of Texas Christmas Pickles (from this site)& gave them a chop & used that instead of the sweet pickle relish. The pickles are sweet & spicy & they worked perfectly. I also used fresh garlic instead of salt. Who knew that catalina dressing mayo (I used lite) & sweet pickle relish would make such a tasty dressing for pasta?",
