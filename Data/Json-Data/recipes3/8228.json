I doubled the recipes and made 12 pierogies and used 1/2 whipped butter and 1/2 lite margarine to lighten it up. The best unintended part of the recipe was I made a couple steaks yesterday I made on the grill. I took them out of the fridge and sliced them and sauteed them in the pan after I removed the pierogies and they got a nice flavor with the butter onion garlic parsley combination left in the pan. So it made an easy complete meal in one pan today.",
