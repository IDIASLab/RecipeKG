Thankfully as moist as the cake is I was able to return it to the oven even after it cooled for 20 minutes and it was fine. Still gooey!! I followed the recipe exactly and I'm a seasoned cook so I'm not sure what happened. If the submitter reads this please respond with any tips as the cake is sinfully delicious and I would like to make again.",

I also added a teaspoon of coconut extract into the filling which brought out the flavor of the coconut in the cake. I gave it four stars because of the 4 cups confectioners' sugar but if you cut it back then I would say it's five stars. It sure didn't last long in our house!",
