Tonight\u2019s dinner, with this entr\u00e9e, exceeded my hopes and my expectations.  What an incredible dish, very similar to one I had recently in Rome, Italy.  Everything about this recipe is spot on, from the ingredients list to the cooking method, to the timing.  I followed it nearly identical to the recipe, only using olive oil for the vegetable oil and omitting the basil.  After years and years of trying to convince myself otherwise, I\u2019ve finally accepted and embraced the fact that I just don\u2019t like it.  I didn\u2019t have fresh red chile pepper, but a pinch of red pepper flakes worked in its place.  The fish and shrimp were tender, sweet and mild, and the fresh tomato sauce was perfect with it.  I served this with Crazy Delicious Linguine with Peas and Bacon, also from this site, but a simple pasta with garlic and olive oil would have been equally as good.  Kudos to the submitter of this recipe \u2013 nicely done.",

I used a 14-oz can of diced tomatoes, left out the prawns, added some green olives, and used a pound of fish, which made four servings.   Grilled veggies with some balsamic vinegar were the perfect side dish.  Crusty dinner rolls were great for sopping up the yummy pan juices.  Would make a great dinner party dish.",

There is plenty of mixture for the fish... and the fillets don't fall apart with less liquid.. Thank you for sharing. Update...  The prawn or shrimp do not make much difference in this recipe...
