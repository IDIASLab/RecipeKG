I wanted all fresh ingredients and I wanted it to taste as closely as possible like the salsa from a Mexican restaurant I used to frequent many years ago.  I think softening the onions is key in this recipe. I was a little concerned that it might be hot with that many jalape\u00f1os, so I used the smallest ones I could find.  Not to worry!  I ended up adding 3 more and the heat was perfect.  I also doubled the salt.  PERFECT!",

Little extra flavour without the heat.. Oh love the tip about the onions most never say to do that.. I didn't understand the thing about the cilantro so I didn't do it.. Tasted great the question still remains could it taste better if I do that.....",
