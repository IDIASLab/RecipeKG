I also upped the amount of broth to 8 cups. I did make it with 6 cups the first time and it seemed lacking in broth. I also use Better Than Bouillon instead of broth out of a carton.

All of these recipes say you have to cook your noodles separate but our stove was broken and things take forever to sautee in my pressure cooker so I took a chance and pressure cooked the spaghetti noodles at the same time worked great!! I also added some extra Italian mix seasoning. Easy and tasty!",
