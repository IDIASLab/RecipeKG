The changes I made were: I put all the ingredients in at once after the meat was browned--except for the cabbage which was added in the last hour; I added a few shakes of tobasco sauce which made it delicious for our taste. I let the pot simmer for about 2 hours. We loved it and will definitely make it again during our cold winter days.",
