I took some of the other reviews suggestions and did the following: cut the oil in half - used 1/4 cup of white wine instead, lightens the oily taste, minced 5 cloves of garlic. Slipped in a few LIGHT shakes of red pepper flakes - be careful - this added A LOT of flavor. I combined all ingredients except the clams and allowed to them to come to a boil. I prepared the sauce in a large deep saucepan. Added the clams 2/3 minutes before the Spaghetti is al dente. Drain pasta and transferred it all to the sauce, cooked it altogether for 2 minutes and removed. Don't let the clams cook too long, they will come out rubbery.",

The compilated recipe follows:\n\n1/4 c. butter,\n2 T. flour,\n5-6 large garlic cloves minced,\n1 T. dried parsley,\n1/4 tsp. dried oregano,\n1/4 tsp. dried basil,\n1/4 tsp. black pepper,\nred pepper flakes-optional-to taste-pinch,\n1/4 c. olive oil,\n1/4 c. white wine,\n2(6.5 oz) cans minced clams in juice,\n1/4 c. whipping cream,\n1 lb. linguine,\nRomano or Parm. for sprinkling on top.\n\nMelt butter in deep saute pan.  Add flour and spices, combine well.  Add olive oil, wine, and juice from clams.  Simmer over low heat until well combined and reduced a bit.  Cook noodles.  Right before adding cooked noodles to sauce add the minced clam meat and whipping cream to sauce--this keeps clams from getting rubbery.  Toss well to coat.  Serve with grated cheese.\n\nMade for anniversary dinner.  Easy, impressive looking, wonderful!\n",

The sauce was very thin and watery even though I later tried to doctor it up by adding a slosh of heavy cream. The flavor of the sauce was pretty good. But it was much too thin and watery and oily for my taste. Not a fan of this recipe wanted something more rich and creamy. Just my personal preference.:-)",
