Chuck is a fatty cut so I didn\u2019t see the need to add ANY oil, let alone so much.  In fact, I trimmed the roast of a good deal of the fat before throwing it in the Crock Pot (rather than the oven).  I used no oil, and only one cup of beef stock, even tho\u2019 I doubled the recipe.  I couldn\u2019t see adding what would have been two cups of stock only to \u201cdrain and discard 80% of the liquid\u201d as the recipe directs!  In addition to doubling the remaining ingredients for my 3-pound roast, I added a teaspoon each of Mexican oregano and salt, and a good handful each of chopped Poblano peppers and onions.  Since it would spend 8-10 hours in the Crock Pot, I skipped the marinating process, simply putting all ingredients in the Crock Pot from the start.  This was excellent; tho\u2019 I must stress that the oil can/should be eliminated and only use half as much stock so you don\u2019t need to discard any!  I used this to make shredded beef enchiladas and we both loved it and are looking forward to enjoying this once again as tacos.",
