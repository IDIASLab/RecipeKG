It takes a lot longer then cooking regular breakfast stuff. It smelled really good coming out of the oven. After taking a few bites we both noticed that it leaves a real eggy after taste and the oregano was not needed. I wont be using this recipe again.

It was a bit overpowering just mixed in maybe roasting it with the potatoes would be better. Also I would just spray the pan with cooking spray and forget the melted butter. The bacon produces a lot of fat and stirring the potatoes a few times while they are roasting will coat the potatoes with bacon grease.",
