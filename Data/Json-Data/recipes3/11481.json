I don't have a food processor, so mincing and chopping was a little time consuming, but well worth i! I made this exactly as written, and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  I found myself eating 2-3 portions, since the servings were on the smaller side. Very low calorie and full of fresh flavors. This would also make a great topping for chicken or fish. I think next time I will make some sort of dressing for added flavor, made with olive oil and either lemon juice or red wine vinegar. Thanks for sharing Jewel!",
