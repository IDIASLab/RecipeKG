I steamed my cauliflower and then shocked it in cold water as another reviewer did so the cauliflower doesn't become mushy. 4 eggs is too many for one head of cauliflower unless you happen to find one of gargantuan size. I found 3 to be sufficient. The dill relish really makes this, I can't stand sweet pickles or sweet relish, and the dill relish gives it the kick it needs along with the mustard. I had made this quite some time ago after seeing the recipe posted on Facebook. I'm glad to see it here, to be able to review a very good recipe.",

However, I tried it, since I had a head, and then, after seeing the recipe, a \"craving\" for potatoe salad.  It was pretty darned good, took care of the \"gotta have its\", and I felt I could indulge with another small serving since it was low carb.  Remember to make ahead & chill for several hours before serving, so the favors meld.  I used bread & butter pickles tho, since I like \"sweet\", they were all I had in the pantry AND, we're snowed in.  HTH!!!           Blessings!!",
