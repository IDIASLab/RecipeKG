We used can chicken (don't like tuna)(I put in in a bowl and separated the chunks with a fork), used the little salad macaronies, red pepper instead of green and add chopped cucumber.  We also used lite miracle whip instead of the mayo (we're not big mayo fans).  I'd been looking for an easier way to make chicken mac salad and this was perfect.  You couldn't even tell that the chicken was canned, and it was so much easier than boiling that chicken all day.  thanks:-)",

I didn't have any tuna, so I left it out, but added chopped boiled eggs.  Instead of celery, I like to add minced onions and some paprika.  I've read over other macaroni salad recipes that add some cider vinegar to the mayo.  I'm thinking that would give it a sweet and sour taste, which I think I might try when I DO make this again. My company loved it!! Thanks bunches Jennie.",
