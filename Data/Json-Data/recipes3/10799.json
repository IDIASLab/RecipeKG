The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the batter, which was a great addition. I also did a few slices of zucchini to see how it would turn out, and it was equally as delicious! I will def be using this recipe for o.rings (AND fried zucchini) again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
