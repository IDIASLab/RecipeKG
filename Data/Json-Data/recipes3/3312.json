I reduced the biscuit mix to 1/2 cup since i wanted it to be less bready and substituted a 1/4 cup of milk for the oil to make the dish less fattening.  Finally the only other change I made was to grate the zuchinni.  The dish had a wonderful light texture.  Thanks for this recipe!",

I used Italian seasoning instead of seasoned salt, fresh parsley instead of dry (so doubled it), 1/2 C Colby Jack instead of a 1/4 C Swiss, only 1/2 Bisquick, mostly milk instead of oil (but a little oil), and grated one zucchini instead of slicing both. Also added a 1/4 tsp of dill weed and 1/4 tsp of ground mustard. Wound up cooking it for about 40 minutes in an 8in pie dish.  Both of my guests talked about it throughout the meal and asked repeatedly for the recipe.  One commented how she now knew what to make for brunch for her vegetarian roomie.",

I wasn't sure how it was going to work out--I used my smallest zucchinis and it still looked like too much zuc to bread, but it worked out beautifully. It's perfectly spiced and seasoned, the baking time is perfect for the zucs to come out moist and not slimy. The bread is a nice egg bread. It was really delicious. I sliced the zucs as thin as I could get them--I'm no chef, so the slices were rustic rather than paper. So let's call them 1/8\" slices, and rounds. I grated the parmesan off a block I had around, rather than using the stuff from a shaker. I didn't have any seasoning salt, so I used paprika and some other stuff with a little salt. My kids ate it and my husband liked it, so it's a keeper in my book.",

But darn, this is good!!\" First time made this as directed, and found the zucchini hunks too chunky, the biscuit mix too bread-ey, and the oil, well, just too oil-ey. Went back and read reviews, and changed accordingly; i.e. grated the zucchini and wringed out liquid, halved the baking mix, reduced the oil and added milk (oh, and for a carnivore, added some leftover cubed Easter ham), and ohhhwowohhhwow, this was good! After it sat at room temp., eating a square was like picking up a savory \"brownie\", and microwaved the next day, just as good. Can't wait to make again w/ a whole slew of veggie, meat and cheese variations that I have in my mind grapes!",

I was surprised how the dish stuck in the pan even with cooking spray and all that oil. I would try and use al alternative to the oil next time. The dish was ok but not fabulous. I was expecting something a little more eggy and less bready.",
