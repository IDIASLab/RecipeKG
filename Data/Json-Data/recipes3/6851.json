I made this again last night and I realized that I use a heck of more spices than I enter in the original posting; i use 1Tablespoon of paprika and 1 Tablespoon of cummin. I fried the chicken for around 4 minutes epr side to get it seared and lightly brown on all sides. I used i cup of white wine (much to my husband's complaint that I was using his good wine on the chicken) and one cup of chicken broth. The peas I add at the last minute (usually 10 minutes before removing from the stove) and if the broth is too liquid i add 1 to 2 teaspoons of flour mixed with some water to thicken the sauce. I learned this recipe from my mother and she learned from her mothe and so on so I apologize for not having ever written the recipe more accurately - now you have it! thank you for your comments and reviews. I am giving it a 4 start for my own oversight!",

That being said I always cook a new recipe as it is written the first time I cook it. Though I read Patty Q's review so I did use 1 cup of white wine instead of 1/2. The liquid was very watery so I added 1T of corn starch and 1T of cold water mixed it up and poured it in. I did that 3 times. It was still watery. I might not have waited long enough. I guess how thick the liquid should be is a personal preference. The chicken was good. It had good flavor. Next time I might at some cayenne pepper to give it a little zip. The fried potatoes were outstanding after they have been sitting in the liquid for a few minutes. Crispy yet soft. I am glad I tried it and I will cook this again and tweak it now to my tastes now.

Tweaks: used merlot instead of white, added fingerling potatoes whole w the other vegies, rather than frying separately, boneless breast (3 lg. halves) and made extra sauce/gravy w leftover seasoned flour that breasts were dredged in before browning, extra garlic and increased broth and wine by another half. Served w small seasoned baguette toast slices, this became a bit of a stew as I just let it simmer for 90 minutes and increased the flavor to a wonderful aroma. The toasts used to dip in complimented this dish and whole effort created a one dish heavenly meal!",
