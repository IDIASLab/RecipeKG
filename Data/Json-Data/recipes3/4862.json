Anyway.  I made the fish but didn't put it in sandwiches.  We just had it over rice.  The butter and lemon juice left in the pan actually made a really good sauce for the rice and the meal was quite tasty (not to mention easy).  I think it would be good on a sandwich with the ranch and barbecue sauce, too!",

I deducted a star because I didn't care for the steak sauce/ranch dressing combo. It was odd and didn't pair well together, or with the fish. The sandwiches were much better with tartar sauce on them instead. I also added some lettuce and grilled bell peppers to the sandwiches for a bit more substance. Great recipe for the fish, I will use it again! Thank you!",
