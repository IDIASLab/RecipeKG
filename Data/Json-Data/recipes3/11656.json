Here in the South we fry our okra in cornmeal so it was an honest mistake on my part. On that note I could not get the breading to stick to the okra and ended up having to dip it in egg. I think an egg would be beneficial if you were using corn flour too. Just my opinion. Stuffing the okra was a bit time consuming and then you lost some of it while shaking it in the breading. I think next time I would just season the cornflour or cornmeal with the stuffing ingredients and call it good. Overall good recipe fun and worth trying.",
