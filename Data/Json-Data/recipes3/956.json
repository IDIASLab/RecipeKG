Keeping the story as short as I can.....40 cookies, 1/4 C butter, 1/3 C powdered sugar, a handful of walnuts, splash of vanilla.  Pulsed in a processor.  Took the advice of an earlier reviewer and baked at 350F for nine minutes.  Poured in a Meyers Lemon filling and cooked for another 30 minutes.  Maybe the best pie I've eaten and the crust was perfect.  IMHO you have to cook this crust, especially with a non-bake pie, or the crust will be mush.  I used a Marie Callender size pie tin and had more crust than I needed.  Next time I'll use 30 cookies and maybe a tad more nuts....pecans or macadamias should be awesome in this crust.  Anyway, thanks for a great idea.",
