I made very few changes (used fresh peaches instead of canned but ground ginger instead of fresh - just what I had on hand). The flavors mixed very well together and I can't imagine substituting any of them (except trying other fruits). I did add more chipotles but I'm guessing mine were not as spicy as normal because I'm VERY wimpy about spice - would have been fine as directed however. I marinated some chicken with the salsa for about three hours then baked it all for 40 minutes at 350. Came out PERFECT. Tasted good on its own as well - I'll be making this for the next cookout I attend. One thing though - prep time is definitely more than 10 minutes to chop and mince all those ingredients.",
