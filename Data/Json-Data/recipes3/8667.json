While the recipe initially called for some white bread to be pulsed in a food processor I figured there was no need to use white bread and I substituted a mixture of panko bread crumbs and Italian seasoned bread crumbs using a 2:1 ratio. This caused it to develop a crusty buttery effect - it was delicious! I also elected to use spinach instead of the arugula.",

Your finished dish can only be as good as the quality of the ingredients you use and this recipe s ingredients guarantee success. I did not butterfly the chicken breasts used a good quality Italian bread and because I had it on hand fresh baby spinach (didn t cook it) instead of arugula. I couldn t pay Hubs to eat feta so I didn t use it but I think it s a better dish without it anyway. Huge culinary pay-off for little effort. Bonus: very little clean up especially if you line your pan (I used a cookie sheet) with foil!",

I used idaho potaotes b/c that's what I had on hand nd I roasted them w/ evoo salt pepper a little garlic powder and whole cloves of garlic (LOVE roasted garlic w/ potaotes). I think I used like 7 slices of bread but I had more chicken than called for. I thought this would stick riht to the chicken but you actually have to press it on. Once baked it's beautifully golden brown and buttery delicious! I also added a little of the juice from the zested lemon to the feta 'salsa' b/c I felt that it needed it. This was our first time trying arugula and personally we weren't fans (don't know if it was the brand I bought or what) but I'll give it a try again sometime. Other than that I will def be making this dish again...It was wonderful! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I only coated the top side of the chicken to avoid any sogginess and sprinkled the remaining crumbs over the top. I used baby redskin potatoes and instead of arugula I made saut\u00e9ed spinach. I just eyeballed the ingredients for the salsa using a lot less lemon zest and oil than called for. I baked this as directed and the timing was perfect for both the potatoes and chicken.
