Instead of tomatoes and spinach we sliced red green and yellow peppers. I also omitted the fat free milk and went light on the butter. I will be making this again soon and adding shrimp to it as well.",

It needs about 1/2 tsp salt and a healthy dash of hot sauce or cayenne. IMPORTANT: regardless of how much pasta you make the sauce serves at least 8 people. My husband and I will be eating off of it all week. I like how versatile this is. I used the pasta and veggies I had on-hand. I made the sauce as written except that I used all fat-free half-and-half instead of part milk. In place of the spinach and canned tomatoes I used a chopped green pepper (cooked with the onions) and chopped fresh tomatoes. Just be warned that juice from the tomatoes makes the sauce separate a little.",

The recipe that was given, I used but added a little twist. I didn't have half and half. So I made my own which consisted of heavy cream and low-fat milk and proceed to blend the two. I also despise spinach and tomatoes so I used green peppers and lettuce. I also just used for my Italian seasoning which is rosemary, basil, garlic powder,  thyme, salt and pepper. I was disappointed that I burn my onions and use too much olive oil but it still turns out great.",
