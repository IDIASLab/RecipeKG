It also gives it a richer taste.  The other thing I do is use milk chocolate chips.  a litle secret is you can use any flavor chips you want and they all make their own flavor ie..white chocolate, or butterscotch.",

As for the chocolate, I used 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semisweet, added a tbsp of margarine and a rounded tablespoon of peanut butter. Let me tell you... the chocolate was excellent. Cutting it was no problem either. We put it into the freezer for about 15 min, then removed it to slice, and then put in the fridge to finish setting. At first we cut into large 2 inch squares, but later I cut them into smaller (1 inch) squares, which worked out better for us (see my 2 pics). They are rich, so it's perfect to have a small piece at a time. At least it worked out that way for my family:-) This is a definitaly a keeper!",
