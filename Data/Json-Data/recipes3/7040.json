The only changes I made were to use fresh minced garlic rather than the powder, plus I added about 1/2 tsp. of horseradish. Since smooth, non-lumpy mashed potatoes are a sacrilege in our house, I combined the ingredients in a bowl, plopped them on top of the hot cooked potatoes and hand mashed. This one's going in my cookbook for regular rotation. Thanks for sharing it!",
