I would say to salt to your taste. I actually didn't add any salt but I also used homemade broth and it was a little saltier than usual. Zucchini was omitted simply because something ate the ones in my garden. They weren't missed and after simmering for an hour they would have been mush anyways. This was perfect for comfort food with a bit of spice.",
