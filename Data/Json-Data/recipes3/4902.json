It was very tasty and my husband really liked it - and he doesn't like eggplant.",

I added two cups of French bread cubed 1/2 c. chicken stock 2 green onions chopped 1 celery stalk minced more garlic for taste and a fistful of chopped parsley along with doubling the Italian seasoning. I really loved this and the eggplant reminded me of my Maw Maw's oyster dressing. So I will definitely be making this again with the addition of chopped oysters.",
