The filling was the perfect consistency.  I made the cake on Friday afternoon, frosted it Friday night and refrigerated it overnight.  I took it out of the fridge around 5pm and served it at about 8pm and it was wonderful.  Also, I melted the caramels, evaporated milk and butter in a glass bowl in the microwave at 100% power for about 4 minutes, stirring after every minute or so. Thanks for a great recipe.  It's definitely a keeper!",

To quote a co-worker \"This is definitely a recipe to share\" and share it I will! Added 4/15/05: I shortcutted this recipe this time to decent results. German chocolate cake mix and made per directions. Instead of making the caramel sauce I used caramel ice cream topping. Then I used \"Pour and Frost\" icing for the cake instead of making the described icing. Decoreated and made a ring around the edges with leftover choco chips and pecans. VERY RICH but very good and gooey!",

I didn't change any ingredients but if you melt caramel mixture before backing first layer it will cool and thicken slightly while first layer bakes stopping it from pooling to the edges.
