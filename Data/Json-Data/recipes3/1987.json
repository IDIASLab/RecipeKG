However the recipe doesn't make as many as it promises -- I even scaled up to 72 servings and this produced less than 3 dozen cookies (my \"walnut sized\" lumps of dough were about a rounded teaspoon full). The dough was very quick to make in a mixer though and satisfying to work with. Thanks for this recipe!",
