Instead of shallot I used a clove of garlic; subbed sun-dried tomatoes for tomato paste; used veg broth; tripled the cilantro; and added half of a dried chipotle. I also didn't bother with the sour cream. It was pretty thick so I added veg broth till I got the right consistency. The tequila was very subtle but it definitely added flavor. This was so easy to make--a definite keeper!",

To make it how I like I doubled the cilantro and added it to straight to the soup and blended once it sits for a while it adds a nice spring time flavor. I also added about a 1/4 cup heavy cream garlic salt instead of regular and about 2 TBS lemon juice. Making these additions saved the soup. I will use this as my base recipe and keep playing around with it. Next time I may try adding some cucumbers.",
