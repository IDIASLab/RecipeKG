I suggest more oil in the bottom of the pan (I have stainless steel and it kept sticking).

                "reviewBody": "We liked the flavor of this dish but I suggest that you double cumin and mustard seeds because the spice flavor is a little subtle. The coconut gives an extra kick and makes the flavor a little unusual. As the previous reviewer I think it is not necessary to put beets and potatoes in the water because when you put the vegetables to the skillet the mixture splutters very much. If necessary add water when you simmer the vegetables. I think that the cooking time is a little wrong here because if you put beets along with potatoes you will get overcooked potatoes and uncooked beets. So I suggest that you cut beets thiner than potatoes fry and simmer it a little first then add potatoes. Overall this is a good and cheap meal and a tasty way to eat more beets.",
