Ground beef/hamburger does NOT impart the same flavour and this mixutre gives the sauce a richer flavour. Rather than dried basil, throw in a handful of fresh basil about 30 minutes before the sauce is finished with fresh garlic and red wine. This I learned while attending an Italian cooking class.  ",
