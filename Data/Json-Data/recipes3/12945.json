Be careful simmering the sauce i had to end up covering the pan because the sauce boils easily and splashes out of the pan. Enjoy guys! I am making this recipe again tonight!!",

I did mix in the red pepper flakes to the marinara rather than garnishing with it at the end and then warmed the meatballs in the sauce. These buns hold together very very well (no breaking apart as often can happen on a regular hot dog bun or even a hoagie roll). However they re big and thick and unless toasted pretty well can be doughy. Guess I made my meatballs a bit smaller because I ended up with three to a sub. and that was plenty for me. Enjoyed!",
