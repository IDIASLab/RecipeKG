The taste was awesome. Added just a dash of salt and pepper. As an aside it was kind of funny. I make all my spaghetti sauce. When my husband saw the spaghetti sauce packages he was confused. He had never saw me use actual seasoning packages. I always do this on my own. The seasoning packages were great and added a really nice flavor to the sauce! Try it! Thanks for the recipe!",

Then let it simmer more and add one more can of water (with the tomato paste can) after 10 minutes. I am starting to make this recipe again for this evening and cannot wait until it is completed!",
