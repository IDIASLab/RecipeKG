The seasonings are perfect as is and the cook time is spot on. I used medium to large size thighs and everything was perfectly cooked after 35 minutes.  I'm a little confused how some are having issues??? If you cut the veggies the proper size, use the right size pan (not too big, not too small) and follow the directions exactly, this makes an amazing dinner! I loved the smoky flavors from the bacon and paprika. I'm glad I have leftovers for a few more meals!",
