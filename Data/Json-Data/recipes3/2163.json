Reading other reviews I simply used unsweetened flaked coconut and added a little water once the shrimp were added to the pan (to make up for the moisture loss of using dried coconut). Very quick and tasty. I served it with Indian side dishes. My husband finished his plate and exclaimed \"that was great, time to lick the plate, good!\" This is so not my man, to give you an idea of just how good this dish is. Thank you for sharing this dish. This will take the place of my Korma as the star of my Indian dinners.",
