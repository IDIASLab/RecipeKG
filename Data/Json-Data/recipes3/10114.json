I used a package of Hillshire Farms roast beef and a package of shredded Parmesan-Reggiano cheese. The only step I would change is when adding the flour which is needed to thicken the soup up. I seasoned the flour first with pepper and garlic powder. My mistake was adding all the flour at once (I had to whisk the soup like crazy to dissolve the flour clumps that formed). I would save a 1/2 cup of milk and whisk the flour into that and then add it to the soup. I cooked the soup on high for 5 hours and added the cheese/flour 1 3/4 of an hour before the soup was done.",

The chef was kind enough to write out the recipe by hand and it\u2019s been a favorite of my family ever since.  The recipe that I was given is exactly the same as this one.

As is --great base--loved all the stuff that was put it but seemed to lack flavor---did not have a \"beef\" flavor at all---seemed like all i tasted was cheese.
