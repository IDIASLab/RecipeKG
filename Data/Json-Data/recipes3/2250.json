To change, I used cooked orzo pasta instead of rice and replaced the seafood with chicken.  Note though, the orzo soaked up a LOT of the liquid and got so big and fat that the soup turned into a stew.  Still very yummy though!  Oh, and I also added a splash of white wine to the veggies when sauteing them, as I always seem to have some leftover wine in the fridge.  It gives the finished product a nice depth.",
