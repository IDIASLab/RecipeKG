I accidently used 1/3 cup of sugar rather than the 1/4 called for and I could have handled the lesser sugar (I'll be more careful next time).  My store was out of chocolate cookie crusts, so I used a pre-made shortbread crust and I loved the contrast.  I topped the whole pie with Easy Devonshire Cream from this site and shaved chocolate.  My only problem is that I at the last piece last night and I don't have enough cream to make another right now ;).  Thank you for my new \"Go-To\" chocolate fix!",

I made the mistake of using plain whipping cream (not heavy) and thought it was going to be like soup, but once chilled it was very puddingy. I put it in a shortbread pre-made crust and topped it with whip cream to cut the chocolate a bit. I also added about 1-2 tablespoons more sugar. It was great! I think I may try it next time with milk chocolate chips. Thanks!",
