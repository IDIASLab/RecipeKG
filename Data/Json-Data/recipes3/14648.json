The only changes I made were: 1) used my own salt free sazon blend instead of store bought and ended up adding a little extra adobo and 2) used gluten free beer (tested with Omission and Two Brothers) and had no issues with the recipe. This is our new go to recipe for skirt steak tacos and look forward to making it again!",
