Couldn\u2019t work with it like in the video.  Did not have anymore chicken broth so I added enough flour to make it workable.  When I tried to make the bowls with the dough, that was a disaster as well...so, I mixed the dough and chicken together, used an ice cream scoop to make the balls and finished with egg and breadcrumbs.\nAir fried them and they were Delicious.  Just like Banquet used to make in the 70\u2019s.  Added cream of chicken soup with half a can of milk as gravy.",
