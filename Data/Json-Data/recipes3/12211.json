A little more red pepper than called for and I sauteed the zoodles separately before adding them to the sauce. I added Parmesan cheese at the end when plated. The result, was amazing. We were not convinced as we were cooking it that it was going to be any good. Boy were we wrong!! This one is going on the rotation for sure.",
