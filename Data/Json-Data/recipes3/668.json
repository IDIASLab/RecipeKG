I too added 2Tbs sugar to crumbs and melted butter mixture and firmly pressed into pan. I   noted that when I went to cut, the crust started to crumb.  I placed the pan in the frig and it firmed up and was easy cutting and it all stayed together perfectly.  Plus, these are great right out of the fridge.  These are soooo yummy and could not be easier and very addictive.  The only thing I would change for next time is making it equal parts chocolate and PB chips b/c the PB chips can get lost in the flavor.  This would be great with ANY combination of chips or toppings ie. butterscotch, heath bars, etc. And, they are so rich, a small pan goes a long way b/c you can cut these in tiny bars - that way one could have a taste and not feel overwhelmed by the sweetness if so inclined.  I got raves, plus, these freeze well - I had made these in a double batch 15\" pan and now have for stop-in guests!  BRAVO and thanks so much.",
