I substituted nondairy yogurt for real yogurt and talapia for the halibut and it still tasted delicious.  I didn't have a grill so I made a large foil packet, sealed it well, placed it in a baking dish and baked it at 350 until the fish was flakey.  I also skipped the tortilla strips and used taco bowls instead. I will definitely be making this again.",

I did the halibut in the foil packs however I baked mine as opposed to grilling them. In addition instead of placing a whole piece of halibut on top I opted to flake it all over the salad. I found this to be better as the fish was everywhere but really it is a matter of personal choice. Otherwise the ingredients as listed were perfect. If you like more garlic add it in. I had two big garlic in it and that was plenty. If you plan on flaking it as I did you may not need as much halibut as noted. The avocado dressing was excellent.",
