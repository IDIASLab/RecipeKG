The texture wasn't quite the same as with cheese, but it wasn't unappealing or weird like some vegan recipes.  I think the nutritional yeast really gives it a earthy yet cheese like flavor, infinitely better than \"Vegan Cheese\"\n\nAnyway, added a diced Jalapeno with the black beans, also added 1-1 1/4 cup clack beans instead of 1/2 cup. I should of added the whole can though, wouldn't of hurt anything.\n\nWill surely make this again!",
