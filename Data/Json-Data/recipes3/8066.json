I wanted a creamier version of tzatziki. I put it on a tortilla with shredded chicken, cheddar, green leaf lettuce and lots of tomatoes and feta. It was sooo good I was eating it by the spoonful! You can play around with adding a little more mayo or sour cream, as my measurements may not have been exact.",

I've been searching for a long time to find a recipe for the cucumber sauce that is almost spot on to what I grew up on...I finally found it!...I recently grilled a beef brisket that I had rubbed in Greek seasoning to marinate all day. I had no idea what to do with leftovers and Gyros popped in my head. I finally found this recipe which I was sure might not be right. I read the other reviews and decided to try it...OMG!...I am in heaven!!...Only thing I did different was add a teaspoon of dried dill and that sealed the deal. I might not add the mayo next time and maybe add more sour cream in place of the mayo. Mayo didn't do much for me....I am so Happy to have found this recipe even if it's not the real thing. Sure tastes like it. I'm addicted now and I find myself adding it to everything.",

The addition of dill is a necessity. I used a paper towel to strain the cucumber and then I squeezed some of the juice back into the mixture because the towel certainly soaks up a majority. Added a dash of garlic powder, onion powder, lemon juice and olive oil. It had a strong yogurt odor so I was afraid the taste would lack, but boy was I wrong! I do recommend refrigerating several hours prior to serving in order for the minced garlic to permeate the yogurt. FYI- it will appear curdled even though it is not. This is due to the cucumber being processed. For a more aesthetically pleasing sauce, shred the cucumber with a cheese grater. Fabulous find, thank you!",

I also used fat free yogurt that I drained using a strainer and a coffee filter. It's a great way to pinch a few pennies and calories off of this great sauce. This is excellent paired up with pepperocini beef (on this site). I changed that recipe by piercing a london broil and sticking sliced garlic inside. I also rubbed with Cavender's and let it sit overnight before cooking. btw- the sauce is sooo much better when you allow it to sit overnight. So prepare the sauce when you rub the broil and start the crockpot first thing in the morning. It is worth every minute of prep. Speaking of prep... I couldn't find the lid of my food processor so I just chopped the cucumber as fine as possible. I think I like the texture more than when I used the FP.",
