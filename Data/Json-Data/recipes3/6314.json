My oven was already going at 350 degrees so I used that temperature and baked these for only about 15 minutes. I just wanted to warm them through and didn t want them turning to mush. These were very good but probably would have been a little better with the kalamata olives. I ll use those next time. I also toasted my pinenuts in the oven at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes until golden. I think that s easier and you don t have to stir constantly for 3-4 minutes as indicated in the recipe. I ll make this again!",
