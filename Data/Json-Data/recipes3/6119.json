The anise flavor tones down as the fennel cooks and the wine honey and mustard seed make a marvelous sauce. I cooked the dish a little hotter than suggested (I was in a hurry) and the fennel sort of caramelized on the bottom of the pan. De-lish! Hubby and I ate most of it with dinner last night and I had the rest for breakfast this morning. We'll definitely be making it again! The only down side... I now have a pile of fennel tops that I don't know what to do with. Guess it's time for more research!",
