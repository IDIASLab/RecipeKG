Or maybe it just depends on what kind of steps you hate to do. (Me I hate peeling and chopping stuff up.) I original put a 4 on this made it again and didn't like it as well but also admit I didn't beat the egg whites very well the second time so apparently that's important. I liked it but do agree there's not much to it and I felt it necessary to eat 2 so more like 3 servings if you ask me. Something a little different anyway.",

If the recipe sounded good to you then try it. I read all the other reviews after I had eaten this and can't believe them. The flavours are nice and delicate yet spicy. Method is pretty straightforward even though I would toast the bread on both sides the next time. Adjust the cayenne for your audience I even made one extra spicy batch for the adults. I left out the salt and butter. Thank you for the recipe.",
