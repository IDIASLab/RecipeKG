Heat the cream and butter as directed and pour it over the chocolate and zest. Cover and let sit for 10 minutes then stir. Add the liquor last. Let the mixture sit in the fridge overnight... it will be more firm and have better orange flavor the next day. I would not recommend adding oil to the chocolate used for coating as it slows it from hardening. Also do not be tempted to freeze the filling... the chocolate shell will crack if the filling is frozen!",

I had trouble getting my filling to get firm enough.  Even after 2+ hours of chilling it wasn't firm enough to roll.  So I scooped out the size balls I wanted onto a lined cookie sheet, then placed them in the FREEZER for 30 minutes, then I rolled them into balls, and \"froze\" for another 15 minutes longer before rolling them in the cooled chocolate coating.",

I followed the recipe exactly and these truffles came out very well. But you must be sure to refrigerate the chocolate for at least 2 hours then again after scooping and after rolling. That makes a huge difference in the end result. My only complaint was that I found the chocolates needed more sugar and a stronger flavor. The liquier just couldn't compete with the strength of the semi-sweet chocolate. ADDITIONAL NOTE: You must keep these refrigerated. If they get to room temperature the ganache melts.",

Here are some things I did to alter it that work wonderfully: 1. Get the most use out of the orange you bought by zesting 1 teaspoon like the recipe calls for and additionally peeling a little more than a dozen flakes with the peeler to use as decoration at the end. Instead of using liqueur I used juice from the orange reserving what's left for the decoration at the end as well. 2. Add at least an extra tablespoon of orange juice to the filling maybe even 1 1/2 like I did. It makes them more orangey. 3. I added a little under 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the filling. It helps with the bitter flavor and makes it sweet. 4. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil for the chocolate coating this works well. 5. After I dipped all the filling in chocolate I re-heated the remaining chocolate and added 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and 2-3 tblspns of orange juice (I should have used the leftover juice but I accidentally threw it out.) I dipped my fork in to the mixture once it was mixed smooth and drizzled it over the top of the truffles. In the drizzle on top of each one I placed an orange zest flake set aside form the beginning. They turned out magnificently.",
