Without using 4 lemons I went with my instinct and used only 2 lemons and 1 cup of orange juice along with 3-4 tablspoons of raw honey to take away some of the bitterness that the lemons gave. Although the lemons work as a great tenderizer for the turkey it would've overpowered all of the fresh herbs that I diced and that would've been a waste. I also added 1/4 cup of diced fresh rosemary which set it off to perfection. I used all of the drippings to make gravy and everyone said it was the best gravy they ever had! The turkey was very tender and had a great flavor to it.",
