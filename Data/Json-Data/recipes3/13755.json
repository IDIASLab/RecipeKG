Two things stand out for me: it took longer than 5 minutes to brown the flour and butter; getting it brown is crucial to the end colour of the gravy. Secondly next time I'd just add a drop or two at a time of the Worcestershire sauce at a time tasting as I go - the taste of it was too strong for me in the end product.",
