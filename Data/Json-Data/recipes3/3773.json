Since the demi-glace I used was very concentrated and thick, I loosened it up with some chicken broth. Exquisite, a real prize.",

(When rehydrating the mushrooms I added red wine and a little coarse Kosher salt to the warm water and saved the resulting liquor for another use.) Of course I did tweak the recipe a little to my own taste as we all do. I used green onions (didn't have any shallots) and added one small clove of garlic finely minced. Also demi-glace is not a current staple in my kitchen so I used beef broth and more wine along with a pinch of nutmeg and liberal freshly ground mixed pepper. Since I was working with rehydrated dried mushrooms I was not concerned that any spices would overcome as drying intensifies the flavour of wild mushrooms. The sauce reduced nicely with a longer cooking time and I did follow a previous suggestion and mixed a VERY small amount of brown gravy mix in some water and added it at the last minute. Served with rare/med rare NY Strip steaks this was a gourmet treat. I WILL be making this again!!",

We were looking for a Ragout of Wild Mushrooms in Puff Pastry as served by Cole's Chop House in Napa. We took this recipe and used it as a base then we tweeked it to a Napa standard(i.e. we reduced about 400 ml of BV Coastal Estates Zinfandel to a loose glace). Shallot is so underated but here they really shine through. For our mushroom selections we used some fresh choices Oyster and Portobello. Then we added dried mushrooms Morel and Chanterelle. I think the added reduction really punched up the favors... there's nothing subtile here! Serve this in a puff pastry cup along side a robustly seasoned (Montreal spices) rib eye steak.",
