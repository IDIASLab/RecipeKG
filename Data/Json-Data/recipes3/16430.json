My children like raw spinach not cooked so I did the OBVIOUS adding it to a 1/4 of the caserole dish (using 1/4 spinach called for as well). I used my own meat sauce which also included sausage and that was a great addition. This was an easy alternative to lasagna and I didn't have to hear 1 single complaint. I think that the 8 oz. box of pasta is a mistake I normally use 16 oz. and it feeds the 4 of us the baby (I have what my husband would have eaten left over as he is out of town on business again ). I will use this again thanks Jo!!",

Why on earth if you don't like cooked spinach would you choose a recipe with cooked spinach as the main ingredient then give it one star for having cooked spinach?? Think about it.",
