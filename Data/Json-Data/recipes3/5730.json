I think the egg \"helped\" them stick to the grill. I did use really lean meat..maybe that was the culprit although hubby swears it was thawing the meat in the microwave ( he says it makes the meat watery which inhibits it from holding together). Flavorwise these were all right...the jalapeno didn't add as much as I had anticipated though. For us this was at best 3 stars but I am giving four since I know somehow it has to be hubby's fault.",

I added some finely chopped cilantro and left the seeds of 2 out of 6 jalapenos in just because I love spicy food. If you're not a fan of Swiss Cheese like me just add your favorite instead. I used Cooper Sharp cheese. Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing!",
