The only thing I did change is that I added an extra tablespoon of flower. After mixing in the Pesto I felt that the sauce was still too thin and I didn't think it would stick well to the pasta. After I added the flower I let it simmer for an extra 5 minutes and it was perfect. Adding the pasta helped too because the starch from the pasta made it a bit less liquidy as well. Great recipe!",

I followed the recipe with the following modifications: I chopped the garlic rather than slice it I cut the butter (Earth Balance Buttery Sticks) to 1/4 cup and stirred the flour into the oil/onions/garlic/butter (making a roux) before adding 2 cups Silk brand plain soy milk. I used Pecorino Romano cheese (sheeps' milk we can tolerate that well) and used prepared pesto made with the same. My family raved (even the picky 9-year old). This is definitely a keeper and now I know it works with soy milk I will probably make different flavored variations of the cream sauce.",
