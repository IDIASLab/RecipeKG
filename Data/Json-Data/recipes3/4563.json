Something was off but I culdn't figure out what. Maybe the condensed soup taste? The celery? I'm not sure what wasn't right exactly. These had no tang no zip no spice no taste basically. I simmered this for an hour so the flavor could have time to develop. Sorry to give such a poor review these are edible but I will not be looking forward to finishing what is left. With all the high ratings I expected more but maybe it's just me since other reviewers seemed to be pleased with this recipe. I'm glad I cut this in half! Thanks anyway I enjoyed trying a new recipe. Cooking is such a grand adventure!",
