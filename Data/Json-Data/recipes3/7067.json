I used regular table salt and I don't know if this had any affect on the tenderness of the meat. I like more gravy so I used a 14oz can of beef broth(minus what I used for the marinade). In step four after I put the remainder of the marinade into the pan I added the beef broth. I used Wondra gravy flour and thicken to taste. I served this over buttered noodles. Overall a very good recipe that I will use again.",
