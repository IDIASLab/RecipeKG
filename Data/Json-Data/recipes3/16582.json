Instead of using surimi I substituted sliced pieces of ham. I also roasted the red pepper myself which took almost no time at all. Also tried cutting the fat a bit by using 1/3 cup cream and 1/3 cup milk. The baking time of the actual quiche took longer than 20 min but it was worth the wait. I'll probably start using this as my main quiche recipe. Thanks!",

I'll bet it would be even better with the crab meat! I love the zip that the hot sauce gives to the recipe!

I baked the quiche for 30 minutes and let it sit in the oven for 20 and it was perfectly done! Very easy to prep too! Recommend!",
