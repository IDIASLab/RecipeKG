Right after I put the Prime Rib in the oven, I whip this up in the blender and refrigerate.  When the Prune Rib comes out, I put a muffin pan for 12 with 1/4 tsp of the drippings (try using lard or even bacon drippings if you didn't collect any from the roast - real fat makes a huge difference in flavor).  Heat the muffin pan as you raise the temp. in the oven, then take the batter straight from the fridge and pour into the hot fat.  Huge puffy Yorkshires come out 20 minutes later.",
