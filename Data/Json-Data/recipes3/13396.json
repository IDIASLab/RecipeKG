I figured it was going to be easier to let them finish cooking with the sauce getting thickened. It was a good choice. I think you need to season the chicken more than just that little bit of garlic powder so I used my favorite seasoning from this site: Papa's Seasoning (I use it on everything!). I made some jasmine rice which was a perfect accompaniment to the sauce. I'm so grateful to be able to have leftovers for tomorrow night! Thanks for this recipe! It was yummy!",
