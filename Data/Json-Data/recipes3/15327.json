Unlike some tropical fruit marinades, kiwi doesn't turn the meat into mush, and provides a nice, slightly sweet and acidic base for our ancho chili rub. Finish with a sprinkling of green onions and a side of barbecue sauce and potato salad.",

Marinated the meat in refrigerator overnight but something can up and was not able to cook until the next day. Even after 48 hrs. of marination the meat was not mushy but a little too tenderized for me. So even with Kiwi fruit the max marinate time should only be 24 hrs. Grilled over charcoal and came out deliciously!",
