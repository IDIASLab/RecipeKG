I have a 1000-watt microwave, so on the first go-round (with the butter and oil) I reduced it as said to 70% power, however the mixture of butter and oil sounded like explosives in my microwave after only a few seconds. It made a great deal of mess, even after I added a saran-wrap cover to the top of the dish. After adding the rice, I reduced the power to 50%, and cooked as directed which seemed to do the trick. I continued at 50% power for the rest of the cooktime and it did end up turning out a prety quick and really tasty dish, something my whole family (of non-rice eaters) enjoyed.",
