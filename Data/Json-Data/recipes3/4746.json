Add seasoning as you grind. When done mix with eggs and flour. THEN make snowball size balls. Boil a little longer after they rise. One layer per bowl. Best with sauer braten but also good with rouladen though I cheat and add vinegar to my part of the gravy. About two large yellow onions worth of onions. No bread or crumbs. Just grind pieces as you grind the potatoes turning bowl as it comes out of the grinder to dispurse evenly.",
