I ended up using some Walla Walla sweet onions and it turned out great!  \n\nOne tip... rather than drudging the onion before dipping it, I just threw my sliced onions in a gallon size bag with the flour and gave them all a good shake at the same time, it really cut down the mess.",

No leftovers it all went fast and now they are having me make more this week! Update I made them again with Newcastle Nut Brown Ale and you could taste the beer more it had a deeper flavor.
