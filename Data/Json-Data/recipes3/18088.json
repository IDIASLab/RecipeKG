Using the Instant Pot just to cook just the rice doesn't really save any time, so I saut\u00e9d the sausage and chicken with some garlic in the pot for about 5 minutes first, then turned it off and added the rice and chicken broth. I used 2 cups of broth instead of 1. Then on top of that I added all the other ingredients and spices, including one chopped jalape\u00f1o, and I put the shrimp in frozen. Mix it all together and set the Instant Pot to cook for 8 minutes, then release the pressure using the release valve. Everything was cooked perfectly.",
