So added some paprika, basil, oregano, thyme, garlic powder and some red pepper flakes. I used my frozen green beans which were a little watery as opposed to store green beans so I ended up cooking them a little longer. I think the butter is unneeded in this dish with all the bacon in it. Unless you use just a couple of Tbsp and saute the onions, peppers, and garlic first, then add the beans and bacon. The bacon also could be cut in half. Had a good flavor, wasn't too spicy for us. I will probably make again. Thanks for the recipe.",

And in our case I omitted it altogether. I saut\u00e9ed the bacon then added red and yellow bell pepper (rather than green) for color then the garlic. Once that was cooked and seasoned I added the cooked French-style green beans. I used half the amount of bacon called for and it was plenty.
