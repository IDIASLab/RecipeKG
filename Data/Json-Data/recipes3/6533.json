First I rubbed the chops down with olive oil prior to placing it in the flour mixture and I used kosher salt throughout the recipe. Secondly I added shallots while searing the pork and added chopped apple when it was time to simmer. The apples and shallots really made the sauce. Lastly I had no cream on hand so I used 1% milk and the sauce was amazing and still very rich. I think cream would of been too heavy. Served with mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce. Fantastic!",

I think next time I will leave out the breading part as it just made a mess in the sauce for me. I also added some diced apples to the pan before I cooked the chops.
