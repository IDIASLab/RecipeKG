Mine said that I would need 1/2 cup oil (which I used), 3 eggs (same as this recipe), and 1 1/4 cups water.  So, I mashed 3 bananas, poured them into a measuring cup, and then filled up with water to make the 1 1/4 cups.  Otherwise, I think it would have been a little dry.   \nI also poured in about 1 cup of mini choc chips, and then made it into 22 muffins rather than a cake. They took 19 minutes to bake in my oven.  No icing needed.  They were light and airy, but just moist enough.  Delicious! ",

My son and I decided to follow the measurements and ingredient list on the box of Betty Crocker Chocolate Cake mix then add 1 Cup of mashed very ripe bananas. I still had two small bananas left over so we mixed those in too and baked in a bundt pan. We left it the oven for 15 minutes longer than the box recommended. The result was a very moist delicious cake. We were glad we had added the extra bananas as the bananas flavor was still subtle. We had planned to ice the cake but decided against it after tasting the cake. A little sprinkled powdered-sugar adds just enough sweetness. Everyone in the family loves this new cake. We will try it with different flavors of cake mix. Hope this helps other confused readers.",
