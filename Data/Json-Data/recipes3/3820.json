I added a small can of chopped mushrooms, and a 1/2 can of cream of muchroom soup. You can use more of the soup if you like but it may make the consistency thinner. I also used a box(2packages)of the herb and butter flavored instant potatoes instead of boiling the 6 large. I also added the pretty hefty layer of Velveeta after the first layering of the meat and potatoes, and finished the dish with shredded cheddar cheese then baked until the cheese was golden brown. Will definitely make again.\r\n\r\nLaurie H.",

One in our family can't have cheese, so I made a nice serving of gravy from the drippings and spooned plenty over the meat layers.  I used 1 lb. each hamburger and sausage, and added a few cloves garlic, 1 T. sage and a couple shakes of Tony's (creole seasoning) while browning meat.  With these additions, I had no problems with flavor!  There are so many variations you could make of this (adding veggies, soups, sour cream?) - I'll definitely make it again!",

I used only 1 1/4 lb. of ground beef and 4 large baked potatoes (peeled and chopped), and it fit perfectly in a 9x13 casserole dish.  I also spiced up the meat, onion, bell pepper mixture with about 1 tsp. of worchestershire sauce and some steak seasoning, as well as sliced baby portabella mushrooms.  I also made garlic mashed potatoes instead of just regular mashed potatoes.  And I also did as other suggested and added cheese.  I made two layers each of beef mixture, mashed potato mixture and then shredded cheddar cheese.\r\n\r\nThanks for the recipe!  Will certainly make again.",

The first time didn't turn out to well because I didn't use enough ground beef and cheese but had too many potatos.::chuckling:: The second time I used 2 1/2 pounds of ground beef and alot more cheese. (Like it was suggested I put a layer of cheese after the first layer of meat and potatos.) The two layers of cheese is amazing. Be careful with the green pepper. The more it is cooked the more \"water\" it will produce. I would suggest using 1/2 the green pepper and dicing it up. Then again I'm not the best cook so I'm sure there are others that know of different thickening agents to use. Overall....it's incredibly tasty and will be used many times in the Bachelor's life.:-)",
