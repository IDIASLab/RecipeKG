Knowing that I made additional roux so the soup was super thick (the way we like chowder) before the scallops and potatoes even went in. Only did a couple things differently. I had no vegetable broth on hand so I used chicken and it was fine. These were \"small\" bay scallops not sea scallops and I could not see the need to cut them into smaller pieces. Honestly I wouldn t dedicate the time to do that with a pound of bay scallops ever (too labor intensive). This turned out well and I wouldn t hesitate to serve this for a company dinner especially an appetizer portion. Bekka thanks for sharing your recipe.",

I did not use the cayenne, because of intolerance to hot spices. I also used baby bellas and it worked just fine. I changed the procedure a little bit though. I cooked all the veggies but the potatoes. Then, removed them from the pot and added a bit of the butter and sauteed the potatoes. Removed them and proceeded with the rest of the recipe adding the potatoes after the liquid was added. Followed the rest of the recipe and added the scallops as per the recipe. I made sure my scallops were actually cooked. Not chewy but with a tiny bit of consistency. I also removed the foamy top as it boiled. Still, it is a warming very restaurant level soup.
