I do this with all the recipes I rate to be fair, but I liked it even better the second time I made it. The second time I made it I seasoned the chicken with the spices and browned the thighs in light tasting olive oil with onion slices, then added the tomatoes. Simmered for 45 minutes, then added a splash of white wine, lime juice and fresh cilantro and cooked a minute or 2 longer when wine was cooked down. I Served it over white rice. Will definitely make again and again and use more tomatoes.\nUpdate 7/17/17, I made this for the  first time in a while. I never make anything the same way twice lol, this time I did not add wine, lime or cilantro (because I didn't have any). Instead, I added a little chicken broth and curry powder and topped it with sour cream before eating it. I was hungry for a curry dish and this was fabulous!! I still seasoned and browned the chicken with sliced onions first, then added tomatoes and chicken broth and simmered. Yummy!! Great base tomato chicken recipe!!!",

I did make a few changes in the end (I know people hate when you change a recipe- but this was really adaptable and I only made a few changes after tasting the final product)...I didn't have chili powder so I added some chili flakes instead. I didnt have ginger, so I skipped it. I used boneless skinless thighs and browned them in the coconut oil but with the tomatoes and spices in the beginning. Once it was done and I tasted it I added a tblsp. of sugar and a tblsp. of curry powder and a dash of salt. Adding these few  ingredients really brought everything together, but it would have been great without. While browning the chicken I also added a chopped onion and some sliced mushrooms I had in the fridge. I called it 'Indian chicken and tomato stew' and served it over rice. I served it to company and everyone raved and even wanted the recipe. I will be making this again. It was delicious! This is a definite keeper!",

I did make a few changes, mostly because I did not have the exact ingredients avail.  I used chicken breasts, but did not thin them out.  I pan seared them, first, in order to speed the cooking process.  Since I didn't have fresh spices, I used the dried equivalent.  The last thing I switched, was using diced tomatoes (28 oz), as I didn't have any fresh.  All of this helped to speed the cooking, to about 30 mins, vice the 45.  My husband, who has taste issues, said that he liked this very much!",

Made in the electric pressure cooker putting onion garlic and chicken in after saut\u00e9ing and deglazing pot with about 1/2 c chicken broth. Put tomatoes on very top to avoid scorching. Also saut\u00e9ed the seasonings. Cooked on high pressure for 10 min with 10 min NPR. Will definitely make again. Thank you very much for the recipe.",
