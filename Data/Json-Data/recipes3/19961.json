So it's important to know that the dough may not be easily workable, but if that is the case just make a bar cookie instead of the individual cookies.  The following cake mixes worked well: (just remember to refrigrate over night) -Lemon Cake Mix (nice dough)(use lemon extract instead of vanilla) and if you would like make a lemon glaze and drizzle over cookie when cooled.  (These got a lot of rave reviews when I made them). - Cherry Chip cake mix (nice dough) got rave reviews, devils food cake mix (sticky dough)good taste, german chocolate (nice dough), Carmel cake mix (forget it, very sticky dough- is workable to some degree you just wont get as many cookies. Next I want try carrot cake mix, strawberry cake mix, and spice cake mix.  \nI did discover that it's better to refrigrate over night and use a small cookie scoop,  My scoop is big so once I scoop a cookie out of the dough I cut it in half, roll it and then shake it in a baggy with powdered sugar.   In my oven 12 min. exact is the cooking time any longer these cookies get a crispy burnt bottom.\nI hope everyone enjoys trying these other cake mixes as well as my family, neighbors and friends have.\n:)\n(update)  Strawberry cake was pretty good.  But our newest favorite rave review cake choice is Orange. I just made lemon cookies and orange cookies for a church social and then again ",

I made them for a bake sale, and although they appeared kind of plain at first, once people tasted them, they came back for more! I cannot wait to try this recipe with different flavors of cake mix next time. If you are lucky enough to have any left, they taste even better a few hours after they come out of the oven. One warning, though: It may seem as though the baking time may be off, but DO NOT OVERBAKE. It is just about right. The cookies will continue to cook a bit once they are out of the oven. They are soft and just melt in your mouth. The last thing you want is a burned cookie. Definitely try this one. Mmm mmm good.",

If it wasn\u2019t for that necessity I don\u2019t know that I would have actively chosen this recipe, which in the end happily proved to be one of those \u201cfinds.\u201d  The dough is difficult to work with because it\u2019s sticky and mushy and gooey.  The cookie isn\u2019t gooey, as its title describes, but the dough sure is.  If I wasn\u2019t so impatient I would have chilled it until good and firm, but who knows \u2013 maybe it would have made this a different cookie.  I used a French Vanilla cake mix, the flavor of which I believe is far superior to either a white or yellow cake mix (but especially the yellow).  I had recently purchased raspberry baking tidbits from Amazon.com and knew this would be a good time to use them \u2013 I added just shy of a cup.  Because the dough was so soft it was kind of a pain to roll the little mush balls in the powdered sugar, and in hindsight I wouldn\u2019t bother with that step because you couldn\u2019t really see it on the finished cookie anyway. Needless to say, with a stick of butter and an 8-ounce package of cream cheese, these are very rich, soft cookies, but oh are they good, particularly, I think, because of the addition of the raspberry baking tidbits - not sure I\u2019d like these just plain.  I think mini chocolate chips as well as any number of other additions would also work well in this cookie.",

First batch was rolled in 10x sugar before baking and it didn't leave much on the cookie out of the oven so the rest I just rolled in sugar after out of the oven, and did some with holiday sprinkles before baking. So buttery, rich, and love the texture. almost tastes like a rich cheesecake. They stay nice and soft too. thanks for this very versatile recipe with lots of combinations of cake mixes and additions of nuts, chips, etc.",
