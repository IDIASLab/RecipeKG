Not sure. But I didn't miss the crunch at all. The seasonings were so great with these beans it didn't matter. This is absolutely going to be on the dinner menu at this house at least once a week from now on. I used Great Northern White Beans but think it would be good with just about any mild flavored bean. I cannot recommend these enough. Thanks Amanda!",
