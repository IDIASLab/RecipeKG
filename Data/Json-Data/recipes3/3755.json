Instead of sauteing the squash in butter I cooked one slice of bacon in a non-stick pan first and then sauteed the squash in the bacon drippings. I also added a big pinch of ground thyme to the squash mixture. Instead of cooking the ground beef with jalapenos I stirred in a drained can of Rotel tomatoes after I mixed in the eggs and mayonaise. It was GREAT! Even my husband who does not like squash loved the casserole! (of course I didn't tell him it was in there!)",
