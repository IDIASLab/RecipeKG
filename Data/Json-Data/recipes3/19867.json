I didn't know!)it was REALLY good! I didn't have bay leaves and it didn't suffer because of it. I used a little less breadcrumbs and more ground beef and garlic. I didn't find it too spicy as other reviewers had commented. It was a little greasy but I just poured the oil off when it was cooked. Leaving it to stand for 15 minutes was definitely good advice. I will be making this again!",

Wait until the next day and it just gets better for sandwiches.\r\n\r\nToo spicy for kids, however.",

My children love this. My 1 year old ate 3 helpings! I'll make this one often.",

We served it with a simple green salad with tomatoes and balsamic dressing -- anything heavier (potatoes bread even brocolli) might have been too much. For the other novice cooks attempting this -- the hot pepper sauce I used was Cholula but you can use tobasco too. We chopped the vegies into small chunks -- not so fine that you'd use a food processor but not too chunky either. This way the flavors blend together and you won't bite into a big piece of pepper or something. When we pulled it out of the oven the grease had pooled to the sides which you can just pour off. We let it stand for about 15 min before serving. Perfect time to make a salad and set the table! We will definitely make again and are looking forward to the cold meatloaf for lunch today!",
