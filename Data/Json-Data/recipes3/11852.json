I always sub Hillshire Farm Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage in any recipe that calls for smoked sausage and it was delicious in this pie. The only addition I made was adding a few red pepper flakes and some freshly-ground pepper. The pie filling was the perfect texture moist but not runny exactly the way a pot pie should be. Nothing fancy here comfort food for sure but baking them in the individual pie pans also added some eye appeal and just a bit more interest. Served with some freshly-cooked apples. Nice and easy recipe.",
