I find generic to be the best.  I use a 2c. bag of sharp cheddar in place of the american cheese; any cheese will work, but we prefer the sharper flavor.  I too cut back on butter, it's just not necessary.  I nuke the potatoes for about 10 minutes alone or thaw them in the fridge overnight for a creamier consistency.  For brunches, I use O'Brien potatoes (hash browns with the potatoes and onions and peppers already added), use cream of potato instead of chicken and add a pkg of precooked bacon crumbled up.  Yum, people rave over that for breakfast!",

I use the shredded hash browns and don't even have to bother with thawing them. I also use onion powder as opposed to chopped onions because some people in my family don't like onions but that way I can still get the flavor. You can also find boxes of cornflake crumbs that save you from having to do it yourself....I always keep one on hand and I use it for other things as well. I also don't use the butter as other people have stated but I do use 16 oz of sour cream and a 2 c bag of cheddar. For a little bit better topping I add more shredded cheese to the cornflake crumbs (some melted butter can be added to the crumbs and it would probably be best but I usually don't bother). However one tip to this recipe....cover the casserole with with foil for the first 30 minutes or so of cooking. Uncover and then add your crumbs (and cheese if desired) and bake uncovered for another 15-20 minutes or so. I wouldn't bake it with the crumb topping for the entire time.",
