I also amped up the spies by adding pepper flakes, chili powder, onion salt, garlic powder, and salt/black pepper. That flavor profile really gave the chicken some character. I also had to keep the chicken in an additional 15 minutes on the front end and 15 on the back end to achieve the browning that I got. Would recommend this for a quick and easy meal, but you\u2019ll definitely need to add more seasoning based on your flavor profile.",

This cooking method produced a nice crispy outside, almost like the skin was there. Some reviewers (on other recipes) mention they'd take the skin off anyway. I wanted to add a little more flavor then what is listed, so I experimented. On the three thighs I had, I added (both sides): salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. To one I added a little cayenne, another smoked paprika, and the third some chipotle with garlic seasoning. All came out great!  On the second roasting time at 400F, I checked the meat temp with a thermometer 5 min prior to the time indicated, and they were already done. Thanks for this great recipe!",

Maybe a buttermilk marinade?",
