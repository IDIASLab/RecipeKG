Sized recipe for 6 servings and there was plenty left over. Took others suggestions and cut broth back to 2-1/2 cups from 3 added a can of diced tomatoes including juice added 3 large cloves of garlic (minced) added 1/2-lb. small/medium frozen shrimp (last 10 minutes) substituted turkey kielbasa for smoked sausage and substituted chopped baby bella mushrooms for canned. Sauteed bell pepper onion carrots (chopped) celery mushrooms & garlic until onions were soft. Added kielbasa and tomotoes after chicken was browned/cooked mostly through. A definite keeper in our family. Very rare when all agree the food was good. Thanks everyone for the great suggestions.",

I'm pretty sure it took me more than 15 minutes of prep time but I agree with the other reviews that this meal went over well with my husband and kids. I did follow other reviewers' leads and made my own adjustments chopping the carrots instead of slicing and sauteing them with the green peppers celery onion and of course lots of garlic. Then I added the chicken. I too added a can of diced tomatoes with the juice cutting back on the broth. I tend to like things a little more seasoned and spicy so next time I think I would add a tablespoon of cajun seasoning after adding the chicken and use andouille sausage instead of smoked. But all in all with some steamed broccoli on the side it was a pretty good meal.",
