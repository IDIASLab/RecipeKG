I had to add double the oil required and that still wasn't enough to smooths the texture in the finished product (I guess that's why Nutella uses Palm oil??) which dries out as it cools. But I know my family wouldn't mind if I just made this all the time instead of buying Nutella. But the taste surpasses the original. The hardest part of this was peeiling the skin off the hazelnuts.

I used vanilla extract powder for the liquid extract and no had no issue with it being too thick chocolate seizes when liquid is added and I think this is what is happening. I used canola oil for my oil. Lindt dark for the chocolate chips. I used this to fill 12 chocolatines. Thanks for the great recipe!",
