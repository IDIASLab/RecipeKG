Couldn t help myself but the original concept was inspiring and I followed it almost completely to the letter. Besides the embellishments you can see in the skillet I decided to lightly brown the tilapia filets a bit in a little EVOO & butter added a few shrimp premartinated in a little lemon juice a pinch of salt and a touch of crushed red pepper. I then set the fish & shrimp aside. I poured the broth in the same skillet added the orzo and let it cook the prescribed time. Next I added the French cut greens with the tomato. Added the fish n shrimp back in the pan sprinkled in a little oregano a pinch of rosemary the lemon zest and slices and voila. A big hit! Thanks again for the inspiration.",

Suffice it to say, this method with couscous and snap peas works very nicely. My fish needed an extra 2 minutes to become opaque and turned out wonderfully moist and tender. My family came to the dinner table decidedly bummed out that we were having fish for dinner, but were quickly giving compliments on how good it was.",
