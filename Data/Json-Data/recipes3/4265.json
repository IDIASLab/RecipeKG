I doubled the amount of veggies in the soup and still found that I could have added more (I really love a hearty chowder) I omitted the bell pepper due to dietary restrictions and added mushrooms, garlic and red onion. After getting the soup to a boil, I reduced the heat to low for an hour and a half, adding only half the cilantro and a little extra hot sauce after 15 minutes. Once I was almost ready to serve I got the soup back up to a boil, that is when I added the raw shrimp and scallops and then turned the element off and allowed the seafood to cook in the already hot soup.  This way I was able to get all the flavors from the wonderful veggies, ginger, fish stock ect and NOT overcook the seafood. This is a new favorite in my house! Thanks for the great recipe!",

Didn't have fish stock on hand because of this, so used two containers (11 oz) of coconut water. These also replaced the coconut milk. Then added water with some bouillion to make up the difference. The soup was waterier than I thought it would be, but I'm pretty sure it was because I didn't add the coconut milk. But I also think if you want it thicker you should cook the flour, butter and half&half to more of a thickness before adding the other ingredients.
