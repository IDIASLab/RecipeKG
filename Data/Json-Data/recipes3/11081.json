I found the sauce to be a little on the thick side and not nearly cheesy enough. Also there really wasn't enough of it to smother a decent-sized head of cauli. I added more milk and extra sharp Cheddar and also a bit of Coleman's mustard. Didn't have a lot of breadcrumbs so I made up the difference with Panko - worked well. Served it with British-style sausages. Fab!",
