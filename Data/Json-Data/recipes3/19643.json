I added one small onion and one garlic clove minced and saut\u00e9ed together. I also doubled up on the cottage cheese because it was just looking a little too spinach-y for me. And I'm reeeeally glad I did both of those things. It was wicked delicious especially with a roasted red pepper/Italian sausage sauce over top. The cook time is right on the amounts are perfect and I'm sure it'd be just fine for some without the onion/garlic/extra cheese. The beauty of a good recipe is it's versatility and this has it in spades. Thanks.",
