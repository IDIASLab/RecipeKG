I toasted the dry grains (not puffed millet) in a dry skillet for about 5min to bring out their nutty flavor/aroma then cooked the toasted grains porridge style (3:1 water to grains ratio) until the water was absorbed. Then added the other ingredients in this recipe (honey PB salt vanilla and raisins) and served as a warm cereal. It was a huge hit! Not surprised. It s very sweet and nutty. Next time I might do the same but with half the honey and PB (1/4cup each).",
