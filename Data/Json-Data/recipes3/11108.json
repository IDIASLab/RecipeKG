I seasoned it with Kickin' Chicken.  Then I added the veggies.  No mushrooms -- I didn't have any, and (sadly) I'm the only person in our house who likes them.  When I put in dried thyme (didn't have fresh), I added a little more Kickin' Chicken.  Used low sodium chicken broth.  I boiled it a bit longer than the recipe says, because I wanted to make sure the carrots would be tender.  I grated fresh Pecornio Romano (didn't have Parmesan), and ended up with a little more than 1/2 cup.  Seasoned the panko with a small amount of Kickin' Chicken.  ~~~ I was really pleased with the flavor and consistency.  I was worried about the flavor, but it turned out really good.  I don't know if it was the Kickin' Chicken, but I think the Pecorino Romano really added a lot!  Normally when making something like this, to be thickened with flour, I would have added it while saut\u00e9ing the veggies.  But I followed the recipe, and it turned out fine.  ~~~ We're very pleased with how this turned out.  It was easy, I had almost everything on hand (made adjustments for fresh thyme and Parmesan), and tasted good.  Thanks for the recipe!",

With the current cold snap it was the comfort food we longed for. The instructions were clear and straightforward. The only 'moment' I had was when I added the cream cheese a product I haven't used much. Looked pretty bad at first but I pressed on and followed the directions and it came out creamy smooth and delicious. It took me extra time as I had to cook up some breasts but ideal if you have some left-overs. I look forward to making it next time (and there will be a next time) with some left-over grilled chicken that smoky carmelization would really drive it over the top! And I know what I'll be doing with the leftover Thanksgiving Turkey in my near future. I think the best complement I can pay is that I cut this to four servings for the two of us with the expectation of leftovers for lunch tomorrow but we ate the whole thing!",

I had to cook a couple of chicken breasts so I seasoned them with paprika garlic powder dried thyme and pepper. I roasted them for about 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven turning them halfway through. I wasn't going to use 8 ounces of cream cheese but I decided to follow the directions as written. I did not use mushrooms because my husband does not like them so I added broccoli before placing the dish in the oven. I will prepare this again.",

I'm definitely saving this to my box. Oh I did use 2 tbls of flour. The panko crumbs probably didn't need salt because of the butter. Enjoy!!!!",
