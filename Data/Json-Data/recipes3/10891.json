But whatever, I was curious and wanted to give it a shot.\n\nPerhaps it's based on a difference in rice cooker models, but not surprisingly, after 40 minutes under heat and liquid (and the rice cooker did pop literally 12 seconds before the timer went off I had set), the noodles were all but mush.  Adding the rest of the ingredients doesn't really hide that fact, and it didn't make for a particularly great dish by itself either.  Now if you played with it and fixed the noodle consistency, I could see this being an alright base for adding in other ingredients like a bit of nicely prepared meat or mushrooms and peppers.  But at the end of the day, I feel like that's the problem with this one - it doesn't yield a Mac'n'cheese that I want to enjoy for being Mac'n'cheese.  What it came out closer to was a pretty solid base substitution for hamburger helper.  You can run with that, but it's not what I was hoping for from this recipe.",
