I doubled the sauce, I added more chopped garlic, cooked it in my favorite chardonnay, (use your favorite white wine) and cooked it to a reduction, (about 15 mins on high) I put in the chopped tomatos and cooked it for 4-5 mins before adding in the mussels and covering the pot with a lid, 5 mins into the mussels cooking I threw in the green onions and parsley, stirred it around and covered it for an additional 5 mins before it was done. \nI found that if you added the green onions, parsley and tomato too soon like the recipe calls for, you lose the flavor of all. In adding the veggies close to serving it keeps all of the natural flavors in. \nGreat recipe. ",

They ended up dazzling us and we both agreed they were better than any restaurant's.  So, I had to do a little research, but here's what I learned (after I had to throw away about 25% of the mussels I bought).  As a rookie, I didn't realize you have to 'air' out the mussels- as in, keep them cold but make sure they get air.  I looked up how to debeard them (you can find it on this site).  As for the recipe itself, sooooo good!  I would add a few extra tomatoes and don't skip the 'salt to taste' step (I forgot and it was better with a little bit of salt).  Serve with the crustiest bread you can find and drink the wine as you cook :-)",

I also followed the instructions from another review and added the parsley (I used fresh italian parsley) and onions the last five minutes of cooking. I also think that using fresh mussels is key...and as others have mentioned be sure to have some good bread because the sauce is amazing!! I will definitely be making this on a regular basis!!",
