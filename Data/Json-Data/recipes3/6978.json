A puff pastry sheet would barely cover the bottom of a 10 inch pie dish- I had to transfer it to an 8 inch pie dish. I used one large chopped onion and an 8 oz. package of baby portobello mushrooms and when mixed with the 8 oz. package of cream cheese it filled the 8 inch pie. I didn't need the yolk and milk mixture on top-it had a very nice sheen on the lattice-it looked beautiful and the flavor was wonderful.",
