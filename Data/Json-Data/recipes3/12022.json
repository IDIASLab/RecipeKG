Only differences I did was did not have fettuccine so used spaghetti (I know-not a big deal). Also did not add onions due to allergy. We had about a pound of shrimp that was not peeled or deveined and used that--not sure how much it was (weight) after the peeling. I kind of switched around the put this into that and fold this into that as it was easier with the pots and pans and bowls that were being used. Added some garlic bread and salad. Overall a good dinner. Thanks for sharing.",

I also added ~1 1/2 c broccoli in addition to the shrimp and mushrooms because I always ask for broccoli in the restaurants as my personal preference.   It was DELICIOUS and my family loved it too! Its a keeper for sure. The cream sauce was just the way I like it. It surely tasted like we were eating out at a restaurant. Served with parmesan cheese bread.   Thank you for a great recipe!",
