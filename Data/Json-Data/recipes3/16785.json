I changed the recipe a little bit because I didn\u2019t have the exact things I needed instead of shredded carrots I finely chopped baby carrots and I saut\u00e9ed them with the Union and celery, And I also added a little bit of Parmesan cheese to it. I saw other reviews about the spinach being too much but I used the amount called for and chopped it very finely and it was perfect! I would suggest doing step 2 first and setting chicken and cooked gnocchi on the side and doing step 1 and 3 together, I almost over cooked step 1 waiting for step 3 and I would also suggest cutting and having everything ready before starting to cook the meal as the steps go by very fast!  I will be saving this recipe and making again!",
