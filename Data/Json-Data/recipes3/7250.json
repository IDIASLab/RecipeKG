I didn't want this to be spicy because my two toddlers were eating it too so I only used a combination of 1 jalapeno seeded and red and yellow bell pepers only used half tablespoon of caraway seeds but next time I'll use the full amount (interesting but lovely adittion to the dish) and instead of fresh tomatoes I used one can of diced tomatoes (didn't have fresh). We ate this with a side of potatoes that I sliced thinly and fried with a little olive oil and a sprinkling of salt and pepper and some toast. One more to the recipe box!
