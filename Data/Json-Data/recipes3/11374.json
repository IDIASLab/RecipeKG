Even so, I pressed on and fried it up anyway. Yep, it certainly wasn't the most aesthetically pleasing dish I've ever made but it sure was yummy! I'll make this again after I get a cheesecloth.

I did not add any other additional salt. I used about a 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder added to the flour to help puff the fritters up. This recipe is very adaptable as far as the seasoning you can use. I might even try some Old Bay Seasoning next time....sorta like faux crab cakes. These would also be good as a side or appetizer if made smaller in size. This is a fun, and easy recipe to experiment with.",
