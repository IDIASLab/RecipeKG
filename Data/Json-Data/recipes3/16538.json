Oysters are a super source of zinc, an essential mineral for immunity, wound healing, and your sense of taste and smell. Zinc also supports growth in pregnancy, childhood and adolescence. Spinach is packed with antioxidants and nutrients that help protect vision, strengthen bones, and ward off cancer and heart disease. Older women who eat the most spinach and other greens cut their odds of breaking a hip by 30%.",

Very simple to prepare I did make a couple of modifications after reading the other reviews. I added hot sauce to the spinach mixture and also 2 heaping teaspoons of horseradish. I also combined parmesan cheese and grated romano cheese and sprinkled on top along with more hot sauce. We love Tabasco sauce on our oysters. The horsradish was a must! Thanks for sharing!",
