The starch level was much lower and they turned out golden brown and crispy! thank you for the recipie!",

As fast as I was making them, I was eating them.\r\n\r\nThe only problem that I came across with the recipie is my inability to slice anything paperthin.\r\n\r\nI did two half batches.  One that followed the recipe, and the other one where instead of soaking the potatoes in water I soaked them in vinegar.  Both turned out great.  I only soaked the potatoes in vinegar for probably ten minutes max, as I felt too long may take away from the original taste.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great recipe.  I'm going to keep this on hand, and next time when I make them I will most definately make the batch a lot bigger.",

It works great! Do make sure the potatoes you slice are paper thin. The whole \"chip\" will not get golden brown which is fine but as previous rating stated do wait for them to get a slight golden brown. I also have put these in a plastic bag to store them in. Use very very little salt if you resalt these after frying. These taste like Lays regular potato chips. Thank you sooo very much for this recipe! No more store bought potato chips for this family!",

Also, I placed chips onto a paper-towel lined cookie sheet and kept in the oven at 275 degrees until all the batches were fried. Came to the table hot and crispy. Thanks!",
