        "description": "Baked mozzarella sticks that are crispy on the outside and gooey inside. Even though they're not fried, with this recipe, they get crunchy without the mozzarella running out. The trick is in the dredging process and ingredients. Extra egg whites and light-as-air rice flour create a lighter coating. Quadruple-dipping creates a crispy outer coating usually absent from gluten free foods. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.",
