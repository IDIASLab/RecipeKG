The shanks we tend to get are huge and I cook like to cook them very low & slow (about 3.5 hours). I wish i had kept this in mind when making this dish. Next time I will add the sweet potato about an hour before serving not from the start as there were no discernible sweet potatoes left. I'm also thinking about substituting dried tart cherries for some of the apricots just to a little more complexity to the flavor.",
