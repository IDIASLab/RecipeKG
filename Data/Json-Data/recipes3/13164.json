While the rice was cooking in the broth, salt, and butter, I prepared and cooked the garlic and shrimp with lemon zest and juice.  Then when the rice was ready, I folded it in.  I then followed the rest of the recipe for adding the artichokes, spinach, and green onion.  I chopped the artichokes before adding them.  This was really delicious!  My husband and I both loved it.",

I didn\u2019t have any green onions so I chopped up a whole white onion and put it in the pan with garlic. Next time I will probably cook rice separate, since for some reason I\u2019m not sure of, since the rice on top didn\u2019t cook through. Turning over a few times may have fixed that. But was delicious and the lemon flavor was spot on. Chili paste was also a nice addition if you like spicier food.",
