                "reviewBody": "I thought the sauce was quite good! I used center-cut pieces of salmon, about 1 1/4\" inches thick. I broiled it for 5 minutes, added the sauce, then 3 minutes more (so 8 minutes total). I found it to be overdone for my liking. It was well done and very firm. I prefer mine about medium-well and a softer, juicier texture, so next time I would do 5 minutes, then 1 minute with the sauce. The other issue I had was the sauce burning in the pan. Because of the high sugar content, anything under the broiler will burn, so make sure you line your pan with foil, or use a pan you don't care about.  Thankfully the first itself didn't burn, but the pan was a burnt mess. It set off my smoke alarm, another reason to not have it in there 3 minutes with the sauce, and to only brush on a thin layer. You could drizzle the rest of the sauce over top upon removing from the oven.",
