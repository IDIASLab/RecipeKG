Yes, it was a little bland but easy to perk up with garlic, worchestershire sauce or BBQ sauce added to the mix before baking. I used both W. sauce and BBQ (made two batches) and both were great. Used sliced garlic sour dough bread. It was good but I think I'll try the biscuit thing next time. DO NOT use a honey wheat type bread. I ran out of the sour dough and had two muffins left so used what was on hand...uch! This is really fun to make with a kid. My 13 year old son helped and we had a great time. Thanks for sharing!",

The 11-year-old helped me we had a great time and it was quite an accomplishment for him (and for me being a cook who lacks presentation skills!). FABULOUS recipe! Could the hamburger be pre-cooked to reduce the fat? Even with lean meat (7%) they were a bit on the greasy side.",
