I also used unpeeled red potatoes, which I think are way better, plus the skin is good for you. It's unnecessary to \"lay the slices across the bottom of the skillet in a single layer,\" that takes forever and you'll probably need multiple skillets if you're cooking for a bunch of people. Just dump a reasonable amount of slices in, spread them out as much as possible, stir and make sure they're all coated with the melted butter/oil, maybe add a small dollop of butter to the top and then simply cover the skillet. Turn them every once in a while til they're done, works for me every time.",
