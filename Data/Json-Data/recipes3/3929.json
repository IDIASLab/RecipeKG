I thought there was too much nutmeg flavor, so next time I will reduce to 1/4 tsp.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and will definitely do that again.  Note that 3/4 lb. potatoes is the same as 2 1/2 cups cut up (in case you don't have a scale).  I peeled and cut the potato into chunks before boiling, so I omitted the skin removal and mashing steps (they mashed very easily when blending with a mixer with the other ingredients).  I mixed all wet ingredients with the potatoes in one bowl, then mixed all the dry ingredients in another bowl, putting them together at the end.  I did have to add more milk (almost 1/2 cup) to make them more spreadable.  Thanks so much for the recipe!",

Made this with my kids. it ended up as brunch b/c it took so long but it was delicious. i added vanilla and extra cinnamon per advice. they were tender and yummy. i was a bit worried about eye-ing 3/4 of a lb. of sweet potato so i did one large and one half of a meduim and that worked fine. i pricked and nuked my potatoes in the microwave for 15 minutes that made them just right. then i just opened them and scooped the insides out so i skipped the cold water thing.it was fine. i had my 2 yr old add the milk and vanilla too cool the potatoes b4 adding the egg. worked out great. If you find that your pancakes are rubbery its b/c you mixed them too much. mix it until just combined well then leave it. oh i also let the batter rest about 30 min. per other reviews. We ate it with homwmade applesauce so minus the syrup. I wouldnt make it again for a normal breakfast b/c of the time it took but i can see doing this (minus the kiddies) for a bring-a-dish affair",
