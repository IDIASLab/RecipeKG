I did have to substitute a mixture of chopped spring onions and white onions for the leeks since I didn't have any and I only had dried tarragon on hand so I used 1 Tbsp plus 1 tsp. The flavor was good other than the salt issue. It's great to have a new use for all of the heads of lettuce we have been getting from our csa!",

The lettuce was a little tough from being left in the ground too long so I had to find another use for it besides salad. This recipe fit the bill perfectly! I cut the unsalted butter to 2 tbsp. used low sodium chicken broth and I only added 1 tsp. of salt which was the perfect amount in my opinion. I also did not blend it preferring to leave it chunky and I'm glad I did it that way. No yogurt or sour cream needed! It's fantastic as is. You definitely have to like tarragon though which I do. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks!",

A perfect light soup for summer when your garden is producing so much lettuce that if you see another salad you'll scream:) I used all the lettuces that were getting to large. Meuslun mix romain and butter/bib. Had no leeks so used a combo of a bit of onion and some scallions. 3 small cloves of comfey garlic salted butter and organic chicken stock so added no salt till just before serving. It needed a pinch along with the pepper. I always use an immersion blender easier and mess/cleanup. The tarragon was a terrific touch though I wonder what adding mint one time would be like having way more mint growing then the tarragon.",
