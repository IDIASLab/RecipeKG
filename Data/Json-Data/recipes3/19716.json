After reading the reviews, here's what I did differently:  Added chopped onion. pressed garlic and sliced mushrooms while browning meat.  Used 1 bouillion cube and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup.  Everything else was the same.  Oh, I did just keep adding worchestershire sauce to taste.  This dish was certainly thick enough to serve over toast or biscuits this way.  I served mine with mashed potatoes and peas however.  It's just what I had on hand.",

Pour the SOS over a pile of hashbrowns, then put a couple of over-easy eggs on top of that. Cut through it all with a knife so the runny yokes, SOS and hashbrowns are mixed. Then wolf it down along with some strong black coffee. That is a breakfast to help you face the day. For additional authenticity, eat outside, standing up, in the dark, on a cold morning, while whiffing deisel fumes from a nearby truck. Ah, the memories.",

As the meat is browning I add both garlic and onion powder about a teaspoon of each to 1 lb as well as the other seasoning. Be carefull with the salt however because beef bullion tends to be salty. I substitute a pinch of celery seed for the worcestershire sauce. I don't want the \"batch\" to be to brwn. My kids love it!",

I also added a half an onion, diced, to the beef.  I really didn't measure the Worchestershire sauce, just let some bobble on out of the bottle, but I'm sure it was more than 1/4 teaspoon.  I also added a cup of frozen peas with the milk.  I served this over refrigerated jumbo whomp biscuits from a cardboard can.  Very comforting and good.  Will definitely make again.",
