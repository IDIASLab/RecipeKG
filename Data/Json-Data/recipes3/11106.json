My one and only complaint is that lamb is expensive here so that's another reason I'm glad it turned out well. Don't be afraid to wait until the stew is done to start the No Yolks Dumplings. A few extra minutes won't hurt this at all. The tomatoes did not overwhelm and I was glad to have green beans in the stew instead of a more starchy vegetable. I had never noticed the dumplings before shopping for this recipe. They are wider than the normal noodle and though not exactly a dumpling to this southern gal the noodles had a good flavor. Thanks for the idea!",
