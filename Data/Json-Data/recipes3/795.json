It was creamy and had a nice consistency..not too heavy, not too light  Everyone loved the hint of almond flavor.  I did not experience the grainy texture that others had mentioned. I did make sure to follow the directions and alternately add and beat the heavy whipping cream and powdered sugar.  Also, I cut this recipe in half and had PLENTY of frosting left.  I frosted a \"lambie\" shaped cake (which needed a lot of frosting to give it a wooly texture). Greatest frosting recipe ever. I highly recommend this recipe!",
