I ended up adding a little more flour and cornmeal to thicken a bit and it was still runnier than I am used to for waffles but they came out great! My whole family ate them up. The texture is interesting so if you are cooking for anyone who might be averse to the slight grittiness from the course ground cornmeal then be aware. They aren't too crunchy just gritty as stated:) Thank you!",

The only difference is we use 1/2 cup cornmeal/ 1 1/2 cup flour 3 tbsp oil and 3 tsp baking powder for the pancakes. Everything else the same so this recipe could be used for both pancakes and waffles. I didn't realize that you could use so much cornmeal and still have great waffles/pancakes. I will use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.",
