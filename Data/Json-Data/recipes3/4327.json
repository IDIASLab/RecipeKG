My folks and I happen to like liver, but my mom quickly discovered that even people who \"can't stand\" it ask \"What is this and may I have the recipe?\"   It's important to NOT overcook the liver. Most people cook it till it's shoe leather, which is probably why people can't stand the stuff\u2014shoe leather is never tasty.   Reduced fat sour cream works, but fat-free not so much. Don't let boil the sauce or it separates. Serve the sauce and onions over hot rice. Add brightly colored veggies\u2014salad, broccoli, crisp fresh green beans\u2014and oh my my what a delicious, and vitamin rich, banquet fit for your best guests!",

I used butter but I think in the future I will use olive oil and save the calorites in butter for somtething when I cannot substitute butter. I quickly sauted the liver as it was not that thick and I did not want to overcook it. I used a 4 oz can of button mushrooms along with the juice and about 1/3 cup light red wine. I decided to use 1 can of mushroom soup (undiluted) and only about 3 large Tbs of sour cream. I also added a few dashes of gravy bouquet for good flavor and browning color. Only a few dashes of worcestershire sauce as I did not want to overwhelm the gravy bouquet flavor. I felt my gravy was not thick enough and I had leftover mashed pots that I was going to put the liver over but decided to add them to the liver mixture. Hint: I could have used another large onion that would have improved the texture of this dish plus more interest. All in all I think it turned out very good and will fix it again and it is probably one of the best liver dishes I have ever had or made. Very Good",
