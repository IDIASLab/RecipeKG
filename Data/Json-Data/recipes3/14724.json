Because I like Cajun food a bit on the spicy side, I used RoTel tomatoes rather than regular ones, also, and I used fresh okra (which I cut up myself) as well (but frozen okra will do just fine, as long as its unbreaded).  A word of caution: Cajun/Creole pre-mixed spice, such as Tony Chachere's or Zatarain's, already has plenty of salt in it, as well as red pepper and other spices. If you use the spice, don't use additional salt. Instead, just use the Cajun/Creole spice to taste, and if you want a bit more zip, you can splash a dash or two of Tabasco onto your serving, which won't substantially add salt.  Serve it up with some hot garlic bread, and you've got a quick, simple meal in itself. Also, if you want a twist, rather than adding shrimp, boil a couple or three chicken breasts until they're cooked, cut them into chunks, and make chicken and andouille stew. You'll love it!",

Anyway onto the rating. I think this was quite good though I felt like it was a wee bit too salty for my taste. I'll have to check if my Cajun seasoning I used contained salt. My husband felt it was too spicy (wimp) but a family friend who previously resided in New Orleans said it was excellent and not spicy at all. I served this over brown rice and boy does it stick to your ribs! Thanks for the recipe! P.S. It was impossible for me to find fresh or frozen okra at any grocery store in this area (NJ) - I checked 4 stores! Finally just bought fresh at Produce Junction. We Northerners are denied easy okra access!:P",
