The only thing that I did differently was that for the topping I whipped my cream cheese separately from the other ingredients for about 5 minutes on medium speed. This made the cream cheese a bit fluffier and make for a very flakey, buttery crust! Also, I think the cake is plenty sweet without adding the powdered sugar to the top after cooling. I left that part out and wasn't disappointed. I think if I had added the powdered sugar to the top it would have been just a bit to sweet. Other than those few adjustments, GREAT recipe! My family loved it and I am making another tonight.",
