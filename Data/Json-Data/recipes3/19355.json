It does makes huge amounts so halve it unless you're cooking it for a big party. It works best if you sift your confectioners sugar and cocoa to get rid of lumps. It's easy to make but does require lots of stirring. It gets stiff very quickly so I wound up kneading it with my hands. I took it to a party and everyone raved over it. I do think it's best not to tell people what is in it until they've made their mind up about it. Some people are very suggestible and if you tell them it has cheese in it the cheese will be all that they taste. Otherwise you really don't notice the cheese. I used Velveeta and it worked nicely. I also substituted 2 cups chopped pecans for the peanuts and I thought that was about right.",

Make sure your dry milk is very finely granulated if you do this. Also yummy with lots and lots of chopped pecans in it. Delicious!",

I wish I had halved the recipe because it took a very large mixing bowl and quite a while to mix in all that powdered sugar (I actually burned up the motor on my cheap hand mixer) so I recommend a large table mixer with a dough hook. The texture is to die for though! Definitely worth it and you can NOT taste the Velveeta.",
