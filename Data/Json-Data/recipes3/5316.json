Changes I made: 1) I used 1 cup of orange juice to create more sauce; 2) I don't have a 12\" frying pan with a lid, so I substituted a Dutch oven-it worked great; and 3) I turned down the heat after pulling the asparagus out so the sauce wouldn't burn (oranges have a high amount of sugar).  Next time: 1)I may add cumin or other dried spice next time to thicken the glaze and spice it up, depending on the main dish and 2) to avoid undesireable day after \"asparagus side effects,\" next time I will use broccoli.  That's the only reason I would give 4 stars, but that's not the fault of the asparagus.",
