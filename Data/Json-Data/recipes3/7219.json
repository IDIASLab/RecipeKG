Marinated the steak for a little over 1 hour and sliced it against the grain. We are ketchup and Hienz 57 people and neither of these condiments were necessary. Which is very unusual for us. Definitely a keeper. I served it with sliced tomatoes out of our garden and homemade potato salad.",

Using a meat thermometer or simply cutting a slit on top of the steak and taking a peek would have given a good clue as to the \"doneness\" of the steak. The 4 minute per side was I'm sure relative to the heat source (medium high heat to me is probably different to what you consider medium high). A good rule of thumb is NEVER take cooking times stated in any recipe as gospel. Use your eyes and a meat thermometer the next time to avoid an under cooked piece of meat.",
