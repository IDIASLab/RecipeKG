It is less complicated than it looks though I will prep the ingredients in advance next time.....and there will be a next time. I did forget to add the mushrooms and next time I will skip the anchovy, but it is definitely a hardy & tasty meal on a cold winter night. Get things going early in the day and this will be done in a jif at dinnertime. Thanks so much for sharing:)",
