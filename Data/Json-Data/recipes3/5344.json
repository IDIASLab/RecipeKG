I did reduce the recipe to make for 4 servings so maybe that would make a difference don't see how but you never know. The only thing that I would change with them is to use fresh thyme rather than dried as the thyme didn't soften up so much and we got some little dried sticks while we were eating. Other than that great recipe.",

I also used garlic pepper seasoning instead of just pepper and fresh thyme. I cooked until the potatoes were fork tender, about 50 minutes. It was good, we like garlic and it did have good garlic flavor plus we could taste the olive oil. The liquid did not get absorbed, as seen in the before/after photo. Perhaps my modified proportions was off. Still, they were good and we'd use the recipe again.",
