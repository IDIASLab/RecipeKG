This gluten-free version uses a trick from the past when Italian cooks would toss potatoes into a fire or oven that was being cooled down so as not to waste the heat. Surplus baked potatoes became gnocchi because they have very little moisture (the secret to firm gnocchi) and they have a roasted potato flavor, taking your dish one step farther.",

I scaled down the recipe a bit because I had less leftover baked potato than in the recipe but it turned out fine. Really good in alfredo and creamy sauces. After they rose to the surface while cooking, I seared them in an oiled pan. Amazing! Tip though, they do not freeze well.",
