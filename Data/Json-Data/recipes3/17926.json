I had to cook wings and potatoes longer before adding nachos to pan to get the crispness I desired. Added cheese to potatoes when I added nachos for a little more goodness. Wing sauce has fantastic flavor. Overall a great hot app to put out for a crowd - everything was well received. Will make again!",
