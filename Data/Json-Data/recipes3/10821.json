The dip was super creamy with amazing flavor. And of course, the flavors really develop the longer it sits, but it was so good, we had a hard time not demolishing all of it right away! The black garlic is not interchangeable with anything else, so make sure you don't leave it out! It provides little pops of sweetness and umami within the creamy and salty dip.  The recipe didn't specify, however I am assuming from the fact you are to \"flake\" the salmon that you should use HOT-smoked salmon instead of cold-smoked. (Cold-smoked doesn't flake, however it would also be tasty, I'm sure.)  A definite keeper recipe!",
