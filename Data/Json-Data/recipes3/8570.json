The recipe doesn't specify but I used the tiny French green lentils instead of red or brown, I didn't have chicken stock on hand so used water and chicken bouillon cubes.  This was terrific.  I added a dash more red pepper for extra bite.  I also had some smoked sausage that I cubed and browned with the veggies but it would have still been fabulous without it.  This recipe is simple and so good.  I looked at other recipes before settling on this one, this has general items most people have on hand, no need for white wine or some of the other stuff the other recipes ask for, I plan to make this again!  Thanks for sharing a good recipe!",

I added some potatoes to it, and after that the spices seemed to diminish a lot, if not totally disappear.  Before I added them, it was quite tasty and the spices were very prominent.  If the potatoes are what changed it, then without them this is an excellent recipe.  I am going to give it another go at a future date w/o potatoes.",
