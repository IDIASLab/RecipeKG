The optional dry ice would have been great but since this was just a trial batch I did not use it. The one thing I did not care for was the texture the gummy worms get after being frozen. I know they are more for looks but they turn weird. They are real soft and jello like on the outside but then hard and chewy in the center. Overall a fun punch though with good flavor and one that would be a big hit at a party.",
