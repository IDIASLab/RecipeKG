Most of these seasoning are sold in powder form rather than as a salt. The Russian dressing is another added salt bomb.\nI make a delicious brisket in the oven using about 3 handfuls of onions, 1/2 under brisket and 1/2 on top. A couple of sprinkles of Lawrey's, 1 c. water and aluminum foil to seal and bake for about 3-3 1/2 hrs. Testing with a fork until soft \"like butter\". .Simple and easy. The you can make sandwiches with any kind of sauce and go withs.",
