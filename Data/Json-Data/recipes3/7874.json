The texture is a blend between a cornbread and a casserole so the name is a bit misleading but...........I really liked it! If I make it again I would add some more seasoning maybe some minced garlic and Old Bay. It definitely reminded me of something you would find at a Southern family reunion--comforting and somewhat mysterious; ).",
