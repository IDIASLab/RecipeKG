Used only about 3Tbs butter equal parts Honey Syrup (about 2-3Tbs ea) tsp of dried mustard and a capful of Vanilla. This gave the glaze a suble sweetbuttery flavor but NOT overpowering. Added the Walnuts and let it simmer while Salmon cooked. Only used about 2Tbs of oil to coat bottom of pan... Salmon BROWNED nicely. The glaze was the PERFECT compliment to the CRUSTY Salmon and the VERY soft Walnuts. As with most recipes... I am a TASTER... I can always ADD but cannot remove an ingredient. THANKS...",

The recipe calls for 1.5 lbs of fish and we only had 1 lb of fresh Atlantic salmon so I tried to modify the sauce ingredients to suit. We baked the salmon instead of pan frying it (just seasoned with a little sea salt and pepper) and cut the sauce ingredients by 1/3. Although the sauce was quite sweet we liked it with the fish. The only problem we had with it was that once the sauce cooled it became very gummy and thick. This could be attributed to not measuring the sauce ingredients properly though. When making this again I will make all of the sauce but decrease the amount of pecans - we liked it on ice cream too!",
