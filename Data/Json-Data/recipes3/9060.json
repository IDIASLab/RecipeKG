I knew it, but I followed the instructions anyway, ended up  adding another 5 Tbsp milk, and it still wasn't \"creamy.\"  However.......it certainly has potential to be 5 stars.  I would add  one more step which wouldn't add much more time to preparation.  Add some boiling water to the oatmeal until you achieve the right consistency, then stir in the other ingredients and microwave just long enough for the peanut butter and the blueberries to soften.  It's certainly worth another try because the combination of ingredients really makes a tasty oatmeal.",

I think with a little tweaking it could be much better. Three and a half stars.",
