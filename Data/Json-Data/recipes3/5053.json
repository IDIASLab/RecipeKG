This tasted like awesome slow made risotto and it was supper easy. I love risotto and I will probably never make the slow stove top version again Why waste the time? Let the oven do the work! I doubled the recipe but still used the same sized pan. It turned out light and fluffy. The leftovers were the perfect light lunch. I still have all the ingredients and I am going to make more of this latter this week Everyone asked for the recipe because it was so super easy and so super good.
