Due to food allergies I could not use the prepared couscous so instead I used 2 teaspoons homemade Italian Seasoning and 4 servings pearled Israel couscous cooked according to the package instructions. The recipe does not say what to do with the sauce so I mixed some into the turkey-couscous mixture and spread some onto the bottom of the serving plate. This dish would be amazing as a one pot wonder; after the meet is browned saut\u00e9 diced peppers along with the onion then add in the couscous and sauce. Which is exactly what I am going to do next time.",
