I was really intrigued by this idea so after reading other reviews I used a whole mango and a whole small sweet onion coated with olive oil and sprinkled with a caribbean sea salt. After I got it pureed with the remaining ingredients I thought it lacked acid and flavor but as I was having trouble getting past the flavor of the cilantro I left it alone. Sadly it was the least popular of all my suggestions but I still find myself wanting to play around with the idea. Thank you so much for the inspiration!",
