After browning the meat, stir in soups and sour cream, then add to baking dish. Topped that with grated cheddar, topped with taters, and then added a bit more cheese 10 mins til I was done, and topped that with french cut green beans. Turned out very good with the beans on top. The taters actually were crunchy on top, and fell apart on the bottom, and mixed with the soup. ",

My husband and daughter smothered it in catsup (which says something). The bottom of the tater tots were kind of soggy (as they sat in the meat/cheese mixture). This is a very heavy meal.
