It coated the spaghetti nicely. This is like using basil pesto on spaghetti; pesto is also not a cooked sauce. If you don't like garlic then I would not make a \"garlic sauce.\" If it seems too dry for you when you add it to the pasta you can always save a little bit of the pasta water and add it to the spaghetti after you have coated it with the sauce. This is like many of the true Sicilian sauces that we serve in our Italian household. Yum!",

The salad was eaten and enjoyed to the last bite instead of getting tossed due to being soggy. Thanks for sharing this gem!",

My husband (who's an avid health nutrition and fitness advocate and an Italian) eats it by the spoonful. I ALWAYS have to double it because it goes so fast. You can add more garlic if you love garlic (like we do) or less garlic if you're a light weight. There have been times when I forgot or didn't have certain ingredients like - parsley or Olive oil. It was still fantastic! You can adjust this recipe to your likes and I don't think you can go wrong. I think it's also a perfect main course recipe for vegans and vegetarians.

Following other's lead I cooked it a bit to tame the garlic a little. Served over spinach and cheese ravioli topped with parmesan. This one is already saved in my recipe box! Thank you!!",
