Next time I would definitely double the garam masala because I couldn't really taste the spices at all (I did go easy on the cayenne though because I don't care for hot spiciness). Thanks for a good idea. I might try this again but use different vegetables and experiment with the spicing. Thanks!",

I didn't want mushy vegetables. I hand mashed them and left some of the potatoes chunky. For seasoning I added 1 tablespoon (yes one tablespoon) of garam masala. I'm used to spicy food and this was still mild flavour with a kick. I also grated one medium onion and two garlic cloves. The first time I made this I used only seasoned bread crumbs. They turned out great but this time I made them with 3/4 a cup of seasoned bread crumbs added to the potato mixture and I dipped them in egg and about 3/4 cup of panko. They turned out much crispier. The seasoned bread crumbs added to the flavour but I will continue to use panko as the breading. I top these with mango chutney. Everybody who has had them says they're great!",

I used homemade breadcrumbs which were a combination of whole wheat and rye in the patties and panko for the coating. They were not bad. The spices perked up an otherwise rather bland mix. It is a good use of leftovers but I can't imagine myself making these oherwise. Thanks for sharing.",
