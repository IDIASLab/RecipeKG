The only change I made was to use only a small amount of olive oil (appx 1 1/2 - 2 TBSP) which I m sure may have changed it from the original intent but it was great for us! We have to eat Gluten Free and it s a perfect recipe for that. It was nice to find a new easy salmon recipe with an Indian influence (I ve had very little experience with Indian food and this was a nice uncomplicated way to help get my feet wet.) I highly recommend this one! Thanks Tarma!",

Served it with rice and the Butter Chickpea Curry from this site but I liked it better with curried cauliflower that I found on another site. Also I didn't use that much oil just enough to sear - I didn't even coat the entire bottom and that works fine.",
