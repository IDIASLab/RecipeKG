I like a mix of darker mushrooms so I used crimini and shitake. Make sure to boil off all the mushroom liquid which will probably take longer than 5 minutes. I used extra mozz. on top. Very satisfying Fall flavored dish!",

My son won't eat mushrooms, so I substituted some sauteed sliced carrots  and frozen spinach. I doubled the amount of ricotta, and I used the shredded asiago cheese I had rather than Parmesan. I also, listening to the comment about the pasta being raw, did a couple of things. I dipped each noodle in water before putting it into the dish, so there would be moisture to be absorbed right there. \nI poured on a little extra cream on top of the top layer of noodles, before adding the pumpkin mixture. I also prepared the dish the night before up to the baking stage, and let it sit absorbing liquid overnight in the refrigerator wrapped in foil. Then I baked it after work, About 10 minutes longer under the foil than stated in the recipe. This cooked the lasagna noodles to al dente. It was so good. This will absolutely become part of our regular rotation. Thank you so much for this wonderful invented dish!",
