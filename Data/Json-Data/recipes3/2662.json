Personally, I prefer the individual filets, particularly when it's just two of us (makes for more manageable sizes of leftovers).  When doing the whole tenderloin, make sure you have a meat thermometer handy -- the baking times listed will get you to a rather red rare tenderloin, which may not be what you'd prefer.  I'd also recommend placing the wellington on a rack for baking, to keep the pastry out of the juices.  To do individual filets, I skipped the initial browning step, chopped the mushrooms rather than slicing them, skipped the pate (didn't have any on hand), and wrapped each filet separately.  We baked it at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes, which got the pastry just barely golden and the meat medium rare.  But again -- a thermometer is definitely helpful in this recipe!",

My only advice is make sure you buy the absolutely best pate you can afford and invest in a good cut of tenderloin; it will really make the difference in the overall quality of the dish.  My only other suggestion is use a rack to lift the filets off the bottom of the pan so that pastry doesn't become soggy from the pan juices.",

The key to keeping the bottom from getting too soggy is to add a small bit of cold toast that is rounded off with crusts cut off (so as not to tear the pastry.  This soaks up any juice keeping the bottom crispy.  No one was aware it was there, even after I'd told them. I also seared the meat in a frypan.
