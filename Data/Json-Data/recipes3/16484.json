Instead of using green bell peppers (neither my significant other nor I are fans) I used red and yellow bell peppers nixed the mushrooms and spinach and used 1 clove of garlic and 3/4 of a white onion instead of using onion powder. Since I didn't have corn oil on hand I used canola oil which worked out wonderfully. I added the cilantro after cooking the dish (since I think raw cilantro looks prettier and imparts a more distinct flavor than cooked cilantro) along with a scallion that I had in the fridge. I served the dish with sliced avocado atop fresh salsa Mexican rice and corn tortillas. My boyfriend said it was better than our favorite local Mexican restaurant's fajitas!",
