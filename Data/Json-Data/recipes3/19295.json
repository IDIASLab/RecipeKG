I was asked for the recipe by a couple of people (though I'll have to change the name so I stop getting asked \"who's Cindy?\") Don't worry about getting the wings perfectly covered with the preserves - it all slides off anyway. I cooked at 350 for the hour and got nice browning - I could see where 400 would burn. When done just pour the whole mess into a crockpot to keep warm and serve. Be sure to have pen and paper handy so people can write the recipe down...they will ask. I've been told I have to make this recipe for family at Christmas too (have I raved enough about it?)",

After several tries and ending up with runny watered down sauce I decided to experiment a bit. What I've ended up doing is to put the frozen wings in a roasting pan and cook them for about an hour (or longer) to thaw them draw off the extra water and to render most of the fat. I drain that off and mix the jam soup mix and Catalina dressing together then toss the wings in the mixture. I spread them out on a greased jelly roll pan and then broil them until one side is done. Then I flip them all over and broil until the second side is cooked and the sauce is thick and sticky. It takes MUCH longer than the original instructions but it's the only way I've found to not have the sauce so watery that it was pointless to have it there at all. If someone else has a better way please share it because I love the flavor from this recipe but they are a bit more work than I have to invest at times. It's still worth making this recipe though!",

In a separate container, I mixed together the preserves, soup mix and salad dressing for an even distribution of flavor.  Then I poured the mix over the wings.  I baked for 45 minutes at 350 degrees, then increased to 400 degrees for the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Wings were served with sauce dipped over them.  I will definitely make these again.

Thanks for the great reviews and variation tips for my recipe (I've started using more apricot preserves than what the recipe calls for and drizzling a little less catalina dressing--using about half of the bottle). When I originally submitted this recipe I suggested using frozen wings.  However, I've found that using fresh wings, cutting them into individual pieces, and turning them over half way through cooking keeps the glaze from getting too watery.  Just thought I'd pass on this little tidbit of information.  Also, with regards to the temp....I recommend 375 to 400.",

I don't know but I choose to thaw them and then I quick-fried them in a pan (maybe 5 minutes) so that they wouldn't be mushy (texture issue for me).
