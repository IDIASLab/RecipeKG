Yes, it was gooey and the texture was AMAZING, but because of all the processed cheese, my body didn't want to digest any more. Also, when I went to fetch some more the next morning, it was almost frozen even though it was in the fridge and not the freezer. The ingredients tense up when put under cold. It heated up fine -- however, some butter separated from the rest of the ingredients. I recommend eating it all in one night (which I don't think is possible unless you have a lot of people because of your body rejecting the processed cheese).",
