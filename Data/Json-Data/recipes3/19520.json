I would have never decided to make this if I had not seen the fish at at the counter.  After removing the membrane from the fish i seasoned both sides with coasher salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Then put them on some parchment paper and covered them with melted butter and lemon.  While they were in the oven I melted some butter and added coasher salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, and lemon to create a sauce.  Then plated the fish on top of some risotto with carrots and spooned the sauce on top of that.  Extremely delicious dish.",

I love lobster, and had heard this tastes similar and it does!  I didnt have paprika, so I used a little lemon pepper and served it with melted butter to dip it in and lemon wedges.  Some asparagus and rice and my husband and I are still going on about dinner.  I left off the breadcrumbs.",

The flavors were really good and though it isn't exactly lobster the flavor is close and the texture is very similar. My family really enjoyed this. There is a membrane on this fish and it would have turned out better if I had trimmed more of it off. Brushing butter and spice blend on the fish is a terrific way of keeping the fish moist and adding flavor.",
