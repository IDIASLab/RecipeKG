I'm only giving it 4 stars because I changed some of the ingredients so I don't know how many stars it would be if you followed the recipe exactly. The way I prepared it was definitely 5 stars and my hubby asked me to put it on weekly rotation! While browning the chicken in the skillet I added garlic and fresh cut onions. I also added oregano along with the salt pepper and greek seasonings while browning. I couldn't get the chicken to cook all the way through without the outside getting too brown so I cooked it most the way through and let it finish cooking while it was simmering with the tomatoes and green beans. I used the canned tomatoes that have oregano and stuff in them (more italian). And instead of using the greek salad dressing I used fat free italian (low cal and delish). I also added marinated mushrooms and omitted the olives (didn't have those on hand plus the hubby doesn't like them). I can't say it was the most visually appealing meal but it was definitely one of the most tasty!",

I wasn't really comfortable leaving frozen chicken over medium high heat but it didn't say to turn it down or cover until the very end. Also I had no idea what Greek seasoning was so I looked for it in the grocery store and no luck. I ended up making my own from a recipe I found on line(which has salt and pepper in it so I skipped that in the recipe). Not difficult just one more step the first time you make this recipe. It turned out great though. I would add an extra can of green beans next time. Oh and I melted Feta cheese over all at the end. Great flavor.",
