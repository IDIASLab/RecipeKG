This one was a hit and was very easy to prepare.  Everyone loved them and made sure to take some to go.  They were very well seasoned with the chicken broth, turkey leg and garlic.  Only difference is that we bought the pre-washed Wal-Mart bags of collard greens, but still cooked them for the time outlined in this recipe.  We used 4 bags with this recipe.  Next time we can probably cut back and only use 3, because it made a whole lot.",

My mother had doubts that I could make some decent collard greens for the Thanksgiving table, but I reassured her that even though I had never attempted to cook my own, she would love mine! I was going to use a hamhock, but I waited until the last minute to shop (Thanksgiving Eve) and the grocery store was out of them! I hoped and prayed that smoked turkey legs wouldn't compromise flavor. Boy, was I jumping for joy when I tasted my collard greens while they were cooking! I made sure to clean them very thoroughly (rinsed them 3 times in cold water). Removed the stems, and ripped the leaves into smaller pieces with my hands. The chicken stock, onion (I added 1 small onion), and garlic added so much flavor! I think the key to making some good collards is to wash them thoroughly and to cook them through until they are tender. Don't hesitate to cook them a bit longer! You want them to have the same texture as barely wilted spinach- but let's face it, collards have so much more flavor :) Thanks for being a godsend! Mom and family had high praises. We dunked our breadrolls and cornbread in the delicious broth :9 Yum! * Prior to serving, I took the legs out, chopped into smaller pieces, and checked thoroughly for any loose pieces of cartilage in the greens.",

Don't add more than a couple of tsp because you don't want the greens to taste sweet.  Two, I add a couple of tablespoons of vinegar. I use rice vinegar but I don't think it makes a difference. Three, experiment with seasonings. I add garlic, onion powder, season salt, and others that I have experimented with over the years.  The red pepper flakes are definitely a must but should be added maybe a half hour before cooking is complete.  Last, try experimenting with different smoked meats.  I've found that a combination of smoked turkey and smoked pork takes my greens over the edge.  I have sliced fresh tomato handy for folks to cut up in their greens and a little pepper soaked vinegar.  Been making greens this way for years.  Never had one complaint and I am always asked to cook the greens at every occasion.  Experiment and find combinations that you and your family will love",
