It's very accepting of almost any veggie you'd like to add - my faves are thin carrot strips fresh green beans and even potatoes. Also a great use of a rotisserie chicken from the store. Easy to make more or less hot and/or spicy according to your family's preferences (I've changed via amounts and types of spices: more or less curry cumin including toasted cumin seeds hot pepper flakes etc). And since I have most of these things in my cupboards all the time anyway - voila! I did use milk tho cause no 1/2-1/2 in the fridge. My favorite part of curry is the toppings so I always have some combination of the following: toasted coconut sliced green onions banana slices toasted almond slivers (my favorite) raisins or currents chutney or chopped peanuts. My family loves this stuff!!! EDIT: used coconut milk tonight - makes a really delicious and creamy sauce.",

I love curry but this dish seemed a little one dimensional to me - no real depth of flavor other than curry powder.

This was good but I will probably not make it again as there are many other curry dishes I enjoy more.",
