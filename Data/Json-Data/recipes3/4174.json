When served over hot rice it IS filling and it IS tasty and everyone like it but I don't think the 2 hour cooking time made it all that much more moist or flavorful. I'm patient enough for a two-hour wait when it results in something \"fabulous\" - not just \"good.\" Perhaps I should have started it the night before as suggested by the submitter. Either way my less-than-positive review is NOT a reflection on the taste just the prep time and final results. I'd say try it if you love chicken and celery (and you have the time). Thanks!",
