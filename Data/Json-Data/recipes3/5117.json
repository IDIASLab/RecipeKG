First substituted 3/4 cup Monterey Jack (for 4 servings) with 1/2 cup low-fat cream cheese and substituted cream with equivalent volume of skim milk. The cream cheese provided sufficient creaminess. To provide an extra \"kick\" I added 1/3 cup dry vermouth to the chicken at the end of saute. I could have added more liquid (either milk or wine/vermouth) for a more fluid sauce. Overall very good flavor. I agree with Joannah that fewer peppers would enhance the dish. Would definitely make again with similar modifications.",
