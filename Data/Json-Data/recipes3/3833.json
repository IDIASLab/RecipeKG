Because I was a little nervous about the curry powder (didn't want to take a chance of having to throw a shrimp omelet out if we didn't like it!) I decided to be a wimp and use only half the amount of curry called for. I'm glad I did. It gave it a pleasant nuance of flavor and aroma but any more and I know it would have been too much for us. The recipe came together perfectly with the prep and cooking method as described.",
