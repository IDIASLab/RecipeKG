Nice presentation for a quick meal for company on the fly. I was worried about the sweetness using balsamic as the primary liquid and I thought spicy would be nice. I added crushed red chili peppers to the bell peppers..it was fantastic. I was crunched for time so I used skinless chicken thighs whole instead of the breasts. I think it really enhanced the flavor (slthought adding calories aargh!). I also added most of the balsamic all at once turning the chicken once but mainly keeping the bottoms down to prevent the chicken from darkening too much in the balsamic.Also I'd like to note to keep an eye on the heat when you are 'finishing' the chicken as you dont want the balsamic to reduce too much. Good job all in all..thanks so much for the recipe..it's a keeper.",

To save time I used a bag of Japanese stir fry veggies (carrots, peppers, broccoli, and water chestnuts).
