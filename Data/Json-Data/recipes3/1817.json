The directions are a bit confusing when it comes to cutting the potato. \"Through a long side\"? I read that as lengthwise but that didn't seem right to me. I cut them hassleback style so that I could get a good \"fan\" on them. Whichever way you choose to cut them, don't skip the onions. They are magical. Excellent recipe!",

Be careful when slicing that you don't cut so far as to make the break apart while cooking. I used russet potatoes but would have preferred Yukon Gold due to the inherent bitterness of the russet potato skin. Be aware that the butter disappears into the potato. I suggest adding plenty of Vidalia onions on top before wrapping them in foil. After cooking these on the grill I researched Hasselback potato recipes and found several alternative recipes. I will bake them in the oven the next time I make them to see if they really do come out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside like a french fry as described.",
