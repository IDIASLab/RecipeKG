I also added some fresh ground black pepper to taste. Cooked it in a pyrex dish for 15 mins then turned the oven off and left the chicken in there for another 10-15 mins while the sides cooked. It was delicious and not dry at all. It's going in my virtual recipe box.",

It was a bit salty as I thought it would be so I think a low sodium soy sauce would work better. I juiced the lemon over the chicken mix before the final 5 minutes of cooking. Although this will not replace some of my favorite recipes for chicken stir-fry I will use it when time is short. Thanks!",
