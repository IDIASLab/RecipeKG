I didn't let the meat mixture cool enough, so it melted the cheese and split the dough. I rolled it over and put it in the freezer for 15 minutes, which helped. I had a hard time rolling it tight enough, so it kinda fell apart. I might try this again...maybe.",

Overall, a nice easy recipe with ingredients I always have on hand. Pretty cheap, too.
