He saw this one and tried it. My initial thought was that it looked like too few ingredients. I was wrong! We gobbled up this salsa and the flavor was fantastic. I disagree with the reviewer that said that it needed more ingredients to be tasty. I am a huge fan of Mexican / Tex Mex food so I've tasted hundreds of salsas. This one is really good. You can certainly add ingredients if you want to but it is not necessary.",

After it was finished I added some lemon juice minced garlic and a couple of seasonings. I would have also added cilantro if I had it. With the added flavorings it was better.
