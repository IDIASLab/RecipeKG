Also I mixed the pretzels in the white chocolate first then stirred in the colored candies to prevent the red and green candies from melting in the white and swirling it. I had no melting/swirling problems this way. After spreading on the baking sheet (9x13) I hand-inserted more red and green candies on top for color and then sprinkled the whole pan with red and green sugar sprinkles. Turned out great thank you!",
