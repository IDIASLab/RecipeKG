I used quartered cherry tomatoes which are naturally sweeter than others and one medium-sized green tomato which did help add a bit of crispness. The end result was fresh delicious and had a great kick. Oh and I also used 1 habanero 1 jalapeno. Really excellent.",

Based on my personal preferences here are some changes I made for the second time I made it which then came out perfect. I added tomatoes red and green bell peppers and used peach schnapps instead of the tequila. Also I don't like \"crunchy\" fruits or veggies in my salsa so I sauteed my onions and peppers and left out the firm peach just used canned peaches (I also use some of the syrup from the peaches to sweeten the salsa). Good stuff! You can use any \"leftover\" salsa to cook up some chicken and rice with for a fabulous meal.",
