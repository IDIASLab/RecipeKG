I didn't think my boyfriend would like cactus (nopales) and he could not get enough! We ate every last morsel. I rinsed the raw cactus beforehand and left out the jalapeno (just didn't feel like heat tonight). Eating it raw in this salad is really good and I've had it this way before. Didn't have time to let the flavors meld since it was last minute but it didn't matter because it was so flavorful fresh tasting and low calorie. We're trying to incorporate lowfat dishes in our diet so this was a heart-healthy surprise and I will make this many more times to come!",

I add chopped black olives and dress it with 1/4 c. each of EVOO & red wine vinegar. Chill well. Top with diced avocado and cojita cheese. Serve over lettuce leaves or a bed of field greens!
