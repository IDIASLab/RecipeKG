I served it over grilled Pacific Sea Bass and served it with a fresh salad from my garden. The ideal refreshing meal for summer!",

I also had to leave out the kiwi since I didn't have any and didn't want to run to the store for just kiwi. But I made due with homemade canned peaches and fresh strawberries cilantro and mint from the garden and the lime juice. The pinch of salt really helps to bring the flavors all together as I had forgotten it at the first taste and then added it after re-reading the recipe. This was the perfect light lunch as I was looking for something light and cool on this hot day and wanted a new way to use up some of our strawberries. I'm about to make a second batch for later!
