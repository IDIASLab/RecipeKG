Spooning them in its tedious so I put it in to a Ziploc bag,  cut the corner off, then squirt it in each cap (like a frosting cake thing). You can get in to all the corners of the cap and it's less mess and looks better. I also sprinkle shredded Parm on the tops before throwing them in the oven. Gives it that extra kick in the mouth. Finally,  when baking, I bake it on a broiler pan so they don't sit in all that juice. They are way less soggy this way and again, less mess.\nP.S. serve in a deviled egg dish. They fit perfectly!",
