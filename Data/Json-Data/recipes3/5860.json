I used miracle whip (1/4 C) and sour cream (1 C) instead of the mayo (makes it lighter and fluffier and adds zest) and regular mustard instead of Dijon. Also I didn't add the vinegar to the dressing but instead sprinkled it over the hot potatoes when they were done cooking. That way it soaks into the potatoes to give them more flavor. Also added diced onion and garlic powder along with some freshly ground pepper. Yummy!",
