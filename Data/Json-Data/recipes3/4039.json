Put the reserved juice  in a pan and reduced it slightly while sauting the garlic and onions to give it even more clam flavor. Used fat free half and half instead of milk and dry sherry instead of white wine.  Added 1 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  Left out the parsley, since I didn't ahave any and this didn't need the additional salt and pepper. I didn't have enough regular linguini so added some multi-grain that I had bought.   It was really good.  Topped it with a sprinkle of parmesan.  This is going in our regular dinner rotation as it's so easy to make.",
