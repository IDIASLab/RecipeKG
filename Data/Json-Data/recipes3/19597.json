I felt the raw spinach should have been precooked and drained before adding to the dish as I found it was not done while the cheese was rubbery and overcooked. I also added a layer of leftover dressing on the bottom. That did soak up the liguid from the spinach. Even w/ the faults listed my family liked the dish. I decided to do it again this time doing a layer of dressing smashed spuds precooked spinach chopped turkey and salt pepper and garlic powder. I baked it for 20 minutes and then added the cheese and cooked until it melted. It was very very good! I will keep messing w/ it but it's a good start!",

I had leftover turkey and fresh spinach on hand, so, after reading other reviews, I created what we thought was a great dish.\nI first sauteed some onion and garlic, then wilted the spinach over it to cook it a bit.  I also threw in some mushrooms that I had on hand.  Added salt & pepper to taste, and some fresh nutmeg gratings since I think nutmeg always goes with spinach.  I precooked some white rice (normally would have used brown, but didn't have enough time.\nI then mixed the rice with the spinach mixture(drain it if necessary), and mixed in the turkey.  I covered the dish and cooked for 25 min, then added the cheese, and cooked it another 10-15 min uncovered, to melt the cheese.\nWonderful. ",
