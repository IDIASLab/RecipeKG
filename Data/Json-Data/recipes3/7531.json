(He actually could not I.D. the blueberries at first--he was pushing them off to the side until I asked him about it--thought they were black olives!). I did make a few changes based on necessity. Resized the recipe to 10 so that I could use up 1 entire bag of romaine (which if you're curious yields 8 cups of lettuce if you dont squish it down). Used dried mixed berries instead of just dried cranberries. Used less blueberries than called for and extra dried berries--this was a choice based on price because I used fresh. I think I COULD have bought frozen blueberries thawed & drained them though because I don't really care if they stain my salad blue. Used all low-fat feta & no goat cheese. None of the above changes make any real difference overall. Except maybe the feta or sunflower seeds--you need one or both of those to cut the sweetness. The real changes I made were in the dressing. Used RED balsamic vinegar instead of WHITE because it's what I had. Used pancake syrup instead of real maple because it's what I had. Used olive oil instead of grapeseed oil because I couldn't find it at the grocery store. It was still tasty even with these substitutions. I mixed my dressing separately from my salad because the salad gets re-bagged and eaten all week and you can't do that with dressing all over it.",

Pretty presentation too for company if you get plenty of the dark green Romaine too in it.",

The only changes I made, and they didn't really alter the recipe, were that I used raspberries instead of blueberries b/c I don't really care for blueberries, and I didn't use goat cheese but I did use the feta.  Oh, and I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I did follow the dressing recipe exactly.  I really do think the grapeseed oil makes a difference, if you can find it.  It's not as strong of a flavor as olive oil.  And use real maple syrup if you can too.  I'm sure it would still be good with substitutions but definitely best if you follow the recipe.  ",

Make it in small quantities so it isn't in the fridge for more than a day. Or skip the feta and use a drizzle of lemon juice as your only dressing. The salad combination is quite good. The dressing seems too sweet. Perhaps if the maple syrup were halved and some of the balsamic switched out for white vinegar I would like it better.",
