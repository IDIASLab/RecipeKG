I tried this recipe because like another reviewer, my childhood experience with them was traumatizing and after fifty-seven years, now that I'm all grown up, time to try again.  At seven, I felt betrayed by Brussels sprouts.  I was told that we are having Brussels sprouts and they were one of my Grandma's favorites.  Then they arrived at the table looking like cute miniature cabbages.  What's not to like?  Well you know what happened!!! One bite, one bitter, probably over-boiled bite.  LOL.  I made this per the recipe except that I steamed the sprouts and shallots (couldn't find the cipollinis) in the skillet instead of boiling each separately, drained, put the skillet back on the burner for a few seconds to evaporate any water left in the bottom of the pan, added the butter, and proceeded per the recipe. I can safely say that they were the best Brussels sprouts I've ever eaten = ) I am giving five stars; I think this is a great recipe and method for cooking these little gems...but not sure I'm a convert!",
