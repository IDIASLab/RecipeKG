I roasted them in the oven at 400 degrees for 45 min. I sauteed 5-6 cloves garlic, 2 onions, and 1 green pepper until fragrant and translucent in a big sauce pan.  I then added 1 1/2 c fresh basil, 2-3 tsp oregano, and 2-3 tsp fresh rosemary.  I sauteed that for another min.  Then I placed the roasted tomatoes and all the juices in the sauce pan and simmered for 2 hours.  When the tomatoes broke down I added approx. 1 cup of vodka.  Simmered for another 1/2 hour and then I pureed the sauce.  I added a few sprinkles of dried oregano and parsley while the sauce was cooking.",
