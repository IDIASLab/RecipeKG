I was looking for a frosting that would stiffen up nicely so I changed it up slightly.  Instead of the 1/4c of milk, I used 1 large egg white & I doubled the powdered sugar to 2 cups.  I also add the juice of 1/2 lemon; it gives it a less \"powdery sugar\" flavor but does not overpower.  I'm a big fan of vanilla extract so I usually add a little of that too!  Stick to the clear vanilla extract if you want to keep the frosting white.  Add food color for color.  I found this combination to be good for decorating as well as \"flooding\".  To \"flood\", you will need to dilute frosting w/more egg white to thin it out.  Also, I use the liquid egg whites in the carton; no yolks to deal with & they're pasteurized, which makes them much safer to consume than traditional raw egg whites.",
