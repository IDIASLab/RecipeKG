                "reviewBody": "This waffle recipe really has a lot of potential. After reading a lot of the reviews I added 1T of sugar to the batter. I did not want bland tasting waffles. I used buttermilk and I beat the heck out of the egg whites until it was foamy frothy and stiff about 2 minutes. I added the egg whites to the batter and then the fresh blueberries last. I folded the blueberries gently into the batter. I scooped portions of the batter onto my waffle grill and cooked until it was golden brown. I ended up with 12 waffles. The waffle is pretty with the blueberries cooked right in. Some were oozing with its purple berry juices right out of the waffles- nice. The waffles itself tastes good with the addition of the sugar. However I strongly feel that the star of this recipe is the blueberry sauce! It is perfectly sweet with the right touch of honey and fresh blueberries. I love the addition of the fresh orange juice. The sauce is easy to prepare with a thick consistency. It is a smooth beautiful purple blueish color. Next time I may need to double the amount of sauce because it was just enough for 4 waffles. The waffles with blueberry sauce makes for a really nice presentation. Based on the original recipe I give it a 3 stars rating while my family's feedback is a 5 stars. With the addition of the 1T sugar plus the delicious blueberry sauce everyone raved about I feel it is more of a 4 star rating. I would make this again with my adjustments and even use the sauce for other recipes.",
