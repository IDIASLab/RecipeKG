I thickened the marinade with cornstarch after it was done cooking. It made a delicious gravy. I did not have liquid smoke but I don't think I would have liked it anyway and I only had one can of beef broth. I really don't think that two cans are necessary. I will definitely make this again.",

I had hoped for a little more flavor in the center of the meat so I sliced the leftovers and sealed them up in a container with the juices poured over the top. The next day the flavor was a lot more consistent. Next time I make this I will seal the marinated meat and the marinade in heavy foil place in a roaster and bake at 350 for about 4 hours as I do with another brisket recipe in hopes of working the flavor deeper into the meat. We will be trying this again - it's well worth the experimenting time!",
