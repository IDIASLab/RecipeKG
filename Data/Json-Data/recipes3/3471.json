Ever since I was a kid my mom never used a recipe but made peppers without precooking everything. This was the only recipe I could find that did not ask you to do that. She thought I was nuts to precook all my ingredients. I used this recipe for the amounts. I used uncle Bens converted rice and added one egg to the meat mixture. I also added italian seasoning along with the salt (must be kosher or sea salt huge difference!)and pepper. I used 85% lean ground beef. I had enourmous peppers (i used 4) so I halved them and layed them in a deep baking dish. Instead of tomato sauce I used 2 jars of marinara and 1 jar of water. I poured them over the stuffed peppers and loosly covered the baking pan. I baked it at 300 for 3 to 3 1/2 hours. They came out perfect! My baking dish was stoneware so I do not know if that makes a difference but it was great! The peppers were not way overcooked at all. Try it this way. It is soooo easy! Thanks!",

It WILL bake fully in the oven.  If you cook the meat before you will lose all the needed flavor! You do cook the rice, then chopped onion, Italian Seasoning, a little garlic and pepper. Mix this all together with the meat add to peppers. I would have given this 5* but you do not have Tomato Soup. If you use this instead of the Juice,it has much more flavor.",

But my husband mopped up every bit off his plate with bread and we thought it was an ideal winter comfort food. We even got our 9 year old to eat it when we omitted the onions. It was very fast and easy to put together. I loved that we could skip precooking of the rice and browning of the beef but did not like having to cook the onions. To save time I melted the butter in the microwave stirred in the chopped onion and nuked it until translucent. If you use converted rice you can put it all together and pack it into a crockpot on low for 7-10 hours. Use only half the liquid and pour it over the tops of the peppers. Top with your favorite cheese just before serving. I tried it with pasta sauce and tomato soup instead of juice with good results. I have also substitued any combination of bits of garlic corn kernels celery carrots or cooked beans for all or part the onion when onion haters came to dinner.",

I also used a large can of tomato sauce and added about 1 1/2 large cans of water. (I used the can of sauce to measure) I cooked on medium for about 2 hours. (a more current review)-when I posted the previous info I did not write if I used instant rice or not. Recently I used this recipe again but with reg. rice and like previous posters the rice on top was crunchy while the bottom was mush and the pepper was so soft it fell apart by the time it was done cooking. USE INSTANT that's what I must have used the first time and had wonderful success. I usually use instant for everything but I was out this time. INSTANT RICE IS KEY!",

And the instructions could be better. It took me awhile to figure that this is done on the stovetop and it doesn't specify whether to use \"minute rice\" or regular rice. I used jasmine rice figuring that cooking for 3 hours would cook it - wrong. After 2 hours the rice on the top was still crunchy so I had to tip them over to try to get them in the sauce enough to cook the rice even though I was basting them every 15-20 minutes. And I didn't know if I should cook them covered or not. I left the lid on thinking that would help the rice nope. Oddly the rice that was deep in the pepper got horribly mushy.",
