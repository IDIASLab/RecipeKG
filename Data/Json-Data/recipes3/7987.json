It had great reviews and enticing ingredients. But I should have paid more attention to the high ratio of eggs to flour because if I had I probably could have predicted that not only is this not batter bread it s not bread at all. The texture is very eggy and has no crumb. It smelled good as it was baking and it tasted good too. But this is more like an oven omelet so for that reason alone this recipe was very disappointing.",
