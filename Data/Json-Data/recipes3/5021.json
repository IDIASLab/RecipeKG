I think this will be my burger recipe until my arteries plug up anyway:) The butter really adds some juiciness to the seemingly tasteless ground beef I find in the stores these days. I did lower the butter to about 1 teaspoon per 5 oz patty. Next time I will up the rosemary to about 1/4 teaspoon of dried leaves per burger. Thanks so much for sharing BURQUEBOI!

I was looking for a little something different to jazz up our burgers so used a lean meat to off set the fat content with using the butter. It could be we just don't care for the taste of butter in our burgers. And I do like butter vs. oil in a lot of dishes that I cook just not our burgers. I would rather use a higher ratio of fatty ground beef for flavor than butter. I must say though that I will play around a little bit with the rosemary and some other spices to perk up our burgers a little more for flavor in the future. Thanks for the post.",
