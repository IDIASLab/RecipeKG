I halved the recipe and used about 3 cups of frozen broccoli (after running it through the microwave for a few minutes it was reduced to about 2 1/2 cups). I also used 1/2 cup of Panko crumbs (instead of stale bread) sauted with the butter until golden. The sauce was very good and I would recommend this recipe. Very nice and smooth and tasty. Thanks so much for the recipe. I will use it again!",
