I was concerned because there were little bits of marzipan that didn't mix completely with the butter but once cooked the small pieces had melted and incorporated with the filling. I personally wasn't crazy about the texture of the cooked pears and thought the pie was too sweet. My husband however loved the pie. I think I might like it better with a cherry filling instead of pear. We did try the pie room temperature and cold after refrigerating and both agreed we liked the pie better cold.",
