For one thing, all the shrimp flavor is getting boiled or soaked out in water!  Here's what I did:  put the shrimp, tails off, in a shallow pan and season with some lemon juice and black pepper while you do the rest (boil pasta water, mince garlic, etc.).  When the pasta goes into the water, add the shrimp to a hot skillet with olive oil and butter.  Cook it til pink, turning -- add the minced garlic when you're about two minutes away from done.  Then drain the pasta and THEN combine THAT garlic-infused butter and oil and shrimp with the pasta, top with FRESH parsley, black pepper and cheese (and a hint of cayenne, if you want).",
