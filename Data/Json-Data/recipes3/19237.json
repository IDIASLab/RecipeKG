Now, don't think it's supposed to look and taste like KFC. Deep fried and pan fried produce two very different types of chicken. This had a thin, crisp coating and was nice and juicy inside. I don't have a lid for my skillet so I just used aluminum foil. I do think the seasoning is a bit bland. I served this with creamy gravy I made from the drippings. I will use this method again. Anybody can do it and it didn't even make a mess! Really.",

Otherwise I followed these instructions and finally I have made chicken as good as my Grandma's! I always look for fried chicken recipes but they usually use bread crumbs and other stuff. I couldn't find one that was simple like this, just like my Grandma makes hers. So a million thank you's for this! Every single one of my three kids and my husband devoured this.  I'm 30 years old and this is the first time I've actually successfully fried chicken...I'm a real grown up now!!",
