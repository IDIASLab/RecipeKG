I put a little oil in a pan and browned the bottoms of them and then added broth (beef was my first choice but I only had chicken) to cover about 1/4 inch of the ravioli and cover them and steam until liquid is gone.  If you don't like Chorizo, taco meat would work great.  I want to try them with ground turkey or chicken taco meat next.",
