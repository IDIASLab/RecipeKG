If you crave chocolate, use \"Butter Recipe Chocolate\" cake mix. Also, bake time is roughly 30 min., take out while the cake is still jiggly and slightly oozes. ENJOY!!!",

I was able to cut it into bars that kept they're shape, on the 2nd day. \r\n\r\nBefore I made this, and after reading the reviews, someone suggested a fruit topping might be good w/ it.  Remembering that I had some frozen blueberries, I took them out and mixed them w/ some sugar and a squeeze of lemon juice, and let that set while I prepared the batter.  After it was done baking and while it cooled, the blueberries became a nice syrupy topping!  So while the bars were still warm, I topped it w/ a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and then the blueberries, and the combination of the three came out PERFECT.  The presentation came out better too, than it would have if I just served the bars alone. I had my in-laws over, and they just LOVED it!  Will definitely make this one again.",
