It surprised me how much we all liked it although my youngest girlies didn't like the mushrooms nor the tomatoes but since it called for whole canned tomatoes they were simple to avoid. Sauce was a bit on the watery side but serving over rice allowed by maximum absorption. (Wow why was that word so hard to spell?)",

The chicken is then browned in the flavored oil. Chicken broth Italian tomatoes wine parsley 2-3 chopped garlic thyme bay leaf is added and chicken simmered for 45 min- to an hour. Chicken removed to a baking dish. The liquid is simmered and reduced for 10 min. Then sliced fresh mushrooms and pearl onions are sauteed in 1/4 cup of real butter and fresh lemon juice. This is poured over the chicken along with the reduced liquid a drained can of sliced black olives and finally a jigger (or 2!) of brandy is poured over all. Heat in over for about 30 min. Serve with white rice and crusty french bread. Ooooo-lah-lah!",
