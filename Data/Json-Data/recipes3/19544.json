We like spicy and this gave it more of a kick -- next time I might just use all pepper jack. To serve, I used the idea I had gotten from another site. Divided it up into oven-safe bowls and topped with puffed pastry. Cut rounds from sheets of puffed pastry slightly larger than the bowls, brush edges with beaten egg, invert rounds onto filled bowls and press edges to sides to seal. Brush tops and refrigerate an hour.  Place bowls on baking sheet and bake in 400 degree oven for 30 minutes or until golden and puffed. Makes an impressive presentation for soups and chowders!!",

I added a chopped carrot to the onions when I sauted them. As others said it looked way way too thick. I used about 1.5 cups 2% milk and 1.5 cups whole milk-- then after seeing how thick it was I probably added about 3 cups water. For the corn I used 1 fresh corn cob (shaved off the cob obviously) and a big bag of frozen corn. And only one can of cream corn- that's all I had. Added a tsp. of sugar. When I added the corn to the soup I also added a cut up potato and added colby shredded cheese-- but only at the last few minutes. Sounds like a lot of changes but it really wasn't too different from the original and it was really good. And by the way- I made this all with my 3 year old helping.. he washed all the vegetables (he spent about 10 minutes on each one:).",

I also threw in more veggies (e.g. celery mushrooms) as well as some shrimp. A previous poster suggested adding sour cream before eating the soup. I tried that it was much yummier!",

I added a bit more cayenne pepper than was called for-- very sinus clearing! And like many people I added two decent sized diced potatoes to the mix. I left out the sherry and it was fine.
