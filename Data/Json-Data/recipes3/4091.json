However when I tasted the cheese sauce before adding it to the casserole dish I found it to be really lacking in flavor so I added parmesan cheese paprika a 1/2 tsp of curry powder a few dashes of worcestire sauce and a small handful of fresh oregano from my garden. That helped alot! I also used fresh cauliflower - about a half a head chopped in big pieces and scattered on top! Nice flavor and smelled great while cooking!",

The flavor wasn't bad but instead of cornflakes usted french fried onions.
