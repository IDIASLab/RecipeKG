It all depends on the age of your beans they type of water you use and the altitude. So to make sure they always turn out well add the seasonings with salt after they become soft. I took out the beer and reserved some of the cilantro tomatoes & jalapenos to add to each bowl while serving and this became my family's favorite.",
