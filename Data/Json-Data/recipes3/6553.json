As written, there are a couple of problems. First, if you brown your chicken breasts until they are 'no longer pink in the center,' they are DONE; any additional cooking time is overcooking them. I chose to call them done and pour the finished sauce over them, skipping the baking step. Second, there is not enough sauce for 8 chicken breasts. Double it if you are making that many. Finally, I think this recipe is a little involved for the final product. The finished sauce did not bowl me over. It's good - definitely edible, but not something I want to spend an hour making. Browned chicken breasts, bottled vodka sauce, sour cream, and feta would give you arguably more flavorful results in about 20 minutes. Again, my husband and son loved it so thanks for the recipe! ",

I made whole wheat penne pasta and added it to the casserole dish for serving. What a combnation!! This chicken and sauce are so tender and flavorful. This was a wonderful change from typical chicken dishes. Everyone raved about this!! Served with whole wheat penne pasta a loaf of French bread and any green vegetable you choose this is the perfect meal..Yum!!!!! Thank you so much for this recipe. We loved it! UPDATE: This recipe should come with a warning. I have many other recipes that are waiting to be tested but I am having serious cravings to make this again instead. It is so good that you will go through withdrawl and crave it again and again-lol.",

My judging criteria: \"normal\" ingredients ease pf prep and cooking of the recipe and of course if the whole family loves the outcome. This recipe blew away all the criteria! Easy to make with only having to buy a few ingredients and seriously the whole family really did LOVE it. I did double the sauce but only used 4 chicken breasts to start because I didn't want to waste more chicken if it was bad. (Needless to say I cooked more chicken to go with the rest of the sauce) Other than doubling the sauce followed recipe exactly. Loved the tang that the feta gave the sauce the garlic and onion still had texture and the tomato paste gave it just enough acidity to balance the richness of the sour cream and feta. The vodka was undetectable to me hubby said he tasted it. (I used a cheaper brand of vodka) Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and french bread. Hubby thought the sauce would be a good \"dip\" for the bread as an app-will try that idea out at my work party this week:) Thank you so much Trudy for an awesome NEW chicken recipe for us!!!!!",
