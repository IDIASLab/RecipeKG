                "reviewBody": "Liked this salad, but there are a few things that I would do differently in the future.  I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings which called for 1 large shredded carrot...too much for us, would cut the carrot amount in half.  Personal taste preference, but I think dried cranberries would be a good option to the raisins, and they would give the salad a little pop of color.  Instead of mixing the raisins (or cranberries) and peanuts into the salad, I would plate the salad and then garnish with these two items, as they just fall to the bottom of the salad bowl.  You need to be a serious arugula lover to thoroughly enjoy this salad.  I wonder if a blend of spinach and arugula might be more palatable to many folks, as the arugula on its own is very peppery.  Nice dressing, and right amount, as it didn\u2019t drench the salad itself.  Also, I would add the zest to the dressing, not to the salad itself, as I think it will be better distributed in the salad.  This easily could be changed into a main course salad with the addition of some grilled shrimp or chicken.",
