I agree with all the other comments that 5 minutes is way too long for searing the tuna. 1-2 minutes per side is more like it. The tuna got cold while making the sauce unfortunately but a quick trip to the microwave before pouring the sauce on fixed that. Squeezed a couple of blood oranges but not enough for 2 cups so I mixed it with regular orange juice. Again turned out delicious!",

The tuna was wonderful although I lightly salted and peppered the steaks then seared in olive oil. I could not find blood oranges (Limited Selection at military commissary) so I used orange juice with a little bit of lime and lemon juice and some sugar along with the white wine and a pat of butter with chopped shallot and garlic. It was a little sour but that Im sure is just becaus of the lemon/lime. When I find the blood oranges or juice I will try again because it sounds so delisicous. And in contradiction to the last review I seared the tuna for about 3 - 4 minutes on one side and 2 - 3 on the other. IT wasnt flaky at all just delicious.",
