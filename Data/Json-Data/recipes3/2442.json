I used pork chops instead of pork loin cutlets because loin is smaller and less plentiful and also, can be more expensive.  Chops do the job just as well, you may just have to add more prep time by removing the bone and/or extra fat.  If the chops are too thick, you can pound them out or cut them thinner.  With my honey mixture, I added a bit of brown sugar and used walnuts instead of pecans. (I would even try some almonds!)  Warming the honey makes the dish less heavy - very appetizing.",

I seasoned them well with salt, pepper, garlic powder and non-MSG tenderizer before I dredged them in flour.\n\nI melted 2 TBLS butter with some olive oil and sauteed a small chopped onion and 2 cloves of chopped garlic. I removed those then well browned the chops. After I got them going I put a lid on them to get a nice brown crust. I then removed the chops to a covered square casserole dish. I put the onions and garlic back in the browning pan, added 1/4C real maple syrup, 1/3C chicken broth (if I had a non-citrus juice, I would have used that) & a splash of soy sauce and scaped up all the chop drippings. When that boiled I poured it over the chops, then sprinkled them with half the chopped pecans. \n\nI cooked them covered in the oven @ 350 fo about 30-40 min. I basted the chops with the liquid about half way through. After that initial 30-40 min, I removed the lid, basted again, sprinkled the rest of the pecan on top then cooked for 15 min more. At that point I removed most of the liquid to a small sauce pan and cooked the chops another 15 min. I boiled the liquid until it reduced by half and served it with the chops at the table.\n\nMy husband loved this dish. I think this would make a great & beautiful \"company\" dish. I think next time,  instead of maple syrup, I may try a fruit syrup. \n\nIt DID occur to me that this is very similar to the way I cook 'holiday' yams!",
