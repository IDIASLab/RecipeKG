I used onion instead of leeks and used about 2 cups. I absolutely think that the Italian sausage makes this recipe, so if you can make it that way I highly recommend it. I added the broth last pouring a little over one cup over the ingredients in each pan then used a spatula to press the broth into the stuffing. I covered the pans and let the stuffing sit for about 30 mins and then baked as directed. One comment was it has a gourmet flavor, another had leftovers for breakfast because they absolutely loved it and everyone basically just raved about it. Thank you so much for this recipe that made this Thanksgiving so special!!!!!!!!!!Peggy in Texas",

I was worried about the large amount of leeks in the recipe, but they were an excellent addition to the recipe and cooked down considerably.  I did use turkey sausage as the recipe submittor suggested.  I also used dried cherries instead of cranberries.  About 3/4s of a 1-pound loaf of white bread produced 12 cups of bread cubes called for in the recipe, which I toasted briefly in my oven as it preheated.  This looked elegant on the table - very impressive.  I baked it alone, rather than stuffing my bird, so I used just a bit extra chicken broth.",

I've never been one to put sausage in my dressing...it just seemed too \"unhealthy,\" but is it ever great! Because I like the convenience, I substitute Pepperidge Farm Seasoned Bread Cubes (any type or combination...white/wheat/cornbread) for the do-it-yourself white bread cubes. Therefore, I don't add any poultry seasoning...but don't leave out the rosemary! \n\nHere's the one problem I've had with this recipe each time...how much chicken stock to use? Since I make it as dressing (not stuffing, which goes inside the bird), it comes out VERY dry with only 1 and 1/3 cans. This time I went to three cans, but I can't seem to get the amount quite right...it was still somewhat dry. \n\nDespite my \"liquid dilemma,\" this has been the most complimented on and most requested holiday recipe I've ever used...other than my Bourbon Cranberries!",

It seemed like an awful lot of onion but once it was cooked it tasted great. Because the feast was at lunch time I made this the night before and heated it the next day. If anything I think it improved the flavor because it all had time to meld together. Just remember to factor in extra baking time if you do this. It really took quite a while for all that cold stuffing to heat up. However it would be nice to be able to make this the night before Thanksgiving and just heat it up on Thanksgiving leaving more time for all those other dishes that need your attention.",
