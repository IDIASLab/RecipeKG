I used a cup of each, and used olive instead of canola oil.  I also added 1 tsp. of white sugar.  They were a little crumbly, but no more than your average drop biscuit.  My son LOVED them, and they were great with the chicken and rice soup I made.  Oh.  I used regular 1% milk too.  I'm not vegan, so soy milk just isn't in the pantry!  Thanks for the recipe!",

The amount of milk the conversion gave as well as the baking powder wasn't quite enough. I liked it and the kids seemed to as well tho my husband requested the 1/2 white flour next time. This is the first whole wheat recipe I enjoyed. Please note my biscuits didn't rise with just whole wheat flour but they were still a nice consistancy. Looked like rocks but not hard!",
