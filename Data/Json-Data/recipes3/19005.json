Being from MD I put in butter and old bay instead of the lemon and that was a great more traditional flavor for me. I also made a variation with butter and Franks Red Hot sauce and I had Buffalo Shrimp! I did leave the Buffalo Shrimp cook for 45 minutes, but anytime from 30 min to 1 Hr works fine with the shrimp. Sous Vide all the way!",
