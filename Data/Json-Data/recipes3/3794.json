Amount of milk you add determines how thin or thick your sauce is and skim mixes just as well as cream or homo milk. Melt the butter then wisk in the flour and add milk. Cook on high for about 3-4 minutes stirring every minute. Add the cheese and heat again for 1-2 minutes until the cheese melts into the white sauce. No lumps!!",

I think THE SECRET IS that I make it with Parmesan cheese and I crushed up Stove Top chicken stuffing in my blender for the topping. I also used 14 oz can chicken broth replacing some of the milk. I did not add as much milk I stirred it in as needed for the proper thickness allowing for it to thicken during baking. I put the vegetables in rows so if someone does not like one or the other they can pick around it. I did not add the cayenne or the mustard but I may try it in a smaller batch before I serve it to anyone else. HUGE hit. Every response is that it is a nice change up from the old green been casserole standby",
