I did change things a little...I sauted the onion in a little butter and olive oil until tender, and then added the mushrooms (I used fresh - 1/2 sliced white button and 1/2 sliced baby bellas) and sauted those until all moisture was gone and then added the minced garlic and sauted for 2 minutes. I then deglazed with the white wine and allowed to simmer until the pan was almost dry. This mixture was removed from the pan and set aside and the ground beef was added to the pan and browned. Then the mushroom mixture added back in.  I mixed the flour with 1/2 cup of beef stock and added that to the skillet and then 2 cans of mushroom soup and 1.5 the amount of beef broth (I used stock) called for in the recipe and a splash of Worcestershire. (Also seasoned with Salt and Pepper along the way). Allowed this to simmer for approx. 10 - 15 min and served over wide egg noddles. Very tasty weenight dinner.",
