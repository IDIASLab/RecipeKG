Since I wanted to make it right away I didn't soak the beans overnight. Instead I rinsed the beans and covered with water and brought to a boil. I let them boil for 2 minutes and then turned off the heat and left them covered for 1 hr. I then strained the beans and added fresh water. I couldn't find \"smoked\" turkey legs so I bought the fresh legs that were available. I made a sauce out of Lea & Perrins white wine sauce for Chicken a few drops of liquid smoke and a pinch of Italian seasoning. We grilled the turkey legs on the bbq coated with the sauce first. After a about 20 minutes I added the legs to the beans. I also added one can of chicken broth and didn't use as much water. Will make this soup many times!",

I also just used 1 smoked turkey leg and that was plenty! I also used rotel tomatoes, garlic powder and some red pepper flakes.I used somewhat less than 2 Tb. of italian seasoning- but I think this is what helps MAKE this soup!  I think this is the best bean soup I have ever made!My husband agrees:) We do love our dried beans- I think this is so much better than using ham- saw the smoked turkey legs and wings at the store and bought them for either greens or beans.
