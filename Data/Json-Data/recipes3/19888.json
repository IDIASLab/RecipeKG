To make up for the missing cheese we sliced up a bit of regular sharp cheddar. 2)We used rainbow rotini pasta. 3)We added some instant minced onion while we were browning the beef (I always do!). Even though we halved the recipe and used a small baking dish we couldn't see how to layer everything twice. We ended up just layering the pasta beef sauce then cheese only ONCE. We were skeptical on how it would taste but we actually liked it more than we thought we would! We both agreed we would make it again. My husband was the one to take it out of the oven and he mentioned that as he was scooping it out it was rather watery on the bottom (I didn't get the chance to look). I wonder if it was from the sauce. The ingredients say spaghetti sauce but the directions say tomato sauce. If you use spaghetti sauce I would suggest getting a quality brand - good and thick! We may add some garlic to the browning beef next time! Good recipe! Easy and quick!",

You can use the hamburg or 1 pound italian sausage cooked and crumbled. You can use your own sauce or make the one that comes with the recipe: 1-15oz.can tomato sauce(2 cups) 1/2 tsp. of each garlic salt pepper and dried basil. Cook on stovetop together with your meat. About 10-15 min. Use 1 1/2 cups cream style cottage cheese 1 1/2 cups cubed velveeta and 7- 8 0z. cooked elbow macaroni. Same directions as this only add cottage cheese in dollups on top of layers. I have never tried it with ricotta cheese but bet it would be good also. Should have 3 layers ending with the sauce a cheese layer on top. This is the way we enjoy it and why I gave it 5 stars.
