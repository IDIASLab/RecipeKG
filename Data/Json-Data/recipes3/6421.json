After reading other reviews I used 6 romas & added a 6oz can of tomato paste (and about 2tbsp water to dilute that). I also added a can of chopped basil & oregano tomatoes just because I had it in the pantry; will try without next time. Served over whole wheat pasta.. DELICIOUS! I am convinced that I'll never buy pasta sauce again because this recipe is a great base to add-on to and make my own healthier and homemade version!",

I also added a third cup of mushrooms a can of tomato sauce 2 tbs garlic 3 cups bell peppers and 4 sliced sausages (since I can't do without meat). Then I let it simmer for 45 mins to let all the flavors blend nicely. It was a hit with my family and even though there was so much sauce it all got eaten.
