They must be using a really cheap, watery balsamic.  I would recommend investing in a really good balsamic, only using about 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup and reducing it a little with NO honey. A good balsamic will be sweet enough and rich enough on it's own. It's better to just reduce it a little in order to thicken it so that it sticks to the tomatoes and mozzarella.  Wonderful.",
