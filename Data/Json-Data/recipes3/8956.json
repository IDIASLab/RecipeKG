The only difference is we add some dill pickle juice to the mayonnaise mixture before adding it to the potatoes, eggs and green onions.  My mother-in-law always used 5 pounds of red potatoes, one dozen eggs and close to two bunches of green onions (green parts only).  The mayo-mustard, salt and pepper were never measured.   I followed your recipe using 5 pounds of potato but added a lot more mustard than listed (I USED TWO TABLESPOONS, AS WE LIKE IT TO HAVE SOME ZIP).  IT WAS FANTASTIC!

I didn't quite measure all the salt/pepper, also added a smidge more mustard because it seemed really mayo-ey when I tried the sauce. **to anyone who has a hard time cooking potatoes perfectly (I always made them too mushy), a trick my mother-in-law taught me is to boil them with the skins on just until a fork can penetrate without too much force, then put them in the fridge for a bit to cool, peel and dice. I am tossing any other potato salad recipes I have as I will use this one ALL the time.  ;o]",
