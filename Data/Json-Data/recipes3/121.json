This looked very easy so I tried it without reading the reviews.  I was not very happy with their appearance - the parmesan is not very attractive when mixed with the oil as it sits on the black olives.  BUT, they tasted delicious and were a big hit once someone took the plunge and tried them.\nI served them 2 ways -- as the recipe states and also with some added green olives, just for color.  I added extra large pimento stuffed green olives and garlic stuffed olives (store bought, from a jar).  I think this looked a bit more appetizing than the plain black olives, and appealed to those who were not black olive lovers.",
