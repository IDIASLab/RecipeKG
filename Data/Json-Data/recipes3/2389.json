Also a wonderful addition to the dinner table as a dipping for hot crusty bread this yummy concoction will make you forget all about that boring butter cube! You may even begin to believe you've been transported to a European Salt-o-the-Earth household if it's served complete with a hearty pasta and bottle of chianti! For my second mixing I changed it around a bit. I upped the quantity to make a cup and a half (3 parts olive oil 2 parts balsamic vinegar and 1 part purified water) as the guys in our house were practically trying to drink it out of the jar!! Also I did throw in a bit of granulated garlic (use your taste-buds to judge the right amount for you). It was heard said from the proximity of the couch that someone doesn't know what they're going to tell Mr. Newman!;)",

I sampled it before putting on a salad and I did decide to add about 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of roasted garlic (made by slicing the top off a garlic bulb drizzling with olive oil and sprinkling with salt wrapping in foil and roasting for about 45 minutes at 400 degrees; when cooled squeeze the soft caramelized garlic cloves out of the bulb). The dressing was good to begin with but just perfect for my taste after the additions. As petty as it may seem I didn't care for the color it turned the salad: a brownish color. It looked like spoiled lettuce despite the good taste. I believe firmly in the importance of presentation so this was a turn off to me. I think when I use it again I will try white wine vinegar instead of balsamic to alleviate the problem. Surprisingly the dressing was enough for a salad that served 4 one more than the recipe says. Altogether a good recipe-- glad I found it!",
