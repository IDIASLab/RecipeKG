You get a lot of the OJ flavor, just a hint of the banana, and the zucchini contributes its green  color, but no flavor.  This actually was pretty good, but I think in the future, I\u2019ll add more banana to bring that flavor up to share more equally with the orange juice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

Honey or a packet of Splenda would definitely help if I was having a sweet tooth. I really like the ice added to this. I thought the smoothie was filling, yet refreshing. Thanks!",
