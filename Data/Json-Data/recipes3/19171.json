Although I used italian bread crumbs, I added some other spices such as oregano and rosemary, since some people complained that it turned out too bland.  Lastly, I added the cheese (I used swiss) during the last ten minutes of baking.  Served with fettucine.  DELICIOUS!!  I will difinitly make again, and again, and again, and again......",

I have tried both canned and fresh... both turn out well. I also never add the cheese until the last 3-5 min. of baking time. One time, I forgot to add the cheese at the end so I made up a plate, put the sliced cheese on top and melted it in the microwave. My husband preferred the cheese this way as it was not so runny. I think from now on, I'll just melt the cheese on the chicken through the microwave. Also, with the runny sauce at the end, I thicken it up with a bit of cornstarch. This sauce/gravy is perfect on rice. This recipe has been added to the family favorites. Thanks so much for the recipe!",

I did use way more mushrooms then called for since everyone in my family loves them...I also used powdered chicken bouillon in place of the chicken broth and seasoned the chicken a bit for extra flavor.  I made about 2 cups of the bouillon (maybe more) removed the chicken from the baking pan when done and thickened it with some corn starch which made a fabulous gravy.  I also waited to the last 5 minutes or so to put the cheese on.  I served this with white rice and my family absolutely loved it...very moist and tender.  The only request from my family was more gravy next time since it was so delicious over the rice.  Next day leftovers (only 1 piece) was also delicious.  As an added note, I sauteed the mushrooms in some olive oil first.  When I made this a second time, I didn't saute them and it really didn't turn out anything like the first time.  I ended up taking the mushrooms out of the baking pan and sauteed them and then put them back in the baking pan (didn't come out as good as the 1st time, but it would have been horrible otherwise).  I finally realized I could update my review (thank goodness) because I wouldn't have given the review I originally did...",

This definately needs to be \"kicked up a notch\" will make again but will saute mushrooms(large sliced ones) a little first in butter garlic and wine then remove to the pan you are using for the oven. Then saute the breaded chicken in the same pan using a little more butter garlic and wine. Also I think you should use a salted mozarella cheese.",

I also like a stronger cheese, so in addition to the mozzarella, I added some asiago slices too. I put the cheese on the top 15 minutes into the baking time and let it get brown and bubbly. Even my VERY picky 2 year old ate this. Husband says it's a keeper. Both of those make this a winner in my book...",

Start out by pounding the chicken to about 1/3 in thickness OR slice it in strips 3. Used Italian bread crumbs and added about 1/4 cup of parmesan, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, and a few sprinkles of Italian seasoning. 3. Saute the mushrooms with 1 Tbsp. olive oil, 1/2 cup choppped onion, 1/2 Tbsp. of garlic (or one minced clove), and a few splashes of worcestershire sauce. 5. Like everyone else said, make sure to add a can of cream of mushroom to it. Summary: Otherwise follow the recipe as stated. I know this seems like its a bunch of added steps, but once you get going it doesn't seem like such a burden. This was really easy and fairly quick. Also I served it over ORZO pasta. NOTE: If you want to stick with a garlic theme, I highly recommend making it with \"garlic cauliflower\" found on this website.",
