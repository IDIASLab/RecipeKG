They're cream to pale yellow with green stripes, and their flesh is orange, slightly sweet and smooth but not stringy. My sister suggested the lime butter topping (my personal favorite), but a blend of maple syrup and butter is good, too. The squash usually aren't very big, so plan half a squash per person.",

This is NOT the kind of vegetable that tastes good mashed up with vanilla, cream and cinnamon like pumpkin or sweet potato - (believe me, I tried cooking many ways this morning)The lime and spice bring out the flavor the best. You can add a dash of cayenne if you like. Had to upload my picture after cooking -  Thanks! P.S. The SEEDS are great too. I rinsed and dried them, then baked at 275 for about 30 min. Next, heat up a tsp or less of olive oil in a pan and add lime juice, salt, chili and cayenne pepper to taste. Mix in your seeds and cook for a minute or less. Spread on paper towel and allow to dry before storing.",
