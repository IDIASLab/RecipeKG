Here are the changes I made:  Put olive oil in large stew pot, chopped up 1 large sweet onion and sauteed till golden.  Added in 3 lbs of liver, paprika, salt and pepper.  When doing this to season to taste you must season to your taste.  I used quite a bit of paprika and pepper.  I also added in garlic powder since I make Beef Stroganoff quite often and I like the flavor it gives.  After I cooked it down I added 1 can of cream of chicken soup mix per pound of livers.  This thickened it up quite a bit too.  Just before serving I added 1 16oz container of fat free sour cream.  We had ours over rice.  I don't like cooking too much with wine or alcohol that is why I used the cream of chicken soup.  Thanks for the great recipe.",

The consistency was fine for me too (a concern in earlier reviews) but if you like a thicker \"stick-together\" sauce you could easily thicken it a bit by sprinkling a little flour before adding the wine & sour cream. I love chicken livers but I think this would be equally good with other meats of your choice. Something different and a keeper. Thanks!",
