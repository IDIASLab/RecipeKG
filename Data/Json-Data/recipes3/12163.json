The chicken was moist and flavorful and the oven time was just right. I drained my tomato after chopping and I wish I had pressed it a bit to take out even more moisture. I let the spinach cook a bit long while waiting for the liquid to evaporate. As a result the spinach was over-cooked for my taste. I also wished for some minced garlic in the spinach. This recipe makes a lot of gravy too! As you can see from my photo I rolled three chicken breasts and there was plenty of stuffing and gravy to spare. I added the cooking juices from the chicken about 1/2 cup to the gravy and it was still quite thick. The ratio of flour to liquid seemed a bit off. This was my first time to use Lactaid and I could not tell that it was not milk. Overall this was a good main dish which I served with green beans and a baked sweet potato. Thanks for the recipe!",

It would be delicious that way. I cooked the chicken 40 minutes and it was tender and moist. I really liked the simple filling inside the rolled chicken. The gravy was good too...a little thick but I could have easily thinned it using more Lactaid milk. This is easy enough for everyday yet fancy enough for company.",
