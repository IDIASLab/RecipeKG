I made it with sauteed chicken breasts and linguine.  Absolutely wonderful, this will go into my Favorite Sauces catagory!  I doubled the recipe so I had enough to coat the 3 chicken breasts and the pasta and it was wonderful!!  Great recipe, this should not be labeled as just a seafood sauce, because it was excellent on chicken and pasta!!  THANK YOU!!!",

After I finished it and tasted it I decided to add one tablespoon of heavy cream to cut down the acidity for my husband. He loved every bite he took. I used chicken tenders cooked in olive oil with a touch of butter for this meal and we have enough left over for a sandwich today. I'll take part of the sauce and mix it with the mayo for the sandwich. We can hardly wait! I can see why this would be perfect for a porous white fish because the flavors would seep into it so perfectly. Next time! I'm glad I pulled this recipe from my oldest entry page of my recipe box (a challenge from mis7up a Recipe Buzzer). UPDATE: We did have a delicious sandwich using the leftovers today. This fits our definition of delicious. I understand that others may not like the taste of tarragon but YUM!",

The kids complained that it needed more flavor, but I think it was because of my substitutions.  I do think that I might go a little heavier on the garlic and tarragon next time.  When I added the parsley, I also added raw, peeled and deveined shrimp and stirred to coat.  When the shrimp was cooked, I poured everything over a bowl of thin spaghetti, tossed and served.  Even though the kids made that initial comment, I did notice that there were no leftovers, and that is my gauge of a good recipe!",
