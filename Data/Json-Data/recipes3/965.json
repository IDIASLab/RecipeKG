To thin out the peanut butter mixture I added just a splash of milk (1-2 T).   I also used  about 4 cups of heavy whipping cream instead of the frozen stuff, I think it has a better flavor and consistancy for this recipe.  After that was whipped up I folded it into the peanut butter mixture and filled the pie shell.  Wonderful recipe!  Hope these suggestions help out!  Thanks for sharing.",

Also my filling came out pretty fluffy.. if it doesn't maybe the problem is your folding technique? When I put the filling in the pie shell it looked really empty so I made another batch of filling and made a nice full pie (it was overkill though - too much to fit in the pie shell). I think next time I'll just put the rest of the tub of cool whip on top and then top that with the peanuts.. it'll look nicer fill out the pie and cut down on the richness. I would have given this recipe 5 stars if those had been the instructions. Oh - I also added mini chocolate chips to the top for a little different flavor. This is an update since I first wrote this review.. I looked back at my recipe and saw that I had written down 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of 1/3.. not a huge difference but that could be why it was very peanut-buttery.",

After spreading the filling into the graham cracker crust I drizzled a little chocolate syrup over the pie before sprinkling with the chopped peanuts. Though this pie is good it needs more cream cheese and peanut butter--both for flavor and to fill up the pie crust a little more. If I make this again I'd increase both.",
