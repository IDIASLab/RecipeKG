I only used 2\u00bd cups of powdered sugar and found it to be more than enough; I can't imagine the coma I'd be in if I had used 4! I used this icing on the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III (pictured) and I had some left over. The key is clearly to beat at medium to high speed for several minutes to ensure maximum peak. I do recommend this recipe provided you make some minor tweaks... I definitely suggest tasting as you go to ensure that you don't accidentally use too much sugar and have no way to remove the excess. Remember, the best recipes on earth still go through trial and error. =)",

As another reviewer pointed out though, it's absolutely unnecessary to beat the sugar in one cup at a time.  Save yourself all that trouble and just pour all 4 cups in at once.  I also used about twice as much milk, but that was just my preference.  I suggest adding milk one tablespoon at a time until you have the consistency you desire.",

To thin it in order to use for spreading, you need to add up to 2 Tbsp of corn syrup or milk.  And that's not mentioned here.  That's also why it uses shortening -- to help piped decorations hold their shape.  The 50/50 ratio of butter to shortening is the compromise of flavour vs. practicality for decorating.    But if you're only using it for spreading, there's no issue with using all butter.  It will be a softer consistency, that's all.",

I made the cake by the directions and just added the dry pudding mix with a 1/2 c. water. The cake is fabulous. I had my neice (mother of grad)come over and try yet another cake and she went nuts. She loved it. She stated \"this is the cake this is the one you can stop looking for recipes. The icing is fabulous. It goes great with the cake. It all just melts in your mouth. Oh I'm in heaven. This is the best cake I've ever had.\" And the grad himself even tried it and loved it. I sent half the cake home with them and they were fighting over who was carrying the cake as they were going out the door. LOL. Well you have made all of us very happy. I get to quit baking bad cakes with so-so to nasty icing and my nephews son knows he is getting a fabulous cake for his grad party. Thanks so much. This was a life saver.",
