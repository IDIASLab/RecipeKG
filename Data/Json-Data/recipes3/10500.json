He wants to try more stuff with peppers now. We came up with a lot of other ideas for toppings too. I can't wait to try the others. Yummy! Having been sick a lot this year my hubby who is an inexperienced cook made this the second time. I forgot to tell him to marinate the chicken ahead of time. Instead of marinating he browned the chicken & then removed it from the pan. He lightly sauteed the mushrooms onions and peppers and added in the marinade ingredients. Then he returned the chicken to the pan and let it all simmer for about 10 minutes. I think I liked it this way even better. Either way this recipe is a keeper.",
