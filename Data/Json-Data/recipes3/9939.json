I was surprised to see that garlic powder, onion powder and pepper was used for this recipe since it's supposed to be a sweet flavor, but I did it anyway. Hoping for the best. I made the recipe to the T and even though I added the maple syrup to it, it was basically a regular sausage patty with a very slight hint of maple. I added more syrup to it after it was cooked and it still didn't taste like a breakfast sausage. I'm sorry, I won't be making this again.",

To everyone who has made comments about fennel not belonging in breakfast sausage (or anise or garlic or whatever) and/or not being important- you don t get to enjoy a whole symphony of flavors in sausage if you only have a string section with one violin. People don t create recipes to address just your preference and neither yours nor the author s is wrong but you don t ding a recipe because of your misguided ideas about food and cooking. Try it even if you think you won t like it. You might surprise yourself. I didn t have star anise on hand so I used fine ground allspice as a little substitute and reduced it I added paprika for color and some marjoram because I like it. Worked well.",
