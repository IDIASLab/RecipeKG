Changes I made: vegetable broth instead of beef broth to make the recipe vegetarian increased lentils used a whole can of chickpeas used a can of diced tomatoes instead of a fresh tomato. I was surprised by the large qty -- would be a generous side dish for maybe 10 people. Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!",

My suggestion would be to increase the lentils 1/2 cup and the chickpeas 1/2 cup and you should be on point. The bulgur just seems to be rather top-heavy. In any case healthy & filling!!!
