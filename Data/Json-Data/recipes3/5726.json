Next I hollowed the pieces out to end with mainly the crust and made sure to leave edges in the short ends. I lightly dabbed some English mustard into the bases. I doubled the eggs and the cheese but kept the rest of the dry ingredients the same. I added 1/4 teaspoon of dried chili flakes. I whisked the egg whites and folded 75% of the cheese into this. Next I whisked the egg yellows and painted the bread well with it to supply some seal to the base. I scooped the egg white mixture into the hollowed bread and filled every one level. Next I garnished some shredded cheese on top of this. I did not pre-toast the bread based on another comment I read earlier and it is the better plan. I pre-heated the oven normally to 175 degrees C and then switched it over to grill. Placed the bread in the middle on a baking tray and grilled until the bread edges went dark brown and the cheese puffed high. Garnished with some basil leaves and enjoy. I am sure some chopped bacon and shredded tomato on the base will make a good variant.",
