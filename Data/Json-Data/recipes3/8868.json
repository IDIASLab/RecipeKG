                "reviewBody": "This is my favorite kind of taco. In my area we use corn tortillas instead of flour and instead of topping with lettuce guac and pico we use cilantro raw chopped onion and green or red sauce. We also use the mini tortillas so we cut the beef into tiny cubes once it has rested. With that being said my review is based on the actual recipe and not the suggested toppings. This works great and gets the meat nice and tender however I feel it needs more actual season. For the 2nd batch I left out the salt and added a couple packets of Sazon seasoning and they were delicious. Overall good recipe and one I would make again. Remember to not let your meat marinate too long. The lime \"cooks\" the meat and turns it mushy if you leave it in there too long.",

Too many recipes opt for the vinegar as the main but this recipe well exceeded expectations.   No changes made; grilled to a fine medium rare. Kids even raved about the flavor.  Will save for a re-do in future.",

I did have a can of diced, so went ahead and used that, marinating for 6 hours. I thought the flavor was really good. After grilling (and resting), I diced into small pieces then thru them in a skillet for a few minutes. I made street tacos topped with fresh cilantro, pico de gallo, shredded cheese, and sour cream. Yummy!! Will make again, using fresh jalape\u00f1os next time.",
