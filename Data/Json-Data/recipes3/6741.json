                "reviewBody": "1 made german style potatoes salad quite often i read the recipe and all the comments. About the recipe i could say that it is much more efficient to peel and slice the potatoes before boiling then that after. if you do it before you can slice them as thin as you want. if you do it after you will have to make large slices because they will break if you try to make thin ones however be careful not to over cook them so that they wont take too much water inside. If you missed that you can dry them a bit inside an oven. i dont think that ising a cucumber will bring up the acidity that this recipe needs. Better use pickles (the sweet and sour recipe). the chopped green onions vinagrette inside would give a great taste. This is also what i would use to spice a rollmops and potatoes salad but it is not what usually flavours the \"kartoffeln salat\" you indeed need something that is between a mayonnaise and a salad cream. the mayonnaise is too hard and the salad cream is too liquid. This definately drives you to make your own dressing on a mayonnaise style (a yellow of egg a tiny drip of mustard a tiny drop of salt and pepper a tiny drop of vinegat or lemon juice a tiny drop of sugar; you mix all this and then you add progressively the neutral oil until you get the consistance and taste that you want.- beware about the tiny drops: its more easy to add a drop that to remove it - beware also that this home made dressing sauce must be kept cole and eaten very quick)",
