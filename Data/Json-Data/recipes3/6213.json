                "reviewBody": "A few tips for those of you struggling with the recipe:\n\n1. While the directions were written for Tuna, it does work well with other fish but the cook time must be adjusted accordingly for the type of fish you are using and the thickness. For salmon I would recommend ditching the garlic -lime marinade, it really is specific to tuna or a similar fish. \n\n2. For those struggling with the heat there are three things:\n- The recipe is designed to be eaten bite for bite with the mango salsa recipe included, if you serve it without it you'll likely need to adjust the heat level by dropping the cayenne.\n- For those who just aren't into the heat, you can simply reduce the amount of cayenne, by half is about appropriate. \n- A nice alternative I've found to the mango salsa is sour cream (about 2tbsp per serving) mixed with a bit of sugar (about 1tsp per 2tbsp of sour cream). This can be served in a ramekin or drizzled over the fish, whatever your heart desires!\n\nHope this allays some of the issues people have had! :) ",

My husband said it was better than some of the ahi tuna we've had in restaurants! I did make just a couple of changes: 1-I added avocado to the mango salsa. Just thought it would taste good. It did! 2-After marinating the tuna I only seasoned it with onion powder garlic powder paprika salt and pepper. 3-I coated the tuna steaks with black and white sesame seeds. 4-I like my tuna very rare so I only cooked each side until it was opaque in color. But when you sliced the fish the bright red color showed thru. This is a fantastic recipe. Thanks so much!",

So I used tilapia which is perfect for blackening because the filets are so thin. (Truth be told however I'm not crazy about tilapia either - it tastes muddy to me like a bottom feeder) Mango salsa is relatively new to me - I have never liked sweet mixed with savory. But I'm liking it lately and this salsa this dish was simply first rate. I used my own blackening seasoning one that is tried and true for me important since blackening/Cajun seasonings can vary so much. I made no changes to the salsa and it was perfect - as good as I've had at any fine seafood restaurant in SW Florida. I am finding however that the jalapenos from my garden have a LOT more heat in them than those I buy at the grocery store so beware if you use homegrown! I served this with \"Cilantro-Lime Rice \" also from this site and they belonged together. This was a beautiful and delicious dish nice for the two of us but certainly company worthy as well. Nicely done!",

I made the marinade and spice mix as directed (1/2 salt). I also halved the oil to make it thick like a blackened fish. I was making this for two steaks;P Hubby is from India and loves spice. For the kids and I I used the sour cream idea. But made it like a raita with tomatoes and onions plus the sugar. It took away the heat.

I will also reduce the amount of onion in the salsa and use 1/3 of an onion and 1/2 of the jalapeno. I didn't have a mango so I used some peach mango salsa and it was fantastic that way. Thanks for a great fish recipe!",
