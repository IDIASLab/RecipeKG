I only ever use half a red onion cause I presonally think that the onion taste is WAY too strong otherwise. I let the whole mixture (minus the avocado - since it would brown) marinate for a few hours. When ready to eat I throw in the avocado (just one) and serve with either Tostitos Lime chips or Black Bean Chips. SO DELICIOUS! I think its a perfect dinner for two. ENJOY!",

BUT, since I was hosting a Fish Taco dinner party, I figured I needed to impress, I went for it. I made about 1-1/2 times the recipe, as I wanted to serve it both with chips as an appetizer and with the Fish Tacos (recipe from this site). I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours to mingle flavors and I think that was a good idea--I wouldn't serve this right off of the chopping board. Anyway, I had to fill up the appetizer bowl about 4 times, and the regular 'ol tomato salsa from the jar barely even got touched. It tasted even better on the tacos. My husand ate about 1/3 cup just as a \"taster\" before anyone even came over. So, huge success, and I will make this again :-) OH! Do wear gloves when handling the jalapenos, my fingers burned for several hours after making this.",

I use 4-3-2-1: 4 ears fresh white corn 3 avocados (not too ripe) 2 medium tomatos 1 white onion. Cilantro and Lime Juice to taste. cut kernels off ears cook in a frying pan w/ tablespoon of olive oil until it starts to carmelize. Meanwhile dice other ingredients into bowl. Pour corn into bowl and mix. Add a qtr cup water to frying pan scrape and reduce leavings until consistency of a thin sauce pour over bowl mix. Add lime juice & minced cilantro. chill. Adding the reduced sauce from the frying pan is important it adds a lot of extra flavor. I am a pepperhead and enjoy extremely spicy food but I keep this mild and simple so everyone can enjoy it.",
