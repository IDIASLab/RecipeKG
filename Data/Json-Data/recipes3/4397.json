Everybody loved them. Add the lime juice to the avocado as you are mashing it and before adding the other stuff and you should have no problem with browning. I topped them off with a little sprinkle of Pico de Gallo. I used 9 eggs and double the recipe for the guacamole and even though I really loaded each egg half with the goop there was plenty left over for some tortilla chip dipping tomorrow. Thanks Lisa Linthicum for a great recipe!",
