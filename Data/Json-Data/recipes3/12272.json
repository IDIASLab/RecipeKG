                "reviewBody": "This is by far one of the better potato salads I have had. Most are just smothered in entirely too much mayo or mustard. This recipe had just enough mayo/sour cream mixture to lightly coat the potatoes so that you can still taste all of the other ingredients. Here's a tip for the bacon. Line a lipped baking sheet with foil and bake your bacon along with the potatoes instead of making a mess of your stove top. 400 is the perfect temp for baking bacon and  it only takes 15-20 minutes and can be cooling and draining while the potatoes finish roasting. On the note of bacon, that is the one change I made. I chose to crumble the bacon over the top right before serving instead of mixing it in with everything else so that it would stay crunchy. That is just a personal preference for me though. This one is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!",

I have seen a similar style one to this in the deli section of the supermarket and wanted to make my own. I was hesitant to try this due to baking the potatoes rather than boiling them; but decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. This is the best potato salad I have every made and is better than similar ones in the store. I halved the recipe because I was unsure how it would turn out. After tasting it I wished I made a whole batch. I will definitely make this again.",

My only complaint is that I made this about 3 hours before dinner and by the time we ate it had soaked up too much of the dressing. Next time I'll either add the dressing right before eating or I'll make a little extra dressing to add in right before serving. I also roasted some cauliflower and used this exact same dressing on it for a delicious low-carb cauliflower salad.",
