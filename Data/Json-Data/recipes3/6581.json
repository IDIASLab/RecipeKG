I also use a bag of shredded coleslaw mix instead of chopping a carrot and cabbage. Works great! I just throw pork, beef or chicken in. Whatever I have or is on sale.

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is super!  Though not wishing to be contrarian, please note that Genevieve's negative review is misinformed.  I'm a bigos aficionado having visited Poland about 50 times and consumed bigos probably in more than 100 locations all over that country.  Upon arrival in Poland, seeking out bigos is usually one of my first endeavors.  I share the foregoing to impart credence to my statements about Polish bigos.  Though no two cooks make it identically, it ALWAYS  is sauerkraut based (indeed usually mostly sauerkraut) and ALWAYS salty.  I have NEVER seen it with venison or any other wild game (but why not?) and it NEVER has a \"thick, rich brown base\" (gravy).  Genevieve obviously is thinking of something else.  The translation \"hunter's  stew\" may be the misnomer.  Bigos, at least as it commonly is prepared in virtually every Polish household and restaurant today, is made with farm raised meats obtained from the butcher - most always including kielbasa and often with pork, bacon and/or ham.  In Europe, recepies prominently featuring mushrooms as an ingredient commonly have the term \"hunter\" (mushroom hunter?)  in their title.  Bigos may or may not have a lot of or any mushrooms.  But, in my experience, it always has a lot of sauerkraut, onions and kielbasa.  The rest left to the imagination and resources of the cook.  In Poland it is said no clever man states a preference concerning the bigos of his wife compared to his mother's if both women are living.",

Never even heard of it until I came to Canada. Also, no Polish cook I know would add basil or flour - it should be thick with veggies and meat but not murky. Also, potatoes are eaten with bigos on the side, mashed, but not as an ingredient. And never, never skip the caraway or tomatoe paste or mushrooms (dry mushrooms should be wild Boletus). Sourcraut is essential. So much for traditional bigos... If you are a vegetarian like I am, skip the meat - the dish is reach and tasty enough without it.",

As an authentic bigos it should at least have 2 chopped green apples a couple pounds of venison shredded ham instead of bacon and pork a couple of cubed potatoes and no sauerkraut. You need to have a thick rich beautiful brown base. Napa cabbage should replace the sauerkraut so that it cooks down and soaks up the flavors instead of making it salty. There is no \"one\" recipe for bigos but it is a hunter's stew and it should be meaty and rich...and shouldn't be salty. This is a recipe for kiel and sauerkraut not bigos.",

I made this with turkey kielbasa light beer instead of red wine (I actually think this turned out really well) and a mixed Italian herb blend. Also I omitted the caraway seed and the celery as we aren't huge fans and I didn't bother with the tomato paste as I didn't want to open a whole can just for a couple of Tbsps. Even with these changes it turned out great - hearty filling with plenty of leftovers for Husband's lunches this week. If I were to make it again I would probably just use chunks of cabbage. The sauerkraut was a bit stringy and didn't contribute much flavor. Some diced potato wouldn't hurt either. Thanks!",

Brown the bacon chopped pork loin (more tender than stew meat) and kielbasa together in a pressure cooker; really generate a thick fond. Add chopped onion and garlic. Deglaze with red wine. Add a whole shredded cabbage and half a jar of Bubbe's sauerkraut with liquid. Add black pepper and two bay leaves. Tomatoes optional. Pressure cook for 7 minutes. Done!!",
