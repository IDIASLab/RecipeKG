Also since I was using canned tomatoes I only sprinkled a little salt instead of the 1 Tablespoon called for. I topped with sliced blackened chicken (recipe from this site) and my husband and son loved it...couldn't believe it was all low fat. The only change I would make in the future is to put in less pasta and to use whole wheat pasta. I used 16 oz pasta.....would probably use 8-10 oz. instead next time. Delicious! Will definitely make again. By the way the cajun seasoning I used was \"Slap Ya Mama\" from Ville Platte Louisiana. I have found it here in the Gulf Coast of Texas and saw it on vacation once in Destin Florida (slapyamama.com). I like it because it's not as salty as some other popular brands of cajun seasoning.",
