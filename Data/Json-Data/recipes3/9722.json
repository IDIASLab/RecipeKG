I should have known not to put so much salt for such a small batch of pancakes but I just followed the recipe and figured they would be a bit salty. They were barely edible. I was planning to eat them with just butter but I had to put jam on them so it was not such a low-carb breakfast for me afterall. Otherwise the recipe was good and I will probably make these again using 1/4 tsp salt or less.",

My pancakes weren't pretty but boy were they good! Tastes similar to French toast! Goes great with cinnamon agave.",
