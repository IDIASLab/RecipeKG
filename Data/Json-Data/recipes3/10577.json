                "reviewBody": "This peanut butter frosting recipe turned out  beautifully.  After reading others comments and experiences, I made a few revisions with excellent results.  1.  Creamed the butter at high speed with whip attachment until the butter was a pale yellow.  2.  Added 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, pinch of salt and whipped until combined.  3. Added 1 Cup smooth peanut butter and 1/3 of a 8 oz. package of cream cheese and whipped again until combined and fluffy.  4.  Gradually added 2 C confectioners sugar and whipped until fluffy.  5.  Added about 3 T heavy whipping cream and whipped again to combine.  Use your judgement about the amount of cream needed...frosting should be light and fluffy.  The frosting was defintely sweet enough with 2 cups of confectioners sugar.  I used this to frost the Black Maguc Cake (the one that calls for adding 1/2 cup boiling water at the end) recipe on this website. Made a few changes to that recipe as well including adding 1 package mini chocolate chips, 8 oz. sour cream instead of buttermilk  and using plain boiling water instead of coffee. Baked in 9\" x 13\" pan 25-30 min at 350.  Perfect amount of frosting.  Rave comments from women and men alike.   Asked if it was an old family recipe.",
