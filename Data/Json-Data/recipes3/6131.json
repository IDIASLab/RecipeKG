For the guac layer I used only 2 avacados which was plenty. I added some chunky salsa to the guac as well. I added a 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning to the sour cream layer for some color and a kick of flavor. I don't like olives so I drained a can of black beans and put about 1/2 on top for garnish. Overall it was a BIG hit and everyone loved the flavors!",
