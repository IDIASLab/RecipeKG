My diet is pretty specific right now so this was easy and delicious low-carb lunch when served with a salad. Greek salad with pink grapefruit added really brought out the flavor blend, and fits well with the Mayo Clinic Diet of adding grapefruit to each meal of meat or fish and salad or veggies. I made a single serving so I am leaving it to the maker to multiply.",

But she can eat a piece of fish with a little lemon and pepper. On the other hand, I like fish recipes that are either spicy or sweet like a mango sauce. Your recipe is easy, but I'd like suggestions how to give it more flavor. Also, I went to The Mayo Clinic for my brain cancer. It's the best for anyone that needs treatment. Blessings, Jack",
