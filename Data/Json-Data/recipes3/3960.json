While the pasta was cooking (I used Rotini)in a fry pan I heated 2 1/2 cloves minced garlic (& I added a bit of chopped garlic for fun) and about 1/2 cup chopped red onion in a little olive oil. I added sugar snap pea pods and sun dried tomatoes. I grilled the asparagus on our Hamilton Beach griller for a few minutes (after mixing with a little olive oil and lemon juice). Then I added to fry pan for a few minutes. I then added all ingredients together in a large bowl and tossed with fresh grated parm chz (a drizzle more oil) and a little salt & pepper. Awesome!",
