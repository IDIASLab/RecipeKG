I can whip it up quickly and have shortcuts, but don't attempt this on hump day if its your first time. 2. Smothered chicken is basically semi-fried chicken and pan gravy. If you can make decent fried chicken and a good pan gravy, put the two together and that's the gist of this dish. 3.To solve the soupy gravy problem, start with the rioux first: add the flour to the pan drippings and cook/stir constantly for about 5 minutes or so, then add the veggies to that for another 5 minutes. It will look a mess, but when you add the liquid and stir it good; your gravy will appear. Add about a cup of liquid at a time and stir between so its not too soupy. Then TASTE IT before you add the chicken. If it's bland, add more salt/pepper/garlic powder/dried thyme/cayenne or whatever till it tastes the way you want. THEN add the chicken. Hope this helps!!!",

I would never use it for a dish like this, which was wonderful, by the way.  I just increased the spices a tad, and we loved it!",

I'm 'reviewing' in response to the June 22, 2007, review which asked why people try to use boneless, skinless chicken breast in a recipe (especially this one) that calls for whole chicken, white and dark, including skin.  Well, to each his/her own...  Maybe some folks use chicken breasts for convenience.  But maybe some use chicken breasts (and don't use the butter and make other modifications) because they've had quadruple heart bypass surgery or otherwise MUST maintain a certain diet.  On the other hand, those who make major modifications to a recipe and then enter a low, critical review?  Not good...",

Any skin-on bone-in chicken pieces will work great, so I used 8 drumsticks. After adding the broth, you should bring it to a boil, stir, add the chicken, bring to a boil again, and then reduce heat to low for simmering. Otherwise, the chicken will sap the heat out and you won't get a good simmer. I followed the recipe as written and after 30 minutes I still needed to bring it to a boil to cook the chicken and thicken the sauce. Another slight improvement is adding salt while the mirepoix cooks (the carrot, celery, and onion). Plus I used Tony's (creole seasoned salt) when flouring the chicken pieces. Thanks for a great comfort food recipe! It's absolutely the best thing on this site that I've been able to execute with ease. Thank you!",
