I read the other reviews and don't let the cheese melting problem some people mention deter you from trying this delicious recipe. TIPS FOR GETTING THE CHEESE TO MELT: 1. Add cheese to pasta as soon as pasta is drained. 2. Use a stainless steel bowl when mixing the cheese with the pasta so the heat from the cooked pasta will be retained aiding in a quicker melting process. 3. Use two forks and go back and forth in opposite directions right after adding the cheese. This helps to distribute the cheese more evenly.",

I did not drain the canned tomato's but allowed the pasta to absorb the excess juice before I served it. I also did not like the look of the cheese and found it made clean-up more difficult (the cheese really coated the forks etc) next time I am going to skip adding the cheese and just serve the pasta with a shaker of parmesan so that everyone can add their own at the table also will have a shaker with red pepper flakes so that the teenagers can spice it up as much as they like. I think the parmesan will be sufficient for us without the 2 1/2 cups of fontina and asiago which really add a lot of calories not to mention expense.",

I only had 1lb of Roma tomatoes, so I used a 14oz can of Italian style chopped tomatoes, which I added to the fresh ones after they marinated. I omitted the mint. Because the cheese this recipe calls for add so much fat and cost, I used about 1/2 to 1cup grated Parmesan. While the water for the pasta was boiling, I sauteed some red bell peppers, fresh baby spinach, white mushrooms, and zucchini to add when I mixed the noodles with the tomatoes. The veggies added a lot of flavor and textures. I found I had a lot of extra sauce/tomatoes with 12oz of pasta, so I cooked 16oz. I toasted some fresh bread, and it was almost like eating bruschetta with my pasta! My boyfriend loved it too. Highly recommended.",

Also, tomatoes in our area aren't very good, so I used plum tomatoes instead: they worked really well and were so sweet! I also added broiled shrimp at the end.
