I make this pie for a restaurant owned by my mother, and we receive many compliments and even requests to purchase whole pies.  You can also use chocolate pudding; the pie tastes like peanut butter cup candy. For a really spectacular presentation, garnish with whipped cream, peanuts, and chopped peanut butter cups.",

I took some of the extra heavy cream and added a little bit of confectioner sugar to it whipped it together and added it to the pie filling so it would be lighter. I took the advice of other reviewers and made the nutter butter crust which turned out really well.
