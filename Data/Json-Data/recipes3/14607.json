I've tried many carne asada recipes through the years, and this one outshines them all. The flavors are the most flavorful and authentic and the meat is pull-apart tender. I suggest marinating overnight for the best results. Muy delicioso!",

I will say they were a lot more tender than the other recipes I made and they all marinated for the exact same amount of time. I made this for a friends Mexican celebration. They liked them but also preferred one of the other recipes I made that used sazon and beer in the marinade. Overall I was pleased with this and will make it again.",

Used a ceramic grill and cooked to medium, the cut into slices and served  with fresh pico and small, warm, fluffy flour tortillas. Absolutely necessary to marinate overnight. I got a little lazy and used garlic powder, skipped the oregano, and used coconut aminos instead of soy sauce. Glad I didn\u2019t skip the orange slices because they really make a difference.
