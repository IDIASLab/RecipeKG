But everyone who ate it thought it tasted great - in fact my grandmother who is a harsh critic of how people cook even asked me for the recipe but she also said \"too much pasta\" and \"use bowties next time.\"",

I too thought a full pound was too much pasta so I cut it back but I liked the idea of using a vermicelli or spaghettini instead of the usual smaller bite-size pastas. I too instinctively went with the dill weed instead of the thyme (hey it's SHRIMP!) and also I added extra parmesan cheese to give it a bit more of a saltiness. Great dish for a buffet!",
