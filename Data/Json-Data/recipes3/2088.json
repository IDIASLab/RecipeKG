However, some modifications were made as the original turned out to be a bit bland for my taste.

It turned out to be a mouth-watering flavorful diverse dish--highly recommended.",

There was plenty of sauce.  The recipe didn't have much taste though.  Since I originally made the recipe because I was looking for something healthy I don't want to add anything like butter or cream to give flavor.  I think I may try this again replacing the stock with wine.  I did use fresh roma tomatoes too and the lack of flavor may have been because it is still early in the season for tomatoes.  Because I am struggling to find heathy recipes I will try this one again.  It deserves the chance since it is a good base.",
