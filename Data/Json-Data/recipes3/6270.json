The only adjustment I will make next time is to use light coconut milk and a 1/2 cup of cashew pieces to see if it lightens it up the recipe calorie-wise. I served this alongside Country Captain Chicken and Indian Cauliflower (the later is also on this site). Finally garnishing this with fresh cilantro definitely gives it an added umph YUMMY!",
