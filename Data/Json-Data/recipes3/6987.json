But even knowing that the terrible avocado was in it, he still admitted he really liked it.  And then he remarked (ha!), \u201cI like to try new things.\u201d Of course he liked it, it was delicious! The avocado gives it richness and a beautiful hint of green color, but it does not contribute much flavor.  I followed the recipe but used fresh parsley and dill. This is simply a lovely, fresh dressing with a simple elegance.",

I made it Saturday, and it tasted even better Sunday night. The flavors had more time to meld, I guess. I don't know how long the dip will stay good, but it's definitely something you can make the night before. It was more of a spread/dip consistency, as is. But I'm sure thinning it with buttermilk would make a fantastic dressing. It tasted so fresh, I might keep making this instead of buying bottles! I'm going to try the light version next time. ",
