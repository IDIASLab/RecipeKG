(When my mom passes down a recipe she tells us the ingredients but estimates the amounts) Well This recipe has the same ingredients (plus a few added spices) but it actually came out better since it was not as dry! I did a few minor tweaks based on other reviews and a desire to make it closer to my Grandma's. I added a little more sage and more broth since some reviews thought it was a little dry. I used little less thyme & parsley as these never part of G'ma's original ingredients but I thought they would make tasty additions nonetheless. It was a huge hit! Everyone that's used to my stuffing was pleased with the flavor (I think it was actually better) but love the moister version! I'm used to my dressing on the dry side but dislike \"soppy\" versions so this ended up being a perfect balance for us. i will be making it this from now on! Thanks!! 2019 (this year I will be experimenting with a small batch made with vegetable broth and no egg for vegetarian) and one a small batch without egg just because I have heard a lot of people never use egg in their dressing-just curious how it will differ)",
