I threw the onion and garlic in olive oil with chicken breast strips and cooked until the chicken was cooked.  Then I added only two cups of chicken broth with diced tomatoes, drained, and added Italian spice blend and garlic spice blend.  I cooked this down a bit before adding about six ounces of spinach.  After the spinach wilted, I added a small amount of corn starch and water to thicken it just a touch.  I served it with an herbed brown rice pilaf and sprinkled feta on top.  It was fantastic and so far from ordinary.  It looked beautiful too.  I might serve this the next time I have company.  Thanks for the recipe. ",

I saute onions and garlic in olive oil with salt and pepper, add the meat (I now use Italian Turkey Sausage instead of chicken) and cook until browned.  Then I add the tomatoes, basil, broth and pasta (I use rotini now - easier to eat with a spoon) and simmer until the pasta is done.  Then I add almost a whole bag of fresh spinach until it wilts and serve.  (don't do the cheese b/c of a dairy allergy).  My 2 and 5 year olds love it and my husband and I do to.  Tastes great and you can't beat a one-pot meal!",

My only problem is it's a bit of a trick to eat; you need a fork for the pasta and a spoon for the sauce. My 2-year-old (who loved it, by the way) ate all her noodles and then dipped her breadsticks in the sauce to soak it up. :) In the future, I think I will cook the pasta right in the sauce to save a step and a clean pan. I may also add a can of tomato paste to make it slightly thicker.",

I also added the pasta (1/2 box whole wheat linguine) right to the pot a few minutes after i added the tomatoes and broth and simmered on low for probably 20-25 min. the pasta was done perfectly al dente. I used about 3/4 a bag of pre washed baby spinach and shredded about 3/4 of a chicken i had baked yesterday. I topped with parmesan and grated asiago.",
