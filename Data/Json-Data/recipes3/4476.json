First of all I pounded the chicken flat placed a slice of cheese inside the chicken breast then rolled it up and wrapped it with proscuitto - couldn't find parma ham. Next I thought the reduced balsamic vinegar sounded like a very strong flavor so we just drizzled UNreduced balsamic vinegar over the chicken. It was delicious! I also cooked the potatoes in the microwave rather than boiling them. I didn't really change the ingredients just the process to make it simpler.",

To the balsamic vinegar I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar some minced garlic some dijon mustard and a splash of hot sauce just to give it some complexity. When I stuffed the chicken with the cheese I added a schmear of minced garlic and one basil leaf for extra flavor. Before putting the chicken and tomatoes (which were wonderful BTW) in the oven I drizzled a little of the finished balsamic sauce and sprinkled a touch of mozzarella over the top. The recipe didn't say whether to cook the chicken covered or uncovered so I covered it for the first 15 minutes then removed the cover. The potatoes were terrific too. I had picked up some really tiny potatoes (about the size of large marbles) and they worked perfectly for this dish. Bottled pesto sauce was pretty expensive at the store so I made my own. The combination of the sharp snap of the potato skins when I bit into them mixed with the great garlicky pesto was just lovely. This dish made an enticing presentation and is certainly company worthy. DH and I both loved this dish. I can't say enough good things about it. Thanks Paula",

I cut pockets first then marinated the chicken in balsamic dressing for about 4 hours. After that I stuffed with mozzerella and wrapped the chicken in Parma de Proscuitto. I also put fresh garlic on top after sprinkling with olive oil. The tomatoes were delicious and really made the flavor of the chicken wonderful. Next time I may find other things to stuff the chicken with such as fresh basil or oregano. Also I think this would be better with the potatoes chopped into pieces THEN mixed with pesto.

Dressed up the balsamic vinegar reduction with 1 tbsp. each brown sugar minced garlic and dijon mustard. Lined flattened chicken breast with fresh basil leaves and marinated roasted red peppers. Also used mozzerella cheese sticks instead of shredded cheese that way it didn't ooze out the sides of the rolled chicken. Used prosciutto too.Sprinkled minced garlic on top of chicken and cherry tomatoes along with the EVOO and s/p. Covered dish for first 15 mins. Buttered potatoes first and then pesto. With the conversions we really enjoyed this dish. Your inspiration though. Thank you!",
