This gravy most certainly taste better when you are using grease from bacon or sausage you have just fried. Also, I watch the browning process carefully, and don't usually brown it for very long before slowly adding the milk. I bring it to a boil to thicken it, but not too much because it tends to thicken on it's on once removed from the heat. if making for breakfast, toss in crumbled sausage or bacon! Also, my family and I really seem to like it with a pinch of garlic powder.",

Kids and hubby ate it up! I can't imagine it with plain oil.  I didn't brown the butter as I wanted a white gravy.  It is important to cook the fat/flour (roux) mixture for a couple minutes before adding the milk.  I noted other reviewers complained of it tasting floury and that would be from not cooking the roux long enough.\nThis would also be good to add crumbled bacon and drippings or sausage and serving wih biscuits.

If you're going to indulge in something this heavy and fattening, you may as well do it all the way! I think it is better not to brown the roux, just let it bubble for a few minutes to get the rawness out of the flour and then add the milk... it's supposed to be white. I love this gravy over biscuits because I'm just not a sausage gravy person. I crave it on Sunday mornings, but I'd eat so much that it's become a Christmas morning treat and that's about the only time I let myself have it. So good!",

Flour tastes just like flour. Does bread taste like flour? No. Because the flour has been cooked.  The author noted to cook the rue for 10 minutes.  If you taste flour, you didn't cook it for 10 minutes.  I don't use as much flour, so I don't cook it for 10 minutes.  Adding the milk it is just a look thing.  The rue just looks like it is ready for milk.  One thing you can do is cut down of the flour, cook the rue, and then cook the gravy on simmer longer.  The water in the milk will evaporate, helping the gravy thicken.\nWhile you stir (and not burn the gravy), you are supposed to sing Bringing in the Sheaves twice, and then the gravy should be perfect....

I did add about a tsp of garlic powder (though I was seasoning to taste and not measuring so that could be more or less) to give it a bit more flavor. I also used light butter instead of vegetable oil. If you are finding it is too runny as a recent reviewer did you need to let it simmer longer. After I got the milk in I let it simmer at least 5 minutes and maybe more and it was nice and thick. I plan on adding some peas and dried beef to this later this week and serving it over toast.
