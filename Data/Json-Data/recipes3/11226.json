For us there was too much of a mild/mellow cream cheese flavor. I think it would have benefitted from the addition of a small can of green chiles or maybe more jalape\u00f1os. It was just a little bland but that may be a personal taste preference. We did enjoy it!",

I read the other review (there s only 1 at this time) that said it was bland and too cream-cheesy and that it needs more zing. I decided to add one more ingredient. I cooked up some real bacon until crispy drained and crumbled it and then mixed about 1/4 cup into the corn/onion/cheese mixture before baking it. My husband and son raved about it! I think the bacon give it the zing!",
