                "reviewBody": "I had to do some adjusting due to the fact that my can of salmon was only 6 oz.The instructions do not indicate whether or not to drain the salmon so I assumed yes and did drain but saved the juice in case I needed it (I didn't). Since I only had a 6 oz. can of salmon I cut the eggs down to two. After adding the eggs to the drained salmon it was like soup and I probably could have gotten away with only one egg. I added the full 1/4 cup of almond meal but felt it needed more because it was still pretty wet/soupy or it would have spread like crazy in the pan. I ended up adding two more tablespoons of almond flour but it could have used more. This needs more seasoning of some sort (bland as is) so I added a teaspoon of dried dill. Finely diced onion would be a nice addition too. Now having less egg and salmon but more almond flour still would have only yielded two patties at 1/2 cup each. I think the 1/2 cup measurement for the patties may have been a misprint because they would have been gigantic patties. I used a 1/4 cup and ended up with four perfect size patties. I also whipped together a dill sauce to serve with the patties which was a nice addition. As is these aren't anything to write home about but were edible and protein packed.",
