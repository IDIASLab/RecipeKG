This is a great recipe to take as pot-luck dish.  When I made this a second time I split the batter up and put bacon in half, and lighly sauted mushrooms in the other - but I baked it in the same dish (1/2 and 1/2).  This is a no fail recipe.  I tried to cut the oil back to 1/4 cup, but it turned out to be too dry - the 1/3 cup is best.\r\n\r\nI would also add a 1/2 tsp. of dried basil or oregano, for variation.\r\n\r\nThis is a winner.",

I have no idea how this dish would be cut into \"bite sized appetizers\" or made to look like the pretty photo included. Perhaps if you took all of the changes that other reviewers suggest it would be memorable but then it would be an entirely different recipe. It is a good base concept and a new way to use zucchini so I liked that. I may try it again with lots of changes. Sorry!",

I added a bit more garlic. I also used green onion instead of regular onion then threw in about two TBSP more of the baking mix so it wouldn't be too mushy. The end result was very pleasing and the dinner party guests all raved about the appetizer. Personally the jury is still out but I am going to freeze the leftovers and serve it at my next party in a few weeks.Can't argue with the masses.",

This could be served warm or cold too. I shredded the zucchini and thinly thinly sliced a small onion and sauteed it until it was caramelized. I also added some much needed seasoning -- things like pepper (why isn't it in the recipe?) and a good pinch of herbs de Provence. I think just about any herbs you like with zucchini or eggs would work. I also think how you mix the ingredients could make the difference in appearances. I mixed all the veggies and seasonings first. I then stirred in the baking mix making sure to evenly coat all ingredients. Then the cheese was mixed in. In a separate bowl I whisked the eggs and oil together and then finally stirred it all in. I took a bit of extra grated cheese and put it on top before placing it all in the oven. I think you could take some extra liberties with the recipe such as mixing in some red pepper or putting thin tomatoes slices on top before baking the whole thing. I think it came out well and all it needed was the right mixing and seasoning.",
