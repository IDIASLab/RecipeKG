I did make this in the 15x10 inch pan called for and believe the chocolate layer is just fine. I didn't think these were too sweet either. I did use a dark chocolate brownie mix. (By the way the recipe calls for a 21 oz brownie mix, which I could not find; most are about 18-19 oz. One of those worked just fine.) I topped my bars with white chocolate peppermint M&Ms as I don't like peppermint candy getting packed in my teeth. That worked very well.",
