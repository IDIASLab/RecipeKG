Personally I think the cilantro really adds some zip to the whole thing - don't leave it out if you have the choice! Still even without the cilantro this is a GREAT recipe. Lots of zing and heat. Edit: If you're having trouble forming a patty with this recipe - An easy trick is to use two forks so that you don't over-handle the meat. Overlap pieces together start small and work your way up keeping the patty even throughout. Don't smash anything down! You might want to add a cup of oatmeal or breadcrumbs if you're really having a hard time of it.",

A word of caution if you experiment though.... my husband and I did find is that if you add too many 'wet' ingredients the burgers won't stick together and become difficult to grill. Perhaps the addition of breadcrumbs or instant rice might combat this. Otherwise this burger gets our stamp of approval! It is PACKED with flavor!",
