First I think I had the best Gala apple ever (seriously crisp and sweet) but what that apple brings to this recipe is really unique the perfect complement to the shrimp and curry I might add. Wouldn't change a thing we loved it. LHOON thanks for sharing an outstanding recipe one that will be made again (and again) in this house.",
