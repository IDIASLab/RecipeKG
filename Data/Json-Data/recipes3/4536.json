A few comments: Taste: I could tell from the recipe that if I made it as printed it might be a bit bland. So I added garlic to the beef/onion mixture and I also added chili powder cumin and garlic powder. Prep time: It took me a LOT longer than 15 minutes to prepare. I don't cook every day but I've been cooking since I was a kid and I am pretty comfortable with a potato peeler and chopping knife. Unless you are quite a chef count on maybe twice as long for prep. Covering: I wish I had left it covered for more than the first hour... the top did get rather dried out. But maybe my oven is too hot. Tomato soup: This added a really good taste! But it didn't go very far. Next time I might use twice as much. This is a really wholesome recipe and it gives you a lot of opportunity to modify it the way you like. In addition to the spices I melted cheese on top at the end of the cooking and I served it topped with some sour cream. Yum!",

I do not cook the ground beef and onion before adding to the recipe, and the potatoes are peeled and sliced approx 3/16\" thick, not diced.  It goes:  Mix finely chopped onion into ground beef.  Put a layer of half of the sliced potatoes, then half of the ground beef/onion mixture pulled into marble sized bits and scattered over the potatoes, then half of the kidney beans with juice, then salt and pepper, repeat layers.  Top with condensed tomato soup then bacon slices. Then bake as directed.  Hope this helps...",

It has potential but needs changes; if I ever make this again I would mix the tomato soup throughout the meat mixture since only the top had flavor and the layers below were dry. I would also coook this on a much higher setting like 425 since the potatoes were still hard after an hour of baking on 350. The only redeeming quality was the flavor on the top where the soup was poured on.",
