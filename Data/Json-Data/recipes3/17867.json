I have several variations for this recipe.  Add more red pepper for extra spice.  Substitute the chicken for clams or shrimp.  Substitute the spinach leaves for diced tomatoes.  I've also added spices such as basil, rosemary and oregano bringing a distinct Italian flavor to the dish.",

I had planned to drain off any extra broth, but it ended up soaking all in and making the orzo really nice and creamy. I sauteed the garlic and red pepper in olive oil then added the pieces of chicken. When the chicken was finished I added the orzo to it and stirred letting it sit on low heat for about 10 minutes. The result was YUMMY! My husband really liked it and has asked for it again. Thanks for sharing!",

I add at least 1 clove more of garlic, plenty of salt and spice, according to my taste that day.  You can slant this recipe either Greek or Italian, to your tastes.  If going Greek, add 1 tsp. oregano, chopped Greek olives and crumbled feta,(before serving), if desired.  To swing it Italian, add basil instead of oregano and serve with shredded parmesan.  I've made this several times, sometimes subbing diced Italian-style tomatoes when I don't have the spinach.  Either way, spinach or tomatoes, you can't go wrong with this easy delicious recipe!  ",

I diced the garlic in order for the flavor to come out more (along with adding a few extra gloves in order to prevent any blandness). I went with tomatoes instead of spinach and found it was quite the hit. I served this with peas and corn which provided enough extra \"color.\" It was a HUGE hit with my family; however my one caution would be to NOT overcook the orzo. I did that a bit and although it was still delicious that would have made a difference.",
