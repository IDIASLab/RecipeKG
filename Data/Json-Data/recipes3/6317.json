Try wrapping slices of ham around the leeks before baking then serve with a side of mashed potatoes rice or crusty bread. This alternative version is particularly attractive if you don't halve the leeks (but you would need to pre-cook them for about 8 minutes then either use the leek broth in place of some of the milk or add it to a soup later). You can also add another layer of flavor to this dish by stirring about 1/4 tsp. dry or prepared mustard into the sauce before baking.",

Overall, a nice way to use up leftover leeks (I halved the sauce recipe to use on one large leek leftover from a stew.) This sauce would also work nicely for vidalia onions.",

I layered thinly sliced eggplant leek and roma tomato poured on some of the sauce made another layer more sauce a final layer of just eggplant and the tiny bit of sauce that was left.

The 1st time, I made it as instructed but no one would touch it, I guess the look was more off putting then the flavor. So I tried again a 2nd night and chopped up the leeks into smaller pieces instead of leaving the leeks in the long sliced form. I didn't try it the 1st time to know that I wasn't going to like it. But did the 2nd time and it really wasn't pleasing to anyone's taste but one of my kids. Sorry.",
