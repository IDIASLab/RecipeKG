Since the submitter didn't specify what type of potatoes I used red skinned and left the skin on the type of vinegar also wasn't specified so I used white wine vinegar and cut that down to only 1/2 tsp. I upped the dill to one Tbsp. and left out the veg. oil and dill pickles as I thought those two ingredients in particular would ruin this completely. I won't be making this again.....",

Knowing I don't like an overpowering vinegar tang I cut back on the vinegar to two tablespoons. I mixed in the sour cream and because it was so pretty at that point speckled with its flecks of fresh dill green onion and celery reluctantly added the chopped dill pickle - and I almost immediately knew I would regret it. Unfortunately this was still too vinegary all but obliterating the fresh taste of the dill celery and green onion and the mellow creaminess of the sour cream. This would have been so much better with very little or even NO vinegar especially if you're going to add the dill pickle which I really would have preferred left out altogether. And come to think of it I'm not sure what the need for the oil was. That could have easily been left out as well. I have a feeling there will be lots of leftovers.",
