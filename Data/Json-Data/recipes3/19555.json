I sauteed the onions in a little butter and oil until the onions were soft and clear.  Then I added sliced baby portabella mushrooms with a little salt and cooked on low about 5 minutes.  I think this step brings out the sweetness of the onions and flavor of the mushrooms.  Then I added the chicken broth.  When I don't have time to make the broth I use a good quality soup base that has chicken listed as the first ingredient on the label.  This is as good as any broth you would make, not like bullion cubes. I skipped step two because I like whole mushrooms.  I like it better this way and it also saves time and mess.  To thicken the soup I just used my tupperware mixer and mixed the flour with a little water.  I added this to the soup mixture then added the half and half and the sherry.  I used the fat free half and half and no one had a clue.  Everyone loved it! Next time I'll make a bigger batch.",

But break out of your rut and serve this one to company! Not hard or time consuming to make and simply fabulous restaurant quality fare. The Soup Nazi would be proud of this one.  I had all the ingredients including the sherry (a miracle) and made this exactly as the recipe stated except pureed only half the mushroom broth mixture as other reviewers suggested.  One 8oz. pkg. of mushrooms yields about the 5 cups needed. Unexpectedly, my butter and flour got thick like mashed potatoes. But after you stir it all in with the liquids its fine. The thyme is the secret ingredient. It\u2019s a unique flavor way beyond any canned and compliments the mushrooms perfectly. 10 stars!",

This ended up being even better than the restaurant soup, but exactly what I had been hoping for!!  \n\nI used fat free half and half, vegetable broth, 20 ounces of pre-sliced mushrooms (half baby portabello, half traditional grocery mushrooms), only 1 TB of butter and 2 of flour (although next time I'd use less).  I doubled the onion to 1 cup sweet onion, added a bit of extra black pepper, and finally, used about 1/3 cup white wine instead of 1 TB sherry.  I also added 1 TB crushed garlic, which was a nice touch.  I only blended about half of the mushrooms and onions and left the rest solid.  \n\nThis was a fantastic soup, and I am so glad I used this recipe!!  Thanks so much for sharing!!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a pretty good mushroom soup recipe, with a little tweaking of course. I saute half the mushroom/onion/seasoning mixture - no broth yet - then I added a little half and half and put it in the food processor. Never add salt to mushrooms until they've already browned or it won't happen, but other seasonings are fine. I made my roux (that's the half butter/half flour mixture) at the same time. You're supposed to whisk it for a few minutes until it doesn't smell like flour anymore, and the \"mashed potato\" consistency another reviewer mentioned is desired - a roux is a thickening agent used as the base of many soups. Then add liquid SLOWLY - otherwise it won't mix into the roux well, and you'll get lumps. Once it gets to a cream sauce consistency, you can add your puree if you're using one. I keep the other half the mushrooms chunked, and saute those off as well. I hit them with the sherry, let the alcohol cook off, then dump that into the soup. I use equal parts chicken stock and half and half , until the consistency is how I like it. I've never measured, so I can't tell you the exact amount. Add salt and pepper to taste, I use red pepper flakes as well, and you're good to go!",

However, I still thought it seemed more like mushrooms with sauce than soup.  The third time was the charm, I doubled all the ingredients except the mushrooms, onions and sherry, and this time I loved it.

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious, delicate, creamy flavor! I had the very good luck of coming into some fresh organic shitake mushrooms. I chose to spend them on making this soup, and it was the best decision I could have made. I followed the recipe exactly but only used 2 T. of flour and butter to thicken, since I knew the shitakes would produce less moisture than other varieties of mushrooms. The consistency was thick but good. For sherry I bought a medium dry amontillado, which lent the soup a delicious subtle finish. Don't skimp on the sherry. I do wish the onions had melted into the soup better. Maybe I'll saute them first next time, as some reviewers have suggested.",
