This was plenty of zip for our children's tastebuds! To lighten the recipe I used milk instead of half and half and increased the flour by a tablespoon to keep it thick. I also didn't add the butter at the end and left out the cheese (although the cheese would have been good). The soup doesn't look terribly appetizing but the flavor is fantastic! Will definitely be making this again!",
