I made this exactly as written and let it chill in the refrigerator overnight. I like all of the ingredients in this and truly expected to like it but the problem was in the tequila. It is so strong that it was like a punch in the face. It is all you can taste and the aftertaste is not pleasant either. It is left \"raw\" in this recipe and it really needs cooked down. For the record I used a very high quality tequila straight out of Mexico. Avocados are expensive in my area so I will add things and make this work but as written this is not good. Sorry.",
