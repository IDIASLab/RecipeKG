I don't even like getting Bleu Cheese dressing at restaurants anymore because most are such a disappointment compared to this recipe. If you use the recipe exactly as listed you get a very thick almost dip-like consistency which is very good on both salads and as a vegetable dip. If you like your dressing a little thinner just add some milk and mix well. The dressing is alway more thin-like when first made but thickens up as it sits in the refrigerator. This is the most beloved recipe I have found on Allrecipes.com.",

Also if you are in a pinch and don't have time to refrigerate to allow time for the flavors to meld simply add the dressing into the blender and add some Roquefort/blue cheese and blend away then you can also add more crumbles and whisk to desired chunkiness. This adds the cheese flavor immediately that you would otherwise get with time in the fridge.",

I used low-fat mayo and light sour cream and my container of blue cheese (not roquefort just regular blue cheese) was only 4 oz. It was perfect for me but I know others probably prefer it cheesier.
