I add(ed) finely chopped onions, Parmesan cheese, salted butter & garlic salt. I also used bagged (vs. boxed), frozen spinach heated up in the microwave. (It's the \"driest\" way I know to cook spinach.) I served this (my) rendition at Christmas and it was good enough that the kids ate it w/out complaint. :-)\nI'll have to try it with bacon, as some Reviewers suggested.

I was skeptical about the amount of nutmeg - its not a \"little bit\" - it was a lot! I can see where half as much might have been nice, but none of us ate more than a few bites. I will try this again with no more than 1/2 the nutmeg suggested.  Also, I don't see the need for a food processor - it seems like you'd get mush. Just drain the spinach, put it on a cutting board and use a knife to chop it up a bit. And a tip: if you're more likely to have cream cheese in the fridge, you can substitute it nicely for the heavy cream. Just add it in with the spinach and stir to melt it without burning.",
