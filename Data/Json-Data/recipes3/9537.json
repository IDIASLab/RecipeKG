Next time I will try it with some freshly chopped parsley or basil for color and a little extra zip. I also will add some chopped onion when frying the bacon. It's a great recipe as is yet very versatile. Thanks...it tastes a lot like they make at Oregano's a fantastic little Italian restaurant in Richmond Hill Ontario.",
