I also like to make the mixture and let it sit in the fridge overnight so the sauce can soak in. I have found that the potatoes dont fully cook and sometimes stay hard if you cook it right away. And of course it reheats really well in the micro or my skinny husband throws a little butter in a frying pan and cooks it that way which is really good too!",
