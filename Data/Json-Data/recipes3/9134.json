Sophisticated enough to serve at brunch, this quiche also fits right in as finger food at summer picnics. We especially love it when most of the ingredients come from our farm share and we use fresh eggs from our neighbor's chickens. Friends who initially raised their eyebrows at Swiss chard not only request I make it, they ask for the recipe. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

The chard absolutely MUST be sauteed and drained before adding to the egg mixture. Otherwise you end up with an enormous pile of leafy material that will never fit in the crust. The filling still seeped out all over so I'd also recommend baking this over a sheet pan. The cooking times were accurate. I don't think I'll be returning to this recipe.",

I think I'm just going to use 8 oz of swiss cheese next time rather than 10- it's really really cheesy as is.\n\nI always laugh when a recipe using raw eggs says to salt to taste- like I'm going to taste the quiche before I cook it!
