                "reviewBody": "Good basic recipe to get ya going! Here are a few tips: you can use sour cream instead of yogurt. Either way unless you are using Greek Yogurt (which is already drained) you must drain it. Spoon it into coffee filters or papertowels set in a colander and then set all that into a larger bowl overnight in the frig. You also must PEEL SEED and DRAIN the cucumber. After dicing it wrap up in papertowels and squeeze the juice out or you will have a runny raita! Fresh spearmint and cilantro are a great combo for this sauce. Dried spices are not going to work. The cumin is a nice touch even a little cinnamon (I mean a PINCH) and then top with ground sumac...this is pretty authentic and certainly refreshing for all kinds of summer cooking...lamb koftas pakoras anything spicy is better with this raita on it! This is my basic go-to recipe I just add things for fun now and then...my favorite addition is plenty of minced fresh garlic this will knock your socks off! Or chopped tomato a green chile...Most important thing is to let it chill for a few hours so the flavors can mingle. It always tastes better to me the next day. My photo here shows this dish with ground sumac on top.",

I added one tablespoon of lemon juice. I agree with the parsley and cilantro amounts. I added less than a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin it seemed like too much for 6 oz of yogurt it was approximately 1/3. I suggest you use greek yogurt and if not strain plain yogurt with a coffee filter or cheese cloth for an hour.",
