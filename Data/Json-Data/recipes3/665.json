Also instead of choc. peanuts- used choc. covered pecans.  We put in decorative glass containers with computer labels and named it as our daughters' \"Special Christmas Recipe\"- she was so proud-when she gave it to relatives- she would tell people \"I made it my ownself- with my own two hands!

The Wheatnuts make it unique...for those of you that can't find them, they are in the snack section of the grocery store, usually on a top shelf, where the Chexmix and stuff like that is...NOT with all of the canned nuts.  If you've never tried them, they aren't actually nut, they have a nut-like flavor and most of the variety of shapes don't remotely resemble a nut!  Make the extra effort to find them. They are addicting and like nothing you've tried before!  I think the additon of Craisins is a great idea and I will add those, as well.  White yogurt coated raisins or white choc. coated mini pretzels would also be a fun & colorful addition!  Thanks for this new & different version of a salty & sweet snack!  I will be giving this away to teachers, neighbors, pastor, friends, etc. and I'm sure my kids will have a blast putting it together and bagging it up for everyone!",

I used one jar of salted roasted peanuts, two bags of Christmas M & M's, one bag of white chocolate chips, one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and a large bag of Craisins. The tartness of the craisins helped cut the sweetness of the candy and the salty peanuts were a nice contrast to the other ingredients. Mixed together, this stuff tastes sooo delicious! And so quick and easy! I put it in Mason jars for teacher gifts as well.",
