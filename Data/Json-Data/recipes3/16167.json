The only change I made the second time around was to cut the beans back by half a cup (this seemed to make the bean consistency less tough), increased the broth by a quarter cup and used a mixture of chicken breast and thighs.  The flavor of this is amazing and it's just so hearty and perfect for chilly weather days!",

Maybe because of the surplus of beans, the chili was too thick.  I added an additional 1/2 cup of chicken broth, and pressure cooked for an additional 20 minutes.  It came out perfectly!  The chili isn't spicy at all, but has a very nice flavor.  I will definitely make it again, with 1/3 less beans, and I'll bump up the cooking time to an hour.",
