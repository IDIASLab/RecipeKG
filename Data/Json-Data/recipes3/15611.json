I didn't brush the finished burritos with butter though. I used blue corn tortillas instead of flour. Thank you for the recipe.",

Not sure how they figured 4 servings. We used Lawry s Carne Asada seasoning. We will use 1/2 T less and maybe 1/2 T of garlic powder going forward. We cooked the meat separately in batches which worked great. We also cooked the veggies separately for a couple of minutes before adding the meat back in. The recipe can support at least another cup or more of potatoes. We will also increase the eggs next time by at least two and we will cook them with a little milk as we usually prepare them. If you follow this recipe without our proposed changes you will still have a great breakfast.",
