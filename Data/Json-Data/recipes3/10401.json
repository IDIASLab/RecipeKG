I will try again with the concept but I'll do things a little differently. 1) no olive oil for the pasta 2) no saved pasta water 3) do not discard bacon grease but use to saute the brussel sprouts to create a crisp side 4) add in the mushrooms after a few minutes. Increase rosemary to a teaspoon. Add Parmesan as a topping after serving and individuals can mix in. Use a thinner pasta - maybe a spaghetti or similar.  I love the concept of this recipe but I think it just missed in the flavor department.",
