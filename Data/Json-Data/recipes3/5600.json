So, I did steam my broccoli in my Micro steamer for 2 to 3 min.  Then I added the broccoli to the garlic in the skillet to saute, for about 2 min... set aside off fire with lid on it for about 2 min. I then put the broccoli, garlic and cheese in with pasta, put on lid and let that set as I finished the rest of dinner about 10 min.  O and I forgot to save the pasta water, so I put in 3tbs of chicken broth.. I only made 1/2 of this recipe as there is only two of us.  You have to let the flavors meld. I did not change the recipe just the course of how its prepared to more flavor.  If you want more garlic taste too, add a few cloves to your pasta water as it cooks. Thanks... I tried this because broccoli and pasta is my sons favs... ",

I'm eating the leftovers for lunch right now, actually. Also, instead of just Romano, I used Kraft's Parmesan, Romano and Asiago cheese mix---but only b/c my store didn't have just Romano.

I cut up 1 lb chicken seasoned it with italian seasoning & garlic & added that to the pasta/broccoli for a one-dish meal. I also used 2 tsp Mrs Dash tomato basil garlic blend which made it taste great; highly recommended! A very tasty quick meal.",
