It tasted *amazing*, especially when you remeber how bland turkey can be. Not so here! It never firmed enough up in the oven to slice cleanly without falling apart - it was a touch mushy, which means no leftover meatloaf sandwiches.

We also thought that the\ntexture was just fine.\n   Now, my apologies because I intended on staying close to the original recipe but due to circumstances some things were modified...I did use 1 and 1/2 tsp. of the Italian seasoning in the meat (after reading some of the other reviews) and 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I used 1 pound pork sausage with the ground turkey, because that's what I had.  The sauce for the top was modified because I don't buy sauce, but the sauce I made was simple and completely winged so anyone can do it in a pinch.  And lastly I did double the hot sauce drops.  \nThe meatloaf was much larger then I was expecting and at 350 degrees it took around 2 hours to bake. \nIf you're in need of the Simple sauce...I used 1-14oz can diced tomatoes, 1-6oz can tomato paste, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp. basil and 1/4 tsp thyme.",

I only put half the sauce on before cooking and leave the rest as a side to spoon on by anyone who wants more after it's cooked. I layered strips of roasted red and yellow peppers over the sauce before baking. Next time I want to make meatballs this is the recipe I'll be using! For fun I would add some freshly grated parmesan cheese for the meatballs. Thanks Chris!",

I also omitted the italian seasoning and next time would go for maybe 1/2# of turkey sausage and up the plain turkey. I think those are the only necessary changes - the sauce was great the consistency was good it just was too italian seasoned for me and I skipped the extra seasoning even.
