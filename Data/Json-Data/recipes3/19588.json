I doubled the recipe, because I knew it probably would go over well. I did add a little diced celery and a cubed potato tho. We also added black pepper. I think it was salty enough tasting w/o adding more. We also floated round buttery crackers on top to give it that pot pie crust. Thanks for posting this recipe Tracy. It is a keeper here! I intend to pass this on to all my family and friends too. :o)",

I also added cubed potato which made it chunkier.  I upped the recipe by 10 but I didn't follow it exactly: I took the advice from others and didn't add nearly as much milk.  I added it abou 1/2 cup at a time until it was the consistency that I wanted-not too thick, not too runny. :) I added some garlic and served with cornbread.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.",

One might want to use slightly less milk for a thicker soup, and the basic idea of this recipe translates well into other combinations.  (For example, substitute broccoli and spinach for the vegetable medley; cream of mushroom or celery for the cream of chicken soup only, and prepackaged and precooked cubed ham for the chicken).  This is a very good idea for soup, thanks for sending it in!",
