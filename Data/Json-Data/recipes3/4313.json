SunMaid has a product that is a trio of different raisins and it was nice to have the variety. I only had Gala Apples and it still had a good flavor. Love the crunch! This will be a must for the holidays as it's a departure from heavyhanded side dishes. Also great to serve for vegetarians or vegans.",
