As usual I changed it a little. First it was too mayonaissey (I don't think that's a word) so I used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream. I also eliminated the celery seed and green onions as I just wanted a simple sweet coleslaw. This is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing Lynne",

The honey in this recipe gives it that little something extra that makes it better than any other coleslaw I've ever had. I needed to use up half of a bag of coleslaw mix I had left over from another recipe so I used the ingredients I had on hand to make the recipe. I used red wine vinegar and didn't add the celery seed or onion just because I didn't have them.",

For the raab don't use the tough stems. We found it was almost too sweet for our tastes so will use less honey next time. The 1 Tablespoon of celery seed was fine. It didn't overpower the dish. Also used green onions as stated in recipe. I served this atop halibut cheeks that had been baked in a little olive oil with the juice of one Meyer's lemon with salt and pepper. Then I put the fish and slaw in between warmed hamburger buns for fish sandwiches. Delicious! We had enough to just serve the rest of the salad along side.",
