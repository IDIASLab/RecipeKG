Here they use Anaheim and Poblano chili\u2019s but back home it\u2019s only Hatch Green Chili. It is grown in southern NM close to a little town called Hatch which if you don\u2019t know the area it\u2019s near Las Cruces and El Paso. I made a few changes. I cut the pork roast into chuncks, breaded both sides and set aside while I did the onion garlic and green chili. I added a lot more green chili. Have a large quantity of chili if you like spicier. Everything else pretty much the same. It turned out AMAZING! I\u2019m making my second batch today for my stepson who\u2019s in the Navy and been away from NM for a very long time. It\u2019s actually my welcome home stew I\u2019ll call it. ??",
