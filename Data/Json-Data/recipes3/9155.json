You have to try this recipe to fall in love with this lentil dish. I have now made it at least 4 times exactly to directions changing out the chicken stock for vege stock only...(I am a vegetarian.)It is not a hard recipe and comes out a winner every time! Even people who are not big lentil fans love it! Black lentils are nothing like other lentils and they hold their texture and absorb the flavor. I have served it with tofu steaks and a salad or with brown rice and a vegetable. Great as left overs!",

They looked interesting so I thought I'd try them. I got home and found this recipe for them. Who knew lentils could be tasty? I usually don't like lentils but this recipe is good. I didn't use the butter (trying to make it healthier) and did not have fresh thyme. I used a palm-full of dried thyme instead. I also added a bit more bouillon for flavor because I did not have the Champagne vinegar. Will be adding this recipe to my recipe box. Thanks Chef John!",

I served it as a main with a side of roast pumpkin and this actually turned a fantastic dish into a superb one. I followed the recipe exactly (except I omitted the butter for a vegan version) and I replaced the parsley at the end with oregano and basil as I had those fresh on hand. The thyme worked superbly during the cooking phase and the vinegar is a most. I chose apple cider vinegar this time. Next time I am trying this is a base for a \"Vegan Shepard's Pie\" as I think this would work superbly for that. So pleased I found this wonderful dish.",
