The aroma had me so intrigued I sampled it; simple yet divine. I ladled some over zucchini noodles instead of spaghetti even though it hadn't reduced all the way. Definitely perfect for pasta and eating as is or once reduced using for lasagne crespelle or ravioli. Wonderful on its own as a sauce for the famous Italian \"scarpetta\" which means using your bread to scoop it into your mouth no pasta required. After 4 hours on low it did reduce enough to make it a thick sauce. Thank you LaDonna Reed for this wonderful recipe.",
