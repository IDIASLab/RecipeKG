Like many of the other reviewers, I was nervous to be experimenting on such an expensive piece of meat.  The more reviews I read, the more nervous I got.  I read other instructions on cooking prime rib on other sites .  Bottom line, don't second guess anything.  Follow the instructions to the letter.  The only thing I did differently was I marinated mine for three days.  I followed the 5 min per pound rule of thumb.  I do have a gas oven.  (Some suggested issues with this).  My family ALL said this was the VERY BEST prime rib they had EVER had anywhere!  I agree!  I made a yummy horseradish sauce to go with although it really needed nothing else.  It was so incredibly tender you could cut it with a butter knife !  LOVE IT!!!",
