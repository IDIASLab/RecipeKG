I omit the milk, only use 8 oz. Cool Whip & use 3/4 cup sugar & 1 Tbsp. vanilla, which make only one, rich & creamy pie that holds together better.  This recipe is a great one, but if you know what Nutter Butter cookies are, you'll want to try the crust w/ this recipe!!  I have also added a layer of dessert fudge to the bottom of the pie and it went over very well.",

Substiture low sugar peanut butter.  The whipped topping from the store is already low sugar and then top with pieces of sugar free Reeses Peanut Butter cups and drizzled with sugar-free chocolate sauce.\r\n\r\nMy family and friends never knew when I served it up that it was low sugar....until I told them!",

I have made several pies like this in the past and thought it was unusual to be adding milk. I thought it would end up runny. I made the pie for my church dinner after service. I had frozen it overnight as called for and the pie had sat out for maybe 2 hours. I understand that the pie would have thawed out but with experience with pies in the past it should have kept its consistency somewhat. However it ended up being like melted peanut butter ice cream pie. It went everywhere! I KNEW not to add milk but I went against my own judgement. If you are going to keep in refrigerated and take it out RIGHT BEFORE serving it would be okay but do not let it lose it's coldness or you will have pie filling everywhere! With that said it is still a great tasting pie but my previous peanut butter pie recipe did not call for milk and it held together well even after sitting for a little while. So my advice would be if you are going to take this to a reunion or get together where it will have to sit out for an hour or so DO NOT add milk!:)",
