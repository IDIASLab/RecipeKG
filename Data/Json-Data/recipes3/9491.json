I like a cakier muffin, so although I used all the same ingredients except for the oil (I used melted butter), I followed the recommendations to add an egg and a splash of milk to the wet ingredients.  The batter was still thick but the results were excellent.   Inexperienced bakers should be warned to not overmix the batter.  Overmixing will change the texture. It might also be noteworthy that muffins should not be left to cool in the muffin pan.  That also changes the outcome.",
