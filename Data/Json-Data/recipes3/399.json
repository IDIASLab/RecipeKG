Sift the powdered sugar and cocoa powder together before adding - again, to ensure no lumps or bumps.  Finally, I'd suggest not adding ANY milk until the end, and then do so little by little!  Particularly if you're going to pipe this frosting, as I did, you won't want to use the full amount!  I wanted a pure chocolate frosting so I didn't add the cinnamon and this is exactly what I was looking for.  Smooth, richly chocolate, and the cream cheese makes this a not-too-sweet frosting.  I used this to frost \"Lori's White Bread Cake,\" also from this site (a little plug for that lonely but exceptional recipe!) and it was like gilding the lily!",

I tried it about an hour after I made it and hated it - the flavors didn't go well and the sugar stood out. About 5 hours later guests started eating the cake and raving about the frosting. The bowl with the extra frosting was the most popular item in the kitchen. I tried the frosting again and agreed it was actually very good - so make sure that you plan ahead when making this.",

I used both the cinnamon as well as 1/2 teaspoon cayenne and only 3 cups sugar as opposed to 4 and only 3 T milk. I whipped the cream cheese butter and vanilla first per folks' suggestion. My disappointment came with the texture which is really just personal preference and not anything the recipe ever promised to be: thick sticky and a bit too cocoa-powdery even after 12 hours. I haven't made too many homemade icings in my time so wasn't sure what to expect and had hoped for a little more fluffiness. I think next go I would whip some heavy cream first into soft peaks and try folding it in. The recipe produces plenty -- I had about 3/4-1 cup left after icing a 9 13.",
