I basically made it near exact as the recipe. I am not a huge fan of hard cheeses melted. They do not melt well in my opinion. With the amount it made all of the cheese on top hard which I expected. I ended up using parmesan which is similar and I thought for a hard cheese 1/2 cup was way too much. I thought less than half that amount would have been plenty. The only other change I made was using only 1/4 tsp. of the red pepper flakes. I used whipped cream cheese and low fat mozzarella but that did not seem to be a problem. I also sprinkled a little cornmeal on the pan as I usually do with pizza. I can see something similar working as a small appetizer but not as a pizza taste or texture wise.",
