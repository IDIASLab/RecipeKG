I then drizzled the dough with about 1 1/2 tbs cold beer and it did the trick. i set aside some dough without the cajun seasoning in it and I made a second batch which I flavored by sprinkling oregano and chilly flakes onto the dough prior to cutting it this time in round shapes instead of straws. Personally I like the recipe I think some of us are having problems with the dough due to the temperature of our butter.",

I think LilAngel's right; something must've been left out of this one: liquid. I used Draculeen's idea and added some beer to achieve the right consistency. I took a little taste of the dough and noticed the Dijon and Cajun spice flavors were lost so I added QUITE a large amount more Dijon and it still was not prominent. When they came out of the oven I thought they looked rather dry so I brushed them with melted butter and sprinkled some more cheddar on top to melt. My husband said they tasted a bit like Cheez-Its and ate his with ranch but he was not at all impressed with these and nor was I.",
