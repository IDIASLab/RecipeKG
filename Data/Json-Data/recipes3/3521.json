I can't wait to see how they do with freezing and reheating- it'll give me a way to have a breakfast on the go.\r\n\r\nI can easily see replacing the bacon with diced ham or sausage crumbles.  Everything else, I'd keep the same.  My husband wants me to try making it without the green chiles, but they are so good if you are using salsa on top!\r\n\r\nOne hint- USE paper muffin cups... even with a well greased muffin pan, the egginess doesn't allow them to come out easily.

This is a quick breakfast dish already. First, 1/4 cup of butter is all that is needed. Secondly, 2 cups of shredded cheddar/monterey jack cheese is a better amount. I can't imagine this with more cheese than that. I used diced ham and sprinkled some freeze dried chives on the tops before baking for extra flavor & color. A note on pans - for one tray, I used my Pampered Chef stoneware muffin pan (still sprayed with Pam) and they puffed up beautifully & came out perfect. My other pan, an old non-stick sprayed with Pam - didn't come out as puffy, or as easily. I will buy a 2nd stoneware pan now! Thanks for the yummy breakfast!",

I've never had a problem with them sticking which is odd given that so many people have complained of sticking. I do use butter-flavored cooking spray to lightly grease my non-stick muffin pans though. And I use a spoon to sort of edge around each puff to loosen it from the pan edges. If you want a little green but don't care for the canned chiles you can use chopped fresh baby spinach or parsley. I also substitute diced ham for the bacon most times. I use 8 oz of shredded Mexican blend cheese in the mix and then about another 4 oz on top. After accidentally forgetting to add the melted butter once I've now omitted butter from the recipe altogether. It doesn't need it. You could probably add anything you would throw into an omelette to tailor these to your liking. Just make sure you dice or shred pretty small. Anything too big or heavy will sink to the bottom and not mix properly while baking.",

I used muffin liners as some people suggested, but they were really hard to peel off the puffs.  The chile peppers give this a weird taste. If I were ever to make these again, I would substitute onions and peppers or even spinach.  Also the amount of cheese is ridiculous, and I don't know what the point of the melted butter is.  I halved the amount of monterey jack and halved the amount of butter and these were still horribly greasy.  When I took them out of the muffin pan there were little pools of oil left behind.  Ugh. I can't imagine what it would have been like had I used the amounts stated in the recipe.  I was hoping these would make a great breakfast-on-the-go option, but they just weren't for me.
