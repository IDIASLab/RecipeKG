For a little variation, I added chopped dates, and switched the almonds out for hazelnuts or pecans. I also use Pink Lady apples with it because they are still tart, but a bit sweeter - they are perfect for this salad. I enjoy how simple it is and you can always do small variations by changing an ingredient or two by just a little bit.",

I used a honey Greek yogurt which is much creamier and thicker than a standard yogurt and added a drop of vanilla oil and a squirt of honey. I used 3 Jonathan apples and 1 Granny Smith. This was fabulous and even better two days later. I also added some lemon juice so the apples wouldn't turn brown. 07/08/11 I have made this numerous times since I first reviewed in fall 2010. This is a great recipe. I recently made for 4th of July picnic using 4 different kinds of apples (Granny Smith Pink Cripps Pink Lady and Fuji). I doubled the recipe for a large group and added vanilla to the plain Greek yogurt as I suggested in my first review. So many compliments and there was no leftovers to take home. I think the name Autumn Apple Salad is misleading as this recipe transcends the seasons. Another reviewer stated that dried fruit is too expensive. Yes it is but small amounts are called for and really make this dish sing. Especially the dried cherries. Try some honey too as I think that also adds to the flavor immensely.",
