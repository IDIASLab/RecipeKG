The answer to the morning rush was introduced to consumers in 1967. What might that be you ask? Well, my family calls it by a divine name, but you may know it as the countertop microwave. Pre-mixed eggs, ready for scrambling (restaurant style), the grainy style chorizo, and a single ceramic mug are all it takes to whip up this delicious meal in 2 minutes flat. Fully cooked and ready to get you get your stomach churning. I\u2019d recommend a mug with a handle for ease of...well...handling. You can even take it directly to the car for a meal on the go! Trust me when I say that the taste is not compromised, so long as you grease up the mug with a healthy dose of salted Kerrygold pure Irish butter. Imagine the sort of country we could have if the knuckleheads in charge worked with this kind of efficiency!",

If you can find the made in house type, might be even better. I always add half an onion and 1 small garlic clove once the chorizo has cooked down. Once the onion is cooked and translucent, i add in about 10 eggs to one entire package of Chorizo. Serve with refried beans, pickled jalapenos and some warmed flour tortillas!",

Will definitely be making again. Thanks for an easy recipe that tastes authentic!",
