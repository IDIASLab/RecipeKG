Since I didn't have time to marinade I modified it by boiling it instead of baking it (about the same cook time). I started with just enough water to cover the meat and ending it with enough sauce to go with the rice. I did also add a medium size purple onion (sauted it) and two tomatoes for richer flavor and thicker sauce. My daughter loved it!",
