I used italian seasoning instead of the individual ones , ended up using 1 1/2 cans of tomatoes because of the added meat and doubled the cheese.   YUM!!!  I can't wait for a party so I can suprise everyone with this dish!  Original recipe would have been perfect too, just changed it for my family's tastes. Thanks!!",

Next time I'll increase the onion and all the seasonings add a little cayenne pepper for zing and throw in a can of tomato paste and some sliced mushrooms. A few tips: Start with a big pot - the recipe as-is was waaay too big for my skillet and I had to transfer it to a soup pot halfway through. Also the toasted seeds of the spaghetti squash made a great snack. I coated them with a teaspoon of butter and some Worcestershire sauce ground mustard garlic powder paprika and salt then toasted them for 25 minutes while the casserole was in the oven (stirring halfway through). Fabulous!",
