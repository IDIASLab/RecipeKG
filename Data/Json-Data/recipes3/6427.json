Also I didn't have any chilli sauce so I substituted a jalepeno and it was perfect. I also added a tomato to the salsa. I'm making these again tonight to impress my mother at another dinner party and they will definately be a staple in my recipe box. Thanks for the great recipe!!!",

                "reviewBody": "This was a wonderful recipe. Following my tradition, I stuck closely to the directions and ingredients so that I could give it a fair review after.  I used canned crabmeat because it was a lot cheaper, and I also used light mayo to cut down on the calories. For anyone else, I would suggest making the salsa with more mango and less onion. The onion amount was a little overpowering, and we stunk afterwards! I think you can also cut down a lot on the mayo amount--just throw two heaping teaspoons in there, and it will be fine.   This is one of the few recipes that takes just a little work, and somehow ends up tasting spectacular. I would even call this recipe \"company worthy.\" One tip--my bowl of crab mixture did NOT make 16 regular crabcakes--it only made 7 small cakes that had medium to low size thickness. The length of the cakes was about the length of the bottom of a water bottle.) It was enough for me and my husband, but if you're cooking for a family, I would suggest doubling the recipe.   This is a great recipe to make when you don't have too much time to cook. You can also adjust some things to make it more healthy--ie: light mayo, wheat breadcrumbs, etc. This was a fulfilling meal that did not make us feel lethargic--we were able to go the gym soon after eating.

I made the crabcakes exactly as written, they formed beautifully and kept their shape nicely while sauteing.  Good ratio of crab to cake, the crab was not overpowered by the other ingredients.  This salsa is excellent, I used jarred mango from the produce isle, which made it a snap to put together.  I drizzled a little EVOO in to keep everything together.  Served over Marrikesh Express mango salsa couscous.  Sincere thanks for a great recipe, well done!  Update 4/9/09 Grilled these on the BBQ last night, that smokey, grilled taste makes them even better.  Held together prefectly.  Just terrific!",
