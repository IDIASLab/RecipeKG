On my first attempt, I found I loved the flavour of the sauce alone, but when mixed into the pasta it was too dry.  Since then, I've doubled the sauce (the peppers, tomatoes & spices, but NOT the beans) and used less pasta (3 cups dry).  I also have a slightly heavier hand with the cheese on top.  Delicious!",

Not dry at all and with lots of flavor--and there definitely wasn't too much cheese even though I increased the amount so much. I did have trouble getting it to fit into a 13x9 casserole dish.
