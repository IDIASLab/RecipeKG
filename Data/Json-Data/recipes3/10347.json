It was a great way to use up leftover ham after the holidays. I find potato soups too \"'heavy \" so I liked how the recipe uses cauliflower to make it lighter with less carbs and more fiber and nutrients. The texture was perfect; thick and creamy but I didn't mash the carrots with the potato and cauliflower and I didn't blend the second can of beans so that there would be more variety of texture and it was great that way. I doubled the recipe and brought it to a potluck where everyone who tried it enjoyed it. The soup goes a long way so I highly recommend it for social gatherings as well as for a home-cooked meal. I will definitely make this recipe again!",
