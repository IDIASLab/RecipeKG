Instead of using butter I used like half the amount of peanut oil (1 tablespoon). I used half shallot/half onion and I cooked them for a really long time on low heat until caramelized then deglazed with white vermouth. I also left out the vinegar. This is a versatile dip but I think the best thing about it is that it can be made extremely low fat and it still tastes great!",
