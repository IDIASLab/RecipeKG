There is a lot of in and out with the pork chops and quite a few steps making this pretty lengthy so plan ahead and allow yourself some extra time. The one thing I did not like was crisping up the chops just to sog them up. Depending on the thickness of your chops you may need to reduce the cook time some. Mine got overdone. Overall a good recipe just a little lengthy.",
