Normally I'd use soy milk for most things, but I've found that in greater quantities it tends to froth badly. Almond milk does not have this problem though! Serve over warmed biscuits or toasted bread of your choice.",

I recently married a woman who is unfortunately lactose intolerant being that my favorite food is biscuits and gravy with sausage and eggs I had to find a way to still enjoy that treat with my wife. I I was very surprised by the Worcestershire sauce and the teaspoon of nutmeg I have never heard of this and I gave it a try anyway. It's really good and I'm just amazed you can make good gravy with almond milk at all. I think next time I will give it a try without the nutmeg and Worcestershire and just do it with just salt and pepper can see which method I prefer. Thank you for posting this really cool recipe.",
