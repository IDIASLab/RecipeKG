Obviously this was a lot less than six cups but the sauce was flavorful and had a lot of body. Also I substituted a pinch of chili powder because I didn't have red chile paste on hand.",

I think that it makes a more authintic cream sauce that way. 4) I definately added more curry powder and garlic for a zesty recipe. With these changes it is definately a keeper for my house!

For that amount of tomato sauce I suggest at least doubling the tofu. As is the tofu was drowning in the curry and so its minced texture was lost. The curry thankfully was awesome so not complaining. Finally the dish had in my opinion a Thai-Indian hybrid flavour.",

And add flaked unsweetened coconut for extra flavor. ALSO since my husband is Indian I use paneer. AWESOME if you can find it. Some Indian (Patel Bros) groceries keep it in their frozen food section. You can also find ready made naan chapathi and paratha that are authentic and taste homemade. But you don t have to do all that work. ALSO veggies I cut down to 1 to 1 1/2 cup total.",
