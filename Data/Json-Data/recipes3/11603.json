Before topping it with cheese, I sprinkled a bit of old bay and red pepper flakes on the stuffed eggplants, and I also added garlic to the entire mix.  I fried the onions with garlic, and then I added more garlic to the mixture.  There is no such thing as too much garlic.",

After cooking the onion, peppers, garlic, tomatoes, and shrimp in olive oil, I melted some gouda and shredded parmesean/asiago mix to the saute. Then I added 2 eggs, fresh red pepper flakes, and some bread crumbs. I also pre-cooked the eggplant by roasting it for about 15 minutes; then, chopped and added to mixture. Stuffed the eggplant and topped with cheddar, parm/asiago mix and a little bread crumb on top. Baked until all brown and cheese gets a little crispy. it was delicious!",

I shredded eggplant and roasted for 20 minutes at 450 degrees. My attempt at mashing eggplant was bad. So it was semi-mashed. I added shrimp, saut\u00e9ed peppers and some jalape\u00f1os with the egg and butter. Then added mozzarella and cheddar to the mix. Mixed it up, put it in a casserole dish and covered the top with cheddar. Cooked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Then 5 minutes in the broiler to toast the top. It was so delicious!!!  The butter was a little too much, but the rest was fantastic!!!",
