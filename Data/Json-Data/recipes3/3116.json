Honestly...I left out the mustard..I had never heard of that....all turned out well without it. Also instead of tomatoe juice I used a cup of prepared caldo de tomate (tomatoe bullion). If you love spanish rice this is your best bet!",

I would recommend simmering for longer so that the rice oinions and peppers have more time to soften. I changed it slightly by foregoing the cup of tomato juice and adding two cans of diced tomatos. With that in mind I will definately make it again. We enjoyed it and I always have the ingredients on hand which makes it easy to make. And it hardly takes any time at all which is another bonus!
