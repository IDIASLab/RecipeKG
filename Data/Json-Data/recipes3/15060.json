My brother and I came about this recipe through trial and error, and bouncing ideas off each other. We love it! This recipe is more about technique than ingredients. Frozen wings are required or they will overcook. The indirect cook time helps dry the sauce so they are not sloppy. You'll still need napkins, but much less mess on the face and hands.",
