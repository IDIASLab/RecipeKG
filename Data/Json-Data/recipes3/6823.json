The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the recipe as it stands is a bit off.   As others have noted, the filling shrinks way down once you \"toss\" it and I ended up having to double it to fill 4 rice papers.   I also followed the advice of many others before me and halved the Teriyaki across the board.   Perfect advice.   Do the hot sauce to your own taste too.  If you like it hot, go with 2 T.   If you want it mild, cut it back to 1 T.   \n\nIf you've never worked with rice paper sheets before, they are a cinch!   Run under the faucet (both sides) and then place on a cutting board 1 or 2 at a time.   Within a minute the paper softens up and gets pliable.   Roll them as TIGHT as possible or they will fall apart when trying to eat later. \n\nThe peanut sauce is AWESOME!!   Mine came out way too thick so I doubled the sesame oil and also added 2-3 T. of water for the right texture.    Again gauge the hot sauce to your own taste.",

If you double or triple the recipe you don't have to do the same with the sauce there was more than enough. Someone in the group was allergic to peanuts and he thought they were great just plain.
