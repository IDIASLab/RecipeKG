You might need to add some more flour to roll & cut out. Bake carefully so they don't burn. To ice: Make a runny icing with icing sugar egg white and lemon juice. When the cookies are still warm dip them into this icing and let dry on a cookie rack. These cookies soften with time. I like to make them at least 3 weeks before Xmas and keep them in a tin with an apple wedge. Thse are our family XMAS favorites!",

I'll try a half-batch next time and use 1 whole egg 1 egg white (to keep the fluffiness). My first batch were really big so us a teaspoon and drop well spaced blobs no bigger than a quarter; they puff up alot. I guess I'm not a big fan of liquorice either so next time I will use vanilla or almond extract to flavour it. I really liked the texture - sortof a marshmallow cookie:). One last thing is that I detected a slight taste of baking soda so maybe cut that down a bit (1 1/2tsp maybe or 3/4tsp for a half batch).",
