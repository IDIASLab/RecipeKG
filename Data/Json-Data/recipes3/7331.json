I also didn't use fresh basil because it costs too much. To make up for the flavor I added dried basil more oregano and some Italian seasoning. I also added some dried red pepper for a little extra spice. I added all of the spices while simmering instead of after so that the tastes could combine. I'm also considering adding the Italian sausage earlier next time so that the flavor mingles. I'm sure I'll make this again!",

The red wine flavor really stands out. I used broken spaghetti as my pasta of choice that I cooked seperately so as not to make the soup too starchy. Fresh spinach and basil are also a must. Delicious healthy and filling. I sprinkled some red hot pepper flakes on mine along with some grated romano cheese. Thanks!",
