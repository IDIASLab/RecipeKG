It is VERY filling, so bring your appetite.  My husband, who almost never has much interest in leftovers, took a double helping to work the next day.  This one goes into the rotation today!",

As others wrote, I substituted sauce for the juice, fresh spinach instead of frozen, and vegetable stock instead of beef or chicken (for lent).. I used dried tortellini instead of fresh or frozen and put them directly in the pot instead of cooking first and then adding to the soup. Seems to have cooked through so, will probably do that again. I love cream of tomato soup so, this is a good addition to our diet. But this made a huge pot of soup! Next time I will cut down on the amounts used. As it stands, will now have to freeze the leftover soup otherwise we will be eating it for 7 days!!",
