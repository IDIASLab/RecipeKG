For one you don't need a half cup of butter in fact because I watch my weight I won't use any butter or butter substitute at all. The cheese makes more than enough oil. Nevertheless the bourban is the bomb!! Meaning the recipe is great I would tweek it a little bit and make it over and over again!!",

Also it did not need to be baked quite as long a recipe states to get chicken fully cooked(was 195 degrees at center after about 45 minutes).",

It just turned out bland even with using 1/2 c bourbon; I felt like it was a waste of good spirits. The chicken was tender enough to cut with a fork but didn't pick up any flavor. I wonder if result would be different if bourbon was mixed in with the soup & cheese mixture. This was definately worth trying though!",
