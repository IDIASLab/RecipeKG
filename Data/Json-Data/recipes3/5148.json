If so this is NOT a side dish type pea... the peas are cooked until completely dehydrated (thus they are hard and crunchy) and meant to be eaten alone as a snack (they also make great additions to salads). The prep and cooking is a little long but these are a great snack and you can make a bunch and freeze some for later. You also CANNOT just put wasabi on peas and dehydrate them and get the same thing... you have to add in other ingredients to get a \"dough\" that will stick to the peas. I skipped the mirepoix part but followed the rest of the recipe and I thought these were great. Next time I will add a little more wasabi as I like my wasabi peas very hot.",

I did think they needed more wasabi which is an easy fix but the main problem I had was with the appearance. After so much cook time there was basically no green left in the peas. It looked like a cookie sheet fully of bunny turds. I was talking to a lady at work that makes them all of the time and she suggested a couple of things so I thought I'd try again. She said she never soaks the peas overnight or cooks them for an hour. Instead she basically starts at step 4 in this recipe. She gets the paste together and then gently mixes the freeze dried peas in until they are coated in the paste. She then only bakes them for one hour. I tried again with her method and not only did they come out better but they were way less time consuming. It's hard to give a fair rating on this one. They do work as written but they work better simplified. You be the judge...",
