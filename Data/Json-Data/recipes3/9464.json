My background is a transplanted guy from NJ who has now lived in TX for about 30 years and had never heard of the blackeyed pea tradition on New Years for good luck. Well you speak of blackeyed peas here and there is no getting around \"Hoppin' John\" as the primary way to serve them. With the name of the dish it seemed to me that it should be at least lively. In all my time here all the recipes I came upon just turned out to be \"Limping John\" at best (some just \"Stumblin' John\" of \"John On His Knees Not Able to Go On After Celebrating\") I really did like this change of pace from all my other attempts. I followed instructions almost exactly (I usually do it to a tee If I would dare to review as given). I upped the garlic by two more cloves since that is my bent ahem. I also went to the market and could not find anything labeled \"Cajun Seasoning\" except for a huge canister of Ragin' Cajun brand which was more than I would need before it probably would spoil so I opted for well known Creole Seasoning which you probably all know about. In any case the end product was delicious and I am saving this one for New Years to come.",
