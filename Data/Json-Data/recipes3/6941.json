I was afraid it would taste too strongly of rosemary if it was chopped in both the relish and on the fish. I did not have cherry tomatoes so I diced regular tomatoes. I also grilled it on a wood plank for about 10 minutes then directly on the grill for a few minutes on each side. The relish was a great compliment to the fish! Thanks for the great recipe- I can't wait to make it again!",

Hubs the grill master believes it was the marinading that took away from how good this COULD have been. Once put on the grill the olive oil just flowed out of the meat preventing it from browning nicely. He said the filets should be dry then rubbed lightly with olive oil just before grilling on a hot grill which would then also require less than the directed time - and they also need a good squeeze of lemon. The relish on the other hand was just delicious. Great fresh flavor and colors but I think it could be put to better use with something other than this fish. I served this with a seasoned couscous which we've finally concluded we don't like. I should have made the rice pilaf I had originally planned on.",

The corn and tomato relish could and WILL be used with other dishes and also just as a side dish. One of the great things about living here in South Dakota at this time of year is the most wonderful tasting sweet corn fresh off the farm. Using sweet corn really gave this relish a nice taste. I did not alter the recipe and I don't feel like I would need to add or take anything out...it's great! 9/17/08 I made the relish as a side dish tonight and it was great....be sure to use sweet corn and not field or frozen corn (or add a touch of sugar to the mix)!",
