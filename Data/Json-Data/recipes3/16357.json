This recipe while not hard is definitely more work intensive than the microwave method. However IMO this fudge has a better texture. As another microwave fudge cooker wrote this recipe gets thick pretty much too thick to stir. I agree this one is a solid upper body workout however instead of discarding the recipe I recommend adding a generous splash (about 1/2-3/4 C of evaporated milk) while stirring. This really helped the texture issue. Next I added 1/2 C of Bailey's. I still did not find the Bailey's flavor strong enough so next time I shall add 1/2 C evaporated milk while stirring and 1 C of Bailey's afterwards. Methinks that shall be perfect.",
