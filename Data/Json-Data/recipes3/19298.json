I mixed up the sour cream and sherry (using extra sherry) and added the Rosemary and Thyme.  I also added basil and chives from previous members tips. I stirred in the sauteed onions, garlic and celery. Then I poured the whole thing over the chicken breast and cooked on low for 6-7 hours. Served over Penne pasta. Awesome!

Took the advice from others and I added some crushed garlic and diced onions when I browned the chicken. Also added a can on mushrooms (didn't have fresh). I deglazed the sherry in the pan getting up all the bits of garlic and chicken from the pan. That helps take away the alcohol taste if you're worried about that. I had to use up a sour cream container so this was perfect. I did forget to add the butter in the mixture so I added it in the baking pan in bits and pieces and did my best trying to mix it. Overall it's a good recipe nice twist on the traditional cream of mushroom style. Will try again with added veggies.",
