I preheated the oven to 350 and used a metal baking tray covered in foil.  I snapped the legs to break the bone so that I could place the chicken flatter and also, so that the spices would permeate the chicken better.  After 45 minutes I took the tray out and removed the foil.  I used chicken scissors to cut thru the skin because I knew that this way the barbeque sauce would penetrate inside the chicken better.  I used about 1 cup of barbeque sauce \"Tony Roma's Brand\".  After 15 minutes I turned off the oven...but I left the chicken inside for another 5 minutes.  Then I took it out and it tasted marvelous!  It was fall off the bone tender like the other people said.  A very sucussful recipe!  Next time I will line the bottom of the baking tray with a sheet of foil so that I dont have to scrub the tray so much during   \r\ndish washing.  This is an excellent template for just about any baked chicken recipe whether it be barbeque chiken or herb roasted chicken or pretty \r\nmuch any baked chicken recipe that does not  \r\nrequire you to de-bone the chicken.",

I used only chx drumsticks as that's all I had on hand 6 of them to be exact so maybe less meat than a whole chicken. I did not scale back on the BBQ sauce as I love sauce! I just eyeballed it so I think I may have used more like 2 cups......There was actually a good deal of liquid in the dish after 60 min. (I turned the chicken over at 30 min) so I had no problem with clean up. I poured off most the liquid before brushing with the sauce then continued for another 30 min. as the recipe calls for. The meat was already pulling back from the bone after the 1st hour so I turned the oven down to 245 degrees for the 30 min. with sauce. I was afraid it would be too dry but since I was cooking for myself and left overs I went ahead with the recipe's cooking time to test it out. The meat was juicy and flavorful and not the least bit dry. I did end up pulling the skin off before eating so I think I'd just do away with it in the beginning next time. Other than that I'd happily cook this for a crowd any night!",

It's pretty basic - as another reviewer pointed out, it'll be exactly as tasty as the sauce you use - but as a cooking method, it works nicely.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, baked them covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for another 15.  Also, I messed up and added the barbecue sauce in the beginning; it still turned out okay, but next time I'd like to try it as written, and see how it turns out.  I used pre-made grilled chicken seasoning, garlic powder and a little cayenne, as well as salt and pepper, to flavor the chicken.  On a side note:  nonstick aluminum foil is the best invention since slow-cooker liners.  Seriously.  Buy it.  ",

He loved it and said it was the best BBQ chicken he has ever had...although he isn't a picky eater his least favorite food is BBQ but not anymore!! So simple too I used a whole chicken the first time and the second time I cut it directly in half down the breast bone and found it cooked better and more flavorful the second time but I attribute that to the wonderful Easy BBQ sauce I found here by Debi K....it was AWESOME. Can't ask for an easier meal and if you use foil in the pan it makes really easy clean up too!! Thanks for making my dinner menus more diverse!",
