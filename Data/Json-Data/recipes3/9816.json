But when I discovered I had no egg noodles I thought I would use fettuccine instead... than realized I didn't have enough fettuccine, so I added in some angel hair pasta.  I was also hoping to add frozen broccoli, carrots, cauliflower mix and was out of those.  Last minute I added a handful of fresh spinach.  The sauce is very rich and wonderful. Once done I added some fresh Parmesan and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again and add different veggies to the mix, but the basic recipe would be perfect all by itself.
