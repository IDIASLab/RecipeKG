The shrimp and corn went in together along with the little neck clams we decided to include in this amazing dinner. We fed a crowd of thirteen people while on vacation last week and everyone raved about this great summer dish. A salad and a loaf of crusty bread rounded out this authentic southern meal. Give it a try, there's nothing not to like. Thanks so much Kim!!!!",

This is a per person calculation so just multiply the number of people times each of the items and it works out great.  1/2 pound shrimp 1/2 pound sausage (we used Andouille or smoked Kielbasa) 1 ear of corn 1 potato (or 3 to 4 small red potatoes) 1 large onion  Served with sweet tea or ice cold beer!!!  We used the pour over newspaper on picnic tables method of serving.  Be sure to put out plenty of rolls of paper towels to use for napkins.  This is the low country at its best!",

My son has been requesting it for dinner since before he could even say \"sausage\" and it's always been his favorite. I agree with others who suggest waiting to add the corn until just before the shrimp otherwise it will overcook while you wait for the potatoes to cook thoroughly. And a tablespoon or two of Old Bay really does give it just the right taste! Another option is to brown the smoked sausage slices before adding them in with the potatoes. We prefer it that way. A great meal to serve outdoors and with lots of napkins as you eat the shrimp and corn with your hands!",
