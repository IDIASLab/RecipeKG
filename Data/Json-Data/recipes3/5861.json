Mine was loaded from top to bottom.\nI skipped the honey completely and added more egg (I never measure my quiche mix. It's just habit). \nI tossed the carrots and nuts with the cheese before filling with the egg mixture. Since I had enough to fill 2-3 shells, I added spinach to one shell. Fantastic.\n\ngreat idea on flavors--the technique just needed a litle tweaking.",
