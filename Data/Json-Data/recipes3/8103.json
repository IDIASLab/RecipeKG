UPDATE:: After said an done this recipe was quite good for a low sugar low fat recipe. I couldn't bring myself to use 3 TBLS of cinnamon an vanilla or measure my zucchini per se but it wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping. Thought the texture was great really tried to drain every drop out. Also had the delight in using homemade reduced sugar applesauce. It's unfortunate that the first reviewer had to start it off with such a downcast appearance. Def deserving of more than 1 star!! thank you for sharing",
