My in-laws who are usually very resistant to trying anything new and different devoured it and were asking for the recipe. Mine was a little on the blander side because I only used 1 jalapeno and removed all the seeds and ribs because I didn't want it to be too spicy. So I had to re-season it with some salt pepper and garlic powder after it was refrigerated. So just like the recipe states - taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking. I would make this again!",
