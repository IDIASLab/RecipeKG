Just like rice pilaf, the grains of rice get coated in fat before absorbing the cooking liquid, ensuring plump, tender, separate grains with no sticky clumps. Just adjust cooking time if using a different kind of rice or pan size. Garnish with green onions and serve with a runny poached egg on top if desired.",

Going to make it again soon but try out chicken instead of ham for something different. Thank you so much Chef John for such a tasty recipe!",

I was a little worried about the amount of sesame oil but it was perfect.  I can imagine using rotisserie chicken or roast pork instead of the ham with the same results. This tastes better than home-made fried rice and there is very little mess to clean up. Hubby gave it a thumbs up and can't wait to have the leftovers with the poached egg on top.  Thanks for another great recipe.",
