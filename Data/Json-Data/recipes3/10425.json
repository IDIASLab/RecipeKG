I didn't have cream of celry soup but I did have cream of mushroom soup and heavy cream.  I did finely chop a stalk of celry and put it in the recipe. I added two tbsp of lemon juice. I added a tbsp of old bay seasoning, I added 3 cups of frozen spinach. I doubled the recipe because I had a little over 1 1/2 pounds of fish. I have some extra garlic croutons and crushed them and added them to the top of the cheese. It turned out totally delicious!",
