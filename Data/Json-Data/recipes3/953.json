One 9 inch w/ home made crust and one 9 inch store bought crust (that I happened to have on hand!) One note of caution for those using store bought crusts. Even though they say 9 inches I have found that these have a much smaller 'filling' capacity than if you make your own in a 9 inch pan. As a result you may end up with more filling than crust - and a much smaller pie/serving amount. I was even able to fit the entire 9 inch store bought crust into my 9 inch oven pan (and still had room in it). I also had a leftover lime (from some coronas over the weekend!) that I took and thinly sliced and used as a garnish over the pies. Hope this is helpful to everyone!",

The texture of this frozen pie is very nice. It doesn't freeze up as hard as other recipes I have made before. It stays somewhat soft which I appreciated. I always toast graham cracker crusts in the oven at 400 degrees for about 8 minutes to make them taste fresher. I also made this recipe using frozen raspberry lemonade concentrate instead and mixed in a few frozen raspberries. That was also quite nice.",
