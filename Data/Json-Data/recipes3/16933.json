Even my 2 and 4 year olds and even pickier husband liked it! I used 3 cups chicken broth and 1 can beer. next time I will use both cans of beer. My husband took half of the soup and ran it thru the food processor and added some sour cream because he wanted it smooth and more creamy. Either way tasted pretty good. A quick tasty dinner. Will make this again for sure!",
