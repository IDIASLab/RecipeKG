I don't see where this recipe says to drain and press water from the tofu that seems like a critical step... I used firm tofu and I added some Italian spice nutmeg pepper and nutritional yeast. I topped the lasagna with vegan cheese when it was nearly done cooking and returned it to the oven to melt. Delicious!",
