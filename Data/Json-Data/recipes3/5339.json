I chopped the carrots instead of grating them vegetable broth and I used whole wheat cous cous bought in bulk at the natural food store (way cheaper). I did a mix of green onions and regular onion since I had just a little of both around. I loved how easy it was to make this dish-- probably 15 minutes start to finish.",

If the dish as written is bland, you can definitely add some spices to it that will make it more \"Moroccan,\" (which is some of the best food on earth!!)  Also, I checked out the Mixed Grill recipe, and it contains pork, which is definitely NOT Moroccan.  Maybe some lamb shanks or shoulder cut into pieces.  Chicken is also very good with carrots.  For the spices, first, I wouldn't make parsley optional, I would make it required, and also some cilantro.  Also, try adding some ginger, paprika, and cumin - all to your taste.  You can also go a different route completely with it, and add some cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, a little saffron, and a little powdered sugar, and if you're adventurous, some dried apricots (remove garlic if you go this route).  For cooking it, cook the couscous separately, but in the chicken broth.  Let the onions cook until soft, then and add the carrots and spices, some water (and meat if you want it), and let this cook for a while on a low heat, covered, until the onions become saucy, they should be almost disintegrated when it's done and the carrots should be soft.  Turn the meat once in a while, and stir the sauce.  If it gets dry, you can add a little water to it while it cooks, and also at the end, if too saucy, remove the lid and let some of the water evaporate.  Serve over couscous, or eat with pita bread.  Again, I haven't mad",
