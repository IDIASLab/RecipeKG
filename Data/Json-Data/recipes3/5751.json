There were about 4-5 generous servings. I'd like to make this again and include the pine nuts & artichokes. This would also be great with roasted eggplant/zucchini and broccoli or paired with grilled chicken.

Instead of Parmesan I used nutritional yeast and replaced the feta (often made with cow's milk in the US) with crumbled goat cheese. I also didn't have quite 2 cups of basil so I put a little extra tomatoes in instead. I left the final product a little chunkier so that I could add it to pasta. I tossed the pesto with penne pasta and wine-sauted (savignon blanc) mushrooms for an oh-so-delicious dish that I served with baked chicken. I think I'll make a double batch next time to freeze. I've read up on freezing pesto and the best I've seen is to fill ice cub trays with the pesto and top with plastic wrap (so that it touches the pesto) and freeze. Once frozen put the cubes in a freezer bag and use as necessary. I can't wait to try it!",
