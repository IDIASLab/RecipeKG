Used 5 10\" flour tortillas rather than the smaller ones and they fit perfectly in the 9\" x 13\" baking dish. One 10\" enchilada is filling so this dish should serve 5 adult appetites. Made Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce from this site in lieu of using the recipe s jar Alfredo sauce. Next time I would go with an authentic Alfredo sauce that doesn't use cream cheese even if it takes a little more time (e.g. Buttery Alfredo Sauce from this site).",
