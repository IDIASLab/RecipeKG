I like that it was easy quick ingredients.\" Having everything on hand I reduced the recipe's ingredients to 1 serving or 2 chicken tenderloins for myself for lunch. There was plenty of the mayo mixture to cover the one side of the chicken with the s&p underside as directed in the recipe and the end result was a bit heavy on the slippery texture and a bit light on the flavor. It wasn't bad by all means and it tasted good over a green salad; maybe adding parmesan to the mayo would kick it up some.",
