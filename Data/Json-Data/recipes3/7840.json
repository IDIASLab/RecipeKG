                "reviewBody": "I made them for a party. This recipe makes about 2 dozen and my plate was empty early on! I got lots of compliments! Originally I was just going to use the corned beef spread on Ritz crackers. The 'puff' part frightened me. I'm not a baker and have never done anything with dough besides roll it out of a can. In reading the puffs recipe it didn't sound difficult and I had the ingredients on hand so I figured why not? I will tell you the puffs were very easy to make turned out delicious and make a terrific presentation when you put this plate down. The dough is sticky but manageable. When dropped by teaspoon onto the baking sheet they tend to have points and irregular shapes. Not bad but next time I may try forming them a little bit. I did add a wee bit more mayo and horseradish to the corned beef but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The corned beef spread is tasty too! Nice to make it ahead of time too! Thank you for a super recipe!",
