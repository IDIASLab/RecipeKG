I was only making a small dinner for two so I had one large breast and put all ingredients in a small crock after pouring the butter mixture over the veggies. I then sliced some lemon for on top of the ingredients. Fabulous! November 13 2017: I made this again and used two chicken breasts fresh ginger garlic zest and made my own butter mixture with brown sugar cinnamon etc. AGAIN FABULOUS RECIPE!",
