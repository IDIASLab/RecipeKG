I added more eggs 2 mor ein fact to get teh flour to mix and incorporate. I wish now that I would have used a little milk or water. The noodles are not bad but I think the addition of the eggs may have made them a bit more chewy than I would have liked. If you use this recipe I would try using a little milk if it is too dry. How much will probably depend on your egg size. I used large eggs and still ended up using 2 additional eggs. All in all... they didnt taste too bad.. but I won't use this one again.",
