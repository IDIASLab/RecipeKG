I've heavily modified the original recipe and like this variation SO much more! It's relatively easy. This makes a medium-hot salsa. I've named it 'Red-Ribbon' because it took second place at my company salsa competition last Cinco de Mayo (lost first in a tie-breaker!).",

I only had 3 chipotle peppers so I did add some jalapenos because we like it spicy (and spicy it is!! We're breathing fire over here!). I also added a can of tomatoes with green chilies because I was short on tomatoes. I bet it would be even better with all fresh tomatoes. Thanks for an awesome recipe. It's going to be a regular around here now.",
