Other than that I prepared this right down the list of ingredients, exactly as written.  I was encouraged at each addition, liking every ingredient in the mix.  And then I tasted it... and was unimpressed.  It tasted like a doctored up common burger sauce or Thousand Island dressing masquerading as a \"Southwest\" dressing, the sweetness of the ketchup very apparent and disagreeable.  Moments after I tasted it I was already planning my review, indicating this sweetness and what I might do differently, perhaps using tomato sauce or tomato paste rather than ketchup to combat the sweetness and/or adding a little hot sauce.  But by the time I used it on my salad (lettuce, slow cooked shredded chicken, sliced avocado, tomatoes, green onion, black olives and shredded Mexican-blend cheese), magic had happened!  The flavors had indeed mellowed out and combined, resulting in a complex but balanced dressing with the initial sweetness gone.  It was not only much improved, it was just right.  In fact, this was spot on, and I just can't see messing around with it at all.  DO include everything, including the cilantro, which gave this freshness and a tease of its flavor.  The dressing just wouldn't be the same (meaning as GOOD) without it.",
