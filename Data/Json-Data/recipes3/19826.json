I added more garlic, more honey, and a mix of red,black and white peppers, salt, nutmeg, and dry mustard. I also added a tablespoon of dijon to the egg mix. WONDERFUL!!!!",

A whole chicken is too much for us, so I marinated the rest in the fridge for the next day.  For the basting sauce, I used 2 egg yolks, 4x honey and 1 stick butter.  This was an absolute hit with the family. I've been asked to make it every week.  Thanks for sharing!",

Mix the egg with the salt garlic powder and pepper in a bowl and dip the chicken into the mixture (rather than rubbing the seasoning on the chicken and then brushing on the egg). It's much quicker. 2.) I double the sauce (except for the butter) and pour whole thing over the chicken. Baste a couple of times while baking 3.) I don't use a whole chicken (just personal preference). I use 5 chicken breasts. Thank you for the recipe!",

I am not an experienced cook so I like something that I can work with when I try to make dinner.Thanks for the recipe!!!",

It is simple and quick. The oven does the work. You only have to turn the chicken over and brush on sauce once. Just purchase a cut-up chicken from your local store so you don't have to do all that work. Very yummy indeed!",

I used 1.25 lb pkg chicken breasts. Didn't measure the spices and added parsley cayenne nutmeg and Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle. I went ahead and used 2 yolks 2.5 tbs lemon juice cut the butter to 2 tbs and upped the honey to just under 1/2 cup. Marinated all day. Baked covered at 350 for an hour. Then I followed Azra's suggestion of letting the chicken sit for a few minutes and drizzling it with more honey. Trying it before I did that with all the honey I already used - yeah. FOLLOW THAT TIP!
