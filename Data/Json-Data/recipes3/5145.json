We tried it with and without and it is WAY better with those 4 ingredients, which are not in the other corn dip recipes.  The only thing I changed is using EQUAL amounts of mayo and sour cream (2 cups each).  I also one time had no lime or lemon juice so I substituted a WHOLE 2 OZ. BOTTLE of GREEN TABASCO (officially called McIlhenny Brand Green Pepper Sauce) and it was even better!  The green sauce is not really spicy but adds the tang that you need for this to not be too bland.  I think I may do that from now on as it seemed even better than with the lime juice.  YUM YUM!",

Regardless, I have been in the SW my whole life, so maybe my expectations/tastes are a little different. It didn't matter what I did or added to this dip (cold, heated, salsa, chili powder, garlic, black beans, etc.), it just was not exciting and was certainly nothing I would go out of my way for. It was just kind of a blob of too much white and yellow stuff with no interesting flavors. I would never make this again let alone serve it to anyone. Can't give it one star, because it was edible and not atrocious, just not something to get all \"yippee\" about...not at all. I just don't understand the raves. Oh, well, different keeps for different peeps. I say, don't waste your time and calories. If you are a west coaster, steer clear.",
