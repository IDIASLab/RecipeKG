I have made this three times for parties and it is mostly enjoyed. The most common complaint is the salad doesn't have enough dressing for the amount of potatoes called for. While I have increased the amount of dressing I also found it helpful to be certain the size of your potato cubes is kept small; it's amazing what a difference it makes to the texture of the overall salad. The red onions are a nice touch of color and strength! So to summarize we enjoy this different type of potato salad. It seems consistent that increased dressing is called for by those eating it adjust your potato size as desired and enjoy!",
