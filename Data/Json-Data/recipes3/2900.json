In Sicily this is called braciole and typically stuffed with raisins and pine nuts. In Italy this is called involtini, and is sometimes stuffed with a mixture of bread crumbs, Romano cheese and eggs - or with carrots, onions, celery, garlic and parsley. A variation I often make is with garlic, prosciutto, fresh basil leaves and Romano. (Which is also how I recently enjoyed this dish in Rome) No matter how it's stuffed these beef rolls are braised for about 1-1/2 hours in tomato sauce, and usually with beef stock, red wine and garlic added. This version, while maybe not traditional, is a perfectly acceptable short-cut variation.",
