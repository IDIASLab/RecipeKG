I microwaved the potatoes - let cool and scooped out the insides - then sprayed the skins with cooking spray and into a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes to get crispy. The meat & chili seasoning needs to have some water added and then cooked together. I used Kraft slices as that is what I had on hand. (Cheddar or Jack would work well too.) I put a slice on the inside of each skin and then mixed some with the chili meat and then some on top. Mashed the taters with butter and milk sprinkled with paprika.",

Also I think if your someone who's trying to have a small party game night etc.... you should really consider making this appetizer because it is a good appetizer to serve while their waiting on the big meal to be done but if your trying to cook potato skins as a meal for dinner or something the only thing to me that would go good with it would be a steak. Lastly potato skins are very easy to make so I recommend it to everyone.",

Since it needed to simmer for a few minutes to absorb the flavor I added chicken stock. I did not fry the potato skins I baked them for a few minutes. I also added fresh chopped scallions to the top once it was done baking. Much better. Now it's five stars!!!",
