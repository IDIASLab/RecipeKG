The previous reviewer is correct- the consistency when you are done boiling it is similar to cream of mushroom soup and is not asthetically pleasing. However once it cools it resembles lemon meringue in consistency. And the taste is wonderfully rich and buttery! I topped it with cool whip sprinkled some Heath candy pieces on top and drizzled chocolate sauce over it. It looked great and tasted delicious! Will definitely make again.",

Also I only boiled mine for 2.5 hours not 4. The caramel was a perfect consistency and tasted great. I also took a handful of chocolate chips and stirred them into the caramel when it was still hot so they melted and gave it a nice chocolaty taste. Just be careful when opening the cans. Wait until they've cooled down enough to where you can hold it in your hand and not burn yourself. Then after you puncture the can with the can opener wait a second for the air (and a bit of caramel) to escape before you continue opening otherwise you'll have caramel on your ceiling.",
