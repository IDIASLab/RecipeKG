I removed beef and set aside while I sauteed chopped onion and mushrooms. I added large carrots and celery pieces chopped potatoes frozen green beans and frozen peas. (skipped the cabbage) I cut back broth to 32 oz. I added about 1 TB Worcestershire sauce also. I covered the pot and placed in 350 degree oven for at least an hour. I removed the celery and carrot pieces and pureed them in a blender. I mixed a little corn starch with the pureed veggies and returned to pot. This thickened up the stew a bit. My husband loved it.",

I cut back on the amount of beef broth by one can.  It made my dish thicker.  I omiited the cabbage completely.  I added 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and it gave it such a great flavor!!!!  I added a little bit of garlic clove too.  It enhances the stew without making it garlicky.  You won't have any leftovers!",
