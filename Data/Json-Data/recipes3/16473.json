I used 2/3 cup soy milk and about 1 1/2 cups pepperjack cheese which gave it a nice kick. I added mushrooms a little dry mustard and a little nutmeg. And finally instead of the crust I used the mandolin to slice some sweet potatoes and made a 'crust' out of that. I probably used about 2 tbsp olive oil in the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. I cooked it on the bottom rack at 400 for about 45 minutes until the sweet potatoes looked golden brown from the bottom. Yumminess!",

I have played around with it a bit at times adding different seasonings or different cheeses but have remained true to the original poster. This is a keeper and great for breakfast brunch lunch dinner picnics you name it. As a vegetarian it was an easy to make meal that tasted great and I couldn't taste the tofu. In fact I don't necessarily like the taste of raw tofu but if you compare that to say chicken or any other meat that you simply stuck in the oven without proper preparation or seasoning you probably would say it tasted pretty bad too. If you are unsure about it honestly try it once before saying that you don't like it. It's a great dish that everyone will enjoy. Just save yourself some grief and don't tell anyone that it has tofu in it.:) UPDATE: I highly recommend prebaking the crust for at least 10 minutes to get your crust to hold up well for this recipe. If you don't it's ok but it is even better when it is prebaked.",
