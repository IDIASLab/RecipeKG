Also, for those of you willing to try, this recipie works well with phyllo dough. Just brush melted butter over top of brie, then add preserves, and wrap in 4 sheets of phyllo that have also been brushed with butter. Trim excess dough and freeze. This is very important and should also be done with the puff pastry version. If you don't freeze, the cheese is completely liquid by the time the dough is done, and so this way they both come out perfect. Bake according to package directions.",

I know there are some cheese connaisseurs out there who think different. P.S. If your pastry comes out soggy or greasy, you need to up your oven temp to 400 because it means your pastry is melting and not \"puffing\".",

Mine must have had a small crack or hole...because when it came out of the oven..all of the brie and almonds had made this lovely crunchy mass next to the puff pastry mound and had left barely anything in the inside of the pastry.  So be sure to close up the holes.  It all tasted really good though...regardless of its fragmented presentation.",
