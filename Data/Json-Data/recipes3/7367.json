If you do decide to cook them in a crockpot then they will take typically 7 hours or more on high. If the peanuts are taking a very long time on the stove like one reviewer stated you possibly purchased peanuts not meant for boiling. Make sure you have not purchased roasted peanuts. Typically the correct peanuts at places like Walmart will have indications of boiling on the package.",

Every now and then, I like to make a batch of them to enjoy with an icy soft drink. This recipe has some good flavor ideas within. However, I felt quite a bit more salt was needed for the brine. And for our preferences; I will double the rest of the other ingredients next time because we like it spicy. The cook time was spot-on for raw peanuts. I will definitely make again with these changes. A very good base to start.",
