The recipe says to cook the chicken add garlic add sauce then add chicken. I didn't remove the chicken and add it again. I left it in the pot and added Ragu 2lbs) and half and half (about 6 oz) I also added about 1/4 tsp of sugar to cut the acid in the sauce. The mozzarella wasn't really necessary. I added it at the end but it would have been great without it. I did add the parmesan. Also the spinach really does cook down so don't be afraid to add alot. This is definitely a \"keeper\" recipe great to serve when company is coming and you want something delicious and different.",

Fat is good for carrying flavor to the tongue. Generally the more fat you have the better flavor is carried but only to a point. Once you cross that point it just tastes like fat and nothing else. To improve this recipe I would a) use about half the prescribed cream b) switch the mozzarella for parmesan and c) add spices! (basil oregano black pepper and double the garlic). Also use a 4-6 qt saucepan instead of a skillet so that you can add the spinach all at once lest it lose its flavor while you're waiting for some of it to reduce so that you can add more (my 12\" iron skillet wasn't big enough). Even with my modifications I doubt this recipe has the complexity and ingenuity to get any more than 3 or 3.5 stars.",

I took advice from previous reviewers and I added 1/2 cup grated parmesan to the finished sauce and I also used half and half instead of heavy cream. The sauce came out very creamy and thickened nicely. I also doubled the garlic and used frozen chopped spinach. It made a lot of sauce and for once a recipe that says it served 4 actually did. This would also be yummy without the chicken as it took my husband several bites before he realized the chicken was even in there. Great recipe I'm definitely keeping this one!",
