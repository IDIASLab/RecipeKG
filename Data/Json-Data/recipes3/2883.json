I have cooked with beans before and don't know why I didn't do this. I also used a ton more cilantro omitted the picante and added lemon juice. As I am attempting to replicate a bean dip from the best local Mexican restaurants in Pgh I put the mixture into a blender...it's gross looking but tastes good. I will also bake it to get it warm (preference) and serve with blue corn chips. I hope that this works!",

I thought it had a really good flavor I may add more beans or less picante because it was a little too watery. Or add shredded cheese to thicken it up. My husband wants to try to add chicken...? But it had a great flavor and it was super easy. For me these are all items I almost always have on hand too!",
