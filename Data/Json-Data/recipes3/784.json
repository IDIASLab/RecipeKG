Spoon small mounds of remaining batter over the top. Return to oven 6-8 min. You may have to adjust baking time the second time depending on your oven. It's also best to let it sit for several hours or overnight for before cutting.",

When I melted the caramels in the microwave I added 2/3 cup evap milk (to make up for what I didn't put in the batter originally) poured that over the baked dough sprinkled the choc. chips on the caramel sprinkled the nuts over that (used walnuts) and then plopped 'piles' of remaining batter over the toppings- didn't try to spread it out at all. I ended up cooking this for much longer than the recipe states- started with 15 minutes and checked it 5-10 min. intervals until it wasn't 'jiggly' anymore- I think I ended up cooking it for about 35 minutes. Keep an eye on it as it's cooking and you'll be ok. These are DECADENT and delicious!!!!!!!!! Thanks for a great dessert!!",

I was kind of confused because there wasnt much dough left over for the top but I found that through cooking it spread out and in the end this is a great looking dessert!",

I used pecans instead of walnuts because my husband loves pecans.

When I'm a little short on caramel chips I've also substituted a bit of caramel ice cream topping to make up the difference & there is no difference in the end product. I did follow several reviewer's advice to pour 2/3 of the mix (not 1/2) in the pan to bake the first time (bake 6 - 8 minutes or until top no longer shiny) then at the end I add the remaining 1/3 of the mix (not 1/2) on top of the caramel nuts & chips & bake an additional 6 - 8 minutes to finish it off!",
