So i ended up serving it in a bowl with cream on top so that the fam would eat it. Vanilla ice cream would also work. Great thing is that that it was hit. The not so great thing is that it s a lot of paleo ingredients to end up not making it paleo. There are other carrot cake-ish recipes here that would be better to tweak into carrot cake cookies. I was hoping this would be my go-to alternative for carrot cake but the search continues. If anyone know of a great way to to make carrot cake cookies that actually keep their shape let me know!",
