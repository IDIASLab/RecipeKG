Basic and simple was just what I was after today (didn\u2019t want to do a whole lot of monkeying around ) and this really panned out.  How, I asked myself, does one run of out yellow mustard?  I mean, think of the advance notice/warning one is given.   Dijon had to take its place and it was a most pleasant substitution, tho\u2019  I have no doubt the yellow mustard would have been equally as good as well as given the potato salad that characteristic creamy yellow color.  I thought this would be too mayonnaise-y, preparing in advance to add some sour cream if necessary.  It wasn\u2019t.  I thought it would be kind of blah, what with only salt and pepper for the seasoning, and was prepared to add other seasonings (dill was in the back of my mind).  It was anything but.  The flavor of the creamy potatoes I used coupled with the teensiest bite from the green onion, was all the good fresh flavor it needed.  When I think of most potato salads, with all their add-ins, this one seems like the best kept secret in Idaho.  (pun definitely not intended as I used small, new red potatoes) As this recipe\u2019s first reviewer, I\u2019m happy to give it two thumbs up.",

We had leftover bacon so I crumbled in a couple slices as well as chopped up one dill pickle and a splash of pickle juice. I like the little bit of dill and garlic from the pickle. Next time I'll add some sliced radishes my Mom always put that in her potato salads. I added the recommended paprika as well. A true classic thanks for sharing your recipe!:)",
