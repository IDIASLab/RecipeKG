I was raised by my Polish grandmother and my Russian grandfather and meals like this were just about always a staple food. I'd almost forgotten how good these tasted. We'd have these over macaroni when my Grams didn't have time to bake. Sometimes my 'Djeda' (Russian for Grampa) replaced the fresh cabbage with saurkraute because he loved to cook even more than my Grams. Any which way that was decided to eat this meal it was always fantastic. Thank you for bringing back many cherished memories with this great recipe.",
