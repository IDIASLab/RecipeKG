I calculated about 310 calories per serving, but that is because I needed more oil since doing zucchini in batches.",

I cooked on medium but I still had to rinse the pan with some hot water in between batches to avoid scorched garlic. I also don't usually have fresh basil so I subtituted dry basil. My bottle said 1 Tablespoon of fresh = 1 teaspoon of dry. I figured it did not matter because it was going to be baked anyway in this recipe. I ate the gratin with a ribeye steak that day. It takes a little time but it did make an elegant meal. The second time I tried another quicker version. I roasted the first 3 ingredients in the oven first. After about 20 minutes or when the zucchini was very lightly browned I removed from the oven and added the rest of the ingredients and then baked the additonal amount of time. It did not display as well as the original recipe but equally as tasty! Interesting recipe thanks for submitting Phil.",

Works really nicely with feta cheese if you are feta cheese lover. I sprinkle the feta on top of the zucchini and tomatoes and basil than cover the whole thing in a layer of Moz cheese.

The zucchini is just as much of a star as the tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. I also love that the ingredients are those that I usually have on hand. Very easy to prepare pretty presentation and delicious. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding approx. 1/4 cup of italian bread crumbs to the cheese/basil topping. I will happily prepare this often. Thanks for sharing!",
