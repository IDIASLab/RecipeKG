Still awesome!\nFirst review in 2005:\n\n\n\nThis was wonderful.  I assembled a full 24 hours ahead of time and then baked and served on Christmas morning.  I used a smaller pan, the oval Corning dish, as suggested by another reviewer.  It was wonderful that way.  I also put in oneless egg, per everyone's recommendations.",
