I put in an equal amount of White Zinfandel wine - used it to deglaze the pan after browning as someone else suggested. I added 2 TBSP of Worchestershire sauce because we like it. I did let the meat simmer for about an hour before adding the potatoes and carrots to ensure the meat was tender! It was DELICIOUS! This will definitely be a keeper and one that I prepare often. Plus, it is easy to prepare and takes little time except for the cooking! Thanks for a great recipe!",

Like many reviewers I browned the meat first and put that along with everything else in the crockpot. I didn't make any changes except adding two garlic cloves and about 1/2 lb. of fresh green beans that needed to be used. Sadly I didn't realize I had no thyme until I was almost done making this. I bet it would be even better with thyme. The stew got nice and thick and I didn't have to add any extra flour. Was very flavorful too. My only complaint was that it was a little salty and I used reduced-sodium broth and added no extra salt. Next time I'd use one can of salt-free tomatoes. I bet the leftovers will be great!
