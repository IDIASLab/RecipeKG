Everyone liked it. \nIt does have a bitter taste, u know, the oysters and chedder cheese together. I can see how not everyone is fond of the flavor. You'd have to really like oysters I guess.\nI added an ingredient topping it with Frenches fried onions. And to keep them from burning I set the oven temp about 50 degees less. \nIm making this again, and next time im using Cambells nacho cheese soup instaed of just regular cheddar cheese soup. I want the Zing!    ",
