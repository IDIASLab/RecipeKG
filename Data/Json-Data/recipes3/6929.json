It was not a stand out, but was saved at the dinner table by some Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce that I happen to have in the frig.  We were saying pretty much what everyone else was saying bland tasting.   This needs something.  I would make it again with the addition of the sauce I added at the dinner table after several bites thinking hmmm soy sauce? Since we are cutting down on salt went for Teriyaki since it was 50 percent less salt.  Hope this helps someone salvage a dish that needed a bit of a push from bland to yummy.",
