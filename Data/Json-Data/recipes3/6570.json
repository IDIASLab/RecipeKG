Also, mine was not as colorful as the picture...very white / light colored....not sure how to get such rich colors.  In looking at other paella recipes, I may choose to add some tomatoes to this next time around to brighten it up.  Overall a thumbs up....My son said, I can make this again.....",

It tastes as good as those packaged yellow rice mixes but no artificial ingredients! I did not use any seafood. I used a cut up whole chicken. I browned all the pieces set them aside and proceeded with the recipe. I also used chicken sausage cut into rounds (also cooked them in the pan before adding the rice and liquid) and some cooked pancetta. I used brown rice and I did reduce the liquid to about 4.5 cups total to take into consideration the juices that would come from the chicken. It needs to cook much longer with brown rice. I think about an hour and half. I am using a large enameled cast iron dutch oven to cook everything. It is really delicious. I've added a generous amount of sea salt since I seasoned all the chicken with salt and pepper and added at least 1/2 tsp to the \"liquid seasoning\" part of the recipe.",
