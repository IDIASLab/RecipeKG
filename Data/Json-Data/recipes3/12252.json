This recipe is super easy and you can add other ingredients as you like! I substituted lean ground turkey for beef, added some chopped mushrooms, and for variety red, purple, and green diced bell peppers! Yummy and very filling! Thx for this easy delicious healthy meal!",

Squash absolutely makes this dish. The ground beef only compliments it, with the seasonings. This is not just healthy, but hearty! It is a great full meal in itself. I make this constantly in my dinner rotation! Probably one of my favorites. If you need a little kick- add some diced jalape\u00f1o. If you want a more rich dish: add in some sour cream or cream cheese prior to baking. This one is so easily versatile, but seriously doesn\u2019t need editing!",
