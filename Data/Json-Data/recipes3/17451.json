                "reviewBody": "Alright I got daring and changed things up a bit. Others commented on how they like red sauce on their pizza so I thought I would give it a try. Well it was great! I used Hunt's Garlic and Herb Spaghetti Sauce. I changed a few other things a little too. I made my own pizza dough using my bread machine but the refrigerated pizza dough works fine too. I like to put the dough on my pizza stone and make breadsticks with the excess dough but have also used a rectangular pan if I need more pizza. I then spread the herb butter over the dough. As per other reviews I also added another 1/2 teaspoon dried basil 1 tablespoon butter and another garlic clove. This mixture barely covered the dough. After the thin layer of the herb butter mixture I spooned on a layer of the Hunt's sauce. I then sprinkled some parmesan cheese and even some mozarella cheese (which I recommend) over it. I then added some chicken strips (Tyson's Fajita Chicken Strips because I was in a time crunch - it was fantastic and I have used it every time since!) and also added three Roma tomatoes instead of two. I found that chopping the tomatoes instead of slicing made them easier to eat on the pizza. I topped it with a sprinkle of cilantro. I'm a cilantro fan but I agree with others it was overpowering. I didn't even put in 1/4 cup. So the next time I made this I put in even less. I would not omit it all together - it does add to the flavor. This pizza was so good! My husband absolutely LOVES it!!!",

I have to admit I didn't have all the ingredients specified so used leftover roasted chicken feta instead of ricotta and regular tomatoes instead of roma. I also made my own crust. But this was an excellent recipe for the ideas and as with most pizza recipes it was pretty much adaptable for what was on hand in the kitchen and what we like. Thanks for the ideas!",

I made my own whole-wheat pizza crust and grilled the chicken with cumin paprika chilli powder onion powder and garlic and black pepper salt to give it more flavor. I used more garlic than required (since I love garlic!) and even added garlic powder into the butter (I used light margerine) mixture. It turned out fabulous. I also sprinkled on dried oregano and italian seasoning to give it a more herbie taste. You would like to add fresh sliced white mushrooms too! My husband and I love this pizza and I would definitely keep this recipe as long as I live! Thank you so much for this worthy recipe!!!",

Thanks for an awesome recipe that I will make often.\n\nUpdate:  This has become a regular in our household.  Don't listen to reviews that say to add red sauce.  The pesto-like basil-green onion sauce is one of the best things about this pizza.  It also takes great on a homemade wheat crust.  YUM!  This is AWESOME. ",
