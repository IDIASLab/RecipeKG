If you can find flavored macaroni, such as garlic or roasted pepper, it will inhance the flavor.  Also, the parmesan truly inhances the flavor, and is not to be left out!  Enjoy!",

My husband wanted twice the noodles so against my better judgement I added 1 c and as I suspected the soup ended up pretty thick by the time the noodles were done - it's kind of like a chowder now!  Also, the noodles are a bit overcooked and gluey.  Next time I'll cook the noodles separately and add them to the soup so the soup maintains more of its liquid.  Will definitely make this again. UPDATE:  I froze about a quart of this for about 6 mos and it held up great and still tasted good!",

Instead of using regular chicken broth, I first roasted the Christmas day turkey bones, then boiled them in water for an hour with a couple of carrots, an onion, a few bay leaves and some pepper corns, to make a rich delicious broth. I also added some left-over turkey meat, and used a can of kidney beans. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter. The result was amazing - a rich, tasty hearty soup, just perfect for a Winter day. I will definitely be making this again! (3.17.06 This recipe has gradually evolved into an 'Everything but the kitchen sink' kind of soup - it's great for using up all those sad-looking veggies that take up fridge space, those 90% empty boxes of pasta in the cupboard, and the half can of whatever beans you didn't use. It doesn't matter what you use, it always tastes great!)",

                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe and admittedly tweaked it quite a lot.  However, I do think I came up with something very similar to the submitter\u2019s version.  I used olive oil instead of margarine and only one T. not four.  I increased the celery to a generous 1/2 cup and bumped the carrots up to about 3/4 cup.  I thought the amount of cabbage was negligible, and I didn\u2019t have it anyway, so I left that out.  I used diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil, and instead of potatoes, I used a combination of zucchini and yellow squash.  Lastly I subbed ditalini pasta for the elbows.  As for the process, I tweaked that a bit as well.  I saut\u00e9ed the onion, celery and carrots for about 5 minutes, adding the garlic during the final 30 seconds.  I then added the other ingredients, except for the beans and pasta.  I gently simmered for 30 minutes, which was probably a bit too long.  I would cut that back to 10-15 minutes next time, so the zucchini won\u2019t be overcooked.  I cooked my pasta separately and added it along with the beans and some fresh basil and just heated it through.  Garnished with fresh parsley.  My result was a delicious, veggie-packed soup that was low in fat and calories, but very satisfying!!  We loved it!!  UPDATE 3/26/13: I made this again as before but this time threw in some coarsely chopped fresh spinach at the very end, which was a very nice addition.",
