And I find it a waste of time to pull down the chicken so I just leave it like normal wings.",

Recipe states to marinate the wings and then remove the wings from marinade and add the cornstarch to marinade to make a batter to dip the wings in. Problem is there is hardly enough liquid to marinate the wings in much less have any to make a batter. He ended up just rubbing the mixture on the 10 drumettes let sit 30 minutes (didn't push meat down) and grilling them. Excellent flavor but gave this recipe only one star for the obvious flaw.",

I came across this recipe and decided to make for my wife and son. However I borrowed few steps from another recipe and replaced green chillies with black pepper. I also decided not to put artificial color as I feel it is unhealthy. Lastly I changed the last step before frying. I chose to dip marinated chicken in egg and all-purpose flour batter and then apply bread crumbs before frying. The result was fantastic and both my wife and son loved it. They asked me to make it again the next day and this time I bought 1kg lolipops:) I would highly recommend with above twist in the recipe.",
