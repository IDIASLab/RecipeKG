I did not cook the prosciutto because we love the flavor it already has. Might as well use (much cheaper) bacon if you're going to fry it up. It was great with the prosciutto as is. In the future I'd up the grapes and decrease the peas a little as there were a bunch left over at the end. Thanks for a keeper!",
