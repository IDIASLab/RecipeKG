I rinsed and drained the black beans (instead of kidney beans) and fried them with the onion, green pepper, lots of cumin and chili pepper, and garlic. Then I combined the bean mixture with the flour, about 1/4 cup of sala, more chili pepper, 1/4 cup of cilantro (this really made it), and 1/2 a cup of rolled oats instead of breadcrumbs (so much healthier!). They formed perfectly into burgers and I coated them with hot sauces and I baked them for 15 minutes. Delicious!\n\nEdit: I made this again the same as above, but this time I combined oats AND cooked brown rice until the consistency was right. I think it was even better!",

Finally found it!  (Happy dance!)  I did make a few modifications - based on others recommendations and my personal taste.  First - I used black beans (which I drained and rinsed really well.)  Then I chopped the carrots and sauteed them w/ the chopped onions, garlic and some cumin - and I replaced the bell pepper w/ chopped green chili.  And threw in a few squirts of Tabasco Chipotle sauce.  I also suggest starting w/ 1/2 cup of salsa at the end and building from there to the right consistency.  Sear the burgers and then drop the temp in the pan and cook slowly to cook all the way through.  The flavor is fantastic and my husband and I loved it.  7 year old stepdaughter liked it \"a whole lot.\"  We followed the recommended serving suggestions and really enjoyed dinner tonight!  Thanks Valerie!",

I also took another reviewer's advice and coated the patties in cornmeal before frying - that was an excellent tip. The serving suggestion of lettuce avocado and sour cream was also great. The only reason I'm giving this recipe four stars instead of five is that I found it a little bit difficult. The patties didn't hold together very well until I added some egg to the mixture. I will definitely make it again though. Update: I am changing my rating to five stars because I have been making this recipe regularly and with a little bit of practice it is really not difficult at all. In fact it has become a household favourite!",
