I recommend coating in egg and bread crumbs spritz with oil and bake the rounds instead. This is what I usually do with eggplant and should have done it this time. Also the olive oil/anchovy sauce would probably be better with a bit less olive oil. My whole dish just turned out to be too oily and looked nothing like the pictures loaded here.",

This will prevent that odd eggplant flavour as well as allow the slices to fry up crispier. 2) skip the sauce at the end. instead toss a whole clove of garlic into the oil as you fry the eggplant to get the garlic flavour and add one leaf of fresh basil per stack. to make it easier to eat I suggest peeling the eggplant even just in strips so that its easier to cut.",
