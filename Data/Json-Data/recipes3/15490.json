        "description": "Generally, if the need for poutine is strong, you'd stock up on fresh cheese curds at the store. But since many of my viewers don't live near such stores, I decided to take one for the team and show you how to make your own. Is it worth all the effort? Well, fried cheese curds are a very nice treat, and having a cube of fresh cheese to pop into your mouth any time you get the urge is pretty sweet. And, of course, your poutine will thank you. You can serve these immediately or cover with a cheesecloth and let sit for 12 hours for a tangier flavor.",
