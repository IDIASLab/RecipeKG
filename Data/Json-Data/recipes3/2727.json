I prepared it by browning the chicken then added the onions and lots of garlic cooked it until the onions were soft then added the brocolli and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. (The chicken broth helps take away the natural bitterness of the brocolli). I then added a 24 oz. can of crushed tomatoes basil oregano parmesan cheese and a cup of dry red wine. I then let it simmer for 30 minutes and tossed with rigatoni. Turned out very well and I would definitely make it again!",

The sauce noodles and chicken all slide around together but never create a \"dish\". Healthy doesn't have to mean taste-free. I would make a pesto from almonds (Or purchased lol) and add that right after cooking but while hot. You don't need to add a ton like a sauce just enough to boost flavor and make the ingredients \"marry\". You'd be boosting the protein adding a \"good\" fat and better nutrients as well. Secondly I would add grated carrots to the mix. The carrots will add a pleasant sweet to compliment the savory. Carrots also help to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. It's a good basic foundation it just needs some personality. Don't give up on it yet:)",
