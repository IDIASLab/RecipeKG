I have two tips regarding the cucumber/yogurt sauce, and these are: 1. Spoon the yogurt into a coffe filter, and put it somewhere so that the fluid can drain from the yogurt. This result in a firmer, creamier yogurt. 2. Use English/Hothouse cucumbers instead of the regular waxy cukes. Strip the skin off with a vegetable peeler, and then grate the flesh into the yogurt with a cheesegrater.",
