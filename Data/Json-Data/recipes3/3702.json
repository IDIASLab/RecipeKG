I love that you don't have to peel the potatoes.  This saves alot of time if you're preparing for a larger crowd.  I would suggest salting the potatoes before boiling and increasing the salt/pepper seasoning X 2.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  This will be a staple in my collection.

We're not fond of vinegar in our potato salad, and the additional garlic flavor makes the dish! I've also made this dish using regular potatoes - peeled, and finely chopped yellow onions in place of green onions. It's very good! I usually top with a sprinkling of paprika, parsley flakes and halved, hard-boiled eggs for presentation. Everyone asks for the recipe!\r\n",

I reduced mayo by 1/2.  I added more green onions.  I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 teaspoon of celery seed and 1/4 teaspoon dill.              Also, needed more salt than recipe stated.  Per all recipes' cooking potatoes tips, my potatoes were the perfect texture.  I left the skins on cut them into bite-size chunks.  Place them in a pot and cover them with water.  Bring to a boil and salt the water.  Keep the pot at a gentle boil and cook for approx. 8-15 minutes until tender and drain.  Cool potatoes by spreading them on a baking sheet in a single layer.  I never liked making potatoe salad because I'd either have hard or mushy potatoes.  If you follow the cooking steps, I think you'll have perfectly cooked potatoes.",

I took some suggestions from the Summer Potato Salad recipe on this site: I replaced the vinegar in this recipe with lemon juice, and the salt with seasoned salt. To cut down on the mayo I used 1/3 plain yogurt instead. I don't think the yogurt made a difference in the taste. But I thought it needed more flavor when I tried it so I did add a few tablespoons of dijon mustard, a lot of fresh parsley, and some salt. It turned out well.",
