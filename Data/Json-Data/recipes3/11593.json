I used grape tomatoes and added only 1/2 the bagel chips in with the other ingredients and dressing, and the other 1/2 right before serving to keep some crunch in there. I could not bring myself to add a full tablespoon of dried basil in the dressing (I'm not a super huge fan of dried basil), so I did reduce that to only about 1/4 teaspoon, and that was perfect for us. This really did taste just like bruschetta! I will def be making this often over the summer~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I recommend whisking the dressing ingredients separately (olive oil, vinegar, minced garlic, dried basil, salt & pepper) and then mixing the dressing into the tomatoes, etc.  Chill at least 2 hours!   Don't be deterred by the addition of dried basil -- it serves a purpose of being a concentrated taste as well as making pretty little specks on the mozzarella cubes.   This is definitely one of my new contributions to any \"potluck\"!",

First of all, with so few ingredients, those ingredients need to be best quality, and/or fresh!  I'm making it again tonight, and I'm using home-grown Roma tomatoes & fresh Basil.  Did you know that the more you cut from your basil plant the better it grows!!!  Two, nix the Red-wine vinegar, & use Basalmic vinegar (the best grade you can find, 5 medallions or better.  AND, use that bottle ONLY for this type of fresh presentation!).  The last change I will make is a personal choice only, & that's because I really disliked the bagel chips.  So, I'm making bread cubes using Chef John's method (see Chef John's Panzanella Salad for the technique to make bread cubes that don't get soggy!).  So that's it, for me.  Thanks Steph, for sharing a great salad, and Blessings!!!",

I took the ingredients up to the lake and when I got ready to put the salad together I realized I had bought garlic pita chips rather than bagel chips.  They still worked great in the salad.  I mixed up the salad about 30 minutes before dinner and added the chips about 15 minutes before dinner time. We have fresh tomatoes and basil growing in our garden, so I know this fantastic salad will be made numerous times over this summer. Thank you Steph Barber, for sharing your recipe.",
