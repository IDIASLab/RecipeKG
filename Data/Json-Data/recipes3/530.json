I cut it in strips and marinated it in a big storage bag with liquid zesty Italian dressing for a few hrs. I didn't use mushrooms because my family hates them. I used extra onions and peppers because I had more than 2 cups of meat. The liquid marinade cooked down nicely and when I added the dry dressing mix it just made the flavor POP. Everbody chowed down on these and I will definately make them again. We also had spanish rice and fat free refried beans.",
