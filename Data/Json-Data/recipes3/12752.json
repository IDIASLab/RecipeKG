        "description": "My boyfriend and I eat dairy-free; he has no choice in the matter because of a severe casein allergy. This creamy cheese sauce is not only dairy-free, but extremely yummy and a great base recipe. You can do just about anything with it! Add a dash of cumin for that smoky Cheddar taste for mac and cheese, add more garlic, butter, and parsley for Alfredo, or add a can of tomatoes and green chiles to make that staple queso dip! It bakes well, too. Try chicken spaghetti with this creamy cheese sauce!",
