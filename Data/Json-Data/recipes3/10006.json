I used coconut oil as my vegetable oil, added bell peppers and used some minced jar garlic when cooking the vegetables. Seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and seasoned salt when cooking. Otherwise used this wonderful recipe as stated. We aren't on the \"cream\" will kill you bandwagon, but cheap vegetable oils might :) Such a versatile recipe, you could choose your meat, veggie or pasta into many variations, change up some herbs. If I could give it a 10 I would. Of course cream tastes good on a bumper. Thank You!",
