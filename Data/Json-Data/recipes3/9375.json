Made recipe as written with tomatoes onions and zucchini fresh from the garden. Used some extra tomatoes since I was adding pasta. Added cooked tortellini at the very end and simmered for a few minutes...also added a touch of balsamic vinaigrette as fresh tomatoes just screamed for it. Was amazing...will definitely use again as written as a side...thanks for the inspiration.",

I just have one question before trying it - The recipe says to cook it until the cheese melts - but the photo clearly shows balls of mozzarella cheese. In fact it looks like a classic cold caprese salad - with zucchini and pasta added. Did you cook and stir yours until the cheese melted and serve it as a hot sauce on pasta? Or did you serve it cold on cold pasta salad? Frankly that last option sounds real good to me!",
