I saut\u00e9ed onions and mushrooms in the butter then added a stalk of celery with the leaves and a 4 oz can of chopped green chiles (I know it isn't for Marsala but it was good). In a bowl I mixed 2 cans of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup light cream 3/4 cup dry sherry (I didn't have Marsala on hand) and 3/4 cup vegetable stock and a half cup of shredded Mexican cheese. Then mixed sauce with saut\u00e9ed veggies and chicken and baked in 350 degree oven for 1 hour (no foil). Served over noodles! Yummy!",
