In this recipe they are as moist as meat can be. The sauce is so flavorful. The basil makes this dish (I substituted about 2 tsp dry basil). The recipe was simple to make. You could probably throw in an extra chop or two since it makes ample sauce. I wouldn't suggest making any other substitutions, as this recipe is perfect as-is (except, I'm sure it would also be great with chicken).",
