To this day, (twenty years later), it remains one of my favourites. Don't be frightened by this seemingly strange combination of ingredients; this is brilliant! The nice thing about this recipe is that it doesn't require any measurements. You use an equal amount of each ingredient, so it's infinitely scalable!",

Nothing needed to be changed - I made minor ones - used Goya seasoning to season the meat before cooking and again at the end in place of the salt and pepper. I also had some leftover canned corn which I added. I cut the meat into bite sized pieces therefore 20 min. of cooking time was plenty - it would have been dried out if I had done 30 min. I served it over rice but the next time I'n going to serve it by itself (it is filling) and put out some crusty bread with butter. Thanks submitter.",
