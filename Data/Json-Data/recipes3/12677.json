Also, we added mushrooms which were a wonderful addition. (I forgot my peas and didn\u2019t remember them until AFTER I had already puff pastried it. But that\u2019s was okay and think next time I\u2019ll add some fresh green beans in instead.) Did not foil my puff pastry but it also didn\u2019t rise as much as I thought it would. And I didn\u2019t peel my gold potatoes, it wasn\u2019t necessary. Cooking time was off and had to cook an additional 15 minutes.\n\nLeftovers were more delicious than the 1st night we ate it.",
