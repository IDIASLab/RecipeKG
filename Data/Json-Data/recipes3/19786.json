I use more cheese than is called for and slightly less mayo (just enough to keep the mixture moist). I also use less dill and sprinkle basil over the top before baking. I would suggest steaming the broccoli to \"crisp tender\" and lightly frying the onion and garlic. Otherwise the vegetables do not cook through during baking and the onion especially can be a bit strong. All in all this is a fantastic recipe that lends itself to variety and is easy to prepare.",

I made a boo-boo tho and didn't form the braid on the pan so I kinda screwed it up as I had to transfer it to the pan and it got a bit messed up in the process. I substitued some of the ingredients to what I had on hand. I used green pepper instead of red Italian seasoning instead of dill weed and mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. Everything else I kept the same including the almonds (which I couldnt seem taste by the way). I thought it was great & so did my hubby. I will be making this again! I knew how to make the braid from a previous recipe long ago so I thought I would draw a diagram (forgive my paintshop skills!) for those of you having problems.

I also like to use PIZZA DOUGH instead of the rolls - those just never seemed appealing to me. I cook the chicken in a pan on the stove with a little extra virgin olive oil the broccoli the garlic and the onion. I always add celery and carrot to this dish and sometimes some green onion. I also sprinkle sesame seeds on top before baking it. This is an easy recipe that always yields excellent results.",

A few changes that I do: steam broccoli before I like to season and boil my chicken to cook it although we have grilled it before and it comes out just as yummy use 1 red bell pepper and 1 green bell pepper omit the onion and we usually use the whole package of sliced/slivered almonds (they give the dish the best crunch)!! Definitely my favorite recipe of all times! Update: My husband and I make this at least once a month! We ALWAYS have trouble cooking this (the top/middle of the crescent rolls never get done as quickly as the sides do)...so we use some foil to cover the sides so that everything cooks evenly...it usually takes close to an hour (covered and uncovered to cook completely. We have tried cooking on a baking stone and also a cookie sheet...either works just fine. We use 1/2 teaspoon of dill and sharp cheddar cheese. Love this!",
