                "reviewBody": "SO...I bought 2 packages of ground chicken only to discover that one of them was turkey! But I got to do a side-by-side comparison of the two! For us: not a major difference. The chicken was \"goopier\" to work with - the ground turkey was easier to make into meatballs. (FYI: I drained the water from the spinach - didn't squeeze it out just poured it out). Flavor was almost identical and even the texture wasn't much different. As for the flavor - these were GREAT! The first bite was a little heavy on the spinach but after a few more they grew on me! All 4 teenagers in my house and my hubby liked them... although the one spinach-hater wasn't overly thrilled with all the green but ate them anyways and liked them. We had them plain (no sauce just rice and veggies) but these would be great in any way - sweet and sour or in a spaghetti sauce. Thanks for the great recipe Radhika - will make these again!",

I thought the flavor was good but the ginger was a little bit too strong for me. I also wasn't crazy about the texture of the meatball. Without having a binder in the recipe and using the lean ground chicken the texture was a little\"spongey\"for me but my husband liked them as is. We were a house divided in our opinions so I say give them a try!",

                "reviewBody": "I had to substitute turnip and mustard greens for the spinach because I m on no-oxalates but the lower score would not be fixed by using spinach. There are no problems with the recipe although I did add some baking time... about 5 minutes hoping they would brown up. They stay pale and the greens are very green so I would avoid serving to company unless you know they won t be thrown. I would suggest chopping the greens very fine or you get clumps of them in the meatballs. As far as the taste goes the ginger-jalapeno-basil-tumeric-asiago-feta combination is probably going to be a new one for people. The first meatball invoked blandness but for me it got better as I ate. There s a weird heat that happens in the back of your mouth after a few bites and it helps with the flavor of your future bites. I thought they were totally edible after 3 meatballs my friend disagreed.",
