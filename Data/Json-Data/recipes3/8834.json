                "reviewBody": "Didn't meet my family's or my expectations. I know it's a veggie burger but it was a little too different in both taste and texture. To help the texture I recommend finely chopping the mushrooms and olives separately and then mixing them into the other items that have been blended/processed. Adding an egg should help everything stick together. Then for the taste when working with plantains ripeness is a concern as their taste changes a lot the riper they get. In my personal experience the greener plantains will add something similar to a pickle taste which could work for a burger if you like pickles. I don't know how to give it a meatier taste.",
