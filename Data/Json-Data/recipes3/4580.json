As I was making it, I was starting to doubt the recipe as there aren't many ingredients and I wondered if the pizza would be bland without sauce. Once I took my first bite, I knew it'd become a staple in my house! I love BLTs and this was excellent, tastes just like one. My advice is to sprinkle the lettuce on each individual piece as you serve it. That way if there are any leftovers, you won't get soggy bread/wilted lettuce. Chop fresh lettuce each time.. it's worth it!",

Doubled up on the bacon, tomatoes, and mayo. When I went to make the dressing, I whisked together the mayo, 1/2 tsp. of garlic salt, and 1/4 tsp. of pepper with a little bit of water to make it easier to coat the lettuce. Pleased all of the adults and 2 out of 3 kids. This is gonna be a new family favorite! Thanks AMYAME!",

I prepared as directed, except I'm lazy and hate my house smelling like fried bacon, so I used Hormel real bacon pieces instead of \"real\" bacon.  I used part skim cheese and light mayo and it still tasted great. To further lighten the recipe, I will also use a stronger cheese, maybe a sharp blend like classic melts, but use less of it.  My husband enjoyed it, too.  This will be a cheap, easy weeknight keeper!  THANKS!",
