First time I made it I mixed it all at night and ate the next day but the avocado will start to brown so the next time I made it I mixed the chicken with the bacon ranch dressing added dill and brought a container of cashews and a half avocado (add lime on it and it wont brown). When Im ready for lunch I add the cashews and avocado mix and its perfect!! great meal. Lower in carbs high in proteins",
