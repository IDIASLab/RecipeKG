I used a Savoy cabbage and cut it into bite-sized pieces. The pork turned out surprisingly moist and even though I didn't think I'd like the cabbage... my husband and I both enjoyed it. It did burn on the bottom but we both kind of liked the darker done cabbage. Next time I think I'll take the pork out at the end of the cook time (after cooking at a little lower temp to prevent burning) and then saute the cabbage just a little bit longer to get more caramelization on it.",
