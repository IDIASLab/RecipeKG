I got this recipe from a close friend which included the craisins. Also per her suggestion I \"melted\" the vinagar with 3Tblsp. sugar in the microwave before adding the mayo. Makes for a smoother dressing. I promise those little cranberries make the difference. I now omit the raisins all together. Try it. It's great!",

For the dressing I used half sour cream instead of the full mayo and cut back the vinegar to 1/4 c. as I wanted a thicker dressing. I also added garlic powder and basil. I also threw in a good sized handful of fresh parmesan cheese in with the dressing too for extra zip. I took a taste. Really good. I bet it would be even better after sitting for a while. EDITED TO ADD: This was so good. Both my husband and I ate seconds of this. There were no leftovers! I'll make this again for sure!",

I followed another poster's advice and blanched the broccoli for 3 minutes followed by an ice bath to soften it and brighten its color. I also used basalmic vinegar and a little sugar craisins and some shredded cheddar and red onion. I give it only 3 stars because I changed it so much I feel it's a whole different recipe. But hubby ate it (kids wouldn't touch it no suprise there) so I will be making this again and again.",

The I remove it from the hot water and plunge it into a pot of iced cold water until broc is cold and then drain it well. This makes the broc a nice bright green mellows the bitterness and is still crunchy. 2.) I use rice vinegar - nice and mellow but still vinegery. once for a party -- I was out of rice vinegar so I used about a tsp /- of sugar in the vinegar & mayo and stirred it until the sugar was disolved. Then to the salad I added half a can of drained shoe peg corn (thin white corn) and I got a lot of raves on it from guests! I never use the raisins because we do not like them.",
