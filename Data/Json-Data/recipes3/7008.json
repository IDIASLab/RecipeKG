Since it is winter and fresh tomatoes are virtually flavorless I used two 14.5 oz cans of diced garlic flavored tomatoes drained instead. I also used herbed feta for the topping because that's what I had in the fridge. I didn't add any extra salt since the olives capers and cheese are already high in sodium. I also cooked an extra cup of rigatoni and the recipe served three adults as a main course. My \"purist\" Italian husband had a philosophical issue with using feta instead of a traditional Italian cheese but it is excellent as written and I will definitely make it again.",

I was using up some artichokes though so thought I'd try it on him and see. He ate it but wasn't overly thrilled. That's okay; I LOVE the flavor and I'll eat this for lunch leftovers. I doubled the recipe and got five servings of this. I also used canned tomatoes (2 cans) instead of fresh and added more olives (whole so I could pick them out for hubs). I did think the feta was good but maybe a tad overkill; there's so many strong flavors in here that Parmesan or mozzarella might work even better. You need to like all of these ingredients separately in order to like them in this dish. Thanks for the recipe!",
