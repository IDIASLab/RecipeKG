I made three batches and used about 12 oz. mushrooms total. The heavy cream/egg yolk mixture makes the recipie. Smell the mixture prior to adding it -- and then after adding it. So rich so good. I actually used more scallops than called for and I also added about 1/3 lb. of medium-small shrimp per batch... I intentionally broke the scallops up a bit with a whisk while cooking (I used large scallops) to make it more evenly distributed. All in all excellent flavor. One reviewer had said they'd used 5 potatoes vs. 3... I used three. I think 5 would have made it a little too thick for my taste. This will definitely become a regular in my book. Regards.",

Everyone who loves seafood just wolfs it down. Even those who are not wild about seafood and mushrooms have admitted its delicious. I often add extra scallops and / or mushrooms and it always turns out great. I intend to try it with shrimp and maybe lobster. I serve with crust fench bread for dipping. The hardest part is the chopping (tedious and time consuming because you want the veggies sliced up as small as possible) and the pureeing because I always do it when the veggies are warm and it gets hot and the mixture is thick but its not really a complicated recipe just time consuming for a novice cook such as myself.",
