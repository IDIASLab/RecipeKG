Maybe a little complicated with the multiple veggies and cheese that needed to be chopped but nothing too bad just prep everything first and don't try and put it together as your go. I decided not fry them as listed in the recipe and instead baked them. These are the changes I made to the cooking instructions: I preheated the oven to 375 degrees prepared the stuffing as listed above there was no mention of whether the juice from the crawfish should be added as well as the meat but I chose not to since I didn't want them to make the bread soggy I hollowed out the pistolettes and was careful to keep the tip of the roll with the hollowed out portion it came from so I could reattach it. I made a slurry of 1 tbs flour and 3 tbs of water and mixed it up thouroughly and brushed on the open end of the pistolette and then dipped only the inside of the cut end of the bread in the slurry and pressed the ends together. I stood them on the non-cut end until time for baking just to make sure they were firmly attached I laid them down and brushed with melted butter. I baked on a well-greased cookie sheet for 15 minutes or until golden brown. I only made enough for us to eat for dinner and then the next day I made the rest for us to eat at lunch so nothing was soggy. I thought they were great and I would definitely make again!",
