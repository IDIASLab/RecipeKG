I really liked the concept of this recipe but I think this recipe is more of a base and needs some bumped up flavors added hence the 3 stars. But as a base recipe it can easily have added ingredients to fit your tastes to make it a 4 or 5 star. I added dashes of hot sauce dijon mustard sugar onion and garlic powders cayenne and some sweet paprika. It's also great along with garnishing with green onion on top to add some bacon and cheddar cheese! Thanks for this great idea! I will make again when wanting a lightened up version of deviled eggs.",
