I thought that I had drown the brisket, as some of the other's did, the pot size is very important in proportion to the size of the piece of brisket, but as the recipe directed, \u2018after removing the Brisket from the pot\u2019, I simmered the broth with the Pot Lid ajar, until it reduced (about 1hr) to a fine delectably tasty gravy.  Yes this recipe will be well used and some of the hints in the other reviews as well, But, let us not forget this was and is the only recipe that I found that met my requirements for a Delicious mouth-watering Brisket of Beef sandwich.  My Gratitude and Appreciation to you FriendlyFood for submitting and sharing your Mothers Recipe.  Note: This was the first time since my Mother passed that I used her old seasoned & blackened (Dutch oven), I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called?  Anyway it brought back many fond memories of her in the kitchen cooking her favorite recipes such as pot roast or turkey & giblet gravy.  Thanks & Regards\n\nRECIPE NOTES:\n \u2022  Be careful with the pepper (Don't over season, you can't change after it is cooked and too much pepper will make the Brisket inedible. If your not sure(try dusting off excess pepper before cooking)\n\n\u2022  Be sure to N",

I have used a similar recipe like this for years the only differences are: I brown the roast completely before adding the onions and as I allergic to garlic I leave that out. The size of the pan determines how much the liquid will reduce. If you roast in a dutch oven there will not be much reduction so use less water. When I make it I fill only half up the roast. If you use a more shallow pan fill to cover the roast. Delicious!",

The other turned out like jerky (my fault I think the recipe has great potential) so I was happy to have this as backup. I had a few issues with the actual execution of the recipe. I couldn't figure out how the uncooked side of the meat would brown on top of onions so I browned it before adding the onions. Because the onions were thickly sliced adding the liquid to nearly cover the meat results in swimming meat when the onions cook down and a LOT of liquid left at the end. I used beef broth (1 can regular 1 can Campbell's double strength). I made gravy and the flavor was good but pretty salty so I'll adjust the broth content next time. The meat was wet but not moist (if that makes sense). I've never made brisket before so that may just be the nature of the beast. The simple ingredients really allowed the meat flavor to take center stage and meat purists will appreciate the taste.",

Then I transferred it for the remaining 2 hours to the oven covered at 260 F. I found that this made a thicker richer liquor. At the end of 4 hours we ate (it was terrific) and I left it in the oven for another 3 hours on 200 F and it was even better. I bet by tomorrow it will be so tender that it will melt in the mouth.
