I started the recipe as written and after 20 minutes of boiling I moved it to a cutting board to cool. I came back in 5 minutes to find my counter drawers and floor covered in blood. I started another pot of water and this time let the tongue boil for over an hour. No blood this time but still so tough that the skin wouldn't even budge. I wish I could tell you exactly how long this needed to boil but after my 2nd failed attempt I stuck it in the fridge and resorted to plan B. The next morning I threw it in a slow cooker and let it cook on low 8 hours and it was perfect. I then proceeded with the remaining steps of the recipe and it turned out good. I am no stranger to beef tongue but I have cooked them in a slow cooker in the past and that has always worked for me. I recommend planning at least an hour a pound if you are going to boil and go from there. This recipe has great potential but as written it did not work for me. Sorry.",
