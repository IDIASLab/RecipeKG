Ukrainian katleti are very similar but I must admit a little boring compared to the chimichurri. Don't be afraid to try this for your Eastern European family, they will absolutely love it. Before you know it, you won't be making katleti anyone, all chimichurri for our household! Enjoy and don't be afraid to let me know your outcome.",

I did have a little trouble getting the burgers to stay together in the skillet but other than that no complaints. If I make these again I would grill them instead and I would also use red onion petals for more color.",
