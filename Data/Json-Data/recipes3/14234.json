I used red whole grain rice which gave it a nutty flavor that white rice can t give. Using a spiralizer to cut the carrot and cucumber reduced cooking time. I wasn t too fond of the taste of cucumber with this and will use zucchini next time instead. I also added fresh cayenne peppers to spice it up. Thank you for the recipe.",
