                "reviewBody": "This was very tasty.  It was much milder/blander than I expected with the given seasonings.  I accidentally undersalted since I had seasoned the ground beef but forgot to add more seasoning after adding the potatoes.  It was slightly dry--I might moisten with a little broth next time.  I used one small Yukon and one small sweet potato.  I wonder about adding chopped spinach or peas or shredded carrots next time.  Definitely worth trying again; I've never had this before but seems like it could be a good comfort food and is easy to make.  I used too many sheets of phyllo so it wouldn't easily bend so I left it in long tubular rolls.  I notice a 16 oz. box of phyllo contains 40 sheets (5 sheets per serving), so next time I would use that as a guide.  I was confused and didn't intially realize that this should create 8 individual rolls, and perhaps only uses half of a 16 oz. pkg. of phyllo if only using 2 sheets per roll.  I would think they could be shaped into a round spiral easier with fewer sheets of phyllo.  I ended up with five long rolls.  Definitely worth trying again.  Kids and hubbie all ate and liked.  We only ate about half of this so I would think it could easily serve 6 with a side dish.  Thanks for sharing your recipe--I love trying new food combinations and the allspice really intrigued me.  I might even add a little more allspice next time.  And maybe minced apple.  Hopefully fruit or other veggie additions would not completely destroy any ethnic authenticity.",

I think moisture is also the key to working with phyllo dough so here are a few ideas. \n1) Don't drain the beef too much - or at all! The grease helps to make the dough sheets pliable. 2) When you are not using the dough sheets cover them directly with a damp kitchen rag so they don't crack when you roll them up. 3) If the dough still isn't moist enough to work with you'll have to keep lathering on the butter as you roll it. Also I threw an egg in the beef mixture, which seemed to help.  \n\nA little more grease may not make it healthier but it definitely makes it more delicious and more authentic!",

I actually make my own phyllo dough as do most bosnians so when we use thr roll technique the dough is more water based. Buy you can always stack eith the store bought phyllo. My father loves it this way and since it does take a long time to dry your own homemade phyllo I just used the store phyllo and stack with layers. Also I dont use allspice, I guess i make it a little past the original by adding cumin to the recipe it really gives it a deeper taste. And I love the natural yoghurt but for those unable to get it you can always use butter milk and dip it in the buttermilk or even sour cream and just dip it like that. Also with this you can feel free to expirament with different fillings I love cheese filling, I just take some cottage cheese one egg and a little salt, some add spinach its very good.",

I decided to try my hand at making this because of the reviews and the fact that I've never made Bosnian food before. The meat turned out great but was dry. It needs a sauce to cover it or dip it in. One of the reviewers said that it was difficult to roll into spin wheels with more than 2 sheets. I can tell you with only using 2 and even trying 1 that rolling into spin wheels with packaged phyllo isn't possible. I tried with 2 and then with 1 and it just wouldn't work. My rolls ended up breaking. I think a softer wetter dough is necessary to make them into spin wheels.",
