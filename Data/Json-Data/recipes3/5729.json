If you are on a quest for \"authentic\" borscht like it is the holy grail, good luck - there are many interpretations.  I tried this one because I am not pigeonholed into one type.  An open mind will yield many good things.  This was an EXCELLENT dish.  Very clean, very delicious.  It has that ethnic taste you are looking for when you want borscht.  Who cares what it's called?

Remember the main thing: there is not the one authentic borscht recipe, every single family make this dish on its own way. There are thousand variations and interpretations of this dish. We have the main ingredients - beets, cabbage (not exactly red, you can easily use a regular white cabbage), potatoes, carrots and onions. And then use your imagination. Some people make borscht using pork or beef, some add mushrooms, I`ve heard of even adding prunes. As to this recipe I would change the proportions a little just for my taste. I would use 1 1/2 cups beets, only one large onion and less tomato puree (tomatoes are optional but the borscht will be tastier). Don`t substitute cumin for caraway seeds. Cumin has an oriental flavor that can ruin Russian flavor in borscht. If you don`t have caraway seeds just omit them, they are optional. And definitely serve the borscht with sour cream, very traditional. The borscht consistency ends on your personal preference, if you prefer thick, add less water or more vegetables, if you prefer watery, add more water. So if you want to try Russian borscht, this is a great recipe to start.",
