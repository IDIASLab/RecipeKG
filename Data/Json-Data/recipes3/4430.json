One of my clients used it as a Holiday Dip for her party and it ran out in the first 30 minutes of the party!!! Hats Off To You for a Job Well Done!!",

Unsure of the spicy-index of the crowd, I cut the salt, cayenne and Cajun seasoning in half. I increased the crab to 1 1/2 pounds, as well as the eggs to 3. Didn't seem to ruin the dish at all. Next time I'm making this for my family, I will go back to your original recipe. We like it spicey!",

Also added 1/2 t old bay seasoning and 1/2 t garlic pepper. Instead of American Cheese used a bag of mixed cheeses because that is what I had on hand. And believe it or not this tastes even better the 2nd day! Thanks for the great recipe Dennis. It will become a staple for our parties for sure.",
