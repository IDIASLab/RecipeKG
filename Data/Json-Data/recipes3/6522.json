We always make it following a ham dinner so we can use the ham bone.  You have to try this recipe.  Serve with \"Angel's Yummy Bruschetta. \r\n\r\nFeb 18, 2012 Review: Wow!  I love yellow pea soup from the can - never had I tried making a dried pea soup before.  I've tried other cooks handy work at pea soup and couldn't finish the bowl.  I had a nice ham bone and husband's encouragement - so I stayed as true to the recipe as I could.  I used 2 cups of homeade chicken stock and 6 cups of water with 2 packets of Knorr chicken OXO and three table spoons of chicken bovril. All else same-same. My children age 17 and 13 finished their bowls and we all agreed to add this recipe to the regular menu.  Yes, it's that good!  Thank you!",
