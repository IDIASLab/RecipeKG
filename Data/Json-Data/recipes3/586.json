I made this recipe, using poultry seasoning instead of the Italian, and we really liked it.  My hubby likes crispiness, so at the end of the baking time, I topped these off with a couple of minutes under the broiler. Tender and very tasty!",

After dipping in butter season with salt pepper garlic powder and any other seasonings you want to use. The Italian seasoning was pretty yummy! I used Keebler Club Crackers they are very buttery. I put them in a gallon sized plastic bag and used the rolling pin to crush them. it is important to get the crumbs as fine as possible. Set the livers so they aren't touching on a cookie sheet or baking pan. Check them after 20- 30 minutes; small or thin livers will be done earlier than fat ones. At 25 minutes I ate the thin ones all up and turned the fat ones over for another 5 minutes; even the fattest chicken liver I had was done at a total of 30 minutes. I gave this 4 stars because even though it is healthier than my usual recipe livers are much better fried with bacon and crispy caramelized onions. This was simply a little bland although I enjoyed trying something new! I will post a photo tomorrow!",

This recipe is fantastic as an alternative to oil burns from the inevitable popping livers in the frying pan. Broiling for the last couple minutes of baking really gives them a nice crisp crust. I also cut crackers with breadcrumbs so that the livers are fully coated. Excellent recipe!!!",
