I loved the use of heavy cream and sour cream rather than the typical evaporated milk component; the texture of this pie was sublimely silky and rich.  I halved this recipe for one pie and reduced the sugar by half again and it was plenty sweet enough for us.  This WILL be my go-to pumpkin pie recipe forevermore.  I used pumpkin pur\u00e9e that I roasted, pur\u00e9ed and froze previously so this recipe didn't really take much time to make at all.",

I made half the recipe, and made it gluten-free by using a GF crust and omitting the flour.  I used half the amount of sugar (so 1/2 c. for one pie) and substituted dark muscovado for the demerara, which gave it a richer flavor.  (You could use a high-quality dark brown sugar.)  I baked it in a 9\" tart pan at 425 degrees for 20 minutes, then lowered the oven temp to 375 and baked another 25 minutes.  Planning to make another using light sour cream.  I agree with the others--will never use canned pumpkin again!",
