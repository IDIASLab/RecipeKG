How can it be a chocolate cake without cocoa powder in the batter? So I put some in, and it turned out pretty well.\nI have 9\" pans instead of 8\" so I increased the batter to 10 servings (25% increase in volume). I added 1/3 cup of cocoa powder (could stand 1/2 cup) and 1/4 cup of oil to make up for the extra butter. Otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely. (Oh, I didn't have espresso powder, so I powdered some regular coffee in a grinder and used that.) The cake took about 30-35 minutes to cook, presumably because it was larger. I made the original amount of frosting, which was plenty even for my larger cake. \nThe frosted cake is light, very rich, and has good flavor.",
