I did skip the milk/egg batter just used the beer/flour mix and certainly did NOT let it sit for 3 hours first: half hour worked fine for me. I added some all season salt and a dash of lemon pepper seasoning to the beer batter and fried a variety of veggies (green peppers onions and zucchini). We enjoyed these alot! Although I normally don't fry my veggies (as it severly decreases the nutritional value of the vegetables) this was a nice change and I might do it again every once in a while.",

The batter came out too hard when finished that is the part of the batter that stayed on. It took nearly 1 1/2 hours to fry less than 2 lbs of vegetables. I will admit that the taste was not terrible once done but who wants to go through that much trouble for an appetizer or side dish? Really? I was so frustrated at the end that it could have tasted like ambrosia from the Heavens and I would not have appreciated it. I will definitely NOT be making this again. Sorry D.J. Two thumbs down!",
