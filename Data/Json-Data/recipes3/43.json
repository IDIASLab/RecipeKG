I didn't really like the sauce to start with so instead of trashing it I added 1 beef bouillion cube, about a Tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and let it cook down.  It still wasn't the consistancy I liked so I added a little bit of cornstarch just the thicken it a little.  The balsamic vinegar gave it a little swang and the beef bouillion is what did the trick for me.  I added the meat back to the sauce and it was great.  My husband even liked it and he is somewhat fussy when it comes to new recipes.  We will use this one again.",
