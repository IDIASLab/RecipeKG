The ingredients list however calls for chicken broth in the sauce this would be a veloute sauce not a b\u00e9chamel. Since croquettes are indeed traditionally bound with a b\u00e9chamel sauce that s what I chose to do; this amounted to substituting milk for the chicken broth. That said I can t say I was impressed with either the recipe (I chose to execute it differently than written) or the finished product which was fairly tasteless and I m not one to generally complain about a dish being boring or bland. As for the sauce this too was a disappointment plain and depending on a trio of herbs that didn t benefit the sauce. So glad I limited it to just thyme. I think a turkey or chicken gravy would have been a better accompaniment.",
