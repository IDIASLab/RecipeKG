I'm lazy so I used steam in the bag broccoli and cauliflower and nuked for only 2:40 to keep them al dente (from this point I followed directions). I had a hunk of fresh Romano so I used them in place of parmesan. There was also no baking time (that I could find) so i baked at 400 because that's what I was baking another side dish at. I baked for about 30 minutes and broiled at the end to brown the bread crumbs/cheese. THANKS for the recipe!",

I followed another reviewer and did NOT precook the cauliflower, as I prefer my veg with texture.  I'm used to even measures of butter and flour when I make a roux, so instead of 2 tablespoons of flour, I upped it to to 4 to evenly match the 1/4 cup of butter. I had cream to use up, so I used that with a little milk to make it fully 1 1/4 cups.  I followed other reviewers (thank you!) and cooked the casserole at 400 for 25 minutes covered and 25 minutes uncovered.  This is the first vegetable casserole recipe I made that did NOT include cream-of-something soup.  It's a keeper!  Thank you MikeP!****FORGOT TO MENTION****I shredded the cheeses myself instead of buying pre-shredded cheese for maximum cheesiness.",

I cooked the veg in the microwave. Added a little dijon to the egg mix. Used Pepperidge farm herb dressing (it was in the freezer) instead of croutons and forgot the butter. I did cover the dish with foil for the first 20 mins. Uncovered it then added some olive oil to the dry dressing and it came out perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. Enjoy.",
