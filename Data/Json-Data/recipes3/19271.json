It isn't as easy as the one with the cream of chicken soup but the flavor greatly surpasses the \"easy\" one.  (not that this is difficult at all, it just takes a few more minutes to prepare.)  Very tasty, VERY creamy!  My husband, who loves chicken pot pie said this was the best he had tasted.  I agree.  Thank you for your recipe.  NOTE:  I use two crusts: one on top, one on the bottom.  It does increase the fat and calories but the taste is worth the extra time on the treadmill!!!  You may have to add to the cooking time with two crusts.  I just judge by the appearance of the top and the bottom is always done.",

I used 1 can chicken broth w/roasted veg flavoring to cook chicken.  I added more like 5 tbs of butter to cook the onion/celery-I used a heaping 1/3 cup flour and added the whole can of broth and like 3 cups of milk/heavy cream mixture.  I wanted alot of sauce to make sure it was plenty of liquid.  I used corn, peas, cooked cut up carrots and potatoes(microwave cooks potatoes in no time), and salt and pepper to taste.  I then poured my pot pie filling in the pie plates and topped with bisquick mixture(makes a great thick top crust-1 cup bisquick, 1/2 milk and 1 egg mix and pour on top)  then cooked for 30 minutes.  OH MY!!! DELICIOUS.  I think the flavored chicken broth added such wonderful flavors. I've found a keeper with this recipe!",
