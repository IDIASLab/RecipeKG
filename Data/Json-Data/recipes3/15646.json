And, what incredibly delicious, soggy fries they are. While I don't have any problem with you buying the cheese curds, or using frozen fries, I do hope you make the sauce from scratch. Use beef chuck, short rib, or brisket to achieve this marvelously meaty, super savory, ridiculously rich gravy that makes all the sogginess worth it.",
