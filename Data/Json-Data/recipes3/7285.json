I didn't have a bag to marinade the leg in so I did it in a shallow glass baking dish and halfway through the night flipped it over. I used dry herbs instead of fresh. I followed the recipe but cooked it in the same pan (I washed it). I had a smaller leg but it still required the same amount of time to cook maybe because my oven is an old one provided in my apartment or because the leg was very meaty. The wine flavours was prominent but I didn't taste the orange juice at all. I used the concentrate which I watered down as I normally would when making it; next time I'll use the concentrate as is without diluting it. It wasn't as tender as I'm used to but I blame that on my inexperience with cooking lamb and my dinky oven. Overall the lamb turned out pretty well and I plan on trying this recipe out until I get it right. Thanks for submitting this as it was a nice change to the usual rosemary garlic and red wine version!",
