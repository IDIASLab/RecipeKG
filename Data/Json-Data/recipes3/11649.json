I used Hatch Green Chile because I'm from New Mexico and would never use anything else. I used some italian bread crumbs instead of all of the bread to cut on carbs etc. Because of that I had to cook it a little bit longer - maybe 15 minutes. I added a little sour cream and avocado.

Next time we'll enjoy it as is!!",
