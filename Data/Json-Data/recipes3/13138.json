It's super tasty and very easy. I have to make 2 loaves because it's a favorite. I have toyed with the recipe and added all kinds of spice, but found that good old salt and pepper has the best flavor; go figure! Don't worry about excess butter coating the bread; when the hot loaf comes off the grill, the butter will melt in. We only eat wheat bread, but white would taste just fine.",

Since gluten free baguettes don't hold well sliced lengthwise, I seasoned one side with Salt and Pepper as directed and the other half with a Garlic/Herb Sea Salt. While both were good, I preferred the salt and pepper side. Will definitely be making this again and again! Thank you for the recipe FF5!",
