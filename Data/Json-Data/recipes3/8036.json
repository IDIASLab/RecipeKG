Perhaps I missed it but I don t see where the oil listed in the ingredients is supposed to go. I place in cavity of bird. 180 degrees is far too high and will result in a drier than needed chicken. All safety recommendations point to 165 degrees for poultry that is done moist and free of bacteria. With those adjustments it was very good. Finally we used a raised wire plate over a roasting pan so it did not need to be turned. The skin was still crisp all over.",

I would recommend this as an easy during the week meal that enhances not masks the chicken. I used some fresh sage and lemon balm from my garden and used fresh garlic diced rather than garlic salt.
