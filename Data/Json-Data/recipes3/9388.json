I have never made gravy before, but using this recipe it turned out good (I did not use the half and half in my gravy, although I may try it in the future).  I could not find the exact cut of meat called for, so all I had was a 2 lb boneless, skinless turkey breast.  I did make the same amount of butter mixture and rubbed it all over the outside of the turkey breast.  My turkey did not take very long at all to cook, only about 40 minutes or so.  I used the leftover turkey and gravy in a pot pie the next day.",

I would like to say that if you have the 3 lb turkey breast (Mine was Butterball brand) that comes with the netting wrapped around it, if you take the netting off, the breast loses shape. I had to re-tie with string and while it did not look as good as the turkey breast usually looks, it cooked great. It was very moist and tender and tasted wonderful too. Next time, I will not remove the netting and will just rub the outside and maybe inject the butter mix inside under the skin with my injecter set.  My injecter needle is large, so I don't think it will be clogged using my jarred minced garlic. Since it is only the 2 of us eating, I will use the lefover turkey and gravy to make a turkey pot pie this week.  I saw several good recipes on this site for that. (I served with rice and salad.  The gravy was great on the rice too!) Thanks for giving us a recipe that adds flavor to an old favorite!",

It took about two and a half hours to cook, and I kept the tented foil on for the first 2 hours. I basted it probably 3 times during cooking, and kept most of the drippings, (not just 1-2 Tbsp), to make the gravy. \n   It turned out fantastic-juicy, tasty, and an incredible gravy, which I used the next night for Turkey and Gravy in pastry shells. So much easier than cooking the whole bird, and not a scrap was leftover.",

The times provided in the recipe was perfect for me, and the meat was wonderfully tender. For the gravy, I used almost ALL the drippings, and I used chicken stock (not cream), which gave me a lot of delicious gravy.
