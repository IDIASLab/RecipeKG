I suggest sauteing them on med-low heat for at least 6-8 mins on their own before adding the scallions and garlic. Then add the broth and simmer for 5-6 mins before adding the orzo, and continue simmering til orzo is done.  Finally, add the spinach and stir til softened.  Tip: if you are making the soup ahead of time, undercook the orzo slightly.  Makes a nice, healthy lunch! So yummy! I'm definitely  making this again!",

Even nicer to find a soup that accommodates additional vegetables, like a celery stick or two, or some chopped summer squash (yellow or green).\n\nI brighten all soups with a t. of fresh lemon juice, and I did this one.
