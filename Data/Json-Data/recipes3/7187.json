This makes a lot of sauce I mixed it with the angel hair pasta at the end like I would spaghetti and it was still a lot of extra sauce. I also added about 3/4 container of shredded parmesan and some mushrooms the sauce would have been way too thin for my liking without the parmesan. But the recipe had a good taste my crawfish were left over from a crawfish boil so they added some more seasoning and I added Tony's Chachere but seasoning is a personal choice being from Cajun Country we like our spice!!
