I loved the combination of all the ingredients together but you know I really think this dip could use some parmesan cheese. Not much just a touch to give it a little bit of that flavor.",

I have made it a couple more times since then for get togethers and myself. I do add a small amount of some strong pungent flavored cheeses when I make it for myself because that is how I like it. The down side is I don't know the starting calorie count before I add the extra cheeses and I tend to eat more of this dip then I should. Yes it is that good.",

So when I saw this receipe and realized it did not involve mayo I had to try it and I am glad I did!! My grocery store was out of sourdough rounds so I served it in a bowl with cubed sourdough bread. It was a huge hit!! The bowl looked like it had been licked clean. This one is a keeper!!",
