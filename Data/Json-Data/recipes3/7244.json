I wanted to add chicken so I just cut chicken breasts into bite size pieces seasoned with salt and peper and cooked them with the onions and garlic. I also had some really fresh tomatoes so I chopped them into small pieces and added them to the top of the dish after it was on the plate. This made a wonderful addition.

After reading everyone's issues with thickness and especially since I am a carbonara expert (Thanks Dad!) the best way to get desired thickness is a low flame for 20-30 minutes constant stirring and if necessary 2 tbsp of cornstarch and 2 tbsp of cold water mixture. Other than the usual additions of shrimp chicken or veggies I wouldn't have changed a thing!!",

I add a ton of chopped mushrooms with the onion ( I put mushrooms in everything) I also add 2 TBSP of flour to the butter mixture to thicken it a little. I use Fat Free Half and Half (that's why it needs thickened a little). Much healthier and I don't miss the cream! Also put in a pinch of nutmeg and 1/2 cup of shredded mozzerella. Delicious!!",
