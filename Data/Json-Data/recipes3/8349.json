We do live in crab-land and it's summer so that did not surprise me. Next time I will increase the S&P and use fresh basil instead of dried and maybe add a little garlic and onion to really make it pop. Thanks!",

One thing that I like about this is that the stuffing doesn\u2019t overshadow the actual flavor of the fresh tomato, they share equally.  Quick and easy, healthy, and most importantly, TASTY!",
