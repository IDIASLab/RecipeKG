The almond flour, oat flour, and chia or hemp seeds may be found in your grocery store's organic or gluten-free section, at Trader Joe's&reg;, or online. My family isn't gluten free (my sister is!), but we all prefer this recipe to any others.",

I only had quick oats and while  I can see that using rolled oats would make the texture different it's 100% fine with quick oats. OH and  I used 1c brown sugar and no fake sugar.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.",
