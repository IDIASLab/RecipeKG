I used canned corn & canned crab (I only had 12 oz. of the lump crab & used a 6 oz. can of fancy white....I didn't care for the fancy white & will make sure I have enough lump for next time) I added a tsp. of Old Bay & also a can of cream style corn. Next time I think I will try the suggestion of using whipping cream instead of the half & half to add thickness. I meant to top it w/ parmesan cheese but it tasted so good I forgot! Update 5/28/06--- Made this for lunch again today but this time I used fresh king crab leftover from last night...fresh is definitely best but then we knew that already.;o) I also used fresh corn this time & to be honest I like it better w/ canned or frozen. Instead of sprinkling w/ parmesan I made Parmesan Crisps (from foodnetwork site) to garnish them w/ & they were so cute!",

What I noticed right away was that the bay took over and gave the entire dish a cloying bay flavor. So I just used one leaf and at that I took it out after the 10 minute simmer. That brought the bay into balance. The other thing I noticed was a lack of seafood flavor in the finished product. So, I substituted 28 oz of clam juice for 28 oz of chicken broth. I also substituted 1/2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning, which has a minimal bay contribution, ironically, for 1/2 tsp Cajun Seasoning. These changes  mellowed out the bay while adding seafood flavor.",
