It wasn't difficult to make, I followed the recipe exactly.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan and cooked it maybe 5 extra minutes, no broiler needed.  I served it with sliced baguette and Ritz which were good but people also enjoyed it with potato chips and fresh veggies. I wouldn't have guessed it had clams in it since the flavor was subtle but it definitely added something. If you want a stronger clam flavor, try another can or two of clams. Definitely a must try, thank you Chef John!",
