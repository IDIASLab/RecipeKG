I can see many ways this could be jazzed up...but for me, the flavours combine perfectly \"as is.\"  Thanks for a filling, yummy cup of comfort!",

Two, I layer the eggs with bread torn into small pieces instead of crackers.  You can also add shredded cheese layers, breakfast meats, sauteed onions, etc.  The possibilities are really endless.",

We used to call these \"Gramma's Eggs\" because my maternal Grandmother used to make these -- especially when I was sick or needed comfort -- except she used one slice of buttered bread per egg torn or cut into pieces. instead of the crackers. Instead of peeling the eggs we cracked them open (with a knife) and then scooped out the insides with a spoon into the cup. I found that three minutes was not enough (my whites were still a little runny) so I think I will cook them for four or five minutes next time. (Not enough to \"ding\" the recipe if the stove is slow.) Thanks again!",

Could make coffee, turn on radio, putter around and his eggs were perfect. Runny yolk, NOT runny whites. He always ate them in a coffee mug.He cooked the eggs in a small saucepan and just before the eggs were done, he would put some butter in the cup and place it in the saucepan to melt the butter, then scoop the perfectly cooked eggs into the cup. A little S + P, quick mix. He has been gone many years, I'm now 59 and that is absolutely the only way I eat my soft boiled eggs. But sadly I have never been able to get the timing right. Always have a piece of buttered toast ready to break up into cup to soak up and hide the runny white.",
