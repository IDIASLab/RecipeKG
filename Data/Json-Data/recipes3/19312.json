This is was very very flavorful. I served it over egg noodles with steamed spinach. My kids even enjoyed the chicken. I will make this one again.",

Before I browned the chicken I dredged it in flour seasoned w/ s&p and a trace of chipotle powder for a touch of smoke as I don't eat red meat (the bacon). Since I used the flour and no bacon I added a bit more oil before sauteeing the veggies. I included a couple of coarsely diced carrots and 2 minced cloves of garlic w/ the onions & mushrooms as I'd seen in other similar recipes. Two full-sized tomatoes make a lb. if like most Americans you don't have a food scale. For the cooking wine I chose a decent Garnacha--an inexpensive low tannin Spanish red but if you can get Dolcetto on sale that would be great. Don't forget to offer lots of crusty Italian bread to sop up the sauce.",
