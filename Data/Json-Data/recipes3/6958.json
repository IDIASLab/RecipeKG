I used 2 beers and added garlic and Old Bay Spice as well. The shrimp was divine! Great with pasta and French bread to suck up all the juices. I have frozen the rest of the broth for fish sou someday. So even though I inadvertently cut the butter WAY down (and I am a butter freak) it was superb and I will keep to the one stick whenever I make this dish again.",
