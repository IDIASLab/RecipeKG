In Scotland the modern usage in Scotland is Scottish or Scots and the word \"Scotch\" is only applied to specific products mostly food or drink such as Scotch whisky Scotch pie Scotch broth and Scotch eggs. Grammar lesson over. These are very good Shortbread (biscuits in most of europe) and are very traditional tho many people have their idea of what shortbread should be... Traditional shortbread was made from just 3 ingredients (flour Butter and Sugar) and should be dry and crumbly. The cooling process hardens them up but I find that putting them in a coffee can lined with paper towels for a week or two makes them \"finish\" to become a delicious treat.",

Not only was the recipe easy to follow but it was also quick and low maintenance so I could mix and bake the cookies while doing something else. I made 73 cookies out of this recipe but maybe my cookies are smaller than some people's. Mine are triangles a smidgen smaller than say chips ahoy cookies. I also made a simple glaze out of lemon juice water and sugar and dipped my cookies in that. It was amazing! The only problem is that I have way too many of these rich fluffy little cookies to eat all by my self!",
