I added some canned diced tomatoes and more olive oil than called for. I used shredded Parmesean rather than the powdered kind. While eating it I thought it needed a texture... I opted for creamy and added a touch of sour cream of all things. I actually really enjoyed it with the sour cream! I LOVE sour cream though. May not work for everyone. Just a suggestion! As stated I agree with the other reviewers that said it was lacking moisture and flavor.",
