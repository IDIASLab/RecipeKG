The directions don't say it but that you have to rinse the salt from the beef first and then chop the beef into tiny pieces. I reserved some of the chopped dried beef to roll the finished balls in. Great with veggie sticks Wheat Thins Big crackers and Triscuit crackers. I made two smaller cheese balls. A keeper... great meat and cheese ball recipe!",
