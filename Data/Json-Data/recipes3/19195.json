I rubbed that into the de-skinned chicken thighs and poured that over the chicken and let it \"marinate\".\nI cooked it like that and didn't add the cheese until the last ten minutes of the cooking, to prevent it from burning.\n\nThis was tasty. I paired it with the Mexican Sour Cream Rice from this site.",

Browning the chicken in a skillet before finishing in the oven provides a lot of flavor and is a step, I believe, that should not be omitted. I seasoned it liberally with salt, pepper, garlic powder and cumin - MUCH more than the \"pinch\" called for, and browned it in butter. The result after browning looked like blackened chicken. The rest of the preparation was a snap - spoon on a good salsa, top with shredded Cheddar and minutes later the dish is ready to serve. Since the chicken is pretty much cooked before it goes into the oven, care should be taken not to overcook it. Hubs and I really enjoyed this, served with Best Black Beans and Spanish Rice with Bacon, recipes also from this site. ",

I needed something easy for a late night supper for me and my husband.  I used two chicken breasts and there's no need to brown the chicken first.  I just sprinkled both sides with garlic powder, salt, cracked black pepper, cumin and a little chili powder.  I used a thick and chunky salsa and poured all 16 oz. into an 8x8 baking dish at 350 for 45 minutes.  The last 5 minutes I grated pepper jack cheese over top.  To make the presentation a little better I chopped some green onion and sliced black olives on top and served with sour cream and a side of spanish rice.

Although the flavor was good and the chicken was moist inside, I didn't care for the texture of the outside of the skinless chicken breasts.  Under the salsa and cheese the outside of the breasts were too dry.  If I make this again, I don't think I'll brown the breasts first or if I do, I'll bread them.  In my opinion I think this would be better if the breasts baked with the salsa in a 400 degree oven and then add the cheese about 10 mins before they're done cooking.  Skip the browning all together.",
