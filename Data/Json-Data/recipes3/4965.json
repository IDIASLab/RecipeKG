For those that found this pizza grease I have a little change to share: Instead of the pepperoni use extra lean ground beef you may add a little extra flavor by using red and green peppers chopped. One more trick is to let the sauce cool down before adding to the crust so that the crust doesn't become soggy while baking.",
