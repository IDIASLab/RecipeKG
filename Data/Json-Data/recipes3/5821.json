Now, I have to admit, I think \"steak sauce\" is an insult to a good steak, but what I was having tonight wasn't good steaks, it was some super thin cuts of round that I would be frying and with that, I like steak sauce.  I'm out of both steak sauce and money to buy steak sauce so I found this recipe and had all the ingredients so I whipped it up.  I'm eating it now and loving it!  My only change was to use spicy brown mustard because I'm out of plain yellow.  Thanks for cracking the steak sauce code!  (And fyi for some reviewers:  It doesn't taste just like A-1, or 57, because it's NOT either one of those things, but it IS very tasty.)",

For him eating a steak without A-1 is like, hmmmm, for me eating a cheeseburger without pickles and sauteed onions.  The Worcestershire gave it the A-1 flavor and the vinegar the appropriate tang.  And, as always, in consideration of his sensitive innards, I left out the hot sauce.  It won't make him a convert from his A-1 (his fault, by the way, for not writing it on the grocery list as it ran low!), but it sure was a lifesaver for his steak in a pinch.",
