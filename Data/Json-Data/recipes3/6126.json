There are only a couple of things I changed here; first I cooked the bacon and onions in a little bit of olive oil with a pinch of sugar and put in about triple the garlic. Also I didn't add the cilantro at the end because it tasted perfect without it. And it only took me about an hour from start to finish. This is a recipe I'll be making often. Thanks!",

Maybe I shouldn't have followed a few reviewers advice and added in the cooked bacon at the end of cooking.It added a very strange texture that did not go well with refried beans. I tasted it before I put the bacon in and loved it - would have given it 5 stars. It was similar to the beans you can get in many authentic mexican restaraunts. It also took considerably longer to cook than stated. Once adding in the chicken stock it took a little over 2 hours. So that was 3 hours total for a side dish. However the time issues didn't bother me as much as adding in the bacon ruined the dish. Perhaps putting the bacon in at the beginning of the cooking process would have changed the end result. But bacon in this dish is not needed. The cilantro is a must. I have made this dish several more times with out the bacon - 5 stars for sure. I always double the recipe and use the leftovers later in other dishes.",
