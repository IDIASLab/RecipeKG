This dish is totally vegetarian and can be vegan just be substituting veggie oil for the ghee. If you want it mild, don't add the curry or vindaloo spices. If you want some kick to it, add your favorite curry or vindaloo blend. Fantastic with chicken tikka masala and tabouleh!",

This will not be my last time to make these. I would suggest using an eggplant with a soft peel or expect to peel them once cooked. The skin was inedible. Without soaking them in salt water initially did affect the texture. Thank you for the recipe.",
