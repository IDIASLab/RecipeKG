This satisfied all my needs AND I got to relax and enjoy a glass of wine while it was doing the brunt of the \"cooking\" - no active babysitting of the stovetop necessary. Talk about a winning weeknight meal. ;)",

                "reviewBody": "This was not worth making in our opinion. First, the instructions are not specific. It tells you to lay the shrimp out in a single layer on the baking sheet, then add peppers, onion etc & mix with the shrimp. Well why put the shrimp in a single layer 1st, why not just mix it all together & then spread out evenly. The second thing that was strange is after it bakes with ingredients all mixed, your to take the shrimp off & broiled the peppers.  OK, but the shrimp is all mixed in & a pain to dig through everything. My third problem was you hardly tasted the fajita seasoning. Since we just made the Quick and Easy Shrimp Fajitas from this website we'll stick with that because you use a whole package of fajita or taco mix, & no messing trying to separate peppers, onions & shrimp.  You fry the peppers & onion then set aside & do the shrimp. This to me is much easier.  For those who want to mess around go for it, but I like quick & easy without fuss.",
