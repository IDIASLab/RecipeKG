Used probably about two tablespoons of fresh dill and added a teaspoon of horseradish. Piped into some premade phyllo cups and garnished with another sprig of dill. Very tasty creamy salmon dish. Received several complements and I would definitely make this again. It did honestly only take about 15 minutes to make and I made the mousse the day before refrigerated and then piped into phyllo just before leaving the house just to ensure they kept from getting soggy. I didn't notice that the flavor changed too much overnight one way or the other by the way.",
