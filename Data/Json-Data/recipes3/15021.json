I steam the wings in a large double pot for 10 minutes dry with paper towels refrigerate for 1 hour. Then pull out your wings and prepare them per the recipe.  I like cookie sheets with parchment paper. Your wings will have much less fat and remain very juicy. great tip I got from a competitive BBQ expert.",
