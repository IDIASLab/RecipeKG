If you are serving it as a side, it'll feed 5- to 6 people. As a main. I would say 2 or 3, but 4 is probably more reasonable for normal vegetable eaters.... Do not skimp on the salt, pepper, and nutmeg otherwise the casserole will be too bland (but you can of course always salt at the table).",

I used a gruyere-Swiss cheese mixture instead of Cheddar cause I had it left over from making fondue and sprinkled some extra cheese on top. do NOT skimp on the cream - you want to cover the potatoes and Brussels' sprouts with the creamy-eggy mixture and also make sure to really season the eggs. Neither the Brussels' sprouts nor the potatoes will have a lot of flavor on their own so all the flavor comes from the topping. I used tiny potatoes and pre-cooked them together with the Brussels' sprouts for 5 minutes",
