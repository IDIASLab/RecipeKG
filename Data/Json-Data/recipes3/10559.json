I added some minced garlic with my spices when mixing the shrimp, and then a splash of heavy cream to my sauce after cooking the shrimp. It mellowed out the lime juice and coated the shrimp just perfectly. Also, I added some romaine lettuce and avocados to my tacos and it was wonderful. A great recipe all around, especially the ranch/siracha sauce!",
