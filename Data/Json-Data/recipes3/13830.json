The best I could do was smash it into smaller pieces.  I used Green Giant\u00ae Steam Crisp white corn, and it really had next to no liquid in the can, very little to drain.  I had a glob of cream cheese when I added the flour-milk mixture to the skillet, and just had to add more and more and MORE milk to even come close to getting anything that resembled a sauce.  My husband\u2019s comment was that this tasted pretty good, but just wasn\u2019t \u201ccreamy.\u201d  It is super quick and easy to make, and it\u2019s tasty, but it does need a little tweaking.  Garnished with some Hot & Spicy Jalape\u00f1os from Trader Joe\u2019s for serving.",
