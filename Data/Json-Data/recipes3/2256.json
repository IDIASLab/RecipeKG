I pureed all of that together (my kids don't like 'chunky' soup) until smooth. I added some light cream I had in the fridge and used finely shredded mild cheddar instead of Asiago cheese.... It tasted great! I had some leftover soup in a container and the next day I made up a sort of 'lasagne' dish using this soup as the \"sauce\"! I figured I didn't even need to add anything to it; not even the cheese! I cooked up some ground beef alternately layered the (cold) soup lasagne noodles chopped fresh baby spinach and ground beef in a casserole dish and baked it all up until brown & bubbly. It came out great and the fam had no idea it was the potato cheese soup from the previous day! So this recipe easily \"stretches\". Thanks!",

I didn't have asaigo cheese so I used a combo of real grated parmesan and romano cheese instead. I'm not allowed to use my blender (due to a previous soup puree incident)so I used my hand mixture instead. The result was like really runny mashed potatoes...I even added a little more milk to get it more to a soup consistency without success. The taste seemed to need some more spices too. Overall it was okay and really easy but I'm not sure if I'd make this one again.",

I chose to add 4 cloves of garlic (because garlic makes everything better and just seemed a happy threesome with potatoes and cheese) to the onions/potatoes/broth. I had to eyeball/guesstimate the pound of potatoes but I did my best (peeling the white potatoes first). I'm way too lazy to do the whole blender thing so I used my immersion blender instead and it worked like a charm. While the potatoes et al were boiling (the 10 minutes was spot on for me) I saut\u00e9ed the chopped baby bells and diced red bell in a pat of butter to soften them up. I used white pepper dried parsley and season salt to season (as well as salting the broth/potatoes as they boiled). The texture/appearance wasn't quite company worthy but it tasted good and I'm looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow. THANKS for the recipe!",
