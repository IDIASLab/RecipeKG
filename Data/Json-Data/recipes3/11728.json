I do suggest making the dipping sauce to go along with it. Soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, green onions, sesame oil, sesame seeds, Korean chili powder and sugar. Let the sauce sit before eating. I feel the flavor a meld together better. I usually made my sauce the night before or several hours before I made the Mandu.",
