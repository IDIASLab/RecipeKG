A couple of things to mention. You really need to drain the grease from the hamburger. The one change I made was that I browned the sausage in the skillet while the beef was draining and discarded the grease from that as well. It was still on the greasy side so draining is a must. The recipe doesn't say how long to cook the chili once you bring it to a boil and then reduce the heat. I let mine simmer for 45 minutes.",
