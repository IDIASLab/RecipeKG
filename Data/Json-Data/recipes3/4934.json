This is important, I let the batter sit for 1/2 hour before I used it.  If fried up perfectly.  My whole family loved it.",

Oddly enough he thought those were pretty good but I have a feeling he was just trying to save my feelings. I found some pre-made frozen ones at Walmart so they're just going to have to do.
