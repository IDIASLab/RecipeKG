I used 2 cups of 3.5% milk not 1/2 & 1/2 only 1 tsp. of salt and added a pinch of crushed red pepper. I added in small meatballs for protein and garnished with green onions - delicious!",

I used bockwurst and added it with the potatoes to brown it up a little. That meant that when I used the stick blender it blended up the sausage too but that was just fine.
