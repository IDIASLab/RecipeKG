Generally anything called \"Healthier\" doesn't go over well. BUT I have been trying to get away from red meat and striving for meatless and tried this. Used regular pasta and breadcrumbs no wheat variations. Regular cheddar cheese no lowfat available. Definitely worth a try if you're on the fence. Will be making this regularly.",

After baking and taking the first bite the husband and I groaned - it's so cheesy and good. After gobbling down his portion the husband said 'This mac and cheese is RIDICULOUS'. Perfect accompaniment (and so easy to make) for ribs or burgers with a salad. No one cheese stands out and the hubby was even a little skeptical 'Hmm cottage cheese huh?' but it all worked out. I thought it was a little dry not sure what I'd do to make it a little saucier - maybe milk like others have said? I agree with the others - the topping is good but not needed.",
