I had really thin spears, so I quickly blanched them until they just started to get tender, and then plunged them into a bowl of ice water.  After you've rolled them up, they bake for about ten minutes, so be careful not to initially cook the asparagus to mush.  Ours had the perfect \"crunch\" that we like in fresh asparagus.  I could see adding some parmesan to the cream cheese mixture to enhance flavor even more.  Cut in half, these would be great appetizers/finger food for a buffet table.  We're trying to enjoy as much spring asparagus as we can because it's so flavorful and fresh this time of year.  Very nice recipe.",

LOL I confess I did not stick to to the recipe but used the foundation which was clearly solid thus the 5 stars. My version also let the cream cheese come to approximately room temp which was liberally not generously spread on the thinned decrusted bread slices (wheat). Sprinkle with minced green onions and a light sprinkle of hot pepper flakes. Followed by a generous sprinkle of grated parm/reggiano cheese. Then a half slice of Boars Head Rosemary Deli Ham you can get away with a quarter of a slice but my hubby insisted on half a slice for a little extra. Topped by blanched iced asparagus roll and brushed with butter flavored with roasted garlic (minced garlic roasted in butter then strain out the minced garlic pieces). Done! Very easy and quick. Get the prep work is done then this can be done in line process and put in the oven. I did cut the final product in half to make more like finger food and to stretch out servings. This was the 2nd quickest hor devour to go was beat out by a very good stuffed cohog. I got compliments from everyone one person insisted I make this for their party when we come. We had left overs I made more the next day as our lunch.",
