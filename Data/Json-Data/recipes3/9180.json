First time I completely forgot to stir while it was cooking. The liquid wasn't absorbed enough and there was a bit of a \"crust\" on the bottom of the rice cooker. Not too bad. I gave it a stir and pushed the lever to cook again. A few minutes later the lever popped and the polenta was ready to add the cheese. I do cheat a bit. Use 1 Tbls of butter or olive oil dried onions and garlic powder. I also add a splash or white wine or sherry. You can easily change out the type and amount of cheese used to fit your taste or alter to whatever your main is.",
