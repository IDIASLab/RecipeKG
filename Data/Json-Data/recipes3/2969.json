After chopping, I had a little less than 1/4 cup of mixture to mix in w/the yogurt and cucumber. Instead of cheese cloth, I used coffee filters and that worked great.

I put the Greek yogurt in the processor along with the salt pepper crushed garlic and 1/2 cup whole mint leaves (loosely packed). Then I pulsed it for a bit to coarsely chop the mint and garlic. After that I threw in the diced up cucumber and pulsed some more. The immediate results were DELICIOUS and I'm sure it will be even better after a night in the fridge.",

However the prep time could be seriously reduced if one used real Greek yogurt (like Oikos) that is already thick and does not require straining. I found this to be most difficult in my technologically challenged kitchen lacking cheesecloth or even the basic coffee filter. Needless to say mine turned out a bit runny:P Used the food processor to chop and mix everything up. Served with falafel lettuce and tomato on a pita. The consistency didn't ruin anything but will save myself the trouble and just use Greek yogurt next time.",
