Also, I never addedthe  red wine since I havent found one I like cooking with that isnt expensive.  When I brown the beef, I usually use up whatever onion and garlic I have left in my fridge and I have omitted the celery and bell pepper before (I have also added more than the recipe calls for the empty out my fridge)  All in all, this is a great recipe, and especially good when it's been sitting in the fridge a day or two.",

Also added cayenne pepper, 3 fresh garlic cloves and 1T garlic powder, 1 or 2tsp salt, 2T brown sugar, and a 4oz can of diced green chiles.  Went with the advice of another reviewer who wanted to kick it up for spiciness, but her recommendations were WAY too high when she suggested adding 1T cayenne pepper.  I used 1tsp and it was way too hot, and we like spicy food.  Next time, I'd bring it down to 1/4 to 1/2tsp.  I drained my beans, and so did not find the chili was soupy as some experienced, but as a result of the too-spicy effect, I did add 3 extra cans of beans and a medium can of tomato paste to tame it a little. I recommend \"squishing\" the tomatoes as they don't break down in the crockpot process.  I did use black beans, kidney beans, and pinto beans for a little variety and that was a nice touch.  The red wine addition added such a nice flavor to the dish.  Served with French Baguette from allrecipes and had a lemon sorbet for dessert with a touch of lemoncello to cool off our palates! ;-) Thank you, Wendy!",

I added 1 onion, 3 cloves of garlic, & 1/2 tablespoon of crushed red pepper (for a little heat). This chili is delicious & will offer a nice alternative to my meatier chili recipe this coming winter.

I thought the slow cooker would take care of that but I was wrong so will presquish next time)",
