For the first time we were on our own and we were excited to learn. I started searching for recipes and I stumbled across this one. It was fairly simple to make and the coating stuck great. Why did I only give it three stars then? Not enough salt in our opinion. Next time we will add more salt and probably add a fish seasoning. I wish I could give it more stars but it really lacked the flavor that I was hoping for. If you love salt, I would recommend adding a lot more. I used a 1/2 teaspoon and you couldn't even taste that.",
