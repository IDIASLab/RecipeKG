All the flavors melded so great!\nI read up on oil infusion and chose to do a heat infusion.\nThe risk of food poisioning goes down if you heat the herbs. Something about the fresh herbs having water content that causes botchilism. That's why you should use it quickly.\nThe heating makes it last a bit longer but still in the fridge.\n\nI bought oil bottles with spouts and sealing wax and dipped them in red wax to seal them for gifts. They were pretty with the red wax, jingle bell, red raffia ribbon and sprig of rosemary inside the bottle with the oil.\nVery nice!",

I use this for everything: instant marinade for chicken and pork, drizzle over salads, dipping oil for bread...the list goes on and on.  And actually, I found this is still good for up to 4 weeks if you store it in the fridge.  The oil will get a little cloudy but once you bring it back to room temperature the cloudiness will go away.  The flavor will get more intense as the oil ages, so be warned if you add garlic or any spicy flavorings.",

Oil by itself cannot grow bacteria, but herbs containing water can. Botulinum organisms can grow in food sources containing even trace amounts of water and cause botulism - a serious form of food poisoning. For this reason, blending and storing infused dipping oils without refrigeration is not recommended.",
