The filling is very manageable and seemed to hold its form better than regular stuffed eggs. Thanks!",

I did make a few changes. My changes: I got rid of the relish and miracle whip/salad dressing because I don't like either of those. (I used mayo instead of the miracle whip) I added some chopped celery and onions and chives (for crunch and flavor) I threw the yolks veggies mayo salt and pepper and chives into a food processor and blended everything up so there were not huge chunks of potato in the eggs I garnished with paprika and a few sprigs of chives. Overall a great dish. This is my new go to deviled egg recipe!",

I used dill relish mayonnaise a yukon gold potato dijon mustard and fresh ranch eggs. I the only thing I added was some garlic powder for added flavor and they were still very bland! I put the potato and other ingredients through the food processor. That was a mistake. The consistency was gluey. It may have been better if I had mashed the potato with a fork and folded it into the other stuff. Since I didn't I gave the recipe a second star to make up for it. If you really want potato salad stuffed eggs I suggest you use your regular potato salad recipe in small quantity and stuff the eggs with that.
