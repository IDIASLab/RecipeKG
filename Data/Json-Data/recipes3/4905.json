Boiled and mashed my red skin potatoes as usual with sour cream butter and rice milk. Then I heated and mixed in my leftover brussels sprouts. Wow!! I can't stop eating it even though I'm full! I love Colcannon with regular cabbage and with brussels sprouts it's totally awesome. Then again anything mixed into mashed taters is pretty awesome! Give the sprouts a try you won't be sorry!",
