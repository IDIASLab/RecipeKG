The resulting \"Vegetable Frittata\" was a huge hit. ~\n\nI was looking for an egg dish that had fresh veggies in it.  I found a highly rated Vegetable Frittata on AllRecipes that contained sauteed zucchini, mushroom, onion and bell pepper.  However, this recipe also contained lots of cream cheese, half & half and other rich ingredients.  While I'm SURE it was wonderful, it also had about 40 grams of fat per serving. ~\n\nI was wanting something a little healthier.  I followed this recipe as I always do, only I sauteed the veggies as instructed in the OTHER recipe, and used them in place of the green chiles. ~\n\nI mixed and bake the dish as instructed in this recipe.  Swapping the veggies for the green chiles was my ONLY alteration.  The dish was a HUGE hit -- my father-in-law AND my hubby (who's not a fan of zucchini) went back twice for more. ~\n\nFrom now on, I'll alternate between the original recipe and my new \"veggie frittata\" version.  GOOD STUFF!",

To make it a bit healthier half of the eggs I used were just egg-whites and I added saut\u00e9ed onions & mushrooms. The recipe tasted rich even with the low-fat cheeses. People raved!",

I had a couple of slices of leftover cooked bacon so I crumbled it and added to the ingredients. The dish made a satisfying dinner accompaniment.

I also sprinkled a little more cheese on and broiled the top just to give it some color. Next time I might try adding roasted red peppers or a few spoonfuls of salsa to give it more color and flavor.",
