I used real rum instead of extract & I only had half the amount of butter so I did half butter & half coconut oil. It worked great. It may have changed the consistency a bit, because I didn't need to roll into a ball, I just made \"patties\" with my hands & placed them on an un greased cookie sheet, which made wonderful cookies.",
