So after making this exactly as written once (and it was very good!), these are the changes that I made to make it even more healthy.  \n\nI used yukon gold potatoes (leaving peel on) because I found the russte to be a bit mealy.  I used 1 Tbls butter, 1 1/2 Tbls organic EVOO (a healthier fat).  I also used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the milk, this made it extra creamy.  Just before I added the cheese to the sauce, I put in a minced clove of garlic and a couple dashes of hot sauce.  \n\nThe changes were made because of my families personal tastes but this is the way we make them all the time now.",

It makes it so creamer and it tastes better. With your potatoes LEACH them which means to soak the starch out for about 3 hour's or longer it's better. Try using salt free seasoning or flavored and yes they have low Phosphorus their out there and let's not forget a little Garlic Powder. I love cheese even low fat but I did find a non-dairy cheese and I know what your going to say. YUCK!!! I did find a cheese and it's called Daiya (DAAYA) and many restaurant's use this cheese and you didn't even know it. HA! Instead of real butter use margarine instead or a Healthier Brand.",
