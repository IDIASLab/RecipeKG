I have tweaked this recipe to our taste, so the red pepper, capers, and black olives are simply a preference for us. The vinegar is a Spanish thing, so I always add it. You can leave a little broth in the paella, or cook until the broth is fully absorbed.  It is simply a preference.",

Last night I was not impressed at all but today the flavors seem to have developed. If I were to make this again I'd forgo the brown rice- it took longer to cook than called for in the recipe and I don't think that the texture works well in this one. Also I think the recipe assumed that I was using a narrower link of chorizo than is offered at my grocery store and I ended up with rather large pieces I wish I had diced it instead of slicing as called for.",
