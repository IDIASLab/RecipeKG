The only variation was that the other cook's version included chopped black olives diced tomatoes and finely minced basil. She said that sometimes she uses cilantro instead of basil and once even used minced capers (just a few) and even that was a slamming success. You are in for a big surprise with this potato salad =",

Other then the skins...I haven't changed the recipe not one bit. Love the flavor love the creamy-ness and love the fact that it's really easy to put together. It's worth trying.
