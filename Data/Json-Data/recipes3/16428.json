I used a canned spinach (its what I had) and instead of sour cream I used evaporated milk. I also used fat free cream of celery soup. I think this is such a great dish. Don't limit it to pasta. I served it as a side dish to my two girls (2&4) and they loved it! It tasted alot like the cream spinach they serve at Boston Market - one of my favorite things there! This would also be great on top of a chicken breast! Thank you so much for this recipe! A definate keeper!!!",
