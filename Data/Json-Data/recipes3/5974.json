If you are from the PA Dutch area or adventurous, this is a definite keeper.  Try it and I'm sure you will love it.  We omit the salt when cooking it because it can be added later.

Leave on a low heat in the oven (about 240 degrees) for about 5-6 hours. This gives everything enough time to simmer  slowly. It also leaves time for the pig to cook thoroughly. \nAnother variation is if you can't come across a pig (or the thought disgusts you), you can wrap it up in a tin foil-like log. \nLeave a little water on the bottom (with or without the pig) so nothing sticks to the pan and the juices tenderize the meat.",
