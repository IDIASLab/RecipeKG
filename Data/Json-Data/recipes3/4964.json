Like other's have said already I saw no point in wasting a perfectly good avocado so decided to make it part of the meal. I actually did not stuff them at all. I sliced the avocado squeezed a lime over it(both for flavor and to prevent browning) and used it as a bed for the filling. For the filling my valentine is allergic to shrimp so I used premium crab to make up for the lack of shrimp - the jumbo lump crab - I also put a little extra cucumber (someone here already said it but it bears saying again the cucumber really makes the dish so don't leave it out) some fresh dill and although it was valentine's day I couldnt help adding a few dashes of garlic powder - it was the perfect touch. I served it on top of the lime-soaked avocado slices - DELICIOUS! So good in fact my valentine was hesitant to move on to the next course!",

I also left a lot of the avocoado mixture in and smushed the crab/shrimp mixture into the halves. I would just have to go back to replace the filling I ate. I love avocado and didn't want to waste it. Leaving the avocado gave it an extra boost to the texture and made it more hearty. I also doubled the amount of cucumber which gave it an extra crunch. I ended up eating both halves of the avocado! YUMMY! The mixture is also good on top of crackers and toast! This is an excellent recipe and will become a staple in my cookbook!",

Having had stuffed Avocados often previously I sliced the avocado in half removed the seed and PEELED the skin off. Using the flesh as a \"boat\" placed it on top of lettuce on the plate and filled the halves with seafood mixture. Recommend using the recipe as a guide for your own favorite mixture. Use just enough mayo or cream cheese mixture to hold together but not soupy. Also very good using a tuna or chicken mixture. Add fresh fruit to the plate maybe sliced tomato and a mini muffin or crackers to complete the meal. Often both avocado halves are used per serving with stuffing mix overflowing the avocado haves onto the lettuce on plate. Nice for a luncheon meal. I cook by guess and by golly as my mother would say. Add & leave out as suits you. 5 stars when made as stated in my comments",

Maybe I didn't add enough pepper or I just prefer things with alot of pepper. I'm not sure. I didn't use cucumber so perhaps that's why. Next time I'll cut back on the mayo and add more fresh ground pepper and perhaps a little cayenne. Overall it was good quick and easy.
