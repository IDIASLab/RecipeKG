Most of the breadcrumbs fell off after taking them out of the oven. The gravy was disgusting the chicken broth was so overpowering I had to throw it away the texture was like a paste. The waffle batter was so thick it took an eternity for it to cook all the way through and even then it was still kind of dough like in the middle. I would not recommend this recipe.",
