Ours got mushy and looked funny but we strategically placed them to make them look like some were drunk and fell down. Was hilarious. We made a little bottle out of cucumber! We don't like olives so used Pickles and we did not have dill so used sweet pickles and they were super yummy (from the bite I had before my family ate them all) Next time would do for people coming to my place so they don't get mushy but they rock!",

I prepared the filling as directed (except cut the horseradish to 1/2 tablespoon because kids are eating) and although it tasted good, it was too stiff for us.  I added 2 more tablespoons of mayo and 1 more teaspoon of pickle juice to get it to the consistency we like.  We did like the base recipe though and will have again.",
