However, as a mother of four, I opt for the quick method as I'm sure other parents of small ones can appreciate. The kids really love this dish too. Buon Appetito!",

These are all good fresh flavors and I cooked it perfectly cooking the tomato mixture first then adding the broccoli for about five minutes until tender and vivid green but not overcooked. This was still just tomatoes and broccoli and only average tasting.",

Per other reviewers I added 2T balsamic vinegar and fresh basil to a can of italian diced tomatoes (as that is what I had on hand). I used a little bit more garlic and it was perfect for us. Per another reviewer's suggestion I served it over \"Pasta Hot Hot Hot\" from this site and it was a great meal. Thank you for a very good recipe alternative for broccoli!",
