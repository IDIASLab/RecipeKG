I also use a little (about 1/4 - 1/2 c) red wine (it does darken the color but adds tons to the flavor!). Lastly I saute the onions & fresh garlic and then add fresh mushrooms. Saute all until tender and add to the sauce. Let simmer for a few hours and YUUUM!! You can also add 1-2 lbs ground beef or a mixture of ground beef and italian sausage (very yummy) for a meat sauce! Glad she took the time to write this down tho bc I never do and sometimes I forget what proportions when I try to share the recipe:). Thanks Phyllis!",
