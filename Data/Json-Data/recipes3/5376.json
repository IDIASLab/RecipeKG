Being cooked with the salsa the night before it turned out fabulous! We will definetely be making this again.",

To help the messiness after forming the patty I used a spatula to carry & flip the patties in the egg & bread crumbs. I added a few crumbs to the mix but the patties were still messy though I didn't mind. All in all the patties came out great tasting! I'll try different potatoes & different seasoned crumbs next time for a different flavor. Maybe I'll try a different fish too. I used Italian crumbs & red potatoes this time around. I didn't have any halibut so I used extra salmon.",
