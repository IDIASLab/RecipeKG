I poured roasted red pepper pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan and a little over each one before ladling on the alfredo.

I also added chopped chicken, but the next time I will boil my chicken breast and shred it very fine and it will be much easier to not only roll up, but to eat!",

I just cook the frozen spinach according to package directions, then mix with the ricotta-parm mixture and spread on the noodles. I use a jar of spaghetti sauce as the base, put the noodle rolls down, then cover with more spaghetti sauce. I make a thick mornay sauce to pour over the top, simmering butter, flour, milk, eggs, and (parmesan) cheese until it reaches the desired consistency. this cheese sauce is really the star of the recipe. I would imagine this is still good with bottled Alfredo, but I really like it with the two sauces, and nothing compares to that rich, creamy sauce on top!",

The filling was good after my changes, but the finished dish once I poured the sauce on was not what I was expecting for such a well-reviewed recipe. I used Newman's Own All Natural Alfredo Sauce, so perhaps it was the brand? Either way, the only way I'd make this again would be if I used marinara instead of alfredo. Thanks anyhow!",
