Every time I make it, I use about 1/2 to 3/4 of a bottle of BBQ sauce (and I use hickory instead of honey, because I always buy hickory smoked bacon and when I tried it with the honey BBQ sauce, it was nasty). I usually cook 2 slices of bacon per chicken breast and that's plenty enough. I bake the chicken in the BBQ sauce while cooking the bacon on the stove, and then add the bacon during the last 10 minutes or so of baking.",
