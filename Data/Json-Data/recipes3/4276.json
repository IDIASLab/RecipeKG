First of all you should add a can, or jar of baby WHOLE clams in with the chopped clams. Much more meaty. Secondly, after the garlic has lightly browned deglaze the pan with 1/3 cup dry white wine or dry sherry (NOT the cooking wine stuff). And lastly, Chopped basil has much more flavor than parsley. And another thing. What is this with all complaints of the sauce being \"to runny\"? It's supposed to be runny!! Any Italian, or most anybody who likes this dish knows that you eat it with bread. And you use the bread to sop up the \"runny\" sauce. And don't complain about \"that's to much bread\" because it only takes about two small slices of Italian bread to do the job. If you're gonna do it, do it right.",
