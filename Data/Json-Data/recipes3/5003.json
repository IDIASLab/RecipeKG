I expected more flavor from the recipe but it turned out rather bland. Perhaps the shrimp should be marinated in the coconut milk/jalepeno/tumeric/ginger mixture?",

First when making the spice paste it's helpful to add some liquid (we used a few tablespoons of vegetable oil) so it could actually continue to flow down into the blender instead of just turning into whirling chunks. Next for the coconut milk it's important to get a good brand. We used Asian Family as the milk is already quite thick. Cheaper brands are thin forcing you to cook at a higher temperature for longer and thus risking overcooking the shrimp. Otherwise it turned out great and tasted like a dish you would find in a restaurant!",

If you don't have that, add a little of the coconut milk to your food processor. As far as the criticism of it being \"bland\", try using Thai Chili's or Habanero to taste instead of the Jalapeno, or don't remove the hot seeds and inner flesh when you mash the Jalapeno, (you can mash the chili's to a paste separately and be careful and taste the sauce as it's cooking, these chili's are VERY hot so don't use too much!). Also, you can add a tablespoon or more of Palm Sugar to taste while its cooking. Coconut milk will thicken more the longer you cook it, so if your sauce is soupy, you're not cooking it long enough. Add the shrimp and basil last, once the sauce has thickened.",

I put about a tablespoon of peanut oil in the food processor with the spices so they pureed a bit better. I also substituted cilantro for the basil because that's what was on hand.
