I took the first batch out after 16 min and finished it in a 350 degree oven turned down to 250.  The chicken was done; we like our chicken well done!",

The chicken cooked faster than anticipated (definitely  less than 20 mins) so if you want yours to be as juicy as mine was, make sure you do not over cook. Just make sure you season the meat before coating with batter for more flavor. I used skinless chicken thighs the first time and chicken tenderloins the second. Thanks for the recipe.",

I did as most everyone else & doubled all ingredients as I didn\u2019t think a half cup of flour would go very far. I dropped them in flour first, then egg & then in the bag of flour. They had a great crust. Don\u2019t turn too much or you\u2019ll lose the tasty crust!! Family was pleased!!!",
