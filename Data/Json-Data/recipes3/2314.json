I just added more spices and water until the consistency seemed right to me.  Next time I\u2019ll cut back on the oil and flour.  The trick to a perfect gravy is to always have equal amounts of fat (oil or butter) and flour so be sure to cut both equally.    I also allowed the flour to brown a little before adding the vegetable stock.  I think that really adds to the flavor.  I would say that the nutritional yeast is not necessary, but it helps a lot.  For those who don't know, for some reason nutritional yeast + soy sauce = total goodness.  You see that combination in a lot of vegetarian recipes.  This will definitely be in my recipe box permanently with some doctoring.  I think this recipe would adapt well, like using mushroom broth instead of vegetable.  I\u2019ll definitely try it again.

As a matter-of-fact, we didn't have a lot of things, so I had to make quite a few substitutions. Olive oil for the generic vegetable oil, no nutritional yeast, ordinary soy sauce, portabello mushroom broth for vegetable broth, no salt, and parsley, rather than sage. The result was extremely good, and I was pleasantly surprised. This is the sort of thing you can pull off without much effort, and I'll definitely make it again.",

It had a very good flavor, but after it sat on the table for about 10 minutes, that 1/2 cup of oil all started to pool up at the surface. I wanted to go stir the gravy every five minutes to make sure no one noticed. I think this is a good, sound gravy recipe and is probably an outstanding alternative if you're a vegetarian, but if you're not, take my advice: substitute the 1/2 cup of oil with the same amount of butter, and if you prefer, use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. It will taste - and look - a lot better.",

My mom and I have searched for years for a gravy that could stand up to the fat & meat based fare at Thanksgiving and this recipe definitely does it. Even the meat eaters at the table were impressed and asked for seconds! I added about 2/3 c. mushrooms which I cooked with onions and garlic (this means that it needed to cook for several extra minutes to cook off some of the water released from the mushrooms). Wonderful gravy--most definitely a part of my permanent file.",

Definitely cut these two ingredients or you will have a very very thick gravy. I think it was the soy sauce that I did not care for. Next time I try this I am going to eliminate the soy sauce and try some other spices like poultry seasoning. I think it can be worked into something I like but not as is. Sorry.",
