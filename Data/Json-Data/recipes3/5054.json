The only problem I had was with getting the \"crunchy\" stuff to be crunchy...I baked it in a glass baking dish first and then moved it into a bigger shallower dish and spread it out and baked it a bit more until it looked more golden in color. After it cooled a bit I broke it into smaller pieces to cool a little more...any suggestions would be great!",
