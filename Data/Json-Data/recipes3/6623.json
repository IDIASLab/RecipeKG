An excellent way to use up extra spaghetti sauce. We used mozzarella sticks and Prego sauce. Everyone enjoyed it including my 3-year-old. Definitely recommend this one!",

I did saute 8oz. sliced mushrooms with the onion because they needed to be used up and they ended up being a great addition. I used marinated artichokes which provided an exrta layer of flavor and yumminess and added more cheese than called for. This is a VERY filling sandwich but one I will most certainly be making again!
