I sauted them first before I added them.  I also used diced green onion and red pepper for flavor and color.  I replaced the cream of mushroom soup with Cream of Shrimp soup.  Not all grocery stored carry it but you can find it.  It gives the lasagna more of a seafood taste.  If you have a small family this recipe is easy to cut in half.  Delicious!!!!! Leslie",

The only thing I had against it was that the prep time was more than planned... and the sauce was a little watery. But I refrigerated the lasagna over night and the next day I heated it up it was GREAT!!!!!! I guess because it was refridgerated the sauce thickened and it was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I recommend cooking and drying all seafoods and veggies used to prevent them from producing more water as the lasagna bakes. I added 2 eggs but was still runny. Perhaps I would also cut down on the canned soup by 1/2 cup and increase the cheese mixture by 1 cup. It was my first time to make lasagna and it looked like goulash but the taste alone was 5 stars.",

It certainly takes me longer than that from start to finish. I assume the 5 is a typo. It certainly is tasty though and even my \"picky\" hubby loves it. Since my children are grown I only cook for two. This recipe makes enough for 6-8 meals so I freeze leftovers. It freezes beautifully and is just as good when thrown in the microwave. I work fulltime (11 hour days) and don't want to do too much in the kitchen so make this on my days off. Superb! I make it often.",

I cooked more noodles (15 instead of 8) and layered five of each in three layers). I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage and the flavor was delightful. Next time I might try cottage and put it through the blender to obtain the same consistenty as the ricotta was quite expensive in comparison. I used shrimp scallops and imitation crab (flaked pollock) and increased the number of eggs to \"2\" to better hold the cheese mixture together. I omitted to wine and used a very sparse amount of milk. I would definately recommend baking this the night before and re-heating. I failed to do this and kicked myself the next day when I heated up leftovers. Definately a 5 star recipe!!! YUM YUM!!",
