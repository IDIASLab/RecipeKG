While it is certainly less time consuming to buy Jalapeno Powder if you are feeling particularly adventureous you can make your own if you have an abundance of peppers in your garden. Cut jalapenos in half or quarters and seed so they will dry faster and more evenly. Place in one layer on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Bake at 200 degrees 1-3 hours removing those that become dry so they don t burn. When cooled grind the peppers in a blender or food processor to make jalapeno powder. Store in an air-tight jar. (Wear gloves while handling peppers and be careful not to breathe in the jalapeno pepper dust when grinding).",
