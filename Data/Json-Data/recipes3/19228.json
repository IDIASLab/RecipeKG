But not a 5 star recipe due to so many changes needed. 1st, if you're not going to use bone-in chicken then don't complain if you end up with a dish that's just \"okay\". Half the flavor of any dish calling for bone-in chicken comes from the bones. I did this: bought a chicken cut up from the grocery & removed skin, sprinkled w/ kosher salt, pepper, & paprika before browning. For sauce I added 3 cloves of garlic minced; 1 & 1/2 cup wine, 2 8oz boxes chicken broth, 1 & 1/2 cups water mixed with chicken stock base, 1 cup fat free sour cream, 1 tbspn Olivio (butter sub). Put LOADS more paprika in than called for, both Hungarian paprika & HOT Hungarian paprika (probably 1/4 cup paprika total). Added more salt & pepper. When chicken was done, I removed, de-boned & returned to pan after letting the liquid cook down to 1/2. Still had several cups of liquid & would NEVER recommend reducing to what this recipe says. Mixed a few tablespoons of flour with the liquid from the pan & added to sauce to thicken. Served over noodles. STELLAR! Restaurant quality! Company worthy!",

HUNGARIAN paprika must be used to get the true taste, or bland is an understatement.  I also would never use boneless/skinless chicken breasts (to decrease cooking time as some have done) because the skin and cooking time is essential to meld the final flavor of \"paprikas\" (the Hungarian spelling of what is pronounced \"paprikash\").  Overall, this is the only recipe that I've ever had that can compare to the family recipe.",

The sauce you are to make at the very end from drippings will require a lot more than is suggested in the recipe. You will need to add more wine more paprika more oil. Also you will probably need to add a more salt and pepper than you would think. Other than that everything should be very delicious.",
