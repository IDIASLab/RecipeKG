I forgot to defrost the hash browns (it was Christmas Eve!) and I used O'brien potatoes with the peppers and onions already in them. Even though the potatoes were still frozen this cooked very well. This recipe is also so versatile that you can add any seasoning to your family's taste I added garlic because that is what my family loves!

I also omitted the ground mustard and added several dashes of curry powder to the eggs. To make the eggs a bit fluffier I used a 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup water instead of the 1 cup of milk. I reserved a third of the cheese to melt on top when the dish was done. It was very moist and flavorful! This is a great base recipe that can be made to taste with vegetables meat and seasonings of your choosing. This is the first time I made a breakfast casserole in the crock pot and I am very pleased with the result. It took 5 hours on low in my oblong crockpot.",
