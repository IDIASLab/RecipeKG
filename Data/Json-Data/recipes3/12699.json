Great way to get protein and veggies together. I used quinoa flour instead of rice flour the second time and it was the same taste. I also add a pinch of baking powder to the mix.  I don\u2019t think the feta cheese adds much inside the pancake but crumbled on top with tomatoes and cucumbers it\u2019s really good. Also tried frying it in EVOO, ghee and nothing (in a nonstick pan) and found it cooks most evenly browned in the nonstick pan with no oil. This is going to be a staple for me as a double batch makes 18 x 5 inch pancakes which make for an easy, healthy breakfast or even lunch or dinner with salad.",
