I didn't have a crown roast but did have two fresh pork tenderloins and was looking for an alternative to honey Dijon which always seems to be my pork go-to glaze. I made this glaze as instructed but added the zest of 1/2 of the lime and a splash of balsamic vinegar (only because I love the stuff so much I'd eat it over cereal). I allowed it to reduce a bit on the stove until syrupy then let it cool. I put the tenderloins on the BBQ rotisserie and once 1/2 way through cooking I basted them every 10 minutes as instructed and OMG DELISH!! Served with a chop salad and grilled plums with balsamic (again!) glaze. I'm going to double this recipe next time and use it on a lamb shoulder on the BBQ rotisserie. Thanks JAYDA. Great recipe!",
