First, toss some powdered sugar in the bag, close it up and shake the heck out of it. This coats the sides which will make things stick less. Dump in the chocolately chex, add some powdered sugar, close the bag up (trapping air in it) and shake it again. Keep adding more powdered sugar until each piece stays separated and is the sweetness you want. Cleanup is a snap. Just toss the bag.",

I did make and error and pick up the 12 oz box of cereal instead of the 17 1/2 oz box and found that I did not need the entire pound of powdered sugar....but might have needed it if I had the larger box of cereal. I used a store brand of Rice Chex and it tasted great. Didn't really need the name brand for this. Will definitely make this again. I can see it very popular at kid parties or to put in snack bags as treats for Halloween parties with a card stock tag shaped like a bone with \"PUPPY CHOW\" written on it.\r\n",

I reduced the icing sugar because it was really really sweet so mine turned out kinda greyish brown? Does it mean I need more icing sugar? I used margarine instead of butter and don't know if it makes a difference. They are delicious though, what ever color you get. The worst part about this recipe is that you cannot get Chex cereals in western Canada easily. I used Kellogg's crisp X. It worked great. Excuse me, I have to get back to my snack now....",
