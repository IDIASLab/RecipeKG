To ease preparations I skipped all the steps about sauteing a little at a time - I just put all the veggies into a big roasting pan and sauteed them all at once until the cabbage had wilted then put the roast (unbrowned) on top of the veggies and slid it into the oven. It was awesome - I'll definitely make this again.",
