It offers a tasty healthy twist on the old standby of mac and cheese. I followed the recipe exactly and it got very good reviews in our house. When I reheated the leftovers I sprinkled a little more cheddar cheese on top and that seemed to make it even better. I also think it would benefit from having some cheese layered inside the macaroni... but that may just be nitpicking. If you're undecided about whether to try this or not do it. It probably won't become your signature dish but everyone will enjoy it.",
