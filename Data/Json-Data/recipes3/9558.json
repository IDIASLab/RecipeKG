To those of you who \"burned on outside, pink in middle, you could of done a number of things either \"flame to high, crowed your pieces, or did not make sure pieces were of the same uniform size. Also, make sure oli is hot enough before placing piecec in...Any GOOD quality deep fry pan, will work. Do NOT fill oil more than one inch. Make sure \"one side is completely browned and crispy \"before turning over. Do not \"over turn.\nYou must use the buttermilk to get it tender and juicy. It \"does not change or alter the flavor in any way:)..I do cook at approx.370...350 is not hot enough to get that \"instant crisp.\" after about 5 minutes that \"seals the juices\".Take your time. Never be in a hurry when making this.You can change up the spices you use. Sometimes I use Italian spice mix, with added garlic powder(yum) and then other times I make it spicy with garlic powder/salt pepper to taste.MAKE SURE to drain on paper towels or you'll get \"wet coating\". Do this EVERY time you fry anything. Never skip o the \"little details when you cook. Enjoy! I get requests for my old fashion Southern fried chicken ALL the time. Its TOTALLY different than the \" you get in restrurants:)",

A few pieces came out pretty good but many of them were burnt outside/undercooked inside. I wouldn't try it again without a fryer. At least I went the easier route and used all chicken legs.",
