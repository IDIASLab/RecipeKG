I probably doubled the onion added two cloves of garlic and used my homemade vegetable stock. I hate when I'm rolling through a recipe only to find I'm missing key ingredients but subbing sweet potato for red potato worked beautifully and instead of barley I had about 1/2 cup of red lentils to use up. Love the tarragon aroma and flavor - used the full 2 tbsp and it was perfect. Can't wait for the next turkey dinner so I can try this with chopped cooked turkey instead of ground!",
