Keep stirring it and breaking it up.  Use the cheap smaller hamburger buns from the store and (my personal preference) mustard and onions.  I will miss the tiny little always crammed counter in Iowa - now, if I could just duplicate those pies...OMG that woman can bake a pie!",

I saw this on the AR exchange and had to try it after watching numerouse re-runs of \"Rosanne\" and the \"Landford Lunchbox\" featuring this famous sandwich. I added the 1/4 cup of onion to the drained meat. I made my own broth out of beef base for less sodium and used lean beef. I ended up with quite a lot of broth but used a slotted spoon and a teaspoon or so on the sandwich was good anyway. I served with hamburger dills pickles and mustard as suggested. They are a must! I did use the small buns also as recommended but regular sized ones would have been better to hold the meat in more likely. Not a repeat recipe but still interesting to try!",
