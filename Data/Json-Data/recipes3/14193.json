The side got a little over cooked which made the Brussels a little bitter and the apple was mushy and tasteless. The pancetta was also a little too crispy. I didn t leave the side in the oven as long as the chicken. I took it out after 30 minutes but probably should have taken it out after 20. I like the concept. Perhaps another time I ll start the meat first and add the side at the half way mark.",
