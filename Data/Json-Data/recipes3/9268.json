I personally found it too much raw garlic...but I still had seconds :) I couldn't find a 16 oz package of pasta so I got two 9 oz packages, and it was waaaay too much; I put about 1/3 aside for another meal. The portions are very generous, think this could easily be 6 main dish servings. Thanks so much for the recipe, JJLuke!",
