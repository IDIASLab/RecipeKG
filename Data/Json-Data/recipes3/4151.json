To help out some of the folks who is saying that the stuffing is dry do not drain the fat when you brown the ground meat.  This is what makes it moist.  If you do not want the fat included then you must substitute with another liquid (i.e., beef broth) before adding the stuffing mix.  Remember to slowly add the amount of stuffing mix for the texture or consistency you prefer your stuffing to be.  I hope this helps!",

To fix the dryness, try a few of these (you don't need to do them all):  boil the prepared pepper halves for 2 or 3 min first, and let them dry while you prepare the rest (this prevents them from simply being sponges).  Second, leave out the file -- THAT is a sponge, and adds little flavor anyway.  Third, I mixed in about 3/4 can of Campbell's Tomato Soup (condensed) into the mix before stuffing (you could also use a small can of Zesty V8).  Fourth, if you place the halves in a 9x13 dish to bake, just add about a half inch of water to the bottom of the pan -- that keeps things moist.  I used options three and four, and loved it.

I reread the recipe and there is no liquid at all to bind the stuffing mixture together ie chicken broth eggs etc. Next time I will add some liquid. Also it would be great with a creole cream sauce or a spicy tomato sauce as a base. It is definitely worth another try. Thanks.",

I used cornbread stuffing...just what was in the cupboard and halved red peppers to stuff...topped with shredded cheddar and the bread crumbs. Oh and I added beef stock to the stuffing for moisture.....it was soooooooo good! I served it as a side to Creolized Stuffed Chicken Breasts...a recipe on this site that I highly recommend.",

I also used very lean ground beef and Italian Sausage (50-50)The sausage comes in reg mild and spicy. I used spicy. I also cut the tops off the peppers at an angle close to the stem remove the seed pod and when I finish stuffing the pepper I take a slice of cheese and seal the hole just under the edges of the hole. Then I replace the top and cook. The cheese keeps the juices and mix in the pepper and adds a little flavor as well. It also makes for a plesant presentation. I also cooked them on the stove top making a little more sauce to set them in and cover the pot until done. place the pepper in the middle of a plate pour sauce over the top. Enjoy.",

I added rice (as we always do in my region for stuffed peppers) extra garlic a little tomato sauce a little chicken stock (didn't have beef) and a lil extra bread crumbs (as I didn't have bread stuffing to start with). I took others' advice and blached them ahead of time then topped them before baking with a sprinkle of bread crumbs and some cheddar cheese crumbles. The family liked it but I wasn't very impressed.",
