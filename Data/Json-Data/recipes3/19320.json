I used leftover roasted turkey in place of chicken in lieu of seperate cans of veggies I used veg-all also I didn't have plain stuffing crumbs so I used a box of stove-top if you were making the whole recipe you would need 2 boxes. I wonder if you would really need to cook the chicken first since you bake it for over an hour? I served it with green beans and cranberry sauce my family enjoyed this recipe thanks for submitting it.",

My father in-law is not a mushroom fan so I did the following substitutions: Cream of Celery soup instead of Cream of Mushroom soup and used a can of cut asparagus tips drained instead of the fresh mushrooms. Next time I will use 2 cans of the asparagus (one for the bottom layer and the other for the top). I also used a can of roasted garlic chicken broth in lieu of the regular can. I used light sour cream and will try light mayo next time. Overall this was a clear winner at my dinner table. Left-overs taste just as good if not better than the first go around. Thanks for this great recipe Janet!",
