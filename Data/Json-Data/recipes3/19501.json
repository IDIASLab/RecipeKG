I read most of the reviews so this is what I did that I believe made my attempt a success: I sifted my flour like it says--some people were complaining about there being too much flour in it making it crumbly -- if you don't sift it, you do get more flour than intended because it is more compacted.  I handled the dough as little as possible--mix it just enough to get the balls to form--it should look marbled, a good sign for flakiness.  After letting it chill (I did that while making the apple filling) I wet a washcloth and wiped my counter, then I put down a couple sheets of plastic wrap so they'd stick tight to the counter.  Then I unwrapped the dough and placed it on the covered counter and put another sheet of plastic wrap on top of it and I rolled it out like that--a plastic wrap sandwich.  It rolled out very quickly, with no turning, and neatly as there was absolutely no messing with flour which could make this crust too dry again. Once rolled out very thin, you simply remove the top plastic wrap and handle the crust gently by lifting up the bottom layer of plastic wrap and placing the crust carefully in your pan. This is a delicate crust, so measure and place carefully.  But, it looked, held-up and tasted great so I gave it 5 stars.  Thanks!",

Now the reality is that things made with high fat such as shortening, etc. do taste the best to the tastebuds, but if you are into healthy eating, this is the piecrust for you. You can have your pie and eat it too. To me, for a healthy crust, this is absolutely delicious. This will be my new piecrust for all of the pies that I bake. Used olive oil for extra health benefits. Finally, to be able to eat pie without feeling weighed down.  Thanks so Much for this healthy variety piecrust. It is great!!!!!!",

I did add some savory and a little basil to the crust since it was not for a sweet pie. I also used olive oil for it's health benefits and rolled the crust out thinly between 2 sheets of waxed paper.
