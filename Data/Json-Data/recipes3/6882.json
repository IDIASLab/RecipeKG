I made these burgers tonight and like one of the other reviewers I had no chipotle peppers but I did have the spice available. Unfortunately I had no idea how much to substitute for the chipotle pepper and ended up adding waaaaayyy too much spice to my burgers. They were blazing hot! I used 1 teaspoon of spice to 1 1/4 pound of ground sirloin (for four servings). So if anyone suggests a substitution please also suggest a quantity to use. I know I would really appreciate the help and maybe others would too. I enjoyed the burgers and I will give them another shot with either real chipotles or lower the amount of spice I use.",

The more I read the reviews I realized that these would be at their peak from grilling. So we had the burgers minus the buns and cheese. We got to taste the true flavor. Very very tasty. I might use a teeny bit less chipotles in adobo next time. My word on that ingredient is this-buy a small can put the remainder in an airtight container and keep it in the frig. I have been using the same container for about 6 months. Believe me it keeps its flavor and kick! And there's not really any great substitute when a recipe calls for it. One question for the others- what did they use as \"grill seasoning?\" I don't have any on hand as we do most of our own combinations to make rubs etc. I just used some paprika chili powder and smoked salt. We really loved these. This recipe elevates burgers to \"company\" status. Yum.",

It too was pretty darned good! The smokiness and heat of the chipotles combined with the liquid smoke is quite a tasty combo. I really like your recipe. Thanks!
