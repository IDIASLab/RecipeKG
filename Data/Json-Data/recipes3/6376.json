Hubby liked it my kids were harder to please on this dish...but the one thing they agreed on was they didn't care for the bread crumbs. Maybe use a lot less then a whole cup. And maybe Panko bread crumbs. The bread crumbs could have soaked up too much of the creamyness to this dish. 1/2 cup or less probably would have been fine. And the kids didn't care for the kielbosa in it either...which I found to be strange because they love kielbosa. I thought it had a nice flavor overall but agreed to much bread crumbs. If the kielbosa would have been left out I feel they would have enjoyed it better. One child who will eat almost anything said it tasted funny and doesn't want me to make it again...Hubby wants it again. So this review on rating it has been very difficult. I will say I'll attempt it again with some different modifications to see if it suits everyone.",
