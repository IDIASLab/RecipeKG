Serve with brown mustard on substantial hoagie rolls, never on hot dog buns. Mustard is important and must always be stone ground. Add warm sauerkraut and ketchup, if you like. Chow down!

                "reviewBody": "Hubby would probably only rate this as 3-star as he is a bratwurst purist and prefers his brats slow-grilled without parboiling. Occasionally he'll agree to having this brats and beer method, which I just love. As Wisconsinites we know it's a continued debate as to which way is best. No matter which method, we also know brats to be included in nearly everyone's backyard cook-outs or Green Bay Packers or Milwaukee Brewers tailgates. You can smell it in the air! That said, don't poke the brats! Why would you do that?  Also, as for keeping them on hold in a slow cooker, I see this done frequently, particularly at large gatherings, but be forewarned that the beer taste intensifies this way, kind of killing that good bratwurst flavor and softens them, taking away that juicy crunch (from the browned casing) when you bite into them. For those of you living in regions of the country where brats are not available, our Usinger's brand is WONDERFUL and can be ordered online at www.usingers.com. Good, sturdy brat buns, if you can find them in your area, are a must!",

I also did not poke holes in them, other than that I followed the recipe.  After cooking the brats in the beer mixture I strained the onions and saut\u00e9ed them further and then added them to a cola sauerkraut recipe found on this site.  That evening my husband grilled the brats and could not stop eating them, I was afraid I would not have any left for the party the next day. He kept on saying that I must have used some very good brats!   After they were grilled I cut them in half and mixed them in the cola sauerkraut.  The night of the party I warmed the mixture in the microwave and the kept it warm in a chafing dish. I served fresh Italian bread cut to the size of the mini brats for those wanting to eat it on a bun.   The moral of my story is the 4-month-old brats that I wanted to get rid of, turned out to be the hit of the party.  I was asked over and over who made the brats.  Thanks for a good recipe, I am sure I will make this many times over, I might even buy some high quality fresh brats!\n\nthis was the other dish I made http://sidedish.allrecipes.com/az/ClSrkrt.asp",

A couple tablespoons of butter is optional and acceptable. Finish on a medium hot charcoal grill just before serving...with Silver Springs Beer and Brat Horseradish Mustard.

Since some of the kids requested brats instead of hamburgers and hot dogs I decided to try this recipe. We had 177 kids attend ranging from age 6 to 14 years show up for the party and the brats were gone in 15 minutes. I wasn't sure how many would be ate so I only made 50 I wish I had made more. I threw them in my electric roaster with one pound of butter and eight finely sliced onions and a 12 pack of Milwaukees Best beer. I DID NOT POKE HOLES IN THE BRATS. I cooked on 300 for two hours. Then we grilled them and the kids many who hadn't had brats loved them along with our volunteer parents. The grilled onions were also great but many of the kids wouldn't try them but the ones who did along with the parents loved them. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe. I will use this one for now on.",
