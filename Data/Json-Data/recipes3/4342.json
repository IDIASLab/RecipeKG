I reduced it to 1/4 to 1/2 cup and add a little chicken broth if it needs to be more moist.  Try using wide egg noodles instead of the farfalle, a freshly ground coarse black pepper. Combine cabbage and noodles in the pan and cook together for a few minutes to blend flavors. This was a frequent, Friday-night, vegetarian supper.  Thanks for the memories!",

Being Italian American, I grew up having a bowl of pasta with butter, and a little salt & pepper, so I am always looking for pasta dishes.  I used it as the recipe suggested, but used whole wheat pasta shells, and only 1/2 of a 13 oz package.  I used minced onion, and garlic salt instead of the garlic and onion, and added a little salt & pepper.  Also, I like my cabbage crisp tender, so cooking for only 7 minutes was enough for me.  The butter paired really well with the pasta and cabbage.  I also love parmesean cheese with pasta, and added a little to my dish before serving.  Cheese is a little salty, so you might want to use very little salt in the cabbage.  Also, this is a quick dish, I had it ready in 35 minutes, and served it with nothing else, but some hot pull apart rolls.....Delicious!",
