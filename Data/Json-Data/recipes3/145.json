I found the dough hard to work with when I had just made it so I chilled the rolled-out rectangles in the fridge for about an hour before cutting them into strips and arranging them in the right pattern. That way the squares had crisp edges. Then I did an egg-wash and chilled the dough overnight before baking. I substituted hot cocoa mix for the cocoa powder and it worked fine.",

I wanted to make something interesting for my husband's work and found the dough was not only crumbly when you tried to work with it after following the directions exactly it was also a little tough. the flavor however was fine I just prefer cookies that don't take forever to make and actually hold together. Also when the chocolate was added the dough got even drier. The cookie took on a misshapen appearance while baking where the \"vanilla\" part got puffier than the chocolate and they kind of made \"kite\" shapes.",

Now that I live on my own with my boyfriend it was my turn to make them myself this year!

I recommend that method to those who complained about the difficult of rolling out the dough. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
