This is the first one that I've ever used that didn't contain any sugar and also the first that used wine in a substantial quantity. I brined my 9 pound turkey for 12 hours and then I rinsed it and moved the bird to a rack to dry and put in my fridge uncovered for another 18 hours. This will ensure that you get a crisp skin. The end result was a juicy flavorful bird that was excellent in taste and texture. I did not stuff my bird but I feel that this recipe would not have altered the flavor of the stuffing significantly and I think you could do that if you wanted. I did not detect a wine taste at all just a flavorful juicy bird. Thank you for a great recipe.",
