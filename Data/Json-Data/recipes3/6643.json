To solve this problem and make them perfect I first set the ramekin with the butter and cream only in simmering water.  When the cream is hot, I break the eggs into it and put just a little cream on top of the eggs with the cheese.  Then I place in the oven.  This process helps to cook the eggs evenly and gets them just right.  Hope this helps anyone who has had the same problem I've had.",

I used 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of cream (well, sour cream as I don't have cream) then just sprinkled on salt, pepper, chives, and the parmesan.  Didn't even measure those.  Mine took longer than 12-15 min to bake--more like 20, and I had the oven on higher bc I was preheating for a bread I'm making.  Otherwise, delicious and easy.  A good way to make sunny side up eggs without frying.  Served with pita bread and it was great.  Could easily be made for a number of people using muffin tins.",

I really liked how easy it was to make all those eggs and everyone gets to eat at the same time warm eggs. definately doing again next time using chives and parmesan.",
