I used 1 cup of fresh spinach that I roughly chopped in place of the frozen spinach. I also upped the amount of spices, because I really enjoy a strong spice flavor--so I used 1 1/2 tsps cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, plus the addition of 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 allspice. To up the flavor even a bit more, I added 1 1/2 tsps vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp salt. They were perfect! I really like that they aren't super sweet, but still really flavorful. This only made 15 muffins for me, and that was with filling the muffin cups pretty full. I think stretching it to 24 standard size muffins would make pretty small muffins. Next time, I'm going to try mixing in some raisins and walnuts to make these over-the-top delicious! Thank you for the recipe--I'll be making these again!",

The second time I made the recipe I added more spinach and they were tasty but a bit too wet even though I extracted as much water as I did the first time. Next time I'll probably only loosely pack a cup's worth of spinach. I'll also cook these 25-30 mins. Finally they remain pretty dense so you can get away with filling the cups more than 2/3 of the way. My 15 mo. old twins couldn't get enough of these and I liked them as well.",
