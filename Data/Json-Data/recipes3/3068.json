They took a little longer to bake, about 30 minutes. I used green onion instead of yellow onion and added about 2 tbsps of salsa instead of the chile peppers. I added a splash of hot sauce too. These would probably be even better with some cheese sprinkled on top!.. Gotta try that next time!!",

I had a little left over after I filled the muffin tins but I just scrambled them up and fed them to my husband.  It was delicious!",

I ended up leaving out the onion only because I figured that I had added onion powder and didn't want to cut up an onion just to use a little anyhow. I've made scrambled egg muffins before so I knew to grease the heckfire out of my tins before adding the egg mixture. To make it easier I evenly portioned the cooked turkey meat into the six muffin tins then poured the egg mix over each individual portion. This was really easy and well loved by all of us. Next time I might add chopped ham and shredded cheese or do all chopped vegetables. GREAT kid pleaser.",
