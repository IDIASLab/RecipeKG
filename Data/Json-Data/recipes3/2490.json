And I did not roll the dough I just made it into balls and flattened them with my hands. I used ground ginger instead of ginger roots. It came out VERY delicious crunchy at the bottom but soft inside. Thank you very much for this recipe. I will use it with different spices and flavors in the future.",

Maybe with a little crushed up peppermint candy in the batter to give it a holiday flair.",
