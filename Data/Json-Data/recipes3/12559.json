Also sprinkled breadcrumbs on top and broiled it at the end for about 3 mins to add a crispy crunchy top - it was a hit!",

Next time I will double the cheese sauce ingredients for a full size casserole or only use half the amount of elbow Mac for a half casserole size. I do think this recipe will be smooth and creamy with the right Mac mix. The cheese sauce method is great to use with many other recipes also.",
