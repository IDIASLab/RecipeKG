The flavors blended to perfection.  I used tomato basil feta.  Magnifique!  My only suggestion is to roast the vegetables slightly before topping the pizza because the juice of so much pepper and onion can cause the dough at center of the pizza to be slightly soggy.  The only alteration I made was adding fresh diced tomato.  I also rubbed a tablespoon of pure olive oil on the dough, sprinkled it with fresh basil and red pepper flakes, which added a brilliant punch!  We will incorporate this into our menu for sure!",
