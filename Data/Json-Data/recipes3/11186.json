Filled the dough with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese (could have added other toppings but this was all we wanted). Rolled one end of the  dough over the toppings, similar to rolling a burrito, then pinched the ends closed. Moved the pizza roll (with the seam down) onto a baking sheet already lined with parchment paper . Brushed the lightly scrambled egg on top of the dough, cut approximately 8 -  2\" slits on the top and then baked as noted. I made 2 of these and both turned out with the perfect golden, brown color. I cut them into about 1 1/2\" slices. My guests dipped them in the pizza sauce that was heated and kept warm in a small slow cooker. It didn't take anytime for all these to disappear and it did not seem to matter that they cooled to room temperature. Everyone loved these and I'll definitely make them again. It was so quick and easy!",
