The only chicken he liked prior to this was in nugget form. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. As I said, it smelled great, looked pretty and tasted wonderful. Never thought of using cranberries for anything but cranberry sauce. Served it with corn bread muffins and buttered asparagus. This will be the way I bake chicken from now on. I am really thinking about trying the sauce on ribs. YUMMY!",
