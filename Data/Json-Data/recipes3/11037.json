I did not add any additional salt after I added the celery salt because cottage cheese does tend to be a little salty. This was surprizingly good. Of course I liked it but I was more surprized that my husband and kids liked it, too. I would make this again. NOTE: I used 4% milkfat cottage cheese.",

Celery salt or some fresh dill or other fresh herbs would have added more flavor too. I couldn't make it creamier but that is because of the cottage cheese I used perhaps. It is definitely worth making but be aware that it needs more flavor. I did like the idea of this recipe! Thanks Jenn!",
