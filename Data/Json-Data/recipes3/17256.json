My creole seasoning (Tony Cachere\u2019s) is nicely spicy and salty, so omitted the red pepper and salt. Potatoes only needed 8 minutes on boil before adding the corn. At the end, set the raw shrimp on top of hot veggies so I could see that they were done. Will definitely make this again since my hubby loved it as much as I did. May add more shrimp. Would go well with a good bread and a salad with oranges, red onions and avocado. Thanks Ashley!",

Some how allrecipes analytics must have figured that out and emailed me this great recipe.  It's like a shrimp boil, but even better (to me)  I spiced it up more than recommended.  I'm not sure why but the amount produced was much more than expected.  It will be at least two full meals for a family of 4 or 4.  The timing on the baking was amazingly on target.  I got polish sausage instead, and a different type of potato and it was DELISH. I wish I could post the photo here.",

I used red potatoes and could have cut back on cooking time a couple of minutes. Family loved it.  Also, I used regular beef (Pre-cooked) beef sausage and it was fine.
