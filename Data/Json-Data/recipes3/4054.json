Just made them and I am really pleased with how they puffed, the texture, color...however even with onion and garlic they really lack something. So, as I have pondered away, I am thinking of trying them again with grated Parmesan, possibly fresh cut corn, something to give it some more flavor...not certain what spices I would want to add to kick it up...don't want them hot as that is not to our liking....tho some might appreciate that. Some kind of dipping sauce, an Aoli of some kind might be nice.  For now I would definitely say try these, but keep in mind they are really bland as written, so use your imagination....",

                "reviewBody": "I am totally impressed with these. They were tremendously fluffy and light, with a mild flavor.  I had to use up some rather too-large yellow squash, so I seeded and peeled them before grating. The baking mix I had wasn't 'buttermilk', it was the regular kind (a heart-healthy version, though).  I ended up just frying them in my regular deep fryer rather than using a pan, and they turned into fritters sort of like a hush puppy but without the cornmeal.  Of course they made far too many for my family, so we will end up baking them to reheat them and recrisp them tomorrow.  I used an ice cream disher to portion the batter. These did like hush puppies should, they turned themselves over when they were ready to flip. I would caution against overcooking, as they will get greasy if you leave them in the oil too long. I did mine for about 3 minutes at 350F, and that might have been a touch long, though they were still moist inside.  Hubby really loved these. My 5 year old daughter ate one and liked it.  Definitely going to use this one again, perhaps with some herbs next time to go with the garlic and onion. Cheese might be good too, but might make them greasier. I expect you could use egg whites instead of whole eggs to lighten them a little more.  Really a great, simple recipe. Thank you!",

While I was making them I opened my fridge for something and saw mushrooms, and had an idea, to coat the mushrooms in the batter then fry them.  They were YUMMY!  Then I did the same with broccoli and green beans, sort of like tempura.  Delicious!  So this recipe can work by itself for the puff or as a tempura type batter.  Thanks for posting it!  :)",
