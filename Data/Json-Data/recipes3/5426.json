I increased the garlic by 2 cloves. Then, as per other readers, I lightly steamed the broccoli -- for 4 minutes -- and poured the mixture over the broccoli. I added some cubed, (boiled) tofu and put that in the fridge to marinate for 3 hours. I served it over brown rice. This dish is fan-freakin-tastic!",
