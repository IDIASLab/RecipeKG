There is a reason they call it fried green tomatoes as the red one was mushy, I sure won't try that again. I have an over abundant supply of tomatoes and decided to try something different. I made the recipe exactly as written. You won't go wrong with this recipe. Loved, loved, loved it!",

I used Bolthouse farm Greek yogurt ranch dressing but that was my only concession to healthier eating. I also didn't use a deep fryer just flipped them in oil not floating but they were still amazing. I've tried other recipies but this is the one I saved and will pass on.
