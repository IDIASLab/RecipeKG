As a Southern girl who knows a thing or two about grits, I recommend you use real cheese, a dash of garlic, and some cayenne for your grits...cook them really low and keep adding water and/or milk until you get a nice, smooth consistency. I don't really modify the shrimp portion of the recipe, except for adding a little extra garlic and some turkey sausage (since shrimp is so expensive). I make this weekly and my family loves it!  ",

I did use my homemade chicken broth in lieu of water, and added some half and half to get them extra creamy. I couldn't find a garlic cheese, so used Monterey Jack and a bit of cheddar. I grated the cheese so it would melt better. I also used canned tomatoes since the market didn't have any good tomatoes and it turned out just fine. I did add some green onions and fresh garden parsley, and seasoned the shrimp with Old Bay, paprika, and a dash of cayenne and of course the fresh minced garlic. This was just so darn delicious. So creamy and cheesy and shrimpy...how can you go wrong. Mine was even better than the restaurant's. Thanks AWEAVER.",
