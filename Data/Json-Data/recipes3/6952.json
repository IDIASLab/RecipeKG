I made the following changes only out of necessity because I think this recipe is perfect by itself: --added an extra banana (it was going to spoil soon) --decreased syrup to 3/4 cup (used sugar free syrup because it's all I had) --decreased sugar to 1/4 cup --didn't have nutmeg allspice or cloves so I just added extra ginger and cinnamon. I poured the batter into a 6-muffin pan and a square baking pan and baked the muffins for 20 minutes and the square pan for 30 minutes. Silicon baking pans are great for this--don't have to grease anything and they come out so easily! ---Update---I made these again the same way except I added the cloves and nutmeg this time and tried decreasing the syrup to 1/2 cup and discovered that I prefer using only ginger and cinnamon and that 3/4 cup syrup is needed to make it sweet enough.",
