I love food with ube flavor thus incorporating it with my favorite breakfast bread. I know there are many pan de sal recipes online but hope you give this a try and let me know what you think. Thank you! Serve hot with or without spread/butter of your choice. For leftovers, warm in a toaster oven before serving for better taste.",
