The lemon, garlic, and dill was the perfect flavoring for the salmon.  I had never heard of using a cedar plank to grill meat, but I absolutely recommend it especially if you have a gas grill (which does not give the meat as much flavor as a charcoal grill. The cedar plank gave it a slightly smoky flavor.  The salmon was wonderful and I will definitely make it again.\n\nJust a few things I learned--I would recommend getting the \"wild\" salmon from Whole Foods--especially for people that typically do not like seafood.  It is a little more expensive, but it is worth it.  The salmon was very fresh and not \"fishy\" smelling, and in addition Whole Foods have quality meat there without additives or growth hormone.  The plank was very easy to work with(thanks to the reviewer who said they got an untreated cedar plank at Home Depot). I soaked it in water for about 4 hours (make sure to get a brick to hold the plank down--I used a pot and the plank kept going up to the surface.)  It took a little bit longer to cook than the recipe said--about 35 minutes. It is hard to tell by the color that the salmon is done, so the meat thermometer is essential.  When the salmon got to 130 F it was perfect (medium).  Hope this helps, you won't be disappointed with the results!",

Soaked it in water for about 4 hours, laid it on the gas grill for 10 minutes at high heat, placed a beautiful Alaskan Copper River sockeye salmon filet on the plank, with the sauce, on the grill at low heat for 25-30 minutes, and it came out utterly moist and SO tender and delicious!  Definitely company-worthy. (I would reduce the salt just EVER so slightly, in the future.)  Thanks for the great recipe & clear, simple instructions, Pam!",

When I brought the fish in the house my wife said it smelled like a real restaurant. The kids asked if I could make it again tomorrow and the day after and the day after.",
