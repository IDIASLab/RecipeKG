I misread the recipe and instead of using grated chocolate I used chocolate chips which of course sunk through the marshmellow mixture and out of sight! However once the pie had set and been covered with broken oreos instead of graham crackers it looked fine. It was most fun as people cut into it and discovered all the chocolate chips at the bottom! I would recommend doing this for children as they loved trying to find them all! ha ha. A happy mistake with a great recipe thank you.",

I also used a premade graham crust. I made this one as it is and its delisious too. A rich and delicious pie.

But any pie base made of sweet biscuits could be used for this too. For the Aussies too I used all the white marshmallows out of 2 Pascalls marshmallow packets. Was about 40 of them. Worked out great though. (now I have to eat all the pink ones!) Really yummy. The guests enjoyed it too - thank goodness as they were taste testers as well! Made a decent sized pie in the springform tin. We have leftovers!",

But I assumed that you do since it said to FOLD into the marshmallow mixture. Also the crust directions are a little vague. I wondered if 16 graham crackers was referring to 16 whole or 16 halves of the whole cracker. I followed the recipe for Graham Cracker Crust I. After making that which used 1 sleeve of crackers I can say that 16 graham crackers refers to 8 whole crackers 16 halves. If I had put 16 whole crackers in (2 sleeves) it would have been all crust! Besides all of that I finally had a slice this morning and was under whelmed in a big way.:-( This is edible but I won't be making again. Sorry!",
