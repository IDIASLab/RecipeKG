I shredded the jicama, added about a cup of cilantro (I love cilantro), added about 2 or 3 tablespoons of freshly shredded ginger, about 3 tablespoons freshly ground dried ancho chile peppers, two granny smith apples --shredded, and about a half cup of mayo.  It was delicious.  I have no idea how the original recipe was, but what I made went perfectly with the grilled pork tenderloin that I made.  I put this salad (more of a slaw after it was shredded) right on the pork tenderloin sandwiches.  OMG.  It was delicious!",

                "reviewBody": "I love jicama, lime and cilantro. This recipe is fair as is but should go one of two ways: spicy or sweet. For spicy I like other reviewers suggestion to add ground chili and/or garlic. For the sweet option, I drizzled about 3 tablespoons honey on top after tossing everything together. It would probably disperse more thoroughly to mix the lime juice and honey together before adding to the jicama. With the sweet version I will also cut back on the cilantro next time, possibly in half. I would also like to add other fruits to the salad independently - watermelon, mango, strawberries, red grapes. The contrast of the deeper colors would look striking in this salad. Honestly, 2 pounds of jicama makes a really large salad so why not divvy it up and try a couple different versions at the same time!",
