It was light healthy and low in fat and calories and I only needed one pan. In addition to the garlic I added a shallot and a half cup of white wine. French style green beans in the can had to suffice because I didn't have frozen ones. I served it with a Sporodoro pasta and hot French bread.There wasn't a drop left over. Because it was so easy and it's healthy I look forward to serving it again. Thank you Nicole.",
