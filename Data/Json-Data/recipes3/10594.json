I made it in my slow cooker using four bone-in short ribs that were especially meaty as opposed some I've had which were mostly fat. Anyway, I followed the recipe exactly and the resulting dish was excellent.  We still have some left over which I'm going to turn into open face beef sandwiches later this week using the leftover sauce as the gravy commonly found with that type of meal.  Should be even better since the flavors will have fully melded.",
