For those who were unsure of the cooking yes you should boil the dahl first. I put quite a bit more dahl than the recipe called for so I doubled the spices to compensate. I've also made it with mung beans instead and it still works beautifully. I make a big batch and eat it with paratha roll it up like a burrito in some naan or tortillas or I use it as the filling for my samosas. Hope this helps!",

(In case you don't know about it here's an important ingredient note: do not use curry powder instead of curry leaves! The powder is a mix of several different spices. The curry leaves are from a tree & are green. They have a unique aroma & flavor - unsubstitutable so beg your Indian grocer to order it for you.)",

I'll definitely make it again. I do not see myself cooking a bunch of beans just to use 1 tbs. & 1 tsp. in a recipe. It was fine without them. I could see adding a cup of beans though.",
