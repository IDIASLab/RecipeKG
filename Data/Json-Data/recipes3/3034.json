I made two little modifications - first I hard-cooked my eggs by boiling them for 12 minutes instead of letting them sit covered in the hot water. I just find that cooks them through better. Also my cooked mixture was a little lumpy - I may have heated it too fast and accidentally cooked the eggs in it. So I blended it in the blender with the mayonnaise which helped make the texture of the dressing nice and creamy. I did like the taste of the fresh veggies and I could taste the tarragon vinegar which was a nice touch so all in all I'd probably make it again but it wouldn't be the first recipe I'd reach for.",

I did add some green onions upon serving but I'm thinking that the salad dressing from the Chicken and Snap Pea Wild Rice Salad would have been perfect with this. Would that make it not a Virginia Style? Not sure. At least this recipe will be a good base for us! Thank you!",

I ve never made a macaroni dressing that had to be cooked. I knew to cook slowly at a low temp so that my beaten egg would not cook. The end results were very good and it was enjoyed at the luncheon. My sons comment to my husband and I was This is one of the better macaroni salad recipes she s tried. You can keep this one. This was a high compliment to the recipe because the one thing that I make that is my family s favorite is my macaroni salad recipe. For my family this was served with Slow Cooker Carolina BBQ from AR. We enjoyed a very delicious meal.",
