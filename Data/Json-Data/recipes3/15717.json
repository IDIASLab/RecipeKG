The texture is softer and almost creamy personally I love that about these cookies. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup of the Carnation Breakfast Essentials it's about 1 1/2 packets. The only change I made was that I used nonstick cooking foil and no cooking spray. My peanut butter is simply dry roasted nuts and no other ingredients. We love these cookies so much that I have already several times.",

Then I went back to Re read the recipe and realized in the description it mentions oats.... but there was no oats in the ingredients or in the directions. Maybe there was a mistake in the recipe because I feel if there were suppose to be oats added then it would make some sense as to why the texture was so off.",
