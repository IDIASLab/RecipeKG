I was really impressed with how fresh and delicious this recipe is. The ginger and lemon make it very special. I also like that it didn't need salt. I substituted whole milk for half and half. It was still very delicious. I plan to make this again soon! Note: I've made this two more times since my initial review. It's become one of our favorite recipes. I can't eat half and half in more than very small quantities. (Oddly something in it hurts my stomach.) For this recipe the solution that I've devised is using skim milk or water to make the gravy. At the end I add a small amount of Nestle Media Crema (shelf stable cream that is inexpensive and packaged in small quantities). It tasted good with milk but is much better with even a small amount of cream.",

However it would benefit from a few little additions. 2 teaspoons of coriander powder 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon dash of nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon of dried Kastoori methi leaves 1 teaspoon poppy seeds and two green chillies (mirchi). After you heat up the oil (I used canola) add one teaspoon of poppy seeds and two chopped green mirchi with the seeds and as that begins to pop add the onion. I added the other ingredients as the recipe recommended along with my additions and then instead of half and half milk and yogurt I used fat free sour cream about half a cup and bit more tomato paste. Adding one cup of water to simmer will also make the tomato cream base less thick once the paneer has been added.",

For me the flavoring was spot-on. I think cooked tofu would make a very good substitute for the paneer if you are avoiding dairy or cutting down on calories but the panner was fantastic. I purchased mine at Indian grocery here in Los Angeles but I think I've seen this kind of cheese at Whole Foods before. As I made this dish I thought to myself hmmm what kindof cheese would be a good substitute for paneer? And I decided the nearest that I've tried would be mozzarella. Mozzarella is softer and melts down in a way that paneer doesn't but the flavor is very similar. Just a thought if you can't find paneer. I think peas would be good in this dish too.",
