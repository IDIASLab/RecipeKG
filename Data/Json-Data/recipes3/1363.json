I also shook it w/ crushed ice instead of cubes because it'll make the drink a bit thicker & frostier using crushed ice. Took a sip & then added a tsp or so of simple syrup (equal amounts sugar & water boiled for a couple of minutes to dissolve the sugar...allow to cool). That not only sweetened up the drink but brought out the flavor of the lychees. Thsi went great w/ Bobby Flay's Chinese Chicken Salad...thanks for the recipe!",

This helped keep it from being too strong as the Vodka I had on hand has quite a distinct flavor on its own. I also didn't have white cranberry juice but used the regular red kind. It ended up a nice light pink color. I think I might try this with gin by adding a bit of lychee juice to a gin and tonic and adding a lychee for garnish.",
