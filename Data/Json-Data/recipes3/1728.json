        "description": "This is a spicy, flavorful pork salad that is eaten as a side or main dish. You can serve it on cabbage or lettuce leaves. It can also be served over shredded cabbage, bean thread (mung bean noodles), or lettuce. Try your local Asian market to find Thai peppers, fish sauce, and fresh mint leaves. Fresh lime juice is important. A lot of prep but worth it in the end. You can also serve over noodles, or chop lettuce and cabbage together and spoon mixture over it in a bowl. You can garnish the mixture with chiles, peanuts, mint leaves, and cilantro leaves. This recipe tastes just like what you get at a Thai restaurant. It will keep in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days.",
