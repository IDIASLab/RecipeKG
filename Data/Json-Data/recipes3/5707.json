If you replace the mangoes in this recipe with green (unripened mangoes) the flavor is more intense and texturally superior. Replace the 4 mangoes with green mangoes (peeled separated from pith and cut into matchsticks - not chunks). Using essentially the same ingredients except nix the olive oil (totally unnecessary fats) add 2-3 tablespoons (varies with size of mangoes) fish sauce and 1 tablespoon sugar PER mango used when dressing with lime cilantro etc. Replace shallots with red onions for a milder flavor. Allow to marinate some 10-15 minutes and top with chopped toasted peanuts or cashews before serving.",
