By FAR the best is using stale hard rolls or very-chewy Italian bread. If you don't, the bread just becomes mushy instead of that wonderful, chewy, garlic-bread bites that is so special in this recipe. Alot of the flavor is from your choice garlic and oil, too. I use a high quality EVOO and FRESH only: minced garlic, mozzarella and basil leaves. If you don't use the fresh, it alters the flavor significantly. I think cherry or grape tomato's texture is better suited for this.  Capers are a nice added flavor and, as I discovered tonight, so is roasted asparagas. With all that being said...made with our preferences, this goes in the favorite file.",

The flavors mix wonderfully and it's the perfect summer salad. It was so hot here today that I toasted the bread on the bbq in a pan of course using the indirect method they came out perfect and had that smokey flavor. I used smart balance instead of olive oil on the bread too. I will make this again and again! Thanks for a great recipe!",
