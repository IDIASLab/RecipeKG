My husband expects MEAT on his dinner plate, so I squeezed the innards out of a couple of large-ish hot Italian sausages and browned it up in a tiny bit of EVOO.  Then I added some sliced fresh crimini mushrooms that needed to be used up.  My canned tomatoes were the plain, common garden variety, so I threw in some chopped onion and minced garlic.  Deglazed the pan with some white wine and used more spinach than called for.  An entire bunch, actually.  The DH has placed a moritorium on me buying anything new to stuff into my over-burdened freezer, so I had to use a bag of frozen three-cheese ravioli instead of the tortellini.  But hey, it's the same thing, only flat, right?  Also I didn't have any whole milk, so I had to use non-fat, but it didn't seem to hurt anything.  This was fantastic!  The sausage and mushrooms gave the sauce a nice beigey color.  I'm sure it would have been prettier with the tortellini, but I had to make do.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!",

For the sauce, I sauteed sliced baby portabella mushrooms with onion and garlic which I added to the tomato mixture.  I also added 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, instead of just 1/4 to the sauce - because really, you can never have enough cheese! It could use more spinach than the recipe calls for, so next time I'll make that change - but this was very wonderful and easy and I will definitely be making it again!",

I think I would have been safe with even a little more garlic (but I really like garlic).  Also, I used milk instead of heavy cream, which should help on the fat and calorie side.  I prefer corn starch as a thickening agent (just be sure to cut the amount by half - you'd need twice as much flour to do the same job).  I was impressed with the flavor of the sauce, and didn't notice too much of a pink tinge that turned off one reviewer.  However, next time, I'll use fresh tomatoes, because I was kinda turned off by the flavor of the canned tomatoes.  In all other respects a wonderful and simple dish that looks and tastes like it took forever!  Will definitely make again!",

I followed the recipe almost exactly- the only difference was I used italian diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano because I didnt have the one specified.  Also I used 5 cloves of fresh garlic and minced it up. I think it could have used even more than that. Otherwise I followed everything and it turned out wonderful, My hubby loved it and my 1 year old ate a good amount of it too! It was a good way to sneak a veggie into him.
