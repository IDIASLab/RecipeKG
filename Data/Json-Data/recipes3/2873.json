While I wouldn't recommend changing a thing, I did try adding a couple of things that might be worth your time trying:  cubed cucumbers, sliced black olives, and different colored sweet peppers.  Something to note as well:  when you first make this salad, it almost appears as if there might be too much dressing.  If you chill it overnight, or even for a few hours, the dressing homogenizes itself and you have just the right amount.  Thank you, Karena, for this great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is the best salad recipe on this site...trust me!  I usually double the recipe and use two green peppers, one red pepper and one orange pepper to make it more colorful.  I prefer to use cavatappi pasta though as I think it does a great job at holding the sauce, more so than ziti would.  Everyone who tries this is left guessing what exactly makes it so good. I think its the pickle juice.  If anyone wonders how much a double recipe of this gives you, well it fits perfectly in the large Tupperware \"Thatsa Bowl\" which makes an ideal amount for picnics and gatherings.  This salad still tastes great 3-4 days after you make it, so make a lot as leftovers will be appreciated by many.  One recommendation I have for this recipe is the addition of grated parmesan cheese.  Just sprinkle about 1/4 cup over the completed dish and stir it in.  I also add a sprinkling of oregano.  This dish is a great recipe and minor alterations and additions can easily be made to suite various palates.  Thanks for adding such a great recipe Karena.  It may take awhile to cut up all the veggies but it is definitely worth the effort!",
