In the former case you create a colony of whatever strain of commercial yeast that you used. Which sort of negates the point of _making_ your own starter; using home grown yeast. In the latter case you all too frequently end up with a smelly paste that is _definately_ not starter. I know this to be fact as I've tried made and discarded many substandard batches of starter in my career. _This_ recipe on the other hand works perfectly rapidly and dependably. It creates a batch of wild yeast- soon enough enfluenced by whatever yeast are floating around in your area- and creates a powerful starter. Powerful enough that no additional yeast is needed to leaven any recipe. (My advice to substitute this starter for packaged yeast in any bread recipe- leave out a cup of flour add a cup of the starter. Add more flour if needed to get proper texture.) Readers might be interested to know that this starter also well replicates the artisinal starters used in high end commercial recipes. Meaning that- quite often- I have seen professional bakers scrape together all manner of thin skinned fruit let it sit for a few days and use the fermented juice as a starter basis. I really like this starter. In fact I've just pulled a batch of it from stasis in the fridge- make certain to pour o",

I always replenish it with whole wheat flour and water and let it sit out of the refrigerator until it is good and bubbly. Then I refrigerate it until I'm ready to use it again. It makes absolutely heavenly waffles and biscuits. The waffles alone are worth making this starter. \r\nThe instructions say to discard the dough during the initial fermentation process. I didn't, but used it in breads and quick breads with good results. The fermentation process was faster than I expected. Maybe the temperature was warm here. Also I started with grapes a bit on the old side. I think they had alreay started to ferment.",

I wasn't sure about the amounts to feed the starter so I just guesstimated and added equal amounts of flour and water each time. The consistency is viscous and the smell is very sour.
