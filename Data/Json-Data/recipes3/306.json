My twist - refrigerate the pineapple until cold; make the jello using 1 cup boiling water, let it cool for about 10 minutes, then blend it and the cottage cheese in the blender until smooth.  Pour the jello mixture in with the pineapple, combine and fold in the whipped topping, refrigerate until cold.  This also makes a great pie, just change up the flavors and fruits and pour into a graham cracker crust.",
