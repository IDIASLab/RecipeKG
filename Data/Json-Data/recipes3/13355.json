Baked it 7 minutes in the oven and reached in a couple times to fork-poke the larger bubbles that formed.  We brushed the crust with olive oil as it says and then put on sauce and cheese.  Being the first go, only used cheese, but will load it down with more toppings next time. Baked the pizza on a Big Green Egg until cheese was bubbly and getting brown spots.  Crust was wonderful and the edges were deliciously crispy.  Will make again within a week with more starter discards.  I made this with starter that was in the fridge and not fed in appx 30 hrs.  Since the starter was cold, I let the dough rest maybe 45 minutes rather than 30 minutes.",
