I made 2 cups of my own sauce instead of the chicken soup (bring 1 cup chicken broth and half a cup milk to a boil.  Stir 6 tablespoons flour into half a cup milk then whisk it into the pot.  Cook a minute or so.  Ta da!).  I was afraid the rice would be too dry which is why I made extra sauce.  I also used corn instead of peas and mixed it in at the beginning, and added half a packet of taco seasoning.  I baked it according to the directions and it came out quite well!  I can't imagine how dry it would be with only one can of soup and even with the taco seasoning it was very, very mild, so next time I'm going to use the whole packet.  Thanks for the idea!",

I substituted frozen corn for the peas (peas didn't make sense to me in this dish).  I only added 1/2 of the green chile and added a can of black beans, rinsed and drained well.  Upon others suggestions, I added about 1/2 package of taco seasoning mix.  I will make this again!",

I baked it longer than directed though based on the feedback of another reviewer and that may have contributed so next time I'm going to bake as directed and let it stand 10 minutes. Standing time often makes a big difference with casseroles. I'll also try adding a bit more milk maybe just a half a cup and see how that works. It really doesn't need much. The flavor is very very good and it makes wonderful leftovers. Personally I wouldn't cook the rice in advance because I think it result in too much liquid but if any of you experiment with good results please post them!",
