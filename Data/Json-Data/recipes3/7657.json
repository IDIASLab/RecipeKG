For years I had been \"threatening\" to make aebleskiver using my Norwegian great grandmother's pan that hangs on our beach cabin's kitchen wall. I didn't really know anything more about them than their name, and was always too intimidated by the project to actually follow through. Laura's recipe changed all that! These are easier to make than I'd imagined, and delicious. Making them twice in one week gave me the opportunity to try different fillings. I used applesauce in some, and whole freshly picked berries (Boysen, Tay, and blueberries) in others. My family liked them best unstuffed and then dipped in syrup, applesauce or whipped cream. Whipping the egg whites is imperative for success, and I used butter in the wells of the cast iron pan. Photos coming up soon. Thanks, Laura!",

I used the batter and made muffins! It totally works. I only made four servings but I baked them at 350 degrees for 13-15 min with the cups 2/3 full of batter. If I could do it again, I would bake them closer to 13...they came out a tiny bit dry but I had to kind of make it up as I went. Delicious. I prepared them with vanilla pastry filling inside, topped off with homemade whipped cream. A great, easy to make recipe you can do anything with.",

I wanted to make these at home and thus started my search for a pan and a recipe. I have tried this recipe a variety of ways: using \"homemade buttermilk\" and trying to whip egg whites in a plastic bowl (it doesn't work that great). What I really love to do is put bits of ground sausage and cheese blueberries or lil smokies in the pan after I've added the batter. I have tried many fillings but these are my faves. Also the recipe says to flip over once but these should really be a round ball. These will be hard to make in a new pan but the more butter and oil you use the more seasoned it gets the easier it will be.",
