A few changes: CHEESE - I always use brie wedges because they're more readily available than the circles. They work fine. Even though I don't LOVE the rind when I eat the cheese raw, I leave it on in this recipe and it all just tastes delicious when cooked. Also, the technique of freezing the brie before you cut it in half works splendidly. PRESERVES - Don't hold back. I use about half an 18 oz. jar per recipe and, like I said, it tastes SO good. ALMONDS - Yes! Add the shaved almonds in between the sandwiched halves of brie and preserves. You'll love it! TEMPERATURE - 400* F works well for me.",

I rolled the puff pastry out with a rolling pin to stretch the dough for the two halves.Just be sure to seal the edges of the puff pastry well.I didn't brush it with egg and it was fine.

I was a little concerned about cutting the soft cheese in half, so I put it in the freezer while my pastry sheet was thawing.  Cut beautifully.  I used raspberry preserves, made beautiful pastry leaves and berries for the top, and served on a cake platter with fresh raspberries around. Wonderful!  This would be terrific for the holidays.  Thanks so much for sharing! Addendum 12/28/08: please note, I place the brie in the freezer only 30 minutes, I do not freeze it, just give it a good chill to set it up for easy slicing!  Hope this helps clarify, Wendy",

Some advice make sure you bake it on a pan that has sides so that if the pastry brakes open the oils from the cheese don't melt all over your oven (speaking from experience). 2 of the 3 times I have made it the pasty has broken open while baking which makes it messy but it is still worth making! It is a very yummy mix. I have received many complements on it. I think next time I will try using half a wheel of brie so the pasty wraps around the whole thing and I can wrap it a little more loosely so that maybe it won't break! Good luck and Bon Appetite!",
