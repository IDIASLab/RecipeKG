It's good for people who aren't big fans of seasoning.  The sauce  tasted good on my rice but the chicken was very eh.  I would definitely add a lot more seasoning to this chicken.  You could barely taste the orange.  Maybe some zest would have helped or a real orange.  I'm going to reheat tomorrow after it sits in the sauce and see if the flavor sinks in.",
