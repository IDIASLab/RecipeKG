I paid attention to Christina's review and cut down on the pepper and added more cheese but the crust is rather different than a regular dough crust. Perhaps due to the ratio of beer to flour (I was surprised at the low amount of flour actually) this ends up to be a rather flat much less doughy crust than I prefer. The texture almost reminds me of a flat cornbread and that's not really a hit for me so I'll keep looking. Thanks for the recipe!",

IMO there was too much pepper and not enough cheese to be called a 'cheesy pizza crust'. A more appropriate name would've been spicy or peppery pizza crust b/c the pepper really over-powered the rest of the ingredients. This smelled great but just didn't hit the flavor mark for us...Thanks for sharing.",
