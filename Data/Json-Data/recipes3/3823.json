It shouldn't be tender or mushy but firm and chewy. More so than say converted rice. BUT if you like it... GREAT! and Jenn really it needs the butter if not to brown the meat to give it that wonder full carmelization full of flavor and appearence then the butter flavor for the bulger (bughlur in Armenian). Again however if you like it that way... GREAT! It might be said now that bulgur is high in protien and bran and soooo yummo. My non-Armenian wife and Asian decent buddy live for this when I make it (my family recipe coming soon so look for it. Authentic and easily made in a rice cooker). Geddamame I feel bad for you. This stuff is great no matter how you throw the dice. Tabbulli is GREAT! Good stuffing for roasted chicken with herbs shallots garlic etc.",

I put everything in a casserole dish in a moderate oven for an hour or so adding the bulgar 30 minutes before we want to eat. Most of the time I don't even bother to brown the meat (saves on all that butter) and I always use tinned tomatoes. Easy and delicious!",
