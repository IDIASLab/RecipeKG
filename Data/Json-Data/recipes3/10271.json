I've eyed this recipe for a long time now and there is no way I could find the mushrooms called for. But I needed to try this recipe (it has been calling to me). So I had to use dried mushrooms that Trader Joe's has available this during the holidays (porcini shiitake black & oyster mushrooms) and they are a far cry from those called for. And I used red potatoes. Other than that I used the recipe as written. I thought it could have used a little more garlic and maybe more seasoning. It's possible that the other mushrooms would have added that flavor---and I'd love to try them. I'll keep looking for them. Thanks Chef!",

To save time I boiled the potatoes while the mushrooms cooked on the stove then threw them all together in the oven. I only baked them about 15 minutes (did stir them after 8 minutes) then pulled them out and poured the sauce over (2T balsamic 1T cream sherry 2t dried tarragon 1t garlic powder). We liked them but they were a tad sweet. would make again and definitely try to be closer to the original though this was fine too.",
