I used 1/2 pound of beef (it's all that I had) and an entire eggplant which covered a 9x13 pan fine. I used instant potatoes and added some butter to the potatoes when finished. The recipe says 1 hour 25 minutes til ready; but mine was ready much quicker. I'd say all in all 50 minutes from prep to eating. You could even do the meat base (minus the eggplant and mashed potatoes) in the AM or crock-pot and put it together at dinner.",

Very tasty and will definitely make it again. Made a few minor changes to make it easier: 1) A little less olive oil to fry the onions and garlic. 2) Add and brown the ground beef but hold off on adding the spices and tomatoes. 3) DRAIN the ground beef to get the fat and extra oil out. 4) In a separate bowl stir in the spices (also add one teaspoon of cumin as per a reviewer's suggestion) into the crushed tomatoes and once the ground beef is drained add it. I did sprinkle a tiny bit of Greek Seasoning along with sea salt and pepper on the oiled eggplant before broiling on each side. It all came together beautifully but the leftovers the next day were even better! Keeping this recipe for sure.",

I used ground beef and ground venison (cause that's what I had on hand). In the future I'd brown the meat first drain off the grease and then add to the onions/garlic as the recipe called for. I added just a touch of hot sauce to give this alittle kick. I served it over Chinese Cabbage very hot to wilt the cabbage and that is what made it good. The cinnamon clove and raisins make for an interesting flavor. None of which overwhelmed the dish. I liked it alot.",
