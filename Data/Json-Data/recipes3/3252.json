I have been trying to copy Quizno\u2019s (a fast food place) broccoli cheese soup and this comes close.  While the cheese was melting in a smaller pot, the frozen broccoli was simmering in a soup pot with the instant chix stock  (I used 3t of chicken base like a previous reviewer)and the water used to reconstitute it, about 4 oz. Extra cheddar cheese and milk took the place of the cream since I rarely have it.  Turned out great.",

(a local favorite)I personally thought it could use a little more broccoli and I did not like the vague amount of water it called for in the recipe but I used commom sense and added just enough water to thin it out some.
