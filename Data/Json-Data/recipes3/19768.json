Tripled the recipe since it was such a large crowd to feed, and they were devoured!\r\nRead all of the previous reviews and incorporated several of them into the recipe.\r\n1.  Definitely use much less mayo... just enough to moisten.  \r\n2.  Green onion works quite nicely in texture, taste, and overall presentation.\r\n3.  Cut bacon, then cook.\r\n4.  Added a little garlic powder and Hot Shots.\r\n5.  Bought 16 oz can biscuits b/c that's what the recipe called for... used the flaky grands buttermilk biscuits, cut them in 1/4's, shaped them into balls, then rolled with a rolling pin to flatten... makes nice little cups this way.\r\n5.  Was having to travel a long way with these in the car, so I cooked them the night before, kept them in a cooler on ice, then reheated them in the microwave when we got to the party.  They turned out fine after their long journey.\r\n\r\nWill consider using cream cheese/milk mixture next time that previous reviewer suggested.\r\nMay also try different variations such as \r\ncanned chicken, pizza, quiche, philly cheese steak, ham, you name it!\r\nGreat thing about this delightful recipe is the  possibilities are endless!!",

You can make the filling a day ahead and then it takes only a minute to stuff the muffin tins and bake. It sits well at room temperature and I haven't found anyone that doesn't love them. Cut back a little on the mayo because it can cause them to become a little greasy when sitting around. I make triple what the recipe calls for and they are still gone.

Although phyllo shells are more expensive than refrigerated dough, I thought it was well worth the extra expense when I did a side by side taste test. The phyllo shells make this a flaky crispy treat, while the dough makes it so soft that the outer shell blends in texture wise with the filling. I prefer phyllo shells with this...I will definitely be making this recipe for my New Years Eve buffet. Thanks Kelli!",

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and only added enough mayonnaise to moisten and hold the filling mixture together, which was about 1/3 cup. My other changes to the recipe were to cook the onion in a bit of the bacon fat before adding it to the filling mixture because I don't care for a sharp onion flavor. I didn't have any dried basil, so I added about 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley (mainly for color) and a little chopped fresh sage and savory. It was a super easy recipe to prepare and the results look like you went to a lot of effort. I didn't find 1/2 a biscuit to be too much dough, I thought it made a pretty puffed appearance to the cups (I tried some with 1/2 and some with 1/3 a biscuit). Make sure your biscuit dough is cold for easiest separation into  layers. My only negative about the recipe would be that I have never eaten canned refrigerated biscuits before, so the slightly sweet flavor of the dough was not something I was accustomed to. Nobody else seemed to care. I did think they tasted best after standing for 10-15 minutes rather than hot straight from the oven",

I however expected to love them and just thought they were okay. I scaled the recipe to make 24 used fresh-grated sharp cheddar cheese instead of Swiss fried and drained my own bacon and used just a few teaspoons of sour cream in place of the mayonnaise. I think the bacon was way too overpowering and that's all I tasted (and I LOVE bacon!) I wanted to use the phyllo cups like so many people suggested but my grocery store was out of them. I used the buttermilk biscuits and by all means definitely cut them into quarters! I couldn t imagine using these in halves that would be WAY too much dough for the mini muffin tins!! Also be weary of putting too much filling in these mine overflowed in the oven upon baking whoops! Anyway I will definitely make these again as like I said my friends raved about them but I think I'll definitely cut back on the amount of bacon called for.",
