Browned up nicely super moist and simply bursting with flavor. First you get a pop of sweetness from the apple and next the maple syrup flavor kicks in. I thought even the texture of the turkey sausage was better and closer to what you find with traditional pork sausage. Next time I might even give it a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes which might be an interesting contrast to the sweetness. Lil Snoo thanks for sharing this one s a keeper.",

Next time I make this, I will add the red pepper flakes directly in, or possibly just a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. \n\nWith homemade artisan herb dough, homemade sauce, onions, peppers and fresh grated mozz my non pepperoni side was 255 calories and 105 sodium per slice!",
