The mixture EASILY could fill 6 caps- especially if you chop the stems and add them back to the topping mix. I shredded the fontina cheese instead of slicing.

I will definitely make this again as I prefer veggies over grain carbs. This is DELICIOUS!",

First of all, the stuffing was enough for six large portobello mushrooms, not two.  Second, 4 cloves of RAW garlic is a lot; when garlic cooks it gets sweeter, but in this dish it stays raw--I love garlic and it was way to much for me.  Third, I used only 1 c. of arugula and it was more than enough.  Another issue was that after cooking the mushrooms for 5 minutes, my sheet pan was full of liquid.  I had to drain my mushrooms on paper towels--these were the freshest mushrooms I could buy, so be prepared for that additional step or you'll have a soggy mess.  In the end, it did look pretty and was tasty, especially if you have friends who like to eat low carb, it's a keeper.  But be aware that you'll need to adjust this recipe to make it work.",
