        "description": "My daughter Dylan (age 5) is the light of my life. She is smart, funny, and very creative. I try to encourage her as much as I can. Last week, Dylan told me she had an idea for soup. She wanted to make a soup with carrots, potatoes, cheese, and a little parsley. We had the good fortune to be at Seattle's Pike Place Market over the weekend and bought all the yummy ingredients fresh. The soup was absolutely delicious so I just had to share! Here's her recipe. Of course you can use fresh onion, fresh garlic, etc. However, I really wanted to stay true to my daughter's vision. The soup was wonderful, so I'm glad that I resisted the temptation to add a few things here and there. Enjoy!",
