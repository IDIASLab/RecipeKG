                "reviewBody": "Good recipe but directions at least for me could be changed. Why fry the onions in a separate pan in olive oil when you've got bacon grease? Fry the bacon remove it to a paper towel and dump the chopped onions in the hot grease. After a few minutes add the flour and make your cream sauce in the pan. Perfect! I left my cauliflower florets fairly large because I had small new potatoes to use and wanted them to be the same size. I wish I'd cut my potatoes smaller but that was my fault. I didn't have swiss cheese but used a few remnants I had left in my fridge which was mostly a combination of mozzarella provolone and sharp cheddar. Also there's no way that needs to be put in a 9x13 pan. I used a small Pyrex casserole and it fit perfectly. Overall the casserole was good and I enjoyed it for my lunch. It's like au gratin potatoes with cauliflower and bacon added in.",

                "reviewBody": "Like \"Its a New Day \" I cooked the bacon first and fried the onions in the grease then used the onion/grease to make the sauce. The only other change I made was to use whole milk instead of cream and to layer everything instead of mix together (this was because I was short on time). The cheese sauce managed to get through to the bottom and everything was coated in the cheese sauce. Oh and for \"salt to taste\" in the sauce I used 1 teaspoon. The family liked it a lot. I think they still prefer the \"loaded cauliflower cassarole \" but this is a happy second choice for what to make when I get a cauliflower in the CSA box.",

I am in China and this is radish season so I sliced a large red radish and boiled with the potatoes. I didn't have cream but I don't think it lacked richness. With the potatoes and radish I didn't have room for the cauliflower so that stayed in the frig. I like green peppers and added that to the onion. Following the other reviews I fried the bacon and used the rendered fat to saute the onions and green pepper. I made a roux with the fat and some flour and remained relatively faithful to the recipe after that. Very versatile and yummy!",
