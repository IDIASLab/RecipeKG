I had never worked with Basil before and as I was cutting it up I was surprised at the strong aroma. I cut back a bit but upon reflection the creaminess of the cheese really does subdue the basil and now wish I had added all the Basil that was called for. Garlic added a nice touch!! Super easy to make!!! I used about 6 pinches of course salt (without additives; like the kind used for pickling). Thanks a bunch for sharing!! Next time I will try with different herb combinations!!",

I did 4-1/2 cups (1 L) goat's milk 2 tbsp (30 ml) distilled white vinegar 2 heaping tsp fresh chopped basil and 1 large minced garlic. I let it drain too long (became distracted by kids) and it was a little dry. To moisten it up again I added a few teaspoons of whey back into the curd until it had a 'spreadable' consistancy again. This is great with salted crackers. My two year old couldn't get enough of them. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe Ranchgurl! This is going into my Keeper File.",
