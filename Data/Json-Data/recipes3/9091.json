Tonight I'll reheat and add fresh chopped Italian parsley on top.  \nAnd,  I could totally see adding the whole pound of bacon.  Not all bacon is created equal, but just like the poor egg got unjustly misaligned for so long, so did bacon.  Enjoy your bacon !

So.....this year for St. Patty's Day, gonna do the corned beef in the crockpot with potatoes and carrots, and THIS fried cabbage recipe (with those canned mushrooms I mentioned above) on the side instead of in the crock with the rest of the stuff.
