I made it delicious and fairly healthy by sauteeing the squash and garlic for a few minutes in a small amount of butter removing from heat and adding a good amount of chopped fresh basil and then adding 1-2 servings of reduced fat cream cheese before microwaving to melt the cheese. A small amount of cream cheese goes a long way and you can reduce the fat to 3-6 grams per serving with my modification. Fresh basil is essential for a \"wow\".",

I also used Neufchatel instead of full-fat cream cheese and fresh basil instead of dried. This was wonderful and my husband and I gobbled it up.
