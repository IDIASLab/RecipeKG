I add a fresh banana pepper too when I have one.",

I agree with others who use some garlic (dried roasted or minced fresh garlic if making the salad ahead a little so it can mellow a bit in the dressing) one or more Italian styled pickled peppers dried Italian herbs of one or more type when fresh are not available and one vinegar or another (depending on the mood of the day and what's available) oh - and even a touch of sugar sometimes. Left the seeds in our more typical type cucumber and it was simply refreshing anyway. Might add pasta or beans with this salad if the meal is lean in the carb or protein area as well. (pssst - Really we only use sugar more as a seasoning to take the edge off of the vinegar but mostly because we don't use enough oil to do the job traditionally.) I like to make this with extra vinegar and oil (more vinegar than oil) and use the whole salad to top a green salad. Yum! Very refreshing!",
