I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic so that my two year old would be more inclined to try them (and I was glad I did this as she liked them) and I omitted the parsley and red pepper. But the olive oil was too much for it both the quantity and the flavor. I will definitely try this again but next time I'll mix garlic powder and salt into melted butter (not olive oil) to make a garlic spread sort of thing and pour it over the hot knots. Thanks Jimmbo it's just my tastes that are wonky.:)",
