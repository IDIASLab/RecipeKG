I recommend mashing the tofu rather than cutting it into 1/2\" blocks if you want even distribution throughout the burger. I used chopped garlic and more of it. I also used only 1/2 # of ground beef and 3/4 of a block of firm tofu. This made 4 med sized and 2 small patties. I sliced the rest of the tofu and let the slices saute in the savory and sweet sauce at the bottom of the skillet for 5 minutes over med heat before flipping. Need to like tofu for that last part though. Thanks Mariko.",
