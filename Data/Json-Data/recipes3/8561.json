I made a few changes because I did not need this much and I prefer chopping ham to buying ham spread. I used my food processor and ground the ham. I added the yolks and other ingredients to processor and made it in no time. I used only 6 eggs and 1 pound of asparagus. I also cut the cheese sauce to 3 tbsp each of flour and butter added only 1 cup of milk and made the sauce. Once I had piped the yolk mixture into the whites I used an 8\" square pan. Piping the yolks by cutting a corner off a ziploc or other plastic bag made it easy and clean up a breeze. I prefer Panko style bread crumbs but used the corn flakes and loved it. Will make many more times as my husband doesn't like deviled eggs or asparagus but loved this.",

Deliciously decadent and must be shared with lot of people that can handle this much cream butter & cheese and it looks beautiful! I will be making this again but plan to modify it with a sharper cheddar and finding a way to make a vegetarian alternative. Possible something with mushroom or marinated artichoke.",
