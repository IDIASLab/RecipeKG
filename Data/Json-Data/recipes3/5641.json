Leave out the cheeses! Diced carrots can be added with the onion and frozen peas can be added with the corn for variety. Hope you enjoy!",

I added the bacon sauteed onion/garlic potatoes chicken broth spices and the corn to my crockpot and cooked them on LOW for most of the day. Once I got home I turned the heat down on my crockpot and lightly smushed the potatoes with my old fashioned potato masher then added the cream and the cheeses. The soup was okay but it didn't have nearly enough bacon cheese or spices. After tasting it I did throw in more monterey jack/cheddar cheese and a few more spices. Not a bad soup that worked out well for me in the crockpot. I don't know that I would make this soup again.",
