So at the end of this recipe you'll have about 1 1/2 cups of food. I used diced dried apples instead of golden raisins and this worked well. You'll need a big pot in the beginning in order to hold all the spinach but it whithers quickly.",

I noticed before I added the vinegar this dish was somewhat bitter but after the addition of the vinegar the bitter was gone and I liked the dish much more. I think I might try making it again.",
