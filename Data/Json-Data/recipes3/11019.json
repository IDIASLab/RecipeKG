I added it last and quit when the batter was the consistency that I was looking for. They were yummy and quite satisfying. It's been a long time since I've had pancakes!",

I added about 1/4 cup of water to thin to pancake consistency but likely the ratios of ingriendients got messed up.  Bobs egg replacement gets very thick and this might be the reason for the thick batter.  The taste was good but didnt have the usual lightness of pancakes. Im going to try again using just 2 eggs and see if that works better",
