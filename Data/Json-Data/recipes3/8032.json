I cut up my raw shrimp and marinated over night in fresh lemon and lime juice. I drained and dropped them in boiling water for a few minutes until cooked, and drained. This gave the shrimp a nice flavor! I followed the recipe after that,leaving out the avocado. I served them with tortilla chips and the avocado on the side. I made 3 pounds of shrimp and they were scraping the bowl for more!\n\nBeautiful presentation!",
