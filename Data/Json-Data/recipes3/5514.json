I used one clove of garlic and 1/2 tsp. salt and was very glad I made those adjustments. I think this is an \"either you like it or you don't\" kind of recipe, no in between. Hubby said it was ok, but nothing special.  But the fact that he only tried one taste and didn't go back for more spoke more accurately--he didn't care for this at all. While I liked it a little better than he did, I don't believe I'd make a point of making this again. A bit lacking in flavor, this was nothing extraordinary or memorable. ",
