I cut out the mushrooms (which I love, hubby don't like) and added 1/2 cup of diced carrots and 1 tablespoon of pimento or to your taste.  It comes jarred at the grocery store.  Have also used this with half and half or milk if you don't have the cream on hand.  Still turns out great.  If it turns out to thin, take a little cold water and corn starch whisk together and add to pan for desired thickness.  Thanks for the post.",

Turkey or chicken, it doesn't matter, and in my case I used rotisserie chicken--and much more than the recipe called for. I also sauteed diced red pepper and onion with the mushrooms, found I needed to double the flour, and added about 1-1/2 T. of dry sherry. I served this in puff pastry shells and garnished the plate with minced fresh parsley. Three stars as written, five stars after some embellishing.",
