I made this as written except for cutting my veggies a little chunkier than called for because I like them barely cooked - and I also put the chopped tomatoes at the very end because I had a tomato-hater in the house. This was my first time eating hot jicama and I really liked it in this. Asedero cheese behaves similarly to an American processed cheese, so subbing with a processed Jack cheese would bring you close to the intentional flavor and texture of this dish if you are unable to get Asedero . Thanks for the recipe - delicious!",

Instead of using a cup of cheese my idea was to just melt a little and then drizzle it over the finished dish. Problem is that it had been a long time since I had bought this kind of cheese and I had forgotten how thick is stays after melted. All I had to thin it out was half n half. So much for less fattening..ha ha. Next time I will use the entire cup of cheese and make as written. We enjoyed this very much. The jicama did stay a bit crunchy as others mentioned but we liked it that way. Almost forgot my tomatos had gone bad without me knowing it so I substituted with some red bell pepper. This is a great side to go with Mexican meals. Thanks for sharing Linda!",
