I use a little less potato starch and throw some caraway seeds and rice in the filling, leaving a more meaty texture and a bit more flavor, in my opinion. Serve with brunsaus (brown gravy), rice, and boiled potatoes. Agurksalat (cucumber salad) is a great accompaniment to this dish.",

Loved the flavors especially the carroway seeds. Made 8 rolls. Had a little mixture left so I added some bread crumbs and rolled into 6 meatballs. Will cook them tomorrow. I am not really big on the traditional tomato based cabbage rolls but these were awesome. Served with mashed potatoes and buttered carrots. Topped the rolls with a yummy beef and mushroom gravy",
