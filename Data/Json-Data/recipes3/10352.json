                "reviewBody": "These are a great low calorie, low sugar snack! My recommendation to help those who have trouble with the carrots crisping up would be to lay them out in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with paper towels, lightly salt the slices (I used a mandolin and sliced them diagonally), wait about 20-30 minutes, then place another layer of paper towels on top of the slices to soak up the moisture. Leave the paper towels on for about 10-15 minutes, then continue as directed with the recipe. This technique is helpful with all veggie chips, as vegetables contain high amounts of moisture. I made them twice, using salt and pepper, then again using a bit of brown sugar. I'm going to try soaking them in brandy with brown sugar and cinnamon next. Since carrots are naturally sweet, the sugar amount used should be negligible (about 1 tbs per 4 med carrots).",

After tossing with a sprinkle of oil and salt I spread them in the pan and baked 6 minutes on the top rack then 6 minutes on the bottom rack. They were still raw. I alternated racks for the next 15 minutes and they never \"toasted\" (I even tried broiling them at the end). They taste like raw soggy carrot peels.

There\u2019s a fine line between not being crisp enough and over browned (yeah, I had a few), so watch them closely.  On the positive side, even the over browned ones were incredibly sweet.  The carrot slices shrink substantially, so keep that in mind when you\u2019re thinking about number of servings.  For us, this recipe would equate to 2 servings, not 4.  They may not be pretty, but trust me, you won\u2019t be able to eat just one, they are surprisingly good.",

The bigger issue was that  the carrots wouldn't crisp. If the carrots were thicker slices (Im talking 1/8 of an inch) they would just stay moist and bendy (even if baked for 4x the time in recipe). If they were thin, they would STILL either stay moist, or burn. Sometimes the ends would burn and the middle would stay moist and bendy. Also the texture was super rubbery.",
