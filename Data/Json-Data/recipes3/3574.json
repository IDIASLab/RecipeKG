I made the following changes: Used 5 cups of skin-on Red Potatoes, added 3 cloves of mashed garlic to the leeks, about 2 tsp of Cayenne and 1 tsp of onion powder. Also I substituted half and half for the heavy cream. After simmering, I used a hand blender to smooth it out. Very warm, flavorful and satisfying. Next time I'll reduce the butter to 3/4 cup and not salt the soup until the end. Between the butter and broth, it's plenty salty already.",

I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.",

I add some white wine towards the end of the 15 minutes of cooking the leeks and let it cook off.  When I add the broth, I also add cayenne and ground mustard.  Finally, I use one sweet potato along with any other potatoes I have on hand.  I love the sweet flavor it adds.  I also use my potato masher at the end to mush it all a little bit for a creamier soup.",
