Huge success!!!\nI did alter a little for our taste preference. \n-For the wet ingredients, I beat the egg separately, and for the 2/3 cup milk, I combined 1/2 and 1/2 and 2% milk. \n-For the topping, I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic and a little more than 1/4 teaspoon of dried parsley, plus a pinch of salt. \n-For the dry ingredients I used about 1/2 the salt (since I was adding some into my melted butter), went heavy handed on the cheese and sprinkled a little extra of the garlic. \nIt was amazing. Will definitely add this to my recipe go to file!",

I replaced the all purpose flour, baking soda, and salt with two cups of self rising flour, and the egg with one and a half tbsp vegetable oil, one and a half tbsp water, and half a tsp baking powder. I also had to use granulated garlic instead of garlic powder (I don't think this made much of a difference). \n\nIn the end, I could tell that the biscuits weren't quite right, but I'm 88% certain that was the fault of my own lack of the called for ingredients. Despite that, they were perfectly edible and I'll be making the recipe again when I do have the right ingredients.
