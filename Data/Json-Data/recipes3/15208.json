I cooked this on low for 3 hours and then turned off and came back hours later and turned it on high for 45 minutes with the added basil and didn't have any issues with dryness that was reported in another review. Next time I'll add one more Thai chili pepper and also add the red bell pepper when I add the basil so they are a bit firmer. Definitely will make again!",

I didn't find this recipe that great even though I added the extra ingredients. It was ok but if you like extra spice then it was a bit bland. I guess its not a thai curry so that's why the recipe didn't call for coconut milk or curry paste. I won't make it again.",
