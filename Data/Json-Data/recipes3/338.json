                "reviewBody": "Instead of all the work of stretching around bowls here is what I did. I turned on the oven to 350 and ran it for about 1 1/2 minutes and turned it off. I put a oven safe dish of hot water on the lowest rack setting and then put frozen bread loaves uncovered on a greased cookie sheet and put them on a rack above the water dish and closed the oven. It takes around 2 hrs for the dough to rise. Then take the bread out and pull it apart into 5 chunks per loaf of dough. Use your hands and make it into a ball making sure the bottom is somewhat flat and solid then put back on the cookie sheet and into the warm oven to rise again for about 30-45 minutes. They will naturally rise again and form the shape of a bowl. Brush w/ eggwash or butter/olive oil whichever you like and bake at 350 for 17-22 minutes. Let them cool. When cool cut off the top w/ a bread knife and gently take out the inside but leave at least 1/4 inch on all the inside area. Gently push your fingers around the inside to firm up inside and bake the bowls for up to 10 more minutes to crisp up. It may sound like a lot when it is typed out but it is very easy. Frozen bread dough is very tough to pull and stretch w/o tearing so this route is simple. You could even just cover the frozen loaves of bread overnight on a table or counter w/ plastic and towel on a greased cookie sheet and that would take care of the first step before forming the circles. I also sometimes mix in italian seasoning or parmesan chee",

My only problem was getting the bowls to be big enough; my dough was still a little frozen which didn't help but I couldn't roll 1/4 lb of my dough out to 8 inches to save my life. But even though my bowls were shallow they were still pretty tasty! Make sure you really coat the bowls and the baking sheet with oil or cooking spray because the dough sticks on like superglue if you miss a spot!",
