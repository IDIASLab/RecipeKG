It would make nice french toast.",

On the other hand if you want a bread that tastes like cream cheese this bread does. I halved the recipe and then had to add in a lot more flour. I ended up adding about 3 cups but the dough was still pretty sticky anyway. It baked up nice--be careful with the rising. I thought it would be fine and it went over the pan a bit after baking. But aside from the funny lopsideness of the bread it looks good. This bread isn't too sweet at all and would work as a hearty sandwich loaf because of that. I like it but just needs more flour--I say that bc just glancing at the ratios it didn't look right at all. Adding a cup or two more of flour is essential otherwise it's good. Thanks for the recipe!",
