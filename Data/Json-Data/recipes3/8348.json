I cheated and used a bag (750g) of mediterannian veggies that were already chopped and ready to go only taking the time to add an onion (as everything else was already in the mix). I also added a few more spices for personal preference and used less chicken broth (I like the sauce thicker). I also didnt have bread crumbs so I crushed crutons in a ziplock bag and used that instead. The only thing I would change is to possibly add garlic to the roasted veggies. I can totally see this being made at my house often. UPDATE I used garlic in the veggies and it was PERFECT!",

                "reviewBody": "I'd do 3.5 stars if I could b/c this is somewhere between good and pretty good. The eggplant turned my alfredo sauce an institutional beige color. More importantly, I really don't like mushy noodles (for example, I never eat soup containing pasta b/c it's always water-logged). By pre-cooking the pasta as the recipe instructs, the pasta was mushy. I think this recipe is flexible on what veggies you use--I did the eggplant and squash, but added green pepper, a few baby carrots and a chopped tomato. I only had half the cheese amount and it was plenty cheesy, but then again, I used \"four cheese\" alfredo sauce by Classico. Another downside is it requires a ton of dishes to be dirtied and it took quite a while between roasting the veggies and getting the casserole assembled. I think casseroles should be chuck it all in and pop it in the oven--easy, one dish.",

This way when i drained and added the chicken and veggies and cheese and tossed it in the oven the noodles didnt come out too mushy like another reviewer complained. I also didnt add any broth because i'd liked it to be creamer. I added mushrooms cuz i had them and added some garlic salt to the veggies when roasting. I also freeze any extra for up to 3 months and toss it back into the oven when i need dinner quick.",
