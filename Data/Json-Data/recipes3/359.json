I used heavy cream instead of milk and I used Dove-dark chocolate topping and it was so yummy.  I put it on the \"fabulous fudge chocolate cake\" recipe from this site and WOW what a chocolate fix for a chocolate lover!  I agree with another reviewer that it doesn't set up well on a hot day with high humidity-so I stuck the whole cake in the fridge after I iced it and it set up well.  I took it out 20 minutes before I served it and it was great..Try and make a day or two in advance because chocolate anything tastes better a few days later when the great chocolate flavors come out!",

This is not a deep, rich chocolate which I liked, especially for the banana cake I chose to use it on.  But it's easy enough, however, to increase the cocoa powder and decrease the powdered sugar by the same amount if you wanted a deeper, darker frosting.  The texture is especially excellent.",

For the hot fudge topping, I used Mrs Richardson's Chocolate Lover's Fudge straight out of the jar, not heated.  I also added a pinch of salt.  The frosting was perfect, not runny or thick but just right for spreading.  It turned out beautifully and tasted fantastic.  It is very rich which was fine with me because I love dark chocolate.",
