One note, I didn't add all the butter mixture to the chicken, as it was quite a lot.  Half of the mixture (with the full amount of herbs, just half the butter) works wonderfully as well.  Or make the full batch, and use the rest of the herb butter for bread, etc.  Additionally, I did not have kitchen twine, and so used dental floss (clean, of course!) and it worked perfectly!  Not the quickest of recipes, it is a crowd pleaser.",

The chicken was very moist and flavorful. I changed the way I roasted it, though----I roasted it at 500 degrees for 20 minutes, breast side down, and then I flipped the chicken and turned the temp down to 375 and baked until done. Nice crispy chicken. My husband and I just LOVED it. Thanks for sharing!!!",

But I was able to still use it as accents for the rest of the meal...some in the mashed potatoes a little on the steamed green beans and finally some on the table to spread on the bread. I still had a lot left over so I can use this later in the week for other things. I will make this recipe again and next time I will take into account that the time needs to be pretty much doubled. The flavor was what made the recipe. I am going to look for more by this person!:)",

I baked this chicken uncovered at 375 degrees for exactly 1 hour 15 min, then removed and tented with foil for an additional 15 minutes before carving (my bird was approx 2.5 lbs).",
