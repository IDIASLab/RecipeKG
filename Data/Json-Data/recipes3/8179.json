I actually cook the hash brown potatoes in a little bit of butter on top of the stove in non-stick fry pan. I don't really try to get any color on the potatoes other than just a very light brown. After the potatoes are completely cooked I add a few more ingredients. I add the half and half along with pecorino Romano cheese and spices. I use Aromat seasoning. I procede to cook the entire potato mixture in the oven for about 15 minutes. After the mixture pics up a very little bit of color on the bottom it is done. When's season properly this potato mixture is the best casserole potatoes you ever had. It is creamy and delicious. Plus it doesn't require a long amount of cooking time. So there's absolutely no way that you're going to curdle the half and half mixture.",
