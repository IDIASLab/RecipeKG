Personally, I do not care for cornmeal so when a traditional recipe like this called for breadcrumbs and parmesan, I had to try it.  I also object to deep frying for health reasons.  So I pan fried these in a non-stick pan with a bit of Pam and they turned out fabulous.  That was why we had them twice!  And the second time, I inadvertently used a tablespoon of garlic powder vs a teaspoon.  DH says I can double that again, next time.",
