I wanted to follow the recipe to a T but the amount of pasta in a box of penne was a LOT so already I found myself modifying amounts. I used 1/2 the box of penne and used the other 1/2 on a different recipe I was prepping for freezer meals. I used more than 4TBSP of marinara - more like 1 cup. Everything else was following the recipe closely! It got my husband's stamp of approval and was almost too easy for me to make so I'll definitely add it into my rotation. I would be eager to see what others do to enhance their version of this dish to modify it some more next time. Perhaps a couple of veggies to add some sweetness or crunch? Thank you for sharing!",
