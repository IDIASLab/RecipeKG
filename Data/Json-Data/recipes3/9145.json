        "description": "My Mississippi grandmother, Bip, would be well over 120 years old if still alive today. Yet she is still living in our thoughts, often because we still enjoy so many of her recipes. This is one that my family has enjoyed for many, many years and always gets passed down to the next generation. Its tart but sweet taste adds to any dish. We use it as a  condiment for meats, salads, eggs, or as a spread with cream cheese and fancy crackers. I've even stuffed jalapenos with it. Its uses are limited only by one's imagination. It's a deliciously wonderful relish to have on hand.",
