Okay, I'm being a little dramatic, but I really loved the unusual look and feel, as well as the internal flavoring opportunities the multi-layer technique provides. I look forward to seeing what you come up with! Served here with a salad and a squeeze of lemon on top.",

I followed the recipe except for a couple of things:  I used colby jack cheese and I used some rosemary and basil.  Be careful not to use too much of any herbs because ours was just a little over the top with flavor.  The best thing about this is that you can get it ready for cooking ahead of time, making it a good option for company.  I probably cooked the packet of meat about 15-20 minutes, and that was just right.  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks, Chef John!",
