I put everything in a saucepan med flame for 10 min. stirred it up and: Fabulous! This will be my recipe from now on!! It is even better the next day. So this could be a day-before recipe too!

It turned out very tart--I added about a 1/4 c. of white sugar--and not quite as 'apple saucy'-as I wanted. I think next time I'll raise the apple-to-cranberry ratio maybe with same # of apples but only one bag of cranberries. This left me with 1 1/2 qt of sauce plenty for a large dinner party.",
