A tad greasy but expected with the sausage. If making with sausage again I would cut down on the melted butter in the pan by at least 1/2 or try cooking spray. The butter was oozing up over the mixture as I spread it in the pan. I think I'll try swiss and turkey sausage next time.",

I kind of feel like the majority of this recipe is fattening filler rather than spinach.  All of these are rather fattening but the Spinach Brownie recipe calls for 2 frozen boxes of spinach or ten oz of fresh.  At least you are getting more of the nurtients I was looking for.  Although, when I made the other recipe in the past, I added bacon as one reviewer suggested...making it even more unhealthy! :)  That's probably what made it so good. I would probably make these again but I didn't find they had that quiche texture like the other recipe had and that's what I was looking for.  These were a little more mushy than the others.  Still really good though!  Great for breakfast too.",

The casserole has a nice unique flavor and you can barely taste the spinach (which is a good thing in my opinion since I don't really like spinach). A few more seasonings may make it tastier but it worked for me as written. Thanks for the recipe!",
