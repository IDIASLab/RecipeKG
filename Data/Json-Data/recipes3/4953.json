Oh anything handy. lol Panko bread crumbs are just stale white bread grated on box grater large holes. I am a miser and learned that one long ago. Four stars cause of changes.

It does make a lot however so all that work pays off when you easily pull out leftovers from the freezer! I only made a couple changes I doubled the garlic powder and hot sauce and instead of corn meal I used bread crumbs I made from some old rye bread also I fried in peanut oil (vegetable oil is not good for you!) The whole fam really enjoyed these husband was pleasantly surprised 10 yr old asked for seconds and 7 yr old was happy that no animals were harmed in the making of these burgers!! I will def make these again and might increase the spices a little more. Thank you Eveningstar24!!! Update: Just made these again from the leftovers in the freezer. We put them whole wheat wraps with lettuce onion cheese and the authentic thousand island dressing from this site Best ever! We have dubbed them Big Mac Bean Wraps. Introduced this to some newcomers and it was a huge hit with them as well. Am now making more as my left overs are gone. I'm actually making a double batch because it's so handy in the freezer! I store it in an old sour cream 16oz containers and each one is enough to make burgers for 5. Might try a bbq sauce ensemble next...",

It was good and both of my picky eaters aged 2 and 4 enjoyed it. If you are concerned about sodium I would sub your own spices for the seasoned stuffing mix and be sure to rinse the beans before you let them drain to get rid of any extra starch. Your stomach will thank you later. I have seen other recipes where they didn't process or blend the beans and they just fell apart.",
