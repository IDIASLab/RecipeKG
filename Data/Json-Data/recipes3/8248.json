I followed the recipe and my family loved the different textures with the soft biscuits, perfectly cooked vegetables and creamy sauce. This is a very hearty dish. I seasoned with salt and pepper through all the steps and used the full TBS of tarragon. The one comment that was consistent with everyone was that it was a little bland with the minimal seasonings and herbs. I have added this to our \"Sunday Dinner\" rotation and will tweak it a little with more seasonings. Thanks for sharing!",
