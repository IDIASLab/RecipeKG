I used about 24 stuffing mushrooms to use up all that stuffing. Because the mushrooms weren't precooked before adding the stuffing as some of my other stuffed mushrooms recipes call for the mushrooms released a lot of water during the cooking process. There was a lot of very unappetizing brown liquid sitting at the bottom of the pan once they were done. That liquid also really watered down the flavor of the stuffing. I had tried the stuffing before baking the mushrooms and I thought it was excellent. After they baked though the stuffing was quite bland. Maybe prebaking the mushrooms and possibly adding some breadcrumbs to the stuffing to help absorb more liquid would help but I don't think I will bother to try these again. There are definitely better stuffed mushroom recipes out there.",

Froze the leftovers to stuff chicken later. I reduced the baking time to 12 minutes since the caps were precooked. Served on a bed of parsley and it was pretty.... everyone gobbled them up!!

I'm thinking that maybe subbing cream cheese for the ricotta would help the flavor as well as the texture as ricotta tends to be grainy.
