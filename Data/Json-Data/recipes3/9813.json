Although I'm not sure what coconut palm sugar is so I just used regular granulated sugar. I didn't have the pepita seeds on hand so I subbed sunflower seeds. The next time I make this I will have the pumpkins seeds for the recipe. Served this with grilled Hawaiian brat patties 'Summer Corn Salad' and 'Greek Deviled Eggs' both from AR. Thanks Sarah O for sharing your recipe. We really enjoyed it.",
