Once the cake cools, top it with the cool whip and then top that with the toffee bars crunched up (Heath & Skor bars seem to work very well).  This is by far the one recipe that I pass along the most--it's awesome!",

It makes a dense cake so it won't get soggy (like everyone complained) and brings out the flavor of the chocolate. After baking I poked holes in the cake with a chopstick (not to the bottom of the pan), poured a jar of caramel over the top at room temperature (I omitted the milk completely because I didn't want it to be soggy)and poured chocolate syrup over the caramel. I broke up two Heath bars and put those on top. Next layer was cool whip and two more candbars. For presentation I added chocolate syrup stripes. It looked great, the cake didn't fall apart and everyone LOVED. Serve immediatley. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet but sweet enough! I love sweets and this was perfect. I'll make it again and again!",

The changes I made were poking holes in the cake with the back of a wooden spoon instead of making slits...and I used the whole 14 oz. can of condensed milk and doubled the amount of caramel topping....seems like a lot...but it soaks in and makes like a sauce for this cake. Used lite cool whip and pre-packaged chocolate covered toffee pieces. Great flavor...took this to friends house for dessert and everyone loved it.",

My recipe, however, uses the full can of sweetened condensed milk (not heated), followed by a full 15-16 oz. jar of slightly warmed ice cream topping (I like Mrs. Richardson's butterscotch-caramel) Having raised both a son and a daughter, I can tell you that it seems that boys go even more crazy over this dessert than the girls, but maybe that's only because the girls were more concerned about their waistlines!  :) This is outrageously gooey and good, combining two favorite flavors, chocolate and caramel.",

After making it the first time, I have found that the whipping cream seems to detract from the chocolate/carmamel flavor of the cake, so I don't use it. If you want to cut down on some of the sweetness then the whipping cream is not a bad idea. It adds to the presentation as well, but definitely not necessary. I also have found that it is much easier  to microwave the caramel mixture. Try not to use the stove. It can burn easily. Excellent cake!!",

I poked the holes with a wooden spoon all the way to the bottom and used a full 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed milk and a 12 oz. jar of caramel ice cream topping.  I poured in half of each and then repeated the process.  I also used an 8 oz. bag of Heath bits.  I made the cake a day ahead as suggested and added the whipped topping and garnish just prior to serving.  I wasn't totally impressed with the cake until my husband had a leftover piece a day later.  By that time the liquids had been evenly absorbed into the cake and you could taste the caramel, which we couldn't when it was originally served.  So, the secret to developing the best flavor and texture is to make it TWO days in advance.  Just cover it tightly and put it in the refrigerator.  Trust me, you won't be sorry.  It improves with age.",
