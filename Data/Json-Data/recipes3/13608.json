The only problem with that is the onion doesn't cook completely so I would suggest either very finely mincing the onion, or saut\u00e9ing it with the tomatoes and spinach. I also found it easier to slice the breasts horizontally into two pieces each, instead of pounding them down into two huge breasts. This smells AMAZING when it's cooking and I'd gladly serve this to company!",
