I followed the recipe closely and made no changes other than adding a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of baking powder. There might be a little too much molasses and I'd cut back on the yogurt next time. I even \"soaked\" the wheat germ and oats in the wet ingredients before folding in the dry. Good starting point for me to play with and try again. I think it has potential. NOTE: For me this made more than twelve servings. I got 12 regular sized muffins and 12 mini muffins. Not a huge deal but when the recipe wasn't as successful it's a huge bummer.",

Because I used Greek yogurt the dough turned out really thick so I had to add half a cup of soy milk to make it workable. Which meant I then had to add 1/4 tsp baking powder too. The only other modification I made it was add half cup of raisins and half cup of walnuts instead of a full cup of raisins.",
