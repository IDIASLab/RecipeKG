The smokey flavor of the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce adds a nice \"kick\" to it.  You can adjust the spice level of the dish by increasing or decreasing the amount of peppers. You should be able to find the peppers (canned) in the Mexican aisle of your supermarket.  These grits were wonderful, easy to make, and I'm having them with my lunch again today.  This is a keeper!\n**UPDATE** I made this again only I was pressed for time and didn't have any chiles on hand this time, and I also only needed 4 servings instead of 12 so this is what I did:  I adjusted the servings to 4, used Quaker quick grits and instead of the amounts of broth and milk in the recipe, I used the chart on the grits container for 4 servings in the stovetop directions. I used half broth, half milk.  I saut\u00e9ed the onion first, then added the chipotle with adobo to the onion and continued to saut\u00e9.  I didn't have any green chiles on hand but I would have added them at the same time as the chipotle. Then I added the broth and milk and brought it to a boil and then turned it down to low and whisked in the grits and cumin, salt and pepper.  Covered and cooked for 5 minutes while I shredded the cheddar cheese.  I added all the cheese to the sauce pan and stirred it around until it was melted and the grits were creamy and done just like that.  I didn't put it in the oven to bake, didn't have ti",

I finally decided to find a recipe and see what kind of flavor grits can have. I'm so glad to have found this recipe! I followed the reviewer recommendations of cutting back on the salt (I used 1 tsp instead of 2) and I used 1 tsp of cumin instead of 1tbsp. I also used 2 chipotle peppers instead of 4 and 'mild' green chilies. So good so creamy so cheesy! I think you could easily omit the baking step. They were just as tasty right out of the pot. A perfect blend of flavors. I served these with smoked pulled pork and corn from my garden. A keeper!",
