(I\u2019ve made converts of those who are suspicious of garlic in scrambled eggs!)  Today I had no mozzarella, so Cheddar filled in and I always prefer using butter in this instance rather than olive oil.  I also prefer the tomatoes sliced and on the side rather than in the eggs, but it\u2019s good either way.  This is a breakfast you can eat and feel you\u2019ve done your body good (as opposed to the ever and always delicious and tempting pancakes, Belgian waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, coffee cake, biscuits and sausage gravy, French toast, donuts, stratas, hash browns, cinnamon rolls, etc.)",

He doesn't care for onions or mushrooms and I didn't have garlic, so I omitted those and used about 1/8 tsp of garlic pepper in place of the salt. Seemed like a lot of oil; I used non-stick spray instead. Had shredded cheddar jack on hand, so subbed it in for the mozzerella. Used 4 extra large eggs minus one yolk, and it yielded more than the two of us could finish. So good, and it does look fancy!",
