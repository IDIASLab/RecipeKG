        "description": "I love crepes, but I'm gluten free, and I thought I'd never enjoy them again. Good news is, the original crepes are made with buckwheat flour, which is gluten free. I like them but they take overnight preparation, and as a mother of young kids, sometimes I just want to do something quick, so I tried sweet white sorghum flour, and the result was a light batter that holds great, and has soft texture and mild flavor. Excellent to make sweet or savory crepes. Stuff them with ham and cheese, chicken and your favorite sauce, smoked salmon, beef strips, veggies, eggs, or fruit and yogurt. Let your imagination inspire you.",

I ended up needing to add a couple of tablespoons of water to thin out the batter. A half batch made six crepes (1/4 cup of batter each). I served them with a mascarpone and sweet ancho chili filling. These were a perfect starter for our dinner. Thank you for the recipe.",
