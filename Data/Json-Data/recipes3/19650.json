I served them with shredded cheddar cheese and they were out of this world.  The diced tomatos added moisture--I noticed people had complained about these being too dry.  They turned out perfect!

I really don't like cilantro so I left that out.  I minced FRESH garlic myself for this recipe, and added chili powder as another reviewer suggested.  The black bean, cream cheese, onion and pepper mixture was very attractive and appetizing, but I found it needed quite a bit more salt than called for.  I added a little rice to each burrito, to make it more filling, and put a few teaspoons of medium chunky salsa in each as well.  I doubled everything in the recipe and made six burritos to freeze for my husband's lunches.  With the addition of the rice it would have stretched to about 10 burritos, but I followed another reviewers advice and saved some of the bean mixture for a dip.",

Instead of chopped garlic, I sprinkled in some granulated garlic, (approx 1/2 tsp.) and only used about 1/2 the amount of cream cheese called for. I used refried black beans since that's what I had on hand and added a handful of blended italian cheese since I had some in the fridge.  I zapped my tortillas in the microwave...was too lazy to use the oven.  I really enjoyed these with a tall glass of diet coke... (i'm sure someone has enjoyed this with a beer or two..hehe).
