I cut the eggs in large chunks and then squished it with a fork some, still chunky. I don't care if it is pink from the paprika, this salad is wonderful!  Thank you for sharing.",

Certainly add the mayonnaise to taste - what's not enough for one person might be more than enough for another -but not one tablespoon. Other than that this isn't bad for a basic egg salad - the dill and Dijon are very nice additions.  However, I didn't use the paprika.  I tried that once in another recipe and didn't like it; it gave the egg salad an unbecoming color.  I coarsely chopped rather than mashed the eggs, as the idea of mashed eggs didn't appeal to me.  For a little less bite and a lot more color I added chopped green onion rather than the red.  I also mellowed out the tang of the mayonnaise (I did use considerably more than the amount directed) by adding a dollop of sour cream.  Last but not least, I tossed in some celery, as in my mind no egg salad is complete without it.",
