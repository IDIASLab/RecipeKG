I did most of the recipe as written but added fresh baby spinach leaves and some artichoke hearts. It was delicious. You have to be aware that there is no sauce/gooey cheese to hold it all together and eat it more carefully but it's a tiny inconvience compared to the yummy taste. Some other toppings I'm considering for next time are marinated mushrooms sun dried tomatoes and different kinds of olives. Crispy crumbled bacon would also be good on this!",
