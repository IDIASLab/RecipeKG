Nice to see a healthy way to perk up cauliflower - I usually just steam it, and I try to avoid the cheese sauces that so frequently go along with cauliflower.  This is easy and delicious.  The only change I would make is to just toss the oil and garlic with the cauliflower in a bowl instead of the bag, as some of the garlic bits got stuck to the inside of the bag and it was a pain to scrape them out.  Otherwise a perfect, healthy recipe!  It is even delicious cold (couldn't stop picking at it after dinner...)  Thank you for sharing!",

I only used about 1/4 c of parmesan cheese, which seemed like enough. I used Kraft Parm Plus so it has garlic, basil, and some other stuff in it and it was VERY tasty, but I think regular parmesan would be just fine. I also added about 1/4c. of italian breadcrumbs. This was so easy and tasty, I will definitely make this again. Oh, after reading about some people haveing problems with burning garlic, I kept the dish covered with foil for the first half of cooking. And I didn't find it undercooked at all; I thought it was perfectly cooked.",

I used about 1.5 TBS olive oil and 4 large cloves of garlic. I added the whole bag of cauliflower frozen which congealed the oil, but I was still able to get it all covered. It was ready in less than 20 minutes and was very good and very easy. I'll try it with fresh next time to see if it is worth the difference in time and money.
