I also used 6 oz. clam juice and 4 oz. white wine then reduced before adding 1/4 c. cream.

First, I scaled the recipe to two servings; I reduced the olive oil to 2 generous Tbsp and used the correct amount of butter; I added a large(ish) shallot along with 3 cloves of garlic.  Once this was softened in the oil, I added the clam juice and the shrimp and scallops and cooked them *almost* through.  I removed the seafood and reduced the remaining liquid by half (the seafood gave off quite a bit of liquid).  Then I added about 1/4 cup of 10% cream; added the seafood back to the pan along with the rest of the ingredients (I used about 1/3 cup chopped, dried sundried tomatoes which I'd rehydrated in some water) and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  I poured this over the pasta and added a grating of fresh parmesan cheese.  The end result was absolutely delicious! It would also be a good dish to serve to company.",

I made it as described with the addition of 1/4 c half and half to give the sauce a little more body.  It was scrumptious!  My husband stopped mid-first bite, looked up at me, chewed, swallowed, and said reverently, \"This is the BEST thing you have ever made.\"  We all (including 2 year old daughter and 4 year old son) thought it was wonderful.  Next time I will add a few more sundried tomatoes, but other than that, it is perfect, truly one of the best I've ever tried.  Thank you so much for sharing this easy but company-quality dinner dish.  Garlic bread for sopping up the sauce is a MUST!  YUM!",

Used fresh lemon basil in place of the zest and that gave it a fresh flavor but I can see it being brighter with the zest. I'll try it again the right way and leave a final review.",
