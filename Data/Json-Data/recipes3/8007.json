I kept the other measurements the same (1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire & 1/4 c. beer). There's never a shortage of beer in this house so we used Michelob Ultra. I think any type of full bodied beer will work fine in this recipe. Instead of a tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. of pepper I used 1 & 1/4 tsp. of McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning. After mixing the ground beef we let it set for a half hour in the fridge before making the patties to let the flavors come together. These burgers came out very moist and juicy -perfect on a toasted sesame seed roll with melted cheese lettuce and tomato.",

I used 93/7 ground turkey instead of beef, the meat mixture did seem very thin and I was worried that these wouldn't hold together well on the grill so I added about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.
