When I use pink, I add red food coloring to the mix, and when I use regular lemonade, I put yellow food coloring in the mix, it gives the dessert such a pretty color, I also cut lemon really thin, cut it halfway to the center, then pinwheeled it back and set it in the center, so pretty!!!

I like sweet and was only able to eat a small piece because of how rich it was...which at Christmas time is probably for the best anyhow. The reason I gave it only three stars is because it was very loose. I made it exactly as the recipe instructed but it doesn't really set up the way I felt it should. I will make it again because it was tasty but I will probably take out 8oz of the S&C milk and replace it with 8oz whipped cream cheese. I think those flavors would be equally as appealing and it would set up more like a dessert and less like a no cook pudding.",

I do not find it overly sweet at all......Never had it runny and for sure never had it rejected at all by family or freinds. I have made it approximately 15 times without any issues.

I used NO sugar in the crust, and I added an 8 oz brick of cream cheese to the filling as suggested by another reviewer (but did not reduce the amount of sweetened condensed milk). The taste is really unusual & excellent. If I had the freezer space I'd freeze it and try it that way :)EDIT: 6/19/09: Made this again without sugar in crust, but this time didn't have a brick of cream cheese. It's very good even without (my recommended) brick of cream cheese. Be SURE you notice that your can of lemonade is probably 12 oz (not 6). I noticed this time, but did NOT notice originally--makes it much more tart if you have accidentally doubled the lemonade! (But tasty either way.)",

The party that I tried it for is tonight Cinco de Mayo. I know my guests will love it. It will be refreshing treat after all of the spicy Mexican food I will be serving.

I would love to try this one again but am wondering if anyone can clarify the ingredients for me? Maybe I made a mistake. 1/ I used Minute Maid frozen lemonade concentrate. Should I have used an unsweetened concentrate? 2/ Sweetened condensed milk is only sold here in 300ml (apx 8.5 oz) tins so I had to use almost 2 tins to make up 14oz as specified in the recipe. Is this the correct amount of s.c. milk? Any advice would be appreciated!",
