This is a great dish, and filling even without the chicken, a great meatless meal.  To the person who commented that they couldn't believe it didn't have \"curry\"...  Curry powder is a mixture of spices of widely varying composition based on South Asian cuisine. Curry powder, and the contemporary English use of the word curry are Western inventions and do not reflect any specific Indian food.  So the fact that this has a spice mixture can make it a curry.",

Curry powder as we think of it is actually a blend of spices that is used in Indian cooking.  This blend often includes cumin, coriander and turmeric which this recipe does have listed as ingredients.  Thai curries use fresh or dried chilis, ginger, galangal, lemongrass and coriander among other things to make a fresh curry paste.  That said, I'm sure you could make this into a delicious Indian-style curry by adding curry powder to your liking.",

Another good addition might be chickpeas but overall a very good recipe that will be added to our rotation. I didn't have chicken but I added bits of tofu and that worked very well.
