Followed the recipe exactly but as advised by other members did add the seasoning packet. We presented it with a teriyaki burger with thousand island dressing made with homemade ketchup and a spring mix. We picked a container that was about the same size and shape as the patty we were going to make. Line first with plastic wrap place a small amount of noodles then more plastic wrap. Weighted it down and placed in the refrigerator for about an hour. They cooked up perfectly. Not even the 3 minutes called for. We fried ours in EVOO with some garlic. Mahalo for such a great recipe!",

Instead of Beef I used ground pork to make the patties I added a little salt and onion to the patties. I did not use soy or sesame oil. I generally only use a tiny bit of sesame oil when stir frying but I find that it can make a recipe go wrong if you are heavy handed. So After making the noodles and putting them in the cups I put them in the fridge for a few minutes before frying this worked great to help the shape set. As for the sauce I used hoison with a bit of chili. The pork patties egg cheese and hoison blended nicely and the ramen buns brought all the flavors together. This will be a new favorite late night snack at our house.",
