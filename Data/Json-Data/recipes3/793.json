I added more milk because 5 oz. didn't seem like it would have been enough to hold this together. I started out trying to dip the \"bars\" into the chocolate and found out that if they are not set...it makes a big mess. So I rolled them into balls and had better success that way. Make sure your chocolate isn't too thick...this will make it harder to coat. When all was said and done...these were a hit!! Thanks Debi.",

I did make one change: instead of pressing into a pan and cutting the chilled slab into bars I rolled the coconut mixture into a log and then cut into pieces. When dipping I turned the bar over to coat completely and this made a beautiful swirl over the top of each candy. Note: I did use my hands to mix in the coconut. I amy have used a bit more confectioners' sugar than called for. The mixture was very stiff and this may have made it easier to dip the pieces in chocolate.",

One of my hubby's favorite candies is \"Mounds\" so I tried this recipe so he can still have them. He loves them! they are a bit time consuming but the kids love helping make them it turned out to be a great rainy day project! We rolled them into balls then mushed and flattened them into kind of flat egg-shapes. I put them close together on a wire rack (placed over a jelly roll pan to catch drips) then carefully poured melted cocolate over them. I transfered the rack onto another pan then chilled for about 5 min to set the cocolate. then re-melted the \"drippings\" and dipped the bottoms in one at a time and let them set again. I reccomend using plastic food safe gloves over your hands if your hands tend to be hot like mine so you don't melt the chocolate that is already on them. For my husband he likes extra chocolate so i re-dipped a few in chocolate for him to give it an extra thick coat. since the candies already had a cocolate \"crust\" i didn't have any trouble dipping at all. We will definately make this again and again! Thank you for posting it!",
