I'm pretty picky about my BBQ sauce and I have 2-3 different recipes on rotation that I make from scratch. That said I love trying new interesting recipes and this fit the bill. Not only did I have all the ingredients I try to follow a low-carb diet so this was a win-win! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I was tempted to add in a few drops of liquid smoke (like I do with my other fave BBQ sauce recipes) but I resisted and thought the flavor was fabulous. I grilled up some chicken breasts and brushed this on in the last few minutes of grilling. This would also be excellent on grilled shrimp! Looking forward to experimenting with different meats. Love the bright color too! Thank you Nicole for this fabulous recipe!",
