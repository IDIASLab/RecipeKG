This is the real thing. \n\nWarning: zip sauce needs to be used only by real men and real women. If you're in doubt about what side of the fence you're on, you're in for a rough ride with this sauce. This is not something you want to just pour on your polite little ribeye. It will refuse to be placed on anything less than a 1.25\" thick strip sirloin-- butcher shop stuff-- forget Kroger. Whatever you do, do not put a California freakin' vegetable medley anywhere near this sauce. It'll chase it off the plate, and then turn around and come after you. About the only thing it will tolerate on the same plate is a baked Idaho potato.\n\nA wine selection: screw the wine. This sauce demands Scotch, neat. Although I have heard of some folks doing this sauce with a stiff Manhattan. Make sure you do two good ones while the steak is grilling , and then gun down the third before your first bite. You'll be channeling Hunter S. Thompson and Rodney Dangerfield before you wrestle the dog for the last scrap of fat. After you pick yourself off the floor, THEN you can talk about wine.\n\nAfterwards, sweep the dishes off the table and grab your partner by the hair and show her what real men and real women do. She'll understand and be ready.",

I do have a friend who worked at 2 of the restuarants that serve the zip sause and he WILL NOT give out the recipe but he will make it at home when entertaining. The closest thing I've come to is actually buying the pre packaged Zip Sauce at the local Grocer you can find it at many of the small Detroit Grocer's mine Fresh Approach in Royal Oak. Although there are different versions of the recipe one is gravy like and the other isn't I perfer mine the thicker gravy like version I will add Wondra flour mixed with water to the Zip Sauce I bought and mix until desired consistency.",
