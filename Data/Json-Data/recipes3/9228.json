Out of all the recipes I have tried this one is the best! 5 minutes per side is acceptable timewise for me but still takes a while and is obviously just the nature of a paleo pancake. I followed the recipe with these changes: I used about triple the amount of almond milk and scooped a 1/4 measuring cup about half filled into a non-stick skillet oiled with coconut oil. I gently smooshed them flatter with the bottom of the measuring cup. I was able to get three 3 inch pancakes per batch for a total of 9. I added 1/2 cup of pumpkin along with the listed spices plus a bit of pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg plus a tiny smidge of cloves. I used baking powder instead of soda in the same amount listed. Topped with maple syrup and had sausage links to round out my paleo lunch. Taste and texture were wonderful! I would definitely make these yummy cakes again!",

I didnt have cloves so I used nutmeg and it was good. I also used coconut milk instead of almond milk. I agree that it really needs alot more liquid they were way too thick. I also use coconut oil to cook them in and coconut oil on top of them instead of butter. If you dont really expect them to taste like normal pancakes you will like them as a yummy breakfast treat.",
