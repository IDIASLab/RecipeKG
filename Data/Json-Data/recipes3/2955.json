Cut back on the cayenne a bit but it was still plenty. Maybe because I didn't thaw the corn the batter came out thicker but I used a small ice cream scoop to pop them in the fryer. Wow! Lots of flavor pretty easy recipe and reheated in a hot oven like a charm. Will make again and again.",

                "reviewBody": "This was really good! I made it as close to the recipe as I could. The only changes I had to make were I used 1/2 c re-hydrated minced onion (my red onion was well past it's prime) and only 1/2 T cayenne pepper (learned from a previous experience that 1 T is WAY to much for my family). The ham and corn had a nice sweet contrast to the savory spice of the dough. Keeping the oil at temp is important to avoid a dense beignet. (funny I didn't know beignet was French for fritter or fried dough. I looked it up since the first thing my hubby said was \"That's a fritter.\"). I used a cookie scoop to drop it into the oil and found that the more horizontal I could get the scoop the better the batter came out. This is going to make a big batch for my family of 4 so I'm going to try to freeze the cooked ones and reheat in the oven and see how that turns out. UPDATE: Freezing them turned out great. Thaw in fridge and bake at 350 until warmed through and crispy. Will make again possibly with crab meat in 1/2 batch and andoulle in the other (sans pepper for this). Now to find a great dipping sauce.",

Out of the oil they're crispy the next day they are chewy. They definitely need more flavor in my opinion. I added cheese half way through because I thought they were bland and that made a big difference. I had also made an artichoke dip and they taste good dipped in that also. They taste like \"hush puppies.\" This made a huge batch and I finally threw the last of them away. We aren't really crazy about fried foods and didn't like the greasy feel. I won't make these again. It needs a little more \"something.\" Overall okay easy recipe. Just wasn't our taste.",
