In any event roasted red peppers is my favorite type of hummus. I couldn't find the tahini so I ground up sesame seeds in my spice mill... and trust me... I looked ALL over my local grocery store looking for tahini to no avail. Of course this afternoon I found it... in the peanut butter aisle... DUH! Anyway the recipe turned out great... tasted EXACTLY like the container I pay 6 for at the store. Oh and I took a reviewers advice and while rinsing the beans I rubbed them together in my hands and the skins came right off. Skimmed them right off the top of the water before tossing them in the food processor.",
