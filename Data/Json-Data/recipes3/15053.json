        "description": "I have been paleo for 3 months and discovered I couldn't enjoy my favorite breakfast...pancakes. I was temporarily relieved when I found paleo pancake recipes, but was disappointed because I couldn't find one that would stay together when flipped, didn't have a real eggy flavor, and had the mouthfeel of a real wheat pancake. I experimented and it took 4 tries, so I call it pancake V4. These pancakes stay together and have the texture you are looking for.",
