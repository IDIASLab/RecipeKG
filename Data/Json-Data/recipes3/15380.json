(e.g. coffee grounds, mint extract, cinnamon, white chocolate coating, etc.) Deliciously dark and fudgy! Enjoy with family on holidays, or just any time you have a major dark chocolate craving! Rolling in coating of choice before refrigerating, if desired.",

It should still be \"sticky\" enough for your choice of coating to adhere to the truffle. *UPDATE* Someone reviewed it who said they couldn't get the right consistency while in the fridge. I will add that you HAVE to stir it a couple times while it's in there.  So sorry I didn't put that at first, and I hope no one else will have problems with it.",

I didn't add the optional espresso powder as I felt it would be too strong for my taste. also the type of baking chocolate was not specified...there is more than one kind, I went with the normal unsweetened and it turned out amazing! also...after cooling for a while in fridge I scooped out approximately the amount for each ball and let them cool in fridge on baking sheet...then took it out a bit later to shape them more.

When I chilled the mix the outer layer hardened completely while the middle stayed a soupy mess. I finally had to put both hands in to make small balls of goop. I dropped each into a muffin paper (next time find candy size). For toppings I used sprinkles coconut honey roasted peanuts peanut butter orange liqueur slivered toasted almonds craisins raisins & powdered sugar. If you can figure out how to make this recipe manageable for you it will easily become your go-to favorite. Big Valentines Day hit - but wow give yourself time to figure out the best technique. Here's hoping everyone else has more success because these really do taste better than anything I've ever bought at a candy counter.",

I put all of the ingredients in a large pyrex measuring cup and heated in the microwave for 2 or 3 minutes stirring every 30 sec. until the chocolate was melted and the mixture was smooth. I skipped the 1st refrigeration step and just poured the molten chocolate into candy papers (mini baking cups) then put those in the frig for a couple of hours. Next time I will sprinkle on some nuts or sprinkles before I refrigerate them and I will also try with a single pecan on top and maybe some mint extract in the recipe.",

We let it refrigerate over night before we scooped it into balls that morning; it worked better than waiting just an hour (we were opening the refrigerator more than necessary). We used a melon baller for the general shape and then used our fingers to make them more uniform. Then we wiped our fingers with a paper towel before rolling them in pecans and coconut so they would look lovely for Mom.
