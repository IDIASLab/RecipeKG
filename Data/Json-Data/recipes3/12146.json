I usually use monkfish, which has a lobster-like flavor but you can use any white meaty fish, even tilapia. It takes about 30 minutes from start to finish. Serve with your favorite white wine, rice pilaf, and roasted asparagus.",

The combo of the soup cream cheese and sherry creates this rich buttery flavor that melts in your mouth. It did get a little thick on me but other than that I have no complaints. I added real bacon bits to my plate (as seen in the photo) but it sure didn't need it and they will be left off next time. This is good enough to serve to company! Use real sherry though and not the cooking sherry.",

So I substituted Cream of Mushroom soup added a few sauteed mushrooms to the final presentation and substituted a soft herbed cheese that I had on hand. I followed the method exactly and the monkfish were so moist and flavorful -- perfectly cooked. I served them with the sauteed mushrooms and the sauce over top. The family raved about this meal. That's a 5 star result in my book. Update: The second time I made this recipe I did use Cream of Shrimp soup and continued as written. (I even used a modest amount of cream cheese to thicken it but it did alter the flavor to the point where my husband did not care for it. ) Everyone in my family much preferred the Mushroom sauce but this is a wholly subjective point.",

I did find the sauce to be too thick as written so I added some heavy cream to thin it out. I also cut some grape tomatoes in half and added them to the sauce at the end along with some Cajun seasoning and black pepper. The finished sauce reminded me of a tomato/vodka sauce I have made before. Chicken stock could be used in place of cream to thin the sauce as well. A good base recipe that I will probably experiment with again!",
