My tortellini came out a bit soft and lacked flavor so next time I will cook it less and mix it in with the chicken/pesto mix  in the bowl rather than place the chicken/pesto on top of the tortellini.  Also, there are plenty of homemade pesto recipes in here and so simple - so try these rather than the pesto in a jar.  This was great and easy!",

I also used 2 lbs of chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts (since that's what I had) and I also used a can of diced tomatoes (drained the juices) instead of chopping up a real one because I'm a Mom of 4 and like to save time ?? I used 10 ounces of pesto sauce since I was starting with a bit more chicken and slightly more pasta than the recipe calls for. My family absolutely LOVED this and gobbled it right down! The lemon juice really enhances the flavor and this is something we will DEFINITELY make again!",
