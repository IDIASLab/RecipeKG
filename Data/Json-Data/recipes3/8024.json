Our garlic scapes (sprouts) are long matured by now so used \"mexican\" onion which is like a green onion but with a big bulb and some sliced regular garlic and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top to serve. Will look forward to trying it next spring with frozen chard stems and the actual garlic scapes. Thanks for the idea.",
