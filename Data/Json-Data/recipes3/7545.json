I adjusted the amount of rice vinegar up (to approx 1/4 c) and the amount of honey down (to 1 tbsp) and I felt that imparted the right amount of tart with sweet for myself. Bf however was not impressed so I'll make him the recipe as is. To be fair I'm not a sweet pickle fan--I'll eat them (I LOVE pickles) but I love dill--the more sour and tart the better. So I have to say I wouldn't like the recipe as is. Bf however may so I will make it again to see what he thinks. 3/30/11: I remade this dish adhering more closely to the recipe (I didn't measure--was too lazy). I felt they were too sweet for me but bf liked them. He said they weren't too tart for him. I think what people need to know is this: he LOVES bread and butter pickles and isn't a huge fan of vinegar. I think if you have similar tastes to bf you will like these. If you are more a dill pickle tart fan these won't do it for you. Thanks for the recipe!",
