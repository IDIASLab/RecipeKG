I got this recipe from my sister whose husband gave it the name 'Romance Sauce',  when she cooked this with steaks he knew it was going to be a special night.  Serve the steaks with a green salad and a simple vinaigrette; this is an easy, romantic meal sure to impress the ladies!  You could easily substitute the beef stock with chicken and serve over chicken breasts if beef isn't your thing.",

I did use dried dill but kept everything else as written.  The photos I took show the recipe just like that.  When I went to serve it to my husband, though, I added a tablespoon of butter to the sauce, hoping to cut down on the vinegary taste.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm a total balsamic vinegar lover!  And I'm betting that the two tablespoons works great when using beef stock and beef of some sort with this recipe.  I'd suggest starting out with just one for the chicken alternative and seeing what you think.  I will try this again because I think it is a good, basic recipe.  Thanks!",
