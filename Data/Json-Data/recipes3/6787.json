I love them served room temperature with a cold beer on a summer day! You can also begin cooking the peanuts, then let them soak overnight, and continue cooking the next day. Serve hot or cold, and make sure you have plenty of napkins on hand because these are messy.",

For the seasoning, I poured 3/4 cup salt into a measuring cup and filled it up to the 1 cup line with garlic powder, garlic salt, mixed up salt, Emerils seasoning, and a little cayene pepper. \n\nI don't like them too mushy so I just let them boil for about 3 hours. The trick to the right degree of saltiness according to your taste is to let them soak in their brine after they boil, and taste one every 15 mins or so until they are the way you like them. I let them soak for about another hour. Then drain them and rinse because they're really messy otherwise. Then I dried them a little in handfuls with paper towels and put them in a big tuperware container.",

The onions and garlic in this recipe make them less salty but just as flavorful as the traditional boiled peanuts we have had. They were delicious! They are not difficult just a bit time consuming. I do suggest a good rinse before eating. The garlic and onion boil down to little bits that make eating them even messier. Just rinse them while they are draining in the collander and then enjoy! For those who haven't had boiled peanuts they have a texture similar to a bean - which isn't surprising as they are part of the legume family. They just aren't quite as soft as a cooked bean. Try them they are addictive!",
