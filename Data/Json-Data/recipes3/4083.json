I must have cut my potatoes too thin, because they only took about 20 minutes to bake.  I just flipped them over and placed under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp them up.  I also used too much oil.  I didn't bother to measure.  Next time I will use just enough to coat the potatoes.  I also used season salt rather than regular and I like them.  I think next time I will try some powdered ranch.",
