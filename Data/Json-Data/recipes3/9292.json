Green beans,biscuits,cornbread,greens,fried cabbage,ect....I don't cook with it as much now learning just how unhealthy it is for my family and myself,but now and then I do go with those yummy home cooked meals from way back.

The thing you have to keep track of is your heat. Your roux will never thicken on low, and if you don't increase your heat when you add the milk you will never get it to simmer, much less thicken. The act of bubbling is what makes it thicken. you will never be able to make this in 36 minutes on low heat. Increase your heat to medium, season to taste, and it works just fine.",

First, it calls for twice the milk needed and would be very runny made as stated. 2 cups is plenty, 2-1/2 if you like it thinner. Also, I have never cooked a roux longer than 3-5 minutes. The reviewer who complained of burnt bacon taste should try greatly reducing roux cooking time, and stir constantly. As a general rule for nice, thick sauces made with a roux (fried flour) you should use a ratio of 2 tbsp. fat to 2 tbsp. flour per 1 cup of liquid. Stir constantly and have patience!",

                "reviewBody": "This is the way I was taught to make it from a Southern grandmother.  We always use whole milk but when she was poor she cut it with water but it is much richer with whole.   I have even added a tablespoon of butter or a some dry coffee creamer. This is GREAT served over fresh summer tomatoes!  \nTips: This recipe is very forgiving so you can adjust.  Main thing is equal ratio of bacon fat to flour maybe more fat.  There has to be enough fat to fry the flour first without it drying or clumping. Frying the flour is what makes it taste so good. A heavy cast iron skillet also helps and fry on low and constantly stir. Have all ingredients ready before you start, it moves fast. When you go to add your milk, take it from the heat, this will help you blend it before it tries to thicken and will prevent clumps. For the one who said 4 cups is too much milk,  it is not. Just simmer a minute and it will thicken right up.If its just a single person you can add less it thickens faster. The longer it simmers with the milk the more flavor and 4 cups allows it to simmer.  This is usually served a bit on the thicker side but some people like it more thin like traditional gravy,again on low heat and ALWAYS STIRRING.   I don't add Salt until the end, some bacon is very salty and you don't need more salt. You can easily add salt as you eat it and pepper too.   Everyone doesn't like the pepper. Hope this helps someone.  Enjoy.",

But it does eventually thicken beautifully and makes a plentiful serving so I wouldn't say it's \"wrong\" exactly. It's just slower. If it tastes burnt you probably used burnt bacon grease it's not likely that the roux cooking time had anything to do with it - roux for gumbo cooks for nearly an hour before you add liquid and while it can burn 15 minutes is the correct amount of time to turn the roux a caramel brown.
