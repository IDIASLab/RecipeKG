The Master Omelettier's secret to a gorgeous and fluffy omelette is to cook covered on medium-low until the final step - adding cheese and broiling in the oven for 2 minutes, or until brown.  For the fearless cook and the adventurous eater, consider adding some smoked salmon flavored cream cheese. Enjoy with toast or fresh croissants. Bon appetite!",

Made this for lunch for just myself so I halved the recipe for 2 large eggs and I condensed what would've been alot of dirty dishes when preparing this by using my frittata pan to cook the bacon retaining some of the grease for then sauteeing all of the veggies (including the asparagus - saw no need to boil it 1st) and cooking it on med-lo finishing it off on the stovetop w/ the cheese rather than broiling as my pan wasn't ovenproof. (If I was making the full recipe for more than myself which I totally plan on doing b/c I loved this THAT much I'll use my larger oven-safe pan and not skip that final broil step.) These ingredients are just magical together. Yes I can see myself tossing in kale spinach zucchini bell pepper or whatever vegg is floating around the fridge but this particular combo w/ the nutmeg and mozzarella was scrumpdiddlidoodliumptious.",

I'm not used to cooking my veggies before adding them to the recipe because I like the fresher crisper taste but in this recipe it works. Also this is a very heavy omelette. This is thick enough that you could bake it as is and get yourself a nice quiche. I did not pick up on the flavor of the nutmeg but I'm sure it helped. The broiling was a new take on an omelette for me and it worked good for this recipe but I don't think I will do it on my normal omelettes. This is a lot of food for two omelettes and will satisfy most hungry men.",
