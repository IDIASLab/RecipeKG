Place the dumplings in the hot skillet  large side down and cook without turning 5 minutes until brown. get a nice tight fitting lid then drizzle a couple of TBLS of water into skillet and slap the lid on let cook for another 5 min or so... Oh Man! Make a nice spicy-sweet dipping sauce and you are rockin! serve em hot! Good luck keeping up with the demand!",

I really like this recipe and I love the flavor, filling, etc., plus it's easy to make and calls for stuff you have around the house.  BUT - when you steam them, YUCK!  The wrappers look gross, and they stick together, rip apart, etc.  That was what made this UNuseful to me.  Maybe this little piece of information will help:  when you steam these, you either need to space them apart so they are not touching, OR you need to oil the wonton wrapper (or egg roll wrappers, if you use bigger ones, like I did) so they won't stick.  I am excited to try this again.",

Plus there is a different dipping sauce for momos fry some cut tomatoes till the its kinda dry ( you might want to add some water in the pot to take the tomato stuck in the pot out ) and blend it with some fresh cilantro fried garlic chilies and salt to taste. Add some sesame seeds before blending to make the sauce a bit thick so that it sticks to the momos. If you go to some indian store you can buy some spices for momo to add flavor.",

Also for the dipping sauce I didn't have chile oil but did have hot chile paste so I used 2t vegetable oil and 1t chile paste. The only problem I had was steaming them. I had a lot of them and used egg roll wrappers instead of wonton -- the wrappers were really thin and stuck fast to the metal of the steamer tray and to each other. So they tasted good but kind of fell apart when I tried to take them out. I will experiment more with this (different folding method or cooking longer or cooking uncovered instead of covered) because the recipe was good enough for me to want more!",
