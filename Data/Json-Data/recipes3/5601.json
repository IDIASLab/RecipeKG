It was still great though, just strongly herbiferized.  The good news, however, is that the soup was perfect the next day, just what I'd hoped for.  I honestly think it compares to the celebrated name-sake chowder served in one of Ann Arbor's more swanky restaurants.",

I didn't use fennel see but instead used anise seed because it is essentially the same thing but can be purchased for much cheaper in the Mexican food isle. I also used a can of clams in place of one of the bottles of juice (again for financial reasons). I added the juice from the can and added the minced clams 2 minutes before serving. I also used sun dried tomatos packed in oil because I couldn't find the other kind at my home supermarket. Finally I added the zest of one mandarin orange at the same time as the other spices. This really added a lot to this delicious stew. My husband was really impressed =).",
