Couldn't believe it - but I had run out of regular curry powder and so used Garam Masala instead and this added a wonderful cinnamon taste to the dressing.  This was a really lovely dressing all on its own, but made spectacular by the fruit and spinach.  My 11 year old daughter couldn't get enough.  Will definately put this on my \"to make again\" list.",
