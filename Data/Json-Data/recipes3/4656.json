I made this two weeks ago and was rather apprehensive as to how it would turn out since it didn't look particularly appealing when the crumbs had browned sufficiently. But I was pleasantly surprised by how good it tasted though the lemon juice (2 tbsp) was a bit overpowering. Although I used 4 tbsp of mayonnaise the mixture of bread crumbs was rather dry but very crunchy. I used plain bread crumbs since I didn't have herb seasonsed ones 2 cloves of fresh garlic and a small onion. There weren't any leftovers. I made it again for tonight's dinner. This time I used 6 tbsp of mayonnaise 1 tbsp of lemon juice and 1 tsp of dried dill to the bread crumbs and the result was excellent. The taste was just right and yes no left overs. But I've discovered that on both ocassions it took 30 minutes for the fish to cook at 350 degrees F.",

I found the bread crumb mixture was too dry with the 2T of mayo so I added a little more as well as 2 tablespoons of lemon juice as it added just the right flavour to the fish.
