I would highly recommend DOUBLING the icing recipe. The icing is so good that \"more\" is better than \"less\"! I decorated the bottom of the cake with little alternating pastel mini marshmallows. Everyone thought it was so pretty! The next time I make it I am going to put crushed pinneapple between the two layers of cake. Note: The cakes gets even better with time...refridgerate and you will enjoy this all week long!",

There is no hiding the fact that this is a BOX cake. You will have a hard time convincing most people that this is made from scratch. The topping I used 2 cups of whipped heavy whipping cream instead of the dream whip. Added coconut and the pudding then sweetened to taste. Now this topping may be a keeper with a homemade cake. Otherwise won't make the box cake portion again.",

It was called Watergate Cake because it had such a great cover-up (as you see reviewers loved the topping). In the old days people were just starting to add oil to cake mixes and this one has a lot and certainly could be cut back now! Just made it again after many years for a Christmas lunch and its green color looked very appropriate. I would recommend that you use the dream whip for the topping instead of coolwhip although the cool whip would certainly be a time saver. In the old days it HAD to be made in a bundt or tube pan as in the photo. Much more impressive although the 9x13 versions are certainly easier to deal with and take to a picnic etc. Still a delicious dessert!",

That being said does not change the fact that this cake is in need of help. I notice that many if the recipes that are giving it 4-5 stars talk about adding ingredients. I would say adding some crushed pineapple and maybe walnuts to the batter and/or the topping are required to make this worth your time. Also its a must to double the topping there is just simply not enough to frost the cake.",
