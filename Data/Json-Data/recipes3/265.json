I cooked the bacon 1/2 way in the microwave & then put it in the pot and sauteed the onion with it to cook it through then took it out & cut it up. Since I have not seen ranch style beans since I was in Texas in 1995 and because I thought this was going to be like maybe campbells bean & bacon soup I decided to wing it and use pork & beans (ha). I also had (left over from another recipe) 1/2 can of tomato sauce & 1/2 can of tomato paste that I had mixed together & used that. I did manage to use the regular chicken broth and added a little water (due to the addition of the paste). Over all it was pretty good not exactly like any canned bean & bacon that I've had but it went together well with grilled cheese. Thanks Lyndell.",
