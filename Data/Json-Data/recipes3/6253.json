I had to drain my browned meat (I used 90% lean ground beef), then added the oil and veggies so the liquid wouldn't soak the rolls too much later on.\n\nI tested a small-ish slice of Sharp Cheddar cheese in half of them, but with the thin slices I used, you can't tell the difference - so I'd leave it out next time since it's not neccessary, and probably more healthy.\n\nTruly, I am going to make these for work lunches once in a while, they're a lot better than plain old sandwitches or worse, canned/microwave food.\n\nThanks for posting it!!!",

I almost doubled the s&p, added garlic powder and worch. sauce and about 7C cabbage.  Drained the fat from the meat before adding the cabbage, and again after it wilted and released water.  Filling turned out GREAT.  Not greasy, and didn't make the dough mushy.  Will use the recipe again with additions, but I think it needs the sweeter home made dough.  These will still go fast!\nUpdate:  I froze these UNBAKED.  Heat oven to 350 while letting Runza sit on counter/baking pan.  Bake for 30 min when oven is at temp. Do not thaw more than that. Perfect!",

I used a whole bag of prepackaged coleslaw mix added some garlic salt and Worchestershire sauce as others have recommended and it turned out great. I pressed out one biscuit to about a 6-inch circle added a generous heap of filling and placed another pressed-out biscuit on top. Sealed the edges and rolled them under to keep from bursting. Placed on a cookie sheet and baked according to the directions on the roll package about 15 minutes. Total time from start to finish was about 35 minutes perfect for those busy weeknights. This approach will use half the recipe 16 biscuits (2 packages) making 8 portions about the size of a Kaiser roll. Will definitely make again!",
