I think they could benefit from a dash of cayenne for a kick but didn't mind dipping my bites into hot sauce. The recipe was easy to follow and while I prepared the last of our dinner I put the completed pancakes (about 8 min/side for my 3\" blobbies) in a 300 deg oven to keep warm.",

I made them once with thyme instead of rosemary when I was out and they were just as good. I ve also used yellow onion in one batch and red in another and they were also just as good. I use Seasonello herbal salt which is a mix of sea salt rosemary garlic sage and pepper and add some cayenne. I altered the measurements a bit to accommodate the portion I wanted. The following measurements yielded 6 good sized pancakes: 2 cups shredded parsnips (in my case that was 1 large parsnip) 3 eggs (beaten) 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 1 tsp Seasonello 1 tsp thyme or rosemary 2 Tbs olive oil cayenne and fresh ground pepper to taste. I fried mine in peanut oil 5 minutes each side on medium heat. These pancakes are delicious with sriracha and I d say they re actually best eaten cold the next day.",
