Also, I suggest removing the fat from the chicken first.  It's advisable to bring the chicken to a boil first in order to remove the scum (impurities) from the top of the pot.  You should remove as much scum as possible then add the vegetables.  This makes for a clearer stock.  I also add coarsly chopped celery leaves as they add a lot of flavour.  You can also add chopped parsley.  I cook up a big pot and freeze 2 cup portions for later use in cream soups, chowders and gravies.  You'll just need to add more salt after it defrosts.",

Just a note: it is not necessary to peel and/or chop your vegetables before adding them. Just wash them good and throw 'em in! (You're going to toss them in the end anyway.) You don't even have to peel your onion (the skin darkens the stock nicely). You can add any/all vegetables that are languishing in the vegetable bin to this stock. I freeze my stock in ice cube trays then pop them out and put them in freezer bags. You use just a little or a lot that way and there's no waste. Thanks for posting this Leah.",
