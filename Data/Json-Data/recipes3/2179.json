He said this is it!  The recipe is super simple, the longest part of preparation is opening the oysters!  He ate 6 & we froze the other 18 in three zip-loc bags. Next time, we'll just get them out of the freezer, sprinkle a few more breadcrumbs & grated cheese on top, then pop into the oven!  Wonderful!\r\nRobin Weiss in NC.",

I used \"Pernod\" that I bought to cook food from recipes I got on a cruise ship.(27.00 a bottle) I was thrilled I had this anise flavored alcohol for this recipe. I had everything on the recipe but oysters in the shell. I used a glass of fesh oysters from Costco.I cooked the oysters in a frying pan with olive oil and garlic than cooked spinach in sauce left in the pan. I want to try shell oysters next. I first had Oyster Rockefller at Jake's Fish House in Portland Oregon. This recipe is just as good and a whole lot cheaper. I would not change a thing but I would not use my Vita Mix blender next time since it made the mixture soupy. I will use my small Cuisnart to just chop the mix..",

I added garlic gloves and pepper corns to the pot.\n\nI used melted garlic butter, chopped spinache, onion, parma AND romano cheese with a dash of lemon juice. I then set them in the oven, broiling them on high for about 1 minute.\n\nI make this at least once a month and EVERYONE absolutely craves them!!!!",

Oh was he sceptical. He let me do my thing and I followed the recipe to a T. They were super easy to open. (though my food processor was at my place. Had to use the blender and it did puree. Not to worry...still fantastic) We both decided it was a 50 meal in some fancy restaurant. He says he will catch a lot more next time. we like the other reviewer's advice of freezing them.
