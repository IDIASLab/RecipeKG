Used water instead of broth, at least 1 cup in the end and a more flatter shaped pasta.  \r\nFinally it was cooked BBQ'd chicken that went in and the final result i must say was fantastic.  My boyfriend is a chef and he loved it, and inspired him for a new menu idea at his restaurant!!  Well done Holly :)",
