My biggest advice is to watch them closely in that final broiling step. At one minute they look like they are not browning at all but at two minutes they are slightly over as seen in my picture. Also be sure to use a slotted spoon while assembling your sliders or you will end up with soggy bread. These were fast, easy, and fun and would make a great snack for a tailgating party.",
