I followed the advice of others and cut the salt in half for the chicken rub. I also used a whole wheat pizza crust. Besides that the recipe is perfect. If you like mushrooms be sure to add those because it makes the pizza better. Thanks for this wonderful healthy pizza recipe! I am adding a note in here about the sogginess another reviewer mentioned - I always squeeze my salsa through a cloth or paper towel before spreading on pizza. Otherwise the excessive liquids leave the crust soggy and messy to eat!",

The chicken is fabulous with the spice combination. Because I was at a friend's house using a dull knife to chop the salsa ingredients I eventually used a food processor to aid in the process. I just spread the salsa on the crust and then topped with the chicken and the recommended cheese. I took the pizza to my gourmet group and it was consumed in a very short period of time. I did not think that there was a whole lot of heat produced by the ingredients-just a very flavorful combination. The crust was not soggy and I did not drain off any liquid from the salsa like some people did. All I can say is \"YUMMY\"!",

It calls for two yellow pear tomatoes but the only yellow pear tomatoes I'm familiar with are about the size of cherry tomatoes - so two would definitely not be enough for this recipe. I used two yellow Heirloom. In my opinion the seasoning can be reduced by half. My chicken was liberally covered and I only used half the seasoning. I like moderatly spicy foods but this was borderline too spicy for my tastes AND I only used half the cayenne called for and did not use the jalapenos! If I were to make it again I would incorporate all of the above changes and I would use a different cheese in lieu of the Pepper Jack. Thanks for sharing this recipe Sarah Stephan!",
