I first broiled the bread for 2-3 minutes. Ok i know this totally modifies the recipe but i had to use hot dogs instead of hot italian sausage 'cause that's what i had on hand but next time i'm using the hot sausage. Forgot about the black olives and increased the amount of dried oregano to 1/2 teaspoon. Also omitted the olive oil 'cause i wanted to reduce the fats and i'll tell you i didn't miss it. We had this for dinner yesterday night and we're still raving..... Thank you thank you thank you Diane your papa is a genius!",

                "reviewBody": "I really like this. Very simple to prepare and delicious. Also very filling. I was going to eat this with salad but the salad is on the bread! I was a bit flaky when I shopped for the ingredients as I ended up with fresh mozzarella instead of slices and regular sausage instead of hot. I also ended up with green olives with pimentos and looking back at the recipe I suppose it calls for just green olives. Anyway I really like the combo of flavors in this and am already thinking about how to make it less messy. It's kind of like an overtopped pizza or overstuffed sandwich--you can eat it with your fingers but everything keeps falling off. I like everything on this bread and I think you really have to because there are a lot of strong flavors! I like how it all goes together and I think that it would be wonderful to sub tapenade for the olives and toast the bread first so that you could put the tapenade the olive oil and balsamic sauce then the sausage and the remainder of the ingredients. I think it might make it a bit less messy and manageable. Of course part of it was my fault since I used fresh mozzarella and sliced it thicker than what purchased slices would be. Still the bread had a nice crunch on the bottom and I liked all the flavors together. I tossed on some diced orange bell pepper I had to use it up.",
