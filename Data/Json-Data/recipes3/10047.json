I made the dressing for Strawberry and Feta Salad by MSCHEF also on this site. The salad paired wonderfully with our grilled NY strip steaks.",

Everything is in the bottom of the bowl except for clumpy stuck together spinach. I mention it because I didn't expect it from the photos and I would have been sorely disappointed to serve this to guests.
