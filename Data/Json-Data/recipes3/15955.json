Fam thought the overall flavor was good personally thought too much vinegar but that may be I left them soaking for about an hour as I had to run out. My son and I couldn't decide about the consistency though. Yes a bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside but didn't quite come together as I thought it would. I made a double batch at once so maybe that's why they didn't come out as expected. Always willing to try something new so thanks for the recipe. Jury still out so not sure if I will make again.",
