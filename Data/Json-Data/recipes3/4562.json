It sounded kind of odd especially since I'm somewhat new to sauerkraut but I made it exactly as written and it turned out to be \"different\" but fairly tasty. I cooked the meat until 3:30 before cutting off a couple of ribs because I was really hungry and I let the rest cook until almost the entire 4 hours. The meat was nicely cooked and the flavors were interesting. The whole thing lasted me for four days I think. Not the most awesome dish but it was definitely worth trying.",
