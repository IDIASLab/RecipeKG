I had to make cookies for the holidays so I tripled this recipe and it still worked great!  I have learned through the years that I don't touch the dough with my hand except to transfer them and roll it.  This prevented me from my warm hands making the dough gluey.  Also this helped to make the cookies flaky.  I could actually see the flaky layers when I bit into the cookies!  YUMMY!",

I also make a walnut filling instead of preserves by grinding a lb. of walnuts or pecans and mixing with 1 1/4 cups sugar and two beaten egg whites.  Like another reviewer I also roll them out on a liberal dusting of powdered sugar in lieu of dusting them with it.  It carmelizes the bottom and adds yet another tasty dimension to an already scrumptious cookie.  These proportions make plenty to share for Christmas gifts, but I must warn you-you will be asked to make them every year!!  :)",

The recipe I use for the dough is 0.5 lb of butter and 0.5 lb of cream cheese with 2 cups of flour.  If the dough is properly chilled, you don't need much extra flour to keep things from sticking.  In years of making these pastries, the dough doesn't seem to suffer from a little extra flour - just don't over work/knead it to start or during the rolling out process.",

                "reviewBody": "A super simple, tried and true, crowd-pleasing recipe! This is my go-to, and I've got it down to a science: Make your life simple, like I have... Make the dough ahead of when you wish to bake. I mix up 8x the recipe at one sitting. Cut the butter and cream cheese together with the flour, then mix as little as possible with your hands; due to arthritis, I usually end up just 'knuckling' the dough in the bowl, to bring it all together. Next, form dough into fist-sized rough balls and roll each one between two sheets of wax-paper. Needless to say, Don't chill first! Roll them to the thickness you wish your cookies to be, so you don't have to roll later. Stack the rolled-out balls together on a pan (I use a pizza pan), wrap in plastic wrap and stash in fridge. When ready to make into cookies, remove dough from fridge one 'disk' at a time as you use them. Peel wax paper off one side to loosen, then replace, flip and peel off the other side. I use a pizza-slicer to cut the dough into squares and save the weird end pieces to re-roll when all 'disks' are used up. Put filling into plastic baggie and clip one corner off. Pipe filling in a diagonal onto dough squares, bring up opposite ends and pinch. Transfer to baking sheet and bake as directed. By piping the filling, my fingers stay clean and I am able to control how much filling I wish to use. It's not unusual for me to do a 'line' of cream-cheese filling alongside a fruit filling on the same cookie! Hubby love it and so do I.",

I like to sprinkle them with powdered sugar once cooled and they are just PERFECT!!! I made them for the first time late last night and they were gone by early morning.

                "reviewBody": "This recipe seems like its missing something. No offense at all to anyone who posted it. I just found it extremely weird recipe. First of all the dough has to thaw completely from the refrigerator over night. The \"dough\" is like a complete butter batter. Its like playing in grease. There is no way to shape them like on the photo. SO I made balls and put jam in them. Also once they cool they totally fall apart in your hand becuase its so delicate and the jam is to heavy for it. Most likely WON'T try this recipe again.....sorry....",
