Just wanted to remind people that the recipe calls for only 8 oz of pasta not the full pound that others have mentioned using and not having enough sauce. More important is not too dump all the food over all of the pasta at the very beginning. The way I do it is to just start each plate with a small amount of pasta and then cover liberally with everything else. The pasta is not meant to be the main component. Once the balance is less pasta more everything else I think the saiuce is a good amount. Hope you enjoy...",

The first time I made this I did exactly as the recipe called to do and was disappointed because the pasta ended up being too dry for us. Also there were not enough scallops for that amount of pasta (again for us). So this time I used shells for the pasta cut the casing off the chorizo and cooked it crumbly. As I did that the pasta was cooking. Then I did the peppers and added some cayenne peppers without the seeds to the red peppers. Next I did the scallops but used a whole pound cut into pieces. I put in a half pound of shrimp as well. When the pasta was done I drained it then added the peppers scallops and shrimp to it. Finished as the recipe suggested but at the end when the wine had reduced by half I returned all the pasta etc. to the pan and kept on stirring it until everything was coated well. The shells caught part of the chorizo and peppers and it was absolutely delicious. Thanks for a starter recipe!",

The sausage I bought for this was really squishy and even though I formed it into small balls before browning they fell apart and turned to sausage sludge.
