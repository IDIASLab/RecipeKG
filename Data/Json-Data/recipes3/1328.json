We fill an iced tea jug (the kind with a spigot) up with 2 pineapples and a handle of Stoli then after a week we add more vodka (the pineapple sucks it all up). When you are at the end of your batch and craving more simply smash the pineapple slices and more of the delicious coctail is created. Cheers!",

The pineapple and vodka should soak for a week and it is not necessary to refrigerate. After it soaks the pineapple needs to be crushed and squeezed of it's juices and then strained and the liquid reserved. At this point is when you refrigerate it. Serve up as a martini or on the rocks. It's naturally sweet from the pineapple juice but is a stronger drink because it is all vodka. Very good to sip on ice.",

Update: Tried with the mangos very good but a bit on the sweet side for our tastes. The mango version went great with a squeeze of lime and a bit of sprite/diet sprite. I bought another sun tea jar so I could have both varieties at once this summer.",
