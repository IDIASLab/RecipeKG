I then scooped the paste out and rubbed it all over the chicken put the chicken back in the bag and marinated for several hours. It is a DELICIOUS way to prepare chicken and has become one of our favorites.",

Sorry to say it just Didn't work for me. The turmeric was way too overpowering and I ended up with too much \"paste\" although I used a 5 lb chicken and the recipe calls for a 2-3 lb one? After cooking I ended up wiping off what I could of the turmeric and the chicken was still edible but only so-so in flavor. I looked online at other versions to see what I might have done wrong and I think the measures on this recipe are just off. Other similiar recipes call for two 2 inch pieces of turmeric it took far more than that for me to get 5T chopped. I don't think I'll be trying this again even with the modification to the turmeric amount. Sorry!!",
