Petticoat Tails is a mispronunciation of Petits Gateaux Tailles or little cut cakes. I love this recipe. Have always divided the dough into halves colored one half pink then rolled up the two flattened halves to make a pretty spiral pattern when sliced after the dough has been chilled. You can also roll the log of dough in colored sugar before chilling and you'll get a sparkling edge. I have even tried it with gluten free flour and they came out quite good.",
