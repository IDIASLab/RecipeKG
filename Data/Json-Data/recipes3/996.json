                "reviewBody": "The reviews for this are so good I'm inclined to think I got the wrong kind of Creamy Italian Dressing. Here's what happened: since I was making this for just my husband and me I cut the recipe in half counting on leftovers. I confess I've never sliced cauliflower before and thus wound up with large slices of 2 dimensional tree-looking pieces and a bunch of crumbs. Next time I'd slice each of the smaller \"flowers\". I happened to have frozen shrimp which I soaked in water until it was defrosted. Worked perfectly. I also mixed the mayo and salad dressing separately as directed. This was when a \"kitchen instinct\" told me to taste the mayo/dressing mix with a bit of the salad before I poured it all in. And that's when I knew it wasn't going to work. The sharp flavor of the Italian dressing (creamy though it was) was too overwhelming for the other flavors to come through. So I switched gears and used Ranch dressing (without mixing it with mayo). It's good enough to eat but not what I'd bring to a pot luck. It would help if the author specified the brand of dressing since I'm not the only one to be put off by it. It's very possible I missed a great salad here... the ingredients are healthy and look pretty together. But the dressing at least my version of it would have ruined this for me.",
