I make mine without the breadcrumbs, and with only one egg.  \r\n\r\nAlso, I do a sour cream mushroom gravy to go with it.  Once the chops are removed from the pan to a warm plate, I saute mushrooms and shallots in a 2 tbsp of butter and a tbs or two of brandy, and stir in 2 tbs of fresh sour cream...it's a yummy finisher to this most delicious of recipes.",

Well worth the extra steps but even the kids enjoyed it-The pork came out moist and tender -This recipe I will be making again-Next time for company",
