I measured nothing, just went with what quantities felt right, so I'm assuming I used 1/4 cup vinegar to the 1/2 cup oil.  I used this over Grecian Beef, Tomato & Cucumber Salad from this site and it was a perfect match!  I whisked the oil in very slowly to emulsify it and the end result was a pretty thick dressing.  Will use this one again for sure - Thanks, StevenRN!",
