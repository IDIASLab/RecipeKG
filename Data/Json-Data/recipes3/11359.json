This was an easy and fast recipe to make which was exactly what I was looking for. I have never used onion powder in a cheeseburger macaroni recipe and was surprised how it worked on the dish.  \n\nBased on another reviewer I did scale the amount of ketchup and spices back to about 1/4 of the suggested amounts.  I also added mustard,  chili powder and Worcestershire sauce based on our personal taste preferences.   It tasted great and will definitely make it again!",
