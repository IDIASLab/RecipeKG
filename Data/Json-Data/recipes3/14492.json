As suggested in the cook's note I replaced the veal with ground pork. I have never see or even heard of Vegeta so I Googled and did my best at making my own (minus the MSG). These held together better than I had anticipated so next time I might shape them around skewers for grilling to get a more traditional look. Regardless this is a good recipe and one I will make again.",
