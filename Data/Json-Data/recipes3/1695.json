The peppercinis add so much needed flavor but I got a little out of control adding the juice - so beware and control the pour!!! Ours in probably too spicy for our lil toddler man who is two years old so more for us haha. \n\nIt was done in 2 hours like the recipe says and it was so tender.  I seared the roast using saut\u00e9e method on my instapot first and a little bacon grease.  I also used two gravy mixes at the beginning of the recipe mixed with 2 cups water (instead of boullion or beef broth). I also had italian packet instead of onion soup mix. I added onion and carrots besides the peppericinins on the top. Definitely going to be a staple in my instant pot recipe book!!! So good.",

I also added 1 red onion thin sliced like another reviewer suggested as well as seared the roast on both sides prior to adding the rest of the ingredients to the pot. We made mashed potatoes to go with this and made a gravy using the broth from the roast. It also reheated really well which was great! For leftovers we made a french dip style sandwich which was also awesome. Will definitely be making this again.",
