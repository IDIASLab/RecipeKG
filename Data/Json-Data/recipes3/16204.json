Everyone even my husband (that hates sweets) had seconds. I did make a couple of changes because I used what I had on hand. Couldn t find my spring form pan so I just used an 8x8 square pan that I greased. I also discovered that I was out of icing sugar so I lightly buttered the crust and then sprinkled brown sugar on- almost a mock coffee cake at this point. Fantastic and easy recipe. My three year old daughter helped and that batter was very very well beaten before baking LOL.",
