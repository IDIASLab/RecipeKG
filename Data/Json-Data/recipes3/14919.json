For the second batch I added more almonds left out the cacao added flax seeds for more crunch and added a couple of tbsp of brown sugar. I thought it was better after tweaking it. I would suggest trying this recipe adjust according to your tastes. It certainly beats high priced store bought granola. It s good with milk on yogurt or on ice cream. Thank you for the recipe.",
