I love the little punch of sweetness and texture you get from the dried cranberries only wish the slaw had a little better eye appeal (just a personal comment that may not be an issue to anybody else). But putting that comment aside it really tasted pretty good. Seemed like an awful lot of mayo and salad dressing so I did cut that back a little as well as cutting back the oil a bit too. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
