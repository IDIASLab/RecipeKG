Broiling eggplant for 5 minutes underneath several other vegetables does not allow the eggplant to cook at all. In the end I took the sandwiches apart broiled the eggplant on it's own then reconstructed the sandwiches. If you like cooked eggplant vs raw I would recommend either frying the eggplant in a little bit of oil on stovetop or placing lightly salted under the broiler prior to making sandwiches. Our sandwiches turned out okay after I cooked the eggplant. I didn't have any mushrooms or red pepper but the sandwich turned out perfectly fine in the end.",

I sliced the eggplant with my mandoline slicer sweated it for an hour rinsed and dried brushed with olive oil then grilled it. (I followed the method from finecooking.com How to Cook Eggplant). I'm so glad I took the time to grill the eggplant--I'm sure it's great as is but I need cooked eggplant for other recipes and it is delicious that way! I left out the onion and used grilled globe squash instead of the mushrooms. I also had to sub cheddar instead of mozzarella. I made two sandwiches so I could have one for lunch tomorrow at work and I wanted to eat the second one as well! My oven broils on high and low and 5 minutes on low broil was perfect for this sandwich. Thanks for the recipe!",
