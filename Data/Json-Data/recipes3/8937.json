I'm not sure about the whole bunch of cilantro either My bunch is pretty big. I just chopped a good handful up. I've learned when you add a lot of extra ingredient into a burger it will fall apart on the grill. The way to avoid this it to put your patties in the freezer on wax paper for at least a couple hours before grilling. They aren't frozen but solid enough to not crumble when cooking. Works every time for us. I got lazy and just put the slices of the salsa ingredients on top squirted the fresh lime on it and topped with more of the cilantro. Worked great and didn't fall all over the place when eating. This is really a great burger so much so my son asked to have these again for his birthday dinner BBQ. Five stars if you reduce the amount of peppers... Update I've made this burger with ground turkey twice now and the mushrooms give it such a moist good flavor. I still haven't had any trouble with them falling apart on the grill.",

A slice of Jack cheese would balance the heat well. These burgers were a little wet and didn't hold together well on the grill.",

We mix in 1/3 ground pork it makes them very moist and we dont use a whole can. we chop the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and use about half a can of the mixture or 1/2 cup for a total of 5lbs of meat. we make 1/2 pound burgers out of the mixture(we like em big) we grate an onion with a box grater this helps the onion mix in to the meat well. we don't use cilantro or mushrooms but we do add eggs and italien bread crumbs...you have to play with it for your own family to get it just right. They freeze great if you place parchment(cut into burger size squares) between each 1/2 lb patty them wrap in plastic wrap and place in a zipper freezer bag.",
