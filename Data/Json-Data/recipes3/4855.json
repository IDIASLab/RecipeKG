Instead I took some cooked black rice from another meals leftovers sweetened it a touch and pureed it with pinenuts to match the measurements of the bread crumbs. Obviously this made a big diffrence but I really recomend it IT WAS SOOO GOOD! We drank pink champgne and laughed with every bite! It was THAT good!",
