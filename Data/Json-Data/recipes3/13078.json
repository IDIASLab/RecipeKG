This recipe uses the Japanese versions of pumpkin and sweet potato which are slightly different from North American varieties. Japanese pumpkin (kabocha) has a really great green skin and the sweet potatoes are yellow with a thin purple skin. You can alter the vegetables according to what's in season and what you can find, but root vegetables work best.",
