It is intended to be a celebration of the Piggy in all it wonderful FATTY FLAVORFUL GOODNESS! ENJOY YOURSELF for once you can go back to Carrot Sticks and Fat Free Yogurt tomorrow! BTW...450F for the first 30 minutes will yield a crispier skin and shallow Cross cuts just through the skin will make the roast pretty and easier to portion the tasty 'cracklin'.

But I did cook it in a roasting bag because I was afraid I would dry it out. I also used a meat thermometer and made sure that I didn't over cook it. I took one reviewers suggestion and cut the salt in half just because I didn't want it to be overly salty. You can add it but you can't take it away. I'm glad I did because it was perfect. This is now my favorite pork roast recipe. UPDATE: Most of the time I only marinate this for 6-8 hours and it still has good flavor.",
