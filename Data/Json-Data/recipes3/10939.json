I used a piece of leftover chicken I'd made before that did have a lot of seasoning to it.  The only change I made was to use Tajin rather than cayenne.  The recipe doesn't state how to use the chicken once it is cooked, so I chose to slice it in thin strips.  I love all the ingredients, and I'd make this again in a heartbeat!  Easy and delicious!

We heaped it on some thick sliced rustic french bread, and yum! the leftovers went in the fridge and the next day after the ingredients had more time to meld together it tasted even better!",

I had two chicken breasts totaling about 1.8 lbs. I ended up using just one. I'm not big on Cilantro so I didn't use it. I would use a bit less chopped onion as well. Great recipe and certainly something I can build on. Thank you very much!",
