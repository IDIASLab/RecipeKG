As another reviewer suggested I rolled the dough into 2 logs chilled it and cut into rounds with sugar crystals on top for added flavor. They look nice and have a good texture but they taste awful.

I made these per the recipe but rolled them for a 'slice and bake' version. I sprinkled some sugar sprinkles on the top for some visual interest and appreciated that they did not flatten during baking. They have the initial texture of a standard shortbread cookie but dissolve a bit too easily on the tongue (probably because of the Gluten-Free blend). Pairing them with coffee or tea is a great idea! I will likely make these again but will add some lemon zest to the batter I think.",
