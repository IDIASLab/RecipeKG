I added some garlic flavored tofu from the first step and put about a cup of fresh mushrooms in with the shredded zucchini.  I also doubled the garlic and will next time add some onion to give it a bit more flavor.  The finished product smelled great and had good consistency, but I think the extra flavor is definitely a must.",

I added 1/2 an onion when I sauteed the garlic, b/c it needed to be used and we love onion.  Also used about 6 cloves of garlic b/c we are big fans.  I ended up needing to cook my zucchini at least 15 minutes to get the liquid out.  Also added slightly more milk to get the sauce the consistency I wanted.  Fresh basil is a MUST and made it awesome!!!  Wish I could give this more than 5 stars!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great idea and was good. I only gave it 3 stars because it does need changes. First of all Parmesan cheese is not \"optional\" in Alfredo sauce. Based on other reviews I doubled the garlic and added onion and seasoned with Cajun spice mix. I also mixed about 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese into the sauce but it was still not salty enough for my taste which is what I expect from Alfredo. I think the problem is actually the cream cheese. While it makes the sauce very rich and creamy it's too sweet and just overwhelms the garlic and Parmesan. Next time I make this I will use either ready made Alfredo or use cream and Parmesan cheese to make the sauce. I will also saute the veggies in butter instead of oil since real Alfredo is really just butter and Parmesan cheese. The zucchini gave this great texture and mixed really well with the sauce and pasta. It's just that the sauce isn't a good Alfredo (unless you just like the creaminess of Alfredo vs. the salty/cheesiness).",
