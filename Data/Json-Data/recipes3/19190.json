Not sure why the directions tell you to grill then put in the oven, save the time (and the cleaning of a pan) and keep it in the pan.  Take the chicken out of the fridge 20-30 min before cooking (this brings the chicken closer to room temp, chicken will cook faster).  Heat the pan on high for maybe 5 minutes (don't put anything in the pan until you are ready to use it).  I then use spray butter directly on the chicken (to avoid extra smoke) and put it in the pan spray side down.  Let it cook on medium high heat for 5-7 minutes (you will see the sides of the breast turn white).  Spray the uncooked side with spray butter and flip it over.  Cook another 5-7 minutes.  Take it out of the pan and let it sit for atleast 10 minutes.  in short... 3 tips for tender chicken, 1 - take out of the fridge for a few before you cook it.  2 - heat pan to help cook chicken faster, allowing it to sear and seal in juices.  3-  let chicken sit 10 minutes after it is out of the pan for the juices to flow throughout the chicken.  If you cut it too early only the first bite will be juicy the rest will be dry",

It did create a lot of smoke, so turn on the fan ahead of time.  I also had to cook it in the oven for more than 5-10 minutes - it was probably closer to 20-25.  I don't know why people were saying that this chicken was bland - it was one of the most flavorful recipes I've tried in a long time.  I suspect that it's important to use a cast iron skillet, as it sears the spices into the skin of the chicken.  That might be the difference.  It was actually quite spicy, and I love and can tolerate quite a bit of spice.  I wouldn't change a thing, except that next time I might cook it in the cast iron skillet completely, as I wish it had a hard crust of the spices.",
