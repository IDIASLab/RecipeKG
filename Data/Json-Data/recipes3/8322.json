Mac and cheese is a classic and should not be complicated with too many ingredients. The onion gives it nice flavor as does the mustard. If someone wants to have some additional flavor just put some seasoned breadcrumbs on top! Thanks for the recipe!",

Wayyyyyyyy too much onion for me, but that is to do with personal preference, I expect. If you are a \"really cheesy\" person, I would add a lil less milk and more cheese..or at least more cheese. My two cents! I'll probably make it again sometime.",

For anyone who doesn't know the trick to making a roux sauce is to ensure you really stir the flour into the butter mixture and add about 1/4 cup of the milk at a time stirring until it is quite thick...THEN adding more.
