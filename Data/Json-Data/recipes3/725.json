If you make the  basic recipe, you are not going to get the granola bars you are used to in the store.  The basic recipe tastes like \"health\" in bar form.   \n\nHowever, if you have family that you know will not eat foods for health's sake alone, you will have to tweak this recipe. \n\nMy version is similar to those listed but it was a big hit with my step-dad (who owns his own restaurant) so I thought I'd share: \n\nTo the wet ingredients add: \n2/3 cup applesauce \n\nTo the dry ingredients add: \n1 tsp cinnamon \n1 cup dried fruit/nuts/trail mix, etc.  I used one of the Archer Farms (at Target) trail mixes and it was great.  \n\nI also put the mix in a regular 8 1/2 x 13 pan for 25 min (350 degrees).  Let cool. \n\nOne other note is that after several days out, these should go in the fridge.  It might have been the applesauce that caused some mold to grow, but I learned my lesson the second time around.\n\nThanks for the recipe.  I've had a bar similar to this before and was never able to locate a recipe.  Even better is that my step-dad with heart problems will eat it and its hard to get him to like healthier foods.",

The second batch I added 1/2 cup of applesauce (unsweetened and straight from the crock pot) and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  This made them a little more sweet and a little more chewy.  He enjoyed eating this batch.  For my third attempt I will increase the applesauce to 3/4c and then I think they will be perfect for my toddler!  I, of course, end up snacking on them too.  Update: I didn't notice much of a difference between the 1/2c and the 3/4c of applesauce for the fresh bars, but the 3/4c was definitely better for the batch that was frozen.  These bars freeze well.",
