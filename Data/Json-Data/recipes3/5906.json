I made the mistake of not adding as much of the seasonings and it was bland. I have also made it without fresh basil and oregano but I would never do it again. Fresh is imperative to the flavor of this recipe. I also add at least double the spinach if not more and it still doesn't overwhelm the other ingredients. Lastly I like to use freshly shaved parmesan cheese instead of the mozzarella at the end.",

I wanted the veggie pieces to be recognizable. We served the pasta in bowls and spooned the sauce over the pasta. When I plated the pasta and shrimp I added 4 or 5 cherry tomato halves on top and sprinkled it with Parmasean cheese. We will definitely have this dish again.",
