By the time I was done with this, Hubs thought it was \u201cprofessionaI.\u201d I sauteed up some bacon to which I added shallots and fresh, minced garlic.  Tossed in some fresh baby spinach and cooked it just until wilted.  Once cooled, I mushed that into the cream cheese along with the mozzarella and some chopped, roasted red peppers.  What a boost of flavor those few additions gave this!  I could have eaten this concoction all on its own, spread on some crostini!  But I didn\u2019t.  We needed dinner.  Instead of crushed Ritz crackers I used seasoned bread crumbs \u2013 another layer of flavor!  Finally, instead of commercial spaghetti sauce I used tomato sauce I had put up from my garden seasoned with some herbs.  I served this over penne pasta.  This was unquestionably the most delicious and delectable dish I\u2019ve had in some time. Thanks to Kraft/Philadelphia Cream Cheese for the basic \u201ccanvas\u201d with which to create my own masterpiece.",

I will say that I doubled the coating because the amount called for wasn't quite enough used fresh spinach that I cooked down in a little EVOO and I made my own sauce. I also added a little italian seasoning to the filling. Little changes like that really make it more personal and make this dish even more flavorful. I'll make this again.

Plus the filling is a great base for add-in's so get creative and adjust to your own likes or use what you have on hand. I used fresh spinach that I sauteed with a little garlic just until wilted along with some baby portabella mushrooms. I also added in some sun-dried tomatoes that I had on hand. I didn't have Ritz crackers and even if I did I still opt for Italian seasoned bread crumbs. For the pasta sauce I used \"Bertolli Marinara\" that I added a little white wine to along with some fresh basil. Wow - this turned out to be a really awesome dish that was perfect for Sunday dinner! Great with a side of angel hair pasta and a garden salad - YUM!",
