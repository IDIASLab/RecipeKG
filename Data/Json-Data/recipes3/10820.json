It was so much better this way. Everyone wanted the recipe and then couldn't believe that oil was the only thing on this salad. Please try it this way and if you don't agree, you can always add vinegar or something. But, I don't think you will.",

Our grocery store didn't have spinach/ricotta tortellini so I used a four cheese tortellini instead. We also don't care for olives so I omitted them but I can certainly see how they'd make this even better (if you like olives;) ). I didn't measure the EVOO just a drizzled a bit (and I'm sure I used well less than 1/2 C). Like the submitter says in the tagline TRY IT as written first then adjust if you feel it needs it (and I'm a tweaker from way back but I'm glad I listened to the tagline plea for this one). THANKS for the recipe!",
