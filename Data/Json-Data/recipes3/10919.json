I did make some changes to make this real-food friendly: I used frozen organic bell pepper slices, home made teriyaki sauce, fresh cut pineapple and raw cashews. When it came time to add the liquid, I did not use chicken broth as I saw no need for it. I would recommend not using it at all. I let the teriyaki reduce slightly and it was perfect. I did not add the cheese as I found it unnecessary. The Sriracha really kicks it up a bit. We served over a bed of brown rice. Very good, will make again!",
