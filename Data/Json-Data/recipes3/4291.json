It's a wonderful flavor (even though you might only think of squeazing lemon over fish - trust me, it's great). Consider serving it with cranberry sauce. In germany they have something like this, with small berries, but I haven't seen it here. Cranberry is close though.",

To save on costs, I always purchase an entire pork loin roast, cut it in 3 portions and use for different meals.  Veal is expensive.  Take a piece of pork loin, slice and pound.  It's just as good as veal.  Also, if your taste is too bland (as others stated), make sure you take the pounded meat, dredge it in flour that is salted and peppered, dip in egg/milk misture (I salt/pepper it a bit too), and then dip in salted bread crumb mixture.  Face it, a lot of the seasoning gets lost in the frying.  Salting flour helps a ton and keep seasoning near the meat!  We serve with authentic german potato salad, and bread on the side. I'm american and this reminds me of our breaded tenderloin, so I like to have it on bread with cheese and ketchup (but don't tell anybody!)",

It remains clear and unburnt till the end of frying not matter how big the quantity is.  Frying time is no longer as dreaded and no clean up of black crusty bits in between batches.",

There continues to be a dispute over which country was the originator of this delicious dish. Of course the Italian recipe invariably calls for quality veal - it would be totally unacceptable in a fine restaurant to use other than veal. Be it \"Wiener Schnitzel\" or be it \"cotoletta alla milanese\" the result in English is a delicious breaded veal cutlet. Gutes Essen! Buon Appetito!",

This is a great recipe--we lived in Germany for a year and Schnitzel was probably our favorite dish.  This turned out as well as our favorite restaurant there!  A few things that have helped me as I have tried to get the frying thing right: I lightly season the meat, the flour, the eggs, and the breadcrumbs (don't over salt any of them!) so the flavor wont come off in the oil; I also put each coated slice on a wire cooling rack and allow to sit for about 30 minutes (or sit in the fridge for awhile) to avoid having the crumb coating fall off in the oil; finally, after I pull them out of the oil I put them on a [different] wire cooling rack to ensure that they stay nice and crispy and don't get soggy.  I was very happy with the result. Delicious!",
