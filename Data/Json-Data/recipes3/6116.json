Many people think that this has to do with fish or sea food when they see the name, but it does not have anything to do with fish at all. The name in French is six pates, which translated in English means 6 doughs.",

Sea-pie was & is essentially a layered meat pie made with meat or fish and is known to have been served to American & British sailors during the 18th century. As a sailor I have enjoyed this dish on occasion. In Quebec this dish is called cipaille cip\u00e2tes or six-p\u00e2tes (in French) and is a traditional Quebec dish. The French name originated as an adaptation of sea-pie.",
