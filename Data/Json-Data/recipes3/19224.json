I think the plain onion mix is just too strong. \r\n\r\nAs for the reviewers who had problems with uncooked rice, your problem occured because you used non-fat milk. I don't know the chemistry behind it, but you need to use 2% or whole milk in a recipe like this where the rice cooks while baking. Try it again and I promise you'll like it!",
