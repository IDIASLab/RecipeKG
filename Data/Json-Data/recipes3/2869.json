Heather had been threatening to make it for several weeks, and each time I had been able to deflect her loaf-making frenzy.\r\n\r\nBut finally, on a night when I was tired and disoriented, she convinced me to put my feet up and read while she made the vegan nut roast for dinner. After a few hours in the oven the nut roast emerged an altogether different loaf. By the time it was done, it was less a nut roast than a simmering nut stew.\r\n\r\nHeather took a bite, and I followed. I feined a smile for several seconds as I tried to ignore the flavor, but Heather rescued me with her angry admission that she hated it, and it was ok for me to hate it too. Forcing myself to swallow, I spilled out my hatred and said \"I hate it. It's terrible and I never want it again,\"\r\n\r\nI scooped the wet loaf into a bag, where it sat, warm and disturbingly pliant to the touch. It hit the bottom of the dumpster with a thud and the unmistakable sound of thick nut roast escaping onto the floor. Now Heather and I are over the whole ordeal, although occassionally I wake up in a sweat, fearing I'll hear the sound of a mushy appendage squooshing against our window, begging us to give it a second chance.",

Use as much milk as needed to bind the mixture, not to drown it. If you do everything accordingly the loaf will come out firm and taste amazing. The only small adjustment i made was adding different nuts (walnuts, macadamia nuts, almond meal and i added some spicy pepper). \n\nAs usual there is plenty of people who are very unimaginative when it comes to cooking. It even says in the description that you can experiment with different nuts and vegetables, you can even try more spices or different spices. The fact that you or your spouse can't cook doesn't mean you should leave bad feedback.",

My first time making a nut roast, so I changed a few things after reading the other reviews, and the roast became a thing of beauty!   Left out the bread crumbs because I was not sure they'd be acceptable to our visiting vegan. Added garlic, mushrooms and cashews, and changed the spice to hot curry powder (spicy hot Madras style), cumin and thyme.  Because of the 'too soupy' comments, I used enough soy milk to bind, and cut the recipe sort of in half. I think you have to trust your cooking instincts when it 'feels' like the right texture. Totally vegan, and the carnivores were fighting over the small bit that was left!! Will make it very soon again, and even keep it vegan.",

My husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy who has recently become a vegetarian and he LOVED it. We got Italian bread crumbs so they were already seasoned. Because of this, I just seasoned it to taste with a little more Italian seasoning, basil, and sea salt. We used almond milk instead of soy milk and only enough to bind everything together into a meatloaf type of consistency. Instead of using the loaf pan, we put it in a round 9 in. cake pan. It ended up tasting like Turkey Stuffing from my pre-vegetarian days. This was a huge hit in our home (even with my super picky son)! If you tried it before and it didn't work, give it another shot. I'm making it again today because we didn't have any leftovers!! :)",
