It had a beautiful presentation. The only thing we were having trouble with was the acidity of the dressing I even added a teaspoon of agave to it to balance it out maybe it needed more or a pinch of sugar. We also thought serving it with some type of blackened seasoned fish would go well with this dressing. We will try that next time. Definitely has potential!",
