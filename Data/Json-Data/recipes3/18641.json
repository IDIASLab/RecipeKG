In fact, cashew cream actually thickens up faster. You won't need anything too exotic, besides maybe garam masala, to make this straightforward recipe. Garnish with whole cashews, lime wedges, and cilantro. Serve with rice, garlic naan, or both!",

I also made my own Garam masala from a recipe on this sight-easy garam masala-easy to make with ground spices. One tip-either use an immersion blender or a large blender when you do the cashew cream as I used my small cuisanart  and had water all over the place!

It took about 45 minutes for the sauce to thicken to my liking but that made the chicken fall-apart tender. At the 45 minute mark I squeezed the juice of 1/2 a lime and added the green onion and cilantro. I wouldn t change anything. Another excellent recipe from Chef John! Update: I made this a second time but forgot I did not add the salt the first time and included it the second time. It was too salty so I recommend leaving out the salt altogether. In an effort to stretch the leftovers and reduce the salty flavor I added broccoli florets the next night. So good that I will probably add broccoli to start with next time.",
