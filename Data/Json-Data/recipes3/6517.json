Please do not substitute all cashews for this dish. I love cashews to death, but it doesn't nearly taste as good. In fact, I rated a cashew chicken recipe here worse b/c it doesn't compare. I use a full Planters Pistachio Lovers (6oz) can found next to the other peanuts at any grocery store and just remove the almonds (which makes a good snack while you make this quick dish..lol).  I was skeptical about turning my oven to 500 & then moving the temp down, but it's amazing!  Outside of that, I use italian breadcrumbs for all my recipes.  Also, if you use the raspberry sauce from the \"Pork Chops with Raspberry Sauce\" recipe, be sure to add an additional T of raspberry to thicken it (on stove and simmer until half evaporated: 1/4C seedless raspberry jam, 2T orange juice, 2T white wine vinegar. Then take off stove & add a dab of butter to make silky).",

I used whole wheat bread crumbs (one slice of WW bread in the chopper worked perfectly) and I used sugar free maple syrup instead of honey. The maple smell filled the air as it was cooking and was heavenly. The chicken came out moist and the coating was crunchy and a perfect blend of sweet and spicy (not hot just flavorful). Thank you for this quick easy wonderful recipe.",

The chicken was so moist...I mean really really moist. I used skinless chicken thighs instead of breast. I did change a few things. After reading many of the reviews I made my revisions. I added 1/2 tspn of garlic powder and basil. I also added 1 tspn of onion powder and added it to the Italian bread crumbs since that was all I had on hand. I think it was a better choice for added flavor and spice. A hand full of reviewers said they didn't want to shell pistachios so they used other nuts..but shelled pistachios are readily available in cans along side all the other nuts made by planters and other brands in your local grocery. I put the nuts in my kitchen aid electric chopper...it was a snap. The raspberry sauce was really good and I too used the raspberry sauce thats featured on this web site \"pork chops w/raspberry sauce.\" I followed directions for that except I added alittle corn starch to thicken it to my liking.",
