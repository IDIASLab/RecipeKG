Instead of putting the sour cream and salsa on the inside, I served it alongside, but if I was making these to 'grab and go', I'd put it inside. These had great layers of flavor. I used the avocado on mine, but I omitted it on hubby's b/c he's not a fan of it. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
