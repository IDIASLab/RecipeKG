        "description": "A long-time family favorite. I've always brought home an empty dish when this is on the table. If you're tired of themushrooms, cream sauces, canned onions, and cheese, this is for you. No oven needed here; a big plus. Using an electric skillet frees up your stove top as well. Fresh is always best, but beans of quality may be hard to find this time of year. Canned or frozen instead will make a good dish. The optional use of yellow wax beans is an eye-pleaser and provides an interesting taste variation. Bump up a like amount of green beans if yellow beans are not used.",
