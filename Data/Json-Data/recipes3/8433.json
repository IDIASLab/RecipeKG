I know I don't like cilantro but this recipe sounds so good that I thought perhaps this time I might so I gave it a try. I was wrong. The cilantro ruined it for me. However my friend who does like cilantro thought the salad was great. I don't like to rate a receipe that I didn't make as stated (I left out the red onion and Jalapenos only becasue I didn't have them on hand and scaled the recipe back to about half) but in this case it seemed appropriate. My friend really liked it and I think I would too if maybe I used a smaller bit of parsley instead of the large amount of cilantro the recipe calls for. The lime juice as a dressing is really nice but be careful with the salt.",
