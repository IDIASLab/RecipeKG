I baked my first batch for 15 minutes and they are super crispy. Second batch, I baked for 13 minutes.  Better but still a bit too crispy. I should have followed another review and bake for 11 minutes. I sprinkled the red sugar over the cookies  as soon as they came out of the oven rather than dipping them in the sugar.",
