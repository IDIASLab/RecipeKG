Great as written or if you use plain breadcrumbs you can change it up with your own preference of herbs and spices. Thyme, rosemary, paprika, almost anything works well with these. I've even made them using taco seasoning. (Omit the parmesan) I make a sauce by warming some sour cream with a little lemon juice and taco seasoning and serve them with rice and a vegetable. Delish! If you don't have bread crumbs, crushed crackers work well, just cut down the added salt. Depending on the thickness, once you brown the chops, they don't need much time at all to finish in the oven. I place them briefly on paper towels first to soak excess oil and don't use any additional oil on the baking pan. This is pretty much a no fail recipe as long as you don't over-bake them. IF you have any left over...they are great cold the next day! Thanks for posting the recipe!",
