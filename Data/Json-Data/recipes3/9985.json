The only pasta I had was vermicelli noodles so I broke those up instead of using small shells. For the vegetables I used about a 1/2 cup each of frozen corn and peas. I was out of garbanzo beans so I used white kidney beans instead. After I took my picture I added a sprinkling of parmesan cheese and it was delicious! I'll definitely make this again.",

My family was less fond of it but 2 out 3 of them liked it well enough. Changes: I added a bit more onion (I didn't think c. was enough) and saut\u00e9d it with the garlic in a bit of olive oil instead of some broth. (I only had bouillon cubes on hand so I had to wait until after I boiled the water to dissolve it and I didn't want to do that all in a separate pot just so I could have a bit to saut\u00e9 onions and garlic in). I didn't have canned Italian tomatoes on hand so I used regular and added 2 tsp. of Italian seasoning. I also used frozen mixed veggies (green beans yellow beans and carrots) since I didn't have canned. I used penne since I didn't have shells. I was worried penne would be too big but it was fine. I was also worried that 2 tsp. of ginger would be too much but I gave it a try and it was good. Finally I skipped the cilantro since hubby won't eat it.",
