My hubby is the one that found this recipe over on Man Tested Recipes (sister company to allrecipes) and on that site it states that the onion rings are optional and I chose to leave them out to cut down on SOME of the fat. I made one substitution due to what I had on hand and only one. I used pepper jack instead of cheddar. My first thoughts while reading over this recipe is that it was too extremely \"gawdy\" and that all the individual flavors would get lost in each other or that it would taste just downright bad but I couldn't have been more wrong. I could taste each individual flavor with every bite and it all blended very nicely together. I especially liked the maple bacon with the venison. I did my direction steps a little different and out of order to suit my way around the kitchen but as written works too. I won't be making this one often due to the \"heart attack\" factor but I will be making again and it is one I will look forward to. Thanks for sharing Jraybuck!",
