I modified it the second by just changing around the ingredients a little. First, I added a cube and a half boullion instead of just one.  I also tossed in a couple of diced garlic cloves and some garlic salt and a couple dashes of cayenne.  The major difference was that I used a half a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup, which I added half of over the heat (when the onions were translucent) and let it cook into the meat.  Then added 1/2 pint of sour cream (instead of the full pint)when I took it off of the heat, then added the rest of the half can of soup.  Made it a nice beef stroganoff color, and it had a bit more depth to the flavor.  The second time around there were no leftovers.  :)",

I only used half because of reviews I read and it was like putting seasoned ground beef over pasta.  No sauce at all!! I also added two cubes of beef buillon to the water when cooking the pasta, and had to add 1/4 cup of milk,two tablespoons of worcestchire sauce, and 3 dissolved cubes of beef buillon to the meat mixture for flavor. I now see why some said this dish was very bland.  Adding these things helped.  I will make this again, but you really have to adjust the spices to make it taste good.",
