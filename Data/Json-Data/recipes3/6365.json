I found the dressing a bit thick so I added a T of water to it and cut the garlic to one clove. I added some chicken tenders seasoned with Italian seasoning and it made for a filling main dish. I took the advice of others and did a full pint of cherry tomatoes but the cook time was closer to 3 hrs. I am not sure the pine nuts were necessary as they got lost in the other ingredients. If you are looking for some crunch you might need to choose a larger nut. I'll be making this again.",
