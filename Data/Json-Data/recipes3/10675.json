The only issue I have is the stated amounts for the tomato sauce and the beans are a little odd. 2 cups of sauce is slightly more than what comes in a standard can of tomato sauce so I added in some water to make up the difference. My bigger issue was the 24 oz of prepared beans. A standard can of beans is 15oz and if you drain and rinse them they are about 8oz. So are we to measure 1.5 cans undrained? Or 3 cans drained? Since the recipe was a little vague I just threw in 2 cans of rinsed beans and that seemed to be a good consistency. Instead of using 1 tbsp of basil (because this seemed like a lot to me) I used 1 tsp. This was really tasty with freshly grated parmesan on top.",

I did make a few changes though: I added some mild italian sausage about halfway between adding the onion and adding the garlic. Some other people have said already another change I made which was adding a bit of water to the can of tomato sauce to get it to 2 cups. It doesn't mess with the flavor and it helps to thin the soup just a tad. Finally I used dried Herbs de Provence instead of the basil since it's a bit too strong for me and I just love Herbs de Provence.",
