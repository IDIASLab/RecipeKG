We loved the pairing of the crisp grilled sausages (we prefer the edges of our smoked sausage to be caramelized and crispy) and creamy burrata! Plus you can't beat the ease of grilling this. Dinner was ready in 20-30 minutes at most! Thank you Hillshire Farms for another family favorite!",

I used Naan so I had to adjust cooking time and cooking method but I think it turned out very good it was delicious. I also did not use Barrata to me it's much too expensive for any type of \"Pizza\" but I did have on hand a soft mozzarella.
