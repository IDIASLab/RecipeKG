I used a food processor to mix and knead the dough and then let sit for at least one hour.   For the salmon mousse, I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible but I did substitute Fat Free Evaporated Milk for the cream.  Nevertheless, it turned out delicious!!  If you are using fresh pasta dough, it is sticky enough to seal the ravioli closed especially if you press the edges closed with a fork - brushing with beaten egg just makes a sticky mess, especially if you are storing the ravioli in the fridge for a while.  Also, I only used about 3/4 of the mousse before I ran out of pasta.   I also noticed that, if there was a break in the ravioli dough, that the smoked salmon mousse did not leak out at all - it cooks beautifully inside the pasta and stays in!! Next time I will NOT seal the ravioli with egg, I will make more dough and I will roll the dough even thinner.  I would not hesitate to use the Fat Free Evaporated Milk again either.   Finally, after draining the ravioli, I brushed with a little olive oil and sprinkled a little shredded Italian cheese over and served hot.",

At the back of the box there is a pasta recipe and it turns out very nice. Anyway that dough worked very well but you will need to double that recipe for 1 lb of salmon or vice versa. I substituted cream with half amount milk I think it made the mousse lighter (in terms of fat). After all we enjoyed it:)",
