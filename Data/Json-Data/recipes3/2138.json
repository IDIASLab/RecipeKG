I skipped the crust to start. I used fresh green beans (steamed them for 5-7 minutes then threw them in the skillet with everything else) celery carrots and towards the end of the skilleting added most of a can of corn (so no zucchini or mushrooms - we don't like them). Otherwise I did everything the same - I just added a little more thyme and also some Italian seasoning. I'd say the cheese layer is a must - it was so yummy. Oh and be careful not to make the potato topping too thick. Overall fantastic meal that we both loved!!!!!!!",

I also just made a white pie crust instead of whole wheat crusts. One tip though is to make sure you drain your meat well because any extra oil will make your pie crust a little soggy. I got ratings from 4 to a five from my family except my younger sisters who aren't big veggie fans gave it a 2 and 3. Everyone agreed that the pie was better than the chicken pot pie we all ate this weekend at my aunt's house. Good hearty recipe just not the best.",

My husband thought it was 'edible' but was in no hurry to take leftovers for lunch the next day. I froze one of the pies for later use and will definitely make gravy when I use it to 'save' it but will not make this again. In a nut shell for us it was dry and bland.",
