Instead of cream, I used canned skim milk.  I also cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.  I used Kitchen Bouquet brand browning sauce, and served this dish with No-Yolks noodles and green beans.  With the leftovers, I stirred the stroganoff and noodles together, to keep the noodles from drying out and sticking together.  There was quite a bit of seasoned flour left over, so I think you could safely make this recipe with only 3/4 the quantity of flour.  Next time, I may try a dash of Worchester sauce, too...",
