It would be great anytime of day really. Next time I might change up the cheeses and add some ham. I would definitely add more liquid to it - I don't know if it needs a 3rd egg or more milk. I made mine in ramekins and they puffed up and were so beautifully brown. I might try tearing up the bread next time and making them look a bit more rustic. Overall delicious - will definitely be adding these to my regulars list!",
