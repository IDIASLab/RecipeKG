I didn't have any rosemary other than Italian seasoning blend so I skipped it. The basil and feta went well together I made several different pizzas but this was my personal favorite. UPDATE: I made this again along with a meat pizza for the family's Friday Pizza Night and this one was hands down the favorite as it disappeared while over half the meat pizza was left. I used Mike's homemade pizza sauce and dough fresh basil nearly the whole package (about 12-14 leaves) torn and plenty of feta cheese. I always make two pizzas one for them (meat for the men) and just cheese thai chicken fruit or veggie/cheese for me and this is the first time they actually wanted to eat (and devoured) the other pizza.",
