Followed recipe for filling but substituted puff pastry for the phyllo and the recipe made enough to fill both puff pastry sheets so it made two tortas. - I put the filling down the center then folded each side over and pinched it together at the top pinched the ends together then brushed all with melted butter. They only needed to bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes and they puffed up and looked really beautiful. And YUM! Will be making these again.",
