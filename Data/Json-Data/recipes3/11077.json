I changed it because the recipe said that the dough would ball up and that at some point I could split it. My dough was more on the loose side and I could not ball it up. So I kept adding a little more coconut flour until I was able to create a ball of dough although it was still somewhat looser and sticky. I also was not able to put it in a 12x8 baking dish. I used a round glass baking dish. I used strawberry preserves instead of raspberry jam. It ended up being a hit at the get together I brought it to and was asked for the recipe.",
