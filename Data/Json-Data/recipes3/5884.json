Once the red potatoes were close to fork tender, I drained in colander & placed in a large bowl (hot potatoes continue to cook a bit). I'm going try roasting potatoes like other submitter suggested next time. To warm potatoes I added a Tsp dehydrated minced onions, 1/2 tsp of celery seed, 1 Tblsp of white balsamic vinegar and S&P. Tossed all together, covered & set aside for potatoes to absorb. Used 1/4 cup of mayo, 1/2 C s.crm & 2 eggs as I only had 5 red potatoes. Didn't reduce other ingredients.  I mixed all the \"wet\" ingredients together separately (added a tsp of dill weed & used sweet pickle relish) then folded into the room temp potatoes. Added a tsp of Splenda for a tiny bit of sweet. Immediately store in fridge for at least a couple hours although I make day b4. How AWESOME! Mixed in cooked bacon crumbles right before serving. For anybody who may not realize - don't double dip utensil when tasting for adjustments...saliva will make the potato salad turn runny (I know, gross) but true!",

I did roast my potatoes with a little EVOO/salt/pepper in a 400* oven for about a half hour (and if you haven't done this before and then use in a potato salad, you're missing out!!!!), then made the salad as directed. I did increase the dill pickle just a bit and I used onion powder instead of onion salt as it was salty enough with just the pickles. I did add a little shredded cheddar as my boys are adamant on adding cheddar to all potato salads. My family loved this!",

Leaving the skin on, cut in quarters, gently boiled, covered, in salted water for 10 min., let sit in hot water for 5 min.  Perfect, fork tender.  Drained, rinsed in cold water, spread out on paper towels skin side down and seasoned with salt and pepper. Left to cool.  For the \"sauce\": mixed all ingredients, except the potatoes and eggs, a day ahead to let flavors come together.  Added some MW for the extra spices.  The recipe called for 1/2 c mayo so added an extra 1/4 c MW.  The sauce may seem to contain too much dill at this point but it will be fine.  Mixed \"sauce\", bite size  potatoes and eggs together about 9 hrs. before serving and that seemed to be enough time for the flavors to come together.  Only need about 3/4 of the \"sauce\".  One caution - make more than you you think you will need, people really load up on this.  For 8 servings I would suggesting adjusting the recipe up to 12 servings.",
