I used to work for a specialty restaurant in the 80's that served a soup called \"African Peanut Chicken\"...it was by far the most popular soup.  The restaurant closed for business years ago and took the recipe with them!  I used the base of the recipe (the broth, tomatoes, onion, celery, chicken and garlic).  To make it \"African\" I used canned okra, corn, rice, cayenne pepper, and coriander.  It turned out great! I've dreamed of that soup for years and now I can have it anytime I want!  It even has the enthusiastic approval of my family, even my picky peanut-butter hating 13 year old daughter!",
