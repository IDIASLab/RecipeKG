The first time I made it with skinless thighs with a 1/2 cup of white wine in the pan to help with keeping it moist.  In fact it created a \"sauce\" that was delicious and a pity to toss out (which I didn't).  I should have added some potatoes.  I did add some other herbs because my goat cheese had them on top.    The second time I made it just as the directions state and preferred the first way as it was a bit juicier.  But nonetheless the goat cheese stays put on the chicken and even leaves a crust on the chicken.  I was afraid it would melt and slide off but it didn't, it hung on like a trooper.  The first batch my cheese was at room temp and the second time it was cold.  It had no affect on the outcome at all.  My kids liked it so much they literally licked their forks to get the last of the cheese.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.",

Saw I had some goat cheese to get rid of so I put chicken breast and goat cheese into the search tool and came up with your recipe. I reheated my chicken in a 20 ounce ceramic bakeware dish at 350F mixed the goat cheese with garlic and chili powder and sliced 1/4 of an avocado. Topped the warm chicken with avocado slices and goat cheese mixture and popped it back in the oven to heat through. Came out PERFECT. No presentation issues either this is guest servable IMO.

As I smelled it cooking I remembered how I once had this amazing goat cheese and pear flatbread with a balsamic drizzle and I just had to make a drizzle to put over this chicken. It was fantastic. I can say that I did have some parts of the chicken that contained only what you see in this recipe and it was definitely good. I simply added a little of my own flair.
