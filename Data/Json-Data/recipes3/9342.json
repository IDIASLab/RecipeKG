That COULD be one reason also I would say you need to cook longer so they dont fall that is when I have my biggest issues...we recently moved and our new oven cooks much slower than our previous house so when I make these I have to cook them longer than usual. Good luck! And I only use white flour for these not sure if you are using a different type?",
