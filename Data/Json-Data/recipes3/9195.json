I have made this several times since May 17 2010 which is when I wrote my first review; this is one of those recipes that had all the reviews cleared out and it was posted again as a new recipe for some reason. This is my original review: Very good soup. I used all the spices as indicated in the recipe and thought it was flavored nicely. I used carrots instead of peas as that's what I had on hand. Only other change was I had a ham bone and made my own stock instead of using chicken broth. You can add as much broth flour or milk as you want to create the consistency you like your soup to be.",

The ham and peas were a nice addition to potato soup. My family really enjoyed it but thought it needed a little more pepper or some red pepper flakes for added flavor. I tried it before adding TB of red flakes and I have to agree with the guys. I did enjoy it better after adding those and heating for about 20 minutes to incorporate the extra pepper flavor. I served this with traditional San Francisco Sourdough Bread that we brought home from our vacation. Dinner was a hit!",
