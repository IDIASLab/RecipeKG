This is a classic french mushroom sauce and the flavors combine to make you nearly weep. I made this for a party I threw and didn't even try it till after the party because I had been cooking all day. When I popped a bite into my mouth I made noises that were well inappropriate. When you brown the chicken do it in hot almost browned butter to acheive the browning without overcooking the chicken. I think that may be where some people are complaining they destroy the chicken before they ever put it in the oven. The sauce needs to be made exactly according to the directions. I will cherish this recipe in my files forever. -Oh yeah I am going to try adding some diced green chiles next time but only because I have followed the directions once already.",

To our delight they've developed very mature palates and I knew that this recipe with all of the wonderful mushrooms would be an instant hit. Although I only made four chicken cutlets I kept the sauce amount the same and used about 4 ozs. of cheese. I didn't have any white wine on hand however I used a good hardy beer instead. If you're not a salt person leave out the celery salt; it won't make a difference. This dish was delicious!",

I love all the helpful hints that I get from the reviews of various recipes - I can tell who loves to cook and I am NEVER insulted when my recipes are critiqued! ALSO try using chicken cutlets as they are thinner and take less time to pan fry than regular breast halves - and I add Garlic Pepper to the flour to bread the chicken in b/c we love garlic and I add about 3 cloves of garlic and pre cut mushrooms will cut down on your prep time. Sauce is probably enough if you use the cutlets as opposed to the breast halves and you can cut down on the baking time if using the cutlets. So glad that everyone has enjoyed this recipe my best friend shared this recipe w/ me several years ago and it has been a favorite around our dinner table!!!! Doreen",

                "reviewBody": "This one is fantastic. My changes: no onions (yuck) used half pkg sliced mushrooms only used 6 Tbsp butter only used a sprinkle of salt and pepper (no fancy stuff) used more chicken broth instead of wine (didn't have it) used only 1 cup MJ cheese (misread recipe) and halved the chicken pieces (2 breasts making 4 pieces). My husband and I melted into this.. next time will serve left over sauce with rice or egg noodles. I also soaked the breasts in garlic infused olive oil for a few hours before I started because I was worried they'd be dry like others have said. This was perfect. When you fry the chicken do it over medium heat and just until the sides get pretty white -- I think actually browning them is what is causing the dryness. Don't worry they'll cook all the way in the oven. This was perfect. Thank you.",
