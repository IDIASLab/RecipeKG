Since I used the \"no boil\" lasgna noodles, the next time I make it I will bake it at a lower temperature for more time and cover it for part of the cooking time. Baking it at 425 degrees for 45 minutes made it taste like it cooked fast (the flavors didn't seem to blend like they should), the final layer of cheese on the top was too crusty, and the noodles were still a little crunchy (my fault for not using regular lasgna noodles). I also used more pasta sauce because I thought the no-boil noodles would need more liquid. Also, I'm a tradionalist when it comes to the appearance of lasgna. Even though it tasted superb, I'd rather layer my sauce/meat mixture and my cheese/spinach mixture instead of mixing them together. My daughter, who doesn't like spinach or sausage, even liked it!",
