Garnished with sundried tomato (since we have one in the family that hates it) parsley and red onion. Thanks for the recipe!",

I agree that if you are eating this over a large amount of pasta you need more sauce but if you're just eating it with a single serving of pasta (ie a normal person size serving instead of an insane restaurant size serving) you'll be fine. I recommend cutting up the sun-dried tomatoes -- mine were rather tough though they did make it look very pretty. If you want to cut down on the fat content don't saute the chicken just poach or bake it then cut it up. You won't miss out on any flavor because the sauce is so rich anyway.",

Instead of frying the chicken breast cutlets I browned them in oil while sauteing some onions garlic and turkey bacon (I didn't have pancetta) with them. I omitted the sun-dried tomatoes all together mainly because I didn't have them in my pantry. After browning for 5-10 minutes I added the sherry and let it simmer to reduce. When the sherry had reduced about halfway I added the chicken stock and let that reduce. By this time the chicken was cooked all the way through so I removed it to add the egg skim milk (also didn't have heavy cream) and brie cheese. I added more brie than the recipe calls for because I LOVE brie. I used a little bit of whole wheat flour to thicken up the sauce and then returned the chicken to the pan to coat. I served it over a bulgar \"risotto \" seasoned with butter parsley and pepper. My roommate and I ate every bite!!!",
