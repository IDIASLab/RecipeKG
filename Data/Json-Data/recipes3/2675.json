I only use 1 c. cranberry juice as the 1 1/4 cups is almost a guaranty for a cratered top.  I also use margarine, only 1 t. salt (Kosher) and 2 t. bread machine yeast.  (Be sure to take 1 t. from the 3 c. flour to use to flour the dried cranberries.  It helps them to mix in better.)  The result is always a small yet soft loaf full of wonderful flavor!",

My only complaint--and it's not really a complaint since I should have paid more attention to the title of this recipe--is that this really is a very tangy bread. If I do it again in the future I think I'd like to add some sugar.",

(i do wish they would set it up so the serving size always prints out.) no loaf size indicated so i read the two reviews to see if the loaf size was mentioned. review one said to reduce the juice to one cup the yeast to two teaspoons and shake some of the measured flour with the dried cranberries. review 2 said it was too tangy for her so she added sugar. (i needed her to have mention how much sugar.) so i proceeded to siphon off some juice; skim some yeast from the flour adding a little flour back in to make up for the skimming. then i shook the cranberries with some of the measured flour. also i added 1 tablespoon of sugar. it turned out well. my husband the cranberry lover said there are not enough cranberries. i'll double them next time. o yes i used the 1/2 pound setting and it worked ok.",
