I had a large wheel of Brie to use and this took care of half of it and my kids ate the soup asking for more!!! I changed the veggies to 1/2 leek sliced thinly and about 1/2 cup chopped carrots and added them at the beginning with the butter. I therefore didn't really do the roux but did let the flour brown slightly. I probably had at least 16 oz of Brie maybe a few ounces more and trimmed off all of the end and most of the rind on the top and bottom-I left some as I like the flavor. This was a yummy soup our family enjoyed as a main course with rolls-thanks for submitting it!",
