I reduced the butter from 1/2 cup to 2 TBS and used it first in a sautee for two minutes with the garlic and ginger to enhance their flavors before adding the wine and vegetable stock. Near the end I added a bit of parmesan, lemon pepper and cornstarch which resulted in a richer, thicker sauce. Thank you for the great recipe!",
