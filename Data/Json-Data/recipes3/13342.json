It has a dominant sour cream taste to it and I do not care for sour cream. My husband on the other hand does like sour cream and enjoyed these. If you like sour cream on your potatoes then I really recommend giving this a try. I also recommend adding more green onion so that the flavor of them comes out more.",

The flavors were definitely great but I had to make quite a few adjustments to time since it was all over the place. 1 hr is not enough time to cook this as I needed 1 hr and 45 minutes. Furthermore I would salt the potatoes when adding pepper as it was not salty enough. Broiling it for 3 minutes should be enough otherwise it'd turn into a blackened mess. But with these adjustments it should be reallllly good.",
