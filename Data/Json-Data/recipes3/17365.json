I think you can look at the ingredients in a recipe and know if it's going to be too rich,bland,spicy,. It all appealed to me. After reading the comments I knew that even though it didn't say to pour the marinate off the chicken thats what I did. I didn't add any extra oil to cook the chicken. Some said this was  dry, so I left the egg out and added a little less chicken. If there is anything I want rich tasting, it would be alfredo sauce. Not hard to make and my family LOVED THIS DISH. Do double the sauce it is so good you will want your manicotti drowning in it. A real keeper...Thanks for sharing.........    ",

To cut back on fat I used skim-milk ricotta and low fat mozzerella although this took effort it was very well recieved and would be a great crowd pleaser when having guests. This salad and garlic bread and we had more than enough.",

As a hint - my grandmother taught me to cut the manicotti noodles in half lengthwise after boiling, lay the filling down the middle, then overlap, lay in dish with seam side down.  Or, stuff uncooked, add extra sauce and cooking time and it will equal out.  Both methods work, I like to stuff uncooked, 1/2's the time for the process no matter what you are stuffing inside!  Definitely gonna be a family favorite.  Added my own spices, spinach and loved this with salad and garlic bread, good guest meal!!  Thank you Jeff!!!",
