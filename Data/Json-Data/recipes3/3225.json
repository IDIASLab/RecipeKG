I have never cooked eggs in the microwave before so I was a little skeptical...but this came out really good! I think the only thing I might do differently next time is sautee the onion first for a little sweetness. Well I might also add more cheese into the mixture (but we LOVE cheese). This is a very good base recipe that has plenty of room for experimentation. -Try serving with a sliced tomato...mmm! Thanks for a quick and tasty brunch Sunedan!",

I mixed in the cheese before covering. It's hot enough to melt it without overcooking the eggs. Dry eggs are not a good thing. A take it or leave it dish for this house.

Since there are just my two of us I used 5 extra large eggs; diced half an Idaho potato and saut\u00e9ed it with green onion and a touch of garlic; then saut\u00e9ed diced mushrooms - setting aside extra for a topping at the end; I then added some saut\u00e9ed diced Black Forrest ham mixed the lot into the whipped egg; cut in a little Cheddar and Jack cheeses covered the dish and set the timer for 3 minutes. I then uncovered the dish spread on some Pico de Gallo (fresh salsa) added more cheese on top; covered the dish again and microwaved an additional 3 minutes (full power 1100 watts) until done. I let it rest for 5 minutes topped with the remaining mushrooms and served. It came out just right not dry or wet and delicious. Frittatas are great for experimentation. A nice glass of white wine was the perfect finish.",
