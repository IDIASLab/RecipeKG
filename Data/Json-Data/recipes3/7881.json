A pre-made pizza kit fresh asparagus and a small package of blue cheese makes for an extremely easy but very gourmet meal. Fresh asparagus is in season right now and it complimented the blue cheese nicely. It was also delicious with my merlot. I will make again but I do recommend making this one when asparagus is in season because the taste of new asparagus is out of this world.",
