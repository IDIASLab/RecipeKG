I did not have any problems with this being doughy just take your time and don't scramble it just slowly section it into pieces as each part starts to set up. If you do not get in a rush it will turn out just fine. We enjoyed this with powdered sugar and \"homemade pancake syrup\" from this site. Thanks for sharing this unusual breakfast recipe.",

Some said it's bland but so are most regular pancakes which makes it perfect for a variety of toppings. Also some people said it was doughy. It is a bit more dense then pancakes because of the eggs but if you make sure to fully cook it till it starts to slightly brown it should be firm vs. doughy. It's almost crepe like in flavor. My husband calls it pancake scramble.",
