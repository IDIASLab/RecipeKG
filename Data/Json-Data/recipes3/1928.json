I cut the butter and oil by about half and doubled the chicken stock and bourbon.  The sauce was very thin so I thickened it with some more chicken stock mixed with corn starch, added 1 t. brown sugar and swirled in 1 T. butter.  I also added saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.  I changed the cooking method by saut\u00e9ing my chicken first and removing it from the pan.  Then saut\u00e9ed the onion and garlic and proceeded with the sauce.   The simmering time given in the recipe is way too long.  Once you\u2019ve browned the chicken, it\u2019s almost completely cooked, so be sure to cut back on the simmering time to maybe 5-10 minutes so your chicken won\u2019t dry out.  I think the changes I made improved this recipe, but it\u2019s still not one I\u2019ll make again.",
