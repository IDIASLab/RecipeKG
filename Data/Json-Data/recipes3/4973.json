I also added a bit of garlic powder and some black pepper, and used EVOO rather than Veg. oil.  And we used the charcoal grill: about half hour one side, flip, another half hour or so, check temp.   We planned on having leftovers, but we ate it all right away.  It was amazingly juicy and a ton of good flavor.  Will be making this on a regular basis.  I am going to buy caraway seeds today, so I will use it next time.  I am sure it will be just as good!",

I followed the time and temp. and had a tender a juicy roast with perfectly baked potatoes for dinner. I recommend highly.",
