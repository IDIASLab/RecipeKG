It came out wonderfully to raves (even from my very picky hubby). Both the marinade and the sauce were very easy to make. I poked some holes in the meat and then marinated it in the fridge for about 6 hours; and then roasted it in a 350 deg. oven for about 2 hours for medium rare meat. There was NOTHING left on the platter. The only thing that I would change would be to add just a little bit of thickening agen to the sauce next time; as it is a bit thin even after simmering for almost an hour. I will also try this with a pork roast in the future; and perhaps on chicken. It would be great on either one I think.",

I used a potato peeler to do the lemon zest not getting any of the white stuff which is very bitter and diced the peel really small. It sat in the fridge about 4 hours turned it every hour. I could not find fresh pomegranate juice so I used 3 pomegranates to make my own. DH likes his meat medium so I grilled 5 minutes on each side and it was perfect! I cannot wait to try this out for an impressive company or family dinner. Served with Over the Fire Scalloped Potatoes which means the kitchen stayed cool while the grill did all the work. Make this you won't be sorry!",

We made some changes... 1st the reduction consistency was perfect when we took it down to about a 3rd and let it sit for a good 15-20 minutes. We also tossed in some fresh grapefruit juice into the marinade to compliment the salad we had with the dinner (see MAGnWen Summer Salad). Lamb was served over a bed of white rice with a touch of rice vinegar. Awesome dinner it is now in the rotation.",
