Be sure to use chipotle (don't use other types of dried chile pepper) for that authentic Southwest flavor.  Perfect for Cinco de Mayo!",

On top of that I deviated from the recipe and only put in 1 1/2 T to start and it was still WAY too spicy. Maybe it was the chipotle powder I used. Who knows? That said in the future I'd start with maybe 1/2 tablespoon and let it sit overnight in the fridge and then up by 1/8 teaspoon prior to serving if you feel you absolutely have to. Also - I should've simply used a canned chipotle - mashed up well - and mixed with the other ingredients. I would've saved the 5.99 I spent for the overpriced chipotle powder in the spice aisle of the local Mega Mart. Canned chipotles are a lot cheaper maybe 1.50/can. A tasty interesting dip if you don't let too much heat kill the flavors. I can also see this being used a sauce for tacos; chicken fish etc.:)",
