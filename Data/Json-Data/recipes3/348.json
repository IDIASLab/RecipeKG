I didn't know whether the juice from the oranges went in or not. Some did some halved it. I used it all with a Butter golden cake mix as I couldn't wait to make this. I had to bake it a little longer and when I touch tested it the middle sank. The cake is light airy and moist. A little crumbly that may be the difference in the juice or the cake mix I used. It also looks like it is going to stick to the pan in places. All in all a great light refreshing taste. This would make a delicious summertime treat. Thanks Denise B!",
