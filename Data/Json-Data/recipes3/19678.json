Followed the recipe exactly but used smoked hungarian paprika as that's all I had on hand.  Noted the thyme was overpowering - hence only 4 stars....  Using 1 tsbp of cayenne pepper would have been too much for \"just chicken\", but by utilizing it in a salad, the greens cut the spiciness.  Perfect recipe to replace beef in a taco salad for those of us who are watching cholesterol!!!  Thanks Barbara for a great recipe!",

However, I took the advice from a few others, and used half the amount of cayenne pepper because I didn't want them to be too spicy.  I also used bone-in chicken breasts and baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes.  They came out perfectly...the center was tender and moist, and the seasoning on the outside was just right!!  Thanks Barbara, this is definitely a 5-Star recipe, and we'll for sure be using the left over rub...I can't wait!",

Either that, or not use quite as much spice rub on the chicken breasts before I grill them (I really rubbed it on thick)! If you like hot and spicy foods though, you'll really love this... just make sure you have plenty of cold beer on hand to put out the fire! :)",

I did not use a grill as it was about 12 degrees outside and I didn t feel like bundling up! I put some extra virgin olive oil in a pan flash fried the chicken on High for 2 minutes on each side while covered. Then I turned the heat down to medium-low and cooked both sides checking the centers every couple minutes. I had a light Cesar Salad mix and some garlic bread to go with the chicken. Was a fantastic dinner my husband loved it (he likes spicy food) and while I was worried it would be too spicy for me the bread and salad really helped cool it down and I had no trouble eating it.
