If you try and bake immediately after mixing the dough spreads way too much. Try adding some kind of peppermint flavor. I usually chop up whatever candy I have lying around. White chocolate peppermint bark is the best but I've used andes mints or york peppermint patties. Its fun to flavor it with extract then dye half the dough red and make swirly cookies.",

I read the other reviews before making so I made a couple of revisions. First I added about 1/2 c. brown sugar packed. Then I reduced the vanilla to 2 tsp. and added 2 tsp. almond extract. I also reduced the salt to 2 tsp could have left out more. Since the batter was still sticky even after refrigerating I just floured my hands and made balls then flattened with the floured bottom of a cup to about 3/8 inch. (I didn't bake the whole batch so I rolled the rest of the dough into balls refrigerated them on a cookie sheet and then stored in a sealed container.) I then baked the cookies for 8 minutes and that was enough. They turned out great! They left a little indent in the middle which when they cool will be filled with icing although they really don't need it! Delicious! UPDATE--For a trial run I served these at my 4 yr-old's bday party. They were a hit! The 13 yr-old w/allergies LOVED them and begged to take some home. She was thrilled to find a cookie she could eat that wasn't plain shortbread.",
