                "reviewBody": "I think this would be just wonderful as written but since I use \"real\" mayonnaise I cut back on both that and the olive oil by 1/2. Additionally (and rather than OJ) I quartered 4 naval oranges cut 3-1/2 of them into pieces and squeezed the juice from the remaining half in the dressing. I used red wine vinegar but possibly should have used balsamic.I didn't serve on lettuce leaves (no one ever seems to eat them); rather I tore up 6 pieces of Romaine and using my blender incorporated them into the mayonnaise/oil dressing). I didn't see any reason for the orzo (IMO it neither enhanced nor detracted from the salad) so next time I'll just leave it out. I didn't see any reason for the orange zest either (rarely do) so I just left that out this time. I didn't have them so I didn't include the cashews. But since I can see how those could definitely \"enhance\" I'll be sure to have them on hand next time. I had the grapes and they were delightful but (when they're not in season) I can see how raisins or prunes can be substituted). I can only imagine how adding scallion tops and/or chives could further enhance this salad.",
