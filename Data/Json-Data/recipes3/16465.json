I added just a little more onion than what was called for and used Neufchatel Cheese simply because I didn't have any cottage cheese. This substitution really allowed for me to skip the heavy cream, it just melted and blended with everything so well. For the croutons, I used cheese and garlic croutons. I also decided to put the swiss cheese on the top of the pie. I added it at about the same time I put the croutons on. I also discovered that an entire hour wasn't needed for cooking. Mine was done in about 50 minutes.. (not really sure that 10 minutes make a difference, but still) Didn't use butter at all. \n\nA wonderful recipe that I will definitely add to my more frequent regime of \"to be cooked.\"\n\nhope this was helpful =)",

This recipe is not really for me, but with changes might become something I make over and over.  If you like quiche, you will like this recipe.",
