Rinse off, dip in egg and coat with italian season bread crumbs. Spray two rectangular cookie sheets with olive oil spray, and as another reviewer suggested, bake the eggplant for about 14 min on each side.  While the eggplant slices bake, saute half a sliced red onion and a couple cloves of chopped garlic.  When the eggplant is done, place in a dish, topped with the onions & garlic, then with 2 sliced roma tomatoes. Sprinkle basil and oregano over the tomatos (thanks again to another reviewer!), then top with shredded parmesan cheese and feta. Bake for 20 min. Absolutely delicious every time I've made it!! ",

I simply took the advise of some of the other reviews which suggested to do a few things differently. I salted the eggplant slices and let sit for at least an hour, then rinsed, before breading, which takes out any bitterness. I breaded the eggplant and baked it for 14 minutes on each side. Baking definitely left much less greasy!! While the eggplant baked, I sauteed 2 chopped cloves of garlic, onion and sliced mushrooms (which was a delicious addition). I also added a bit of balsamic vinegar to the sauteed mixture, which for my taste, was a nice subtle touch to the dish. I layered the eggplant, onion, garlic and mushroom mixture, and tomatoes, sprinkled oregano and basil, and topped off with feta and parmesan cheeses. My boyfriend who is not normally a veggie lover, and I, LOVED this dish and will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe and the helpful reviews that have perfected it!",

It was a horrible mix of onion which didn't even cook all the way tomato and grease. I did not like it al all! If I could rate it a 0/5 I would.
