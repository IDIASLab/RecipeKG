You can't beat super easy and super tasty.\n\nThanks littleone for sharing this recipe. ",

I love scallops and this did nothing for them. They were very bland and well not that appetizing and I love scallops. I saved all the untouched ones and had them as left overs for myself after pan frying in garlic butter sauce but alas the guys would not touch them. Very dissappointing.",

I added a bit of white pepper and Old Bay to my finely crushed chips but I think I should have added a lot more considering the volume of chips; at least a teaspoon of white pepper and half a tablespoon of Old Bay next time. We'll see if that improves it.",

I proceeded with the recipe anyway and they were good but after 20 minutes they were done but not brown. I tasted them at this step and they were good BUT at this point I sprinkled them with Old Bay and stuck them under the broiler for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes under the broiler the chips browned up nicely and the Old Bay Season was a huge plus! Squeeze a wedge of fresh lemon over the scallops and you have a 5 star all the way! Can't wait to try this again with the sea scallops.",
