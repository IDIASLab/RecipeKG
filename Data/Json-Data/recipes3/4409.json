I prepared this a little backwards from the recipe directions, first sauteeing the shrimp just briefly in olive oil, then adding the garlic, and finally the tomatoes, basically just long enough to heat them, not cook them to death.  To finish I added fresh chopped parsley (this definitely needed that punch of color) and swirled in some butter and some of the pasta cooking water to make a luscious, velvety sauce. Served this tossed with angel air pasta and garnished with a few piquant caper berries.",

But I really really like this recipe with a few minor additions and will definitely make again! I used canned petite diced tomatoes and probably 7 garlic cloves because some were small. After the salt and cayenne and simmering a bit I tasted and decided to add dry onion and basil. As the sauce simmered I added a bit of pasta water to keep it from drying out before the flavors had really blended. Delicious with the shrimp over angel hair pasta.",
