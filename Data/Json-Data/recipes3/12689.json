Can be used for soup or as a side dish with meat. If you are making these for soup, add immediately to your soup, but do not cook these with your soup mixture as they will make the soup cloudy.",

                "reviewBody": "I have two problems with this recipe which we made for Passover this year.  1.  Using a good amount of olive oil gave the matzo balls a distinctly olive oil taste which I found distasteful.  It is not a traditionally Jewish taste at all.  2.  I found that 20 minutes is not long enough to cook the matzo balls.  Most recipes say to simmer them for 40 minutes.  I thought the recipe didn't make fluffy matzo balls when I tasted them after 20 minutes.  But once they sat in the hot water for longer - much longer - they turned out to be pretty fluffy.  So 40 minutes is a better amount of time to simmer the matzo balls if you want them to be really fluffy.  Next time I'll use this recipe as a base but I will use schmaltz (chicken fat) and canola oil for the oil - not a drop of olive oil!!  I suspect they'll come out better.  But in the end, they did turn out to be fluffy - with the longer cooking time.",

Then I folded in dried parsley (it didn't make sense to buy a whole bunch for one tablespoon), salt, pepper, and garlic salt with a dash of dill. Finally, I folded in the matzoh meal.  I didn't have three hours, so I let the mixture sit for a little over an hour.  I rolled them in to little balls and put them in the fridge to sit for another 30 minutes.  Then I cooked them for 20 minutes.",
