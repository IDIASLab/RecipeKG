To cut down on the work involved with the raw pumpkin I cut it into pieces and baked it as directed in the recipe \"Cooked Pumpkin\" from this website. It was then very easy to remove the skin and dice the pumpkin. I also only added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. The soup was very creamy and smooth even with the skim milk that I used.",

I did make this recipe vegan by substituting vegetable stock for chicken broth and soy milk for the milk.

I will definitely make this again!",

Accidentally applied too much heat too soon when adding the milk... I have no cayenne pepper (which is probably a good thing - I don't like spicy food)... and I added too much nutmeg so that taste was a little over whelming. I absolutely recommend this recipe (I've already emailed it to friends and family). I do not think it was too much work. One thing I suggest is to add the spices to your own liking. I made cornbread to go along with this meal - so good!",
