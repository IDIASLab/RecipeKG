Don't let the lack of a stand mixer with pasta attachments stop you; a hand-cranked machine works just fine. You can also go manual and roll the dough into thin sheets, which after a little bit of drying, can be rolled up, and sliced into whatever size noodle you want. Just be sure to use plenty of semolina.",
