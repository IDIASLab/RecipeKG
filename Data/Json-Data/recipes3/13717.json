I must admit to not having grilled the chicken but rather just stovetopped chicken tenders (that shouldn't have changed the chicken at all). I didn't use head lettuce but rather leafy red lettuce. Otherwise I followed the recipe. It just needed to be easier to eat. This is a great starting point because the sauce as written was okay. I hope someone else has a better idea on this because it has possibilities! I hope someone will give it a try! EDIT: We had leftovers in sandwich form tonight and the chicken was better! Maybe it just needs to marinate longer!",
