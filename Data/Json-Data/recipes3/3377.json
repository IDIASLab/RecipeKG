Also, I sprinkle salt pepper and Season-all on the raw egg side. \n\nSecond, after you flip the bread to cook the other side, sprinkle a little cheddar cheese on the cooked side and cover again and allow cheese to melt while the other side cooks. \n\nHope you love the suggestions!",

Over easy is best achieved if you add a splash of water (1 or 2 tablespoons) to the pan once you crack the egg and the pan is hot then cover it. The steam cooks the whites of the egg quickly which makes it easier to turn and the water cooks off so no soggy bread and no broken yolks!",

I lay the bread into the skillet and crack the egg into the hole, adding salt and pepper to the top. Wait until the white has set and flip the whole thing over.
