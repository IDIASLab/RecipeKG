First, I saut\u00e9ed some chopped scallions and minced fresh garlic before saut\u00e9ing the pork chops in the frying pan and I pre-seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper and a little garlic powder. I also cut the pork chops into small bite-sized pieces to make this more like a casserole. I used low-fat cream of broccoli soup (it was what I had on hand). I added about 2 cups fresh green beans and lined them on the bottom of the pan. I added about a cup of real bacon bits (\u201cHormel\u201d makes these in a jar). I also omitted the \u00bd cup milk as some of the other reviewers recommended doing \u2013 they said the milk made this dish too runny. I doubled the cheddar cheese and used fresh-grated extra sharp cheddar. This dish was scrumptious! It\u2019s very fattening, so I probably won\u2019t make it too often, but when I\u2019m looking for a special treat, I\u2019ll definitely make it again!",

I bought 9 butterfly pork cops that were halved and  were 1/2\" thick.  I used  a whole bag of 32oz. Southern style hash browns (they are cubed - I do not like the Southern with bell pepper and onions) 1 cup sour cream, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup with garlic, 3/4 c. milk.  I seasoned BOTH the potato mixture and the pork chops with:  salt, Lawry's seasoning pepper, Montreal steak seasoning , Jane's salt and garlic powder. I think one of the best ways to make this recipe good is in the seasoning and when browning the pork chops make sure you brown them well.  Also, the hash browns MUST be defrosted before using.  I  put 1 1/2 cups cheese in the potato mixutre and top with only onion rings, I also keep 1/4 of  the onion rings in the potato mixture.  My son in law, which never eats very much, ate four pork chops, he absolutly loved this recipe.  I am anxious to try this with chicken breasts. Thank you for a great recipe!",

Be sure to season your pork chops well before browning them in the skillet. (I used Montreal Steak seasoning and garlic powder). Instead of Cream of Celery soup, I used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic... MUCH better flavor than celery! Cut back on the milk just a tad; try 1/3 cup rather than 1/2. Also, add all the cheese in at once with the hash browns; you really don't need to save any back for the topping. I bought the larger size can of French Fried Onions and mixed about 2/3 of it in with the hash browns, then I sprinkled the rest of the can over the chops as a last step before baking. I took this to a pot luck dinner and everyone loved it. Five people asked me for the recipe and I even got somewhat of a marriage proposal... he said, \"If you weren't already married, I'd marry you right now!\" This is not a \"figure friendly\" type of meal, but it is truly delicious.",
