You need to use half of the can of condensed milk with the caramels and the other half with the cake mix. DON'T prepare the cake mix first use the cake mix like flour for this recipe. And the butter should be melted not softened. Also baking it for 15 more minutes instead of 10 results in a more firm bar and not so gooey.",

When the dessert comes out of the oven it will look like it isn't done. Let it sit for about 2 hours and you're good to go!",
