Two notes: make sure you use Spanish chorizo and not Mexican. Spanish chorizo is more like pepperoni and isn't a wet sausage like it's Mexican cousin. I also doubled the garlic and am glad I did.",

Overall, pretty romantic and cozy - it would make a good date night if you're not afraid of the garlic!  The only thing I will change in the future is to add seafood stock in place of the clam juice.  It was a tad too salty for me, and I think that was mostly from the high sodium content of the clam juice.  I used precooked Spanish chorizo, and it worked wonderfully.  All that simmering makes it tender.  Great recipe, thanks so much for posting it.  ",

I had to go on a bit of a mission to find it locally but it was definitely worth it. I can imagine that the flavours would not have developed correctly without the chourico. This was delicious. It was a bit soupy though - lots of liquid left over after simmering the clams. I'm not complaining and neither is my fiancee; however plan on lots of crusty French bread so you can sop up all the broth. This is a good meal for a chilly day lucky for us it was raining up here yesterday. It is a bit heavy so I'd hesitate to serve this on a hot summer day. Overall delicious. I'll be adding this to my meal rotation. Thanks for sharing!",
