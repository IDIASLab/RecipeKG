Serve it to anyone, and don't tell them there's tofu in it until they've already eaten some. If you like, pan fry some thinly sliced mushrooms with the onion and garlic, or add some canned mushrooms with the spinach. You could also add a little crushed red pepper for heat and sprinkle some extra cheese on top for serving.",

I baked it for 15 min. @ 325 just to bake off some moisture and it was great.I was worried that the spinach would be bitter so I added a pinch of stevia and that was the ticket! It was perfect. I work in a Wellness clinic and I can't wait to take it to my vegetarian friends...Thank you so much.!!!!! UPDATE....NEWS FLASH Just wanted you to know...Now I use this as a pizza base instead of a red sauce..Oh my! topped with fresh vege's it's the best vegetarian pizza( add meat if ya want)I'll keep ya up to date if I have any more brain storms....",

The variety is also important for mixes I like the Bloomsdale Long-Standing variety of spinach. As you saute add a tsp. of sugar and a scant tablespoon of lemon juice. Make sure you are cooking it long enough- the recipe says until just wilted but you want to cook it much longer - 15 to 20 minutes and keep adding liquid as it dries out.",

My husband and I (and EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD) love creamed spinach but I always feel so guilty stirring in all that butter and cream!! I was looking for something to make with our leftover spinach and tofu and this recipe was the golden ticket. I used only olive oil (no butter) fresh spinach fresh crimini mushrooms firm tofu onion 1% milk a grated parmesan and mexican cheese mix (b/c I ran out of parmesan) lots of minced garlic (6 cloves) 1/2 tsp salt 1/8 tsp black pepper 1/8 tsp grated nutmeg (b/c I think that's a classic ingredient in traditional creamed spinach). A tip is to drain the spinach mixture before combining with the tofu mixture. There's a lot of water that gets cooked out of mushrooms and spinach and it could make your creamed spinach too liquidy. This is a fantastic recipe. Beautifully creamy and flavorful. Thank you for sharing the recipe!!",
