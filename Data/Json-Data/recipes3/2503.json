I used 1 tbsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of oregano and 2 cloves of garlic, although it coulda used 3.  I seeded the jalapeno and didn't find it that hot, so next time I will just chop up the whole thing and add maybe 3 tbsp. of chili powder (the way mom used to).  As with all sauces & chili make sure that you adjust the seasonings before serving.  (I am full from all the taste testing, so I had to skip dinner tonight, tomorrows lunch for me).  Thanks for the easy recipe Danielle!",

I did leave out the Bay leaf and the Jalapenos and replaced the diced tomatoes with stewed tomatoes (because I already had a can in the cupboard).
