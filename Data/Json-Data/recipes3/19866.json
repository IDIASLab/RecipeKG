I can't make it unless I know there are people here to help me eat it or it's gone before I know it!\n\n****Here's a tip, line your measuring cup with saran wrap before mesauring the peanut butter.  It will slide right out with no messy clean up! I do this for all sticky ingredients (shortening, honey, pb, corn syrup)  Works great!***",

It makes it much easier. Just microwave for a minute, stir, then microwave for 30 seconds. It works great. Remember to use a microwave safe bowl. Love the recipe.

I told him it was Chex cereal that had melted chocolate and peanut butter poured on it.  Then it was tossed in powdered sugar.  He says \"Oh no... I couldn't possibly eat that.\"  Thinking he was allergic to something I kind of freaked and asked why not.  He put his little hand to his chest, took a step backwards and said \"Because it sounds too delicious.\"  FOUR YEARS OLD!  Needless to say, I had to give the kid a hug.  Anthony proceeded to gobble it up and even took a doggy bag (which he thought was hilarious) home for his brother.",
