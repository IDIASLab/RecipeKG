I read the reviews on this recipe, and there was an issue with the gorgonzola cheese melting out of the burger when it was grilled.  I put the cheese inside the center of the burger which eliminated that problem.  I substituted half of the ground beef with Johnsonville\u00ae Mild Italian Ground Sausage which when combined with the chopped basil and garlic put this burger over the top.  I typically eat my burgers medium, but I didn\u2019t want the sausage uncooked for obvious reasons.  But there was no reason for concern about overcooking because the mellow Gorgonzola cheese in the center and the sausage itself kept this burger moist and juicy with all ingredients complementing each other, but not one dominating. This was divine, 5 stars all the way!",

I thought the basil was a bit overdone which made me sad because I had so much of it to use and was going to get rid of it in freezer burgers:p I would like to give this 5 stars because my husband liked it so much (he doesn't usually ask me what's in a burger but this time he did...when I asked why he asked he said \"Because I taste something and I can't usually taste that\".)...but I can't give it 5 because I really do believe the recipe calls for more basil than most adults (and certainly most kids) will find tolerable. Great concept and I will make it again reducing the basil by about a third. Thanks Caroline Anne!",
