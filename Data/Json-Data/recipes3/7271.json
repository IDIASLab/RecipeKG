I browned the chops in olive oil (sans the salt and pepper). When they were browned on both sides I removed them to a plate tossed in the onions garlic and rosemary till onion was just soft. Then I added my broth wine 1/4 tsp. of Jamaican jerk seasoning with 1/2 cup of homemade low sugar cherry jam. After reducing the liquid I just tossed the chops back in the pan and baked it (I have oven-safe cookware) at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. I was wonderful!
