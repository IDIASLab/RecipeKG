The splenda taste lingers on the taste buds which I didn't really like. I made a half recipe and got thirty two cookies using a cookie scoop. Some reviewers mentioned the lack of spread so I flattened them gently. That helped some. For the raisins I subbed half the amount of mini chocolate chips. I also added one and a half teaspoons of pumpkin spice to up the pumpkin flavor which I thought they really needed.",

I also decreased the sugar slightly by only using 1/4 cup of the white sugar blend. But I used the full amount of the brown sugar blend. I added 1/2 tsp. allspice and I'm glad I did because it was perfect in this! As other reviewers have stated these cookies don't spread out much but they puff up slightly. A very good cookie that tastes great warm or cold. Perfect with a cup of tea! Thank you Splenda!",

They disappeared in no time flat! I took them to my 14 year old son's soccer practice and the boys devoured them - several wanted seconds and some wanted the recipe. I figured that's pretty high praise for a pumpkin cookie recipe with nuts and fruit in it! The light cakey texture is perfect and it definitely has JUST the right amount of sweetness without being overly sweet. I will use this one again and again. Yumm!!",
