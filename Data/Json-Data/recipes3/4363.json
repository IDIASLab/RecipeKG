The garlic powder definitely improved the sauce. Initially I wasn't sure which type of sun-dried tomatoes to use. I decided used dry packed sun-dried tomatoes next time I will use oil packed sun-dried tomatoes because the dry packed ones stayed very firm and I didn't like that texture. In the future I will also leave the nuts out of the recipe. I look forward to making this again.",

I was a bit concerned about the addition of mozarella, but it worked perfectly.  Smother a bowl of gnocci with this sauce - you will not regret it!",

I also browned 1/4 lb. of Italian sausage in garlic and added that to the cheese sauce.  The sauce is salty enough, so I did not any additional salt.  Absolutely wonderful!",

I added a few things to this recipe: 1-chopped onion 2-gloves chopped garlic and fresh sliced mushrooms (didn't really measure how many I used). I sauteed them in a mixture of olive oil and butter. I also did add about 5 large tsp. of tomato paste because I found the sauce needed a kick. I cut the sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil) with kitchen scissors and boiled them in water for about 5 minutes. This really helped to soften them up they were not chewy at all. I also omitted the pine nuts. I'll be making this one again for sure!",

Details: I used olive oil instead of butter and sauted 1/3 diced onion 1 chopped garlic clove sliced fresh white cap mushrooms and maybe 1/2 cup of diced sundried tomatoes packed in oil; then added salt pepper and about a cup of heavy cream and a tsp. of tomatoe paste.
