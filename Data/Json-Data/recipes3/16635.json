My fianc\u00e9 is a vegetarian so I get tired of pasta and this was a great change of pace.  I think the only thing I added was a minced clove if garlic to the spinach mixture. My only beef with this recipe is the labor. It took hours. Definitely not a weeknight meal. I think next time in the interest of time I will brown the eggplant on a sheet in the oven as suggested by my fianc\u00e9. 2 eggplants yields quite a few slices. Browning 5 minutes on each side takes ages. I may also use spaghetti sauce instead of the crushed tomato mixture just to see the difference. If your on your own preparing this, give yourself some time.",

Prepping the other ingredients also took quite a while used many dishes that had to be cleaned and made an overall kitchen mess that wasn't worth the time vs. outcome. The flavor was fine but nothing special for me. I found it to be more like a layered vegetable stew than a lasagna. I really missed the noodles to give it some stability and some kind of chewing texture.",

My family was kind of spectacle about it because it contained no meat! The meal still had that great hearty taste and the eggplant replaced the meat in an incredible way. The pan was empty and my family is craving more! Thanks!!!! Defiantly a meal to go down in the books.",
