I just learning to like cukes and I don't really care for cilantro so it's not my personal fav but everyone else seems to love it! I love that it's fairly easy to make and is a cool light alternative to many mayo coated calorie dense BBQ dishes! I used 1 cuke (it was rather large) and 1/2 jalap (my jalaps were HUGE....5\".....both times...I'd prefer a little more heat but I always error on the safe side when taking for others). I also couldn't find fresh cilantro so I had to use dried (used 2 heaping tsps to adjust). I also doubled the lime juice....everyone loves guessing what's in this salsa! TY for a great easy recipe. Oh yeah I used red onion for both the bite and color and the second time I also added half a diced red bell pepper.",
