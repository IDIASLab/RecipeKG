I didn't bake it; I just cooked it in a large saucepan. I cubed 3 small apples and diced two medium-sized onions and sauteed them in the butter with 2 tsp minced garlic (I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand). I cut two large chicken breasts into one-inch cubes and added them to the pan. Before the chicken sealed I added 1 1/2 tbsp curry powder and about 1 tsp garam masala. Once the chicken was sealed I added the broth milk and then slowly sprinkled in the flour. Finally I added about 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. I let it simmer for awhile and it thickened a lot so I added probably about another 1/2 cup of milk. I was also busy doing other things so I just turned it down to low and let it simmer very lightly for about 1/2 hour or 45 minutes. I served it over basmati rice. This is definitely a keeper. Yum!",
