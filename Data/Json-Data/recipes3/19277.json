I used just one 4 oz can of drained mushrooms 1 can of cream of mushroom soup 1 can of cream of celery soup only 2 cups of milk and 1 envelope of onion soup mix (most poured in the mixture and just a bit sprinkled on top). The cream of celery added a nice twist to the dish. The baking time was pretty accurate. The chicken turned out very moist and the rice was good too--not too firm and yet not too mushy. My kids (ages 6 and 4) ate this dish and liked it and my husband and I both had seconds. Will probably make this again as revised.",
