I used very thin boneless pork loin chops instead of the pork tenderloin and it worked out very well. The pork cooks really fast and the sauce tastes like you spent hours on it.   There were four of us 'girls' for lunch and there wasn't a single morsel leftover.  I garnished with some diced fresh tomatoes.  Next time I will steam some broccoli to go along with it.   Thank you!  Great recipe!",

I couldn't get enough and my husband who is very picky especially regarding pork entrees was pleased as well. A happy husband makes a happy me!
