I started with just 1/2 cup and it was the perfect amount. Any more would have overflowed my single cup Ninja blender and would have made it too tangy for me. (Plus the calorie count for one serving is over 600 so reducing the yogurt brings the calories down.) This tasted healthy and was filling. Thanks for the recipe.",
