I guessed, by using approx 5-1/2 oz for the filling and approx 1/4 c for the icing.  I also did not use anywhere near the 7 teaspoons of corn syrup that were called for - I probably used a couple of teaspoons.  Also - I found it much easier to spread the filling on each triangle, roll up and then overlap with the others to form a ring onto the baking sheet.  The method as stated did not work well for me at all.  The taste was just \"ok\" to everyone I served them to.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Shannon Marie.",
