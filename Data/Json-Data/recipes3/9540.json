I did not add the avocados because a) they are too expensive! and b) I was afraid they would get mushed up inside but I am curious to try them next time. This bechamel sauce was a little gluey...normally I use less flour so I recommend doing the same. But the beans chilies and Mexican seasoned cheese were really good addition.",
