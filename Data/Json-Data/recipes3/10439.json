Since Allrecipes slightly changed my original recipe, from Ribeye or Strip steak they will not allow me to change it.  \nRecently, we have been using Tri-Tip steak for it and we think it is much better.  The Tri-Tip can hold up to the longer cook time and is cheaper than our original recipe.  Hope you all enjoy the recipe and the tweak!",

After reading the instructions over and over, I find no mention of adding the onions and mushrooms to the dish.\nAt this point I did dump some on my plate and the rest into the beef pan.\nIt was still delicious\nLearning,\nPaul",
