I browned raw cubed chicken breast in a little evoo/butter before proceeding with the recipe. I didn't use as much butter/flour as called for just a teaspoon of each that I cooked to a light brown before adding the milk cream cheese milk and wine. The cream cheese I used was Philadelphia's cooking cream which made it SO much easier to work with. I used French's chardonnay dijon mustard omitted the extra salt and I added a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder and couple good shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. The cheddar cheese I used was extra sharp. The flavor of this casserole was out of this world BUT our issue with it was it was REALLY thick. REALLY thick. And kind of gummy. I think this would be excellent if it had a little more milk maybe about a half cup or so. Then it might be perfect. My kids absolutely loved it thickness aside. I'll make this again. I served steamed broccoli on the side but next time I might just stir it in. I think it would be a great all-in-one casserole dinner.",

Also added a little minced onion and was very generous with the rotini. Family loved it this way.",
