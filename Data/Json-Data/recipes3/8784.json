People say real poutine must have mozzarella cheese curds - I emphatically disagree! In every restaurant I've been to in Ontario, they use shredded cheese. If you're like me and prefer the English-Canadian version (non-cheese curds) and want to try something different, try this!",

He laughed at the little bit of lettuce I put on the side \"What is that? Trying to make this look healthy?\" The Big Mac Poutine comment in the Cook's Note explained the lettuce mayo ketchup - of course I didn't see that until after I made this. Thanks for a fun recipe Robyn.",
