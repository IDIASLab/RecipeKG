        "description": "I always wanted to learn to make an excellent roasted chicken at home. I tried to find a recipe that is quick and easy, but in the process, I didn't lose the flavors of the chicken. I could not see any that had a few steps or ingredients. This is a recipe I came up with after trying many different methods. I used to buy a lot of rotisserie chicken, but after I learned this easy chicken dish, I don't think I will ever go back. The chicken turns out to be flavorful and juicy. It can be served with the vegetables as a main dish or use it in other recipes that have chicken in them.",
