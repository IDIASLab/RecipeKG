I used a 3 pound chuck roast, browned it as directed, then put it into my crock pot on high for 3 hours. I followed the recipe (browned onions and garlic) except that I precooked a pound of chunked up carrots in my microwave (about 7 minutes) and boiled (skins on/our preference) 6 regular sized potatos for about 45 minutes. I added the cooked carrots and potatoes (chunked up) to the crock pot and gently stirred them in for another half hour at the end. The total time was four hours. The meat was tender, the gravy was sweet and delicious! Next time I do it, I might add a bit of water before the carrots and potatoes at the end to increase the gravy, as the potatoes did absorb some. (But it was still DELICIOUS!)",

Firstly, I braise the beef in butter and olive oil.  Second, I add shallots and a few more cloves of garlic.  Third, and this is the clincher, I use blackberry and/or cherry wine AND beef broth to cover the beef instead of water. If I need to add more liquid, I just keep adding wine!!  I usually cook it for the full 3 1/2 hours.  This thing falls apart, it is so moist and tender.
