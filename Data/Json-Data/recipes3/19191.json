This stayed on the chicken nicely and you still got the taste of the pecans.  I browned them on the stove top as directed, but then placed them under the broiler to finish them up.  This kept the breading from getting soggy.",

Cooked in no time and was tender and moist. My 91 year old Mother said it was devine. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.",

I always read the comments first so I knew to boil the 6 chicken breasts first and I chopped the pecans almost to a powder! The chicken was still warm when I placed it in a large ziploc bag with extra maple syrup so I threw it into the freezer for a few minutes before coating it for frying (I wish the maple syrup was a bit thicker may have to work on that). I used a little butter and olive oil to fry it (that's my oil of preference). It was absolutely delicious!! Served with (slightly-over)-roasted sweet potatoes -- marvelous together.

I made it lower in fat by using only 1 Tbl. of oil and 1/2 Tbl. butter. I preferred honey to maple syrup and I didn't bother measuring it (just brush-coated both sides of the chicken breasts). I made served this cut up on top of a salad that had romaine lettuce tangerine slices celery toasted pecans dried cranberries and cranberry vinaigrette (dressing recipe called \"Green Salad with Cranberry Vinaigrette\" from this site). I too had problems getting the chicken done without burning the breading. I just cooked it for 20 minutes on low heat then popped it in the microwave for 4 minutes afterward - it still stayed juicy. The 2nd time I made this I cooked it in the pan until golden then transferred to a glass baking dish covered it in foil and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Perfect!! Thanks for the recipe!",
