It was cooked a bit longer--was helping hubs repair a window--but it still turned out delicious. I love the flavor and the cornmeal and flour mix worked well. I used my mandolin to slice the baby eggplant I had so I ended up with lengthwise slices instead of rounds--baby eggplant is apparently too small for rounds on my mandolin. I did salt rinse and pat dry before putting on the topping. I really enjoyed this and since hubs won't touch eggplant it's all mine. Thanks for the recipe!",

I kept to the recipe only change was I forgot to oil the pan(I did brush the tops) so when I flipped them half way through I brushed EVOO on the tops. I will say I had some that didn't fit into the oven so I pan fried them and we both agreed those were 5's but not the ones from the oven. Sorry but the other two recipes I tried from this site were much better as written. So if trying this recipe maybe you should pan fry. The breading is tasty.",
