Baked for the same amount of time and OH MY GOODNESS...it was soooooo good.  I did sprinkle the top with a bit of extra parmesan to give it a nice browned topping.  EXCELLENT.  I think this would work no matter the size, the large ones would serve more than one person.  I love the tender tiny ones.  ",

Kept the firmer flesh to be chopped into the filling & rest of the snot & seeds were destined for the garbage disposal. The filling was DELICIOUS except for being overly salty. I added a half tsp of sea salt which was a huge mistake - I should have tasted the mixture 1st but I had only used half the bacon! But it was still really salty once combined with the cheese (I used 1/4 c of parmesan blend that includes romano & asiago cheeses as well). After seeing how slimy & wet the insides of the squash was I only used half of the soft bread crumbs I had ready & used nice dry panko for the rest. It did the trick & the squash was NOT slimy after baking at least. I also shredded in a handful of spinach leaves and chopped some sun dried tomatoes & threw in for some color and flavor depth and it was soooo good. The squash on the other hand was a flavorless wet mush on the outside of a really tasty stuffing (maybe it should have been basted in garlic oil then roasted or cooked in chicken broth prior to stuffing instead of steaming it??)",
