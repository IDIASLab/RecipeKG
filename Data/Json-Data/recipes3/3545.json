First I did what the other reviewers suggested and used mayo to mix with the cucumbers instead of the butter. Second I used garden vegetable cream cheese spread to spread on the bread. It added a lot of flavor and worked well with the other ingredients. I made this for my family to go along with soup and they really liked it!",
