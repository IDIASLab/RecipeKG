Curry powder is actually a pulverized blend of up to 20 spices herbs and seeds. Among those most commonly used are cardamom chiles cinnamon cloves coriander cumin fennel seed fenugreek mace nutmeg red and black pepper poppy and sesame seeds saffron tamarind and turmeric (the latter is what gives curried dishes their characteristic yellow color). Commercial curry powder--which bears little resemblance to the freshly ground blends of southern India--comes in two basic styles: standard and the hotter of the two \"Madras\" curry powder.",

I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream coconut oil and about half the onions. I think the 1 tsp cumin seeds in the recipe is supposed to be mustard seeds because cumin seeds don't splutter but mustard seeds do (also it seems odd to have both cumin seeds and ground cumin in the recipe) so I used mustard seeds. And finally I added cauliflower because I had some I needed to use up. Great flavor and a definite keeper!",
