To correct this, crack an egg in your mixture and mix well before forming into cakes and frying. This will keep them together and will also assure even browning.

My six year old daughter came back for seconds. Great with a tossed salad.",

I added an egg and would add another next time. I also added about a teaspoon and a half of dijon mustard and a small palmful of dried chives. Formed the patties and let them rest for a good hour and they still crumbled in the pan. Ultimately I just added liquid and made a hash out of them. It was delicious but this recipe needs to call for at least 2 eggs and perhaps something more in order to bind the mixture. Thanks!",
