Every Jewish family makes it differently ex. dairy no dairy sweet or savory raisins no raisins etc. I reduced to 1 onion and added 1 pint (2 cups)of cottage cheese 1 cup sour cream and no bread crumbs (VIEW MY PHOTO). Depending on your dietary guidlines or preference the recipe is very flexible. I also serve this with a roast chicken or beef brisket. Thank you Goldie for the recipe!!",
