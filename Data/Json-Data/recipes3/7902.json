                "reviewBody": "OMG!!!! Can I begin to tell you how amazing this is! The only thing I changed was that I added boneless diced pork at the five minute mark of the ten minute simmer with the kaffir lime leaves (i.e. five minutes coconut milk and lime; the next five minutes add the pork). I only did this to make it a little heartier but TRUST ME even as written this is an amazing dish with an incredible balance. Do do DO try to get galangal and not ginger. So many people treat them as interchangeable but trust me they're not. You will know the difference because galangal is smoother on the surface and has almost \"tiger stripes\" on it (google a picture of it you'll see what I mean). And YES if you can find them spring for the bag of kaffir lime leaves. They keep forever in the freezer and are well worth the investment for the difference they make in flavour to using just lime juice. I served it over jasmine rice and my life changed for the better forever. Thanks for the great recipe Wiley!",

Overall it was delicious I was afraid to use the fish sauce that I had purchased since it was thick and not the clear type but I couldn\u2019t even taste it so it turned out great, the whole dish. The only thing I would change is to add a little bit of either flour or corn starch to make it Slightly thicker since it was pretty runny so it would stick to the rice better... I added a pinch of saffron in the rice as well, overall it was delicious!",
