                "reviewBody": "Ive made the cauliflower crust a few times. I added a little paremesean cheese to it ( like1 to 2 Tb) when I mix it and usually just use the egg white. One of the keys I found to making a pizza like crust , besides draining it well, is to bake it on BOTH sides. I put it on the baking sheet on the parchment, pat it into a thin round, then bake it about 8 to 10 minutes till the bottom is golden. Then I flip it over, add the pizza sauce, more mozzerrella and the toppings and then  pop it back in the oven till the other side is golden and the cheese is melted.  You  have to bake both sides of the crust to get the pizza crust texture you want. I love it. It has a really good taste.  I've been making it about once a week. (Ps I use a fine mesh  laundry bag to drain my cauliflower- it works excellent)",

Came out nice and dry. Whipped it up and put into a well-greased 9 inch pie pan.  (non-stick cooking spray) Baked in my convection oven for 30 minutes (I think I will lower that to 20-25 next time), added sauce and toppings. Hubby looked at it and told me he didn't think it would be enough for us but we had it with a big Caesar salad and we are both so full! I couldn't finish my portion so I only had a piece and a half as we had divided the pie sized pizza into quarters. DELICIOUS! Side note: look up the \"exquisite pizza sauce recipe\" here on all recipes and make it with only 1tsp sugar or you can substitute some or all of the water in that with carrot juice for a more carb-friendly sauce.",
