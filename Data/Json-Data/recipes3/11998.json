But if you cover whole thenfirdt half cooks, ut dries out the center more, then cook uncovered after you flip them.\nThird, if you don't like dill, change out the herbs and seasoning. we have used chilipowder and cumin,  Italian hervs, and even a homemade chrry powder. All were fantastic.\nReally enjoyed this recipe!",
