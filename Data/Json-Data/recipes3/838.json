                "reviewBody": "This recipe needs help. But with a few minor modifications, it can be terrific. First, don't cook the shrimp separately - you're losing a lot of flavor that way. I heated up about 1 tbls of olive oil and 1/2 tbls of butter and sauteed the chopped garlic, chopped shallot (because I had it), red pepper (and I even added a little cayenne), a little basil and then the shrimp. Saute for just a couple of minutes then remove the shrimp into a separate bowl - leave garlic/everything else in the pan. Then I added the wine (a bit more than 2 Tbls) and reduced it before adding the tomatoes - here I added a touch more olive oil as well. Simmer/cook down and when ready to serve w/ pasta, add the shrimp back and cook for a couple of minutes. I put drained pasta directly into the sauce and it soaked up the sauce wonderfully. I also made only a 1/2 batch and it was enough for two meals for my husband and me. With these changes, it was delicious!",

My recommendation is to cook the shrimp in olive oil and a little light margarine with crushed red pepper prior to making the sauce.  The shrimp just seem to soak up the spicy flavor of the red pepper infused oil.  I love spicy though.....  I always use cheap but relatively good red table wine (love that Concha y Toro!) and plenty of it, though if it becomes too thin you can add tomato paste. Overall, very good with those changes.",
