I ve made this at least a half a dozen times already this summer and it s turned into a real comfort food. I ve been doubling the recipe and eating the leftovers for lunch. It s the sweet corn and cilantro that keeps me going back for another bite. The only change I make is that I do not add cumin. The first time I made this I was afraid the cumin would clash with something else that I made for dinner so I left it out. We loved this so much without it that I can t bring myself to add it. I m sure it would be good just the same. Thank you Bibi for sharing your fantastic creation!",
