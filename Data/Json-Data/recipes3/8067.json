When cooking (I cooked in an electric non-stick skillet- no oil to worry about) this recipe we had the pool man here closing the pool and he asked \"what's that SMELL?\" - I made him a burger too:) I also used a random apple that I had on hand and used egg beaters. They were tender delicious quick to cook. You may want to double this if you're feeding more than four- they go fast! Update- I've made this now with just about every kind of apple. I've made it with and without onions. Last time I grated a carrot and finely chopped celery in with the apple. I have used panko crumbs Italian style crumbs and once in a pinch stuffing (oh yum). I haven't been able to screw it up no matter how I try- oh and I use honey dijon not regular because that's what's here. The real secret is the apple and maple. The apple keeps everything tender so don't worry if you don't have an onion use powder.",

The sauce was spot on the type of Dijon was not specified so I used the grainy kind and it looked nice too. The apple/onion mixture to top the burgers with was good maybe a bit oily but the bite and sweet together was pleasant. I used a red onion as I wanted to use it up. The burgers themselves I found a little bland but my guests said they were delicious. I was out of Italian seasoning but made up my own using the \"Italian Seasoning I\" recipe with modifications. Chicken isn't a naturally flavourful meat so I was a little surprised at the few spices involved. The maple syrup or its sweetness did come through the burger at all. The apples in the meat mixture also did not add anything taste or texture-wise. I will definitely season the burgers differently next time but overall these are quite tasty. My rating is 3.5/5 my guests 4/5.",
