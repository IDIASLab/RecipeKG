It\u2019s warm, comforting, and flavorful, and then as a bonus, it\u2019s quick and easy.   I did add a few more red pepper flakes, but that\u2019s personal taste, otherwise, wouldn\u2019t change a thing.  I\u2019m finding I like Israeli couscous more and more, and this is yet another recipe that incorporates that ingredient.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Lirby10, it was a hit in this house!",
