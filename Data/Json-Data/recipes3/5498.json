I put everything in a zip-lock bag and didn't even bother with turning/manipulating it. I just left it alone and everything seemed to marinate evenly. I did use white balsamic vinegar found at Trader Joe's so everything maintained their own lovely color. I added a chopped fuji apple for added crunch/texture as well as little cubes of calabrese (hot/spicy salami) and dried cranberries as suggested by another user to help balance the tang. To bump it up a notch it tastes even better if you toast the baguette slices in a skillet with a little olive oil just prior to serving. This is a very adaptable and forgiving recipe that the whole family enjoyed even the kids. Thank you for sharing it with us.",
