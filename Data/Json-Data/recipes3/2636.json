Well this recipe has answered my tuna cravings. I made a number of taste changes though....added much more mayo red onion sweet relish pepper powdered mustard to taste and the secret ingredient - sea salt. I tried it on crackers for a taste test then refrigerated and made a \"tuna melt\" sandwich the following day. Yum! Who needs to eat a real fish? Thanks for the great idea!",

First as someone else mentioned in a review I used lowfat plain yogurt instead of mayo. I also added 1 tsp. of capers and used india relish instead of sweet pickle relish (it's just a little spicier). I had to go back and add about a teaspoon of mayo; the yogurt didn't do it for me. But I guess it reduces the fat content significantly to use mostly yogurt and a little mayo. Will definitely make it again!",

However I love chickpeas/garbanzo beans. I just made this recipe for lunch today and like it very much! I'd suggest mashing it with a fork (or even a sturdy pastry cutter) if you like texture. I didn't have green onions so took a little of a regular onion and minced it. I also didn't have canned chick peas and so soaked the dried ones over night and cooked them this morning before making this. That texture may possibly be different from canned. Canned would save time! I will definitely be making this from time to time. It's a great change for lunch! Thanks for submitting it.",

I didn't rinse the garbanzo beans (reserved a lot of the flavor I think) and I mashed them with a potato masher. Instead of using regular mayo I used Nayasoya Nayonnaise (vegan soy mayo--has 35 calories instead of 100 like regular mayo) instead of the regular stuff. Tasted great! I think a little celery and cumin would also taste good in there. Will try that next time. And there will definately be a next time! Thanks Carole!;-)",
