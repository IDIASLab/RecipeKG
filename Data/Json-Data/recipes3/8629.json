While it is very good and it's nice comfort food I felt it needed \"something\" -- whether some spice fewer noodles something. I am still unsure. However I had a lot of it so shared it with others who liked it better than I did. My best use of it was for breakfast though; I beat up a couple of eggs mixed in some of the recipe food put it in the frying pan and sprinkled cheese on top. Fabulous this way!! Plus I think it covers all the food groups LOL.",

I cooked turkey kielbasa cut into slices first and once the meat was a little brown removed it and added the butter to the pan with the small amount of drippings for added flavor. I then saut\u00e9ed the apple with some thinly sliced and chopped Vidalia onion before adding coleslaw mix for the cabbage and carrots. I returned the kielbasa to the cabbage mix added salt and pepper to taste and once this cooked in the butter for the 12 minutes or so I added it to the egg noodles. It was delicious!!",
