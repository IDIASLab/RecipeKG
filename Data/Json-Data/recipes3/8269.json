Next time, I would also take care to LIGHTLY coat the chicken with the flour mixture making sure to shake of excess.  The coating on mine was a little too thick but the dish still tasted great.  My friend and I used to love going to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch and would order chicken marsala. I feel accomplished being able to make it on my own just as good!!
