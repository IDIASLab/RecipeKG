You can adjust the ingredients based on whether you like it more hot or more sweet, and you can make sugar free, fat free versions, too!  I got this recipe from my mother, and it's been a family favorite for years! If you do not have time to let the apricot mixture chill overnight, it will still taste delicious served immediately.
