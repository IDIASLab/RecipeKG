(If you can find in a local store Taco meat it is perfect and already cut) These can so good cold with catsup for days. I use 2 # of meat and about the same amount of potatoes (not in pounds but diced up 1/4 inch) and appears to be the same as meat. In a blender with water I mix my carrots and onions the strain for at least 1 or more hours. Season with salt pepper and if you can get it Vegeta which can be found in European stores.",
