These were excellent! I really think these could be baked on a cookie sheet sprayed with non-stick with the same if not better results. Frying makes such a mess and as written these patties hold their shape SO well that I think it is worth a try. Better for you that way with half the hassle. I am far from being a vegetarian but if I were I'd lose the Worcestershire and make these at least once a week. Great and unexpected flavor and a recipe I will make often.",

The proportions seemed off since the recipe calls for portions of vegetables which can vary in size wildly. Using actual measurements like 1/2 cup rather than 1/2 onion would help with this. Additionally, I used russet potatoes for the baked potatoes since I assumed the the potatoes' starch was the binder and they have the most. However, it was NOT enough. This recipe needs at least 1-2 eggs to keep the patties together and for them to be thinner. I had to make them quite thick to try to keep them together and they still fell apart. Overall, I loved the concept and the taste but this recipe needs some tweaking to perfection.",
