I only added garlic and (red) onion to the ground beef( no lime juice no cilantro) but I think I would add those ingredients next time. And the combination of guacamole with melted Monterey Jack cheese is delicious on a burger... who knew? My Mom loved hers and I can't wait to try these on hubby when he gets back into town. By the way this recipe was chosen as one of the weekly dishes for our cooking club on 9/3 and it went over really well. Thanks for the recipe!",
