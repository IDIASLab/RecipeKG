I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and pounded them so that they were uniform in thickness.  I marinated the chicken for 2 days & grilled them about 3 1/2 minutes per side.  I garnished the platter with lemon halves, roasted heads of garlic & sprigs of fresh rosemary.  My only suggestion is to be careful with the fresh oregano...it is very pungent, so don't get carried away!!",

The first time I made this I only used two breasts but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. I marinated for an hour and then cooked them on the George Foreman grill - delicious! The 2nd time I made four breasts w/the same amount of marinade - not quite as flavorful but still very good. I recommend adding more spices & garlic than the recipe calls for if you like a stronger flavor.",
