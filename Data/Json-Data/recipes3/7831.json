I was always so fond of this dish growing up, being that it was always available at family parties and my grandma's was hands down, the best! Some changes I made: I sauteed the onion, garlic, and tomatoes with patis(fish sauce) then added the pork. I added 1 cup of water with 1 tbs of bagoong alamang(no shrimp or prawns). I used butternut squash, because bitter melon is just not for me or my family. And I added zuchinni cubes. Brought everything to a medium boil for 15mins. But these are just my preferences, thanks for sharing :)",
