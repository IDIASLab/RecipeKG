This was pretty good but I would go with dill pickle or relish in place of the cucumber for a little added flavor. Also I like to add a little paprika for the color. I think I would also use a red onion or green onions just because the yellow onion I used was really potent could be I added a little to much but the onion flavor was very strong. Thanks so much for sharing.",
