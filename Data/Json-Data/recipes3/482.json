I don't know why some had trouble with it setting up. Her recipe even had a bit more milk in it but her preparation of ingredients are different and does not include van. extract. Her version is:A large bag of oreo's finely crushed. In a small bowl mix 1-8oz.softened cream cheese 1/2 stick marg. and 1 cup confectioners sugar. Set aside. In a large bowl mix 2 pkg. instant vanilla pudding and 3 1/2 cups cold milk. Beat until thick add 12oz. coolwhip and mix. Add cream cheese mixture and beat together. I have never had problems with it.Layer the same as this one. I served in a large plastic flower pot with no hole in the bottom and put some plastic artificial flowers on top. It is so cute with the worms poking through. It is very rich and a real conversation piece. Young and old enjoy this! Thanks Kym!",
