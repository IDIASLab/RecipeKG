Instead of dredging in flour and then the egg/cheese mixture I omit the flour altogether and just dredge the eggplant in egg then in the cheese/spices mixture before frying. Instead of rolling it up I just layer slices in the pan (with some sauce in the bottom of the dish) and put the cheese/spinach mixture on top and then cover with the remaining sauce.

Fresh garlic would probably be good. i put mushroom slices in the botom of the pan with the sauce. Fairly easy dish - Make it your own.",
