                "reviewBody": "2.26.19 Followed the recipe to the letter and although these mashed potatoes turned out OK not sure I totally understand this recipe. You re going to mash the potatoes so why take the time to slice into 1/4 rounds rather than just cutting them into chunks then into the pot? Since you're mashing anyway why slices? Why use 2 cups of chicken stock then drain and reserve the stock and then not told what to do with the reserved stock? And why steam the potatoes? Honestly I really couldn t taste any flavor from the chicken stock from steaming so I have to wonder why not just use all water or perhaps half water and half stock covering the potatoes then boil rather than steam? I think the chicken stock flavor would be infused into the potatoes better this way. I now have well over a cup of chicken stock sitting on the counter (I used Kitchen Basics the brand that has been used in every cooking class that I ve taken) which seems wasteful to me. After mashing the potatoes really didn t need additional liquid so using some of that reserved broth wasn t an option but I did add the cream cheese. I used my food processor to slice the potatoes so that now has to be washed as well as the steaming rack neither of which would have been necessary had the potatoes been boiled. Admittedly the potatoes tasted pretty good I did like the addition of the saut\u00e9ed garlic. Just think this could have been simplified.",

With that being said I didn't dirty up my mandolin but rather just cubed my potatoes. I also used all water instead of wasting chicken stock. I liked the flavor the garlic added and these were okay but the recipe is more complicated than it needs to be. I love my IP but this is a recipe that would have been better done on the stove. Boiling the potatoes in chicken stock would have added a lot more flavor.",
