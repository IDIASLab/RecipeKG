The filets are to thin that I simply coated one filet with the filling and topped it with another before baking. I added some fresh chopped garlic. This dish would benefit from some color. Next time I'll sprinkle either some paprika or parsley on top. Neither will alter the taste of the dish. Thanks for sharing!",

I also could not find any halibut so I used one large piece (about.65 lbs) of Orange Roughy and cut the cream cheese in half. It was enough to feed a family of two adults and 2 toddlers which I served with a salad steamed broccoli and some corn on the cob. Also I used larger cooked cocktail shrimp and cut them in half. I found it helpful to mix the cream cheese with the basil salt and pepper FIRST since I had a hard time incorporating the shrimp without damaging it. I just stuffed the cream cheese mixture with the shrimp randomly and it came out great! Thanks for this recipe. We will definitely be making this again!",
