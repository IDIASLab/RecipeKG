I used halved grape tomatoes and next time will put in more pepperoni (maybe thicker sliced and quartered - they wanted to stick together) and fresh mushrooms instead of jar. I used mini penne and it was really pretty. I served it well chilled (4 hours in fridge) but enjoyed it much more later on at the party when it was lukewarm. I don't think I'll make it ahead next time. But will definitely be making it again (and again and again)",

Also I added ALMOST 1/4c of the dressing to the salad while refrigerating to keep the noodles from clumping together which I think enhanced the flavor. When it came time to serve added the remaining dressing and per the suggestion of a friend that was over I mixed in 1 TBLS of white sugar which added a very subtle touch of sweetness!",
