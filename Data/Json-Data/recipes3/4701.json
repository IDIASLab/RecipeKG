Both she and her mother pepared this unique and colorful recipe with all the leftover vegetables and ham from the traditional New England Boiled Dinner.  The potatoes, carrots, turnip, cabbage and ham along with beets and onions, were ground altogether through a meat grinder and fried with butter in a cast iron skillet.  The condiment of choice was vinegar that was sprinkled on top for those that enjoyed that flavor. \n\nThis recipe brings back many memories and the flavors are vivid reminders of living in the simple life in the country.",

I was so happy when I came across this recipe. So my only change was to use fresh beets instead of canned. I loved the crust that it formed on the bottom from the butter yum! Was a perfect compliment to the ham slices and baked beans I served it with. Next time I might add carrots and onions as another reviewer had mentioned as well as a couple tablespoons of milk to keep it moist as it is browning. Thank you TiredMom of Six for sharing this recipe.",
