After 2 hours on low it looked the same as when I put it in the pot. I then set the cooker to medium checked again at 1 more hour (now at 3) same thing. I scooped out as much of the broth as I could increased the temp to high set for another 1-1/2 hours (now at a total of 4-1/2 hours cooking) I then used a slotted spoon and put the stuffing into a casserole dish baked at 375\u00baF for 1 hr 15 mins trying to bake off the moisture but still ended up with a dish of mushy stuffing. The problem here is simple: TOO MUCH BROTH! All of the ingredients are complementary traditional stuffing ingredients but they need the right measurements. A lot of time went into preparation not to mention the actual cost. This was a huge disappointment.",
