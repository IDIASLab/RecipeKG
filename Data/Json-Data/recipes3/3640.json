This particular pastasciutta is somewhat of a classic in a style I grew up with and love. Don't bother to measure ingredients precisely just season with the garlic butter to taste and add some olive oil too if you like. Save some of the pasta cooking water in case the pasta gets dry once tossed. To add a little color I also added some finely chopped fresh parsley. And I would agree this is even better with a sprinkling of good Parmesan or Romano cheese.",
