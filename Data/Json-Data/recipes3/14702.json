I was concerned about the moisture in the zucchini creating a somewhat liquidy texture (especially since the recipe doesn't state to squeeze out extra moisture from the zucchini) and I was right to be concerned. It was kinda sloppy even after cooling. I also ended up baking it about 50 minutes total because I used a 9\" pie pan instead of 6x10\" dish. Overall I would make it again but I would definitely squeeze out the extra moisture from the zucchini first. And pre-cook the bacon before crumbling it up into the egg mixture--just so it stays a bit crisper.",
