I also broke the graham crackers into fourths when I put them in the bottom of the pan.  When they got set up in the fridge, I flipped them out upside down on parchment and cut them apart where the seams of the graham crackers were.  That makes them perfect finger food sized treats.  Then I store them upside down in the pan so the graham crackers stay crispy (never tried them the other way).  I also take them out of the fridge an hour or so before serving, so the marshmallow/chocolate part are softer.  Everyone loves these!",
