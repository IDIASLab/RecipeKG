Doubled the amount of fresh garlic used (we love garlic at our house) 3.) Add a half cup of Parmesan to the mixture. 4.) Diced Roma tomatoes on top of the mixture after it's in the shells (but BEFORE baking) 5.) Shredded mozzarella on top of the tomatoes. These changes resulted in an absolutely delicious winner of a recipe that is on my permanent keep list.",

Then threw in 16 oz. spinach (squeezing the life out of it first). Turn off the stove and added 5 oz. garlic & herb feta cheese and 1/2 of grated parmesan cheese. While the oven is preheating I filled 15 mini phyllo cups (one package) with the filling added diced tomato on top and topped it off with mozzerella cheese. Baked it for about 8-9 mins. at 350 to melt the cheese and get the phyllo cups crisp! OMG can't tell you how delicious it was! I made 30 cups in all but still have enough filling for another 15 cups which I'll be back in the store picking more up tomorrow! Thanks for the sharing this great recipe!",

I thought that 30 to 40 of these little guys would be way to much but I figured we would eat them as left overs anyway. Well they came out absolutely perfect. I chop my garlic so that its in fairly large chunks and I basically doubled the amount because we love garlic so much. These things had the perfect blend of flavors and we ended up eating all of them with the meal. I give this recipe 5 stars for being quite simple quick to make and having wonderful flavor. A great appetizer or even just a healthy snack on rainy afternoons.",
