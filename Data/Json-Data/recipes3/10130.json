Also, I added a jalape\u00f1o to the rest of the veggies because someone else said it was missing a zest and that truly made the recipe work! Also I added more pepper than the recipe states and a bunch of \u201cDash\u201d (salt free, original). I added a little bit more Swiss cheese too. Lastly I used a hand blender because I wanted some chunkyness to the soup. Soooo tasty!  Put all the extra hot hot soup into jars and now they will keep for weeks. Will make again for sure.",
