I followed others' suggestions and added a couple cloves of minced garlic; plus, I used pureed fresh pumpkin in place of the roasted pumpkin chunks and doubled the amount of chicken. Before adding the parmesan, I sprinkled in some fresh grated nutmeg to bring out the natural sweetness in the pumpkin and onion. It was really delicious and easy to make. Definitely a keeper! Next time, I am going to try it with some chicken apple sausage I found at the supermarket in place of the roasted chicken breast.",
