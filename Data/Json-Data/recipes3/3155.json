My recipe varies slightly from Don's.\nIn addition to the fresh hocks and veal, I boil as many pigs feet as will fit in the kettle without overcrowding. I've never used nutmeg in mine but I'm going to try it next time. I also add some pickling spice, and extra vinegar. Be careful not to boil the kettle hard, just a light simmer until the meat falls off the bone. Occasionally I have to add some unflavored gelatin to get it to set up, not sure why.   Like Don, sadly I'm the only one left in my family that likes souse. Just thinking about it is making me hungry, I see a trip to the butcher shop in my future.\nDave",
