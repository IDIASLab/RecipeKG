I coated the chicken with lightly seasoned flour prior to browning them. After the breasts were cooked, I removed them from the pan and saut\u00e9ed 2 minced cloves of garlic, \u00bd of an onion, chopped, and 1 cup of sliced mushrooms until the onion was soft and the mushrooms were mostly cooked. Then I added the cream, mustard and tarragon with the garlic, onions, and mushrooms. I also tripled the cream-mustard-tarragon \u201cgravy\u201d as we like extra. I served this wonderful chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. We will definitely make this again!  UPDATE: I have made this dish again, and this time I made a few more changes that previous reviewers had mentioned. I rubbed a light coating of Dijon mustard on the chicken breasts a few hours before cooking and let them sit. I still coated the breasts in seasoned flour before browning. Once the chicken was cooked and I removed it from the pan, I added a splash of white wine (slightly less than a quarter cup) to deglaze the pan prior to saut\u00e9ing the onions, garlic and mushrooms. My husband said it was the best! This time I served it with Stove-Top chicken dressing and a salad.",

PLUS, after removing the chicken I deglazed the pan with dry white wine, after it reduced by half I added finely chopped shallots.  After the shallots cooked for a few minutes I then added the cream.  Instead of tarragon in the sauce I added Herbes de Provence, stirred then added back the chicken.  I garnished the chicken with fresh chopped tarragon.  We used the sauce for the asparagus on the side.  My kids (10 & 12) loved the sauce and the chicken.  They actually used the sauce to disguise the taste of the asparagus.  This is a keeper recipe and I've shared it with friends.  Nice and easy but definitely a show stopper.\r\n\r\n",

I changed it some based on the reviews and on our dietary needs: Marinate the chicken breasts for a few hours in white wine and lemon juice. Convection bake at 325 for 20 minutes while making sauce. (These two pre-steps tenderize the chicken.) In a sauce pan melt 1 TBS unsalted butter and add about 1/4 cup diced red onions cooking a few minutes. Add about 1/3 cup sliced portabello mushrooms and saute until mushrooms are cooked. Pour into bowl and set aside. Pour 1/2 cup of fat-free half & half to heated saute pan and heat on medium until hot. Whisk into cream 2 TBS Dijon mustard. Stir in 2 TBS chopped fresh Tarragon. Add in onion-mushroom mixture and lower heat to a low simmer. Place baked breasts on a lightly greased heated grill pan and grill 3 minutes each side or until chicken is cooked through. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on plates and ladle sauce on top. Voila! A gourmet meal awaits.",
