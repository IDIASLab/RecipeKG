I added green onions to the veggie mix and sprinkled some cheddar just before adding the eggs (made the top get nice and crispy) so therefore skipped the butter. Also I took the advice of one person and mixed the eggs together before pouring. I'll make it again but with black beans which I think would be tastier. Oh I also added cayenne pepper for a little extra kick and I think it might be bland without it. The dish did come out just a bit dry maybe I cooked it a little too long- so I ate it with ketchup. Good stuff thank you Bounty!",
