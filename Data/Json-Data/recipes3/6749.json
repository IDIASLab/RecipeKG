It probably would have been better with Imae's suggestion to add things like cranberries and celery as suggested. The apple started going brown quickly so I added a little lemon juice to stop it. I also replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil and cut down on the amount of it. The kids didn't enjoy it but ate it reluctantly (only because I told them I spent a long time cutting and grating the ingredients). But definitely would probably appeal more to health conscious adults than kids.",
