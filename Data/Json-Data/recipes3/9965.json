In lieu of \"salad seasoning mix\" I used Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt tho' I think many seasoning blends would work just fine. I really have no clue what \"dill seasoning mix\" is so I used fresh dill. I chose to add red bell pepper with its sweeter milder flavor than green pepper and I omitted the carrots because we're not fond of them. I chose to chop rather than mash the eggs. Very nice!",
