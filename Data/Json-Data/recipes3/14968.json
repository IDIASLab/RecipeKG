                "reviewBody": "I was really wanting another handy breakfast cookie recipe. When I made the recipe exactly as is it was too watery to make a cookie. I even waited 10-15 minutes to see if the oatmeal and tapioca would soak up some more of the liquid. So I ended up having to add 3/4 cup white whole wheat flour. I decided to then just make a bar cookie and poured it into a prepared 9x9 pan. When it cooled I cut into 25 even squares. I tasted it and it was like an apple spice cake with chocolate chips. Maybe ingredient brands vary? If not then an ingredient may possibly missing? Made as is here each serving equalled 135 calories. I thought it was okay. My husband did not like the combination of apple apple spice flavor and chocolate. I can not eat a whole pan by myself so unfortunately some will end up getting tossed. I liked the idea of a fruit based breakfast cookie. Maybe nuts would work better instead of chocolate though. However I rated it a 3 because I would love to see how others fare with this turning into a cookie or how they were able to adjust the recipe properly or not.",
