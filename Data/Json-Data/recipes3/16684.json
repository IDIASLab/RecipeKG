I used white basmati rice, and a 12 oz. boneless skinless chicken breast (pan cooked).  Most of the ingredients are things I already keep in stock, so didn't require a trip to the grocery store.  The different flavors came through, and it was also visually appealing.  I just served it with a green salad.  Definitely will prepare this again.",
