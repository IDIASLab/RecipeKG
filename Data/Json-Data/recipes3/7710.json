I mixed it up last night (except the corn flakes...I added those in right before I baked it) to save time today. I followed the recipe exactly except I was cooking for only 4 people so I halved the recipe and put it in an 11x7 casserole dish instead of a ring mold. Everyone loved it! It was very tasty and a nice change from the same ole same ole. The only thing I would recommend is to run the carrots through a food processor instead of a mixer. Much easier and quicker that way. Otherwise it was very easy. Thanks for sharing this recipe! I'll be making it again for Thanksgiving.",
