I also saute the onions and more garlic first. Since it seems a little too greasy I will try decreasing the oil next time to 1/4 cup or less. And if you turn up the oven temp. you can forget toasting the sesame seeds beforehand since they will get brown. I also add more bread crumbs 1/2 to 3/4 cup.",
