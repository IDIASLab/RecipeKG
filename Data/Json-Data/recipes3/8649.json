The coconut surprisingly complimented the meats and was pretty tasty. However the mango in the middle was a little too sweet for me. I think that when I fried the rolls the sweet flavor from the coconut dripped into the center and the mango absorbed it. Overall I think it tasted good but the center was a little too sweet. Also my family loved it. My dad went on and on about how delicious it was. He loved it so much that he decided he would clean up. However this meal was very time-consuming. It took at least 45 minutes sitting in the refrigerator and another 20 minutes to fry the rolls. On top of that I had to bake it for another 20 minutes.",
