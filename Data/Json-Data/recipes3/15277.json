I sprayed some cooking spray on my hands when I went to shape the balls because I found that the dough was very sticky. Worked really well.",

They puff up a lot in the oven leaving these air pockets of gooey goodness inside. Thank you for the recipe!",

HINT: my batter was very soupy, I think because I missed the step of stirring in the tapioca starch/flour when you take the hot half and half mixture off the stove and rather stirred it in about 20 minutes later. HOWEVER: I pulled out my mini muffin tin, sprayed it with olive oil, and poured in the batter. They baked up to perfection! (I will say this misstep made making them easier as I didn't have to deal with the gloppy batter and rolling them into balls.  I may even do this the next time I make them.) I will definitely make them again.",

This recipe saved the day and was used for my actual Brazilian themed dinner 1-2 weeks later. I used coconut milk as I cannot tolerate regular milk but I think any plant based milk would work. I forgot to let the dough rest one time and the bread was still good but much better if you let it rest a little. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!",

Final preparation, used a little EVO on a barking prep mat and gloves to form the dough into a single roll. Cut the roll into 12 sections of about 2.5 inches. Then rolled them by hand into balls. Placed them on a 1/2 sized baking sheet with parchment paper. Results were perfect. Brazilian guest said that they were very authentic. They stole the show!  Thank you for sharing.
