Second I used the Bob Evans sausage and cranberry stuffing from this site and it was delicious. (It might be even a little better to use 100% homemade stuffing but that's a big undertaking). I put the top back on the pumpkin before I put it in the oven and the stuffing pushed it up an inch or so as it swelled which made for a great presentation. I used a small pumpkin and cut it into slices to serve - it was a hit!",

I used this to serve individual servings of stuffing on Thansgiving using gluten free stuffing in small pumpkins to avoid any contamination. It worked like a charm. I cooked it the night before refrigerated then reheated in the microwave the next day. It was a hit with everyone. I now have served this to my family on regular occasions. Everyone raves about it and the kids get some veggies in them from eating the pumpkin. In my latest attempt (in my picture) I used two very small Kuri pumpkins and had to take out some of the pulp to make room for all the stuffing. I chopped up the pulp and added it into the stuffing and the flavor was really wonderful. I used homemade gluten free stuffing from AR one time and then used homemade cornbread stuffing in another. The flavor of the pumpkin is just delicious and not overpowering. Thank you Karen for a lovely idea and a no fuss easy recipe idea!",
