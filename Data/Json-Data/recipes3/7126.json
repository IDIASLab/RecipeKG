The second time I made this soup, I used a yogurt garnish - in a squirt bottle. The yogurt was a fine alternative addition & floated as nicely as the cream. The cream & parsley are mostly for beautiful presentation. I found that the parsley sprig actually detracted from the soup's lovely smoothness, & tasted like its chlorophyll. I think a better green garnish is some thinly sliced green onions - the raw onion's enzymes actually help better digest cooked potato! I highly recommend this soup.",
