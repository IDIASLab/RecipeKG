I've also used a similar method with swiss chard and spinach, but never tried it with balsamic vinegar. That adds a real tasty touch! Note that the recipe says to cook the kale until half of the volume is reduced. Don't over cook it - it's healthier that way!! You don't want it to end up like a wet rag. There should still be a hint of crispness to the leaves. Also, toss the kale a few times and it won't burn. The water on the leaves from washing should be enough. Simple, tasty and good for you!!!",

If you are a novice at cooking kale, like I was a while ago, you need to strip the leaves off the stems and also chop the leaves a bit before cooking. You should add a small amount of water when cooking the kale and watch carefully so it doesn't boil away and burn. This recipe is very easy and has a really nice flavor.  Thank you so much!",

Also, it helps to have half of the olive oil in the pan when you're cooking the kale, to help it from sticking.  Also, add 1/2 cup of water and cover the pan- this will ensure that the kale doesn't burn.  The water will evaporate off at the end, leaving nicely sauteed kale.",
