I omit the poppy seeds and add a ribbon of 1/4 c chopped walnuts 1/2 c sugar and 2 T brown sugar and 2 T cinnamon to the middle. I just pour 1/2 the batter in the pan sprinkle the mixture over the batter and pour the rest on top. Same baking. Adds a nice touch especially if you like a hint of cinnamon!!",
