All the ingredients blend together deliciously to create a taste sensation. Perfect with the arugula but this could also be tossed with some rigatoni or penne pasta. This is also good enough to eat on its own with a crusty slice of Italian bread for a simple light but satisfying meal. I used all fresh herbs from my garden and beautiful shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano. Thank you kimscookingnow for the delicious memories. I have to say that of the 700 recipes I've tried from this site this is by far one of the more memorable. And for what it's worth my German hubby raved about this too!",
