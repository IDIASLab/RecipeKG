This would go well over pasta, served up with some crusty Italian bread.  The taste was wonderful.   I *did* make a some changes; I used four cloves of garlic instead of two; sliced up a stalk of celery and used two carrots (not too thinly sliced, more like 1/2\" or so) instead of one.  Another reason this didn't get a full five stars was prep/cook time.  It is one of my biggest peeves when checking out recipes.  IT took me longer, from start to finish, than the author's total time ~ about 45 minutes.  Not a big deal, but when you want to have dinner on the table at a certain time, it's kind of frustrating.  I will make this again and serve it over pasta next time!",

I used garlic powder and cayenne pepper for seasoning. I let it simmer for about 15 min. and served over rice. Turned out very good. Thanks this will be used again!",
