                "reviewBody": "So easy and so good!  I did change a few things, like using heavy cream in place of milk (3/4 c.) since I had some I needed to get rid of.  Honestly, if I was in a bind, and had neither, I thought the soup would have been fine  without any dairy or extra liquid added (based on both flavor and thickness of the soup).  Depends on your own personal tastes.  I also added an extra carrot, used an eyeballed amount of fresh grated nutmeg, skipped the sherry altogether and added 2-3 tbsp. of parsley to the soup instead of using it as a garnish.  I added it at the same time as the cauliflower.  Finally, I followed others advice and held back a bit of the veggies to add back to the puree. I was so pleased with the versatility of this recipe, that I think I will be using it for a very long time to come.\n\n[Edit: I wrote this review in 2008 and it's now 2014. I'm still making this soup with a few other alterations. I don't bother blending or pureeing this soup at all anymore. I find that I like having a more rustic feel, with bits and chunks from using a potato masher (just mashing until I get a consistency I like). I still skip the dairy completely and I never used the sherry (you just don't really need either of those ingredients, especially the way I make it). I still add the parsley into the soup (nice handful finely chopped, no measuring needed) and also add a medium sized sweet potato (sliced thinly for faster cooking). The sweetness pairs well with the fresh grated nutmeg I use.]",

After the modifications, it was yummy and satisfying.  I should mention that I had no sherry or nutmeg, which could be another reason it needed the modifications.",
