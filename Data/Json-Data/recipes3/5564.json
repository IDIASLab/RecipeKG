My hubby and I just recently have started eating them (and we are over 50!) and we tried another carmelized recipe from here and we are now hooked! So so good! These are a great variation of the other one. I changed it up regarding how I cook them and you might want to try this method as well! Steam the Brussels until tender but still crisp and set aside. Saute a sweet onion in the oil using the same skillet I steamed in on med-high to brown & carmelize the onions. Then add the sprouts and continue to saute adding the vinegar. When almost done & 'roasted looking' add the maple syrup Dijon mustard & cashews if using them plus salt & pepper to taste!",

My kids ate them too (2 and 4 years old) but had to coaxed to eat them. This is an excellent recipe for those trying to find new ways to eat their veggies. I did have to make a couple of alterations out of necessity. I substituted toasted almonds for the cashews and had to substitute honey for half of the maple syrup. While still good I can't wait to try again with all the original ingredients.",
