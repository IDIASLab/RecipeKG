                "reviewBody": "So I have now made this recipe a minimum of about 50 times.  It is our favorite recipe on this site, and my husband's absolute favorite meal.  Having made it so many times, I have tried every variation under the sun, and I have come up with what I think it the most flavorful method. Here are my suggestions:  1. Don't waste time chopping fresh peppers or paying the extra cost.  Buy the bagged frozen red, green, yellow pepper, and onion blend found in most brands.  You will not lose any flavor, and I promise you won't know the difference. 2. Heavy cream is best, but to cut calories 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 ff half/half + 1-2 t. corn starch works, too. 3. Mushrooms aren't necessary, but use baby bellas if you do.  4.  Add more cajun seasoning.  This recipe doesn't call for nearly enough, but you will need to add strictly based upon your taste.  Once everything is added to the sauce, I taste it and keep adding until it tastes just right.  A little extra salt is usually required, as well.  5.  For the meat, I have found two variations that are PERFECT.  Our favorite is to use a rotissiere chicken from the  grocery deli.  Debone, add the meat to the sauce.  YUMMY.  We also like it with a pound of fresh shrimp. 6. Use  3/4 of a box of linguine. Four ounces? Crazy. UPDATE:  Many reviewers complain about the sauce being too thin for this recipe.  Just let the sauce simmer longer, or mix a little corn starch (a tsp.) with small amount of liquid (milk or water) & add it to the sauce.",

The manager provided the recipe to Taste of Home magazine. I made it and loved it! I made this dish when I was snowed in one day.  I substituted many things b/c I couldn't get to the store - I defrosted skinless/boneless chicken from a bulk freezer pack.  I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh, and I had to make my own cajun seasoning since I didn't have that either (1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp. onion salt, 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to make 1 TBS Cajun seasoning).  I added Tobasco sauce and did need to add 1 tsp. flour to thicken the sauce.  I also omitted the green and red peppers and lemon-pepper seasoning, b/c, surprise! I didn't have those in the house either.  However, overall it was EXCELLENT and my fiance and I finished all of it.  I will definitely be making this again. Tasted just like Fettucini New Orleans that you can order in restaurants.",

Once in a while, I'll suprise the family as a special treat as everyone likes it!  Couple of things could use improvement....  Use fresh minced garlic vs garlic powder ~ using fresh helps the recipe develop different levels of complexity beyond the Cajun seasoning.   Instead of green peppers, I usually substitute Anaheim, Pasilla or Hatch chili peppers when I can find them (Hatch chilis can be found in Hatch Valley, NM, and are wonderful).  I also increase the amount of Cajun seasoning to taste and add 1/2 tsp of onion powder.  The sauce is thin; good, but quite thin as many other reviewers have noted.  To avoid the thinness, make a roux using flour, butter and some of the sauce.  Please note:  It's important to let the roux cook down to a beautiful golden color before adding it back to the sauce otherwise you will taste the flour in it.  Thanks Tammy for the submission.",

This made about four servings. I think it would be wonderful in the summer w/ lots of fresh veggies. may add baby spinach next time or broccoli... thank you so much for this recipe!!!",

This fed all three of us (the kids ate most of it with my not feeling so good) and the boys and I just loved it. Huge hit. I do think that it would not have been as good had I not increased the spices. Next time, I'll add more mushrooms.

Because of the comments about it being bland I did add more cajun seasoning and more cayanne pepper. We like spicy! I can't afford the calories so I used Land O Lakes Fat Free Half and Half and no one would know the difference. I use this in Alfredo sauce also. I thickened it with flour and water just like any gravy and it was wonderful. There are so many different cajun spice recipies and the spice would make all the difference in the world as to how bland or spicy your finished dish is. I looked for a spice recipe on line and made my own. I also tossed in a little broccoli at the end for some more color. Corn would also be good! I might try that next time.",

It was first of all very unappetizing to look at.  I used half and half like some of the reviews suggested and it was like we had pasta soup.  The peppers are barely cooked.  My son choked down a little and when my husband came in a little later he would'nt even touch it.  I did double the spices, but it just wasn't any good.  Please note that I've been cooking for years and years so I know how to follow a recipe.  I was just so surprized how yucky this was when there were so many great reviews.",
