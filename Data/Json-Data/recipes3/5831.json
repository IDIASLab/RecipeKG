I had some left over roasted chicken and decide I wanted to make a quick chicken salad out of. I reduced the menu for 4 servings and used: 1/2 tsp of McCormick Garlic and Herb seasoning in place of Fresh Rosemary. 1/2 Cup of chopped almonds instead of walnuts. 1/4 cup of Feta instead of Blue Cheese. I didn't add any salt because of the saltiness of the Feta but did use fresh cracked black pepper. What a fantastic recipe! It would work great as an appetizer or a dip and the only thing that I might seriously consider adding to it would be a tbsp or a 1/4 cup of raisuns to it. Toasted wheat bread or crescent rolls with lettuce and tomato for a great sandwhich. I highly recommend this recipe both \"as is \" or to experiment with!",

Reviewers who found the rosemary to be overwhelming may not have been using fresh rosemary -- if you are going to use dried rosemary you need to reduce the amount to one teaspoon. My husband doesn't like nuts so I left them out of his portion. He tried one bite with walnuts in it; he agreed that the walnuts are needed to balance the intensity of the blue cheese taste but thought perhaps raisins might do the same thing. I might add some halved grapes or some raisins next time.",
