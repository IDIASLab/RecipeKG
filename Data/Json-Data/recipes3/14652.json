As with all bread puddings, watch your time because you don\u2019t want to overcook and end up with dry pudding.  Unfortunately, I forgot to add the cream cheese, but this was good even without it.  Garnished with a sprinkle of cinnamon and served with a drizzle of cream for a tasty Sunday dessert.",
