I pared the recipe down to get one serving which is 1/4 of a cauliflower. There is no way that provides enough for a \"sandwich\" and especially not half inch thick pieces. The resulting sandwich was half the size of my palm. So I tried the recipe again with half a cauliflower. The result was still a smallish sandwich but in half inch thick slices as per the recipe. I didn't enjoy it at all. If anyone else intends to try this my suggestion is make the slices 1/3\" at most. I might try this again but not today. Mrs Sipple is the recipe submitter and took the beautiful picture. In my opinion those are not half inch slices they're much less.",

I'll add it next time. I never added the \"shredded\" parmesan cheese only because it was too confusing. What's the diff? I also topped the eight \"bread\" patties with the cheddar cheese.
