I did bake for 15 minutes before coating in egg/sauce and flour mix and frying. The tofu was very crispy at that point. I cooled pieces on paper towel to soak up some oil and then coated with Corky's BBQ sauce and placed on a well greased pan and put back in the oven for about 5 minutes. (I'm not sure about broiling) When they came out of the oven I thought they were ruined because they were no longer crispy but I'm telling you the texture is right on! All the consistency of chicken wing meat without big veins hanging out chunks of cartilege and other assorted nasty things associated with actual meat. THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for the first tofu recipe I actually like better than the real thing!!!!",
