I used green chilis rather than green olives and I added a bit of minced garlic and just enough cayenne pepper to give it a tiny bite. I tripled the recipe and took them to the tavern we own for an appetizer. Even the guys were asking for the recipe! It was nice because I could pull them out of the fridge and slice them for serving as I needed them. I thought the longer they were in the fridge, the better they tasted. Habit forming! I will definitely use this recipe a lot.",

One tip that makes the tortillas easier to roll is to heat each tortilla in the microwave for 30 seconds before spreading filling. It softens them up and makes it easier to roll them tight. (Out-of-the-fridge stiff tortillas leave a hole in the center when you roll them.)",

The recipe calls for eight 10\" tortillas--when I made it, I spread the filling just thick enough to cover each tortilla, yet the mixture only covered four tortillas. So if you really need to make eight tortillas' worth, you might consider making a larger batch. I made the filling a day in advance and refrigerated it overnight to allow the flavors to blend--yummy!--then softened it in the microwave for 4 minutes at 20% power.",
