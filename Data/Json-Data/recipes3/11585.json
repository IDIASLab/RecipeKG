I doubled the recipe, and as with others, I used only 2 eggs instead of 3, (4 total for doubled) and I added a mashed banana, ( 2 for doubled recipe) and instead of 3 Tbsp. honey that the recipe called for, I added 2 Tbsp. honey and 2 Tbsp. Agave Nectar Light (doubled recipe).  I also added some extra blueberries.  This was the most interesting muffin I have ever made.  I do a lot of muffin experimenting.  This was a very light and moist muffin.  It was not too salty or eggy as some said.  Because I doubled the recipe, it still only made 12 muffins, and they weren't the normal big, puffy muffins that I normally make.  However, they were the most interesting and tasty muffins ever, and b/c it has coconut flour as a base, which is a protein, since it comes from the coconut meat, it was amazingly filling.  It is definitely worth trying...and it's healthy!!",

I used 2 eggs instead of 3 and I am not a fan of salt so I cut it down to 1/8 tsp. Himalayan salt. I was surprised how good they were. Other reviewers have stated that they didn't find these muffins sweet enough.I thought they were plenty sweet! Everyone's pallet is different if you are not used to eating sweets on a regular basis you will love these muffins. I will definitely make these again. In fact I am going to use this recipe as a base for all my gluten free muffins.",

After reading I substituted: a \"flax egg\" (1 TBL ground flax seed plus 3 TBL water) to avoid an eggy flavor; unsalted ghee instead of butter to reduce salty flavor and be healthier; ran out of regular honey so used spreadable cinnamon honey and dropped the cinnamon spice; sprayed muffin pan with coconut oil cooking spay - let muffins cool for 30 min or so and they came out of pan in one piece. Fresh blueberries used. Super moist and delicious.",

Though they stick super bad to anything they are in so make sure and use some kind of pan spray (even in the papers). I doubled the recipe using only 4 eggs instead of 6 replaced butter with applesauce and used half almond flour half coconut flour. I also used quite a bit more honey than what was listed because honey tends to lose sweetness once baked. They could be sweeter but overall they are pretty tasty the way I made them.",

I did a 1/4 cup blueberries. And I did 4 egg whites instead of 3 full eggs. I don t think I m forgetting any of the adjustments I made but when i calculated it all out it came out to around 50 calories per muffin and when I made the batch it made 5 muffins.:) hope that helps.
