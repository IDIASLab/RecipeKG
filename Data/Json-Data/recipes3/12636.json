The diced tomatoes added a bright touch to the dish. I also ground my own chicken thighs as I don't care for the taste of store-bought ground chicken. I also served it over brown basmati rice with Greek yogurt and chopped cilantro, and Naan. Very hearty and tasty. I'm sure to make it again. Thanks, Hunt's!",

I does not make as much as one might think but it's very good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not spicy hot enough for my taste. The finishing touches of the yogurt and cilantro are key. I'm sure the leftovers will be better tomorrow.",

It was OK but not as good as I had hoped. I've had many coconut & tomato based curries before but this didn't seem familiar to any that I can recall. The best I can describe it is like a mashup of Indian & Thai curries. I did serve it over a whole grain rice I don't normally use (MinuteRice) that wasn't up to par but I accounted for that in my rating. I wish I could be more specific in what it was lacking but I can't put my finger on it. I probably won't make this again nor would I order it in a restaurant but I'd certainly eat it if someone cooked it for me.",
