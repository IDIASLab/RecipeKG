Usually though my family doesn't really like them for various reasons - too dry too bland etc but there were no complaints from this recipe. I used some leftover rice instead of the breadcrumbs because I didn't have any but the most important part is to get the best peperoni you can as that's where the flavour and the extra moistness comes from. All in all quick versatile and tasty - a keeper!",

I imagine if you upped the spices (add some Italian seasoning and more garlic you could used ground turkey and have some pepperoni turkey burgers. I may try that next time.
