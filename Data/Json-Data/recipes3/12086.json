Got best results by: reducing the amount of salt to 1 1/2 tsp divided; cutting the amount of olive oil down to 2 1/2 tbs; reducing the oven temperature to 375 on the convection roast setting, for  no more than 25-30 minutes, mixing the chickpeas every 10 minutes; adding whole cumin seeds ( to taste); and adding a pinch or two of red pepper flakes. Make sure you keep a close watch on the mixture and remove as soon as you hear the sound of the peas rattling on the pans as you mix them. You'll notice the difference from the sound they make after the 10 and 20 minute mixes. It's worth the effort for this addictive snack!",
