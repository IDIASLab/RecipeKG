I really liked all of the different flavors going on however I wasn't thrilled with them all being blended together into a puree. Not only was the color not very appetizing it stayed mushy inside the eggroll. If I were to make these again I'd mince some of the veggies and fold them into the tofu mixture. Again great flavor but not a great execution.",
