I made the dressing up in a big glass bowl and dumped the kale in there (I did cheat and use the pre-washed pre cut bag stuff) to mix.  I was out of Siracha but the Chili Lime Cholula worked great!!  I finished with pink  fine ground Himalayan Sea Salt (Costco). I ate almost 1 of the pans myself, while it was still warm!  If you put your kale in the dressing bowl, you get more even coverage of all the bits, than if you drizzle it over and toss it. The downside to cheating and using the bag stuff, more rib than you might do yourself, but still tastes great!",
