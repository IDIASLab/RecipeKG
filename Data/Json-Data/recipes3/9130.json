                "reviewBody": "This is adequate but not very good.  There are a few ways to make oven potatoes crisp and delicious, unfortunately this recipe doesn't touch on any of them.\n\nSoak the potatoes in cold water after they are cut or parboil (bring to a boil then continue to cook on medium heat, more than a simmer but below a roiling boil) for five minutes)  then drain.  Shake the potatoes in the pot to break or frill the edges, then coat with butter or olive oil - duck fat is great here too.\n\nCook in a very hot oven (425-450) for about 20 minutes, turn and continue continue cooking until desired doneness.\n\nYou can skip the frilling, but the blunted edges give the potatoes more crispiness and it's easy to coat them in the same pot.  You can also sprinkle a teaspoon or two of flour on the frilled potatoes before adding the fat,  this creates more browning and crispiness.\n\nThere are endless variations in seasoning, use whatever you like or go simple with salt and ground pepper. \n\nThe extra step of soaking or parboiling results in genuinely crisp on the outside, creamy smooth on the inside delicious potatoes that will be in great demand.\n\nI use russet potatoes as suggested by Serious Eats.",
