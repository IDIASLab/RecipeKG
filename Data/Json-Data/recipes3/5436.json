First I didn't have all the herbs/spices this recipe called for so I used Montreal Stek Spice dill garlic and pepper instead. I didn't have pepperjack cheese so I used Havarty instead which was wonderful! Instead of bread crumbs I put some Ritz crackers in my food processor with the above spices and cheese and pulsed it untill it was fine. Then I just worked it all together with my fingers formed it into balls and placed them in a deep baking dish. I made Sweet and Sour Sacue II from this site and poured it over the top. I baked them at 350 for about 30 mins. Finally I served this over white rice. Great recipe! Loved the addition of cheese in the Meatballs. YUM!!!:)",

Then place in a massive pot and cover until they're ready to serve.\n\nyou need a big (100 litre) pot to mix this  much mixture - don't be afraid of the quantites of herbs etc - it scales perfectly.\n\nI served these with one of the roasted vegetables recipes on here - the meatballs are very juicy but could have done with a tomato sauce or similar.\n\nThis recipe was so good I had 3 or 4 vegetarians who 'lapsed' to try them - one of them ended up eating 8 of them!!",
