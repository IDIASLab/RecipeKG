The olive oil amount has to be doubled in the recipe! Then it truely is perfect in my opinion. I used leaf lettuce roma tomatoes and an English cucumber. I also did about 1/2 the recipe and it did not seem to be a problem. Other than that I followed the recipe except I didn't add any black pepper because I don't care for it. After we started eating it I realized I forgot to add the garlic! Either way it was tasty so I guess it was a fine mistake. Plus I didn't have to worry about garlic breath after dinner. Great simple salad. Try it just remember to double the olive oil!",
