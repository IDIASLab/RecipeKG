Next time I'll use fresh green beans and steam them until they're almost done before adding them to this recipe. The recipe itself is tasty; it's a lighter and fresher taste than the traditional green bean mushroom soup casserole. The orange juice and cranberries add a nice tart/sweet complement to the dish. I also added a little bacon to the dish which was good, but not necessary. I might add a little corn starch to the liquid in the pan so that the sauce clings to the beans more, sort of a glaze.",
