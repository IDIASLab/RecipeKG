I used that as my chicken stock.  I also boiled the asparagus for a few minutes in the stock, before adding it to  the mix.  I sauted the celery with the onion and added 2 cloves of garlic.  I also added salt, pepper and basil along with the oregeno.  My biggest diversion from the recipe was the addition of cream of mushroom.  When I added the sour cream, it became very grainy and watery, so the cream of mushroom definitely helped.  I think any cream of would do.  I mixed everything together, and didn't layer it as described.  finally, I topped it with a fancy shredded parm and romano.",

I also substituted 1/2 cup basil (or cilantro) for oregano because those spices are our favorites and oregano is pretty bland. I also added some monterey jack and some crushed french fried onions to the top after putting it all together in the pan, I used a 9x13 casserole dish.  This was one of the best dishes I've ever made and will certainly make it many times in the future. My husband also loved it.",

This is a yummy casserole!!!  I used fat reduced sourcream and wholegrain egg noodles.",

What I changed was in response to the reviews as to it being runny. Instead of using chicken stock, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also sauteed the asparagus along with the onions and added garlic and mushrooms, omitted the red pepper (yuck!). Then instead of putting it in a casserole, I dumped it all in a crock pot and cooked it on low for 5-6 hours. Turned out great - flavor wasn't bland at all and it was saucy instead of soupy. I'd make it again.",

For starters I used at least 10 oz's medium-width egg noodles 2 cups chicken and only 1 cup sour cream. Next time I'll try 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup cream of mushroom soup to cut down on the fat a little. Along with the onion I sauteed a small (1/2lb?) box of white mushrooms. I didn't have straight oregano so I substituted 1 tsp Italian herb mix along with white pepper red pepper flakes and seasoned salt to taste. Along with the simmering chicken mixture I added 1/2 cup canned corn and 1TBSP flour to thicken. Thanx to a great reviewer's tip to speed the recipe up a bit I did mix noodles chicken mixture and asparagus all together before adding to the casserole dish;I only added 1/2 lb or so of asparagus because I wasn't sure if my husband and I liked a whole 1lb.! I topped it all off with a Parmesan/Monterey Jack cheese combo and breadcrumbs. It barely fit in a 2 quart casserole dish but aluminum foil lightly folded around the top and edges helped! After cooking it for 30 minutes the asparagus was still quite crisp which some people love but I left it in for 5-10 more minutes...really tasty. Thank you!",
