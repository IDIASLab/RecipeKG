I wanted to stay away from other taco salad recipes, that use Catalina dressing. While I'm sure it's good, we are avoiding, what you might consider prepared foods. This taco salad recipe was outstanding. The seasoning mix added just the right amount of taste and heat to the ground beef. I tasted it before adding it to the browned ground beef, to make sure. The mixture of salsa and sour cream was also tasty. I will make this again in the future.",

One thing I love to do on taco salad night is add finely diced red peppers in with the meat. I cook half in at the start then the other half of red pepper near the end for a more crunchy pep. On the bed of romaine I toss in diced cucumber. While dairy isn't considered paleo I still consume it... I mean c'mon it's sour cream.... I can bathe in it!! And cheese... I'd be a cheesy crybaby without it!",

Instead of sour cream and salsa I used avocado yellow peppers tomatoes and feta cheese in a salad. I tried to make paleo tortillas but that turned out to be a mess from hell. My only dilemma with this recipe was I replaced the beef with chicken... do not replace the beef with chicken... It gave the meat a slightly grainy texture and the seasoning did not mix well making it a bit overwhelming. USE BEEF!",

This recipe is very much like the taco salad recipe I have always made and loved but I never thought of adding lime to the salsa/sour cream dressing. It was a nice touch. My seasonings are more complicated but this was just as good and I liked the cooked onion over raw. Thanks",
