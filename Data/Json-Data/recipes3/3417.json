Tonight I had a vegetarian guest at dinner so I made this recipe without bacon - I added 1 tbsp olive oil and 2 tsp liquid smoke to the boiling water instead. It turned out great and everyone was asking what gave it the great flavour. It seems like a lot of vinegar but most of the vinegar taste burns off leaving a nice fresh taste. Yum!",
