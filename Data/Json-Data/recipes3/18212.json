What s amazing is that it has 1/2 the calories as other sweet potato soups and still creamy and full of flavor.",

I increased thyme to 3/4 tsp.. I recommend lowering the garlic salt as it was borderline to salty for me. I did not find it necessary to add cream or half-n-half because it is creamy and delicious without it. My husband and son really like this  soup, and we plan to baked some crusty bread for dipping next time!",
