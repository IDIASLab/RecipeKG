I will only say that this recipe is VERY close to the recipe we used at work.  Some tips I learned from making it every day for six years:  -- Mix all the ingredients (with the potatoes straight from the freezer) the day before, cover and refrigerate.  Then bake it in a well greased pan right before serving.  Makes dinner prep a whole lot easier, and the mixture will be more likely to stick together than to the pan.  -- Don't \"smush\" it into the pan -- it'll turn out greasier and also stick to the pan.  Instead, use a big spoon or spatula to fling dollops of the mixture into the pan.  -- Colby cheese gives an extra Something over cheddar cheese.  Highly recommend subbing.",

I thawed the hash browns in a bowl in the microwave for about three minutes ( as mine were frozen when I wanted this and they seem to cook better as well), I used one whole stick of margerine melted, one whole container of sour cream( 16oz), omitted the onion ( overpowering) and the salt (soup and cheese both have enough). I mixed the soup, sour cream, shredded cheese, potatoes, margerine, pepper and a little bit of milk together until mixed. The milk makes it more creamy and less dry. I baked at 400 degrees in a very well greased pan ( grease grease grease the pan as this will stick bad--trust me on this) covered with foil for 30 minutes. I then melted a couple of tablespoons of margerine and mixed in a couple of handfuls of crushed corn flakes ( don't really need the  extra margerine but I like it so I use it :)) remove foil from pan and sprinkle on top. Bake 10 more minutes or until cornflakes are well browned. This was delicious with the changes I made and next time I think I will use a can of cheddar cheese soup ( or southwestern cheddar soup) instead of the cream of chicken the recipe calls for. Granted these aren't the healthiest changes but I would rather eat a small amount of good rich food than a lot of  so-so tasting stuff!",

This was even better the second time. I reheated what was left over in the oven at 350 uncovered. The top was nicely browned  and slightly crunchy, potatoes moist, and the flavor was oh so awesome. Love this recipe - Thank you for sharing !!!",

The only thing I did differently was cut the onion down to only 2T (I'm pregnant and am having a slight aversion to onions!). I also added one can of Campell's condensed cheddar cheese soup in addition to the cream of chicken soup because I love cheesy potatoes. My husband ate about 3/4 of the pan in one sitting!

We always prepare this for the next day..\n\nThis recipe is real close.\nThe people saying it's to greasy from the butter.. It's not the butter rookies... We use Colby shredded cheese ... When you add cheddar cheese and you cook it in the oven it melts mixing with the butter causing the oil from the cheddar and the butter to combine making it seem like the butter is making it greasy.....\n\nSo here the trick .... Mix your potatoes and the melted butter with... you ready.... Its not cream of chicken sweetheart.. We use cream of celery but with a twist.. Trade secret...\nMix all together put in oven at 475 for 12 minutes. take out and put back in container with lid and put in refrigerator for 18 hours... What happens is the potatoes starts absorbing the butter and the cream of _____  from 12 minutes at 475.... causing fast absorption and fast cool down in the refrigerator giving 18 hours of basically potatoes being marinade...\nPut back in oven at 450 for 30 minutes uncovered. Then after \n30 minutes take out and cover the top with a layer of colby cheese 500 for 10 minutes. Take out let cool until we start serving  Believe it or not that casserole when u order it is put in microwave for 40 sec before we server it..... That is exactly how we make it.....
