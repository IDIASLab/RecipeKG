I had never made or ate falafel before but judging from the responses I got from my son & his friends who eat them regularly I guess they turned out pretty good. I used greek yogurt instead of imitation sourcream (my son's not vegan) and also added in an egg to help hold them together better. I needed to double the recipe but only had one can of garbanzo beans so I used a can of great northern beans as a substitute for the 2nd can and that worked ok. I found I needed to added way more cornmeal than the recipe called for in order to form the batter into formable cakes. I'd definitely make them again for my son. He really liked them and I am always looking for a vegetartian dish to make for him and this worked well.",
