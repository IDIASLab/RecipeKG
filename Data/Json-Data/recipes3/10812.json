As written this is an easy and decent chili but not quite flavorful enough for my liking. Next time I make it I will use my own chili seasoning and double the amount. The garlic could double (or triple) as well. And I think if I sweat the allium before adding the beef it might pull out more of their flavor. I may also add a can of corn - I just really like a little corn in my chili. If you want heat you could add some canned chiles as well. There is no heat to speak of as written. Thanks for a good base to work from!",
