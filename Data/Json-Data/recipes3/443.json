The issue with the frosting is that you MUST drain the pineapple until most of the liquid is gone. AND keep the cool whip cold until you use it . Mix the pudding and pineapple together thoroughly first, and then fold in the whip topping.  I personally use the \"extra creamy\" cool whip when I do this recipe, it has a little more stiffness than regular.  HAPPY BAKING!",
