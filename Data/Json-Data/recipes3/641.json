It takes longer than 5-7 minutes to boil the cranberry/corn syrup mixture down to the right consistency which should be jam-like. It took me more like 10-15 minutes. If too much liquid is left in the mixture the fudge will be runny and if you boil it too much the cranberries will dry out and get crunchy and the fudge will be very hard. To set the fudge you should also let it sit for 12-24 hours in the fridge. If it's too tart for your tastes mix some condense milk in with your evaporated milk to sweeten it up. mmmm!",
