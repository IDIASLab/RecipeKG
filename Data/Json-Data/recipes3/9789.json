I would rather have cheddar.  I also changed the cooking method a bit.  First I seared it off in oil, then I placed it in a pan with the wine and covered it and let it cook for a few minutes, then finished it off in the oven til fully cooked.  It only took about 1/2 hour.  I think the recipe's cooking time is too long.  It was very tasty and tender.  I served it with Mushroom Orzo (recipe on this site)",
