I have never cooked before and I nailed this one. Only cons were I didn't know how long to preheat oven, and for the wings I left them whole instead of cutting them. However I like them better actually whole and I cooked them longer then said time by like 10 mins which made up for the preheating time. Cooked at 395 Degrees due to my oven, but it went very well and sauce came out delicious. Now I can do this on my own!!! Thanks!!!",

Many other recipes call for laying out wings on a baking sheet and putting them in the fridge to dry out. When you are trying to get dinner on the table for your hungry family an hour of prep time is a long time. Essentially after flipping the wings for the second half of baking time they are getting crispy in their own oil. The sauce was super easy to make. To tone down the spiciness I added a few squeezes of ketchup and I ommitted the flour. The ketchup added the necessary thickness. I too had a lot of extra sauce. I'll store it in the fridge until next week's Wing Night. Also I used fresh wings instead of frozen. Great recipe.",
