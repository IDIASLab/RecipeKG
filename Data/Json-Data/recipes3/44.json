I added an extra 1/2 Cup of beef broth with corn starch added in to make more gravy. I also used a double pie crust rather than the puff pastry....just personal preference. I only simmered the vegetables for 20 minutes...they were done by then and then I added my left over roast which didn't need to be cooked. I started it out on 375 degrees and cooked it for 20 minutes and then cut the heat down to 350 for about 20 minutes (didn't really keep track). It made a BEAUTIFUL pie (should have taken a picture!!). My husband ate seconds and said he really enjoyed it. I thought the wine gave it a good flavor. Will definitely use this recipe again.
