Sausage and lentils is a marriage made in heaven, and so good together, that not even kale can ruin it. I'm kidding, and actually love kale, but if you're not the biggest fan in the world, maybe try it one more time in this.",

I also like to add a good shake of red pepper flakes in with the sausage! I also use half a can of diced tomatoes if I\u2019m out of fresh. Sometimes I\u2019ll throw in a chopped potato if I need some extra carbs. MAKE THIS ASAP and share! :)",
