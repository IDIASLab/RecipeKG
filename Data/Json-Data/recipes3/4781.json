This recipe is very quick to make and an elegant starter to a meal for your guests. It is also a winner without the scallops and if you grow your own tomatoes, you can use the softer tomatoes and the flavor should be even better. Drizzle a little more avocado oil over the soup and you are ready to serve.",
