Delicious bread like consistency when put in mini loaf pans (no greasing needed in silicone pans). I dropped batter in the bottom of the pans and smoothed as best as possible. When baking normal by dropping onto sheets the browned crust that forms is crunchy and delicious with a moist bread like center. If you're not Whole30, butter and honey are killer additions.   Either way, be careful with calories. Each serving packs a punch and you won't want to eat just one if you are abstaining from added sugar or adding honey-butter. Guilt free calories for me though it's mostly from the almond's monounsaturated fats. They can be quite filling if you eat more than one or two.  Friends I shared with loved them and asked for the recipe. I will continue to make these often.",

Made as is written.  The only thing I will do differently next time is maybe add a bit of banana extract. I used 2 bananas, but maybe needed to wait till they were more ripe.  Delicious and so easy. I plan on making these with my 2 year old grandson, as his mama doesn't allow him to eat much sugar.  These would be a fun treat, cut in half, spread peanut butter on  them, and put a little banana slice between the two halves. Just enough for two little hands. But I cut in half and spread butter. Seriously, no difference from a regular wheat muffin, in terms of texture, except these were lighter and fluffier and moist.  They look dry and crumbly in the picture, but they aren't at all that way. I used a cookie dough scoop, so it made around 20.  Thanks so much for submitting the recipe!",
