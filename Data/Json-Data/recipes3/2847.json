Instead of fresh tomatoes (not in season now), I used a can of Rotelle - \"Milder\" and a 16 oz jar of mild salsa, then I left out the tomato juice, jalepeno and bell pepper (my bro-in-law is allergic). I might add more lime juice next time since it added such a good flavor but could have been a little stronger in my opinion - I LOVE citrus flavor. I loved the cucumber in this. I seeded it first and that might not have been necessary. But it cuts the spiciness wonderfully. LOTS of compliments and requests for this recipe. Storing this one in my recipe box! Thanks!\n\nOh, I also used 1/2 red onion diced finely instead of green onion.  A tad sweeter in my opinion.\n\nI made this again for 4th of July and made a couple changes.  I used a jar of salsa and one tomato.  Used the green onions this time since I had them and they were GREAT.  Also used 1/2 bunch of cilantro since that flavor is so good.  It's MUCH better the second day so make ahead.  I can't imagine anyone saying this is bland.  The salsa might be the key.  The best pasta salad I've ever made or eaten!",

From past experience I cut the amount of jalapeno which we believe to be a wise decision. I also used V8 juice (or a good Bloody Mary mix would work) and that gave it more of a taste. I used more juice than called for as experience has taught pasta absorbs liquid and with the amount given it was going to really soak in. Finally I added a touch more salt as that balances the lime a bit better and added fresh chopped basil flat leaf parsley and cilantro. This passed the 'husband review' with flying colours!",
