I followed the recipe exactly! I'm looking forward to eating it after it has sat in the fridge for a couple of days - if it lasts that long! UPDATED 3/20/11 - I make this regularly and I wanted to send out a warning to others who are not used to working with hot peppers. You really need to wear gloves or be extremely careful to not touch anything especially mucous membranes after handling these inferno peppers. The first time I made these I didn't use gloves and I touched my mouth (Not the smartest I know but you can learn from my mistake!). At first the burning was really intense on my mouth but the tingling lasted for HOURS on my hands. Anyway I get asked to make this salsa all the time and I'm always taking home an empty bowl. Recently my husband's office rated some store bought and some homemade salsa's and this one won! I love this salsa! Thanks Jeff!!",
