This recipe is not hard but a bit time consuming. I will use this recipe again for a \"sit-down\" dinner party.

For the pesto sauce...I have a basil plant so I made basil pesto using my regular pesto recipe. We made grilled asparagus to serve on the side. This will definitely be made again throughout the summer. My 4 year old even said \"This is amazing mommy!\"",
