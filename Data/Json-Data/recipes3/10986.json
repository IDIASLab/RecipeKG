The flavor was certainly enhanced by the earthy flavor of the peppers. This was delicious on it's own and on tacos fajitas and the usual dishes you would put guac on. It shined when we used it on hamburgers the next day and even ate them on our frittata. Definitely worth trying. Thanks for sharing this unique recipe.",
