                "reviewBody": "I am giving these 5 stars because I very much enjoyed the warm comforting flavor of them. When I made these I had no canola oil so I used regular vegetable oil instead. To bake them I initially set my convection oven to 400 and baked for the first 6 minutes as instructed. After 6 minutes I went to put the sugar on and the biscuits were already beginning to brown although I could tell by poking them that the middles were still raw. So I turned the oven down to 350 to finish off the baking and this worked nicely. I agree with the other reviewer who said it would be better for the sugar to be put on top before you bake them at all; as these are now the sugar falls off very easily. So next time I would put the sugar on before baking and then convection bake at 350 (I would recommend 375 for non-convection) for about 14 minutes or until golden. When I ate one of these (warm out of the oven none of that \"waiting for things to cool\" business!) I tried several different toppings: nutella peanut butter strawberry rhubarb jam and honey. My favorite was the jam but the others were great too with the peanut butter being my least favorite.",
