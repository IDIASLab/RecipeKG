I normally just grill it with EVOO, salt, and pepper (then I eat most of it and beg him to eat one slice).  Somehow adding bacon and bleu cheese changed EVERYTHING.  We've had this dish twice in one week.  It's super fast, easy, and I am literally picking the basil and tomatoes straight from the garden prior to preparation. EASY! Many reviewers have stated their use of feta instead of bleu cheese, but I think the bleu cheese ties the dish together with just enough tang to delight the palate.  I followed the recipe except for adding an extra piece of bacon and fresh versus dried basil.  Definitely a keep and repeat.  Does anyone have suggestions for making this a complete meal?  Maybe adding beans or another protein?  Thanks!",
