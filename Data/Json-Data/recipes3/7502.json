I topped it off with some toasted chopped almonds and coconut. Very very good. Thanks for the recipe.",

It gave it a nutty flavor without adding the extra calories and fat that nuts would. I put a mixture of splenda and sugar over it. It was really good! some white chocolate chips would really give it an edge with the cherries too - but I didn't have any. I really enjoyed this easy healthy breakfast. Thanks",
