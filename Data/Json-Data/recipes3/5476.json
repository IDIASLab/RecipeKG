We got one small jar of the marinated artichoke hearts and one can of plain ones (cheaper) then mixed them together...there was definitely enough marinade from the small jar to completely soak the regular ones as well as the entire dish! I can't imagine this dish without the artichoke flavoring- it made it! my picky bf loved it as much- if not more- than me. we used lots of pasta and it lasted several meals. YUM!",
