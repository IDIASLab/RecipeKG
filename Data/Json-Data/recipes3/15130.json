I just received my copy of America's Test Kitchen \"Air Fryer Perfection\" and they tested whether  or not you should preheat your air fryer. One of the virtues of air fryers is that they come up to heat very rapidly, within a minute or two. \nATK did not think preheating was necessary and neither do I. \nIt wastes time and electricity. Turning and rotating the food halfway through cooking, or shaking the basket, will insure that\nall sides are crispy.  Also, she was right about not overloading the basket.",
