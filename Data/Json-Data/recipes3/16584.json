I used the same amounts of sauce, but rinsed the jars with a couple oz of water which I mixed in. I also baked the tortellini for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees F covered, then added the cheese on top and baked about 10 more minutes uncovered. This is a very tasty dish. Hubby thought there was too much \"green stuff\", but I really liked the spinach. It's all in your taste. ",

There is too much sauce for the small package of tortellini.  We solved this problem by dipping garlic bread in the sauce.  I bet it would also be great if you substituted the tortellini with penne noodles.",

Our first time this was amazing! We used Prego Onion and Garlic sauce. The second time we used Ragu (can't remember what kind something similar) and it was pretty salty and tasteless. Having made the recipe before we knew how great it was and will make it again. But if we hadn't made it previously with such awesome results we never would have touched it again. That's what a big difference the sauce can make. I recommend going for something more tomato'y not sweet or cheesy. If you sample your sauce and it's too sweet try mixing a little tomato paste into it. Anyway great recipe IF you can pick the right kind of spaghetti sauce!",

Had Portabello mushroom sausages I had to use up so I threw it into the mix which provided extra flavor.
