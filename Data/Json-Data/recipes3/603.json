If they didn't like it, it would have been chicken A La Please-Mom-Never-Again!!!! Serve with a bechamel sauce.  For the weekend version, replace the vegetables with baby shrimp and long strips of green onion, brown, and wrap in puff pastry.",

I made a veggie dish and forgot to put aside the zucchini and carrots so did without in this one. I also used Dubliner Cheddar cheese and regular ham. I make chicken cordon bleu for my Dad often so he knows the difference between this ham and cheese and gruyere and prosciutto. He was very impressed with this dish but of course prefers the better ham and cheese. I don't eat meat but his review was that it was juicy and very flavorful. Overall this is a lovely presentation and fairly easy to prepare. I will definitely make this again veggies and all. When I do I will certainly update this review. Thanks Marie!",

Here are my mini-modifications: - Cut each chicken breast in half horizontally/length-wise so as to have two thin fillets and continued with recipe. This made two pieces per person; - I did chicken out (haha) and go with Swiss cheese as per peoples' comments and because Swiss was on sale (I had a strict budget) it blended very well. I will go with Gruyere when I make it at home; - used Proscuitto (yumm!) for the ham and may try the shrimp next time; - layered it on puffed pastry Vol-o-Vents and topped with a Bearnaise Sauce... Over-all an excellent and easy recipe for even the beginner. And the teens I teach loved it! So a positive 5-stars.",
