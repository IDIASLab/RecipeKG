Tomatoes and wine are acidic and will halt the cooking of legumes. Cook the beans for an hour or two; then let them rest in the refrigerator before turning them into the crockpot with the acids. Also because of the long cooking time don't chop the vegetables--chunk them. Make the pieces big enough to fit on a spoon. Dicing or chopping means they will disintegrate during long cooking time. Finally I wasn't happy with the consistency at finish. I wanted a thicker soup. So before adding the sausage I pureed about three cups of beans then returned the mixture to the soup for the hearty bean soup I was hoping for.",
