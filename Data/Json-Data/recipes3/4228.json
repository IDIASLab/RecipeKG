One important thing that made it  good is that I used whole shrimp with heads and cooked them without peeling them.  This way, the roe in the head adds a really nice flavor, 10 times better than peeled shrimp.  I also only used about 2tbsp of butter instead half a cup.  Make sure you use the ripest tomato you can find and use the wine that you will drink with dinner instead of cheap table wine.  In my househould we rarely make the same recipe twice, but my husband has already asked me to make this again soon.",

We used large frozen shrimp, organic spinach fettucine, and fresh tomatoes as well as the other ingredients as they were listed. Very quick to prepare. Reading the recipe I thought there might not be enough sauce, but there was plenty of nice (very rich) creamy cheese sauce. I was a little concerned about igniting the brandy since I have never done this before, but it was very safe and easy to do and I wouldn't want anyone to pass on this recipe because of this step. This dish tasted like something you would pay a lot for in a fine restaurant. Wonderful!! Thank you for the delicious and easy dish!",

Served over linguine but would imagine that it would taste great on it's own with sourdough bread to dip into the sauce.",
