One suggestion I do have and something I will do next time is to substitute thinly sliced red onion petals for the onion and garlic powder. Maybe even blend some fresh herbs in the ricotta. Regardless this is a good basic recipe and one that is easily adaptable to suit your taste.",

                "reviewBody": "First of all I would make this again. I would rate it probably 3.5 's to 4 's. A good basic beginning. This needed a bit more flavor. I used roasted garlic instead of minced raw garlic. I mashed it into the olive oil with the spices. I added about a 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning to the oil too. For the cheese I used a mix of mozzarella and an Italian cheese blend. I didn't feel the need to add more Parmesan cheese. I don't like burnt broccoli so I heated the broccoli florets in the microwave with a tiny bit of water (covered) for about 30 seconds. I used cherry tomatoes cut in half and finally added about 1/8-1/4 Cup of Bacon crumbles to the top. The bacon crumbles I used are soft not hard. If you use a brand that is cooked to a harder consistency add it a few minutes before the pizza is ready. My pizza did not require the full 20 minutes to cook. Be careful and check at around the 12 minute mark and remove when the crust is brown and the cheese is melted. This is a good basic recipe and I would encourage anyone to make it your own.:-)",
