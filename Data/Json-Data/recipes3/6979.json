However..the marinade is tasty and flavorful, the panko-parmesan breading is outstanding - but the chops should be cooked for less time at a higher temp  (ala shake & bake)  \n\nI think 15-20 min at 425 degrees would produce juicier more tender chops.  Plan to use this recipe again with these cooking times.",

This recipe is great for those who overcook pork or say that their chops are too dry.  I used bone in chops and they were very thick (1 1/2 in.)  I followed the cooking time exactly and these were perfect. If you are using thin boneless chops you will need to decrease the time. The marinade did not impart much flavor so many might find it bland.  Thanks submitter.",

The chops marinated for about an hour and while I thought the flavor was great I also thought the beer flavor was stronger than I expected. If you don't like the taste of beer don't marinate an hour like I did. The main reason I gave only 4 stars was because the coating never crisped never even browned actually a little soggy. Wasn't sure if it was the eggs or maybe pat dry after removing from marinade. Otherwise very good.",
