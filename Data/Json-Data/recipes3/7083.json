I'd never cooked venison before so was a little intimidated when my husband went deer hunting in his Volvo station wagon (Now called the Deer Slayer). THIS RECIPE ROCKS! The only change I made was to use fresh instead of dried rosemary. I marinated the meat maybe 5 hours. It was very quick to stir-fry and then I served it with \"Peppy's Pita bread\" and \"Duke\" sauce both from this site. Yum - what a meal. Wish I'd had some bozouki music going! Oh - this marinade & cooking method would probably work for just about any boneless meat you have handy. Do try it.",
