Instead of Russian dressing I used a raspberry vinegerette preferably one with splenda. I also use a entire jar of apricot preserves also the sugar free variety with Splenda. This helps lower the amount of sugar in the recipe and cuts out a lot of calories and fat that is in the Russian dressing. I think it tastes better too.",
