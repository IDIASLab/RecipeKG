I loved having the tiny pieces of apple plus the addition of extra cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg by me. Almond milk was used since it was was I had. The batter was made up the night before to help the morning go much easier. One could probably make up the batter with the egg yolks the previous evening and then whip the egg whites in the morning...but sounds like extra dirty dishes to me! NOTE: spelt is NOT wheat-free. It is an ancient type of wheat but with much less gluten than modern wheat.",
