                "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this oatmeal. It's delicious and easy to make. I found that I needed an extra 2 cups of water, however--as after 3 hours of cooking, the oats were super thick, but kinda crunchy. Also, you want to be sure to stir this every so often so it doesn't stick to the sides. I think I'll also just mix everything together in the crock pot next time, as the layering seemed unnecessary. As soon as I poured the liquid in, the apples floated to the top--so it's not like they stayed on the bottom anyway. I'll also use a touch less spice--as it almost had a bit of a \"bite\" to it with this amount. Probably 2 tsps of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg--keep the allspice and ginger amounts the same. I used 2 large Granny Smith apples, and that worked well--though I might try 1 tart, and 1 sweet apple next time for a better apple flavor. Thank you for the recipe!",
