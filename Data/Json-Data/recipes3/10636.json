I was looking for something a bit more than traditional and I found it, very tasty as well. I doubled the recipe and with that I added two tablespoons of olive oil mayonnaise ( only because I like it with it, recipe does NOT, need it, for I tried it with out the mayo also). I also added just a splash, splash only  of lemon juice to keep avocado from browning as it chilled. This recipe is a definite keeper. LOVE IT. Thank you for posting it. Tip keep the pit of the avocado with the finished salad and the keeps from browning too,,,",
