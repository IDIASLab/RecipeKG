I am not sure how that was supposed to work on a standard cookie sheet. Also with only one package of crescent rolls you were left with so much filling. What I ended up doing was using 3 packages of rolls and putting the filling in the middle and folding the pointy end over the middle and the two other ends up. This created little pockets with the filling. I also only baked them for 15 minutes at 400 degrees they were very browned at this point any longer they would bave burned. I will make these again but just not the way this recipe dictates. The filling however tasted wonderful but made so much.",

I did find the filling was more than one tube of Crescent rolls could hold WAY WAY more) so I used another tube of crescent dough and made two Roli's... I sauteed the onion bell pepper and garlic beforehand and used steamed frozen broccoli because I worried that with a mere 30 minute cook time the veggies would not be done. I read other's comments about the filling being bland so I added a packet of ranch dressing mix....and WOWEEE it made the Roli DELISHIOUS! I turned my oven down to 350 too because they were getting brown way too fast! Great recipe....looks soooo impressive and tastes heavenly!",
