This is definitely the recipe to try for rapini-beginners (it was my first attempt to cook with it) - you will be won over!\n\nNow I did tweak the recipe a bit by adding a large, diced onion into the mix with the garlic and let it caramelize a bit... the sugary, sticky onion bits are a fantastic complement to the slightly bitter rapini. I also added a healthy splash of cream towards the end (my rapini was starting to look a little dry) which made a nice 'sauce' that covered the pasta and brought the everything together. \n\nI know this is a vegetarian dish but next time I will also crumble some bacon bits on top...drooling already.... Thanks for sharing, niki!!!",
