I made only two small changes--instead of jalapeno peppers and roasted green chili peppers (because I do not have either) I used one 4 oz. can mild diced chilies. I just wisked it into the eggs before I added them to the skillet. I also sauteed a mess of fresh minced garlic in with the onion. The boys loved this. NOTE: What I did to make the eggs a little easier to handle inside the biscuits I basically cooked the eggs into a thick.......circle? Think omelette but not folded. Once it got firm I turned it and cooked the other side sprinkling the cheese over the top. This way I just had to slide it from the skillet cool it a bit then cut it into triangles with a pizza cutter. Wa-la egg that won't fall out of your biscuit!",
