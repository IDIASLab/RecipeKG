A famous Michigan Coney restaurant uses these proportions of condiments: 1 lb. hamburgh 80/20 fat ratio. small onion chopped 2 tsp. chilipowder(kind that has cumin in it already) 1 tsp. cumin 2 tsp. Hungarian sweet Paprika 1/4 tsp black pepper 1/2 tsp salt 1 tsp. white sugar. The mixture is prepared as Joanie suggests. In addition once the meat is browned one should \"pulse\" the meat in a food processor for about 2-3 seconds to break up the \"strands\" of meat. The white buns should be 7 in. in length and slightly steamed and the Koegel brand Vienna hotdog is just heated and then topped with the sauce and finally generously topped with chopped sweet onion bits.",
