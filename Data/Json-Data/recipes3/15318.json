Perfect chewiness though I did add more coconut than stated in the recipe. I added enough to make the mound more firm as it was fairly runny with stated amounts. I rolled my first half in more coconut but did not do so with the last batch. They really didn't look any different when cooked. I used most of a 14 oz bag. I am looking forward to trying this with unsweetened coconut next time. I only got 15 cookies with my cookie scoop and I flattened them before baking so as to have a more cookie-like appearance.",
