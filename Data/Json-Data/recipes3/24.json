Now when I am in the mood for a spicy burger I just take one out of the freezer and slap it down on the grill. In 20 minutes it is ready just the way I like it. And since I have grown my own Jalapeno peppers this year this recipe is even better. I first shared this with my buddies in July at our Annual Boys Night Out.
