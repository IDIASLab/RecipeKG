I used frozen green beans from my garden so I added 1 extra cup to start with to make up for the missing liquid. There was still nowhere near enough liquid. I ended up using several extra cups and a little extra tomato juice too. I thought the seasonings were spot-on not overpowering at all. My cabbage cooked away to nothing by the time the soup was done. This would be a five star recipe if not for the amount of liquid. I would absolutely say start with 4 cups of broth. One cup is definitely not enough. Leftovers are great the next day.",
