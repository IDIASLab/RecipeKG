These calzones come together in a snap, and are a great way to sneak a few veggies into your kid's diet.  The best part is they are small so it makes it easy for little hands to pick up and eat.

I think using refridgerated pizza dough cut to size would make these much better - as to me the cresent roll taste was what threw it off to me. I chose to saute the onions peppers and mushrooms before adding it to the rest. Will try again - only use the pizza dough in place. Thanks!",

I thought it was odd not sauteing the onions and mushrooms, and I also found it odd that no egg or tomato paste had been added as a binder.  I added one tsp of garlic.  You find yourself wanting to add more ingredients:  black olives for instance, some fresh basil.  But remember to use 2 tubes instead of one, because you'll have a lot of left-over filling.  It took 18 minutes to cook.  The flavor of the dough was bland.  It would be better if dusted with onion and garlic powder.  Powder, not salt.  These are salty enough.  It really needs the dipping sauce to add the tomatoey taste.  Excellent recipe but had to give it 4 stars for the \"woulda coulda shoulda's\"",
