I did try adding white wine in place of some of the broth as a reader suggested but it simply didn't help us like the flavor of the canned soup 'gravy'...next time I'll use 1 can of condensed soup and 2 cups of prepared chicken/turkey gravy to. I used 1 large can of chicken from Costco and a large can of turkey meat from Trader Joe's in place of the whole chicken called for. This recipe made so much that I've frozen one casserole (18 stuffed shells) prepped up to the point of baking it.::crossing fingers:: that it will thaw/bake up nicely when I pull it out for a future meal.",

These came out excellent and I was delighted with the (mushroom) gravy texture after cooking. Oh and I used boneless skinless chicken breast meat diced small. Thanks Jooney! Great idea. Finally! A great way to stuff shells without a ton of cheese (for a nice change).",

I followed the recipe with the exception of using cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken because I accidentally bought the wrong one when I went to the grocery store. Duh! We really liked it! I served the shells with steamed broccoli. Everyone went back for seconds. I used Stove Top whole wheat stuffing mix for chicken. It added a nice sage taste to the filling. I had a family pack of chicken thighs so that is what I used. I put them in the oven covered while I went to the grocery store and they were done when I returned. I chopped up the all meat after it cooled then I put the filling together. If I had been thinking I would have used the broth from the chicken pan for the gravy but I had already used the Swanson's that I bought before I thought of it. I added 1 t. garlic powder but no additional salt and pepper. The soups broth and stuffing mix all have PLENTY of salt. I will definitely make this again.",
