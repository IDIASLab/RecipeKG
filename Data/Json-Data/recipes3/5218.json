Evidently, my zucchini was smaller that those intended by the author, though, becuase I used an 11x7 baking dish, and it came out just right.  I also doubled the amount of both cheeses.  I found out mid-prep that I'd used up all my fresh parsley, so I threw in a little fresh cilantro, dried parsley and lemon zest.  I'll definitely do it again, but use the fresh parsley.  I also chose to reduce the amount of butter to 2T, and simply stirred in the softened butter, rather than fussing with melting it.  With the additional cheese, I found that it needed to go about 40-45 minutes in the oven.  We all agreed that the brown edges were the best part, and the middle wasn't soggy at all.  What a great way to use end-of-season zucchini bounty!",
