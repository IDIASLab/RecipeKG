I asked him to increase the garlic in the sauce to a few more minced cloves. There were no other changes made. The sauce was simple and meant to not overpower the meatballs which were obviously the star of this dish. My youngest boy was the only one who liked them. Everyone else thought they were oddly sweet and the grahams didn't pair well with the flavor of the parmesan. The graham flavor was really out of place with the homemade marinara. I appreciate the ease and playfulness of this dish and my son and I had fun making it together but it really wasn't a hit with all of us. I think the meatballs would have been better with a cream-based sauce (think swedish meatballs maybe) or even as BBQ meatballs?",
