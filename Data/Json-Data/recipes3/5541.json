It must have a taste of garlic and even better the garlic should be cooked well almost burnt.  You should cut the pieces of escarole small or it becomes a long stringy glob.  Also, you can make it into a soup by adding chicken stock and easier for those who don't like the thick gooey consistency.  This meal satisfies your hunger without a doubt.  Please use at least 4 cloves of garlic and sprinkle some granulated garlic as well.  You can add very small meatballs with the quart or so of chicken stock and it is like italian wedding soup",

I wouldn't have been able to fit any more escarole into my largest pan, it was towering!  Of course, like spinach, it melted down to next to nothing, but it was enough for a side dish for dinner for the three of us with a smidge left over.  I used extra garlic - probably chopped three or four cloves and I left out the parsley.  Just because I forgot it.  I also added a few gratings of romano cheese and stirred it in.  I will definitely make this again.",

My husband said \"well not EVERYTHING you make can be good.\" Hmmph. There were no instructions as to how to cut the escarole and so I left the leaves whole... big mistake! If you're going to make this I would suggest cutting the leaves up in slightly bigger than bite-sized pieces. I also felt the bean to escarole ratio was wrong.. too many beans! I used two large heads of escarole... maybe if I had chopped the leaves it would have seemed like there was more escarole because the escarole DID seem to lump up in the middle of the pan. DEFINITELY use more garlic. I used 3 cloves AND garlic powder and it could have used more. Also at the suggestion of relatives who love this meal I served it over penne pasta. Apparantly this is the rage in Italian restaurants on the East coast. I don't know living on the West coast myself (and since I LOVE Italian food I doubt that even if I did live on the East coast I would order beans over yummy cheesy saucy pasta at a restaurant!). All in all I won't be making this recipe again.",
