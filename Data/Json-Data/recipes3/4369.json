Melt the butter add the flour cook briefly (45 sec) add the milk and thicken. Add milk if too thick. Then add canned (or preferably frozen) peas. Heat. Then add the salmon keeping chunks. Heat on the lowest setting. Red salmon is better than Pink. Strangely fresh caught cooked salmon is not as good as canned!",

I also use 1-2 cans of East Point Canned Shrimp instead of salmon. The salmon is a bit too much for me. This recipe is classic new england and milk gravy is a bit bland but for me add a bit of salt pour over saltine crackers and this is fantastic comfort food!!!",
