This would have been 5 stars if not for the need for last-minute preparation. I doubled all the ingredients except the mayo, which I halved. Also added black pepper. I did assemble everything except for the crackers, then added those with each individual serving. I'd like to try this with sour cream instead of mayo, and serve as a spread for crackers of any kind.",

While it was definitely delicious as is and I'll make this again for sure, it needed a little something more.  Next time I'll add some chopped red onion and a few more shakes of black pepper.  I highly suggest using less mayo, you can always add more later if you need it.  As for potlucks, picnics, etc. it would be perfect - just bring the crackers separately in a baggie and add right before serving.  Taste and ease of prep = *5*!",
