Followed the recipe with the exception of using russet potatoes (what I had) instead of Yukon Gold, and they worked fine.  I had some concerns that the potatoes would brown too much on the bottom, so I had my heat all the way down to low.  I have used Henckels ceramic skillets for years, and this slid right out of the pan.  For my own personal taste, I may cut back just a little on the thyme, but this was very tasty and a company worthy dish.  Thanks Ann for an awesome new potato recipe!",

Long and behold the potatoes came out very tender and delicious within the time frame! I did follow the suggestion of cooking them at a low temperature. My actual touch was to put it 3 minutes under the broiler at 6 inches from it to brown the top a bit. Very good! Try to get the best Gruy\u00e8re you can find.",
