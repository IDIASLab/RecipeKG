This is a great alternative to using mayo in my chicken salad all of the time. The sour cream adds just the right amount of acidity along with the lime. This recipe did call for blending the chicken with the avocado but I did see the review mentioning that it came out pasty. I have made it with the chicken blended and while I do not mind it I really enjoy chunks of chicken in my salad so I opted this time to add it after I have blended all of the other ingredients. I served it along with some brioche sliders and voila! Perfect for a group of friends too. Will continue to make this again and again!",
