I only used one scant teaspoon of poultry seasoning and added one teaspoon garlic pepper.  I didn't have any sausage drippings - so I used more butter than listed.  If I had baked this as a side dish - I might have had to add more liquid (chicken broth).  But - since I baked it in the turkey (12 lb.)- no additional liquid was needed.  It came out perfectly!!!!!!!!  This is the recipe I will use from now on.  For variety - I might try using \"hot\" sausage next year - or maybe a different type of sliced bread (potato??).

                "reviewBody": "Yeah, this one is a definite keeper. The flavor is as good as any dressing I have ever had. I prepared mine in a slow cooker. Since I doubled the recipe, until the bread compacted, it barely fit into my large slow cooker. That's okay, as the stuffing cooks, it will shrink, giving you a little space at the top to stir the ingredients. As another reviewer suggested, I used turkey drippings to enhance the flavor and help the dressing maintain the right consistency (not dry out). I started the dressing on high, but lowered it to low, and then warm once we started eating. Cooking this in the slow cooker allows one to prepare the dressing far in advance. When on high, if you give it time between stirrings, the dressing forms a nice little crust where the bottom and side walls meet, which will be pleasing to any diners that enjoy a little crunch in the dressing. What a great recipe. This one rocks. An easy five stars!",

I remember my eyes burning grinding those darn onions but I wouldn't give up that job for anything!  LOL!   In mom's honor (she passed last month) we made this stuffing.  We did not saute anything, we added fresh parsley, I made my own bread for the cubes and we cut the butter back to 1/4 cup and used homemade broth (mom did) in its place.  I also used my home made sausage links and added some garlic per the Hubs request.  Thank you for bringing back those flavor filled memories.",
