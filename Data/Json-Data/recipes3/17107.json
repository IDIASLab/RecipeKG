After ordering pumpkin cornbread at a restaurant, I wanted to make a safe version for my 5-year-old, who has celiac disease. I got lucky on my first try, and the whole family devoured it! Serve hot with butter (or a spiced maple butter).",

This did not work at all for me.  It had so little cornmeal in the recipe, that you couldn't taste it and I would not think of it as cornbread.  It also was very \"gummy\" and crumbly.  It was difficult to cut a piece without it completely crumbling and falling apart.   The flavor was very sweet - almost like a pumpkin cake.  Unfortunately, I won't make this again.",
