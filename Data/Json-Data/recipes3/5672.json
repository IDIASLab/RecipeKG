Oh and I had no red pepper so omitted those. I used freshly juiced OJ from my Juiceman and I thought the flavor was very nice. Different but nice. I think maybe some white rice would have sopped up the sauce very well but I didn't have any. Never having had Colombian food I can't comment on that but overall this was pretty good and easy to make.",
