Instead of topping with additional cheese, I sprinkle with a bit of paprika for color. It is still plenty rich and indulgent tasting.  There is an error in that the ingredient list has both regular and green onions but the directions only mention the green onions.  I think one or the other would be fine or you can omit them altogether.",

I made a few minor adjustments, and I think it turned out really good. First, after boiling my potatoes I sauteed  them to get more flavor  and added dried basil, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder for more flavor...I also sauteed the onions before adding them. The one other change I made was using cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chickens as I was out of it. Everyone gave rave reviews!",
