I used dijon mustard instead of regular beacuse it's what I had on hand and added 3 minced garlic cloves and dill weed to the sauce. I also threw in 2 diced roma tomatoes for the last 2 minutes of cooking. I poured the sauce on top of the fish for presentation. It was surprisingly wonderful. Cooked cucumbers can be very strange but were completely fitting for this dish. I will be making this one again!",

I used FAT FREE (Yes they make it) half and half instead of heavy whipping cream; then I added 1/2 cup of fresh diced tomatoes 1/2 tsp black pepper 1/2 tsp dill weed and I substituted sweet and spicy mustard instead of the plain mustard. I served the poached fish aside seasoned couscous and topped it with the cucumbers in tarragon sauce; I then topped that with some diced roasted red peppers for appeal. Thank you Dickie for another way to use up my garden cucumbers.",

The only problem I've had with it is getting the texture of the cucum- bers right. That's a matter of practice. But the taste is wonderful and the preparation is simple. I would advise using a dry white wine as a sweet white cooks down and can make the fish too sweet (IMHO). I've tried this as written and tried it adding dill and garlic (per Bethy). I liked it both ways. Either way I like it better with dill tartar sauce rather than tartar sauce made with sweet relish. Thanks to Bethy for the suggestions and many many thanks to Dickie for the recipe. Fantastic.",

I used a dry white wine a Feteasca Alba. The type of white wine would make a big difference and this seemed to be a great choice. I The cucumber sauce was so good with just 4 simple ingredients. What a great change up for a fish recipe. I'll definitely be making it again and I think it's special enough to serve for guests too.",
