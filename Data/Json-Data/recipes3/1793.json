Throwing a handful of raisins in was a wonderful additional to the taste. Don't skip the Garam Marsala spice, which is a must! I found I needed to cook the mixture for an extra 15 minutes to get the chickpeas extra soft. Cook it long enough for this to occur, or the outcome won't be as good. I served this atop Basmati rice and made some homemade Naan. \n\nMy mom, who isn't a big Indian food fan, really liked this as well. We got three nights out of the meal between two people including the rice and bread. I'll definitely make this again!",
