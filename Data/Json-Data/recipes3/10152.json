Still once I mixed it up I was surprised at just how much I underestimated that. This was so mayonnaise-y it dominated almost rendering any other ingredient null. For the most part it s all I could taste. Once doctored with the additions of a fair amount of both sour cream and buttermilk it was markedly improved. As this recipe s first reviewer I wish I could have given it a better launching with a more favorable review.",

I discard the white part and about an inch of the green end then chop the rest very fine. It has to marinate for at least 2 days for the flavor to develop. Also most any type of crumbly cheese will work in this recipe.",
