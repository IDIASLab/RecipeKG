It was pretty, for sure, as well as fun and interesting to try.  But given that zucchini blossoms in most instances would be difficult to come by, don\u2019t hesitate to prepare this without them. If I hadn\u2019t prepared this myself and had been blindfolded, I wouldn\u2019t even have known they were in there.  Still, a delicious dish nonetheless.",

I made up the sauce while the pasta was cooking and the timing was right on for my bucatini.  This dish is as beautiful as it is delicious. The colours are bursting as is the flavour. I think a key factor here is to use a smooth pasta, not rigata it really makes a difference. Thank you robwala for sharing this lovely recipe.",
