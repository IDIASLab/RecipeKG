The sweetness of the honey was very subtle, which was good, and the panko gave it a good crunch without drying out the chops.  This is a great recipe that appears to look like it took a lot longer than it actually does.  Another plus with this recipe is that you will probably have most of, if not all of the ingredients in the pantry",

Maybe dip and dredge pork chop, not 'spread & sprinkle'?\" Taste was good, but the mayo layer was slippery, the honey drizzle competed with the rosemary, and the panko fell away Maybe if the chops were dipped in mayo and pressed in a shallow dish of panko the whole breaded effect would've held together better..",
