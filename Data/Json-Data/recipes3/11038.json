Made camels, sprinkled swirls, poinsettia flowers and decorated trees respectively.  Would make a super cute but simple cookie presentation.",

Now 40 years later the flavor is still not for me. They just aren't sweet enough. So I'm giving this recipe one star for flavor but five stars for workability of the dough. I bought a new cookie press and the two worked great together. However I'm gonna keep looking for other recipes.",
