I did not want to add too much more flour - afraid it would make it very dry. Instead of individual scones l baked this as a 6 inch round on the cookie sheet. I baked it for 15 -20 minutes at the suggested temperature. It is edible with a good flavor but not what I set out to make. I kept returning to the recipe to see if I missed something but I did not. I would suggest trying less cream -5TB in dough seems too much\"Maybe try a different recipe!",
