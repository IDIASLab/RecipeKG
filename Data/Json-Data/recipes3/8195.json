My own version of this has a leg of lamb and uses oregano lemon and feta cheese as well as the ingredients you listed. I was taught using the \"handful\" measuring method so I'm not sure about quantities. Still this takes about 1/10 the time and is very tasty:). Thank you for sharing! I'll be making this again for sure. Definitely try adding feta if you're looking for suggestions. It does wonders for this recipe.",
