Rather, I had bacon pieces, which I chopped, and fried up. I added the bacon pieces to the egg mixture along with the ham. \n\nI used a mixture of finely grated cheese; mild cheddar, and low-moisture mozzarella. And, instead of Gouda on top I used shredded Monterey Jack  cheese, because my son doesn't care for Gouda. \n\nI coated the muffin cups with butter before ladling in the mixture.",

I lined the cups with bacon pieces, as directed, then put a few punches of shredded mozzarella cheese in each cup and then topped that with the egg mixture. I did not too it with Gouda cheese, we didn\u2019t have any and I was certain that my kids wouldn\u2019t like it. Aside from that, made the recipe exactly as written. They needed slightly longer to bake, but only by a few minutes. They made a DISASTER out of my muffin pan, I couldn\u2019t get it clean, I had to throw it away. Next time I would try lining the tin with paper liners, or I would just make it as a casserole. Other than the expense of tossing my muffin pan, these were delicious, inexpensive, and fast!

In order to make 6 muffins I did need to use a jumbo muffin tin and cook time for me was about 22 mins in a convection oven at 325F. I made some heavy alterations to the recipe to make it more diet friendly. My version came out to 136 kcal/muffin. I made the following adjustments/substitutions: skim milk; reduced fat mozzarella; 15g total grated Parmesan in place of all gouda; one slice of bacon per muffin instead of 2; replaced ham with a saut\u00e9 of 1 medium zucchini, 1/2 large onion, 1 tsp olive oil and 1 clove garlic; omitted melted butter. Love how customizable this recipe is & will definitely be making it again soon!",

I used sausage instead of bacon and/or ham and I really wanted potatoes in it, so I added 1.5 cups shredded hash browns (thawed just enough so they wouldn\u2019t stick together in frozen clumps). I also needed to add two more eggs to fill all 12 muffin cups, but maybe I didn\u2019t put in enough sausage. Had to bake about 30-40 mins probably because of the partially frozen hash browns. If you make my modifications, you may want to spray the paper muffin liners because it was a little hard to get the egg out. Even with my modifications, turned out amazingly! Definitely a keeper!",
