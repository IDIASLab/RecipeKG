I skipped the breadcrumbs and egg and just used garlic powder instead of fresh - very easy to just sprinkle on and I don't like to mix up my meat much so I get a better burger texture. I think I'll try this with a stronger flavored cheese like a sharp cheddar or blue cheese. Thanks for the recipe!",
