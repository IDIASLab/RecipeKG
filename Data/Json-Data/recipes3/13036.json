Goes so good with the cinnamon roll crust. \n\nAlso I made it with crumbled maple breakfast sausage as well, very good but I prefer the taste and texture of crunchy bacon in the soft sweet dough. \n\nSometime in the future I am also thinking of doing this but using a soft boiled quail egg (or at least a small chicken egg) in the center of each roll instead of scrambled eggs ... sort of an odd twist on the idea of Scotch Eggs. \n\nExperiment and enjoy!",

My mistake was...I didn't buy \"Grands\"...I bought regular sized cinnamon biscuits, which didn't work.  They were not big enough, so I had to use two biscuits per \"bomb.\"   Also, I didn't know what to do with the icing from the biscuits?  The recipe didn't state, so I left it out completely.  Wondering if the icing would have added something to the finished product?  They were just a bit dry, so just maybe this would have helped.  All in all, this is a great idea for breakfast and I'm determined to get it right next time. :)",

I tried this mainly to see if it would be a decent breakfast when on the run. While I didn't try freezing any (the first batch disappeared fast) I'm sure they could be. Pop in a microwave and out the door. Before making this I wondered if more ingredients could be added. They could but consider extra space is very limited when bundling up the dough bomb based on the ingredients as written. I nearly pulled the rolls from the oven at about 19 minutes since they were a deep golden brown. Decided to leave them for the full 22 minutes. I found the dough bombs which were touching one another toward the center were a bit doughy when first removed from the oven. The extra 3 minutes and 15 minutes resting time made them just right. I'll definitely make these again and take on recreational outings. Very good recipe Julie!",
