Like another reviewer I also didn't add the chopped tomatoes to the pesto in the food processor and instead just spooned them on top of the pasta mixed with the pesto. Other recommendations- add fresh or dried oregano for extra flavour use rigatoni instead of linguini as it's easier to stir and eat and add a little extra water to make the pesto mixture more saucy.",

I definately reccomend adding much more garlic basil mint salt and pepper as this was quite bland as is! I fully expected \"knock your socks off flavour\" and it was far from that!",
