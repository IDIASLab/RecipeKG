There are few enough ingredients here that most people people will have these all on hand.  I didn't change a thing with the recipe and hubby loved it. No, he raved about it. This is now one of our favourites!\n\nJust a quick update -- This is the 4th time I've made this dish, but I found a time-saver that really works great. Instead of using dry lasagna noodles and having to boil them, I bought oven-ready noodles (which are fresh noodles) and this cut down on the time needed to cook everything. I just rolled the filling into the noodles and popped it all into the oven. Excellent! Turned out better, too!\n\n--- Another update (July 30 '10): Made this meal ahead of time and froze the lasagna rolls - it turned out excellent. I made the rolls as per my instructions above and froze them (without the sauce). When almost ready to use, I defrosted them in the fridge for a day and put them in a greased pan, poured the sauce over them and cooked for an hour at 350 degrees. Perfect. Will make these in batches and freeze for later use. Thanks again Philadelphia!!!",

It needed more seasonings -- garlic basil oregano -- something! I even used homemade spaghetti sauce and it was just okay. I let the spinach thaw out in the fridge during the day and it was still cool after it cooked. I would definitely thaw and bring to room temperature if I do it again. Also I only had about 2.5 oz of cream cheese so I added some ricotta instead because I like the texture. Maybe that's why it was so bland? Next time I would add more of the spices required for a lasagna to make it a more interesting dish.",
