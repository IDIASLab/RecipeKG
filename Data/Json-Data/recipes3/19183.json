The bacon is crispy this way and the chicken is very very moist.  Enjoy!!",

Although we all favor the pork version over the chicken - this is very good. As Zipporah stated eliminating the dried beef will still result in a good dish - and possibly even less salty (unless you rinse the beef off first). Thanks Lori!",
