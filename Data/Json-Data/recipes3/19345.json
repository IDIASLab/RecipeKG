After rolling the turkey breasts as described, I did NOT brown them in oil. This toughens the skin, particularly if the breasts are still cold.  I put them direcly into a dish with enough melted butter to cover the bottom to about 1/4\".  I then dipped 3 thin layers of cheescloth into butter and draped them over the turkey breasts, completely covering the breats.  I had 6 large breasts in a flat 3 quart casserole dish and they baked to perfection in 50 minutes. These were so tender; not a sign of dryness. ",

I was worried about the turkey getting to dry so I put a thin layer of butter on the flatten turkey breast, salt and peppered it and then layered stuffing, pecans and cranberries.  It doesn't mention to salt and pepper that maybe the reason why some reviews said that it didn't have much taste to the turkey.  The next day we made sandwiches with the turkey, added cranberry sauce, mayo, lettuce and it was great.",

Served with mashed potatoes and brown gravy and the rest of the stuffing! Very Good!",

By first browning the turkey, the skin turned out tough, and it was difficult to slice.  There was no basting liquid to keep it moist.  I took it out of the oven at 45 minutes, and it was totally overcooked.  I like the combination of flavors, so I'll try this again with modifications.  I will not brown it on the stove top, but will rub the turkey breast with some butter.   I will add some broth and a little white wine to the pan, cook it at a higher temperature initially to brown, cover it with foil, then lower the temperature, baste it often, and start checking for doneness at 25-30 minutes.  This is a good recipe, but IMO, the cooking instructions are not correct.  Served this for Thanksgiving, and although it didn't turn out as expected, the presentation is very nice, and it was not a total failure.",

I didn't have string so I used unflavored unwaxed dental floss. That worked fine. My turkey was definitely cooked all the way through but it never registered a temperature of 170. I think this is because it was hard to measure just the turkey and not the stuffing. I let it cook for ten extra minutes just to be sure but an hour would have been perfectly fine. Finally for decorating I didn't bother with the lettuce leaves. I used cranberries pecan halves and some fresh herbs and it was beautiful.",
