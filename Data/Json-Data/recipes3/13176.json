I skipped the string and just wrapped the bacon around tightly and put the seam at the bottom of the dish. I was worried the cheese would leak out but it was wrapped tight enough it didn t! I also halved the jalape\u00f1o and added fresh garlic to the sauce. Next time I will probably season the thighs before filling so they could be eaten without the sauce. Overall this is a winner I will definitely make again.",
