Now living California it can be difficult to get a fresh coconut not to mention the fact that I don't have the old school coconut grater my mom used thus making it a chore to grate a fresh coconut. Of course you must use a FRESH coconut to get that wonderful authentic flavor. I usually make this dish for my husband without the coconut store-bought whole roasted chicken(to save time) and with minced scallions OR chives. Sometimes I chop fresh baby spinach and add to the dish to give more color and nutrition. I absolutely LOVE kelaguen.. whether it's beef deer fish or EVEN SPAM. Yes I said spam. Man I miss home...",
