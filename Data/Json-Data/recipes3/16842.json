                "reviewBody": "AMAZING!!!! Is the quick review.  I have a gluten allergy so I am always seeking out gluten-free recipes.  I also love fruitcake...the only one in the family  who does...so this is mine all mine!  I have made this twice in the past month.  I spent a half a day going around town to find all the ingredients.  It is all a bit pricey but so worth it.  Here are a couple of changes that I made when making it.  I had a tough time finding cherry liqueur.  Finally found it, opened it and took a sip and I didn\u2019t like it at all.....so I used spiced rum to brush on the cake when it comes out of the oven.  I over cooked it the first time and it was a bit dry.  I got an oven thermometer to use for the second bake.  It turns out my oven was 5 degrees too hot so I turned down the temperature for the second bake.  When I went to bake the cake I didn\u2019t have an orange but I had a Meyer lemon on hand so I used the juice and zest from that instead.  I was afraid it would be too sour with the lemon so I added a couple tablespoons of orange liqueur.  The second time I made it, it was done in one hour except the top wasn\u2019t brown so I turned the broiler on high and browned the top (only took a couple of minutes).  It is perfect....and delicious.  Thanks to the chef who posted this recipe!",
