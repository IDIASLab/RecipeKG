I still think it needs a little black pepper, maybe some chili flakes - but I'm not going to harp on it. The whole time this was marinating I thought I may have finally gone too far left in the weird recipe category and would end up tossing 4 pounds of pork loin, but we were ALL very impressed with the finished product. Afer thawing and marinating in the pickle juice (I also used some pepperoncini juice - same diff - as I ran low on pickle juice) for about 20 hours, and cooking on the indoor grill for about 7 minutes total, this pork was super-tender, flavorful, delicious. And not nearly as pickle-in-yer-face as I thought it was going to be. I have a little leftover that I'm going to make cold pork sandwiches with on french rolls. Little mayo and black pepper (possibly a pickle or 2) and I will be in business. Thanks for the recipe!!",

                "reviewBody": "So I found this recipe earlier today and decided to give it a try.  It seems most of the pork chop recipes I found on this site and many others consisted of soy sauce and brown sugar. I was happy to find something different & low carb (with great reviews).  I was very pleased with this recipe.. but there was no WOW factor.  Dill pickle juice was a very unique marinade idea.  I did add a jalapeno, garlic and red pepper flakes to the pickle juice marinade.  And the porkchops did come out very tender and quite good...but it wasn't the be all end all. But I will make it again when I have used the last pickle in the house. For the newbie culinary folks this is a great recipe.   I would suggest roasting a pork roast in a cooking bag with the pickle juice.  Very impressive!  Just add some extra herbs and a little salt. And I agree with others  when they suggest not to tell your family or friends how you flavored the meat.  They will be pleasantly surprised to find out the flavor came from pickle juice.  But the pickle juice is only the base.  There is extreme room to enhance this recipe. ",

I found the claussen's to be milder and flavorful without over powering the pork chops. I grilled my chops and they came out juicy and tender. Will definitely make this again.",
