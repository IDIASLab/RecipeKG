After the first time, I made some changes and fine tuned it with much success.  I did the following: 1)I sauted the onions at medium heat, it takes too long on low heat and they don't soften enough. 2)I covered the chicken/onion mixture with only a drizzle of balsamic and stock, and prepare the sauce while it bakes(is quicker that way) 3)I simmered the sauce until it had reduced by half, then I added 2 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp dijon mustard to thicken.  Used a whisk to combine them, and then poured over chicken and baked 5 more minutes.  Also, it is great with pork chops as well, and the sauce marries nicely with baked asparagus too!

I made recipe as it said until you put it in the oven. I put the chicken in a oven dish, added HALF the stock and just a drizzle of the Balsamic, covered and put in oven. I put the remaining stock and 1/2 cup of Balsamic in a pan on stove. I boiled until it reduced by half. I then added 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of spicy mustard. You probably could use a dijon like someone else had suggested, its just what i had on hand. I mixed that to thicken it a bit, poured it over the chicken, and let it cook for the remaining 10 minutes. This is a \"make'er again\", for sure!! Thank you.",

Although I did change it up a little bit.  I used chicken breasts sliced into medallions, which I seasoned w/ S&P and coated in flour.  I caramelized the onions in one pan and sauteed the chicken in another.  Once the onions were done I added the liquids and brought it up to a simmer and added the cooked chicken.  Then I simmered everything for 20 - 30 minutes to allow the sauce to reduce.  I left out the tomatoes because I didn't have any and my children probably wouldn't eat them.  Next time I will add them for flavor and just remove the tomatoes from my children's servings.  A final thought, use REALLY GOOD vinegar for best results.  I would give it 5 stars but I felt I altered the recipe too much to do so.",
