I scraped out the remaining pulp from the lemon that I juiced and added it to the broth mixture. 3. I added 2 tablespoons of Lemon Pepper to the broth mixture 4.

I served over rice (Uncle Ben's chicken and wild rice) and spooned the excees \"sauce\" over all. Absolutley devine! The praise I received for making this dish made me blush.

Some changes when I make it- all optional obviously: 1. after I dip the chicken in flour and begin to saute it I then dip it back in the flour mixure-otherwise the \"breading\" is minimal and there is a lot of flour and herbs left over. 2. Never/rarely have fresh lemon (please!) so I just throw in lemon juice- prob 1/4 to 1/3 cup. 3. Never used the capers or lemon zest. 4. ALWAYS pound the chicken to within a centimeter of its life. Its so tender- amazing. 5. I use whatever in terms of the soup mushroom chicken chicken and garlic full fat reduced fat etc. Doesnt seem to make any difference to me. 6. I havent felt like leaving out spices if youre out is a big deal. Ive been out of parsley and basil and it made no difference- I just ignored them. 7. I always make extra sauce and a vat or rice b/c the family wants to eat it for leftovers for days. Im really surpised at those who dont like this. Ive made it probably 25 times and every time (except for one when I made a HUGE mistake on salt- tired due to having a newborn!) Ive been hailed a hero. Whoever came up with this recipe knows what they are doing. Enjoy!",

I have had my share of wonderful chicken recipes but this recipe definitely takes the cake; it is definitely on the top of my list! Fine dining / restaurant quality for sure! There is nothing to change about this most exceptional recipe other than the fact that I added lemon pepper to the chicken broth mixture as suggested in some of the reviews. I also added extra flour coating on the chicken breasts as it was cooking in the skillet to increase the 'thickness' of the coating and it turned out great. May I suggest the addition of chopped fresh mushrooms to the chicken broth mixture. But again it's only a suggestion since the recipe is perfectly fine as it is. Cudos to the creator of this stunning recipe! Safe to say I will definitely make this dish again but this time it will be for friends and family.",

I also only used 1/4 cup of butter 1/2c. seemed too much and I used the healty request cream of mushroom to cut back on calories. I had a lot of flour mixture left over as well.

I will add a little less thyme in the flour mixture and brown the chicken more using olive oil instead of butter. I'll then remove the chicken and keep it warm while i add the soup mixture to the pan without the chicken and then when its ready add the chicken again just to coat it. My chicken needed to be crispier before the sauce was added. All in all it was a decent recipe i just expected more after reading all the reviews. I'll try again!",
