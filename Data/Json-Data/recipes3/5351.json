After I made this sauce couple nights ago I was speachless how good it tastes. My husband could not stop adding more to his plate and that says it all. I cooked it for an hour and a half. I think it is a long time of cooking it that it gives all the ingredients time to blend together to a fantastic flavor. Thank you for the incredible recipe.
