Not a strong Baileys alcohol flavor. The ball was very soft and sticky. When dropping in chocolate the cookies tend to get soft fast and fall apart. I put hot chocolate in separate bowl which helped a lot It s a great tasting Cheesecake ball. I would use a few more cookies or less Liquid to firm up the ball a bit I used food processor",
