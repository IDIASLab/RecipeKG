The first time I used 1 1/4 cups of panko bread crumbs and that was perfect. This time I used the same amount but of fine bread crumbs-don't do it! Definitely stick with bread cubes or the coarser panko bread crumbs. They're awful with fine bread crumbs. I wonder if adding some cayenne or turmeric would be good for some added spice? I think garlic might be good as well. Thanks!",

They are great right after the gym. \nI used 1 tsp fresh thyme, 1 1/4 cups plain bread crumbs, 1 Tbsp pepper , 1/2 Tbsp salt,  1/2 tsp garlic powder, & 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Bake on oiled cookie sheet at 350F for 20 min, flip and bake 20 minutes more. To me the consistency was correct. The mixture was rather wet and stuck to my hands while making the patties. Also, they did not \"over-dry\" out when baked.\nWhen I make my own, I'll use 1 can beans, and some shredded (food processor) vegetable like zucchini, beets, mushrooms, onions. Add seasonings, 1 egg, and 1 cup or so of bread crumbs, then bake 350F, 20 minutes each side. \nIt's the seasonings that have been messin' me up. \nThis recipe is good like it is but it's also a good base for me to tweak and mess with. \nAlso try Carrot Burger by Phyllis Moody on this site.",
