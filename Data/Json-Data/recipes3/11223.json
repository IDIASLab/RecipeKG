It can be spiced up any way, but our spices we have found bring out the best flavor and they are the key to this recipe. Ground pork or ground lamb can be substituted for ground beef. It can also be cooked on the stovetop, which we do, or slow cooker. Eat as a stew or serve over rice, crushed chips or crackers, or cornbread.",
