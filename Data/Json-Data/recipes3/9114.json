Labeling things that just are that way as being that way is asinine. Traditional or Fresh Guacamole is what I would have titled it. Put paleo as a keyword if you want people looking for paleo/paleo friendly recipes to be able to find it. Go to a grocery store and see a sign for paleo vegetables and it is just the fresh produce department would be silly. Fresh vegetables already have a name and they just are paleo. I know vegetables can be processed or preserved and guacamole can be made with preserved or artificial ingredients to make them not be paleo but you get my point right?",
