The other reviewer was right and the panko didn't stick well to the peppers so I dredged them in flour before the egg. This helped significantly but I also decided not to replace the top half of the pepper because the panko stuck better to the cheesed top. I used a VERY potent raw milk roquefort so with half of the peppers I mixed the roquefort with some neufchatel cheese to tame it. The mixed batch were my favorites and my boyfriend enjoyed the stinkier variety. Overall very delicious and I like them better than \"poppers\" with cheddar. Thanks!",

My husband would like them better with a milder bleu cheese. Dipped all peppers into 1/2 cup wondra and then dipped all peppers into 2 eggs (clean gloves after) and then dipped all into 1 cup plain bread crumbs. I made a treat for my dog by forming a patty out of the leftover crumbs and eggs and cooked in microwave for 2 minutes. These work very well made ahead! Cook at 350F for 30 minutes and then remove from oven. When ready to serve sprinkle with a bit more 4 cheese combo and put under broiler as suggested by another reviewer.",

My spin is in rather than cut in half I cut off at the bottom stem part and hollowed out with a potatoe peeler and used a zip lock bag as a pastry bag to insert the cheese into the peppers. I got creative with the cheese blue cheese cream cheese and 4 cheese mixture. The 4 star rating is that the Panko did not stick to the pepper well. Next time I will use bread crumbs and try to scrape the outside of the pepper with a grater of some sort hopefully this will help the flour egg & bread crumbs to stick better. This was my first try and it was appreciated by all!",

                "reviewBody": "Speaking strictly about the baking temp/time and breading recipe here since I modified the construction and used a different filling: for non-fried poppers this works really well! It's true that the breading doesn't stick super-well to the poppers but I found that if I was very gentle with the unbaked poppers I was able to keep most of the breading attached. They're not fried and so you're not going to get a thick fried-popper coating. Next time I might add slightly less milk to see if that helps. I found the panko slightly stale-tasting but liked the nice crunch it added so might use a mix of panko and traditional bread crumbs next time. Finally the construction as written seemed a bit elaborate; I just cut the stem end off each pepper sliced down one side so I could de-seed filled with cheese and wrapped the pepper around the filling. (I used Boursin with chive and garlic which I had left over from something else.) Those modifications aside this recipe produced a nicely browned and crispy popper with the pepper itself cooked just right. Thanks for the recipe; our pepper plants are going nuts this year so we'll make these again!",
