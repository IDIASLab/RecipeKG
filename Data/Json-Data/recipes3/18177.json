The icing took a few hours to dry completely, but was indestructable after that.  Stored/froze well and tastes yummy; the lemon adds a nice flavor!",

If you're using it as gingerbread house glue don't put it on too thickly or else it takes very long to dry (just like real glue)! I'm thinking that it would be best to use this icing mostly as glue and then maybe a fluffier icing for decorative iced accents. As far as decorating gingerbread cookies though it worked quite nicely! You can dip them in it (like someone mentioned for biscotti) or decorate them with it or both. I posted a photo of my cookies and the initial stages of our very-sloppy gingerbread houses in my Cook's Photos.",

At first the icing was really runny, but it started to harden fairly quickly after I applied it to my gingerbread cookies (Eileen's Spicy Gingerbread cookies from this site).  Even using your standard ziplock sandwich bag to apply the icing it went on smoothly.  I was quite impressed with this recipe overall!\nI used rum extract (artificial) instead of lemon, but I think next time I may try the lemon or maybe almond or vanilla.  Two thumbs up!",
