Super easy to make and as a not if you let them chill over night instead of an hour they are phenomenal! I only got compliments on them! I cannot wait to try them with different liquers! I also added a wee bit more cocoa.... One other way to do it is 2 cups vanilla wafers and 1/2 cup of oreo crumbs. Again - easy and delicious",
