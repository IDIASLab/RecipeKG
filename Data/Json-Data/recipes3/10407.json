I added the cheese blend at the table as my husband is allergic to dairy. The filling was moist but did not hold together and I wonder if the egg should have been added raw to the meat mixture giving it more binding. Adding a hard boiled egg was a bit odd it tasted fine but didn't really add anything to the mix.",
