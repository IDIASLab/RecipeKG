                "reviewBody": "If you follow my tips regarding this recipe you cant fail. Ive made it 3 times and the best meat I found was cubed steak. Flour tip: Add any spices you like.. I added garlic powder and blackened spice. Important in the first dredge of flour press the meat into the flour hard on both sides to get it to stick and shake off excess then go to buttermilk and back to flour and be sure to recoat heavily in 2nd flour pass to cover all the wetness from the buttermilk. Let it rest for 5-10 minutes on wax paper Frying tip: I used an electric skillet make sure the oil ( I used wesson) is deep enough to basically submerge the meat. Approx 1.5 inches deept If you dont have enough oil your batter will fall off. I also used an cast iron skillet which works fine too but I like the electric skillet because of the temperature gauge and the ability to cook more pieces. Its really good if you spice up the flour mixture as much or as little as you like and use cubed steak because its more tender. Happy frying RECENT EDIT I have found that if use extra seasonings and you put your extra seasonings in the liquid (buttermilk) and add just salt and pepper to the dry(flour) u get a much better coloring on the batter. It keeps things like garlic powder or spicy seasonings from burning when they are in the liquid protected by the flour.",

                "reviewBody": "The three stars are because 2 cups of oil is WAY too much for 4 steaks. Otherwise the recipe is ok. I use tenderized sirloin salt and pepper the steak cutlets dip in beaten egg then in flour with more salt and pepper..have about 1/4 cup of VEGETABLE oil ready in large skillet and carefully place the steak in the hot oil watch carefully and turn down the heat (Med/low) so the oil doesn't get too hot and burn the flour coating. When LIGHT brown on one side turn over. If you need to add a little more oil do it by the Tablespoonsful as necessary. The secret to keeping the coating from falling off is to have oil hot when you put the steaks in it. Also Olive Oil will burn faster than veg. oil so I would not recommend it for this type of frying.",

Chicken-fried steak was one of my mother's specialties and this approximates her \"recipe.\" The gravy is absolutely awesome and is just like you might find at a good family restaurant! I did add a couple of teaspoons of chicken bouillon which made the gravy taste a little fuller. The buttermilk didn't seem to appreciably effect the flavor though it does make a thicker liquid mixture which probably helped the flour stick to the meat better. Mom taught me to use cast iron skillets for chicken-fried steak--the cast iron skillets and temperature of the grease--are the keys to getting the breading to adhere to the meat.",
