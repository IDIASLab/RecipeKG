This really is the best peanut butter cookie I've ever tasted yet. If u really like peanut butter u can actually add more. I used one cup of peanut butter (melted) and the flavor came out real good! And remember mix all the wet ingredients together before mixing in the cookie mix. This make the batter to be mixed more throughly and the taste would eventually comes out better. I also added one teaspoon of milk into the peanut butter before mixing in the cookie mix. I think that makes the peanut butter easier to mix well with the cookie mix.",

My suggestion would be to increase the amount of peanut butter to 1 cup (softened in microwave for 1 minute 45 seconds) and to increase the butter to 5/8 Cup. Mix together the beaten egg the vanilla the peanut butter and the butter separately from the basic cookie mix before blending everything together. Baking time in my oven was only 11 minutes for the optimal cookie. With these adjustments my ratings are 5 cards in all categories.",

I rolled them into 2(?) inch balls moved the oven rack one above the middle position and reduced the oven temp to 325F. Cooked for about 13-14 mins.
