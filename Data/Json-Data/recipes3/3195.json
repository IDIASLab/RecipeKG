I think that thing I love most about this dish is that my Dad always tells the history of this dish. It was invented in Portugal during the Spanish Inquisition. It proved that you were Christian because if you were a Jew you would not eat the pork (Or Clams) and if you were an Arab you would not eat the Clams. From there it turned into the must have dish for Christmas Eve in all Portuguese Households. Traditionally it is served with cube fries.",
