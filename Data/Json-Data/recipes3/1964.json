Also due to adding honey I reduced bake temp to 325 and baked for 20 minutes. They look great held their shape and were tasty! Will make again.",

I halved the recipe and used All-bran Original cereals (let it sit in the wet mixture for 10min to soften). I didn't have enough dried apricots (only 1/4 cup) so I used the rest in apricot jam and omitted the oil to balance the moisture. I also used 3 packs of instant oatmeal (2 of which were peach & cream) sifting away the sugar to keep the oats and peach bits (exactly 3/4 cups). I kept the cookies small as advised and it yielded 45 mini 1-inch wide cookies. The texture was pretty good and it tasted very much like granola bars. It was also not too sweet. They stuck on the wax paper and fell apart though even after spraying it with PAM... Overall it's a nice VERY healthy recipe but I can't judge it more than that since I made so many modifications...",

Some people recommended baking them in small drops as they do tend to fall apart. I kept that recommendation into consideration but instead filled a big spoon with the mixture and tightly packed it in before dropping it onto the cookie sheet. The cookies came out perfect size and shape without breakage! Thanks for the recipe!",
