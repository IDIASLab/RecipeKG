I like to make this recipe using 3 and one quarter cups confectioners sugar. The mixmaster really expedites the binding of the ingredients. Also I used the chocolate candy making disks at craft and grocery stores, formed the one inch balls on wax paper on a cookie sheet and put the cookie sheet into my freezer for 30 minutes . I use a long wooden skewer (shishkabob type) or a toothpick for dipping  the cold dough balls and they turned out very well. Very professional looking. With the disks they can also  easily be made with semi sweet or white chocolate.",

It was definitely great! (and I didn't have to add anything extra to get the crunch. :) And, thanks to previous reviewers, I creamed together the sugar & peanut butter before mixing in the room-temperature butter (not melted). After adding the butter and mixing around a couple times with my spoon, I put the spoon on the counter and mixed with my hands!! It creamed super fast and well! Then, I rolled the dough into balls and set on wax paper (I put the wax paper in a 16 X 20 pan) and put a toothpick in them before sticking them in the freezer for 15 minutes (which was plenty of time for them to harden). And I don't have a double boiler, so I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave and just made sure I stirred every 30 seconds for the first minute and 1/2, and then every 15 seconds for the next 45 seconds (because they can burn very easily in the microwave). I did have to put the chocolate back in the microwave about 4 times because it kept getting hard. \nI dipped half the balls in semi-sweet, and half of them in semi-sweet/butterscotch mix. I like the semi-sweet/butterscotch mix, and my husband likes the semi-sweet. So, we're satisfied! I hope these tips help some people, because I think mine turned out just fantastic!",

When the chocolate started to cool and harden I jsut remicrowaved it. Worked like a charm! Also a tip for the crumbling. REALLY refrigerate them before you dip and right before you dip give them a quick roll and squeeze in your hands. Out of the two batches I made I had one break on me!!! Great recipe-my work finshed all two batches in 15 minutes!!!!!",

This was the first time I have ever made Buckeyes so I think I made a mistake adding the melted butter directly to the powdered sugar because I had little bits of pure sugar and butter.

Since my first batch I have found that if you cream together the peanut butter and powdered sugar before adding the butter it makes it easier to get the butter to mix in.",
