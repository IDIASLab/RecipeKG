What didn't work for me was the 2 hours and 10 minutes of time invested just to end up with a so so dish. Also, my chicken was nice and tender after it simmered in the beer but after the total cook time of 1 hour 50 minutes, it was completely dried out. I think this recipe has potential but as written I cannot give it more than 3 stars. Sorry.",

Instead of the seasonings listed I used the taco seasoning(not the nasty packet kind), I also used Mexican rice and drained half the juice from the stewed Mexican style tomatoes, and I drained the chick peas, and asked them separately since they will absorb the watery flavor quickly. I used full chili and jalape\u00f1o pepper and added minced garlic and more chicken. Finally I topped off with the hot pepper blend shredded cheese instead of Mexican blend. A little warmer in spice level but a heck of a lot more flavor. Happy cooking!",
