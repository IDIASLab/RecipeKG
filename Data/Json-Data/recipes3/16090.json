I did this exactly as written, since I had 4 cleaned ears in the refrigerator in a Ziploc Storage Bag already.....and it worked perfectly! And no dishes or mess to clean up like I would imagine you would have if you Pyrexed it, or paper plated it, or any other idea..... I ate the corn, left the towels in the bag and dropped it straight into the trash. I dirtied one whole pair of tongs!\n\nFor the reviewers that are compelled to dink around publishing your own process and tooting your unicycle horn, here within a review of someone else's recipe or process submittal, please just write your own! I'd love to give it a fair review, also! I am willing to accept anyone's tutelage and ideas and be grateful when I see a good idea!\n\nBaking Nana, for this submittal you are top notch! This is how my mother would have done it if she were still here! Thank you, and God bless!",
