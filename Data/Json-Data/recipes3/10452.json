One day when I decided to make deviled eggs for the first time, I had made a beet salad that my mom taught me. This was just grated boiled beets mixed with mayonnaise and fresh garlic. I decided to use this instead of just plain mayo. And from here, my recipe was born! Hope you like it.",

These remind me of those, without the long term planning involved in pickling the eggs. I took a shortcut and used lightly pickled beets from the produce section and grated them. I was only using three egg halves, so I adjusted the recipe accordingly. I topped with slivers of beet and a dash of smoked paprika. Highly recommend these for next level deviled eggs, both in presentation and taste. Thanks for the recipe!",
