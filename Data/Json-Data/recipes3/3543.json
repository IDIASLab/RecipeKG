I don't add parsley (because of the green onion tops.) I substitute gorgonzola for the swiss cheese!!! Enjoy!",

I didn't have parsley so I didn't add it and it still came out very nice. I also took the advice from the other reviews and added 1 tbls bread crumbs and lots of garlic with the onion mixture. Next time I am going to experiment with adding parmesan cheese to the onion mixture. Thank you so much this one is a definite keeper.",
