Even my Chicken Pot Pie hating husband went back for seconds and reheated it for lunch. Which says to me he only thinks he hates it. Now I did make some changes to the recipe. I'm not a fan of frozen mixed veggies (lima beans eww) so I diced some carrots, onion, celery, fresh green beans, and a steamed diced potato. Added some frozen peas. Sauteed all these in a bit of butter until they began to soften. Then I made the sauce and added it to the veggies/chicken mix. I did add some extra poultry seasoning, parsley, onion powder, sage and a little thyme. Even with the cutting up of the veggies this went together quickly, love the rotisserie chicken. I didn't add any extra flour just let the sauce simmer with the veggies for a while until it started to thicken then filled the pie crusts. I did use deep dish pie crust.  I thought the sauce was a nice kick start to a pretty good Chicken Pot Pie.",

Knowing this issue in advance, I chose to add in some parboiled cubed potatoes -figuring the starch in the potato would help thicken up the sauce.  I noticed that aside from the mention of salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning that there were no other seasonings that came into play, mainly b/c the recipe focuses too much on the sauce for providing the base of the flavour. I don't care for poultry seasoning and left it out.  I elected to add in parsley, garlic powder, savory, and thyme. It's not bad for a busy working parent to make, but if you have the time you'll want to stick w/ a traditional recipe.",
