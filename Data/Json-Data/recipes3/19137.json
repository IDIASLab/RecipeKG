My dinner guests thought they were excellent too. The only thing I did differently(per other reviews) was to add the garlic powder(not salt) and dried parsley to the mix itself. I brushed the bisquits with plain melted butter as soon as they came out of the oven then quickly placed in the roll basket covered with a cloth. Also I just cooked these until done and had NO problems with the bottoms burning. They do indeed reheat just fine as long as you gently reheat them in a microwave on low and just until they are warm. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!",

What I do know is that with just a quick stir of a few ingredients I had a light fluffy tender and flavorful biscuit. I used an ice cream scoop to help shape them and make them uniform size. My only criticism is that I found the dough did not come together with the amount of milk called for. Hindsight tells me to use less. I added more baking mix until it was the proper consistency but it would have been better to have added less milk in the first place. But they turned out well in the end and I ll turn to this recipe again there are so many possibilities for variation!",
