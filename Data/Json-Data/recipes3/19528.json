I never have canned creamed corn so I used a modified recipe off this site using frozen corn and cream cheese with a touch of butter. I layered that with the oysters and just crumbled enough butter crackers to make each layer. I kept the amounts of cream and worcestershire the same. Baked at 375. It was really good and I'll make it again the way I did it. Thanks for sharing your recipe and even tho I made changes I think I stuck with the spirit of the recipe!",
