Just seemed kind of plain to me--no spices other than s&p--and some of the spaghetti noodles got crispy dry in the oven so you may want to cover for the first portion of the baking process. Since it was just tomato puree mixed in it almost seemed like I was tossing it with ketchup. I will post a photo shortly.",
