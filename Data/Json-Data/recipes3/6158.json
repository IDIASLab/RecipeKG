        "description": "Our lobster season starts May 1 in the Chaleur Bay region of New Brunswick, Canada. I know it seems a shame to put lobster meat in a casserole, but this is so delicious, and because we often buy 10-20 lbs of fresh lobster right from the fishermen, we often have some left over after we have our first feed. I often use it for a special luncheon with a salad or as an entree with a buffet dinner.  I am always asked for the recipe.",

Instead I substituted with only slightly less expensive crab.  Here's a hint: stay away from Philipps brand crab meat (product of Indonesia) - unless you like tiny pieces of shell in every bite.  Other than that this is a great seafood casserole.  Might try it using mixed seafoods (scallops, calamari, etc.).",
