I didn't have the Shao-Hsing or dry sherry and for only a few TBSP didn't want to buy it so I used a little soy sauce in it's place. It was delicious! Didn't change another thing with the base recipe but added my own veggies during the simmering phase.\nThanks for a great recipe I know I'll use over and over.",

I simmered on med low, uncovered for the 20 minutes. Served with steamed Jasmine rice (my favorite). My picky husband and 7 year old grandson LOVED it. I steamed sliced carrots with a little butter (we only use real butter) and those went over well also. Great meal! Next time I won't be using the salt since soy sauce is already salty enough. Bad for my high blood pressure. 1 serving of this recipie with 1 cup of Jasmine rice is about 320 calories, and is heart healthy too! For dessert I made a strawberry, kiwi, spinach smoothie with 1/2 tsp. of pure vanilla for my husband and I 165 calories. 30 calories for the serving of carrots. 515 deliciously healthy calories for the meal.",
