Very good and I highly reccommend to those of you who DO love crawfish and don't mind cream cheese. I will definitely make again once the price in seafood comes down! Thanks!",

I added a bay leaf (and took it out before serving) and some Louisiana Hot sauce as well as red pepper flakes to give it a more cajun zing. This dip is by far better when it's hot. When it is cold or room temperature it tastes faintly like a pate which I am not at all fond of. Warm that sucker up in the oven if you're not serving it immediately (or in the extremely unlikely event that there are leftovers!). Makes an EXCELLENT hot salad dressing on top of a simple bed of mixed greens or wedge with avocado cucumber tomato olives and capers. The texture is perfect when it is just finished being cooked and hasn't set quite yet to pour over a salad for a unique cajun touch!",
