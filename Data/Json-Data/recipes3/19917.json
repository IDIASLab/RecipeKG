Also I make pork tenderloin all the time and my husband has always LOVED it but he wasn't crazy about this one and neither was I.

Rather than a gravy per se I would prefer to call it a sauce for the meat (not suitable for other foods on the plate). A bit tart it was more palatable by adding ordinary catsup some veg. broth to the quantity I wanted. I thickened it with 1 tsp cornstarch/1 tbsp water - was great got raves. Will definitely serve again.",
