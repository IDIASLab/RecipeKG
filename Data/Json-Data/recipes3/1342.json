I wasn t sure I d like this one thinking it would be too sweet for both of us. But we re in Naples now and I thought the name was kind of catchy. While I was taking photos of the drinks Hubs was already into the leftovers and remarked Hey this isn t bad! We offered each other our traditional toasts took a good sip and declared it a sleeper hit. Too bad we didn t make more! Now we didn t have mango vodka so we used regular vodka and admittedly about half as much as directed. But the rest we followed just as the submitter intended. It is a wonderful blend of the ingredients that come together to form a taste all its own no one flavor is easily discernible. It s light refreshing not too sweet at all and really does have a tropical flavor. We enjoyed this very much! I love it when I'm the first reviewer of a recipe and I can rate it so highly and enthusiastically!",
