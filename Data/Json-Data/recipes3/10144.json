They were just salty enough but lacked any sort of flavor depth. Great recipe for inspiration. I'll try it again with a rotisserie chicken cornbread mix yellow rice saffron scallions red pepper flakes and curry. Maybe broccoli and cheddar baked in a stuffing mix too. Go easy on the filling as leftovers get a gross soggy bottom. It's safe to fill up to the top of the cups with the bisquick mix. It doesn't really expand like I expected it to.",
