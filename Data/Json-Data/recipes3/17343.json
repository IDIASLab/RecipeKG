When I saw that it had coconut and pecans, I pretty much figured I would be the ONLY one eating this (no one else likes the two), and that would be a problem.  So I started thinking what I could do instead.  I started with a chocolate crumb crust instead of graham.  I made the cream cheese filling as directed.  After pouring 1/2 in the pan, I sprinkled the filling with more chocolate crumbs, and drizzled with hot fudge instead of caramel.  Then put the rest of the filling in and topped with mini chocolate chips and more hot fudge drizzle.  I hope that this gives people some ideas of things they can also do.  I think that the filling is the main part of the recipe and people can use their imagination to layer whatever their family likes.  I made this in a 10 inch springform pan, and needless to say, I am not the only one eating this one.  It's outrageous and I will continue to make and come up with new flavor combinations!  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I use a frozen regular pie shell (comes in package of 2) defrost and pre-bake as directed. For the coconut butter and pecan mixture I cook mine on low heat for at least 15-20 minutes to get the coconut really crunchy (but not burned) which makes a HUGE difference in the texture of the pie. For the caramel sauce I use Smuckers but I slightly heat the jar in the microwave just enough to get it to drizzling consistency about 10-15 seconds on high. When ready to freeze I use waxed paper over pie and then wrap top only with foil. I always keep a spare one in my freezer for unexpected company or for when I don't feel like making a dessert (which isn't very often as I love to bake). Hope this helps!",

I don't layer it I just dump all of the filling in the crust & top with the coconut/pecans & caramel. And I don't use a graham cracker crust. It's a little harder but much better with a pecan/flour crust: Crust: Preheat oven to 350. Mix 1 1/2 C flour 1 C finely chopped pecans 1 stick melted butter together until combined & all moistened. Press evenly into 2 8 pie pans or 1 - 9x13 baking pan (sprayed with cooking spray). Bake @ 350 for about 10-15 min or until edges start to brown. Set aside to cool. MUST try it. You won't be sorry!
