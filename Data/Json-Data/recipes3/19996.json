I used thigh meat, and chopped into cubes oh and i used the red onions instead of yellow, and i doubled the peppers and added red and orange peppers also and about 5 min before i served it, i added 2 bunches of chopped green onions to the pot and served with chicken fried rice asian sides.

I'm very glad I did -- it turned out great. I used four chicken breasts, one bottle of Dave's Fire Pitt BBQ sauce, and a small can of crushed pineapple, as well as the garlic, peppers, and onions. I cut the cooking time down to six hours, which I think is the key to this recipe. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and I served it over rice. My boyfriend loved it as well -- he added some pepperjack cheese on top of his. I'll be making this again!",

The dark meat cooked an hour longer (4 hours on hi) than the breasts (a little more than 3 hours on hi). For the sauce, I used \r\nAbout 1 \u00bd bottles of Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce, 18 oz each\r\n2/3 of a 18 oz bottle of Sweet and Sour Sauce\r\nBottled Szechwan Sauce to taste, about 3 tablespoons (it\u2019s spicy).\r\nIn the cuisinart chopped \r\nAbout 7 cloves garlic w about 2 \u00bd large thumb size pieces of ginger and added to sauce.\r\nUsed more vegetables than suggested and added carrots to the mix.\r\n\u00bd of the vegetables went into the pot with the dark meat and the other \u00bd, minus the green peppers, went in with the light meat an hour later.  The last hour I added the green peppers and  about 3 or 4 tablespoons of sugar to taste.  About 15 minutes before serving,I added cornstarch mixed with the leftover pineapple juice.  It was SO GOOOOOD!  If you want to cook on low I would suggest not cooking breast meat more than 6 or 7 hours.  I have a Rival Crockpot.  THANKS TO ALL THE NOTES AND ADVICE that helped  so much!!  \r\n",

Instead of chicken, I used 2 lbs of beef sasuage, 2 16 oz packages of frozen pepper and onion mix. (Our Kroger grocery store carries this in the Kroger brand and it has red, yellow and green peppers with onions.)I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. One bottle of the regular and one bottle of the Honey Chipotle - adds a nice kick. I serve it over jasmine rice. I serve this dish 2-3 times a month (the family would like more often!) so its nice to be able to use the sausage as well as the chicken. Thank you for this dish!",
