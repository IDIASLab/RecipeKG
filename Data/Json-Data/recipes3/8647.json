We also enjoyed the sweetness of the apples in contrast with the tartness of the vinegar. The salami is a good addition; I used sliced Genoa salami strips as I had deli sliced Genoa salami in the fridge. Also I used red potatoes with the skin on. Thank you ibbz for sharing your recipe. I am not a big fan of making potato salad because it is a lot of work but I would make this again because it is delicious and certainly worth the time and effort.:)",

I made it vegetarian and a little healthier by subbing in fakin' bacon vegannaise cage free eggs...and for a healthy and delish twist apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. This has a great mix of favors I'm a big an of the apple/bacon and pickle flavors. Cheers!",
