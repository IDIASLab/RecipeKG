This recipe is the BEST that I have had in YEARS and YEARS. Talk about easy and cheap. I used fresh clams out of the Yaquina Bay that we dug. Since there is not a lot of juice I added about 1/4 cup of clam juice (sold in stores with tuna), half an onion, 2 small potatoes, 1t of ground cumin, and cooked for 9 hours. I used the heaven sent Wondra flour product to thicken to our liking! THANK YOU for such a GREAT recipe! Everyone should try it!",

Some white wine might add more depth or I should have heeded others advice about adding some potatoes or perhaps even some shredded carrots for color. Overall - a very good recipe but I think it needs some playing around with to make it \"perfect.\"",

To speed up the process I make the soup on the stovetop not in a slow cooker - it's ready in 30 minutes. To keep the clams tender I add them last just to heat them up. Fantastic recipe !!!",
