I've adapted the recipe by not stirring it while it bakes and adding the chicken before I put it in the oven to bake. It ends up being a very flavorful moist traditional southern dressing. It is a lot of work but well worth it. My only other advice is to not overbake your biscuits and cornbread. In this recipe dry breads = dry dressing. Follow the recipe and you'll have a winner every time!",

The only thing I do differently is usually using a rotisserie chicken in place of making my own.  Awesome!  I always make it for potlucks, especially around the holidays.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, Smatterchu and Eva! **EDIT**wanted to add after reading other reviews that you really have to add far more broth than you usually do for a stuffing or dressing.  I used 6 'grands type' biscuits, a pan of cornbread, a whole rotisserie chicken, 5 lg eggs, 1/2 T ea of sage & poultry seasoning, 1/2 t ea of seasoning salt and reg salt, plus an onion & a celery heart (chopped) & about 7 cups of chicken broth.  In the recipe it explicitly says the mixture should be THIN!  I had to mix this in a roasting pan, then poured some into a 9 x 13 cake pan and the rest into an 8 x 8 pan.  I baked it the large one for 45 min and the small one for about 35 min and it is really REALLY good!  Hope this is helpful for those who had problems with dryness.",

I especially love the little kick the crushed red pepper gives to the recipe.  I always use just cornbread, and sometimes substitute green onions for some of the regular onions.  You can also use just chicken breasts if you like as these are easier to deal with than a whole chicken.  Just use chicken broth instead of water when boiling the chicken breasts so you have the strength of broth.  From a true southern Texas girl, I truly recommend this recipe!!!! ",
