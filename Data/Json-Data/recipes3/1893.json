I used minced red onions instead of shallots (I had a feeling the stronger onion flavor might enhance this dish & I was right) & evaporated milk for heavy cream & I did add 3 cloves of minced garlic plus I used a homemade raspberry vinegar (from this site). I pulled mine off the heat after I added the milk for fear of it curdling like MollysMama's did. I had kept the chicken on warm in the microwave so I didn't need to reheat the chicken...I just mixed the pieces up in the sauce to coat them & then put them on a platter drizzling what little of the sauce there was (next time I am doubling the sauce) on top. I sauteed the breasts whole but after they rested for a few minutes I sliced them into 3 slices each before adding them back to the sauce mixture. I served this w/ Oven Roasted Red Potatoes (from this site)....wish there had been more sauce it was good on the potatoes & Bodacious Broccoli Salad (also from this site). This was a good recipe & I enjoyed the challenge of executing it well...thanks.",

I browned the chicken and then heated some spring onions and garlic (MUST have garlic!) in the remaining butter/oil - then added the stock & vinegar plus 1tsp cracked pepper 1 tsp salt & 1tsp rosemary and stirred in the cream. I then added the breasts back in and simmered for like 1/2 an hour until the breasts were infused with flavour and the sauce was reduced & thick. Divine! Very good meal with mashed potato & greens (peas or beans). TASTY! Thanks.\\ Oh yeah - my sauce was a lovely light brown in colour - no nasty red/pink so dont know what previous person was on about!",

I may try to cut the fat by using fat free half and half or evaporated milk next time but 1/3 cup of cream isn't too bad for 4 servings.",
