Of course I stole a few mushrooms before he left and thought they were great! The only change was he halved the mushrooms instead of slicing them to make better appetizers (the easier to stick a toothpick in my dear;-) and cooked them a minute or two longer to compensate for the larger size. Really great tasting.",

I had a pound of fresh baby bella mushrooms, sliced. 1/3 cup of olive oil is a lot of oil so I eyeballed mine, 2 T in a skillet. Once heated I added the sliced mushrooms, then a couple of sliced garlic, stirring everything. I grinded some fresh ground black pepper on top of the mushrooms. Did not add any salt. I added 2T of white wine and 1T of baslsamic vinegar. I also added a tiny pinch of white sugar to shave off that edge of \"tang\" from the vinegar. I am so glad that I did not add the full 3T of Balsamic called for in this recipe. The combination of seasonings blended well- a nice rich depth of flavors.  These mushrooms were delicious and complemented my steaks, \"Roasted Tomatoes with Garlic\", and \"Ciabatta Bread\", also from this website.",
