I added some saut\u00e9ed baby Bella mushrooms since I had some I needed to use and it was perfect! I could only find a 15oz container of ricotta but it didn\u2019t affect the flavor. I do think that with the extra 3oz of cheese and the mushrooms that it would definitely have been too much filling for a 9 inch tart pan. It filled my 9in pie plate up to the rim which also increased cooking time to about an hour. I will definitely make this again!",

                "reviewBody": "First, thanks to Paola for the effort. I really appreciate when someone goes out of their way to share especially with a video. However my Italian wife agrees that It could use some various herbs appropriate to an egg-spinach recipe. Also maybe some Feta cheese as mine result was somewhat bland. I used a box of 18 whole wheat phyllo that was in the freezer left over from making baklava and my tub of ricotta was larger so I ramped this up to use 1 1/2 lbs of spinach. The egg yolks were still a little runny at a 45 minute bake. Bottom line form me? Meh. I am not willing to adjust and try again as there are a gazillion other recipes for other things I am going to try first.",
