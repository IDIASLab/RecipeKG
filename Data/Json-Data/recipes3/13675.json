It actually added a nice and very subtle flavor that I appreciated. The chicken was super moist and did indeed fall off the bone making it easy to shred. However if I were to make this again I think I'd opt to use boneless skinless chicken pieces (probably thighs) instead of a whole chicken. Dealing with all the bones seemed unnecessary. I would think the chicken would be best served over something like rice mashed potatoes or perhaps even pasta. Thanks for sharing Kati!",

Also the recipe states two lemons zested so that's all I did. I found myself wishing I had put the juice in also as the lemon flavor was too subtle. All the lemon zest was mainly lost on the chicken skin which I discarded. I didn't taste the cinnamon stick which was fine. Overall I liked it.",
