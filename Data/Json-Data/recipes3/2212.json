However it is SO simple to raise it a star even two by using fresh shrimp added JUST late enough to cook properly (it just takes a few 3-4 minutes!) to cook. If you are worried about having enough shrimp flavor sack up some clean (no legs!) shrimp shells in small square of cheesecloth & add at the beginning of the heating process. Remove when they have improved the flavor & definitely (as you probably can guess before serving! (LOL! Ask me why I state this!!). I would add fresh chopped scallions on top for garnish.",
