I did reduce the flour to 2 TBS (the basic rule for a sauce is 1 unit of thickening agent to 1 unit of fat) and that worked perfectly. I did double the recipe b/c when I measured out the pasta it didn't seem like enough. I ended up with enough pasta but a lot of cheese sauce leftover (about 3/4 cup). To make one recipe's worth I'd probably use 1-1/4 cups of pasta. It makes a good base cheese sauce and would taste great with any mix of cheeses. Sorry Alton but I think you've been replaced!",

And I added a touch of onion powder. My kids loved it!! Easy, Fast and delicious! Also, after adding the noodles, let it sit for 5 minutes so the pasta can soak up some of the cheese sauce.
