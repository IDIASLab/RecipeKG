I sprinkled a pinch of parmesan cheese when I served it. This recipe was very similar in flavor to the Garden Fresh Tomato Soup from this site minus the roux. I highly recommend to use a hand blender if you have it. This will shorten the preparation time and yield a creamy soup. I will make this recipe again but will try it with roux and may pass it through a sieve for texture.",

I added another 30 minutes before adding the garlic. This gave my puree a silky texture instead of chunky. I used homemade chicken broth but since I like more of a pureed texture I only needed two cups 5 cups would've been too watery for me. I added 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil after returning the mixture to the pot and simmered for 10 minutes in additional to the fresh as a garnish. I also used Sante fe peppers instead of red bell peppers which upset my stomach. They have the same texture but a little heat. I will definitely make again with the changes.",
