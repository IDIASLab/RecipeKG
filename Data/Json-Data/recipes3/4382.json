Only thing I did different was to add to the water some chopped onions celery and a little poultry seasoning (I then save the broth to use when I've baked a chicken/turkey. I'lll add this flavored broth to the drippings and it boosts the flavor and helps make more homemade gravy!) Thanks for the recipe and here is to all who eat giblets - I thought my family was the only people left who did!!! They have lots of iron and are very healthy for you -- when not fried...(sigh)!:-)",
