I had just baked a pizza at 475 degrees and the oven was still warm, though turned off.  Well, I apparently forgot to hit start when I set the temperature at 425 for the biscuits cause when the timer went off and I checked them, they were barely risen and the oven was off!  (dumb, dumb, dumb).  I turned the oven off and left the biscuits in for about 6 more minutes, and when they were barely golden, I took them out.  Delicious!  So, I'm sure if a more attentive person made these, at the correct temperature, they would be not only delicious but also fluffy.",
