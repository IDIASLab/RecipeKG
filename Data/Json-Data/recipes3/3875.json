I doubled the rest of the ingredients. I used regular potatoes (diced) but didn't add them to the pot until the last hour. I used regular onion which I threw in the cooker with the meat. One of my mangos had gone bad so I used enough pineapple to make up the difference. I used creme fraiche at the end instead of the \"fromage.\" Oh and I used full fat everything.

We didn't have korma curry powder on the shelf so we made our own mix ((3 tbsp ketumbar seeds (coriander) 1 tsp jintan puteh seeds (cumin) 1 tsp white peppercorns 2 (2-cm) sticks cinnamon 2 cardamoms 2 cloves - all heated then ground together - and a 1/4 tsp of tumeric added at the end)). The second time around we didn't have fromage frais available so we tried a bit of cream cheese and that was equally good. Not bad at all and a great way to use up mango if you have it about!",
