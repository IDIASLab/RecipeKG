I also added almond milk instead of cream with an extra egg white. I didn't use any butter but sprayed the pan. Because the bread was looking dry I gave them an egg wash with one egg white and some almond milk. They turned out great! I took them to a potluck and they were a big hit and smelled delicious!",
