I only had half-n-half so I used that with 1 t. cornstarch added to it in place of the heavy cream. I also added garlic powder, a little Old Bay, and touch more hot sauce. Hubby had thirds and even picky 13-yr. old daughter left none on the plate. Served with a big salad. I will certainly make this again soon.",

I always just add 1/4 flour to any quiche recipe and *voila*...it makes a CRUSTLESS QUICHE!  Super simple and always fabulous! If I could have I would have substituted the crabmeat, but even without the real stuff my 5 year old son was requesting THIRDS! ***** I also sliced the imitation crab thinly so the whole texture of it didn't bother me as much***",

And I substituted real crabmeat as opposed to artificial. It was a HIT even with the kids! This recipe is definitely a keeper and next time I'll toss in some veggies to lessen my guilt about the cream. All in all a great recipe! The leftovers made a great dinner.",

I followed the recipe exactly (maybe a little extra tabasco) but found the cook time wasn't enough. I turned the oven on again with the quiche still in until it began to raise (about 20 min give or take). I took it out and let is settle a bit. Then we ate it. If I cook this again I will add about 10-15 min to the initial cook time then let it sit with the oven off for the full 30. Your oven and altitude may differ so keep that in mind.
