The stuffing was bland until I doctored it up and the fish really needed some personality. I dredged them in a combo of parm cheese and seasonings before laying them on the puff pastry. To the stuffing I added dijon mustard worst. sauce a bit of mayo lots of seasonings and just a small handful of fresh breadcrumbs. When I say creativity this is it. If you want to impress someone go for it because you certainly will. Don't be intimidated by making your pastry into a fish. It was so much fun and it looked absolutely ADORABLE! My family cracked up when I brought it to the table. End result was so darn delicious and I do thank you L. Chambers for your submission. Without it we wouldn't have had so much fun cutting up a fishy!!",

Only thing I added was some fresh lemon juice and parmesan cheese.  There was no sogginess whatsoever, the pastry was exceptional! and the fish(I used sole) was perfect!!  My husband despises fish, so I took the broccoli, cheese and rice filling from another recipe off the sole recipe from this site and even he said after the first bite that it was good! Unfortunately, then he tasted the sole a few bites later and stopped eating!! Oh well...more leftovers for me!!! Thanks for a terrific post! Will defintely make again and even use the filling in a stuffed chicken breast!",
