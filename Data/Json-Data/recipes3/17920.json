I used just 8 oz chicken broth and for the remaining liquid I reserved the juice from the lobster and added clam juice to make up the difference.  I then whisked in 3oz tomato paste and put it all in the soup.  I used 1/4 c white wine (instead of 1/2c) and 1/4c sherry.  It was ABSOLUTELY incredible!  *Works well with crab as well or a lobster/crab combo.*",

I use my hand blender to blend the vegetables & seafood, because I found that transferring to the countertop blender was too messy.  Also, I add clam juice instead of broth, as it gives it more of a seafood flavor, and I skip the wine. I also use just celery & onions and not the carrots & mushrooms.  I also use imitation crab & lobster meat sometimes, or throw in scallops and/or shrimp.  The base is excellent, and the cayenne pepper gives it just enough kick!\nI forgot to mention that I also add a small can of tomato paste and blend it with the vegetables and broth/clam juice.  It helps thicken the bisque a bit and also gives it more flavor and color.",

I decreased the butter by 1 tbp. to account for the lack of veggies. The wine sauce was a bit strong (I used a good chardonnay)...next time I will use just a bit less wine. All in all, very very good! UPDATE 7/24/06---Made this again using all the veggies & using leftover lobster tails (we purposely made extra for this recipe) & this time I simmered the lobster tails (I removed the meat) in the soup & then removed them before serving. WOW! It added such great flavor!!!! Also, this time I used a pinot grigio & even added a bit extra & the wine taste wasn't overpowering at all.",
