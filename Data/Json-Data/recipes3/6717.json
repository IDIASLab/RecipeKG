My kids loved it the first time I made it at home and it instantly became known as 'Tim Perry's Soup.' You might like a stronger curry flavour or a creamier soup, so adjust the seasonings to your taste.  It's ready within the hour, but the longer it simmers the better the flavor. Serve with crusty bread and butter.",

Then I added 2 bunches of broccoli and a large head of cauliflower washed and cut into small pieces, added pepper, crushed thyme and a sprinkle of cayenne(didn't have any curry). I let that cook for about 5-7 minutes, then added the chicken broth(low sodium) and added an extra cup of water with a chicken boullion packet. Let that cook until the veggies were tender and then I whipped it through my food processor making sure I left some chunks for texture. Added that back to the pot, mixed 1% milk with the flour, let that thicken, adjusted the seasonings, and added 1 pk of shredded cheddar and the kernels of 1 leftover corn on the cob shaved off. (It was like I cleaned out the fridge!) What a fabulous soup!!! Nice and thick and rich with so many veggies.....even my 1 year old loved it....will make again and keep in my rotation for the fall/winter!!",

Like everyone else, I made a few changes to it though.\n\nI initially sauteed the vegetables in oil to soften them. Once tender, I added my \"broth.\"\n\nI added a total of 8 cups of \"broth\" - well, water, and added two chicken and one vegetable bouillon cubes. That made  this soup go a lot further, and still retained the taste. \n\nI used two bunches of broccoli, and half a head of cauliflower. I also shredded in two carrots, and added 4 cloves of garlic, minced.\n\nI then used a hand blender in the pot to smooth out the soup. Next time I may leave some chunks to add a little more texture.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with this soup, and will definitely make it again.\n\n",

The first time I made it as is and the kids loved the cheesyness of it...but hubby and I felt it could have used some more flavor.  Since that first time I have been sauteing the onions with some garlic and diced up carrots and celery.  I add 2 tsp curry powder and a tsp of garam masala to the mixture and stir in together.  Then add the broth and broccoli and cauliflower.  I also like to blend my soup with the immersion blender...so easy!  Once blended, I find that the soup is thick enough and does not need flour to thicken it.  I have used milk, cream, and evaporated milk all with great success. For a nice change I like to use coconut milk...it is really yummy.  I also prefer to put the cheese on the table and let everyone serve their own amount to suit their own tastes.  Overall this recipe is good as is, but for our own personal tastes I would like to add more to it!  Thank you for sharing a recipe that can be tweaked to suit everyone's tastes!!",
