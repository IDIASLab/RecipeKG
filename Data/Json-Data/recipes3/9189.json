Also I reccomend Applewood smoked bacon in the mix and also as a garnish because although the mixed part may be soggy it serves 2 functions: the savory smoky flavor melds with the salad and adds a punch and the residual fat from the bacon stiffens up the liquidity. If you only garnish with bacon and omit the milk you miss a punch! For those who like dill or pickles they are a good substitution for vinegar and a flavor booster!",

I don't care for soggy bacon so I set that aside and then put it in just before serving. Thanks for a tasty recipe.",
