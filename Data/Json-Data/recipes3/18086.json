By all means, remove the chops from the pot after cooking is complete,  and thicken the juices for an an awesome gravy/sauce.  Apple juice and dry onion soup mix, what's not to like here, just knew it would be outstanding?  I used boneless chops that were about 3/4\" thick and threw in a few chunked gold yukon potatoes that cooked up beautifully.  The only deviation from the recipe was that I seared the chops right at the beginning using the Saut\u00e9 function for about 2 minutes per side just to get some color (for better eye appeal/presentation) and certainly would do that again.  Very nice, tasty, and very easy dinner.",

Though I did not substitute or leave anything out I bought bone-in traditional chops one would use for frying instead of boneless.
