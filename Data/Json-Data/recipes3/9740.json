Once I didn't have eggs so I substituted ground flaxseed in the proportion of one Tablespoon flaxseed plus 3 tablespoons water for one egg. It worked perfectly. I also omit the salt since there is already a whole tablespoon of baking soda in it. Sometimes I add chocolate chips or sprinkle them on top. My family doesn't like nuts so I don't add those. It makes a very light and fluffy banana bread so I bake it in an 8 x 8 greased pan and cut it into squares. Sometimes I use a quarter cup of sugar instead of Stevia. It is less sweet but still yummy and gives it plenty of sweetness.",
