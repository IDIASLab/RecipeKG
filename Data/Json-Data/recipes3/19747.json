First, a teaspoon of salt is unnecessary, I left it out entirely (Worcestershire is salty enough). I also left out the onion and just sprinkled in some onion powder. Also, fry ground beef in shortening? I don't think so. I used ground sirloin and cooked them in the oven. I greased a cookie sheet and baked the meatballs at 375 for 10-15 minutes, turning once. I then added the chili sauce, grape jelly and meatballs to my slow cooker and let them heat up.The combo of chili sauce and grape jelly is excellent, once the flavors combined and the sauce thickened this was an excellent snack. Great crowd pleaser.",

If you do this, you will need to start the crock pot on HIGH setting at least 1 1/2 hours before eating.  Ready to eat when liquid is simmering.  These go quickly!!!!

We made these for our Christmas party and everyone loved them - even me and I'm not a beef person at all! I used 2 lbs of frozen plain meatballs and found that the recipe uses exactly 1 small jar (I think 10 oz) of jelly and 1 jar (12 oz) of chili sauce. How could it get any easier? And definitely let them sit in the crock pot for a while - the longer they sit the more the sauce soaks in and adds to the flavor and texture. And don't forget that veggie meatballs work great with this too for a much healthier treat. Thanks for this fantastic recipe!!",

However, the sauce was way too sweet, not at all spicy, and left something to be desired. After some tweaking, I was able to make this an excellent appetizer that got great reviews! First, I baked the meatballs rather than frying them.  I mixed the original ingredients for the sauce, added a few dashes of Frank's Hot Sauce, one clove of minced garlic, powdered mustard, and 1 1/2Tbs Worcestier sauce. I poured the sauce mixture into the crock pot with the cooked meatballs and cooked on high for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. They were tasty and party perfect! I am excited to make them this way again!",

However, I don't use shortening and like another reviewer, I bake mine on a greased cookie sheet at 350 for about 30 minutes turning halfway. Also, instead of cooking the sauce on the stovetop, I use my slowcooker. Blend both sauces and then add the meatballs and cook on high for 2-3 hrs or low for 5 hrs. I've made this recipe many many times and there's NEVER any leftovers. Great for potlucks because you can bring your crock and keep them on the warm setting - just make sure not to overcook them - they burn easily if you overcook.",

I loved them myself. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I only had about 9 meatballs left in my pot when it was all said and done and the only reason for that is because there was so much other foods there. I put them in the crock pot but did so too late so to speed things up I put the sauce and the meatballs(frozen homestyle) into a pot on the stove and slow boiled them for about 30 minutes and then put them in the crock pot to take to the party. They were perfect great taste and great texture! Don't try the sauce when you first put them it because its gross but when everything cooks together its wonderful. Take my word for it TRY THIS RECIPE!!!",
