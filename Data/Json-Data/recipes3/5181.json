I did cook it more like a traditional stew, browning the meat, then adding the vegetables, stock and port and simmering for a couple of hours, because that worked best for me time-wise.  Believe it or not, I actually forgot to add the tomatoes at the end, but it was wonderful nonetheless.  The port flavour is quite subtle and pairs excellently with the earthiness of the mushrooms.  Fantastic served with soem fresh, crusty french bread to sop up the sauce.  I will definitely remember the tomatoes next time, and yes, there will be a next time.",
