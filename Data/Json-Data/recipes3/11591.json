I added the rice as soon as it was done. I added additional salt and pepper fresh chopped parsley and parmesan. I added additional lemon to each serving. This was fantastic!

So this review has minor changes and offers this verdict: Excellent! Exceeded my expectations! I like asparagus but too many recipes come out with it being good. This recipe comes out with it being great. I used jasmine rice chicken broth instead of vegetable broth doubled the amount of asparagus garlic and parmesan cheese and it turned out great. The only ingredient I changed was the broth and I made it more veggies intense. I will make this many times over. And my somewhat finicky wife loved it and said she would have some of the leftovers for breakfast (?). Like I said she loved it.",
