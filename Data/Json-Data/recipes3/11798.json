Maybe it just can\u2019t be scaled down, which I did because I didn\u2019t want to waste ingredients that have been difficult to get. Agree with another review as more liquid is needed to make the dough pliable. At one point I even added a tad more sour cream and milk. I felt like I got closer to making the dough in further attempts even to the point I thought it felt perfect and rolled out perfectly in my last attempt, but they just broke apart completely while cooking.  Sorry, this recipe just isn't working for me.",

I don't know what I did wrong but the dough was way to sticky but when I added more flour a tablespoon at time by the time it was as should be the dough was to dry. it rolled nicely and held together for boil but it puffed up to much and was more of a dumpling like texture. the only thing I know I did diff was I used dough hook beaters and not reg. I thought I use for all other doughs but maybe this caused the issue? I'm making for xmas brunch and I'm soooo nervous!",
