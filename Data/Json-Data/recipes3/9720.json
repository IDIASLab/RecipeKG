Still a little bland.\" We enjoyed that that using mustard and rolled oats made for a more unique meatloaf taste but it was overly moist and underly (is that a word?) flavorful. Making again would require a heavy addition of spices and I would consider pulsing the rolled oats in food processor (or using quick-cooking oats instead) as I think the larger chunks coupled w/ the 1/2 c. of milk are what made this a very fall-aparty meatloaf.",
