My friend who is a food critic and restaurant owner went on and on about delicious it was. I did add/change a few things. I added some bacon under the onions as well as on top, on the advice of another reviewer. I also added some more cheddar and asiago cheese on top under the crackers and shaved Parmesan cheese. Also the group I was taking the dish to are all big fans of garlic so I minced up a garlic clove and saut\u00e9ed for a minute in the butter before I added the flour. All the flavors blended perfectly! This will be my go to potluck dish from now on!",

I followed the recipe to a \"T\" other than 1/2ing it and making it in an 8\" square pan (I also forgot to add the parsley and used 2% milk...ok but I was CLOSE to recipe;) ). This is rich and delightful. While I won't make it often because it's so calorie laden it was delicious. I wasn't sure about the onions but they really made it (be sure to use sweet onions). I think this sauce would also make an excellent white sauce for mac and cheese! THANKS for the recipe!",
