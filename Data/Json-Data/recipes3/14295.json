I took a 1/2 cup of flour, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper and put it into a gallon sized zip lock bag. I then added the cut up stew meat and shook it until the meat was covered. As I removed the meat from the bag I made sure to shake off the extra flour.  I then browned the meat on the saut\u00e9 feature of the Instant Pot. This made the sauce thick and rich.

I used one of those trays of \"stew meat\" from the meat department, and it turned out so tender.  I couldn't believe it.  I peeled two potatoes and didn't peel the other two as an experiment.  The un-peeled ones turned out just fine.  I wouldn't bother peeling them next time.  I cooked for 35 mins, naturally depressurize for 10, then vented.  All veggies were perfect.  The liquid is more akin to soup than stew, so I made roux and stirred in the liquid which thickened it closer to a gravy, which is a step I would recommend to anyone making this recipe.",

I'm a little full writing this now:).\n\nI followed some of the other recommendations (cutting veggies up into bigger chunks, and used stew meat, etc.). Great advice, everyone!  And, as someone else mentioned, I tend to add somewhere between 1.5-2x the spices including garlic, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce.  Measuring is optional, right. \n\nFrom other suggestions, I also added extra veggies (whole mushrooms cut in half, thick-cut carrots, and potatoes).  My 8 quart InstantPot had about 2-3 inches of room from the top when everything was added.  \n\nI set the InstantPot on 'Stew' mode for 25 minutes and 10 minutes of it auto pressure release before I opened the vent.  My carrots were still moderately firm (because of the larger cuts), the potatoes were phenomenal and the venting had me drooling from the aromas.  And because I used stew meat, it was the perfect tenderness!\n\nI also made the broth a little thicker, but not to a gravy consistency as I prefer mine somewhere between soup and gravy.  The addition of 2 beef bouillon cubes added a nice flavor as well, but I didn't add them until I thickened it up a bit on saute mode.\n\nNot many changes to the core recipe (just more of the good stuff) and the flavor was phenomenal!",
