His favorite food is cheeseburgers, and since I couldn't make cheeseburgers for his family party, I turned his fave dish into a easy-to-make dip! It's a simple recipe that can be expanded on with a variety of ingredients. Serve dip with tortilla chips (scoop-style chips are easiest), potato chips, or thin slices of baguette bread.",
