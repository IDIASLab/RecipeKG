Instead of putting the arugula & basil in the pan I just threw it in a big bowl and added the hot pasta mixture on top along with the almonds and parmesan. The heat from the pasta wilted the arugula perfectly and left it with a slight bite. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this again.",

If you don't mind the saturated fat from butter changing out the olive oil for butter would improve the recipe tremendously. Thanks for sharing!",
