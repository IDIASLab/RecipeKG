My girlfriend and I managed to chop all the ingredients and cook this dish in about 15-20 minutes from start to finish. Based on some of the reviews that said the dish was a little bland, I added 2 tsp of crushed chili pepper and about 1 tsp of cayenne pepper to punch it up a bit. It added just a little spicy which is the way I prefer most of my food. I doubled the portions and ate this as a vegetarian main dish (along with some whole grain bread). Added to the Recipe Box and will make again!",

Swiss Chard has always been my favorite vegetable and is sweeter and more tender than other greens (also great for adding to soups). The stalks need extra cooking time, so I sliced and cooked them separately in boiling, salted water until tender. Not wanting to open a can of garbanzo beans for just a half cup, I used the full can. I left out the green onion, but added extra shallots and fresh minced garlic. Adding the lemon at the end was something I don't generally do, but enjoyed. For those looking for old-fashioned, traditional Italian cooking and need an Italian side dish to complete their meal, this is a great and authentic choice.",

Start the saute with the chopped shallots and 1/2 lb sliced mushrooms. S&P lightly with each addition. I had cannelleni beans on hand and used a 1 lb can drained and rinsed. Since it's mid winter I subbed one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes in puree. Sprinkle in some pasta or Italian seasoning and freeze dried basil. Add in the chard and chopped stems. Add a bit of veggie \"broth from the box\" if needed. Cover and cook a bit. Just let the chard shrink a bit and not get grey. Then nestle a few eggs into spoon hollows in the veggie stew. Cover and check every three minutes. Mine took about 9 minutes on very low to give perfectly set not runny eggs with creamy yolks.",
