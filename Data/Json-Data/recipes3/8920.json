I omitted the garlic powder, since I did not see the need when the recipe calls for freshly-minced garlic.  I felt there was something missing, so I did add a splash of balsamic vinegar which brought this to life.  The addition of the thyme and the savory is a little different from most bruschetta recipes I've tried, but I don't think I'd have missed them if they'd been omitted.  And that's not to say that we didn't enjoy this because we did!",
