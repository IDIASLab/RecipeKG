                "reviewBody": "This is, indeed, a fabulous weeknight meal, but the cooking directions are just plain wrong.   I've been cooking for 50 years, so I know that if you brown a one inch, boneless pork chop for five to seven minutes a side, it's DONE - further cooking will just dry it out and make it tough.\n\nInstead, skip flour on chops and SEAR them on both sides over high heat for a minute or two until they develop a brown coat, then remove to a plate.  Lower heat to medium (I remove pan to get it to cool faster), add butter and sautee mushrooms  until they give up their liquid (a half a finely chopped onion would deepen the flavor here) and brown.  Deglase pan with sherry, add soup and stir with whisk until smooth; place chops in baking pan, add juices on plate to sauce in skillet , stir, and pour over chops.  Bake in 375 degree oven until sauce is bubbly, about 15 minutes (don't cover with foil).  Alternately, you could just dump the chops back in the skillet and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nAs to the optional cheese, go for it; I used parmigiano reggiano to add some depth and bite.  Cream of mushroom soup is bland, and so is the cheese she recommends (the button I would need to spell motsarella and deglase properly is stuck).  If using Golden Mushroom, I'd use both! - or some sour cream to go for a Russian vibe.  Oh, and experiment with spices - sage and thyme go well.  Serve over garlic mashed potatoes or egg noodles.",

Kind of disappointing that not many people will actually make the recipe.  I read reviews to help get  better understanding of how the recipe worked and how people may tweak it based on their experience with actually making it.  As for me, I made it exactly as called for.  I really enjoyed this recipe and the optional cheese will be optioned out next time around, no need for it in my opinion.  The chops were perfect exactly as the cook intended and the sherry gave a nice mellow flavor to the sauce.  This is an easy weeknight recipe that delivers great flavor for the effort put into it.",
