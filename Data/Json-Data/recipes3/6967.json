We live close to the Amish in Ohio and know that there cooking is excellent so I tried this recipe.\n\nWe called them potato pancakes as that is what thy looked like.  They were AWESOME!  Everyone loved them.  I made them at home and kept them warm in the oven before we traveled.  Then, kept them warm in my relatives oven before serving.  The only difference is they lose their crispiness by being in the oven which is fine for some.  I like them crunchy right out of the pan!\n\nAlso, I was in a hurry and forgot to add the onions.  Nobody seemed to miss them!",

I used peanut oil to fry them in, instead of regular veg. oil. My husband really liked them, and I thought they were very good also, although they do tend to be on the greasy side. ",
