This is my husbands new favorite dinner - he loves how hearty they are and he loves bringing them to work for lunch since they're just as good re-heated. Here's a few tips to help it turn out just right. I made it just the same as the recipe, but the dough ended up needing eight tablespoons of sour cream instead of six - otherwise it was too crumbly and even if I got it rolled nicely, it would crack when I folded it over. Also, when you've sauted your filling ingredients, taste test them to be sure you've got enough spices. My spices were a bit old so I needed a bit more of each. Also, when stuffing your pies, I found that it works better to put a little less in each (I froze my extra filling for super-quick pies next time!) and that way they don't bubble out of their crusts during baking. Also it helps not to mound up the filling too much but to press it flat to keep the crust from cracking when you fold it over. I sealed mine well by using a fork to press around the edges. Maybe this all seems obvious to some of you, but for those new to meat pies, I hope it helps the process go more smoothly. The good news is, they all tasted great, misshapen or not! :)",

The only thing different I did was use regular potatos instead of red ones (didn't have any). I ended up with a extra potato in my filling but it still tasted great. Making four pies made each one end up a little larger than a Hot Pocket. Next time I might make eight instead and have them be a little smaller. Thank you very much for this recipe!",
