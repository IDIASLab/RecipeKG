Followed the recipe exactly until the amount of time for the last simmering.  After step #2, I put the sauce on low and went to the nail salon.  When I returned more than an hour later, I found the house smelling like Italian food heaven!  \n\nThis sauce is on the garlic spicy side, but Paul Newman would love it! It tastes like his Sockarooni sauce but oh so much better.\n\nI'm going to make it again soon with more of my tomato bounty, but this time it will be with a tad less garlic and spice and instead some mushrooms and fresh basil.  This recipe is fantastic.  Thanks!",
