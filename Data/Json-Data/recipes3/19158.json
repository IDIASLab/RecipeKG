I use 5 mini breadpans for mine and it bakes in about 45 minutes. If you lay a piece of parchment in the bottom of the pan and spray with non-stick spray, cleaning up the pan is a breeze.\n\nAddendum to my review (12/28/07)  The last few years, instead of using the candied fruits, I have used mixed dried fruits - apricots, dried cranberries, pineapple, apple, etc. and some candied cherries for color.  It isn't a lot less calories, but it is at least a little healthier and we like it a lot that way.  Just use scissors to snip the fruit into small pieces; dip the scissors in flour in periodically to keep the fruit from sticking.  ",

However the flavor is that of a fruitcake. The recipe also called for mincemeat pie filling. I had thought it had apples raisins and spices. Never knew it actually had beef! That is just very strange to me. To top with this recipe I missed the dense super moist texture of a classic fruitcake. That was what I actually desired. I had thought they were cooked by a water method or with some they sat so many days with a little liquor poured on them to make them moist. I had wondered how this would get the same texture or consistency without these processes. If looking for a fruitcake flavored sweet bread that is ready quickly and is dry enough to cut within an hour of baking this may be the recipe to choose. This was just really not for me and I hate that I wasted the ingredients as it will more likely get tossed.",
