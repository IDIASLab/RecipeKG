I threw in 1/4 cup of white wine after sauteeing the onion and rice, which is what most risotto recipes call for. I also tossed in some parsley with the parmesan, cheese and bacon. Wonderful.  As for those who don't like people giving high ratings to a recipe they've modified, well, I think that's the beauty of this site. You have the basic recipe, which is fine. But if you're like me and are a experienced home cook, you can look at the variations and see how it can be made better or to your own liking.   Sure, it'd be great to be able to make a recipe as written, then make it again with your own additions, but who the heck has time for that?",

I used cubed Pancetta instead of bacon and shallots instead of onions, doubled the Parmesan cheese, then added diced Roma tomatoes and frozen peas right before serving.  It was so good that my husband and I both went back for seconds and then ate the remainder for lunch the next day!  It took almost exactly 20 minutes to absorb all of the broth.  It took a lot of stirring, but it was so worth it.  Can't wait to make this again!",
