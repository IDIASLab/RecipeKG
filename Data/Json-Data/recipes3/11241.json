I ended up adding 1-2tbsp of brown sugar and that really livened things up. I also thought it was too heavy on the nutmeg. I'd suggest using half the amount of nutmeg but doubling the cinnamon because I could barely taste it. I also couldn't really taste the Cointreau so I suggest doubling the amount. This makes large portions which I liked. No wimpy tiny bowls of soup like some other recipes I've made.",
