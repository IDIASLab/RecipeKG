I thought calamari would be a real challenge, and I expected to have to make an alternative meat dish for myself and my 12-year-old son. WRONG! We all loved the dish. I didn't have cherry peppers so I just left them out since previous reviewers thought it too hot anyway...I used a little extra red pepper flakes and a little extra garlic and went liberal with the parmesan when serving. Delicious! We all really loved it. I also used gemelli instead of fettucine and it worked well. I will use it again and I will get the cherry peppers because I think it will only make it better. Thanks!",

That may have been a mistake because I found the recipe to be very bland. The sauce was indeed very thick pasty and not very tasty. I also thought the recipe should call for more squid. The sauce and pasta were so overwhelming I had forgotten that this was a calamari recipe. If I were to make it again I'd double the squid use 1 tbsp of starch for thickening and keep the spicy peppers.",

Used 1/8 tsp of chili flakes and this was nicely flavoured. I enjoy spicy food but I didn't find this to be very hot - it simply has a nice flavor with a bit of kick. For those that prefer it milder I'd suggest just using 1 pepper (you can even remove the seeds if you're really worried) but don't completely exclude them as they are integral to the original taste of this dish. I also used shrimp instead of calamari.",
