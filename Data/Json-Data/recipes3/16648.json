I've made this recipe as a dip 4 times and as a pasta dish 2x (cook a box of pasta like penne bowtie or medium shells al dente and mix the artichoke juice into the sauce mix then stir in cooked pasta and bake). For Thanksgiving I bought a nice casserole dish (w/ lid and metal holder) and made this dip and presented it to the host. Everyone loved the idea! I use sour cream as I don't buy GY (I'm learning to make my own) cut down on the pepper and use 1TBS of Sriracha instead of the red pepper flakes. The small amount of sriracha gives the dish a nice flavor but does not make it spicy my 2 year old eats it up.",

Also I only had sour cream on hand so I used that in place of the greek yogurt. As far as the crushed pepper flakes and black pepper I just used both of those to taste b/c I didn't want it to be too spicy for the kids. I baked this about 20-25 minutes until it was bubbly. Great flavor and a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I changed a few things: sour cream instead of yogurt pre-shredded 4 cheese mix instead of the cheeses listed and halved the amount of pepper flakes and half the amount of pepper since I knew some guests don't like spicy foods. I goofed and didn't realize how much this actually makes lol! I ended up with a full 9x13 pan of it. One thing is that after 8 minutes in the oven it wasn't even warm all the way through. After 20 minutes it was warm but wasn't hot like I wanted however it was OK and people were hungry so I took it out anyway. This will definitely need more time in the oven to get nice and hot.
