Being a Mexican family, we always add Mexican hot sauce (such as Valentina&reg; or Tapatio&reg;) and serve with saltine crackers on the side. The trick is to start with well-chilled shrimp, ketchup, and tomato juice cocktail so it can be ready after only chilling 1 hour in the fridge. Top with additional hot sauce and avocado slices if desired. Enjoy!",

It's very fresh tasting with all the chopped veggies in it. Be sure to dice all your ingredients...especially the jalapeno. It will make all the difference in the world. We served it with thin corn tortilla chips and saltine crackers. I personally preferred the saltines. They made the flavors really shine. I will absolutely will make this again.
