So on to the health food store for unsweetened coconut and macaroon perfection was soon achieved.",

One thing I recommend is use parchment paper or a silicone mat. I remember these were sticky and a little hard to take off the cookie sheet in years past. Another thing I recommend is once you scoop the \"dough\" on the mat is to damp your fingers and lightly tap down any of coconut flakes that may be sticking up to prevent burning. These cookies also need to sit awhile before enjoying being that if they don't have time to fully cool they will fall apart. But nonetheless great macaroon in my book. Oh side note: I used Fat free condensed milk this time and they came out great!",

I used 8 cups of unsweetened coconut 1 small can of sweetened condensed milk and two teaspoons of vanilla extract. I had to use my electric mixer to mix everything really well. Simply drop these onto a well greased pan and bake for 8 minutes. They are fragile when they first come out so be careful when you transfer them on a plate to cool. I love these simple treats!",
