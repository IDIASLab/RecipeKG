(Almost like a mild tzatziki sauce.) It was extremely good but also a bit runny so I'm glad that I went w/ Greek yogurt as well as using a third less than the amount of yogurt called for in the recipe. It couldn't have worked out better that the night I prepared this I was also making \"Baked Falafel\" from here and the 2 together were divine! (I also toasted the walnuts b4 stirring them in.) I think next time around I'll go lighter yet on the yogurt add a squirt of lemon and perhaps some minced garlic. (My husband smeared his Zucchini onto warm flat-bread b4 adding sliced olives crumbled Feta and the Falafel and I heard lots of \"mmmms\" a la \"What About Bob?\" in b/t bites.) My toddler on the other hand flung a handful of \"kookini\" across the table b/c she's going through an anti-green-food-phase. Keep the great recipes coming Asli!",
