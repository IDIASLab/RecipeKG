Grilling was no problem after brushing the grill with a generous layer of olive oil.  Forget the bun -- these burgers don't need it.  Instead top with a layer of steamed spinich and serve with Sweet potato french fries.  Visually stunning and absolutely delicious!!",

I ended up using ground turkey breast meat and added about 1/4 cup of chicken stock to the mixture of meat, feta and olives before I formed the patties.  They turned out to be juicy and wonderful, Definitely a keeper!",

Here are some tips for serving.  I used fresh spinach leaves, sliced onion and roasted red pepper as a base for the burger in the pita - and topped it all off with a spoon of cucumber sauce.  There are now brands of feta that have olives, sun-dried tomato, and basil already incorporated into the cheese - and this makes a wonderful alternative to plain feta.  Also, if turkey burgers are a bit dry, use half to 3/4 the amount of turkey and supplement with lean ground beef. This does help make it a bit more juicy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper! THANKS, LOl!",

I also mixed the feta cheese right in the ground turkey. Fried them in a skillet with a little olive oil. I then brushed extra virgin olive oil on whole wheat buns and lightly toasted them. Topped the burgers with baby spinach leaves and a splash of fresh lemon juice. Totally healthy and delicious. I served these with a healthy greek salad. FYI: greek seasoning contains: onion powder mint oregano garlic powder & sea salt. Gives the turkey burgers a little more flavor than all oregano. Try it!!",
