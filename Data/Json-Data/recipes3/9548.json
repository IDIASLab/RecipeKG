For great success the cauliflower must be cooked until very tender, must be dried out as much as possible, and a very limited amount of milk added, if any.  What I immediately noticed in this recipe was the addition of the potato flakes, and I thought that was ingenious!  The submitter adds just enough to ensure that the cauliflower is a mashed potato consistency and it was a very easy and effective solution!  You know, one of those, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d kind of things.  I made it easy on myself and just microwaved the cauliflower and dried it very thoroughly before I continued with the rest of its preparation.  Since I was serving this with gravy I didn\u2019t use the Cheddar cheese.   Obviously this only pretends to be mashed potatoes, but it does a fine job, particularly with the \u201csecret ingredient\u201d of potato flakes.   Suggestion:  For best flavor use butter, not margarine.",

After boiling the cauliflower for approximately 8 minutes I pureed it in my food processor then added the flakes milk and margarine; processed again then added the cheese. I did not take the extra time to bake the potatoes because my 2 year old niece wanted a taste and ended up eating two bowls. Four cups of cauliflower only made approximately three servings so I had to make a second batch immediately. Delicious! I didn't add salt or pepper due to the extra flavoring in the mashed potatoes. I will definitely make again!",
