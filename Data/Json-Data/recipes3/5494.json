I've had this many times before because it is somewhat of a traditional or everyday type of dish here in Trinidad. If you do have a gas stove roast the eggplant on it. The open flame imparts a smoky flavour which gives this dish it's signature flavour. I also roasted garlic to add in omitted the cayenne and used fresh chopped up scotch bonnet pepper for the heat in this dish. If you can't handle much heat don't omit the pepper at all - it really adds to this dish. I served with Buss-up-Shut (Paratha Roti) which is a different type of naan. Good base recipe for anyone wanting to try some Indian food. Thanks for posting!",
