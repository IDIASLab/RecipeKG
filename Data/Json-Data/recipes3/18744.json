The irresistible combination of sweet, salty, sticky, buttery, crispy, flaky, and tender is something you must experience to believe. Made with bread flour, the dough is a little different from croissants or puff pastry. Salt is also key here; the authentic ones are about as savory as they are sweet.",

I used the croissant method of locking in a slab of butter rather than grating, because it seemed easier to me. I made the dough and shaped the pastries the night before, then let them proof overnight in their muffin cups, topped with greased plastic wrap, in the fridge. I baked them the next morning, just letting them rest at room temp while the oven preheated, and it worked perfectly. For the big batch, I had to use every muffin tin I had in the house, which included a silicone pan and individual silicon muffin cups: they all baked fine. (Don\u2019t forget to put the trays on baking sheets to catch any butter drips.) I could eat these pastries every weekend. They taste best at room temperature, if you can wait that long. Oh, and be sure to bake them until they\u2019re a deep golden brown so that they\u2019re fully baked through in the centers and the sugar has a chance to caramelize.",

I thought the results were perfection, but my wife thought they were just a tad too salty, although she ate them with relish.  So, next time I will make them with unsalted butter to keep harmony in the marriage.  But really - these are FANTASTIC!  They weren't as hard to make as I had thought.  Using the cheese grater to grate the frozen butter is pure genius - way easier than beating cold butter and rolling it out.   I will henceforth make these whenever I really want to impress someone - they are beautiful and delicious.    PS - I baked at 350 convection - took 29 minutes.",

I also like to have tongs (to aid removal) and a sink full of hot water (to soak the caramelized pans) ready.  I also recommend having a bowl of cold water or some ice nearby just in case you get that sugar on you, might as well be napalm.  I cut/roll mine a little bigger and put them in jumbo muffin tins instead of regular cupcake pans.  Best sugar ratio I've tried is 2 2/3 C sugar to 1 Tbsp salt.\n\nTake them out of the pans IMMEDIATELY and dump them onto parchment or they will stick badly.  I use a convection oven at 350 F for 18 minutes and they come out perfect every time.\n\nHope this helps someone else!",
