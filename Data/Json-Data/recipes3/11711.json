I used 1 medium size lobster tail and about 7 (20-25 size) shrimp, that I had cut into smaller pieces. After cooking the shallot and garlic in the oil for about 30 seconds, I added the lobster and shrimp, and sauteed until the shrimp turned pink, then removed the shrimp and lobster to a bowl and added a bit more oil, added the onions right to that same pan and carmelized them a bit before adding the arborio rice to toast it lightly. I couldn't see dirtying another pan to carmelize the onions, and this is how I usually make my risotto (whichever kind I'm making), so I just went my normal route. For the broth, I used a combination of homemade fish stock that I had in the freezer with a bit of chicken stock towards the end (because I ran out of the fish stock). I did not add any salt, as my fish stock was salty enough. I also cut the paprika back to about 1 tsp, and the cream back to about 1/2 cup (again, using up a partial carton that I had open in the fridge). I added the shrimp & lobster back just before serving. It was SO GOOD! Would make again in a heartbeat!",

                "reviewBody": "Please do not waste your lobster.  The unusual amount of onion and the overpowering cayenne kills the flavor of the lobster.  The basic premise is fine, but I've never encountered a risotto that required cream before.  I don't think it really needs it, as the stirring during the cooking creates a lovely creamy texture anyway.  Next time I'd be more inclined to make a basic risotto and put the lobster on top, but these flavors aren't complementary.  The only changes I made were to add the lobster tail shells to the broth for additional flavor and I cut the onion to just half of one.  My family likes risottos and this is one that we just couldn't eat.",

I reduced the paprika to 1 teaspoon and cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the sherry I used more of the same wine. I omitted honey. Once the rice was cooked I added in the shrimp and veggies.
