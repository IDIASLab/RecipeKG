Not only is it much healthier than store-bought greasy pork sausage, it's delicious too! The seasonings are spot-on. I did use 93/7 lean turkey and the packages I bought (Jennie-O) were 1.25lbs each, so it made a little more than the recipe stated. I think if I used 1lb packages of turkey, I might lower the salt a tiny bit since the 2tsp stated was perfect for the 2.5lbs turkey I used. Also, DO NOT overcook these or they will be dry. Personally, I think 5mins per side is too much. Thank you cathy35 for the great recipe!",
