Also a 5 star for ease of preparation and ingredients one tends to have on hand.  I did have to add 2 more cloves of garlic but I am a garlic lover.  1 clove just did not seem to do it justice.  I followed exactly and used a 'Mier's Winecellar white table wine'.  I added the 1/2 cup and it was not overpowering.  I love to cook w/wines but don't drink it and although I could taste it, it wasn't overpowering.  It seemed to enhance the flavor and didn't hinder it.  It also is a sweeter sort of wine so thought it would help with that sauce tartness thing we all try to fix.  I did have to add 1 Tbsp. of BROWN sugar and that took care of it.  **I recently saw on Food Network that if you use BROWN sugar in any redsauce, it helps with that tartness fix better than white.** Thanks for the great recipe.  I'm going to let it sit in fridge overnight and make eggplant parm. tomorrow.",

I typically make 3x this much (as long as I'm going to all the work!) and then freeze it in family dinner-size portions.  I make the following changes (these amounts are for the regular-size recipe, without doing the 3x): add almost 1 tsp. dried basil; use only 1/4 cup white wine; add 1 T. sugar; use canned, diced tomatoes instead of stewed; use only 2 T. olive oil.  Although I made it once as just a marinara sauce (and it was excellent as such), I typically make this with meatballs; after forming the meatballs and browning them on all sides in a pan with about 1/2 inch of hot vegetable oil, I drain them and then throw them right into the sauce, where they finish cooking through while the sauce is simmering.  Definitely adds a lot of flavor to the sauce.  Yummy.",

If you cook this in a large sauce pan, skillet or fryer, you'll only need to cook it for 15 minutes, not 30. I added a little extra seasoning - as the other reviewers recommended. I also added 1/2 can of tomato sauce because I wanted more sauce for dipping garlic bread into and for the 1/2 pound of meatballs I made.\r\nRefridgerates/reheats very well. Will make again.",
