Everyone just loved the flavor this added to grilled chicken. I ended up leaving it to marinate for a few days as dinner plans got waylaid and had to be postponed. That may have had an impact on the level of flavor. I will be using this recipe again. Brilliant. Tasty and simple.",

Once I had it all mixed up I actually did not like the smell or taste of it that much at all. But I let pork chops marinade for about 30 minutes and put them on the grill with very little of the juice on the them. Then used a honey bbq sauce to grill with them and they turned out wonderful! I would use this recipe again doing the same thing but cutting all ingredients drastically since I wouldn't need as much to use as a cooking base.",
