The mix it in with the cheese and Bisquick, and bake until golden brown.  This is an easy, tasty appetizer that freezes well, so all you have to do is thaw them and pop them in the oven (or microwave, but oven is better) to warm them up.  I do suggest using hot sausage, or a mixture of hot and sweet, because mild sausage makes them a little bland.",

Its a Christmas Eve tradition in our house have probably been making it for 20 years. Highly recommend it:)",

I used 1 lb sage sausage, 1 lb hot sausage, 3 c. sharp cheddar, and 1-1/2 c. baking mix, and they were very good.  I used the dough hook on my stand mixer, sprayed my foil with non-stick spray, and drained them on a paper towel - all great suggestions.  I don't cook/eat greasy meat like this, but I was having a brunch and needed something to go with the Baked Omelet Squares (another fabulous allrecipe recipe).  I tried a sausage ball before the brunch and couldn't believe how good they were.  I'm giving this recipe 3 stars, but what came out of my oven (with the changes) was much better than that.",
