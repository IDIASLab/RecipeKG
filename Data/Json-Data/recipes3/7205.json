First I think they need more semolina the mixture was a little thin and my dumplings fell apart in the water and it wasn't even a strong boil. Next time I might try making the mixture and then letting it sit in the fridge to firm a bit. The taste was really good. I have been trying to re-create dumplings from a little deli in my hometown and these came closest to taste I just need to work on texture.",
