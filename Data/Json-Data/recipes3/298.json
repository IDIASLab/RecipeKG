Mochi is commonly used to make rice cakes, for which it is pounded in large tubs until it becomes extremely sticky. It is then formed into balls or squares, which can be found in Japanese markets. Mochi is also used in confections and rice dishes. It can be bought in most any Japanese grocery store. This is a delicious way to eat it!",

If the texture of the mochi is like 'hardened glue ' it probably has not been cooked all the way through. My favorite way to eat mochi is the basic way grilled on the stove with soy sauce on it. The mochi should be crisp on the outside and very soft on the inside.",

Also a toaster oven often works best for this dish because you need very direct intense heat to get the mochi to toast correctly. It should be quite obvious when it's done: it will puff up and the top should be a rich brown. Be careful of burning though because burnt soy sauce is particularly nasty. You may also wish to serve it alongside additional soy sauce for dipping. If you are new to mochi please be aware that it can be dangerous if not chewed properly and that frankly it isn't for everyone. I hope that helps.",

Anyway I'm half Japanese mom is full and we keep ours frozen. We pop them in the toaster oven and it does take a while... i like to wait til the inside pops out a little thats how i know its cooked through. I usually rest the nori on top of the toaster to get a bit warm and crunchy. Then on a flat plate i put some soy sauce and japanese spice (karashi) and cover the mochi. That way the nori will stick to the mochi and the soy sauce flavor is all there. After that i enjoy and dip with every bite!",
