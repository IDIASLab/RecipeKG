Anyhow, I used a 4 lb. brisket that I trimmed of most visible fat without sacrificing the integrity of the meat.  Also rinsed the meat well (couldn't bear to use that bloody junk that was packaged with it) before putting it into an 11 qt. stockpot with the spices that were packaged with it.  Added 1 can Miller Lite beer, water to cover, 3 large cloves of minced garlic, and about 12 whole black peppers.  About 1 hour before the beef was supposed to be done, I added the potatoes, carrots, and 2 small turnips, chopped.  Forty minutes later I added the green cabbage wedges and 1 large onion, cut into wedges.  Twenty minutes later all was done and it was DELICIOUS.  [P.S. I served this with a horseradish sauce--mix together 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup white prepared horseradish (or to taste), 1 Tbs. dried chives, and the juice from 1/2 lemon.  This is very good with the corned beef.]",

I sometimes wondered why my previous renditions sometimes came out on the salty side--this recipe is well-balanced in flavor. Now I know that a '10/5' potato/carrot combo really works...if you skimp on the veggies, the dish will be salty. Using 10/5 gives it a good seasoning balance.",

However, I thought I would try the crockpot method suggested by several reviewers.I also tried the new Reynolds crockpot liners. they work great! No clean up except the lid. I have a new Rival 5 quart slow cooker with removable stoneware crock. I had a 3.5 lb corned beef brisket(too fatty)and followed the Rival instructions which called for 1 cup of water, onions and cabbage only. I added 6 small potatoes and 3 carrots, cut in half. In 8 hours everything was overcooked, including the veggies! I could see the broth boiling around the inside of the crockpot, so I assume it gets too high when set on low.  It's best omit all liquid as it is not needed when cooking roasts in the crockpot. Cooking the corned beef in the old fashioned way is the best. Skip the crockpot!",

Try covering the corn beef with four cans of beef broth and include the spice packet after cutting the big fat off. Bring to a boil and turn to low to simmer 2-21/2 hrs. Then add potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, mushrooms and cabbage for the last hour. Make sure the meat is cooked first by poking the meat before adding vegetables and use a large pot on top of the stove!  I didn't mean to rewrite the recipe, but this is much more tasty way the prepare the corn beef!!!!  Don't forget the french bread says my husband and he is right!!!",

I started out by cooking this on the stove top as the recipe states (for about 45 minutes) but due to a family emergency, I had to leave the house.  Before leaving, I put the meat and liquid into my crock pot.  By the time I got home, the meat was perfectly cooked (45 minutes on stove, then 7 hours in crock pot for an almost 3 lb. roast).  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added 1/2 stick of butter to the liquid as the meat cooked and I also used beef broth instead of water.  The next day on the stovetop I cooked the cabbage, carrots and potatoes in the liquid the meat cooked in the night before.  When the vegetalbes were done, I added the meat back into the liquid just to warm it.  It was SOOOOOO good!!  I will definitely make this again!!",
