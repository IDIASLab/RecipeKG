Instead of using 2 lbs of ground beef, I used only one and then used a lb of italian sausage.  Very good.  I would recommend to any one esspecially if they are serving a large crowd (family reunions, graduation parties and so on) it feeds alot and everyone is sure to partake and enjoy!",

I used red pepper instead of green 10 oz. sliced fresh button mushrooms instead of canned and when I was near done sauteing the above ingredients I made a well in the middle of the pan and cooked three raw chicken tenders thawed from my freezer. I used 1.25 lbs ground beef 25 low-fat turkey pepperoni slices (layered in groups of five and sliced in quarters) instead of ham I used 4 oz. chopped kielbasa (did not cut amount in half). I threw all the sauce ingredients together and simmered while preparing 8 oz. Whole Wheat Rotini pasta. For the layers I used some open red sauce from my fridge to coat the bottom of the pan then pasta sauce cheese (used about 10 oz mozzarella and used the whole 2 tbl of parm). A perfect dish to leave for your family to reheat when your away!!",

Though it takes some time there isn't anything particularly difficult about it. As others have done I cut the recipe in half and still had a heaping mound of food. It came out of the oven piping hot with a golden brown topping. I received rave reviews from my family. We didn't even need a side dish... just a little Italian bread and butter. For kids and adults alike for a hearty unbelievably tasty meal - check this one out!!!",
