Woo-hoo! Also I made the chicken three different ways. Some straight by the recipe. Some pieces I soaked in hot sauce then grilled on my george foreman. And a few I brushed with some hot&spicy BBQ sauce and grilled. All were good but the ones that soaked in hot sauce then grilled were the clear favorite. I'll make this again and again. Thanks!",
