The first time I made it I used a 16oz can of roasted peppers.  I added some things I had in the house like a half empty bag of three cheese tortellini and a bunch of fresh asparagus spears (it looked very pretty).  The second time I roasted my own peppers and it was really good but everyone commented that the difference between the fresh and the canned was so subtle I can get away with not soing the extra work.  This time I only added fresh mini ravioli.  My sisters commented that it didn't really need any additions and I agree. I am making it tonight for a church dinner and I will leave it plain, but I will bring along some crumbled Feta - that sounds so good!  Thanks for a healthy, delicious and versatile recipe!",

With my changes....I prefer using great northern beans (not sure why they made a difference to me?) and I used 4 roasted peppers and put in a small can of whole tomatoes. Perfection!
