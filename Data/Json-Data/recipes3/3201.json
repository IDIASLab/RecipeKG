Can't leave that out!!\r\nIt was the absolutely the best lasagna ever!  I also used the no-cook lasagna noodles and just put them in the dish dry, it worked great- and saved a lot of time and mess.  I highly recommend these changes to anyone.  I will be making it again and again.  My boyfriend was ecstatic as well!",

I also kept the ricotta/romano mixture (to which I added a beaten egg and a package of frozen spinach) separate from the meat/sauce mixture. For the sauce I used my favorite garden vegetable chunky spaghetti sauce. This made for a lasagna that my boyfriend claims is my best yet! By the way half a package of lasagna noodles would have been sufficient. I ended up throwing away half of the pound. Thank you for the recipe!",

I used no boil noodles and used a total of 12 (4 layers of 3 across). I added a tablespoon of garlic to the meat mixture because I love garlic and left out the salt and pepper (it didn't need it). I used 2 cups of ricotta and 2 cups of cottage cheese. I also used a Romano/Parmesan mixture. I used more sauce than the recipe called for - almost 2 jars. I also added a box of frozen spinach to the cheese mixture and did not mix the meat sauce with it layering it instead. I only used 1 zucchini and that seemed to be plenty. The basil leaves added a wonderful flavor. I love meat lasagna and veggie lasnaga - this was the best of both worlds!",
