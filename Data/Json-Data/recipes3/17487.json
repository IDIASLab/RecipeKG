Freezing them prior to cutting makes total sense. But I'm wondering if anyone knows if you could actually freeze them OVERNIGHT so that you could prep a day ahead & then cook them right before a party or if that would destroy the \"rising\" factor of the dough?? Or if I should just make them right away refrigerate them and then warm them up in the microwave (or oven) just before the party?!?!? Thanks",

For the reviewer who questioned cutting the short (4\" side) that is correct. You cut them in 1/2\" slices which means 4\" equals 8 appetizers.",

They are a little messy to make with the croissants. After I rolled and cut them they didn't look like they would stay together. They cooked really well and even. I added more onion than required but that is my preference. I really like the onion in it without it they seemed like it would be boring. I highly recommend this recipe and can be taken even further now that I know how simple they were to make. Second attempt turned out even better. This time I put Pam on the baking sheet. The first time they stuck really badly but I was able to pry them off. I also bake the bacon first which is much easier than frying and very easy clean up. This time I prepared early so I put them in the fridge before cutting them. I think this made it a little easier to cut and you definitely want to use a serrated knife to cut them. They were still a bit messy and you don't think they are going to stay together but it all melts together and is so delicious. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone. It is one of the simplest great tasting recipes that we have had in a while.",
