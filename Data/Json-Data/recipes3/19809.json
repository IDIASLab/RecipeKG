I've made this recipe several times, and my favorite way to make them is to double the recipe, press the peanut butter part in a 9 x 9 glass pan, pour the melted chocolate over top, refrigerate, and then cut into small squares when thoroughly chilled.  It saves the time of forming each ball and dipping them.",

Only add 1 cup at a time.  The first cup you can use with a spoon, but the second and third cups use your hands it is so much easier.  Then after you roll them into balls, put the tooth picks in and then put them in the fridge.  I just melted the chocolate in the microwave (in a plastic container with a lid setting on top) because it is so much easier and quicker.  Just do it 30 seconds at a time until melted.  Then you dip the balls in the chocolate leaving a little of the peanut butter showing at the top so it looks like a real buckeye nut.  Do not cover the entire ball with chocolate.  If you don't like the tooth pick hole showing, just smooth it with your finger.  But honestly these are so delicious, who cares if there is a tooth pick hole.  Hope these tips help.  Thanks",

I did change a few things though, I did decrease the 10x sugar to three cups like some other reviews had suggested, and I used milk chocolate instead of semi sweet.  I also decreased the shortening by half and used a full pound of chocolate. Better to be safe than sorry!!!\r\nThanks Allison!!",
