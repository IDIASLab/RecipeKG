I put this in the fridge for a few hours before serving to let the flavors come together and just before serving I topped it off with the chopped green onion. Very good with assorted veggies and of course - ruffle cut chips!",

Also let it chill for at least a couple of hours so the dried onions will soften. Better yet do 1 day ahead.",

Start with the sour cream and the add a bit of soup and taste as you go along. The taste gets stronger as it sits. If you want some lighter fat potato chips to go with this make your own! Slice whole potatoes (fairly thinly) rince in cold water then dry. Line a baking tray with grease proof paper spread the potatoes in one layer brush lightly with olive oil and bake around 15 mns at 400 degrees in a preheated oven.",
