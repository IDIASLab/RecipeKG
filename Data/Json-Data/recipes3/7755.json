I took others' advice and used matzo meal as I had some on hand and just added it until I had the consistency I wanted. I usually drain the potatoes and onions but decided not to. It left the mix really soupy but I just grabbed a bunch of mix and squeezed the excess liquid out. By keeping it all in the liquid it actually kept the mixture from turning that ugly brown that it usually does. Needless to say I've found my new recipe that I will use from here on out! My husband tasted and said they are the best I've ever made!",

Reduced the salt to 1 tsp. served with nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream as it was what I had in the fridge. I can highly recommend this dish!",
