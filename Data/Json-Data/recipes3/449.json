I melted and molded chocolate to make a stem - so it was all edible. You could use any mold and the possiblities are endless with this one.

I had stumbled onto the popcorn cake and was so excited to try it. I am so sorry to say that I am the only one who liked the cake. It looked beautiful. The candy additions I used were awesome. Smarties mini rolo's chocolate covered pretzels all mixed together with that yummy marshmallow covered popcorn. I couldn't use peanuts as all kids facilities are nut free here in Toronto but still I can't understand why no one liked it. Not one of the kids took a 2nd bite. Personally I give it 5 stars because I thought it was delicious and a nice alternative to a traditional cake but the kids have spoken all of them. Thank goodness I made the cake pops!!!!!!",
