I sprayed the pan with oil, lined it with foil, coated that in butter and then poured in the mixture.  When cooled, I pulled the foil right out, put it on the cutting board and used the pizza cutter to make perfect squares.  I took the so-so first batch to work and kept the 2nd for myself.  :)",

Not quite, but it's delicious and foolproof...and you can go from the idea of fudge to a tray cooling in your fridge in 10 minutes flat. 2 important tips:\n\n1. Use salted butter. That pinch of salt is essential to the flavor balance.\n\n2. The fudge will only be as good as the chocolate you use. Pay the extra buck for Ghirardelli instead of Nestle and the result will be VASTLY superior.",
