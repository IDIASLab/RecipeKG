Also, 4 cloves was too much for my taste.  two was perfect!  Overall, great recipe that allows you the flexibility to make it your own!  This will be a regular for my home when we entertain!",

A couple of hints: I used a meat thermometer in the pork loin so it doesn't overcook and become dry.  170 degrees is perfectly done.  I omitted the cloves (not to my taste), and when making the gravy, I threw about 1/3 cup of flour in the blender with everything else, and then cooked it all together on the stove for a few minutes to help it thicken.  Delicious on mashed potatoes!",
