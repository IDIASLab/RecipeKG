Keep in mind that I am not a cilantro fan but I still think that the hot peppers would have been sufficient. The second sea scallops tend to be pretty thick & the cooking method overcooked the outside while not cooking the inside well enough for me. Next time I will skip the cilantro alltogether & bake the scallops for a few minutes before pan frying the outside. All in all a good recipe.",

I made the salsa as the recipe states except for adding just a tbp or so of mango vinegar ( a recipe from foodnetwork) but I made a few changes w/ the scallops. I used olive oil w/ just a bit of butter to saute them in but first I added big slivers of garlic & let them cook for a few minutes to infuse the oil. Then I removed the garlic & added the bay scallops. I hit the scallops w/ Old Bay & chopped basil while cooking & then sprinkled them w/ lemon juice after I removed them from the pan. I plated a bed of romaine drizzled it w/ the mango vinegar added quite a bit of the salsa & topped it w/ the scallops adding a few sliced cukes for interest. Hubby was very skeptical of this salad but had to concede that the flavor combo was superb. rubbing my fingers on my chest in an arrogant fashion LOL But next time he wants me to add a bit of mayo to the mango vinegar to make it more of a substantial dressing....I will for his I thought mine was just perfect! Served this w/ a glass of white zin & for dessert cherry limeade sorbet drizzled w/ homemade cherry vodka & topped w/ a couple of frosted grapes. What a wonderful light & healthy meal for a hot summer evening...thansk for your contribution Robin!",

I dredged the scallops lightly in flour before sauteeing them and backed off on the cilantro to about one tablespoon which was plenty. I served this on plates garnished with a spicy remoulade sauce and a lemon garlic aioli alongside a basic parsley rice. It was simply wonderful. Colorful fresh and delicious. I'm looking forward to having the leftover salsa with crab cakes tomorrow night!",

My only change was to add a tablespoon of honey because the fresh pineapple I had wasn't very sweet. Regarding the scallops - I always soak in milk while I prep the rest of my dinner. It helps remove any fishy taste. (Make sure they are dry when you put into the pan or they will splatter.) You need to heat a fry pan on high heat and sear the scallops for about 3-4 min per side depending on how rare you like your seafood. (2 min isn't enough for me.) By cooking on high heat you get a golden almost caramelized exterior with a nice soft interior. I made jasmine rice and served with the scallops and a large spoonful of the salsa. My husband went back for seconds and even my picky kids liked it. A keeper for sure! Thank you!",
