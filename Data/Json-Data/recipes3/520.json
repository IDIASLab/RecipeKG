I used chicken & substituted 1-kg of frozen Asian veggies (thawed) for the bell pepper onion & carrot. I also increased the following: soy sauce to 1/2 cup garlic powder to 1 tbsp and sage to 1/2 tsp. The blend of flavors was quite nice & subtle. At the last moment I decided to add about 1 cup of peanuts - just for fun. The dish was perfect with white rice. I'll definitely experiment with this recipe again!",
