I softened a finely diced onion (couldn't find pearl onions) in a pan whilst the milk mixture was heating in the microwave. I added the butter & flour to the onions added the milk and cooked till just starting to thicken. I then added some frozen green beans and simmered for 10 mins until the beans were cooked and sauce thick. Didn't use 1/4 cup of mustard as I thought that was excessive. How much mustard you need will depend on the brand you use & personal taste preference.",

I didn t want the mustard cream sauce to overwhelm the freshness of the green beans so I ended up drizzling the sauce on the top which is the way I will do it in the future as well. I do have some dijon mustard cream sauce left over because drizzling doesn t take as much. That s OK it went into the fridge and will be warmed up and served over a poached egg for breakfast tomorrow. The dijon flavor in the sauce is subtle and mild and it allows the flavor of the vegetables to shine through. Very nice side dish with good presentation.",
