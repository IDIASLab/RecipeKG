                "reviewBody": "I used this recipe as a foundation. My family likes a little more flavor and spice so I added a bunch stuff.\nInstead of breast I used skinless thighs and legs, mainly so the meat could cook in the sauce longer without drying out and gain the additional flavor. I cooked the meat in a little olive oil, onion, garlic (lots of it because I love the stuff), and ginger before adding the chicken stock. When I added the tomatoes and pepper flakes to the stock, I also added about \u00bc -\u00bd tsp. each of paprika, cayenne, and black pepper. Keep in mind that I doubled the recipe so this sounds like a lot of pepper but it really isn't. Left out the mushrooms because I hate them. Once the meat was close to done, I increased the heat to reduce the sauce. Do not reduce too much because the peanut butter thickens the sauce really quickly. ***This part is key*** Lower the heat and gradually add the peanut butter to the sauce. Do not dump it all in there at once and taste test as you add! I saw many complaints on here saying that the peanut butter was too overpowering. Just add as much according to your taste. The original recipe (doubled) called for 1\u00bd cups of PB and I used maybe a \u00bd cup. Also, I used a combination of Simply Jiff and a natural crunchy peanut butter to cut out some of the sugar. Skim the oil that the PB produces from the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add water to thin it out. \nAdded salt, not much, to taste at the end. \nServed with green beans saut\u00e9ed in garlic and rice.",
