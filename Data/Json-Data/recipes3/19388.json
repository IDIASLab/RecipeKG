Don't buy graham cracker crumbs.  Use regular graham crackers and crush them yourself.\r\n\r\n2.  If you have trouble with the butter not soaking through the cracker crumbs, combine them in a small bowl first and then pat them into the pan evenly.  \r\n\r\n3.  The order of ingredients makes a difference in taste.  This recipe puts the coconut on last which makes a great toasted coconut top.",

I had some technical difficulties  following step one (melt butter, coat pan, sprinkle in crumbs). This method didn't make the crust solidify so when I cut the bars, most of the crumbs were left in the pan. The second time, I combined the butter and crumbs in a seperate bowl, then pressed it into the pan. Much better. Also, I find that it is really hard to cut these out of the pan because the condensed milk sticks to the pan after baking. You have to chisel them out! The second time, I layered the pan in foil but now, the foil is stuck to the bars. Just keep this in mind. Alterations: I used chocolate/caramel swirled chips and substituted pecans for walnuts. Good!!",

As far as putting the Sweetened condensed milk  on the top or the bottom, I decided to warm the can slightly in hot water to make it  more liquid, then I poured half on the crumb crust and the other half over the top, this seemed to do the trick to adhere the crust together and coat the coconut as well. I let them cool for about 30 minutes, then cut them with a pizza cutter, but did not remove them from the pan until the next day this gave them enough time to set up properly and they were easy to remove and maintained their shape.",

I used 1 cup peanut butter chips, 1 cup milk chocolate chips, 1/2 cup semi-sweet chips and sprinkled over the crust. I omitted nuts altogether; mixed the milk with the coconut, poured it over the layers of chips; THEN topped with a handful of semi-sweet chips on top for a really nice presentation.\nVery impressive and absolutely delicious - finger licken' good!",

It is definitely for the sweets lover but the combination of the butterscotch with the coconut and semi-sweet chocolate really gives them a great flavor. Be careful if you put the bars in the fridge to cool they can become very hard a difficult to cut. I would advise cooking them the night before and sitting them out to cool instead. Also don't go wild with the semi-sweet chips they can overpower the good taste of the other ingredients. Finally I used regular butter instead of unsalted and they still tasted great.",
