I generally grill a flank steak for sandwiches or tacos when I'm feeling the need for something fun. It's got a Southwestern flair to it, but is still agreeable enough for my 4-year-old's palate. Or build a sandwich or some fajitas with some grilled onions and roasted red peppers... Delicious!",

There were things I liked better about this recipe but the one thing I did like better about the other one was that it used beer in the marinade. I doubled the chipotle pepper for extra kick but that was the only change I made. Next time I will ditch the honey and add some beer. Regardless this is an excellent recipe!",

Usually I make it as written but I have made it without cilantro before when I forgot to pick it up at the market and it was still good. I ve also used it on chicken with good results. But I like it on steak best even cubed and skewered.:) The meat comes out very tender and flavorful and serves well on salad plain with sides or as a sandwich wrap or taco. I love that the serving options are nearly endless with this. Definitely a go-to in my recipe box now!",
