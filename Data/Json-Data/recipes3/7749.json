I think it baked for 5 minutes too long as the top was a little crispier than I would have liked so next time I will reduce the cooking time or cover it until the last 5 minutes. I was afraid it would be dry so I added an extra egg and 1 T sour cream. The flavor of the browned onions really shone; I might increase those next time. Good simple side dish and a great way to use up leftover egg noodles!",
