Since the recipe says to dip the bread in the cheese mixture I was somewhat concerned because it was too thick to coat the bread just by dipping. The same instruction then says to \"toss to coat\" so I decided to just dump the melted cheese mixture over the bread cubes and toss to coat which worked beautifully. The cheddar released more grease than I was comfortable with so I skimmed off most of it before adding it to the bread. Tasty!",
