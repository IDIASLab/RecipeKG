This will keep the bananas from turning brown and keep it fresher looking longer.  also it is important to squeeze the pineapple to get ALL the juice out not just let the juice drain out using gravity.\n\nPlus you can then drink the pineapple banana combo for good health.\n\nAnother good tip is to freeze the \"crust\" part before putting on your cream cheese layer, this will make it easier to spread as it keeps the crust in place.\n\nanother spin on the cake is to use gramcrackers as opposed to vanilla wafers.  but both are equally good, its all preference.",

Because the kids all swarmed around the cake and then devoured it I didn't get to try it but they said it was \"really really good\". Before I added the whipped topping I drizzled a 7.25 oz. bottle of \"Twix Magic Shell\" (made by Smuckers) over the bananas put it in the frige to harden and then added the whipped topping. Oh and I also soaked the sliced bananas in the pineapple juice to prevent browning. Thank you so much Judy my nieces & nephews once again think that I'm the bomb!!",
