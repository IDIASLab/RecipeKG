I used a braised tofu which is a little more firm and tasty. Additionally I used about 1/4 vegetable broth and 3/4 boiling water for the base. I added the miso the bowl and added some broth and then stirred to blend it then added the veggies. I cooked the noodles separately and put them in the bowls to serve. Overall it was delicious!",
