I could eat it by the spoonful and actually I did! I got 15 cupcakes and about 2 spoonfuls left over of the glaze which went straight into my tummy! I topped 5 with the pretzel and potato chip and the remaining 10 I sprinkled with powdered sugar. Will be making these again minus the chip and pretzel.",

I wondered how it would have been to have used Baileys IN the cupcake rather than water as called for in the cake mix. Maybe next time. I got 16 cupcakes from the mix and next time I think I'd use a pan that made bigger cakes. I really liked the glaze for the top of the cakes! It was difficult for me to coat the potato chips and pretzels with the chocolate and butterscotch chips and so ended up using a knife to spread the melted chips. They were wonderful with that little sprinkle of ground (Starbucks) coffee!! I opted to remove the cupcake papers before dunking the cakes so that the topping could drip down the sides and that was a good idea. I served this to some friends who agreed that they were really good! Thanks so much Baileys!!",

The butterscotch morsels lacked the flow of the chocolate and it was difficult to spread all the potato chips and pretzels before the melted pieces cooled. I used a fork to try to spread some butterscotch over the chocolate areas. Messy but fun and I also suggest you make this recipe with a friend. The more licking of fingers the better! The recipe is also a bit deceptive in that these should be called cupcakes not mini-cakes. I was able to make 24 cupcakes and there was adequate glaze for all. I have friends who love chocolate dipped potato chips so this recipe would be right up their alley! Love the bit of salt in with the sugar and if you don't have butterscotch chips on hand you will be fine without them.",
