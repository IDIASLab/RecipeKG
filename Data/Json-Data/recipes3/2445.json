That would frankly be bizarre. Tomatoes are called paradicsom -the same word as \"paradise\"",

I browned the pork chops, removed them and sauteed 1 carton of baby bella mushrooms and 1 medium onion, which I sliced thin.  I then added the pork chops again.  I used 1/2 cup cream, 8 oz sour cream, 1/2 good sherry (not cooking), 1/8 cup ketchup, 1/8 cup tomato paste, 1 TBS W-sauce, and 1/2 tsp hot paprika, 1/2 tsp salt. I let it simmer on low for 40 minutes and added 6 oz cooked egg noodle and let them soak up the sauce for 10 minutes.  It came out really well, and my husband raved.  I would have given in 5 stars, but I changed it too much!!",

Also, I sauteed some onion and garlic with the pork chops, I used hot Hungarian paprika, and increased the amounts of worchestershire sauce.  This was excellent!

When my boyfriend and I sat down to eat- we thought the sauce tasty the chops were cooked right and juicy- the only problem was that the chops themselves only tasted like lightly seasoned pork chops! None of that tasty sauce (which was still too ketchup-y Definitely using some crushed tomatos and tomato paste next time) had managed to seep into the chops! My solution: Marinade! In a big plastic bag pour a nice mixture of however you're gong to concoct your tomato base w-c sauce and the chops. Poke the chops a bit with a fork before adding them to the bag. Leave in fridge for a few hours to overnight and cook the next day. This resulted in juicy flavorful chops that were complimented by the sauce rather than coated by it.",
