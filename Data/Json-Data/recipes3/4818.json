I added some garlic powder and paprika as suggested in other reviews and I used mayonnaise rather than miracle whip but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as it was written. It was very easy to make and didn't take too long. I made it the day before as recommended by someone else and it was delicious. It was a hit at the cook out and my daughter has pleaded with me to make another batch. It was lovely and creamy with a very nice flavor not overpowering at all. I will definitely be making this regularly much to my daughter's delight....",
