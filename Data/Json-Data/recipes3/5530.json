Can't wait to make it again with fresh tarragon.  I also seared the scallops over medium HIGH heat so they'd brown slightly in the oil and butter.  Heated the oil/butter 'til it started to brown and what a fabulous flavor.  Managed to cook the scallops to perfection which took about 4 minutes/side for medium-lg. sea scallops (not overcooked).  Scallops are a favorite of hubby, as well as tarragon, so I knew he'd love this and sure enough he did!  Thanks so much for the recipe which I am going to file in my \"favorites\" right now!",

Before I added the scallops to the pan I sauteed a few scallions first in the pan then added the scallops. I did not wipe out the pan either when the scallops were removed that's where all the flavor is. Word of Caution: Scallops cook very quickly.",
