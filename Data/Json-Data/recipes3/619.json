I doubled the amount of peanut butter.  It was plenty rich without using extra sugar.  Everything else was the same amounts. I did add 1/3 of a 12 ounce jar of Smuckers HOT FUDGE sauce to the bottom of the crust. Do not use chocolate syrup. It is too thin! I also drizzle some on top. You have to melt it to drizzle as it is very thick. This is the 2nd recipe I tried in the last 3 days. Everyone asked for the recipe - even the guys! Kudos for recipe!",

I upped the peanut butter to 3/4 cup, used only about 4 oz. of whipped topping on the top, and put a layer of hot fudge on the bottom of the crust before putting anything else on it. The fudge added a LOT! I drizzled some on the top too. I froze it and we all liked it better that way. Before eating I pulled it out and let it thaw for a few minutes. The fudge was gooey and so yummy on it! I will make this again and again!",

(half as much) on top would be better. Also, I didn't find the peanut butter flavor very strong, so I'd up the amount of that.
