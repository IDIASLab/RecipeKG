Then I cut the butter in with a pastry knife. I then added a 1/3C egg whites only and the vanilla, then blended with a spoonula until everything was moist then stirred in the chopped nuts. Used my cookie scoop to make sure the cookies all came out the same then flattened them with a fork chilled in ice water.  Next time I make these I am going to try and double the recipe as I can't seem to keep up with the demand for them.",
