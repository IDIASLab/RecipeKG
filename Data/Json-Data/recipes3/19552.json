First I simmered a ham bone with ham (for the recipe), carrots and onion in 12 c. water for 2 hours.  I removed bone and veggies and discarded.  I then took out ham and chopped.  I used exactly 6 cups of this broth to start this soup instead of water.  I also chopped up the 2 onions very small and carmelized in olive oil before adding to the broth and ham.  The rest I left intact except for substituting 1c. half & half for the 1 c. milk. I read where some reviwers didnt add the flour 'paste' and also left out the milk...I think if you don't use the flour 'paste' you wouldn't need the milk?  The 6 c. broth (or water) is perfect.  I used the full amount of cheese (velveeta) as this really is a HUGE pot of soup and I felt half wouldn't do the flavor justice. It was great!!!!",

I had an extra ham bone (well my mother-in-law gave it to me) so I simmered it for a few hours w/ 6 c. of water 2 carrots 2 celery stalks (w/ leaves) and an onion (discarding the veges before adding the other ingredients). Doing this made an excellent broth enhancing the flavor of the soup even more. I skimmed out most of the onion before adding the cheese because there was WAAAAYY to much. Next time I will add celery & carrots as well & maybe mash up a few more potatoes to thicken it some. Thanks Donna this is a great tasting soup!",

First I browned 1 1/2 small onions chopped in the big soup pot. 1 3/4 packages of instant mashed potatoes (10 servings) constituted with 3 cups of low-sodium chicken broth took the place of 7 potatoes and the smashing. I boiled the other 5 potatoes ham and onions in enough broth to cover. It seemed a little too thick so I added enough broth to make it soup-like. Then to get in some veggies I threw in 1 cup of frozen mixed at the end. At the party I served the soup from a crock pot on low. Don't recommend that because the soup burns on the side - not pretty. Definitely will make this again - mmm mmm!",
