Just eyeballing all ingredients- typically half an avocado (a little mashed), red onion as that is what I have, splash of rice vinegar (plain, again- what I have).  I had to sub zucchini for the cucumber when I ran out, also tried basil in place of cilantro when I ran out, and added a splash of lime juice.  I mix it all up and then put it on top of a plate of spinach leaves (even better to put in a bowl with tight lid and shake).  Easy, healthy and delicious.  I can't stop making it!!",

I cut it to 2 servings, and because I didn't have seasoned rice vinegar I made my own (1 tablespoon rice vinegar with 1/2-3/4 teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt).  I didn't need to add any extra salt, and the tomatoes I had weren't cherry tomatoes but rather the slightly larger pearl tomatoes.  Excellent!  Thanks, Kristen!  My lunch was delicious!",

In fact the hubster kept sneaking bites as I was pulling it together as he just couldn't wait. And neither could I; we finished it together while the steaks were grilling.

I was only preparing for two so I used only one avocado but only halved the other ingredients. I had leftover undressed salad from last evening's dinner which I used instead of plain lettuce so there were a few more vegetables in the salad - peppers radish. And finally because this was the meal I topped each serving with a sliced hard boiled egg and added a slice of garlic bread. I will make this again and probably without the changes next time - either way is just fine I am sure!",
