I also added fresh mushrooms and diced red peppers. Delicious and tender! The second time I used thinly sliced chicken and made this for a crowd of around 80-90 people. There were many compliments. I will be doing this again as it is great comfort food!",

Stir fried on high-heat, the finely diced (1st time I made it I bite-sized cubed the chicken-this time, finely diced-used my Pampered Chef mix/chop tool-that way you get chicken in every bite-very important!) chicken breast in 1 tbsp. butter, set that aside & continued w. recipe in the same pan, as written aside from the above mentioned changes.  Added chicken back when recipe says to do so.  Used 1/4 tsp. black pepper.  Hubby had rolled out some pie crust & we cut pumpkin shapes to go with this, just for a little bit of fall fun.  We loved this recipe &  will make again & again.  Thanks!",
