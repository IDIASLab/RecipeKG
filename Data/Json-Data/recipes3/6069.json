We loved it and my guests obviously enjoyed them as there were none left in the pan or on the plates. I did follow other's suggestions to add a bit more broth and left it covered for the first 1/2 hour of baking.  I did peel the onions, and one out of 16 lost its shape, but the others were fine.  It is important to pick same size onions and then cut them in half equally to prevent uneven browning.  Thanks for sharing!",

I served it as part of Thanksgiving dinner, and it was liked by all who tried it. To accommodate the turkey taking up the entire oven, I prebaked the onions to the point in the recipe where the cream is added, put them in the fridge, brought them to room temperature and finished them off in the hot oven with the cream while the turkey rested and we ate our first course. Thank you for this great recipe that I will use again.",

The rave reviews of the majority say it all about the heavenly aroma and melt in your mouth taste of this onion dish.  I made it first for Thanksgiving and a second time for Christmas this yr. - family loved them with both turkey and chicken. As others suggested, I covered the dish for the first 30 mins. of cooking to conserve the sauce - will increase the sauce next time as also suggested - no splattering problem, thus, no tray necessary. I used smaller (about 12) yellow onions about 2.5 - 3 in. in diameter and they were just great cooking for about 1.5 hrs.  I believe that there may have been a typo error at the top of the recipe when it said cook time: 2 hrs.?  Later in the recipe the cooking time adds up to 1 hr. and 30 min. max in step 3 with the cream being added in the last 1/2 hr. BRAVO TO THIS TASTE SENSATION!\n\n",
