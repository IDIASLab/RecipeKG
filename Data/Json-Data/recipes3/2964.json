I also prefer to crush the garlic instead of using it chopped (don't like to find bits of garlic), and better wait till the cucumber is completely dry if you don't want your sauce to be runny. What i do is to grate the cucumber the day before and allow to drain in paper towels overnight. This is good for d\u00f6ner kebabs, sis kebabs, mashed potatoes, salads, as a veggie dip,.....",

After you chop or grate the cucumber add salt to them and then let them rest on papertowels to get the water out. You can even give them a good squeeze if you don't do that the yogurt or sourcream will be runny. I used 1 tsp. of dill weed instead of mint and served this with Souvlaki. We loved it.",

This came together nicely.  Added just a touch more salt and a squirt of lemon juice.  Only had dried mint and used 1/2 tsp.  Let it sit for a while for the flavors to come together.  It was not 'soupy'.  Served this with 'gyro burgers' for a nice complete meal.  I like this recipe because it makes enough without a ton of leftover to get pushed to the back of the fridge.  thanks for the nice recipe.",
