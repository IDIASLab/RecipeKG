I subbed mushroom soup for the potato soup, onion powder instead of onions (too lazy to chop), half-and-half for the milk, only used 1/8 tsp salt, added 2 Tablespoons bacon bits and about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese--and I mixed the cheddar cheese in with the entire mixture with none added to the top. I couldn't taste the dill weed so will add more next time. I like this recipe because it doesn't call for a half stick of butter! Very good; I will definitely make this again.",
