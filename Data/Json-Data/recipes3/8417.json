I used pickle slices rather than spears because they make crunchier fried pickles and they're easier to eat.  When you make the slices there is a lot of the bread crumb coating left over, so it might be a good idea to reduce that part of the recipe.  Also, it seemed like there was an awfully lot of milk added to one egg.  Less than a cup of milk would probably suffice.  I'm going to try these changes next time.  I served them with thousand island and it was great!  I like ranch, too!",

I think i will try this awesome beer batter recipe I found on this site to make fish tacos.  I would have given it 5 stars if my breading hadnt of fallen off.",
