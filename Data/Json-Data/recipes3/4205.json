I didn't have Brandy so I added a splash of red wine vinegar.  The aroma was intense.  \nI didn't use a lot of OJ and added a hint of ginger to the juices.\nMy family loved this although I myself didn't feel my tasebuds pop.  I did like it and will make it again because the kids enjoyed it as well as hubby.  Next time however I will tweak it some more. \nAll in all, not a bad recipe!  Thanks!",

I added a little corn starch to thicken it up, otherwise, I think it would have been watery.  I made it with some egg noodles on the side and spooned some of the sauce over those and they turned out better than the pork chops.

I made a few changes... instead of olive oil i used virgin coconut oil (it added a light nutty flavor) and some rubbed sage to the pan while cooking the onions. As some of the reviews stated that the orange juice was too watery i used concentrated orange juice but did not add as much water as recommended... It turned out great!! very tender and quite a bit of flavor",

I have made it twice -- once following the directions as is and the second making some tweaks. The first time the orange taste was just too strong and there was just something that didn't work for my family -- although I am not really sure what it was. We didn't really dislike it but we didn't love it either. We liked the second go-around much better. I dropped the flour onions olive oil and brandy altogether and mixed together the following: 1/2 cup orange juice ginger salt pepper 1-teaspoon sage half a packet of Lipton Golden Onion Soup Mix splash of red wine and added a tablespoon of brown sugar. I then let my chops marinate in this mixture for an hour before covering them and baking them at 350 for about 45 minutes.",

We did change the recipe very slightly by using fresh Japanese ginger in the orange juice and used raspberry extract instead of the brandy. 350 for 45 minutes was no where near hot enough. We ended up baking at 350 for 60 minutes then 450 for 20 minutes to obtain a 140F internal temp. As these were quite bland we ended up adding a good portion of fresh ground Hawaiian lava salt and then finally doused them in smoked worcestershire sauce which finally made them edible. If I were to try this recipe again I would mix the orange juice with the worcestershire sauce before baking and then add a diced habanero tossed in just to make it memorable. This recipe most certainly does need tweaking.",
