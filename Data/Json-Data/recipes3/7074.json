You can also you dried salted beef but you must omit the salt from the recipe and soak your beef to remove some of the salt (not as quick and easy). I use 2 heaping tablespoons of flour per cup of milk (AR calculates that at about 3/4 cup). They changed my directions also. Add the entire milk mixture to butter and whisk constantly until thickened (5-7 min). For thinner cream chipped beef use pre warmed milk before adding the flour for thicker use cold milk.",

The only thing she did different was she'd start in a frying pan with the butter & melt over med heat, then she'd had the chopped/shredded beef, then she'd add the flour & kind of coat the pieces of beef in the flour.  After a \"Roux\" was kind of made, then she'd gradually add the milk & stir until no lumps were there. Then she'd add the salt (easy) & pepper to taste. Cut the heat up a little til it got thick & bubbly & then serve it over plain toast. Yuuummyy!!  Makes me want some NOW!!",
