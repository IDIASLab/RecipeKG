I will use shells or rotini next time or break the spaghetti in thirds. This is a definite keeper.",

I chopped the cabbage very coarsely used rotini instead of spaghetti used half of a large onion and added one small can of mushrooms (drained) and about a cup of frozen peas. I cooked the cabbage for maybe 8 minutes and I sauteed the onion and mushrooms in 2 TBS of butter instead of oil. Oh and I added just under a pound of kielbasa diced into the pan with the onion and fried it up a little before combining everything. I used more like 4 TBS of soy sauce and I only baked it for maybe 15 minutes. The only problem I had is that the pasta dried out a bit while it was baking. Next time I might omit that step entirely. But it was really good! Thanks so much for sharing Auntie Elmo!",
