I threw the green onions in the beef mixture during the last 5 minutes. I doubled the honey mustard sauce. Lastly I served this NEXT TO steamed white rice cooked with out the chicken broth.",

I used about 2 generous table spoon amounts of soy sauce and some sesame oil to give it an asian flavor. Instead of a green onion I used a regular onion. And finally I added about 1/4 cup of orange juice to the mixture. It turned out well just be careful not to overcook the steak.",
