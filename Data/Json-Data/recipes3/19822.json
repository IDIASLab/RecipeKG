                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe last night and it came out wonderfully!  I seared the steaks for about 30 seconds in the hottest pan I could get and then chilled them down again.  Also, I read in several reviews that you have to HEAT your cookie sheet or baking pan before putting the wellingtons on or they will get soggy on the bottom, this worked like a charm.  I got nervous about the cooking time when the pastry got brown (I had coated the outside in an egg wash that made it a beautiful golden color), so I turned the oven down to 325 after about 15 minutes, still left the meat in for the rest of the cooking time for a total of 25 minutes and they were perfectly medium rare.  I modified the ingredients to this recipe to include shallots and garlic (instead of onions) and spread the mushroom paste on top of the filet before wrapping in the pastry.  I had also squeezed the mushrooms after cooking in between layers of paper towels to get rid of the excess water.  I added about 2 tablespoons of gorgonzola cheese inside, which added GREAT flavor!  \n\nFor a sauce to accompany the dish, I would recommend reducing 4 cups of beef stock and 1.5 cups of port down to about 2 c. volume and then whisking in 1 tbsp butter mixed with 1 tbsp flour (mixed into a paste).  After it thickened, I stirred in some caramelized shallots, another tbsp of butter, and a few bits of crumbled bacon - season with pepper.  This was a combination of a few other sauces I've seen on this site and it tasted like something I'",

I had a little trouble rolling out the pastry thin enough, I wasn't sure if this was because I didn't thaw it enough or because I had one to many pre-dinner cocktails with our guests! This ended up turning out perfectly! I used leftover pastry and put a Christmas shape on each guest's wellington. I'm not sure that extra effort was appreciated but the meal itself was. I served this with a delicious sauce made from 1 c heavy cream, 1/2 c dry sherry, 1/4c flour, 3 T butter, 4 cloves garlic, 2c beef broth which I found in a magazine. I received numerous comments on how delicious it was. It was very very filling however. Even the men could barely finish theirs. Definately worth the time and effort! ",

Once out of the oven, \"tent\" with foil and monitor with a meat theromometer to let the meat get from medium-rare to medium or medium-well if you prefer. In the future, I will use less butter to saute the mushrooms and onions and will also add a liver pate/butter mixture (stolen from the other welly recipe on this site)\r\nto make this a real Beef Wellingon.

Even my 5 year old and 2 year old sons ate half a wellington each. I did serve this meat with a wine reduction sauce. I took one can of beef broth and 1 cup or so of red wine and a couple of tablespoons of butter and let them simmer for about 20 minutes, then added 1/4 cup of heavy cream and simmered for another 5-10 minutes. The sauce is super rich but complements the meal perfectly. I alos shortened the cook time on the beef because of other reviews and my oven tends to cook quickly.
