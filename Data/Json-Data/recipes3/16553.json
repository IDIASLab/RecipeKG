I preferred to use fresh spinach and garlic, some pepper and, because the artichokes I used were quite small, I left them whole.I did not cook this for 15 minutes though - just a minute or two to wilt the spinach is all it takes.  Great flavor and great eye appeal too.",

I put everything into a casserole dish, put feta cheese on top and baked it for a short while to heat the cheese.  It was very good this way.  I would suggest using a salty ham instead of prosciutto since you cook it anyway and prosciutto is more expensive.",
