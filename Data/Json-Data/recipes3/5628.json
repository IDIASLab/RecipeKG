When I made it the first time I loved the color and the freshness but wasn't thrilled with the taste. I had the leftovers the next day however and that's when it got good. I think this salad is like pico de gallo or baba ghanoush--you have to let it sit in the fridge for a while so the flavors can meld. Didn't add black pepper--I think radishes are peppery enough on their own. Changed the dressing a bit but that's because I have to conserve my olive oil and because I like things a bit mustardy.",

Turns out I had exactly 4 cups but the eggs had already started to boil by the time I had sliced all the radishes. I'm glad I only used 3 eggs though otherwise it would have been way too eggy. I really wanted to like this but the dressing made the radishes limp rather quickly and became watery when the radishes gave up their moisture. The odor puts me off a bit. This is a dish that I do not crave but I'm a weirdo and if I make something I absolutely must finish the whole batch (waste not!). Once I start eating it the dish is just ok. Edible but not enjoyable. I will not make this again.",
