I poured almost all of the soup mixture over the pasta before I placed the chicken on top so the noodles wouldn't get dry spots in them. Then I placed the chicken and peppers on top and poured the rest of the soup over it. It was delicious. He now regularly requests it.",

I had leftover roasted chicken so I used that instead of uncooked pieces. I had about 1/4 cup of Parmesan that needed using too so I added that to the sauce. I also used only 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup white wine (I know tetrazzini usually has shery but all I had was chardonnay lol).... Ended up mixing it all together instead of just pouring it on top. Pretty good and fairly easy... always a winning combo in my eyes.",
