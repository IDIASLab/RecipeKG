Not only does it taste great, but it's super versatile and easily thrown together for a quick weeknight meal.  I had every intention of following the recipe, but I did have to make a few tweaks out of necessity.  I had some baby bellas that needed used or pitched, so I used them in place of the cremini (and, I imagine any shroom would be great, per your personal preference).  As I was mixing the cream cheese and goat cheese, I noticed mold/fuzz on the remaining cream cheese in tub.  Having just got over a nasty stomach bug, I elected to be safe rather than sorry and pitched it.  I had no cream cheese back up, so I subbed lite sour cream and goat.  At the last minute, I added a little fresh mozz to help add creaminess.  These were delicious.  Both Mr. LTH and I thoroughly enjoyed them (he even ate my second half!).  I paired them w/ \"Best Black Beans\" for a simply delicious nutrient dense quick meal.  THANK YOU, rudechack!",

I have made this a few times substituting things based on what I had at the time also. For instance one time I made this w/o cream cheese...used baby bella mushrooms instead of cremini and plain goat cheese instead of herbed. I also find that red/purple onions are perfect for this recipe. Even my 2 yr old enjoys it with no complaints. It's simple you cant go wrong.",

I was so blown away by this cheese that I forgot about the mozzarella and didn't think it needed the cream cheese. I sauteed the shrooms added some sliced onions garlic salt pepper and the Balsamic. Reduced it and assembled this wonderful creation! Please forgive me as a side note. About this cheese I liked it better cold then warmed but I am still trying to get used to the flavor of goat cheese. This was a delicious and very unusual quesadilla!! Thank you Rudechack",
