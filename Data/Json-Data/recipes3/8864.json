        "description": "This is a flavorful, somewhat spicy version of New Mexican pozole soup made with readily available ingredients. A variety of peppers can be substituted to make it more or less spicy, according to your own tastes.  We typically serve it with the listed garnishes, tearing the cilantro leaves from the stems right at the table (much like basil leaves and Vietnamese pho). The Greek yogurt is a healthier choice to sour cream, although sour cream would also be very tasty! Great fall and winter fare, served with warm tortillas or tortilla chips. (Leftovers are wonderful, but good luck with that!)",
