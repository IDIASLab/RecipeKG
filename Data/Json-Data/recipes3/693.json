A little trick I use so they don't fall apart is to flatten them a bit with the palm of your hand. They still look nice and taste the same and they don't fall apart. I have never had any issues with this recipe and have never added an egg to it in order to keep the dough together. These also make really pretty spring flowers and you just need to change the colours of food colouring",
