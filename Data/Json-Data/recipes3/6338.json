I actually broiled some bay scallops and sprinkled them on top of the fish for an extra dimension of sea-food:-) Orange Roughy is a delicious fish with a light and buttery flavor. The fish guy at Wild Oats said that their population is weak which is why Wild Oats doesn't sell them anymore. He recommended Cod as substitute. Whenever I can get some Orange Roughy I love to use this recipe but Cod is good as well.",

Probably would not make it again as we don't like heavy sauces for seafood - but I can see the appeal for others. I will say that the reviews on this site piqued my interest about endangered fish. I had no idea that Orange Roughy was amongst those - no wonder it has been more and more difficult to find. It is worth doing some research regarding other species. For instance others to avoid include Red Snapper Chilean Sea Bass and Atlantic Salmon just to name a few. Hard to figure out what to and what not to eat these days:)",
