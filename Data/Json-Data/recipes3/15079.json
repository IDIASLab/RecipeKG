Two pounds of eggplant when sliced in about 1/2\" slices (the recipe didn't specify thickness) filled 3 cookie sheets which was a whole lot more than I needed to serve 4. The paste of flat leaf parsley garlic walnuts and olive oil needed to be put in a food processor to make it spreadable. I'll make it again using what I've learned and will add more salt.",
