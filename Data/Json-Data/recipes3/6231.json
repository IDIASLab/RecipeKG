                "reviewBody": "In regards to removing the lining, the submitter did not include that because you are starting with frozen \"cleaned\" chitterlings.  (See recipe above). The main lining (the most rubbery fatty layer) has already been removed. There are a few good brands.  But even though they have been \"cleaned\" I still go through every inch and remove any specks.  I also double check the lining just to make sure. A key step is to boil them after cleaning (I would boil at least 5 minutes) and then drain and start with fresh water. This will keep you from having to continuously skim the water (spooning and dumping any foamy grayish looking stuff that rises to the top of the boiling water), though there may still be a little skimming to do. Incidentally there is still another layer of lining that can be further separated leaving the chitterlings almost paper thin.  However I find that the final result is while tender, much too thin. You want them tender, but you want a feel like you are eating something. One more thing. Contamination/Illness can happen. Keep kids/babies out of the kitchen and wash hands/nails, counters, etc. thoroughly after handling (use bleach). The USDA even suggest boiling for 5 minutes before cleaning, to kill bacteria (will not change flavor). It also may help the cleaning go easier.",

I only cooked 10lbs. of chitlins which is 1/2 of the recipe but did not use bell pepper or bay leaf but the chitlin turned out great. However I cooked them for 7-8 hours -- I like them very tender -- and did not eat them until the next day which I think played a big part in developing the flavor.
