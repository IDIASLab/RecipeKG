I wished the vanilla was stronger but it does say \"hint of vanilla\" in the description. Here's what I'll try next time to coax a little more flavor out: I put the used vanilla bean into a container of sugar to make vanilla sugar which I've been meaning to try for years now. Next time I'll toss the scraped beans into the vanilla sugar to boost the flavor. I think I'll also infuse some oil with another vanilla bean and pop the corn in that. At any rate I will definitely make this again and again for our family Friday night movie and popcorn night.",
