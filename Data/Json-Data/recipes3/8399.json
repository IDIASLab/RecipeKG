But patient perseverance, and good ol' 'trial and error' saved the day. The original Old Bay&reg; Seasoning was invented in the 1940's by an American-German immigrant named Gustav Brunn. Initially, it was intended only for use on crab meat (as there was plenty of it in the Chesapeake Bay area where Gustav lived!), but in the last decade or so, it's used in other food areas, such as poultry and salads.",

Good 1st try but wonder if it would be better if/when I add cardamom to the mix. Used these seasonings in \"Captain Duarte's Salt Cod Cakes\" instead of Old Bay Seasoning. Its nice to have an alternative to running out to the store on short notice. Yes thank you for posting.",

It did not and no one besides me even knew that it wasn't Old Bay Seasoning in my dish. I'll still use Old Bay in the future because I'm too lazy to mix seasonings together if I don't have to but this was pretty close. Thank you Colonel for saving my supper!",
