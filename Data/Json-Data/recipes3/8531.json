I definitely recommend the fine ground after trying it. It just sticks better to foods. I ended up just using 3 good sized Tblsp of parmesan cheese for half the recipe or about 1/4 less and they were plenty coated. I also highly highly recommend using the larger asparagus which many wholesale clubs sale that are about 1/2\" or larger. They stay slightly soft still after grilling and aren't so woody. I will definitely throw these on the grill again for a quick side dish. Thank you",

I really liked this but wish I'd had a grill basket or the patience to thread the asparagus on skewers (as some reviews suggested to do) b/c flipping each one just didn't work out so well. Glad that I checked on the possible flipping at 10 min. b/c mine were done at that point anyways. Yumm-o!",
