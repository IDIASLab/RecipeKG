If u would like to convert to cream of tomato soup: make sure u puree tomatoes thoroughly reduce amt of broth by 1/2 & then use half & half milk or Land O'Lakes Fat Free half & half as a substitute for the other 1/2 of the broth. Tip: The Land O'Lakes fat free half & half is an incredible product. It makes wonderful cream soups while cutting fat & calories a great compromise & I usually lothe fat free products.",

What I do is to make this when I have a bunch of tomatoes that need using up. I halve the amount of chicken broth and use the fresh tomatoes (peeled and roughly chopped) with the canned. I then puree it all with a hand blender and if it needs more liquid I add more broth. This really improves the flavor. Anyway this is a good basic recipe to adapt to personal taste. Thanks Sara!",

Next time I'll try the suggestion given by other reviewers to bring the soup to a boil before I add the cheese. I did tweak the recipe a little based on the reviews I read. I added about 2T sugar which seemed to cut the acidity from the tomatoes perfectly. I also used water and chicken bouillon instead of chicken broth and I only added about 2 cups of water at the beginning. I added about a cup of half and half to make the soup creamier and near the end of cooking I added water until the soup looked right. I doubt that I used the full 5 cups.",
