I add a generous tablespoon of peppercorn, and 2-3 bay leaves. I recommend using WHITE vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar because apple cider vinegar has an unpleasant smell when it is cooked. When I was growing up, I hated when my parents cooked adobo because they used apple cider vinegar, and I thought it was smelly lol. White vinegar has a more pleasant aroma.  I noticed that many reviewers added a lot of sugar. Adobo is not a sweet dish.At most, there should only be a hint of sweetness. The combination of vinegar, garlic, and soy sauce is what gives adobo its unique flavor.",

I've read many of the reviews and it seems that the intended flavor of the recipe is a matter of taste.  Like your sauce thick or thin, this is a tangy dish.  Like it thin, then water it down; like it thick, then add corn starch; like it less tangy, add sugar; more tangy, add less sugar.  Smell while cooking is often pungent... normal for vinegar-based dishes.  But if \"tangy\" is your forte, then the \"pickle\" smell during cooking is a GOOD sign.  My advice on the dish- try this dish at a restaurant or elsewhere and decide if you like the general essence; if you like it, then try your hand at this dish, making modifications to personalize your tastes.  If you aren't hip with such exotic foreign dishes, then steer clear of making this foreign dish simply for the sake of trying something new and exotic.",

Otherwise, the actual ingredients are make a very basic adobo, and miss a couple of common ingredients.\r\n\r\nTry using red or white wine vinegar, but at a minimum use cider vinegar- white vinegar should be last resort.\r\n\r\nAdd the traditional adobo ingredients- 10-15 whole black peppercorns and 1-2 bay leaves.\r\n\r\nAdd  1-2 Tbls. of brown sugar.\r\n\r\nI recommend using reduced sodium soy sauce.  I like Aloha brand, but there are other good ones.\r\n\r\nI did not need to add water.\r\n\r\nFinally, try adding a cup of coconut milk- I like the ones from Thailand found in the Asian section of your store or at an Asian grocery.",

I loved the sauce so much that I buttered a casserole dish put in a cup of long-grain uncooked white rice(basmati) and put about five ladlefuls of juice(maybe 2 1/2 cups) from this adobo chicken and 1/2 cup of water and baked the rice covered at 425 for a half hour.

One of my favorite authentic Filipino dishes is Chicken or Pork Adobo so I was thrilled to see a recipe that was really easy to make( 5 Stars for Easiness) The downside is that I stayed home today while it was cooking and I couldn't stand the smell. It was pungent...The best description I can think of would be a jar of pickles cooking all day on the stovetop. My 5 year old would not stop complaining about it. I thought the recipe had TOO MUCH VINEGAR. I didn't take those other \"sour\" complaints seriously and I wished I would of listened. Even though I went easy on the vinegar added extra water and sugar the dish was still very sour and overpowering. Start off with 1/8 cup vinegar or less if you aren't used to Chicken Adobo. Then add more later to taste. That way your dish won't go to waste...like mine.",

My husband who grown weary of my experimenting and has been asking me to make a few dishes that \"originated on this continent\", absolutely loved it.
