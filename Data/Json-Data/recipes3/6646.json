When I read the recipe I knew I would not be putting apples in it and that was confirmed by the one review prior to mind. I put a few stalks celery and halved onions in the pot when cooking and removed when I removed the bones. This was delicious. My family loved it and it will be one I will make over and over especially after having a lamb dinner.",
