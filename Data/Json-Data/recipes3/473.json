But I can definitely say that this cake tastes wonderful. It's very moist, but light, and not too sweet.  \nThe first time my roommate made it though, it looked really gloopy -- the icing was sliding off, and the juice from the strawberries made smears on the cake.  Here's what she did the second time: she used less milk in the pudding mix (for the icing) to make it firmer. She handled the pudding/Cool Whip mixture as little as possible -- just enough to fold it all in, but no more. Finally, she drained the strawberries AFTER slicing them (leaving them in a papertowel-lined bowl in the fridge overnight), and blotted the slices w/ a paper towel before putting them on the ice cake. With these modifications, the cake held up much better, and looked as fantastic as it tasted!",

When I got to the 2nd step for the filling I was like what pudding? Anyways I went to the store and got another box of lemon pudding for the whipped topping filling. So the cake wound up having an extra box of pudding in it. The filling was so runny that it would not set up and the cakes were sliding around. It wound up looking like an avalanche. But it was delicious. If I were to make it again I would fill it differently maybe use real whipped cream instead of whipped topping or a whipped cream/cream cheese combo with the lemon pudding. But the lemon/strawberry combo is very good and the actual cake itself was dense and moist and really good.",

I originally thought it may have been too much since there were only 6 people there but everyone had seconds and there was only one piece left for me to take home. I am debating on making it again today....just because! its so tasty...i loved it!! also many reviewers complained about the frosting not being firm enough. i refridgerated the pudding and them when i mixed in the whipped cream topping and put it in the freezer to thicken it up some. turned out perfect!!! review edit: I made this cake again with jello brand pudding...BIG mistake. the \"frosting\" was so runny and i couldnt get it firm. i made another one the same day with generic lemon pudding...it turned out amazing!!! so i HIGHLY recommend using the generic pudding...its cheaper it taste better and it looks better....not to mention its easier to work with!!!",

I've since made it for co-workers and both of my kids who have June birthdays are asking for it too. I've made a small change simply be accident because my husband picked up MY T Fine brand lemon pie filling instead of instant lemon pudding. I decided to try to work with it mixing with 1/2 c sugar and 1c water then cooking until thick. It made a very simple mock lemon curd which worked wonderfully mixed with the whipped topping. The second time I made it I used the instant lemon pudding and it wasn't nearly as good or as thick and easy to work with. The error was a wonderful success and I won't do it any other way now.
