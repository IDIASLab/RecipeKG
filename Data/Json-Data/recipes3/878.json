I sauteed sliced shallots and chopped garlic in olive oil for about 4 minutes. I added 1/2 cup of white wine and let that simmer and reduce - about another 5 minutes. Then I added the evaporated milk and let simmer for 12-15 minutes. In a blender I pureed the shallot/garlic/milk mixture together with the cream cheese and poured back into pan on the stove. I added nutmeg salt and pepper to taste 1/2 cup non-fat milk and started slowly adding the parmesan cheese stirring frequently. I probably added closer to 3/4 cup of cheese. I didn't need to use any cornstarch as it thickened well on its own. Served with whole wheat fettuccini grilled chicken and steamed broccoli. Very tasty and light!",

Once it was the right consistency there was only about half as much as I needed for the amount of noodles I made...and I made less than the recipe called for! Next time I will make 2x as much sauce same amount of noodles and add more cream cheese and corn starch. It has a good flavor once everything matches up though...but it made for a long night of cooking..",
