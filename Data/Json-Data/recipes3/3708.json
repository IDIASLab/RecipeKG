They are served with a stew, or roast and gravy, or as a side dish. Good halushky should be light. Their lightness depends on the proportions used and on the method of cooking them. This standard recipe may be varied as desired. Dry curd cheese is preferred for a filling because a wet, creamy one will melt giving flat and empty varenyky or halushky.",

Mainly I wanted to comment on the review left by Beacon - whatever you are describing there ( was it noodles with cabbage?) is NOT halushky!!!!!!! As a full blooded Ukrainian born and raised there I can tell you that halushky as Olga put it best: \"... is a Ukrainian name for dumplings made of batter or thick dough mixture. Various ingredients are added for tenderness texture flavor and food value. They are served with a stew or roast and gravy or as a side dish\". My grandmother used to make soup with halushky (or z halushkamy for those of us that speak Ukrainian:) Personally I'm always looking for an authentic Ukrainian recipe with a twist - thank you for this one Olga.",

And I would not recommend it for the novice cook. I have been cooking for about 50 years and can rescue most anything but I finally just dumped this. There is nothing in the ingredients that should have been difficult to work with. But I do believe that hand shredding the potatoes caused them to just be too watery. I dryed them several times but it would have taken 5 lbs of flour to get any kind of workable dough to fill. They might work as drop dumplings? I tryed frying them like potatoe pancakes put onions and cabbage in the skillet with a few...all of these things should have worked but it just didn't. They tasted terrible. and I didn't think that was possible. So maybe it was just me having a DAY. But my advise is to try something else. This recipe needs too much tweeking your time is better spent on something else like perogie.",
