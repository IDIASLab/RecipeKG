THE SO-SO NEWS: This recipe makes enough for two 10\" deep dish pies even with piling the filling up very high. THE BAD NEWS: If the crushed ice is anything but the smallest pieces...and I mean smallest the ice will catch in the beaters and fling whipping cream ALL OVER THE KITCHEN. I do not have an electric crusher so I used the old standby hitting the ice with a hammer while contained in a strong plastic bag. I measured a cup of the stuff and put back into the freezer until I was ready to add to the mixture. Some of the pieces aparently froze together making a larger piece....AND A MESS OF MY KITCHEN. SUMMARY: Would I make again? If I needed 2 pies...yes. If I needed just one....No not worth buying another appliance just to crush ice.",

It was fairly easy to make.  What I changed, however: used only 2 cups of whipping cream and 1 cup of half-and-half (I just could not bring myself to use all that cream!), did not use the ice.  Could only find banana instant pudding in the store, so I used that instead of vanilla.  My crust was graham cracker, and the final pie was topped with coconut flakes.  Despite cutting the ingredients in half, I still had plenty of filling left over, and made little parfaits from it.",
