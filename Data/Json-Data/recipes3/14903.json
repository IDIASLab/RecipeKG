It usally runs about 40 bucks. Now that I have this recipe no more driving for wings. The only thing I did different was after cooking the hot sauce garlic & peppers I pureed everything in the blender. Not for anyone with a heart condition though. Thanx for a SUPER wing recipe!!!",

Instead of deep frying I broiled my plain wings for 1/2 hour and then placed them in a deeper pan. All of the seeded peppers and hot sauce and butter went into the blender and then poured over the wings. They went into the fridge overnight. I cooked them at 350 until they were heated through and the sauce was bubbly. Wicked yummy slow burn kind of heat!:)",
