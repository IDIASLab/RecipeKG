Nothing is ever going to be like flour sorry guys who don't know this. We are not gluten free people but we stay away from wheat products as they are really not so healthy for the body. Anyhow we will try this again as it was not a bust. Maybe next time I will wait the hour as specified.",

In the first try I added less salt than suggested and they needed more salt and were too thick for my taste so then I added a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of milk. Will probably try a variation with a little baking powder to make more lighter and or reduce the eggs to two. It is essential to leave them at least an hour for the mix to change as per directions. Maybe I will also try to leave them overnight next time instead of just an hour it may work better and not need the baking powder.",
