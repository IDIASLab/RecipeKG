Pay attention to this. I doubled the recipe, and you will too. Cut all the veggies FINELY. Spread the mixture over COOLED crust, because if not it is going to be soggy. And, of course, spread the mixture an HOUR before serving and then put it in refrigirator, do not leave it \"ready to serve\" overnight - NO. Use cream cheese warmed to room temperature, will be easier to spread. And yes, it is a little hard to mix it, a little hard to spread it, but when you add sour cream or mayo, then what you get? A soggy crust! Read the recipe, follow it and everybody will ask you to share your cooking secrets - GUARANTEED.",

The hints that have been peppered through the other reviews are really helpful. Mainly 1.  DO NOT use the entire package of dressing.  2.  Prepare the spread the day before and add a little mayo, it spreads easier  3.  Lightly press the veggies into the cream cheese spread with a spatula to keep them from falling off.\r\nEnjoy!!!!!!",
