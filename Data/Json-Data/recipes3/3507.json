Very \"pretty\" and VERY tasty. No guest would guess that it was soooo easy to make. Thank you much Brenda!!",

So if you try to get away with a cheap spag. sauce you may get a bland result. The higher quality sauces tend to have little chunks of veggies and more flavour to start with therefore your end result will be more flavourfull. I also added roasted red/yellow/orange peppers.
