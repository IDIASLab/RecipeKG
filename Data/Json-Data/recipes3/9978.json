I had to scale it way down and used 2 eggs, just 1 tsp of sour cream, and 1/2 tbsp to coat the dish, but it came out perfectly. I also tried cooking it at 375 degrees and the cheese came out all nice and golden, so if you prefer it that way, I would definitely say give it a shot. Also, be sure not to use too much butter to line the dish that you're cooking it in or else it all pools at the bottom when it comes out of the oven.",

Love to do a stovetop omelet in a bag as well as fritattas of all types. Always halve a recipe (for two of us) when making the first time just in case it doesn't pass muster so we don't waste anything. Worked nicely in an 8\" skillet baked about 20 mins. Sounded a tad bland so chose to saute bacon in the skillet first. After removal sauteed chopped onion tomatoes and jarred roasted red peppers in the same skillet with the bacon grease. Terrific! Added a dash of hot sauce to the eggs and also substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream (a norm for me). Yes a bit time consuming but worth the effort and will make it again. Thanks Sarigal!",
