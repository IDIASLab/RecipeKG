Instead of olive oil, I cook the veggies in step 2 in veg broth. I added a chopped zucchini to that step and halve the rice to make up for it. I lined the tortilla with baby spinach before adding the mixture. I skip the cheese totally and top it with chopped cabbage. I use enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  It makes a TON, so it's worth the time it takes to make this dish. It's not difficult to make, you just have to plan ahead to have it ready by the time you need it.",

The only comments I have are that I really prefer a saucier enchilada, so I would probably sauce it up with a traditional enchilada sauce not just topped with salsa next time. And, I ended up having to use two pans, because I could only fit 5 in my pan. When I rolled them tighter, too much of the filling fell out of the ends. This is not a quick meal because the brown rice takes so much time to cook, but it makes a large amount, so I could easily make this on an evening when I have a bit more time, to eat on a night that I don't. Thanks!",

I topped both with homemade enchilada sauce, more cheddar and queso fresca. Simply wonderful with a tangy slaw on top.
