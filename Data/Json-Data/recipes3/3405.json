I prepare this dish on a regular basis as it is quick, simple and delicious. This recipe can be made ahead of time. Simply reduce the amount of time to 5 minutes that the meat is simmered in step 4 to 5 minutes. Place meat in a covered casserole dish, finish off sauce according to directions above, pour sauce over meat and refrigerate. Reheat the dish in either an oven preheated to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes OR simmer in a pan on top of the stove just until hot.",

I dipped the veal in egg before coating with flour mixture with a small amount of seasoned bread crumbs (just enough to give the veal more texture when cooking) I also doubled all the ingredients (except veal) and added mushrooms in step 3. Before adding the remaining chicken stock (I used chicken broth) I mixed 2tsp of cornstarch w/ the broth. This Recipe is definitely a keeper Thanks Terri!!",

Totally. Saute the veal 2-3 minutes a side and leave it at that. Lean tender veal needs very little cooking time. Having said that if you don't overcook this it's out of this world (5-star) awesome delicious. Chicken breasts turkey cutlets or lean pork pounded thin would be fine substitutes for expensive veal scallopine. Best served with a lightly seasoned pasta (garlic and olive oil). For something a little different however I served this with \"Linguine with Marinated Tomato and Basil \" also from this site.",
