We use some \"Finlandia Rye\" pitas there about 4\" to 5\" across but the extra flavour and nutrition is great. Like many others I now omit the salt or I use a pinch of sea salt. My favourite change is to replace the tomato with red/yellow/orange bell pepper. Just cut the pepper into 1/2\" strips put about 4 on a pita between the cheese and tuna. Bell peppers have three times the vitamin c of an orange.",
