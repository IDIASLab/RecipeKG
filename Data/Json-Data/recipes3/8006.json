I have made a few adjustments... \n\nSo I made these for my best friend's Bridal Shower that I was both catering and hosting, so I had to make them a bit more dainty. I added red and green bell peppers to the filling, and made them smaller. After prepping 48 of these bad boys,(triple recipe) I have come up with a quick and simple procedure to make these worth the effort. \n\nRoll each biscuit flat, then cut in half horizontally. place a piece of cheese (I used sandwich sliced Cojack from Sargento) on each half, diagonally from each other. (I do top left and bottom right) then spoon a small amount of the filling. Fold the uncovered dough over (Top piece goes right to left, bottom piece goes right to left) then crimp very well with a fork and place on baking sheet. Keep going until baking sheet is full. Then baste each picket with egg wash (I just use my finger, it's faster and easier) and then re-crimp with a fork and reshape delicately with your hands. They should look like little clams. Bake until golden brown! \n\nThese were SUCH a hit at my party, and were the only item I served that had no left overs. I kept a couple reserved for myself, and reheated them the next day in the toaster oven, and they were just as delicious. \n\nThank you for an AMAZING recipe!!! I will be using this again, and again, and again!!",
