This recipe looks very basic next to it so I was a little skeptical that this would be as satisfying.  It was great (the parsley was key for us).  This stew has a short ingredient list, was a snap to prep and has a simple flavor that hits the spot.  It's a great one to make ahead as the flavor is better the next day.  Now I have two great lamb stew recipes! ",

It was very easy to prepare with basic ingredients I already had on hand and has a nice flavor. I've made it twice now exactly by the recipe and it turned out perfect both times.",
