The key is definitely as others have said, to flour the fish first - this way the egg/mixture sticks better and you get a better coating.  I could have eaten this without a sauce on the side - the mustard made such a nice addition.  At first I thought it was too much but it really wasn't - after it's fried it's not as potent.  We also threw in some garlic powder into the mustard/egg mixture (if you throw the spices into the potato mixture it will fall to the bottom and never get on the fish).  I used tilapia (apparently they dont carry grey sole or any sole for that matter in Virginia) and only needed 2 minutes on each side for a gorgeous golden brown coating.",

                "reviewBody": "Seriously crunchy fried fish - love it! I've made this twice now with the addition of a flour dusting before frying. The mustard takes fish to a whole new level of yumminess that will please both adults AND kids. A major plus is that by using GF flour to dust the fish, this recipe is GLUTEN FREE! I've made it with tilapia and grouper, both worked well. The first time, I prepped all the fish, then put them into the pan. The second time, I had more fish, so dropped each one into the pan as soon as it was coated. That was a mistake. The coating came off a few of the fillets and what remained was little gummy where it met the fish. So for fish perfection, dust all the fillets in flour, then run them all through the first dip/potato dredge, then all of them through the second dip/dredge, then finally fry them up, in batches, if needed. The short resting times between the steps made a REAL difference in finished quality. I let the fish rest on a wire rack, which helps a lot, too. The top of a broiler pan would work as well. The second time I made them I added cajun spice from the recipe for Maple Cajun Mahi Mahi and loved that, too. I put the spices in the mustard/egg dip. Terrific! This is a perfect base recipe for fried fish. The bottom line - the potato flakes, mustard, and rest between steps results in perfect fish! **UPDATE** Made tonight with GF bread crumbs and flounder, only 1 coating. Still super crispy.",
