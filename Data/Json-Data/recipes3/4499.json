First time was good, second try was excellent. I so think the grate needs to be super fine. Thank you.",

The size of the grate shouldn't matter, but you have to get ALL the water out and add flour until it won't hold any more.\n\nWe usually boil a ham shank for an hour or two, then drop the dumplings in with it. The next morning, we slice up the leftover ham and potatoes and fry them in butter. Mmmmm. \n\nThe most interesting part to me was my Grandma telling me how when they lived on a farm, this was what they lived on at the tail end of winter. Only the toughest, saltiest cuts of pork were left, and some half-rotten potatoes, but it was enough to stretch just a little store bought flour into a family meal. ",

One of my cousins called these \"Sinkers\", because they sink in your stomach.  So many people that I have talked to about eating potato dumplings say that they would have contests in their families when they were young to see who could eat the most.  They are the most asked for dinner for birthdays in my family.",
