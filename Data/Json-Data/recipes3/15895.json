The first time I made this I whipped the cream and folded the sweetened condensed milk into it and it deflated a bit.   Made for a quite dense ice cream but still very yummy.  The next time I mixed the sweetened milk into the cream before whipping.  My husbands favorite is mint chip so I added 1 tsp of Peppermint extract to mixture and whipped to stiff peeks.  Worked beautifully.  At the end I whipped in half a 10 oz package of chocolate mint cookies crushed.  Did not deflate at all.  Spread it into my vintage refrigerator dish and froze overnight.   Light and very creamy.   Only ice cream we will eat from now on.  Can't wait to try other flavors.",
