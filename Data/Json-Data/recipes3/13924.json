If I add or subtract , then it's a whole different recipe, soo I did as this recipe said, & it was SPOT ON! Never better. I make chicken hearts a lot, in butter,  or oil, like it says,  but the  mushrooms really added that extra great flavor. Onion is always great of course, , But this is a wonderful recipe. Thank you again. Cheers . From N.V.",
