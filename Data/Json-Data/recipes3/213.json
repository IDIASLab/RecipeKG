Perfection. They are very good for what they are a no-bake cookie. I was looking for something quick and easy to satisfy my sweet tooth and these were perfect. Thank you for this recipe. Oh and by the way it does say in the recipe to refrigerate them. Thanks!",

They are certainly easy enough and they used up some of that cereal we've got everywhere but I guess I'll try another recipe next time. Thanks for the recipe!",
