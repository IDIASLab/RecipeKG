Four drops of green food coloring sufficed for the tree coloring. I did not make the decorative swaths with candy drops but used multi-colored sweet sprinkles over the whole panful before cutting. Red hots were used for the tree topper. I do recommend getting the thicker pretzel sticks for the simulated tree truck the narrow ones break too easily when screwing into the tree bottom. These were admired and enjoyed by all young and old. They rapidly disappeared probably faster than it took to make. The older kids want me to make a second batch without the young ones present so they can gain the process and make their own batch.",
