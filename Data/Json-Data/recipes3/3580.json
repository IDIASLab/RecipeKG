I added a can of Campbell's cheddar soup and used only half of the shredded cheese. I also omitted the extra salt. The cheese and chicken broth had enough salt already. I put half of the potato/broth mixture into a blender but saved some potatoes cubed to give it some texture. I have a big family and they all loved it!",

But I can't leave well enough alone so I did make a few changes (or should I say additions) to the recipe including a few slices of bacon which I fried until crispy (for topping) and the reserved bacon drippings which helped cook the onions. I also put in about 1/2 cup diced celery and one small diced carrot to the onions. Like some other reviewers I also only removed half of the potatoes to be pureed since I wanted some chucky bits left. I also put in more broth just to make it a little \"soupier.\" But it would have been great without these additions! I received highest reviews from my mother when I surprised her with a freshly made hot bowl of this for lunch. She immediately called me back to exclaim \"Best potato soup ever!\" And she is a wonderful cook and grew up eating potato soups made by other great cooks as well! I couldn't have been happier! I wish I had made double the amount! I have tried various potato soups before... some which were passable and some which were great but this is the best yet. This is a sure-fire recipe and would be great as is or expouned upon. It was delicious topped with crumbled bacon and chives and I look forward to eating the remainder at supper tonight. Thanks!",

I sauteed a clove of minced garlic with the onions used Yukon Golds and substituted evaporated milk for the cream and it turned out great. The cayenne pepper really adds a kick.

The only think I'll do differently next time is leave bigger potato chunks when pureeing the soup.",

I like chunks in my potato soup so instad of pureeing it I mashed it with a non-electic handheld masher right in the pot. Left a bunch of small chunks but still thickened nicely. Used 2/3 cup cream and 1/3 cup whole milk. I didn't even see the cayenne pepper on the recipe until I went to review it so I will have to add it to the leftovers! Funny because as I was eating it I thought \"a dash of cayenne would be great in this!\". I used over 3 cups of potatoes and added 1/2 cup water to the broth to compensate. Didn't add any salt and used Tillamook sharp cheddar. Sprinkled fresh parsley on top of each serving for extra color. Served with focaccia bread for dipping. It made a great winter meal!",

I used half & half instead of heavy cream and a large can of diced potatoes and threw in extra cheese since I had to use up some Monterey Jack too. It was still plenty rich tasting and the kids liked it as well. I scooped about 1/2 the potatoes mixture out of the saucepan and put it in the blender for about 10 seconds. I left the other half unblended. It was a great texture that way. Plenty thick enough too. The recipe makes a lot. Thanks!",

Even with the heavy cream and all that cheese it's still not thick & creamy & smooth the way that I had hoped. We'll be sticking with the other recipe; won't make this one again.",
