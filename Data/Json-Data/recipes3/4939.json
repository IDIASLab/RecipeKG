I used real sugar and cut it back to 1/2 cup. I still thought it was too sweet so I'll cut it back even more next time. The amount of cinnamon was perfect! 1/3 cup milk for 1 1/2 cups flour didn't seem enough so I added a bit more. I also used all whole wheat flour because I couldn't find my all purpose flour. Since the whole wheat flour is heavier ti didn't rise very much. The topping was great straight out of the oven but it got soft the next day. I only put the topping on half the muffins.",

I did everything the same except used raw sugar instead of splenda (I didn't make the topping). I make muffins all the time and these are probably the most disappointing ones I've ever made:(.",
