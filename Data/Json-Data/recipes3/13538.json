Followed the instructions perfectly and added roast jalape\u00f1o for extra heat and everything was nice and tender but the parsnips. Next time I ll roast the parsnips alone first for an extra 10 minutes. The flavor was nice and me and the boyfriend both loved it served with naan. 5/5 will definitely make again.",

I used purple turnips carrots red potatoes sweet potatoes and leeks as my root vegetables and blackeye peas in place of lentils because I was not gonna spend 5 on a can of red lentils and some of my UK friends would substitute blackeyes for lentils in their currys. I threw in a tsp of shaved fresh ginger root. Korma is a milder curry but it was still outstanding.",
