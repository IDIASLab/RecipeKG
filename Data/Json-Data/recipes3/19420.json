I beat it until the egg white mix didn't slide around in the bowl when I tipped it- took about 15 minutes on med-high. I did not add the almond extract. They were a bit too sweet next time I will use only 1/2 cup powdered sugar or make sure I use unsweetened coconut. I will also double the recipe because 12 of these was not enough! My kids called them \"cloud cookies\" I will definitely make them again and again! Thanks for such a fun recipe!",

I made a few batches and experimented with different extracts but the coconut ones were by far my favorite! I added 2 drops of green food coloring with the extract. I think next time I might tint the coconut RED and the meringues Green... very festive! One more tip- instead of dropping them by teaspoons I put it in a Qt size ziplock bag and cut the tip and piped them on so I could add a slight swirl- they turned out great and look pretty- see picture",
