By choice I used 2 slices of fresh bacon. (instead of imitation bacon bits) I cooked chopped up bacon in the first step and drained most of the fat. I then cooked the onion and garlic in the remaining tablespoon of bacon fat. The sauce was a bit too sharp for our taste so I added 1 teaspoon of sugar. This was a very nice dish that I will make again. I would be inclined to use all beet greens in the future just for their flavor and texture.
