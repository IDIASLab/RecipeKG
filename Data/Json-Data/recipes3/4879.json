We threw in some red pepper flakes too. We've tried this with two Spanish red wines: a Rioja and a Ribera del Duero. Sarah and I agree that the Ribera del Duero (ours was 100% tempranillo) was far and away the better match. Looking forward to pairing the Rioja with the Beef Tenderloin Asturia recipe (from this site) tomorrow!",

I will need to make some adjustments to the method of cooking it was looking so much like the dish I remember until all that liquid went in. 2 cups total? I agree with the sherry and the port sherry alone is fine in the South the dish is served with the potatoes don't remove that from the recipe the skin of the chicken and the potatoes caramelized the sugar in the sherry and the oil amount was just right. Eat it with crusty rustic bread.",
