Also I used dried herbs as I didn't have fresh available. Oh and I didn't have balsamic vineagar so I used a splash of red wine and a splash of white wine vineagar. I did have to add a bit of salt and pepper to give it a little more \"ooomph\" too. I served it with fresh green beans and Italian bread. My husband loved it and was very impressed but my toddler didn't like the ricotta. Also I found that the timing worked out better if I put the pasta to boil in one pot and then sauted/simmered the onion/bean mixture at the same time. That way they were done simmering when the pasta was finished cooking shaving 20 minutes off the recipe time. It wasn't worth it to me to save not having to wash one extra pan.",
