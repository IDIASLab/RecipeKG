All the flavors blend together and the corn and walnuts blend in and don't sort of jump out on their own. I did tweak the recipe..I added a blend of olive and corn oil and extra lime juice. I used smoky hot ancho chile powder and paprika instead of the red chile powder. I also added the spices slowly to taste rather than all at once. Oh and I used thawed frozen corn instead of canned (I think canned has an odd flavor) and I toasted the walnuts and used my Kitchenaid mixer to blend it all together really well.",

Maybe could thin with milk or sour cream? Used 1 teaspoon cayenne and it was plenty spicy. Had a LOT leftover after party so must not have been a big hit. Tasted better after a couple days. The corn/walnut is still something of an acquired taste though.",
