Also try first with 1 jalapeno add more if desired. For those that don't know what a shiso leaf is... It's a Japanese mint leaf. Each leaf is about 3\" big. They usually come like 8 leaves per carton. They are usually found in the produce section of a Japanese store.",

I used a little soy instead of salt and green onion isnstead of regular. The wasabi and ginger are great. We had this with fried wonton wrappers - fun combination. Next time I'll go to the swank gocery for the shiso leaves - I'm curious about them now. Thanks for the recipe!",
