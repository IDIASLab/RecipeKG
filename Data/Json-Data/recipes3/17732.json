By halving it; it was a disappointing side- extremely dry and bland. I saw the original post was for a gluten free version so maybe that\u2019s the issue.  Adding all the bread crumbs and crackers (used cheez-it\u2019s) made this so dry.  I wasn\u2019t going to top with cheese for the full bake but in keeping with  the recipe integrity I did.  I wish I didn\u2019t.  The small amount of cheese burnt to a shell.  My final product didn\u2019t look like the posted pic.  I\u2019m giving it a 3 based on hopes that a GF version is the ticket.",
