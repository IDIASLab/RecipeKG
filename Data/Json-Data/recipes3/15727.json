All the individual ingredients taste distinct while blending seamlessly into one harmonious flavor bomb. Zucchini is our favorite veggie to showcase, especially if you take the extra 15 minutes to salt it, but pretty much any vegetables will shine.",

I think next time I'd go with extra firm tofu (at least of the brand I used) as it fell apart. Husband would have preferred rice or a noodle with this. Even with giving the squash a good rinse it was a little salty for our tastes so next time I'll probably use a different veggie and save the salt cured squash for another dish (nice trick though). All in all a very good week night meal that ticks the buttons for easy healthy and not too expensive.",

I think I cut the zucchini too big and will do them smaller next time. If you lift and gently fold the tofu into the mixture, it doesn\u2019t break apart.
