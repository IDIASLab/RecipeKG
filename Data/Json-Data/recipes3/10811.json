I made one batch with walnuts and one with pecans(fresh from the backyard) and both were delicious. I also added extra dates because i felt the original did not have enough and that was my most favorite part of these bars. I used a shallow small cookie sheet for my first batch and i think that worked a lot better; it was easier to cut and fill. The cookie sheet also made them a lot thinner which made them crispier instead of mushy. This is a super easy recipe!",

Because no sweetener is allowed for me (honey, agave, sugars, etc), I needed something sticky and sweet too add.  I also thought having extra moisture for the backing process would be better.  I added about a 1/4 c. Unsweetened applesauce and raisins in addition to the dates for the sweet,and made an egg sub from flaxseed flour and water for the sticky.  I also added in salted sunflower seeds so omitted the extra salt.  Worked like a charm!  Of course, if you don\u2019t need the mods, it\u2019s a great recipe as is.",
