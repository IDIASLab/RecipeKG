It does take a bit of preparation but it is totally worth it. I share this with my special friends. We use the necks and diggers for chowder; so with this recipe only use the \"steaks\". I like a squeeze of fresh lime on mine and we all love some fresh homemade tartar sauce. We are very blessed to have the opportunity to dig and enjoy these razor clams on a regular basis. I should also add that where we live a hungry man can eat no more than four of these enormouse clam steaks...okay maybe five. So you may want to adjust the recipe accordingly. Thanks for the recipe; it is exceptional!",

I cut the clam into 3 or 4 pieces you want them good sized and instead of fresh parmesan I use the parmesan/romano mix in the can with green lid. It isn't as chunky it blends nicely with the panko. It is a bit time consuming but once you've had them it doesn't seem like all that much work. Each time we make them the pieces get bigger and bigger so it doesn't take so long to fry them. I like them with fresh lemon squeezed on and them dipped in a little bit of tartar. They are also delicious just by themselves!!!",

The family thought the breading was a little bland....I really did up the seasoning in the flour...and I just kept the panko and parm...I think I will add seasoning to the panko mix....I fried fresh razor clams (mixture of foots and body). I heated the oil to 350 F and then fried several clams at once. For 3 I did it under 3 minutes total...the crust was a dark brown...this was a perfect time...I did not cook any batch more than 3 minutes....in fact most of my clams cooked at 2 min mark or 2 and 1/2 min mark. They were perfectly cooked. I found that I needed more panko than the 1 C suggested in the recipe. I also was able to cook 12 clams with this recipe. I had a lot of the flour mixture left over...so it might be worth considering to half the amount of flour...so not to waste...",
