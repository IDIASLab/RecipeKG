The flavor was pretty good but it needed a little something. We served it with sour cream on top. It was a nice change of pace for Passover...we are always looking for a new way to cook on Passover!

I did make a few changes--I hadn't bought enough spinach so I used shredded carrots for half the spinach and substituted a medium grated yellow onion for the green onions. I also put in about three tablespoons of minced garlic. But I didn't do anything to alter the texture and it was totally fine. My son did say that next time I should add something \"to make it a little more juicy\" so I might add a can of cream of mushroom soup but it's really good just the way it is. This one's going in my \"dinner regulars\" file.",
