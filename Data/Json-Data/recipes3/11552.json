                "reviewBody": "This was tasty but I did have a couple of questions about the ingredients. For the chicken I used a packet of Costco's organic chicken breasts that I cut into tenders. I cut the rest of the recipe into half. I wasn't sure about what type of bread crumbs to use so I did use my Progresso Italian crumbs; one cup was too much. Maybe half a cup with the correct amount of ingredients would have been okay (double of the seasonings would be better). Maybe real bread crumbs from a loaf of bread would be best with this. I started to put the flour into the sour cream sauce but I sprinkled a little in and it started to seize up so I probably added at least triple the amount of milk and it was still too stiff. I'd just leave the flour out. When using tenders the 20 minute baking time was just right. It sounds like we didn't care for this but we really thought it was a good dinner. Next time I think I'll use a couple of slices of bread processed in my food processor and try that. Thanks for our dinner tonight BLESSEDBYHIM33!",
