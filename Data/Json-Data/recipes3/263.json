Very simple, and very very good!  However don't make the mistake I did, I used a mixer for my \"trial\" pie and a mixer simply will not work, Follow the recipe directions and use the blender, makes all the difference. THanks so much for sharing. Mom loved this, and she can eat so little these days, it just made her day.  WIll make over and over again! ",
