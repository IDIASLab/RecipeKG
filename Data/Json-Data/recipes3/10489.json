After baking covered for 45 minutes the shells were perfectly al dente. I scaled down the recipe for 2 servings that could have easily fed 4 diners. I counted out 16 shells equaling about 4.5 ounces not 8 ounces as a half recipe would indicate. Kept the filling amount the same. This filled the 16 shells perfectly. Added 1/2 teaspoon crushed basil to the filling and another 1/2 teaspoon to the jarred sauce. Couldn't find Barilla's 3 cheese sauce so subbed with another brand. This made for an over-the-top richness. Would enjoy this dish with a vodka sauce. Steamed fresh thin asparagus for 1 1/2 minutes. Perfect addition. Would I make this recipe again? Yes with my recommendations!",

In the future I will omit the asparagus as it threw us off texture and flavor-wise. Also I'd substitute prosciutto next time as it was hard to find fresh in the south. Good prosciutto is suppose to smell and taste similarly to bacon. It should never feel slimy to the touch and should slice easily.",

The filling was a little bland otherwise so I added some Italian seasoning and onion powder for flavor and an egg to help firm it up. We're used to a smooth cheese filling in stuffed shells so the asparagus and prosciutto seemed a little strange texturally but they added great flavor. I used the Barilla sauce but I \"doctored it up\" with my own seasonings (I do this every time I use jarred sauce). I have to rave about the pasta shells! This is the first time I've used Barilla brand jumbo shells and the difference is amazing. Other brands are starchy and they never seem to reach that perfect al dente texture but instead get gummy and then go straight to mush. Great pasta Barilla! I'll probably give this another try omitting the salt completely mincing the prosciutto more finely and just serving the asparagus on the side.",

I only added half the salt but next time would likely omit plus might reduce amount of prosciutto to cut back on saltiness. Made half with asparagus (fresh steamed) and half without but the asparagus flavor is quite understated. My teen did not like this dish at all but the adults each had several shells each. Couldn't find the stated sauce so I used Barilla Roasted Garlic sauce. I wondered if the three cheese sauce would have been too heavy/cheesy. Overall pretty good if I do make again would likely make several changes.",
