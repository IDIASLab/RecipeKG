Over all a very good dish, but needs a few minor adjustments to make it even better.",

Rather than simmering the seafood in the tomatoes, I grilled a nice piece of sea bass along with the shrimp and some beautiful scallops on our Cuisinart Griddler while my wife cooked the tomatoes and garlic with some shallots and fresh parsley.  We preferred to omit the boldly flavored oregano.  A fresh-tasting, light but satisfying, healthy and delicious dish.  We served this with pasta with garlic and oil and a green salad.",

I chopped up about 6-7 large cloves a garlic, browned them in olive oil in my Wok, added the haddock and catfish.  Added the diced tomatoes and an additional small can of tomato sauce and 1tblspn of dried oregano.  Then,  I sprinkled about a tblspn of fresh cracked pepper into the mix.  Once the fish was cooked through, I added a couple handfuls of fresh baby spinach (very exact measurement, I know!)  Once that was wilted, I added the shrimp and about 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.  I cooked about another 5 minutes to heat up the shrimp.  Finally, I served it over spaghetti with fresh baked dinner rolls.  Yum!",

Secondly, I wanted to use some leftover cremini mushrooms that I sliced. I also added 1/4 onions slivered thin. After getting nice & caramelized, I added the garlic. Then I added a heaping tablespoon tomato paste from the tube. When I diced the tomatoes, I seasoned them well with garlic salt & pepper then I added Italian iseasonings & the oregano then added some chili flakes for a little kick. I also had some roasted jarred red peppers in the pantry so I slivered some of them up as well. I defrosted a package of chopped spinach squeezed dry, added capers & sliced martini olives. As a rule I generally follow the original recipe to the letter the first time but this was screaming more. The one thing that made this dish even more outstanding was a couple squeezed Meyer lemons over the entire dish. Then I grated some reggiano Parm on top. Note: I served this over angel hair pasta. While shopping at walmart one day I came across small boxes of Walmart brand spaghetti which is cut in half. No more getting out the big pot. I just throw in a handful in salted boiling water & it's so mush easier to drain & eat.",
