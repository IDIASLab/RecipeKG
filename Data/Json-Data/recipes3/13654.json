I've only cooked risotto one other time and was reminded how long and labor intensive it is to make (patience is necessary!). The steak was cold by the time is was done so I'd probably change the timing on starting the steak first next time as it only takes about 15 minutes to cook compared to the 30 minutes the risotto took.",
