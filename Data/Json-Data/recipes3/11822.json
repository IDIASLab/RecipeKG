I changed the method just slightly tossing 2 cloves of garlic on the sheet pan along with the tomatoes and roasted them that way. Once the tomatoes and garlic were roasted I removed the skins from the tomatoes (I love fresh tomatoes but dislike the skins in my pasta) and tossed the roasted garlic in the food processor with the basil and cheese. My family thoroughly enjoyed this pasta dish and I will be making it again.",

The pasta was terrific and couldn't tell it was gluten-free! I also added the arugula at the very end and cooked it until it was barely wilted. I'll definitely be making this one again.
