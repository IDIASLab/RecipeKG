The only thing I did different is to freeze the butter and then use a food processor with grater blade to quickly grate it and then immediately into the flour mixture & toss gently with a silicone spatula.  This works better for me instead of rubbing the butter and running the risk of softening the butter too much.  I cut them into squares, using a floured chefs knife instead of the biscuit cutter.  Thanks for a delicious flaky perfectly buttery biscuit recipe.",
