Nutritious and guilt-free not only is this delicious but it's pretty colorful and so simple with its few ingredients that it would complement almost anything. I didn't have smoked olive oil (nor have I ever heard of it to tell you the truth!) so I used the extra virgin olive oil option. Also I'm not a big fan of balsamic vinegar (generally too heavy and sweet for me) so I substituted fresh lemon juice which for me was perfect. This salad is great as is but I would be interested to try it with fresh dill or parsley. There are unlimited possibilies of course for other additions but in my view that would just \"busy this up\" and then it wouldn't be the simple yet perfect salad it is just as written. This will be something I rely on often since in addition to all the other things it has going for it it's made from ingredients I readily have on hand. Hope your recipe flys Lizbeth!",

I was given two large Zucchini from a friend's garden. I looked up Zucchini and found this. I wish I had made more which I am going to do tonight because it is so easy and tastes so good. I didn't have nor have heard of baby zucchini so I used a large one. A Vidalia onion instead of red. A green instead of red pepper. I also didn't have fresh basil I used the dried regular olive oil too and followed the directions to the letter. So I didn't change the recipe just used different types of the same ingredients. LOL.
