It is an excuse for you to finally find and patronize an awesome kielbasy maker, and something fun and wonderful to do with the mountains of turkey stock you froze after Thanksgiving. Make this in a really big pot you inherited from your really big family or borrowed from the Quaker Meeting House. Forget someone important to you at Christmas? No problem! Show up with a container of these black-eyed peas for New Year's, and bring a six-pack of dry hard cider!",

Leftovers turn from a bright and pretty soup to a thick ugly what used to be broth. Dark brown/purplish in color and not very appetizing to look at but the flavor was even better than the day before. Just something to think about before you dive into this. Leftovers is not a look I'd serve to company.",
