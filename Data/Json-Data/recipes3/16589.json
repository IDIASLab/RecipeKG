I used diced zucchini diced the mushroom stems artichokes and fresh spinach. Great overall idea with many possiblilities just watch that vinegar!",

Last time I used about 3/4 cup leftover cooked basmati rice, sauteed summer squash, zucchini, tomato, onion, garlic, about 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, and 1/2 cup chedder cheese.  I also like to add 1 beaten egg to help it all hold together.  If you don't have time to marinate, drizzle the mushroom caps (stem side up) with a little balsamic (not too much, it can be overpowering) or soy sauce and bake for about 10 mins before topping with the stuffing.",

I had to use my mushroom caps quickly but had no time to go to the store so I made a couple alterations - no eggplant so I used a mixture of chopped white mushrooms and summer squash (which actually made this very colorful!) fresh spinach which I just barely wilted in the pan and no fresh tomatoes on hand so I use canned diced tomatoes. Threw some oregano in there and also cut back on the mozzarella. Finally I had no time to marinate so I just brushed the tops of the mushroom caps with the vinegar - added a little olive oil to it also. I look forward to making these with eggplant or zucchini or whatever combinations I can come up with. Very versatile recipe! Thanks Elise!!!",
