Turned out great and can't wait to eat the leftovers",

It is also very versatile - you could use whatever veggies you wanted and you could add chicken or shrimp to make it more of a main meal for those who eat meat. I definitely recommend this one!",

I used a basil paste instead of dried and I used dried parsely and oregano. I chopped marinated Kalamata olives. I thought that this tasted very Mediterranean so I added some Feta cheese. After tasting it I thought it needed more cheese so I added some shredded Mozzerella as well. Next time I won't use Kalamata olives but rather the sliced black olives in a can. The salty flavor added a little TOO much with the Feta and artichokes. Maybe if I had left out the Feta the taste would've been better. VERY flavorful. Great!",
