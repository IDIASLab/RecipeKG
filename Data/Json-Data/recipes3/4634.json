The recipe was pretty easy to follow and the baggie definitely helped with the forming process. I kept the cooked dumplings in the fridge and just took out a single serving when I wanted to use them. I pan-fried them in a little oil until they were crispy on the outside and then served with kielbasa and sauerkraut. Very tasty! I would definitely do this again if I had leftover mashed potatoes on hand. Might try the cheesy casserole next time too.",
