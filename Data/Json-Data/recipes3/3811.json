My only suggestion, is if you have a tough time cooking the rice without making it sticky (a problem I always have), cook the rice separately and add it to the other simmered ingredients when it is done.

First off, add a can of Rotel Tomatoes with Chili's, and cut back on cayenne pepper just a tad  to make up for it.  Cut back the Broth To 1.5 Cups and cook your Rice separately using chicken broth/shrimp broth or both, lastly and imo most important, add, 2lbs of shrimp to the pot just as you take it off the heat, give it a stir, put the lid on it and turn the heat off,  (This will guarantee your shrimp turn out perfectly cooked and not rubbery.) Stir once or or twice every 2-3 minutes and and after 5 minutes have passed stir in your cooked rice and let set  5 minutes so the rice can soak up all them flavors,  Now taste, and adjust seasoning.  If your going to err,  do so on the side of mildness, people can always add a bit more hot sauce or creole seasoning.  NOTE: Cajun food is not about heat, it's about great robust flavors. Yes, it usually has a little kick to it, but rarely a bite.  I'm sick of people throwing in a ton of cayenne and calling something Cajun.  It's Not!  A GREAT RECIPE and had tons of flavor, I let mine cook about twice what suggested though before throwing in the rice as I really wanted to let them flavors meld. I also took the tails and shells of the shrimp and boiled them and used the stock to make rice along with the chicken stock, I got rave reviews.  I thought I was N.O. again.  Laissez les bons temps rouler! \nPass the Beer!",

I added a 14 1/2 oz. can of diced tomatoes, and used 1 1/2 tsp. of Tony Chachere's creole seasoning in place of salt & pepper. Omitted hot sauce as I don't like it too spicy. For my first time, this turned out to be fabulous...didn't use celery and it turned out just great! My fiancee went back for seconds, something he's only done a handful of times in 6 1/2 years.

As many of the others said the rice turned out mushy so I would suggest cooking it separately also.
