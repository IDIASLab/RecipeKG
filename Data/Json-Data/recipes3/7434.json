Also, I added some more shredded cheese to the top before baking. Also cutting the bottoms of the mushroom caps to make them flush will keep the shrooms from toppling over. I usually dont have too much filling left over but that will depend on how big your mushrooms are. I try to get the container with the biggest mushrooms and stuff em way up high. I am the recipe author, for those who think these are bland, add only half off the cream cheese and saute FRESH garlic with your onions. For all those who have extra stuffing left, again, add half the cream cheese and PEEL your mushroom caps. This opens them up so you can add more stuffing. This is a \"starter\" recipe that you can modify. I have gotten lazy and now throw all the stuffing ingredients into my food processor! EDIT: I have also covered the top of the filling with panko bread crumbs for crunch (it's now my favorite way to make them.) Cheers and happy cooking.",

I followed as stated, only my onion was a bit small and I put 1/8 teaspoon pepper in as I did not add as I cooked the onion.  The baking time is straight up.  If you use the stuffing mushrooms, which I was very happy to find, but wish I had bought two packages, because I thought it said stuff 12.. haha.. my mistake.  I might add that the comment by one person at the party was \"these are better than any I have eaten at a restaurant\".. GREAT job CC.. you made me a hit!  UPDATE:  For the poster below.. If you have leftovers, I just tasted.. Yummy on crackers, spread it on a bagel, stuff it in some chicken and bake.  Lots to do with just the filling.  ",
