I don't pre-cook the noodles and that takes care of the \"watery\" thing that some have complained about.  I prepare it the night before and place it in the fridge.  Then when you cook it the next day, the noodles come out perfect.  I also saute onions and garlic powder in olive oil and mix that with the soup mixture.  Sprinkle black olives over the top just before baking and it comes out perfect.  Great texture and flavor and sooooo simple!  A real keeper.",
