Too small to fry so baked them on a tray in a toaster oven at 350 for about 10 minutes. Before serving I spread mustard on the bread added the meat and topped them off with a small square of cheese. Reheated the \"burgers\" until the cheese melted. Did not toast the bread previously this made for a semi-toasted less dry bread. As for slicing cherry tomatoes? Forget it. Optional some grated onions. Made 24 appetizers with about 10 oz. of meat. My guests at my last party loved these they were tasty and not too filling for the dinner to follow.",

They are so good. Also for a perfect game day treat try this: Grill pineapple and fry bacon. Grill patties (I use the grill and make the patties the size of the bottom of a standard drinking glass - maybe a tad larger). Brush patties with bottled teriyaki sauce. Place patties on rolls with a small thin slice of the grilled pineapple a small piece of bacon and the cheese and/or condiments of your choice. This is our preferred way to eat them and my d/h and three kids agree. We'll be making them for the football games all winter!",
