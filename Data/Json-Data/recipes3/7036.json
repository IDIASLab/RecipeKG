I make it like Lisa Douglas (review below) - canola oil, throw in a couple of kernels and wait until they pop and then throw in the remainder.  Because the oil is at the popping temperature, there is little need to shake it - just a couple times and within a minute or two your popcorn is ready.  I also keep flavored salts on hand - like cheddar cheese, to shake on top once it's done.  Cheap and way better than the micro.  If you find your popcorn doesn't pop well, try this:  add a tablespoon or two of water to your container of popcorn, shake it up and let it absorb for a day or two.  The moisture in the kernels is what makes it pop.\nEdit:  I have to make a revision.  Although Canola oil generally is healthier, high heati creates trans fats which are BAD for you.  Peanut oil is a better choice because it has a higher smoke point.  (Coconut oil, while having a high smoke point, is high in saturated fats and one of the unhealthiest.)",

You can find coconut oil in the Asian section of the grocery store, and sometimes in health food stores.  It's white and firm at room temp, but it melts very easily and the second you smell it you'll be time-warped back to your childhood, and your friends will pledge their loyalty forever.\n\nThe brand of popping corn you use is key too - definitely go with the higher quality brand in a jar.

                "reviewBody": "This way of making popcorn was great! After making many batches of popcorn we now do the following: We never use/have peanut oil in the house so we use just the butter. Being vegan we use Earth s Balance non-hydrogenated vegan butter. The ratio that works best for us is: 6 Tbs. Butter (easier to measure on a scale - 84 grams) 1 cup Popcorn Kernels (we like the \"white\" popcorn best) 1 tsp. Salt. Sometimes we sprinkle some Nutritional Yeast Flakes (available at health-food and many regular grocery stores) on the finished popcorn for a nice cheesy flavor. We use less butter/oil than the original recipe but it tastes great and works well for us. Combining all the ingredients in the pot before popping is much easier than melting butter separately and having to mix it all evenly at the end. Thank you so much \"D.A. mommy\" for sharing this great popping method!",
