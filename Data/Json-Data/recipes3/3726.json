                "reviewBody": "Oh, is this a winner!  With a few little  \"adjustments,\" this is easily a 5-star dish, one I enjoyed every bite of.  I cut the chicken into strips, floured it, but didn't season it with salt and pepper until it was in the skillet, saut\u00e9ing in olive oil (pure, not extra virgin, for its higher burning temperature). When it was golden brown  I removed it from the pan as directed, and saut\u00e9ed the shallots along with some fresh minced garlic and a good handful of chopped red bell pepper, as it seemed this seriously needed some  color. To that I added both mustards, the chicken broth and white wine (which filled in for the vermouth because I was too lazy to go down to the basement, where we keep our liquor and wine, for the vermouth). I gave it a good squeeze of lemon juice but no pulp, then let that reduce somewhat  before I added the cream.  I let that cook over low heat until I had the consistency I wanted, adding more cream and broth as necessary while I tended to the rest of dinner. The chicken was so pretty and golden brown I just couldn't see tossing it with the cream and burying its rich color. Instead, I plated the chicken, spooned some sauce over, and gave it a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley. The chicken was sooo tender, and just delicious against the creamy, slightly tangy sauce. The combination of the two mustards with the rest of the well-chosen ingredients created a sauce that was just exquisite.  This is a simply lovely dish.",

The only things I did differently were that I didn't have a shallot so I used a clove of garlic (I'm a big garlic lover). I also didn't have heavy cream so I used whole milk. I don't think it matters much since you use so little of it. The sauce was still thick and rich and really flavorful. I probably cut a few calories that way. One of these days I think I might try a bit less butter or half butter half olive oil. Just to see if I can make it a bit more calorie friendly.",
