I do think you'll need to double the amount of everything except the ham hock if you want to get 6 servings. I guess it all depends on what you are using the beans for but 1 cup of beans doesn't make a whole lot. Might as well fill that slow cooker up since it will already be running for 8 hours. Overall good flavor and super simple. Don't skip the bacon!",
