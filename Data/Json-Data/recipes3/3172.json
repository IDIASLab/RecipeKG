It was extremely messy to prepare as well (my 9x13 pan was overrunning with the cheese sauce). My husband kind of liked it but says there's WAY too much cheddar cheese in it - I definitely agree. If you add other kinds of cheese to this (i.e. mozzarella Colby jack etc.) it will taste MUCH better. I don't believe that 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup is really necessary - maybe 1 even 1/2 a can if you want a \"light\" version of this. Be warned - even reducing the servings will make almost too much for you to handle. Unfortunately I think I'll be sticking to boxed stuff until I can find a better recipe for mac and cheese.:-(",

Used 1/2 lb macaroni one can of soup 1 cup milk 1 egg 1/2 cup cheese stirred into the mix and 1/2 cup for on top (I thought was plenty) 1/4 tsp cajun spice (will use more next time and maybe change to cayenne or just add 1/4 tsp of that in addition) and 1 tbsp dry mustard. This was so easy and creamy with the soup instead of a block with just shredded cheese. Cutting down the cheese to one cup total helps with sodium and calories and I used 1% milk and no additional salt (made my own cajun spice mix without salt) Will make again with changes!",

I halved the recipe added some minced onion and added a breadcrumb/butter mixture on top of the cheese. Also I cooked at 350 for 30 minutes like I do my traditional mac and cheese. Everything else was as instructed and it was excellent! Thanks for the new tradition.",
