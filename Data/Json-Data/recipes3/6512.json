Then, I added the bacon bits to the onions and mixed them until they were combined. Then, I poured the egg mixture (which was only the eggs and the milk) over the onions and bacon. I mixed the eggs around a bit until curds started to form, and then reduced the flame to low, and covered the pan. I let the eggs cook for about 5 minutes. Then I sprinkled the cheese over the eggs, covered the pan again, and let them cook for another 3 minutes. When the omelette was finished, I slid it onto a large plate, folding it in half. My boyfriend could not get over how delicious these were. Try it my way... you won't be disappointed ;)",

Because the cheese was added before cooking the oil in the cheese separated and I ended up having to drain the eggs before serving. The bacon lost its crispness as well because it was cooked with the eggs. The flavor however was very good. I will make this again but just cook the eggs with milk and onion first until they are done. Then I will stir in the cheese and bacon until the cheese melts.
