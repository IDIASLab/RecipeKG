I had all these spices on hand, and so I felt it was less expensive that ordering the spice from KAF. I found this Chai spice recipe to be a little too heavy on the ground cloves which tended to mask the other more delicate spice flavors. So I would suggest using 1.5 teaspoons instead of the 2 teaspoons of cloves that the recipe calls for. \n\nThis spice mix, despite the heavy clove flavor, was tasty. I do plan to use it again. By the way, these ingredients made a total to 3 tablespoons of spice mix. \n\nBon Appetite!",

I substituted chai spice for the cinnamon and was pleased with the flavor the chai spice brought to the tortilla chips. If you do this just be sure your mixture leans more heavily toward sugar than the chai spice. Enjoyed today for breakfast along with some fresh fruit and a small serving of Greek vanilla yogurt.",

I heated 6 oz of water, added a plain tea bag, 1/4 tsp of the chai spice mix, 3 tablespoons of half n half and 2 tsp of honey.  I let it steep for about 3 minutes.  Removed the tea bag and heated it a few more seconds in the microwave.  I enjoyed it and it was comparable flavor to a homemade chai my yoga teacher made for our class, which used whole ginger and oatmeal milk.   That said, I don't like overly sweet drinks, so I think most people would need to add more honey.  By comparison to the Starbuck's chai tea latte, mine was much less sweet and had a thinner consistency.",
