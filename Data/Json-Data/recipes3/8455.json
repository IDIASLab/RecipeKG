I only made two small changes: As another reviewer, I only used 1 cup of chopped cranberries which we found to be plenty! Also, I never had any almond extract so I decided to add 1/4 cup of toasted crushed almond slices. I am not a hugh fan of almond extact but using the real toasted almonds was amazing and really made a difference. Since it said to divide the dough into two logs I decided to add the almonds (1/8 cup for half the recipe) to one log and omit them in the other to test the difference. The cookies without the almonds tasted more fruity...you could really taste the orange and cranberry. The almonds added a more comlex and interesting flavor where all the flavors came through and none were overpowering. We liked both but the cookies with the almonds were our favorite! To toast the almonds: spread sliced almonds on a baking sheet and bake in a 375 deg oven for 3-5min until they look lightly browned. Let cool and crush.",

Made just the way it was told to make with the following exceptions:  I used 2 tsp. of almond extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla (just did the reverse of what the recipe called for) because I LOVE almond extract flavoring.  The cookies turned out great, and I only chilled them for 2 hours, instead of 4.  Good luck.  They turned out great in appearance and taste great.",

I reduced them to one cup.\nI have a tip that might be useful when using cranberries. You know how they come out of the  bag all clumped up? I put them in a bowl and sprinkle flour over the top, in this case using about 3 tablespoons, then, using my hands, I distribute the flour so it coats the cranberries and that helps to separate those clumps. It's so much easier chopping cranberries when they're un-clumped.\nEdited to add: my son's fianc\u00e9 liked these so much, she asked me to make some for their wedding.",
