I use russet potatoes instead of red potatoes and lots of chopped onions. I have never added the chives but I think they would be a yummy addition! The key to this potato salad is to make it the day before and let the flavors blend overnight in the fridge. Everytime we have a picnic/potluck and I bring this everyone wants the recipe and it gets gobbled up FAST!!! The onions and letting is sit overnight are key to bringing out the flavors of this creamy potato salad.",

                "reviewBody": "Whoa dressing and chive overload alert! This ultimately was very good but it can t be overstated that it s because I used roughly just half of both the chives and the dressing. The only way you could use this much of both is if you also used double the amount of potatoes! I believe my photo illustrates that using just half the amount of each coated the potatoes nicely with just the right amount of dressing and chives. I m surprised none of the other reviewers commented on this. Rather than just plain salt I used Jane s Krazy Mixed Up Salt a good all purpose salt seasoning. I also added some finely chopped red bell pepper for a little contrast in texture and color. I did not use the additional chopped fresh chives for garnish as was indicated. Holy moly no way! If I would have prepared the recipe as directed I don t think I could rate this any more than two stars as the potatoes would have been swimming in dressing! Reducing the amount of sour cream and mayo and chives by nearly half (with no additional chives for garnish!) elevates a 2-star rating to 4 stars. Creamy and delicious a nice departure from potato salad with the usual list of other add-ins.",
