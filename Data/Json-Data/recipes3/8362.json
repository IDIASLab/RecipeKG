Then I layered the pork chops with mozzarella cheese slice of ham shredded gouda grilled tomatoes then garnished with a mixture of salt pepper chopped oregano and chopped parsley. Excellent and well worth every bite! Served with Grilled Green Bean Bundles and Southern as You Can Get Collard Greens.",
