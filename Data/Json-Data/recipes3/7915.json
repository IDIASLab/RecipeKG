I know it would be basil overkill if the full amount were used and might even totally obscure any egg taste at all. I found the raw garlic rather unpleasant as well as the occasional bite of the red pepper flakes. I think garlic powder and cayenne or a little hot sauce would be better substitutes. Also for my tastes (or maybe the size of the eggs) I needed to add more mayonnaise. What I did love was the bacon! I think this recipe has a fine start and with some modification would be a first rate deviled egg recipe.",
