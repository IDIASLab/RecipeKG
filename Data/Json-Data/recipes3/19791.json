Substituted muenster for the swiss, increased milk to 1/2 cup, and added 1/4 c. dry sherry to the soup/milk mixture.  Sprinkle chicken generously with garlic powder, poultry seasoning and some black pepper before placing cheese on top.  Pour sauce mixture evenly over and then top with 1 1/2 cups Stove Top Stuffing mix(chicken flavor) mixed with melted butter.  Followed baking directions as written.  Sprinkled some grated parmesan over the top for last 5 minutes of baking.  Also, using lowfat evaporated milk is a great way to cut some fat and get a real creamy result.",

One can of soup didnt seem to cover all the chicken. I also topped heavily with chicken flavored stove top stuffing mix instead of the bread crumbs. That added alot of flavor. The only thing I will do differntly next time is use the low sodium cream chx/mush soup. My family absolutely loved it. The melted swiss chees and soup combo couldnt of been tastier. Will definetly make again!!",

I use combinations of soups to get different flavors.  My favorites are the Cream of Chicken Soup with Herbs combined with Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic.  I also use sour cream instead of milk with the soups.  I add some dried lemon peel and top it off with poppy seeds, Cheddar Fried Onions, and grated sharp cheddar cheese.  I'd tried it with crumbled Ritz crackers, and I loved it, but my husband is not fond of the Ritz on oven-baked foods.\n\nNo matter how you flavor it, these chicken breasts always come out juicy and tender.

Here's how I did mine:  I rinsed two chicken breasts, split them length-wise, placed them at the bottom of a le creuset French oven (it's all I have, but it worked just fine anyway), threw some minced garlic and fresh black pepper in there, layered ripped slices of Swiss cheese over the chicken, spread the condensed soup over it, poured about 1/3 cup of milk on top of that and then an equal amount of water on top of that before pouring a bag of stuffing on top. Then I left it in the oven covered for 40 minutes, removed the cover and poured a bit of melted butter over the stuffing, and let it cook for another 20 minutes. The stuffing cooks completely through without being dry, and while not excessively saucy, the chicken is moist and terrific with some plain rice and a side of grean beans. My boyfriend and I had enough for two dinners (it was even better the second day).  I would have added a little white wine with the water, but I didn't have any on hand.  Still, a yummy, easy, one dish meal, definitely worth trying.",
