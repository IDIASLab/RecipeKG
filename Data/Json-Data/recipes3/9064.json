The one thing I do that isn't in the recipe is that I reserve some of the cooking water (from boiling the potatoes). Just as the potatoes are finishing up their boiling process I scoop out two ladles full and add them to my bowl of cream cheese. This helps to soften the cream cheese and also adds moisture and creaminess to the final product.",
