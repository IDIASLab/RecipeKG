So I did half a batch with crushed rice krispies and half with crushed chocolate cereal (In my case nesquick). I hate semi-sweet chocolate and liked them much better with milk chocolate chips. You will need more chocolate than the recipe calls for if you dip them all. For chips I won't bother with a double boiler. Just microwave for 1 min and stir. Refrigerated them for an hour before I rolled them and coated my hands in icing sugar. Made it way easier. I used \"chopsticks\" (two straws) to roll them and get them out. Other than that I didn't change a single ingredient. I think I'll go get one now!",

(the recipe calls to add only 2 of the 2 1/2 cups to the peanut butter mixture then add the remaining half cup if needed... I only used the 2 cups and didn't even add the extra half cup and it was still too dry) I almost added a bit more peanut butter to help that out but I just proceeded based off of the instructions. The outcome was fabulous! I tried the peanut butter balls with rice crispys and my hubby didn't like them... with the graham cracker you don't get that crunch and they are more creamy... much better! Next time I make this I think I'll add some extra peanut butter and only use the 2 cups graham crackers for sure! Thank you for the good recipe!!!",

I tried toasted coconut grahmcracker and pecans and they were all great. One note: they are very rich and most agreed that even though I had made them small they would have been better if they were very small balls. Also if you find that the dough falls apart when you try to roll them into balls just work the dough a bit in your hands and try rolling it again. Def a must try.",

I made the recipe as listed using only 2 cups of the graham cracker crumbs but it was still just a bit too \"dry\" to form ball. I just added another 1/4 cup of butter. If you're making this in the first place the chances are calorie trimming is not the goal. That did the trick and the balls were doable. It is absolutely imperative to chill the peanut butter balls before dipping them as they will fall apart. Once they're dipped the cooler temperature helps the chocolate \"set\" more quickly. Using the small bit of wax really makes the coating shine. The big test: They were delicious!!!! Everyone loved them! Think I'll have one now.",
