Had no trouble dipping them in the chocolate after about an hour in the fridge. Messy work, but well worth the clean-up. I shaped them into eggs for Easter, dipped in bittersweet chocolate and then drizzled with white chocolate. Easiest way to dip: wear latex gloves. Put a Tb or so of melted chocolate in the palm of your non-dominant hand. Roll the refrigerated center around in it and place on waxed paper. Keeps the mess very minimal. This will give you a nice, light coating. If you want a thicker coat, wait until the first coat solidifies, and repeat. Double dipping gives a luxuriously thick layer of chocolate. Fast, fast, fast this way, and as painless as possible. For highest sheen, melt chocolate in a double boiler off heat. First boil the water in the bottom, remove from heat and place the top over the water. Reboil water as necessary (removing the top part) and put the chocolate back over after you removed it from the heat. Do this whenever the chocolate gets too thick, as well.  BTW, don't omit the salt in the filling as it provides necessary counterpoint to the otherwise relentless sweetness. Tastes reminiscent of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, but worlds better, like they came from an old-world confectionary! BTW, if shaping them as buckeyes, recipe only makes about 48 - 1\" diameter balls. If you want 60, then roll to about 3/4\".",

One thing I did that isn't in the recipe is to put the peanut butter mixture in the freezer for about 30 minutes before forming them into balls.  It made it much easier to form.  I then put the balls in the freezer for another 30 minutes before dipping it in the chocolate.   This made them nice and firm. Awesome recipe!",

I make as eggs for Easter, hearts for Valentines day and I use a shamrock cookie cutter for the St. Pat's day.  Instead of rolling in balls for the other holiday shapes,  I roll out between 2 sheets of parchment until I get the thickness I want.  I freeze the dough right on the cookie sheet.  Once cold I cut out the shapes, re-roll scraps and continue until all dough is used.  Keep everything well chilled or frozen so they hold their shape for dipping.  I use forks, not toothpicks, to dip.  Shamrocks get green chocolate and hearts get red -  you can find colored chocolate at craft stores.  lots of fun to make! NOTE:  Giant Reese cup pan-  use recipe as is.  a 1 pound dark chocolate wafers from Nuts(dot)com is plenty for the outer shell.  Freeze pan - brush up sides - repeat until sides are thick.  Fill and top with remaining chocolate.",

My mother used to make these for the holidays and since she is no longer here I wanted to not only satisfy my craving for the taste but to also have something to take me back to the days of her making them and BOY! did these do the job! They are soo good! It took about 2 1/2 cups of the sugar for me to get them to roll up into the perfect ball shape I popped them into the freezer for about 10 minutes and got my chocolate and shortening melted and here's a tip for dipping them. I put 4 or 5 balls into the bowl where the chocolate has been melted roll that around with a spoon and then lift them up with a fork to release all the extra chocolate! These are a definite keeper! Thank you for taking me back to years long since past! This is staying in my recipe box for sure!",
