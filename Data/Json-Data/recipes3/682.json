It will make your life a million times easier.  I also followed the advice of the previous reviewers and added an extra 1 cup of sifted confectioners sugar because we like our frosting sweet.  I also doubled the vanilla extract for a more intense flavor.  I had no problems with the consistancy whatsoever.  Since my husband likes the white frosting and I like chocolate, this batch made enough so I could divide it up into 2 separate batches.  I just took out 1/2 of the batch and set it aside.  Then I added 1/3 cup of pure cocoa powder (not hot chocolate mix) to the remaining batch and mixed it some more.  We each frosted our own 1-layer 9\" separate cakes and it was delicious both ways!  If you only have 1 cake, you might want to reduce the recipe by half.  Enjoy!",

I used a slightly different method:  beat softened cream cheese with vanilla until smooth, then add softened butter a little at time, beating until smooth.

For a less 'in your face' cheese flavor, I halve the cream cheese (8 oz instead of 16),  add 1/4 cup of butter, and one more cup of powdered sugar. The final thickness tends to vary on several factors (brand/type/temperature of the cheese and butter) so I add milk/powdered-sugar to give me the 'spreadability' I want. I use this as a 'base' recipe for frosting many baked items, changing thickness and flavoring to suit my current use. It isn\u2019t a decorator frosting for the real fancy stuff, but it isn\u2019t meant to be.",

Just lightly sweet and perfectly cream cheesy. Each recipe has its place, and I will make this again for any kind of bar or sheet cake needing a cream cheese frosting.
