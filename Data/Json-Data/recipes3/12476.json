I substituted roasted pepitas (baby pumpkin seeds) because I find they have more flavor than sunflower seeds so always have them on hand.  I doubled the chia seeds because they're so good for you, and sprinkled more on top for crunch.  The time & temperature was perfect. Wrapped in a towel still warm & cooled on a rack so it comes out moist. Perfection. Nutty, delicious & so quick and easy with no rising or fuss.",
