A couple variations we have used are adding sauerkraut with the cabbage, adding an envelop of onion soup mix, and/or using monterrey jack cheese. The original recipe doesn't call for cheese at all. It also calls for bread dough. You can buy the frozen dinner rolls (easy!). And they are delicious with Dijon mustard or spicy beer and braut mustard. In the original version you roll the dough into a square, place a large couple spoonfuls of hamburger mixture in the middle and pull up corners and pinch together and bake until brown. For crescent rolls, pinch two together to form a square, roll out and then pinch corners. Yummy!",

I was really skeptical of this recipe but it was amazing! I did end up putting in two cloves of garlic because they were on the small side...and I just couldn't use velveta for health reasons so I cut the amount of cheese way down and just used shredded cheddar and it turned out fabulous! Thank you so much for sharing this easy delicious recipe! Top 5 recipe for us now!",
