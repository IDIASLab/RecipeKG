Buy inexpensive frozen cauliflower when on sale and thaw as needed to make a single crust. Uses just a few ingredients I always have on hand. The seeds are carried in the health section of grocery stores, even in my small town. You could leave them out, but I recommend them for added nutrition-especially  iron, fiber, and protein.",

                "reviewBody": "Nutrition surely is in the eye of the beholder but for those who love pizza and want to limit processed white flour (as is generally recommended) this crust is a good start. The calories fat and carbs really are concentrated in the toppings not the crust. So if you re concerned with counting calories try alternative toppings as you would any other pizza that fits your dietary guidelines! I especially love how the seeds add crunch iron fiber and protein to the cauliflower crust and the convenience and cost-effectiveness of starting from frozen cauliflower. Hope others will try this crust as it s been a super healthy & weight loss-friendly substitute for me. As a flatbread I have frequently substituted it for wheat flour bread buns and pizza crust all while losing 20% of my body weight to limit diabetes risk. FYI I probably should have labeled this as serving two rather than one; I did have leftovers.",
