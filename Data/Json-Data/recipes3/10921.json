I used instant rise yeast and lessened the rise times. Recipe is very good as it even includes thermometer temp for bread 190\u00b0. It's cooling now. Thirty five \nminutes wasn't long enough. It smells good. I watched a Jenny Jones bread baking video which led me to this recipe. I didn't have whole milk only buttermilk, which I keep in case of a desire to bake, i.e. biscuits. Her recipe looked good but had a very short rise, and I just can't take a chance with both cost of ingredients and total time. I don't see a way to edit and won't slice until it's cooled.",
