I season it with salt & pepper as it cooks then top with the cheese. You can also scoop out a large zucchini, leaving the 'shell', chop it into small pieces and add the cooked hamburger, onion, and corn, mix it all together and put it in the zucchini 'boat' and bake for about 30 minutes on 350 in a 9x13 pan. Top with the shredded cheese and bake another 5 minutes. It also helps to slice a bit off the bottom of the zucchini so it sits flat in the pan. ",

And would add the salt and pepper in the begining instead of at the end. The cheese part is the same and would range from Chedder cheese to Colby-Jack cheese. Thanks for bringing back a great recipe to mind as well as the fond memories of grandma and me in the kitchen.",

I ended up with too much liquid but the corn squash and zucchini came directly out of the garden that morning so I think the moisture content was higher than with store bought ingredients. Adding different types of squash (I used 3 types of patty-pan round zucchini and crookneck) gives some extra flavor and texture. I topped it with diced tomatoes and some fresh cilantro to add color. My sweetheart loved it will defiantly make again.",
