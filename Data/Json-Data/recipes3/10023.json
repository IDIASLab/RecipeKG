I thought that the minimal seasonings (only salt and pepper) wouldn\u2019t give enough flavor, but it really brought out the natural flavor of the veggies.  I didn\u2019t have any cooked chicken on hand, so I grilled up a chicken breast. Speaking of chicken, 1/2 cup is not nearly enough for 4 people. That would be 2 tablespoons per person. I used a large 8oz chicken breast, which came out to just over a cup of chicken. This was the perfect chicken to veggie ratio. I\u2019ll make this again, and add in some minced garlic next time.",
