I mixed some garlic powder into both the onion mixture and the ricotta mixture as well as mixing some black pepper salt and a tsp of honey into the ricotta.

I drizzled about a tsp of honey over the top before baking.",

Should I have doubled the thyme (it seemed to smell so strong when raw)?  Some truffle oil? Stinkier cheese?  It left me wishing for just a little more something.  I found that for my two tarts, I needed to almost double baking time.  Very tasty.  May try it again if I can figure out something to boost the flavor.",
