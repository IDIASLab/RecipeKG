I followed the recipe except for adding a few mini chocolate chips and some chopped peanuts. I will make these again but I'll check them at about 7 minutes as I know they'll dry out/solidify once they're removed from the oven and cool. What I'm looking for is a granola bar that is somewhat soft but doesn't fall apart or crumble and I think that means less time in the oven. Nice recipe Naomi thanks for sharing.",

                "reviewBody": "I was low on granola bars and too lazy to go to the store so I searched and found this recipe. I have made it twice in the last week and it came out great both times. The first time I had no honey so I used molasses which was a strong flavor but tasty. The second time I used honey 1T. creamy PB and 1T. chunky PB and we liked them even better for the little added crunch of the nuts. My hubs prefers his granola bars crunchy so I pressed them very well then baked each batch for 15-16 minutes. I STRONGLY SUGGEST if you bake them to be crunchy you cut these bars fresh out of the oven. They will be sticky and I had to kind of press the bars back down along either side of the cut lines before leaving them to cool but after cooling they kind of just snapped apart in the pan but THEY STAYED INTACT IN THEIR BAR SHAPE. I cannot imagine how one could cut them into nice bar shapes if one waited for them to cool completely into crunchy bars but after cutting while warm it was easy. As an added bonus i just added any of the little bits that fell off into our cereal container so there was no waste. Love this recipe and the hubs was impressed at how \"professional\" they looked. I was impressed that now I can make granola bars that are preservative-free. Thanks for sharing.",
