I substituted fresh organic red chard shredded by food processor very finely for the spinach (one whole bunch) and fried it with the onions and garlic. Didn't use any carrot. Used half cheddar and half organic emmenthal cheese. YUM!!! I was truly impressed by this recipe. The quiche turned out with a good consistency not runny at all after 28 minutes in a convection oven. We couldn't stop eating it so between two thin adults we finished one pie. I couldn't really taste the red chard. Unfortunately not a hit with my two children under 4 even though I left out all pepper. Thank you for the relatively easy and delicious recipe.",

I also used fresh spinach and just added a teeny bit of water to the pan for a few minutes so it could wilt.",
