The spinach cuts down some of the super-strong garlic flavor. Use as a sauce for hot pasta, a spread for sandwiches, mixed with mayo for a spread or dip, mixed with ranch dressing for salad. The possibilities are endless!",

I started out with half a lb and ended up increasing everything else to the point it was a much less proportion. I used walnuts as I didn't have pine nuts and added the juice of half a lemon plus a few handfuls of fresh basil. It was delicious over penne with a fresh chopped tomato and additional parmesan. There was an addictive undertaste I couldn't quite identify. I will freeze the rest in ice cube trays to enjoy for many months to come!",
