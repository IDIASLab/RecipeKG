Make sure you cover the pot and don't stir it once it's covered. As long as the heat isn't turned up too high you won't burn anything, just let it simmer with the lid on the pot for 20-25 minutes and the rice will be perfect. \n\nAlso you are doing this dish a great injustice if you cook the rice separately. The whole purpose of putting it in with the rest of the ingredients is to flavor the rice, and you will not be able to do that if you cook it separately.\n\nAlso if you can't find File powder you can always use Okra as a substitute, but you will need to cook this dish a lot longer to achieve the right consistency. I would say you would need to cook the Okra for at least 30 minutes with the rest of the ingredients before you add the rice. Hope that helps.",
