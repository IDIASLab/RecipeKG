I chose to cut it off the cob raw and steamed it in the microwave for 1 minute 45 seconds to get the crispy texture I was looking for.  I was doing fine with the recipe until I reached the instruction to \u201cbreak up the potatoes with a masher.\u201d  No way I was going to mash any of the potatoes, I paid a premium for baby Yukon Gold potatoes, so I just cut them in half which worked out great.  I liked this salad but felt it was a bit heavy on corn, and I had small ears.  In the future, I\u2019ll most likely cut the number of ears back from three to two (could just be personal taste). I liked the combination of ingredients in this recipe, it was tasty, quick and easy, and it\u2019s a very different type of potato salad.   I\u2019ll definitely make this one again, it\u2019s a keeper.",
