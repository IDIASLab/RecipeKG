My friend's Mom makes this but improves it in the following way: Eliminate the pickle. Instead very finely chop two stalks celery & one medium very sweet onion. Place the chopped onion in the 2 cups mayo to marinate (it removes the raw onion taste) while u cook the potatoes & eggs. Cook potatoes till done (15 min or so). Cook eggs till done also. Drain potatoes & eggs. Peel eggs & chop. Put eggs in w/hot potatoes. Take two butter knives & hold them so u cut in a \"criss cross\" fashion to \"cut/slightly smash\" the potatoes. Add the mayo/onion mixture & the celery & mix lightly. If dry add a bit more mayo to taste. Season w/salt/pepper to taste. This warm mixture sounds odd but tastes heavenly. Perfect taste/texture combo. Excellent w/any type of sandwich baked ham brisket meat loaf roast/fried chicken pork roast hamburgers/hot dogs etc.",

I like to add a tablespoon or two of dijon mustard some chopped green or red onion some garlic powder/onion powder/fresh black pepper and add in the mayo gradually until it gets to the right consistancy. Depending on your potatoes you might need either less or more than the recipe states. This is really a great base recipe to just play with and make more personal to you and your family's tastes. NOTE: This is a great base for Cold Baked Potato Salad too!",

I couldn't help it and added a tiny dab of yellow mustard and a little onion powder. I cut this in half (except the eggs I used all 3 because I forgot to scale down) and it was a little dry so maybe next time I will add more Miracle Whip. My husband said this was like deviled eggs salad with potatoes and he loved this. I agreed it is our new favorite recipe and so simple too! Thanks for sharing Grandma Sophie's recipe.",
