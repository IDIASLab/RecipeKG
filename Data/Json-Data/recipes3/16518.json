I followed the advise of other reviewers and sauted the onions and garlic in 1 tablespoon of butter. Then I added another tblsp of butter and the flour and made a roux with fat-free half and half (thanks Lin) then I added the canned soup along with some Worchestershire sauce red pepper flakes paprika and nutmeg. Once this mixture was hot I added 2 10 oz bags of fresh spinach stirred it in covered the pan and allowed to cook for about 10 minutes. Once the spinach had wilted I added some freshly grated parm and poured the mixture into a casserole dish. I topped the spinach with bread crumbs and more parm and baked it for 20 minutes. This barely resembled the original recipe but it was delicious. Thanks for the basic idea.",

I always take a little bite as I go along and knew that I needed to do something to make this side more exciting. In addition to adding more spices I made a roux using fat free half and half and added in some parm. What a difference it made. Topped it off with more parm and a bit of paprika. Ended up making this in the morning and just popping it in the oven later on. Good start tho and thanks! BTW RogerBerry please let me compliment you on your advice about using your potato ricer to squeeze out the spinach. I've been struggling with trying to squeeze the water out of spinach for YEARS and never once thought of the ricer. You're a genious man! I'll be posting this helpful hint on my OurTableTalk.com forum for my friends to see. Thanks so much and I can't even begin to tell you how much time I saved!!",
