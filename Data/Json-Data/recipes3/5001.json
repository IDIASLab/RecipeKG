I should have followed my instincts.  Maybe it was the brand of alfredo sauce I purchased, but it was a well-known, high-end brand.  I should have tasted it before I dumped it into the pan.  It had no flavor that came close to alfredo sauce, and the texture was gluey, almost gelatinous.  I tried to fix it by adding some milk and some sauted onions and garlic, but it was no use.  My husband ate his, but then he'll eat anything. I definitely will not make it again.",

I checked here and this was #2- and I just bought some smoked sausage yesterday! I had the Roasted Garlic Alfredo by Classico which gave it an interesting flavor. I'll definitely be making this again and I plan on trying it with different types of alfredo. I omitted any additional salt since alfredo & kielbasa can be salty all on their own. Try it with fresh grated parmesan cheese on top- yum! I thought about adding peas but opted to stick to the original recipe- I can't imagine it would taste anything less than delish!",

Then I added the sausage back in, then the alfredo sauce and I used No-Yolk Kluski noodles.  It was very good.  My two year old son loved it!",

I used Ragu Lite Alfredo sauce and a turkey smoked kielbasa sausage. I used mini penne pasta because that part didn't really matter. The flavor was good but the sauce I think was a little thick or rich even for a \"lite\" sauce. I should have thinned it with some milk and/or dry white wine. I did add garlic while sauteeing the sausage and also to the sauce. I think some Italian flat leaf parsley would work with this and maybe even a smidge of spinach that is wilted in the pasta water. I may try that next time. This is a little bit like spaghetti carbonara but I like the carbonara better.",

Here's a wonderful recipe for homemade alfredo sauce with ingredients you can pronounce! (unlike those on the jar.) Melt 8 tbsp real unsalted butter in a large pan. Add 16oz heavy whipping cream 3 cloves minced garlic and stir well to combine. Let simmer until large shiny bubbles form then add previously sauteed mushrooms and 5 green onions cut up with scissors into tiny circles. Stir to combine let simmer 2 minutes then serve over your favorite cooked pasta. Simple delicious and amazing! You can also add sauteed shrimp or your favorite protein to round-out the meal. Happy cooking!",
