This was a really good recipe to use. I changed my preparation method but the end results were delicious. I hate peeling the hard squash. I poked holes in the whole squash and put it in the microwave. Once it was cooked I cut it in half and scooped out the flesh. While that was cooking I sauteed the onion on the stove top. Once I combined the squash and onions I proceeded with the dish. I didn't have goat cheese but I did have cream cheese. The casserole baked up nicely and cut in squares and served up beautifully. This was served with 'Sheila's Grilled Pork Tenderloin' from AR.",
