The natural sweet flavors from the pear and squash are perfectly coupled with the warm taste of sausage and sage. I've written the recipe for 2 people, but you could easily double or even triple the filling for more squash halves!",

The flavor and texture are great. The only tweak I made to your recipe was to cheat and use coleslaw mix instead of fine cut carrots and cabbage ( same ingredients just pre cut and mixed).",
