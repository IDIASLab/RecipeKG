I used homemade sofrito, but you can substitute with the Goya&reg; stuff. It's easy to make and delicious served with plantains. I like a lot of filling in my stuffed peppers, so this recipe only yields 4 peppers.",

I did use more than half of the spices called for and had no tomato sauce so I just used tomato salsa from the fridge. Also diced and added the tops of the peppers to the mix. The two step method of preparing the peppers was a bit time consuming but the softness and texture was perfect I'll use this method for other recipes. I packed the peppers with filling and easily had enough stuffing left for one more I suspect with the full recipe as written you will get enough stuffing for at least five if not six peppers. A hit with hubs I'll make this again. Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR Michelle!",
