Maybe the most important one was leaving out the last small canned of diced tomatoes- I didn't want to overwhelm the red pepper flavor and I think it worked. I also left out the celery just because I despise celery. Added fresh basil and oregano and just a touch of crushed red pepper flakes. Lots of salt and black pepper. Used freshly grated Parmesan. I have not yet tried it with the tortellini though I plan to. Yum!",
