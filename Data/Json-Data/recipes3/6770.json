I used chicken breast that I flattened dipped into the egg and I also added garlic powder to the seasoning. I used Italian bread crumbs for a little more flavor and I used canola oil in place of the veg. oil the caesar dressing was a nice touch. Added the sauce and let simmer for about 10 minutes. Added cheese to top of chicken and covered pan till cheese was melted. Turned out pretty good. Thanks for the post.",

Husband said its even better than his chicken cordon bleu...I marinated the chicken with caesar dressing when I bought it and put it in a foodsaver bag and froze it and so I skipped the flour and egg and beat the chicken breast and then dredged it in bread crumbs made of cereals (great solution for cereals that dont get eaten) and then fried the filets...came out awesome oh yes and I added salt and pepper and italian seasoning before I baked it. The Caesar makes the chicken tender and oh so flavorful!",
