Also I did not want to open another box of stock. I also added peas and will probably add broccoli cauliflower and/or ground turkey next time. To season I used some tumeric lots of cumin minimal cayenne pepper black pepper and salt while I was cooking the quinoa. This was a really good recipe and it leaves a lot of room for additions which is nice. I don't feel like I have to run to the store to spend 10 on one ingredient--these are all things that I have or will use normally. Five stars for convenience versatility inexpensiveness healthiness and tastiness.",

(I also think somewhere along the way my portions were bigger as it didn't all fit in my casserole pan) Thanks for a great idea!",

The quinoa cooked in the microwave in about 15 minutes stirring and adding liquid every five minutes. The casserole set nicely and browned around the edges in about 30 minutes. It made a very satisfying meal. Next time I will probably add another can of tuna and would be comfortable adding any vegetables around the house.",
