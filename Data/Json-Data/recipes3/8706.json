It would be nice either as is or with pickle relish and chopped onion or with onion and pickled jalapenos/hot-sauce/extra-salsa (or fresh). -- Actually I'm not typically a huge fan of egg salad so haven't been in the habit of making it. But because I found out that my husband has been missing egg salad I've been working on trying to find an egg salad recipe that I could enjoy with him. If I don't find another recipe that I like better than this one I'll be quite satisfied with this one. Hubs certainly enjoyed it a lot. However I'll keep looking since I'd like to find an egg salad recipe that has some 'wow' factor for me rather than just a 'very nice' egg salad. Hubs for one says \"Yum!\" as is.",
