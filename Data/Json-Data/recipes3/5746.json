You can dress this up or down depending on what you are striving for in a recipe. I love it! I don't add the garlic unless I think it will go with whatever recipe I'm using it for or in.

                "reviewBody": "This is what is known traditionally as labneh cheese, originating (like yogurt) from the Mediterranean/Middle East regions. It's basically Greek yogurt drained a bit more. Plain yogurt is very tangy/sour on its own, largely in part due to the whey. A lot of folks that don't like regular yogurt like Greek yogurt because it's had a bigger portion of the whey drained off, making it more mellow. If you're getting a really tangy/sour bite to the cheese, odds are it's still got more whey in it. The first batch I made I used just a coffee filter in a colander over a bowl. It was no longer draining, but still very moist, and in the end very tangy/sour. The second batch I put paper towels under the filter and changed them out every few hours in hopes of siphoning off more whey. It was definitely better, but still pretty sour. So I've bit the bullet and bought some cheesecloth ($2 for 3'x3' @ Walmart) and will be hanging my next batch. I'm thinking the weight of the yogurt itself will help press more of the whey out. For some good tips on things to make with yogurt and on making labneh, I would recommend David and Jill Fankhauser's site on milk/yogurt/cheesemaking. For now I'm going to take my second batch and try mixing it up with some leftover BLT bacon and some herbs. Hoping to make a kind of sandwich spread from it.",
