The common points with the original is the Tomato sauce the yogurt and serving it over Pitta Bread. The original uses calf meat grilled nicely on a vertical skew also know as Doner (from the litteral meeaning of the word rotating). As the cook rotates the skew against the heat source he or she slices the cooked meat than the thin slices of meat is placed over warm bite size cut pitta (no spices) and served along side with thick full fat yogurt. On the table very warm tomato sauce (slightly diluted tomatoe paste and olive oil) and sizzling molten purified butter is poured over. You can immitate these thin slices of meat by taking out a block of frozen meat and cutting it thinly after letting it get slightly thaw partially than frying the cuts on a teflon pan by adding just a little butter salt and pepper. Iskender is best made in Bursa Turkey. Consider Turkey for your holidays a little far from US but worth visiting for gourmet.",
