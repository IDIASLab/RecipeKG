Upon seeing what ingrediants were called for, I decided that a vegetable was needed to add color (and I like some sort a veggie in all my pastas).  approx 2 min before the pasta was finished, I added half a bag of frozen chopped broccoli.  Also, when the chicken and garlic was almost done, I sauted a half cup of red bell peppers and half cup of fresh sliced muchrooms.  Finally, to thicken the sauce, I added 1/2 cup of parmesen cheese rather than the required 1/4 cup. I was worried that I might of altered the original recipe too much but rather when all was said and done...it was WONDERFUL!! My family won't eat it any other way. My 5 yr old always has 2 servings and even my picky brother in law (age 15)scarfed 2 helpings down...muchrooms and all. This is a great and easy recipe that anyone can do and if you want to add your fav veggie like I did, I think there is plenty of room for experimentation.  I have made this many times since and my taste buds never tire of it.  It is worth a try and then..try to see what you can do with it to make it better suit your tastes.",

I've made it 3 times and made the following revisions: Definitely use fresh basil (2tsp dried should be 2tbs fresh) add a chopped shallot to perk up the flavor and double the sauce. There's enough fat in this dish already so saute in olive oil instead of butter. To make the presentation more attractive use tricolor rotini and throw in a couple generous handfuls of frozen petite peas during the last 3 minutes of boiling the pasta.",

I definitely recommend trying that. It takes the bitterness of the parm out of the dish. I think you can make it with just about any hearty pasta shape. I've made it with fusilli and farfelle and today am going to try it with pappardelle. Fantastic recipe. My thanks to Stacey and the other reviewers.",

                "reviewBody": "I believe that this is actually a 4.5 star recipe but still excellent! I made a few changes to suit health and ingredients I had on hand. Used spaghetti which was nice but next time I would try a rotini or similar. I had cooked the cubed chicken ahead of time in onions and garlic- added flavor. I substituted a mix of Greek yogurt and milk for cream. I also doubled the amount of 'cream' I added- and it still wasn't enough! Next time I'll triple it (the better to dip bread in)! This recipe made enough for 3 or 4 people. The taste of the sauce was excellent and it was quick to make. Will make again! 2nd making comments: Perfect for a dinner party. Use rotini or similar because it s perfect for the sauce. My earlier comments about needing more sauce are spot on make much more sauce than you think you ll need. Also when making for guests make sure that you do use a majority of cream or the sauce might curdle (example: I used 2 c cream and 1 c yogurt/milk mix and this was perfect but a remake the next day with only yogurt/milk curdled. Tastes ok (not as good as w cream) but looked funny). Elegant tasting and easy. Be sure to use good Parmesan. Also this would support a variety of veggies added to it experiment!",
