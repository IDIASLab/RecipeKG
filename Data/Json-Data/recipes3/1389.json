I've tried many different drink versions. white russian using kahlua & vodka & van pudding. Mudslides are choc pudding, w/kahlua, vodka & any Irish cream. Appletini's use apple pucker, vodka & van pudding. Washington apple, apple pucker & whiskey, Buttery nipples, use butterscotch pudding , choc liquor, kahlua & ameretto. Tiramisu seems to be my friends favorite. Van pudding, kahlua & ameretto. You could also make the pudding & instead of making shots make it a trifle with lady fingers for the tiramisu & pound cake or brownies for the rest of the different puddings. Add layers of cake, pudding shot mixes & cool whip, repeat layers. Fruit such as strawberries & bananas can also be added. If you want to make virgin style use 2 cups of flavored international creamers instead of the liquor & the milk. It tastes just as good(like there is liquor in them) & no one will know the difference. The creamer actually makes it better. I use 1/2 creamer & 1/2 liquor. Since experimenting I no longer use milk at all.",

Don't limit yourself to Irish Cream and Vokda for alcohol choices.  Sub out the Vodka for things like coffee liqueur (like Starbucks) or even Gold Schlagger.
