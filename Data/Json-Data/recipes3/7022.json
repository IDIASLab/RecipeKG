The only changes I made were to sub onion powder for the grated onion and I used the packaged real bacon bits instead of frying bacon. I also added a but more mayo - maybe 2 T more just for personal taste. Overall fantastic pimento cheese.. Oh and don't forget the avocado Never would've thought it belonged on a pimento cheese sandwich but it REALLY goes well. Thanks for a great recipe..",

The only thing I do different is use onion powder instead of grated onion for my picky husband! We have also discovered it is great as a dip/spread at a party with toasted baguettes. We LOVE putting it (generously) on a slice of sourdough sticking it in the toaster over and letting it just start to brown on the top....it is so melty and gooey! Perfect recipe.....think I will go make it now! =0)",
