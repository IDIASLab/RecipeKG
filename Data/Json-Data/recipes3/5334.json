If you want the chicken, lamb and sausage to come off the grill at the same time, stagger them, starting with the chicken, then the lamb and finally the pre-steamed sausages, which simply need to be browned. Grill in batches for a larger crowd, cooking all the drumsticks, then all the sausages and finally the chops. The drumsticks are fine at room temperature, but the sausage and chops should be at least warm.",

I recall using 1 clove crushed garlic instead of the powder and used a few 'grinds' of fresh ginger instead of powder. Subbed balsamic for the red wine vinegar. I omitted the sausage and just did this with lamb pieces. Marinated overnight in the fridge and it was great flavor at the picnic the next day done on the grill. Very tenderizing marinade with great flavor. Also added some Kosher salt to the marinade and a little Harissa for spice. This is a great grill marinade and would be great with chicken as well.",
