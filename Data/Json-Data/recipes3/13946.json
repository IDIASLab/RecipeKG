I substituted rice vinegar for the champagne vinegar. It was easy and though I doubted I wanted to put a vinaigrette on the salmon it seemed to \"clean\" the taste and texture. The sauce was easy and added a nice counterbalance. I kept the preserved lemon measurements the same even though i prepared two pounds of sockeye. Dinner guest worthy.",
