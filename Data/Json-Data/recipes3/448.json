I changed the recipe to make it a little more \"breakfasty\" and the staff said this might have been the best thing I sent in during the 6 years that he has worked there!!  The changes I made were:  putting a layer of blueberry pie filling between the cake layer and the cheese filling, and I decreased the sugar (based on other reviews) to 2/3 cup white sugar.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to the cheese filling and garnished it with lemon zest.  I wish I could have tried a piece but my husband said it was awesome!",

But it wasn't as heavy as I thought it might be considering the ingredients. It also doesn't have that \"cake mix\" taste which surprised me. Paula Deen suggests some interesting variations on this recipe, with pumpkin pie filling added to the cream cheese, or crushed pineapple, or lemon or chocolate or mashed bananas. You can doctor up the cream cheese layer many, many ways.",

The cream cheese which was why I made it was invisible visually and in taste. I saw some in the store and they looked just like mine so I must have done it right. There is cake mix in the recipe and cream cheese but this recipe makes nothing more than a plain crispy very sugary cookie bar. If that is what you are looking for then you might like this.",
