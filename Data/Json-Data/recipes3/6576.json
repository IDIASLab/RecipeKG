        "description": "This is a recipe my Bohemian grandmother used to make for Easter every year.  I was fortunate enough to have learned how to make it before she passed away and my family says I nailed her recipe on the head.  The key: lots of garlic and chives and onions!  Sorry the quantity is so large, but I have no idea how to scale it down much more.  My grandma said 'back in the day' there were a lot of Bohemians in the neighborhood and they would use crates of eggs and make the mixture in the bathtub!",
