The first time I made them was the first time I have ever added cream cheese to deviled eggs.  But you learn something new everyday!  A couple of pluses for me are the ease now in which these can be made, one; is using the Instant Pot for cooking the eggs so those shells just slide right off, the second; is using the cream cheese. I like piping the mixture for a prettier look and the cream cheese gives it body so it can be made ahead and will keep it's shape.  One change I did make to the over all recipe was to omit the garlic entirely, the cream cheese and chive has enough flavor from the onion family.",
