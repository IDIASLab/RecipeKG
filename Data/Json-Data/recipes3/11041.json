                "reviewBody": "I normally don't eat these ingredients together but the picture and the use of the word \"mortadella\" caught my attention. This type of mix is what you will find on most menus in Italian pizzerias.  So being authentic Italian flair, I wanted to try it.  This is a very nice combination of flavors. I don't even particularly care for parmigiano reggiano on pizza but this was quite good. The peppers and mortadella go so nicely together. Who knew? The recipe has a lot of elbow room. There are no amounts so you are free to choose how much of each item - this helps in making it your way. It doesn't state which prosciutto to use, crudo or cotto, so I chose crudo.  It looks like crudo in the original picture anyway.  This is definitely an idea for appetizers at a buffet or party. Small pizzas or foccacce would be nice with this ensemble of salty flavors. Serve with a cold beer and you'll be like the Italians. Thanks for the recipe.",
