I didn't have a whole chicken but collected enough thighs and drumsticks from the freezer to approximate the volume of meat.  I don't keep light beer in the house and I didn't have a lemon so I substituted a traditional amber lager and bottled lemon juice.  The result was a spectacular success and the leftovers were just as tasty. I'll definitely make this again.",
