Yes, well all have different \"to taste\" measurements, but please give a median amount as a starting point; three \"to taste\" ingredients is too many.  I followed the directions, converting the ingredients to match 1 lb of chicken livers.  There's no pretty way of saying that what I ended up with was a liver shake, or a very runny liver mousse.  It was unappetizing to the extreme in appearance, and still has not set up after six hours in the refrigerator.  Because the flavors are so fabulous, I may yet try to salvage this by using some unflavored gelatin.  Just a word to the wise:  even tho the recipe does not say to do so, DRAIN your livers after simmering, and add liquid as needed only.  Next time, I will also use a food processor or a hand-grinder rather than a blender for more control of the texture.  Flavor -- five-star, appearance -- BLECHH.",

I've tried it with the amount of sherry suggested, but that seemed to overpower everything else.  \n\nAs for draining the livers, I didn't - a fair bit of that liquid is melted butter, which sets up nicely when chilled.  The blender does seem to liquefy ingredients easier than my food processor does.  I'd suggest letting the livers cool considerably before mashing, then add that liquid as seems called for.\n\nTotally delicious when served on garlic toast rounds.",

I tweaked a tad bit(eat pate often from gourmet markets in hood) -- I added a teaspoon of Worchester sauce (tang was missing) and used plenty (8-10 grinds) of fresh ground pepper to get the specks of black, let liver cool off about 10 minutes in freezer before blending so mixture does not liquefy when cream cheese is added, and finally when blending in cream cheese also blend in an extra pat of butter (French way)that makes it very creamy and gives more form to the cooled product.
