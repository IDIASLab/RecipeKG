I think if you added some grape tomatoes sliced in half it would add a little more liquid and a slightly different flavor that would push it over the edge to great. I'll definitely try it again with that addition. Thanks for the recipe! ETA: I made this again and added tomatoes. Really perfect. Also I've made it once with broccoli and once with broccolini. My vote is that the broccolini is fine but don't bother going out of your way if you can't easily find it. The broccoli was also quite good. With tomatoes added I'd consider this a 5 star recipe.",

I added 1T. of extra virgin olive oit to the skillet once the pasta was tossed. I didn't have broccolini but using broccoli florets was just fine. I think fresh garlic is the taste key here- although jarred is more convenient the fresh gives the dish the needed zing. I make this weekly now- wonderful!",

I also had to cook the broccolini longer than directions stated...actually I covered with a lid and sort of steamed it for about 5 minutes in addition to the original cook time. If you LOVE garlic--don't be afraid to add even more! Bon appetit! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",
