                "reviewBody": "The chicken Katsu part of this recipe is fabulous...a definite 5 star. But as many others have noted the Tonkatsu sauce was practically inedible. I wonder if the worcester sauce and soy sauce amounts were reversed? Despite the negative reviews I followed the recipe exactly tasted it and agreed whole-heartedly with everyone else. So I doctored it up a bit: added 2 more tablespoons of soy sauce 3 tablespoons of hoisin sauce and put it on the stove to simmer and thicken while I was cooking the chicken. It still wasn't great but it was pretty good even if it didn't really taste like Tonkatsu sauce. So I'll keep looking for a sauce recipe but thanks for the wonderful chicken katsu recipe! ETA: I made this again (really really love this chicken katsu) and tweaked the Tonkatsu sauce recipe and loved it: 1/4 c. ketchup 1/3 c. soy sauce 1/4 c. worchester sauce 1 tbsp hoisin sauce garlic powder and pepper to taste. Hopefully that will help someone because this chicken katsu is really wonderful!",

                "reviewBody": "UPDATE: Ive made this again, and it is crucial that you season the chicken and bread crumbs very well so that the chicken isnt bland, and the tonkatsu sauce needs a lot of tweeking. It is way too tangy with the amount of worshtishere sauce called for, but i decreased it a lot to about only a tbs, and added brown sugar and low sodium soy sauce and the ketchup.  But I would recommend getting the Kikkoman Tonkatsu sauce, maybe that tastes better, I'll keep trying to perfect the sauce! ORIGINAL REVIEW-The chicken was very very good, i seasoned it well with salt and pepper, and I love the way the panko crumbs give it such a great crispiness. As far as the tonkatsu sauce, the worshestire sauce overwhelmed it very much, so i started over and put only 2 tbs of Worshteshire and 1/4 of water, with 2 tbs of brown sugar, ketchup and soy sauce as called for, since the tonkatsu sauces Ive had before were more sweet.",

Definitely pound thin to ensure even cooking and I just seasoned the chicken thighs with salt and pepper before the flour step.  Also the sauce makes way too much and is tart.  Here's my recipe for sweeter tonkatsu sauce: 2 tbsp each of ketchup, worcestshire sauce and soy sauce.  1 tbsp hoisin sauce and add about 2 tsp of white sugar to sweeten it up.  Boil until sauce thickens and use as a dipping sauce.  Overall a lovely recipe.",
