It doesn't make a whole lot so you'll want to double if feeding very many. The other thing is that is takes quite a bit of oil to get the peppers into a paste so plan on that. Lastly it is a bit on the expensive side but well worth it! For kiddo's maybe not but for the adults make this and make it right now!",
