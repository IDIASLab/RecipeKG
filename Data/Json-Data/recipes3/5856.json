                "reviewBody": "This has the potential to be good but I think there's a few things off with the recipe. I think 1/2 cup sesame oil and 1 cup of parmesan is a bit much. So I'd scale the oil down to a few tablespoons and the parmesan to taste. Also 1 hour 30 minutes of cook time for boneless skinless chicken breasts is way too long. Depending on the size of your chicken breasts I'd start checking them after 25 minutes. Also \"marinating\" the chicken breasts isn't necessary. I simply put the oil and seasonings on right before I threw them in the oven. Lastly the recipe never states when to add the parsley so I assume it's at the end for a garnish. Overall I think this needs a little bit more spice maybe different herbs and a little clarity with the instructions. But with adjustments it tasted really good. It would make for a very quick and easy weeknight dinner too.",
