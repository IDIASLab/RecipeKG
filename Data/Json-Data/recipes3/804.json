I made half as directed by the recipe using one cherry per cookie and for the other half I chopped up the cherries and added them to the dough along with a little cherry juice and flour (they were pink and very cute!) Both ways work equally well. However I don't think a 10-oz jar of maraschino cherries is enough especially if you use one cherry per cookie as the recipe directs. I used a 16-oz jar easily. I will definitely make these cookies again perhaps experimenting with almond extract instead of vanilla just for fun! This recipe would be a real beauty on a party platter.",
