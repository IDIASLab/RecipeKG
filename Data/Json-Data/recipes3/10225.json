I used the food processor to chop (pulse) the veges to speed the prep so it turned out more shredded than chunky, which was fine. Also, it didn't say to cover the pot while simmering, so the result was a thick stew that I served over bulgar wheat. I ended up doubling the cayenne and adding 50 percent more ginger (I threw in some freshly grated, as well). I didn't have tomato  juice on hand, so I used a 1:1 tomato sauce/water mixture.  The only coconut I had was frozen shredded (available from Indian markets), so it disappeared into the stew and, sadly, was unnoticeable. Also, there is no need to use  oil to saute the veges because they release enough moisture themselves. Finally, I used Kirkland brand natural smooth peanut butter, which worked beautifully.",
