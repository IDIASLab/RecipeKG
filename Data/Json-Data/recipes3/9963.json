It brought the crispness to a whole new level. Loved it! Looks like I need to re-think the way I have always breaded my tomatoes with next years crop. My tip to you is that you should really invest in a fry daddy if you plan on deep frying anything. Not only do they save time but they save a ton of money in the long run.",
