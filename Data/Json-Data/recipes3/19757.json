It got a lot of compliments but I don't think I will do it again the same way. Sticking all those toothpicks got to be a problem. Also cooking time increases dramatically. I would up broiling them for 5 mintues to cook the bacon (watching the parchment every second). I'm going to do it again with water chestnuts and maybe bell pepper. Just marinate the chicken put it in the pan with the chestnuts and pepper slices cover it with bacon strips and then with chunk pineapple.",

I cut up the chicken marinated it over night then put them together. I cut up sliced pineapple since I had some in my cupboard that needed using up and bought a can of chunks. The slices seemed to fit on toothpick better and were easier to work with. Baked for 20 minutes on a broiler pan then broiled for until the bacon was brown. I will be making this again soon.
