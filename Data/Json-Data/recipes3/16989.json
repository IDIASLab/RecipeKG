If you cook the noodles at the same time there is no need to set aside and wait- just eat!\r\nCC",

I drained the beef/onion mixture of the grease to lower the fat content.  I skipped the flour as it seemed like it would probably be think enough.  Along with the salt, I probably added a half tsp of pepper and a half tsp of garlic powder. When I added the soup, I also added a cup of beef broth and about a tbs of worchestshire.  The leftovers still look thick, so I think I'll add some milk to thin them out.  Thanks for a great start!",

I would rate this 12 stars if I could.  I made a few changes, though.  I cooked 2 1/2 lbs ground beef with 1 chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic, minced. While that simmered, I mixed 3 cans of cream of mushroom with 1 16 oz container of sour cream, 1 can milk, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 1/2 tsp salt in a bowl.  When the ground beef was done, I mixed the sauce in and simmered for 10 - 15 min or so.  I served it over rice.",

I had to add 1 c water and a beef bouillon cube as the sauce was too thick and then added another 1/2 c milk for the same reason. I cooked the meat with 2T dried minced onion plus 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic salt then left the rest of the salt out. I let this cook on simmer/lo for thirty min and it turned very very creamy and had a nice flavor. The extra liquid was necessary though or this is just simply too thick. Nice dish overall after thinning the sauce. I served this over buttered parsley egg noodles. Hubby loved this it's his favorite dish. Thanks this turned out very nice after all.",

I tweeked it a bit after trying the original recipe which was good but I wanted a little more spice. the thing I did was change the beef to sweet Italian sausage (bob evans) added onions and a half tsp minced garlic. Then I omitted the soup because it was too fattening and too salty. I used the sour cream and added flour for thickening. (this worked well). I used the paprika and added a tsp of basil. This was tastier than the original recipe. I omited all the sausage/onion grease except for one tbs. This added additional flavor without the fat. My family ate both recipes and preferred the second version. It was a big hit. I made a caesar salad withh it and dinner was complete.",
