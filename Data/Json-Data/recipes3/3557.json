I followed the directions as they appear but you'll notice there is no time line between once you've added the cheese and let it melt to how quickly you serve it!! My timing was obviously OFF because I ended up with an un-workable glop of cheese. I wonder if adding a bit of corn starch to the shredded cheese (similar to fondue) before adding to the broth would help keep the consistency smooth. As is this is a disappointing mess. I may try it one more time w/ the addition of corn starch and really serve Immediately!",

I always follow a recipe to the letter the first time I make it but I did know what would happen to the cheese so I added just a bit of potato starch to the cheese. I cooked the onions as directed for one hour and they were not tender so I cooked them for another hour. Still ended up with some undercooked onions here and there. I added the cheese a bit at a time and stirred with a fork to break it up and then ended topping it off and putting it under the broiler for just a short time to brown it off. My husband was expecting it to taste like the French onion soup I usually make and even tho he is ok with less intense flavors than I am he thought it was pretty tasteless. He has always said my French onion soup is one of his all time favorites so don't mess with success. Toss this recipe in the trash. I agree. I won't be making it again.",
