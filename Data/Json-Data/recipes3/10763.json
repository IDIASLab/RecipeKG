It's probably the most delicious thing I've ever had! By substituting out the eggs, it's easy to turn this into a vegan meal as well. Try a bite before topping with syrup, it's decadently yummy as-is! I make 'silver dollar' pancakes to take as snacks to potlucks.",

I found this particular recipe to be just OK, but nothing to write home about. I found the texture to be grainy and a bit crumbly. A little xanthan gum probably would've helped. I don't understand why honey would need to be added at all, the pancake syrup you put on afterwards is plenty sweet enough. I followed the recipe to the letter but I would definitely make some changes next time starting with professionally ground oat flour to remove the grainy texture, and I would add xanthan gum to control the crumbliness.  In this day and age with so many people being overweight, having type two diabetes or being pre-diabetic, perhaps substituting a little almond flour to lower the carbohydrates, and I find no need for honey at all.",
