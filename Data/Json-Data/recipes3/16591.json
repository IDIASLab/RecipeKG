I used ham instead of pancetta, Edam cheese for the base, a combination of plain greek yoghurt and cottage cheese with chives instead of feta. To replace the salty flavour of feta I added herbs that would typically be found in Greek food -- oregano, rosemary, parsley, thyme and salt. After all those changes, it tasted great but looked like it was a bit runny, so I beat 3 eggs and stirred them into the mixture before putting on the puff pastry crust. It was amazing, and I was asked for the recipe. Even the fussy kids liked it, despite all the spinach!",
