This taste of this cookie is very similar to shortbread cookies but softer and almost melt in your mouth. I don't know what went wrong with the other reviewer's batch but I doubled the recipe and made these exactly as the recipe calls for and these turned out PERFECT! There are a couple of things you might be tempted to do with this recipe that you have to refrain from doing. Don't make the cookies too large; they will grow and expand while baking. Also you may be tempted to bake these too long because they won't look done but that's the way they are supposed to look. They are NOT supposed to be brown at all. In this particular batch in the photo I used pecans instead of walnuts but they are sumptuous either way.",

There was no need to refrigerate the dough 1t of baking powder is all you need 3/4c of butter and you can substitute the powder sugar in the dough for regular sugar. I subbed the walnuts for crushed pecans and baked the cookies for only 10 minutes. Also don't worry if the dough is too crumbly; the warmth of your hands will keep the dough from spilling through your fingers. They came out just like the premixed cookie gift recipes -that is exactly what I was trying to recreate. Note: This is a very delicate cookie.....Mission Accomplished.",
