The original recipe was more complex, and called for other ingredients like lamb -- which my family won't eat. This version is a big favorite in our home. The yogurt sauce can be as garlicky as your family likes. We usually go for lots, but we've had guests who like it with plain yogurt.",

I've since made it for pot-luck dinners and always get raves. I use a little more lemon over the meat mixture and add more if I reheat. A bit more salt sometimes brings out the flavor too. One of the other reviewers said they found this dish bitter so I was worried -- maybe their cinnamon was old? In any case I didn't find it bitter at all.",

However my husband thought it was ok and ate a full serving of it so I'll be generous and give it 3 stars. For me it wasn't the cinnamon or the lemon. In fact one of my favorite recipes on this site is a cinnamon lime chicken dish so I definitely like the combination of those flavors with meat. I don't know maybe quantities were off. I didn't like this enough to experiment but if these ingredients really appeal to you go ahead and give it a try. Only thing I would definitely change is to use greek yogurt. Thanks anyway for the recipe.",

The cinnamon was odd as I am not used to it but was not too bad. I used some homeade Amish noodles that seemed to add to the dish. I also think I would use regular ground beef and not the lean kind. The meat mixture was a little dry. It was not my favorite but I suppose could become so if I try it a few more times. I also like a large amount of garlic in the yogurt but can see where others might not. It was also odd to mix the hot beef/noodle mixture with the yogurt mixture but again I think it's just something I am not used to. All in all i am glad I tried it and will try it again.",
