I use store bought angel food cake, chocolate fudge sauce, 8 oz. thawed whipped topping, [mix the sauce and whipped topping together in a bowl] and any crunchy candy Plus peanut M&Ms. I put the candy into a baggie and smash it into bits with a jar [spagetti sauce or whatever]. In a seperate baggie I add any nuts I have around, usually almonds, and smash those up or use my nut chopper. I split the cake horizontally in 3 layers, frost with topping mix & candy between layers, frost the sides, inside, & top, crumble candy over all. Last crumble chopped nuts over all.  I have never failed with this dessert, it's always a Big Hit.",

This is so reminiscent of the kinds of dessert recipes that made the rounds during the '70s (like Pistachio Cake Cream Cheese Crescent Squares layered pudding and cream cheese \"tortes \" Banana Split Cake etc. - I've got a million of 'em!). I haven't made this in ages but I relied upon this quick sweet treat many times during those years and it was a hit everywhere it went! I can still picture it and still \"taste\" it in my mind! Don't be put off by its simplicity - this is delicious and angelic looking like a fluffy cloud and can almost be forgiven for its use of Cool Whip which also was all the rage in the '70s! It IS possible to have a beautiful and delicious dessert that's bound to please everybody in just a matter of minutes!",
