But I do use a 4 oz container of the Feta. Also I use red onion sliced, for more color and to sweeten it just a little, add some honey to the Balsamic, to taste.I also slice the cucumbers instead of chopping. If this salad is made in advance, I put the olive oil in last after marinating all the other ingredients in the fridge",

I think its prettier and the onions tend to be sweeter after marinading in the vinegar and oil.  I also made this one day before serving BUT did NOT add the feta until just prior to serving.  This allowed the salad to marinate and take on that wonderful balsamic taste!!  It was awesome and everyone loved it!!  Thank you.",

It's the perfect combination of balsamic, olive oil and fresh basil that makes this an outstanding salad.",

Roma tomatoes have been particularly red and ripe lately in our groceries, and with a plentiful supply of basil in my garden I could eat this healthy, light, flavorful salad every day. I didn't peel the cucumbers, but to prevent excess liquid as the salad sat I seeded both the cucumbers and the tomatoes.  I think with the extra green of the cucumber peel, and getting rid of that not particularly attractive \"guts,\" that it made this salad especially pretty.  The green onion provided just the slightest bit of bite, but not as much as regular onion would, which I appreciated.  This really is a a more delicately flavored salad.  In keeping with that, I used fresh lemon juice rather than balsamic vinegar, which I prefer when I want a lighter dressing.  At the last minute I tossed in some chopped ripe avocado when I remembered I had one and it really added so much creamy contrast in texture.  I loved it.  And I loved this salad.",
