Instead of doing the shrimp in another pan I pushed the vegetables to the side and added the shrimp, garlic and red pepper and sauteed till done, then just stirred it all together. I used sour cream with a bit of lemon juice for the cream cheese and half-and-half in the pasta because I don't care for the flavor of either. I added a bit of Parmesan to the pasta before serving and topped it all with chopped bacon that I removed from the skillet before adding the vegetables. Thank you for sharing!",
