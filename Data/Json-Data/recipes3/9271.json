I found dumping the herbs into the bag already holding the oiled breasts resulted in the herbs mostly sticking to one piece. I then had to get my hands into the bag to spread it around to get even herb distribution, a mess that could have been avoided.  But in spite of this and most importantly, we liked this recipe.",

I did the oil and chicken in the bag but found it difficult to mix the seasoning in the bag with the chicken. So I poured it all into a bowl and mixed it by hand along with the garlic.",

Also let it sit for about a half hour. Then I grilled the chicken breasts on an outdoor propane grill. He gave it five stars himself!
