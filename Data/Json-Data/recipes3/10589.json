I used a cup of noodles, cooked them to just al dente, and once I added the cheese sauce and butter, liberally added salt and pepper:) I also used quite a bit more than a half cup of shredded cheese, as I wanted the browned cheese on top! Overall a pleasant surprise and my husband, 2 year old son, and I really enjoyed it!",
