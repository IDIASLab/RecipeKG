(Costco sells huge packages for about five dollars.) Because mushrooms soak up butter when you saute with it, I did add a couple more tbsp. When I plated it, I sprinkled some fresh grated parmesan over the top of each serving. The flavor of the pasta, the cream, onions and mushrooms was a winning combination. We ate every little bit. I'm SO making this again. My husband calls this \"Snooty Mac and Cheese\". I can only imagine what it would be with the chicken. NOTE: If you plan on making this with the chicken, you might want to make a recipe and a half of the sauce. Without adding the chicken to mine, the sauce was just enough. I'd also add garlic next time.",
