I wasn't able to give the recipe five stars though due to the following errors: If the dough were rolled out to 3/4\" thickness not only would you have a cookie that's 1-1/2\" high when finished there's no way unless each was only about an inch around you'd be able to cut out 60 cookies in order to make 30. I rolled out my dough to about 3/16\" and I got 40 heart shaped cookies 2\" wide at the widest part. Almost all other Spitzbuben recipes say to roll out the dough to 1/4\" (one said 1/8\"). I warmed up about 3/4c. preserves and I had a few of tablespoons leftover. 1/2c. would have been plenty. Minor oops is the typo in the second to last sentence.;0)",

My dough was very crumbly and hard to work with I dont know if it was supposed to be this way or if I did something wrong? The taste was great though. I also didnt know if the cookies were supposed to be golden when taking them out of the oven so I just did 8 minutes (not golden but tasted good) so I guess thats how their supposed to be.",
