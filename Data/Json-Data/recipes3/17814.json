Also, I believe that searing the salmon first acts as a sealant to keep it moist.  I wouldn\u2019t skip this step.  As far as \u201cdirtying a skillet\u201d is concerned, most skillets are oven safe, so flip over that salmon, slather on the Dijon, press on the topping, and shove the whole thing in the oven.  Couldn\u2019t be simpler or more delicious.  Thanks for posting.",

The only change I made was to take the advice of the person who said to forget searing and just put olive oil on the skin side and then just bake. No point in dirtying up a skillet. Everything else was by the recipe. Served with a side of asparagus and dinner salad. This is the kind of meal you get at a 5 star restaurant.",
