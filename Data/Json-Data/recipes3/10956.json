However if you make it as is it will be a little too thick and with 5 habanero peppers it will definitely be too spicy for MOST palates. That said we did make it as is but we added a half cup of water to make more of a sauce consistency and we added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar for a spicy-sweet taste. Add brown sugar 1 tablespoon at a time until you get the consistency you like. Also recipe didn't say to blend at the very end. We did to get a completely smooth sauce. It was delicious!",
