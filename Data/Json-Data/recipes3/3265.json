I beat the eggs and added the chopped onion and pepper and cooked/drained/crumbled sausage (I used hot sausage) plus the bacon bits and a little bit of Picante sauce to give it a kick. I pan fried the egg mixture so it was solid but not fully cooked. Then I used the cream of soup (any of the Campbell's cream soups worked well) as my sauce (only about 1/2-3/4 can was used). I layered the cooked egg mixture with the Cheddar cheese (2 layers of each). Then cooked according to the dough's directions. Each slice was very filling and all the ingredients were mixed together instead of layers of the ingredients. Very delicious. Everyone asks me to make it over and over again.",

And last but in my opinion the winning change... I made my own white sauce as if I were making Cream chip beef on toast. Heres how to do it: Melt 2tbs butter over med high heat add 1 cup of milk and 2 heaping tablespoons flour whisk and cook over med heat until thick. Add salt and pepper to taste.

I halved everything (except the eggs, I used 8) and only made 1 pizza.  I scrambled the eggs, milk, s&p, green pepper, onion and a pinch of jalepeno until it was starting to set but not fully cooked.  I spread a thin layer of cream of mushroom on the crust, followed by a thin layer of hot salsa.  Put the egg mix on top of that and topped it with sliced tomatoes and a sliced pre-cooked sausage link (didn't have any bulk sausage).  Topped all that with cheese and baked about 10 minutes...which I probably could have let it cook a couple more.  I thought it was excellent and my boyfriend loved it as well!",

Put 2 cooked scrambled eggs with 1/2c of saute chopped red peppers & onions on top of tortillas. Added 4 slices of cooked microwave bacon coarsely chopped & topped with shredded Mexican style cheeses. Cooked directly on top oven rack under broiler until cheese is bubbly (watch that it doesn't burn!). This is a great late night snack also. Any topping broiled on a tortilla works great.",
