We used Frank's Red Hot sauce and followed the recipe exactly except we broiled boneless breasts instead of grilling whole pieces. I can't stand vinegary food and with Frank's it wasn't too vinegary at all. Unfortunately it also wasn't very spicy at all it would be a good idea to marinate for a little while. This isn't our favorite recipe ever but it's sure fast and easy and can be part of a healthy quick dinner. It went really well with carrot and celery sticks and ranch dressing.",
