Okay so I'm not a huge lover of Stevia but I was glad to try this recipe. In the past my tastebuds have not take kindly to it. However I used Pyure Stevia and was pleasantly surprised with the taste of this recipe. I think if I were to experiment more I might try something with this combination and adding pumpkin. It just seems like it would be SO right! Anyways I was glad to be able to try this out and see that alternatives are worth trying! I wouldn't binge eat these cookies but I do think the recipe would make a great base recipe for more ideas.",
