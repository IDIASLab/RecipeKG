I used about 8 oz or so of shells (I cooked at 13.5 oz box but didn't need it all; probably used a little more than half just enough to be covered by the sauce). In a skillet I combined 2 cups of homemade pasta sauce (garlic peppers onions tomatoes) with an extra can of diced tomatoes 1/4 cup shredded parm 1 cup edamame (peas would work too) a sprinkling of italian bread crumbs 2 tbs of lemon juice and two cans of tuna plus salt/pepper/crushed red pepper to taste. I simmered for about 10 minutes then combined with the shells and put into the baking dish. Covered with rest of parmasan and some more italian breadcrumbs; baked at 350 for 12 minutes until cheese was melted.",
