However I have never had them with peanuts before...she always mixes in M&M's instead. SO GOOD! Also be sure you let the peanut butter and butterscotch cool just a little before adding in the M&M's or they will melt. The recipe she gave me was 1 12 oz package of butterscotch chips 2/3 cup peanut butter 1 cup M&M's and 3 oz can of chow mein. I buy a little more than 3 oz's and just add until it looks good.:)",
