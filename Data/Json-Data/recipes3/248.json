However the only reason why I am not giving it five stars is because in just reading the ingredients and in tasting as I went along I thought it needed a little sugar in the whipping cream. I added about 3 tablespoons of sugar and it had just enough sweetness to add a little oomph. Also I decorated it with fresh raspberries and cool whip which both offset the richness of the mousse. This recipe will become a standard in my kitchen for those special occasions when you want something a little unique. And it was so easy to make. Thanks!",

Delicious. And decadent. Without question the piece de resistance of tonight's dinner. This is not difficult to make but does require a few extra steps and a couple of extra bowls but oh boy what a pay-off. Creamy velvety smooth fluffy and light as a feather with just the right intensity of chocolate flavor. I made half the recipe and it worked perfectly with a 7\" springform pan. I added two tablespoons of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to the one cup of whipping cream in that half recipe. Curiously according to the recipe a 12-oz. package of ladyfingers should have been used for a half recipe yet the 3-oz. package of ladyfingers I had covered the bottom and sides of the pan exactly. (Come to think of it I've never seen a 12-oz. package of ladyfingers) I plated this with a chocolate syrup drizzle whipped cream and fresh raspberries. I was proud and thrilled to serve this beautiful dessert tonight and hope that with this review (and my posted photos) others will be encouraged to try it too.",

I took the strawberry edging whip cream on top strawberries on top and the crushed Oreo (chocolate cookie) crust. This was the mousse filling. Man was it good! I didn't change the filling at all. Lots of people added sugar to the heavy cream but with the strawberries and whipped cream on top (to which I DID add sugar) it was fabulous. I made it in a 12 inch spring form pan so I increased the ingredients by 50%. This was so good. My father who doesn't usually eat dessert said it was a 5 out of 5. Three of us had two slices. Really good with the strawberries. A light and fluffy mousse that isn't over powering with heaviness.",

It made them hard to integrate to the chocolate mixture. I'm sure the result would have been a lighter mousse had I not done that. It still turned out great though so really it's a great recipe. Just be aware of that. Also I followed someone else's advice to refrigerate in the fridge and then the freezer and I'm glad I did. It was very refreshing. I did 4h in the fridge and 1h in the freezer; next time I'll try 30 min or 1h more in the freezer I think it would be better.",
