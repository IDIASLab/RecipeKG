I also used freshly-ground 4-pepper blend. I used olives from the Italian delicatessen in my neighborhood which happened to be packed with some sun-dried tomatoes and garlic-stuffed green olives so I threw in some of those too. My own adapted version of this recipe looked really beautiful with flecks of red (sun-dried tomatoes) black (olives) and green (fresh herbs and garlic-stuffed green olives) against a pale beige background (chicken breast). I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you Mel Savino for sharing your recipe.",

Used leftover grilled chicken white meat. Also added sweet red pepper chopped jarred cherry peppers and grated cheddar cheese wanted to make it full of veggies and protein. (I would add tomatoes but I was out of those too). Great recipe. The simple seasoning is all it needs.",
