Love frozen chocolate dipped bananas and love these bite sized treats even more with the addition of peanut butter and because they are bite sized. I used a bag of semisweet chocolate chips and did not add shortening once they were melted. I also sub'd the toffee chips out and used crushed peanuts instead. Peanut butter and banana chunks really need to be frozen well to make the next step of dipping in chocolate work well. I didn't measure the peanut butter either and just used my judgment when topping a banana slice. These little frozen bites of delight are rich satisfying and delicious!",

Definitely plan on making these the day before you want to serve them. The part I found most tedious was putting the peanut butter on. I might experiment next time with melting the P.B and freezing the banana slices first, then dipping them in P.B then freezing again, then dipping in chocolate. You could use P.B chips, but it wouldn't be quite the same.\nAll in all this was a hit with my daughter's softball team. The girls devoured a double batch and none were left over.",
