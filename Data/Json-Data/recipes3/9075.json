Amped up spices to 1 tsp curry,  1/2 tsp garam masala,  and nearly tsp salt, few chopped up pickled jalepeno slices, and 6 shakes of red pepper. I doubled flour to 1/2 C and then chilled for several hours. Even after squeezing the zucchini there was still alot of liquid which I poured off after refrigerating. I fried in coconut oil which didn't burn and spatter and cooked evenly. I served with yogurt mixed which freshly chopped mint. Nice side dish and easy.",
