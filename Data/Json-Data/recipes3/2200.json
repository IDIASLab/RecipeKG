The dark grey chocolate-esque look of traditional gumbo and the deep flavor of a roux cannot be duplicated with tomato sauce :)  Keep the file in it, but use a roux as a deep thickeningagent instead of the tomato sauce.  Also add okra :)  NOTE:  DO not add the File powder until the gumbo is done cooking and right before serving. File becomes distasteful when cooked and also doesn't keep well.  Only add it into individual servings right before going to the table.",
