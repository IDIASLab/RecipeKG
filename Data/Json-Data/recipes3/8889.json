Fry up the bacon, remove and drain all the grease from the pan except what clings to the pan.  Add the onions and saute them in the little bit of bacon fat - add the garlic and cook for just a minute or two then add the green beans and the chicken broth.  Use the broth to deglaze the bacon goodness from the bottom of the pan.  Cover and cook until tender.  Plate the green beans and sprinkle with the reserved bacon.   (The juice from the green beans is excellent added to gravy if you are making gravy.)  This way you save the calories from the butter and only mess up one pan.",

In my case, I cooked the beans in boiling water for about five minutes while I sauteed the bacon, onions and garlic.

Brown the bacon, remove bacon, discard all but 2 tablespoons of bacon fat (so would not use the butter in this recipe), saute the onions in the bacon grease and then add the bacon and the rest of the ingredients and cook until the beans are tender.  The bacon grease really does add a sinfully good flavor.  I only do that once or twice a summer.  The rest of the time I make it as this recipe directs using Smart Balance margarine.  It's really a wonderful veggie side dish.",
