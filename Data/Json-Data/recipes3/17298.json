I often just use one onion and about 1/2 cup of milk and 1 cup of flour with seasonings if I just want to use them for one dish. Warning: You may have to make what the original recipe calls for because they are so yummy and you won't be able to stop eating them!",

I was in a super hurry for a quick batch and didnt' have the onion powder or garlic powder, so I made it with just one onion (per the instructions in the intro, above) using only  milk, flour, salt and pepper.
