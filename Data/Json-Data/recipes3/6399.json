I added fresh mushrooms, used only half an onion, an extra 1/2 cup of milk and then mixed the dry bread crumbs with 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese then sprinkled on top. Other reviews noted that it tasted bland so I added 1 tbs of Lowry Seasoning Salt, pinch of garlic powder, pinch of Italian seasoning and a dash of cayenne pepper. I also cooked it in the oven for longer for 30 mins instead of 20 so that the mushrooms and onions could cook all the way through. Besides that the family loved it! Definitely is a keeper :)",
