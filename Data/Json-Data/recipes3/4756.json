Instead of the egg and flour mixture (some comments said it was to thick) I mixed some dijon mustard with some honey and coated the pork chops in that before dipping them in the pecan mixture. I fried lightly in olive oil and then since I don't have an oven proof skillet I moved them to a glass casserole that I sprayed with pam. So delicious! Whole family loved it.",
