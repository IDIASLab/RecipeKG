I also cut the amount of onion to a 1/2 an onion as my family isn't big into onions.  I did squeeze a garlic clove into the butter/onion mix to add a bit more flavor.  This does take a bit of assembly, but is so delicious and easy.  And I love that it only called for regular ingredients that anyone would have on hand (if they are trying to find a recipe to use ground lamb).  My family loved it!",

I cut the recipe in half except for the sauce and the tomoato mixture. For the tomato mix I used one can of Italian stewed tomatoes and 1/2 can of tomato sauce. Since I only used two potatoes the cooking time was cut down by about 45 min. Will make again. Thanks for the great recipe Wendy!",

I used only 1 lb of lamb and 2 potatoes (which I sliced raw and pre-cooked) 1/2 of a 32 oz can of tomatoes. In the sauce I used mixed 3/4 cup 1% miilk and 3/4 cup non-fat half and half (to get richness without cholesterol) and sprinkled some ground nutmeg in. Because of pre-cooking the veggies it only needed 30 minutes uncovered at 375. It turned out yummy even though I forgot garlic! Next time I would drain the tomatoes before adding because it was a bit soggy. And maybe add some feta cheese on top of the meat mixture layer. Tip: Make sure you really drain all the fat and liquid after sauteing the lamb and onion otherwise it would be too fatty and wet!",
