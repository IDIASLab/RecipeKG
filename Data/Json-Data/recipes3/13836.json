The rice turns crispy and crunchy when done right, with just the right amount of spice to keep you going back for more. This is a pretty time-consuming and labor-intensive dish, but after trial and error, as well as a little personal touch, it becomes a delicious weekly addiction.",

Now I did change the procedure a bit because it seemed a little backwards to me and I didn't want to dirty two saucepans and a skillet when just the skillet would suffice. So instead of the order prescribed I cooked the drumsticks in the skillet FIRST removed them then sauteed the onions/chickpeas/rice in the same pan and poured the stock/thyme directly into the pan before adding the chicken back in and popping it into the oven with a lid on it. I did however omit the second addition of salt/pepper/cayenne because I felt 1 teas of each was sufficient and it was still extremely rich and flavorful with just a bit of heat. I served it with a dollop of sour cream to cut the spiciness and it was heaven!",

I added only half of the salt and cayenne like another reviewer suggested. I think the recipe as written would be way too hot. I also deglazed the pan using the chicken broth.   I think next time I will add an extra tbsp of butter, double the thyme, and increase the cooking time in the oven in part 2 for 10 mins to get it extra crisp on top",
