The only reason it did not get a five star rating was due to texture and pumpkin flavor being a bit overpowered by the spices. I modifed the recipe slightly to include 1 packet of unflavored gelatin diluted in 1 cup of boiling water which was then added to the pumpkin mixture for a pie slice that holds together a little better and a 1/4 cup of sugar/splenda to mellow the spices. Excellent pie though! Will make again:).",

I made it on Wednesday to get it out of the way I covered it and refrigerated it just as the recipe directed. When I carried it into the dining room after our Thanksgiving meal and removed the cover with anticipation I was devestated to find a gooey runny mess in the pie crust. We had to dish it up in bowls and plop our cool whip onto what looked like watery sand. The filling tasted okay but it just wasn't pie. This was my first Thanksgiving home from college and my first attempt to prepare a holiday dish for my family and the fact that the recipe doesn't work was quite a let down.",
