This is not like the Americanized version of chili con queso that we have become used to that is a cheese dip, which I also love. This is the way my grandma used to make it. The great thing about this recipe is you can play with it and adjust it to your personal taste. If you like it cheesier add more cheese. You can't mess this up unless you burn it.",

I like things spicy but since I made this for a work function I used pepper jack and my Quesadilla cheese had chiles in it also. It was really good. Will definitely use this idea again. The only thing I wonder is how to make it not so shiny glossy gluey... That is not what I remember from restaurants. In any case very good!",

                "reviewBody": "First let me say for those who tried this and found that the cheese separated and was oily - I think I figured out the problem there. First heat the milk you use to thin the queso don't use cold-from-the-fridge milk. I learned this last year making mashed potatoes and it makes a HUGE difference. I made this recipe twice in 48 hours - the first time I heated the milk and the cheese melted perfectly the second time I used cold milk and the cheese immediately started to look grainy. Second - make sure you don't overheat it this will also cause the cheese to break down and the fat/oil will rise to the surface. Unfortunately I used cold milk AND overcooked the 2nd batch so it was a visual disaster but everyone still loved it. If you have trouble finding Asadero cheese (I couldn't find any) you can use queso fresco but make sure it's not too crumbly. I got mine at a local Mexican market and it was a tad like string cheese so it melted into stretchy creamy goodness with chiles in it. I also threw in a jalapeno with the other veggies for an extra kick.",

                "reviewBody": "Yum! I'm one of those who struggles with getting the cheese to blend into sauces (I'm sure it has something to do with realizing what a good melting temp should be...., at least, I'm pretty sure....). With this recipe, I had the same problem, but this time, I didn't give up.  The flavor of the glumpy mess was too good to give up on, so I simply got out my hand blender wand and gave the mess a whirl.  Sure enough, success!  --- It wasn't quite as smooth as I would have wanted (again, probably a temp issue), but I simply warmed the smoothed out sauce slowly until it became much smoother.  As per the suggestion of the user who used picante instead of veggies, we substituted salsa verde.  Also, in the end, we decided that using extra milk and salsa verde made for a lower fat version of the same thing.  At first, the change seemed a bad idea - after all, we were used to a lot more cheese clinging to our tortillas, but with a second thought, it seemed just fine - more a state of mind than anything, it seems - and from that point we simply enjoyed it.  THEN IT OCCURRED TO US THAT, WITH EXTRA MILK, THIS CLEARLY WOULD MAKE A GREAT CHEESE SAUCE FOR ENCHILADAS...... SUPER YUM!  Thanks for a great recipe, and a clue as to how to alter it into more great things..... Queso asadero rocks!  This German didn't know just how much more meltable it is until now, but I'm sure glad to know now, finally!",
