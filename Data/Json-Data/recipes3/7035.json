The steaks had a wonderful flavor from the marinade and were very juicy and tender. I cooked them medium rare (one medium) and they were perfect. I saut\u00e9ed some button mushrooms in butter, olive oil and onion powder and served a small amount on top of the steak. I would make this recipe again and also use this cut of steak again.",

In my supermarket it's called a Flat Iron steak and comes prepackaged in a cryovac (sp?) package. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly. I think that you need to in order to give an accurate review...is not fair to give a bad or less than complimentary review if you did not use the same ingredients left one or more out or substituted. (You can decide after trying if you want to tweak it to your tastes.) Is not necessary to use an expensive wine...I used a 2.97 bottle of Oak Leaf that I got at Walmart. I also used the fresh herbs and I think I marinaded this for about 6 hours. This was just for my husband and I so the steak I bought was just a little over 1 pound. I still used the same measurements for the marinade and it was perfect. I cut the meat in half because I knew my husband would want his more done....I am a medium rare girl...he doesn't like to see a lot of red. And that brings me to some complaints I saw of this recipe regarding the cooking time. It's difficult to judge that because of the thickness of the steak you buy and the heat you use. I started the burner at medium high about 3 minutes before I added the meat (gas burner). I would say that for my steak it took about 7-8 minutes per side for medium-rare. I left my husband's in the pan for an additional 3 min. per side and it was perfect for him. Excellent meal!",
