I spent 6 months in Germany last year and personally, could live without spaetzle.  This recipe however is better than any I had in Germany or Austria.  I did crisp up some bacon and added the onions to get them nice and caramelized.  I sauteed the spaetzle in the bacon and onion mixture before adding the cheese.  It really was good!  My husband loved it (he grew up in Germany eating tons of spaetzle) as did everybody else, including the kids.  Thanks for the recipe - am making again tonight for an Oktoberfest dinner party!",
