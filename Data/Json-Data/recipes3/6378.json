These are my suggested modifications:\n\nAdd an extra half red pepper and about one to two cups of fresh chopped vine-ripe cherry tomatoes.  To make it healthier - omit the butter and decrease the oil to a teaspoon or so. You really don't need it.  I've tried it with full oil and butter and without -  I can't taste the difference.  Add the grated cheese to the soup and cook for a few more minutes before serving instead of sprinkling it on the top.  I use closer to half a cup of cheese and find the flavor is better.  Also, I like to leave some of the cooked shrimp and veggies aside and only blend about 2/3 of them.  It makes the soup a little chunky and VERY yummy!  Use a sweet onion rather than yellow.  In my opinion, the yellow is too strong and the soup can come out tasting like onion and not much else.  I usually make a double batch of this and freeze it for lunches.  It's a wonderful recipe.  I'm so glad I found it.   \n",

I used green peppers because that's what I had & I pureed it w/ my immersion blender instead of in my countertop blender. I also added another 1/2 tsp of chile sauce. This soup was rich creamy & flavorful but it's not enough for 6 people served as an entree. I got four fairly skimpy bowls out of it. My son who is a very big eater was raiding my fridge after dinner. I served this w/ Pinot Grigio a salad w/ a Honey Pear Vinaigrette flaky croissants & Eggnog Pots de Creme for dessert.

It was super easy to make and was great with the French Bread Rolls to Die For from this site. I used a bit more of the chili oil - maybe it wasn't hot enough because I could only find Thai Sweet Chili Oil. I also couldn't find no fat half and half in my regular grocery store so I used some no fat evaporated milk along with the regular half and half (equal quantities of both). Instead of topping it with parmesan I put a single whole shrimp and sprig of parsley on top. I'll be making this again. Thanks for a keeper!",
