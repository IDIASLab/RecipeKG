I didn't have the fresh thyme, so I used a rounded teaspoon of pesto sauce for each sprig of thyme.  Instead of using 3/4 c of salted pasta water to make the sauce, I used a smaller amount of chicken broth and then simmered it just a little to get it to thicken.  We also didn't think it needed as much Parmesan cheese as the recipe states.",
