So instead of chopping it up where I might have to bite into a piece of it I just placed half a sprig on top of the dish before baking to just perfume the food. DH thouht it was wonderful but next time I'll use bay leaves instead. Also 3 pounds of chicken seemed like a lot so I just used 2 large-ish chicken breasts. Everything else I kept the same. I did reduce the cooking time a bit to keep from over-cooking the chicken. This tasted incredible before I put on the rosemary and it's certainly not the fault of the recipe that I can't stand the stuff. Thank you so much for the post Christyj. I'll be making this again.
