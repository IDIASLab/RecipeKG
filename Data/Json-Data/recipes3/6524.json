I found this very easy to prepare using my food processor to shred the squash and onion. Also I didn't drain it as I wanted the extra flavor from the juice of the shreded onion. I just added a little more flour to make a nice consistency then cooked it like potato pancakes. They were a nice side dish. I'd make them again. Thanks Mottsbela.",

For instance squash is one of those veggies that lends itself to Italian herbs like basil and oregano quite well.",
