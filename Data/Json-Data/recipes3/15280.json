After letting the egg cook a little bit as the pan cooled I felt a little better. My husband tried it first and we'll he liked it. Then I took a taste and it wasn't bad. When I made it I didn't have pancetta so I used bacon instead. I also didn't have the recommended cheese on hand and used some local cheese with the egg mixture. I didn't add the parmesan at the end but instead added salt. I saw another reviewer added onions to the dish which was a great idea (since we love squash with onions anyways) but forgot to add the garlic. It turned out great. The one thing that I didn't like about it was that I had to drain the water from the squash after it's cooked (pre-salting the squash didn't work for me either) but other than that it turned out well.",
