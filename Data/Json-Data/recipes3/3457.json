I made these a few times and to tell you the truth, it needed a little work. :)  As far as them being flat? ANY so-called expert would know it needed a little baking powder.  So, add just about 1/4 tsp. no more!  Also, I know carbs also raise blood sugar. BUT! lol I ditch the skim (yuk) use regular milk or 1/2 and 1/2.  FINALLY!! another trick ANY expert ;) would know... If its bitter and you are using cocoa.. use dutch processed cocoa its not bitter.  Hershey's sells it in the silver container.  If you don't have dutch processed cocoa try a little vanilla.  This was a good recipe.  It just needed an expert :)\r\n",

I also followed what someone had said and for the splenda, I took the measuring cup and put in the smaller box of s/f chocolate pudding mix in there and then finished filling the remainder of the way with the splenda.  I used only evaporated milk and I did use about 1/4 cup more than it called for.  I did not put the topping on and boy, me and my family loved them.  Oh, I didn't use the nuts either.
