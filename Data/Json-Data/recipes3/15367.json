I also used pineapple (my fave!) along with the apples bananas and strawberries then used a single marshmallow on each stick. I also opted to (generously) drizzle the melted chocolate onto the fruit using a fork...made it gorgeous slightly healthier and you could see what fruit you were getting next. Mmm I wonder if a person could toast the marshmallow slightly before threading. I just could not love this treat any more...thanks for sharing!",

I had no apples and only milk chocolate but they still turned out great and actually since the strawberries aren't at their best right now the milk chocolate added a little extra sweetness. The kids just think these are the greatest things...too fun! I will definitely be making these again and again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
