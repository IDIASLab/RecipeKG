I did struggle a bit getting the pastry into the proper size ended up with way too much filling at which point I realized I should have used both sheets. The filling was tasty and if you are good with pastry - would make a nice appetizer although I though they lost a lot once they cooled to room temperature. Much better when hot. It reminds me of one of my favorite recipes which used the very thin sliced pepperidge farm bread cut into circles and fit into buttered muffin tins. You can bake the bread until golden and remove from the cupcake tins you have little tart shells then and you could use this recipe as a filling. I think I would try that next time since I struggled with the pastry dough.",

The dehydrated mushrooms worked surprisingly well I rehydrated them in skim milk then in warm water then dried them and fried them a little in the onion and garlic and oil. I also only used one sheet of puff pastry since I was only cooking for the two of us. I was too lazy to convert the measurements so i just put everything together. I didnt have any shallots so I used onion. I probably used more cream since I like things saucy. I had a lot of extra mushrooms and sauce so I kept it warm and put a little on top of the pastry when it was time to eat. My husband really liked these and even went back and ate some cold ones later. It is a very classy side for a beef or chicken dish. I will definitely be making these again.",
