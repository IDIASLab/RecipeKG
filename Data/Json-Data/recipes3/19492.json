Since we don't like mushrooms I substituted cream of chicken with herbs this was a good choice.  I also cut chicken into strips, seasoned well and cooked on stove.  I then put chicken in the pan and poured the sauce over and baked for 30 min just so flavors could blend.  It could be eaten right away.  I used rigatoni pasta instead of angel.

I added olives, green onions, and mushrooms and used plain cream cheese, doubled the sauce, and served it over penne pasta and fresh broccoli(yummmm, definitely try it with broccoli).  It was one of the best chicken recipes I've ever tasted or made!!  It would also be pretty simple to lower the fat in this recipe.  I'm new to cooking and didn't let the cream cheese soften before putting it in the sauce- definitely a mistake!!  It took more than half an hour to get the sauce smooth, but that was my fault.",

I used an 8 oz pkg of cream cheese 2 cans of soup one packet of Italian dressing mix 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup milk I didn't use butter just mixed the seasoning packet into the soup while it was warming. I also added a can of mushrooms. One full pound of pasta serves 8 so it would be okay to not use a full pound with 6 breasts. I cut my breasts into strips and poured the sauce over and baked for about 40 minutes at 350 perfect. Everyone liked this recipe including me but we must be tough coz the family gave this 4 stars so that is how I rated it as well. We will be making this again.",

Added 1 tsp of minced garlic and 1 8oz package of mushrooms. Sauce was a little thinner that I anticipated but nothing a nice golden roux couldn't correct!. This is a great recipe to make ahead or freeze: Prepare recipe as directed. Transfer to a 13- x 9-inch baking dish and let cool completely. Can be frozen up to three months. Thaw before reheating. To reheat cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake at 325 for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake 15 minutes or until thoroughly heated.

My husband LOVED it, and couldn't stop saying how well it tasted.  I thought it was good, but not 5 star quality.  The chicken was really tender, but the long cooking time seems to take away a lot of the sauce--there didn't seem to be enough.  The second time I made this I added a whole can of chicken broth, which made a BIG difference in the amount it made.",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe.. It is so simple and tasty.   Only changes:  doubled the sauce; used two packages of chicken tenderloins cut into bite sized pieces.  Seasoned the chicken (on both sides) with a little greek seasoning (don't overdo it), garlic powder, and black pepper before placing into the 9x13 pan (prepared with cooking spray).  I sauteed one half of a large sweet onion (sliced thin) in the melted butter in a saucepan until golden, and then added the remaining sauce ingredients.  I used an 8oz tub of cream cheese spread with onion and garlic, not just a block of plain cream cheese.  I've never seen a block of cream cheese with chives, just in the tub containers.   Highly recommend you use GOLDEN mushroom soup to give it the rich color and flavor, not regular Cream of Mushroom soup.  I used the two full packets of \"Zesty\" Italian dressing packets - no need to cut back, we did not find it too salty.  Recommend a good white wine with no chicken broth substitutions.. this is the only way you will truly appreciate the outstanding flavors of the recipe as posted.  I don't think chicken broth would ever yield the best flavor in this recipe.  A good Sauvignon Blanc enhances the flavor of this dish.   For lots of sauce to cover the pasta, I kept it covered with foil for the first 20-30 mins to retain the liquid, then removed the foil for the last half of cooking time.   My family loved this dish and asked that we put it in our family favorites recipe box.",
