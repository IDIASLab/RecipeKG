We would make the suggestion that if you do not have a food processor or manual chopper, then allow yourself at least an hour of prep time for hand chopping everything.  The sun dried tomatoes, if not purchased already sliced/diced, will take a long time to cut.  We used shears to cut them into strips, then cut them again crosswise into diced-size pieces.  We found this to be easier than using a knife.  Also, remove the outer layer or two of leaves on the artichokes; even the canned/jarred hearts can have tough leaves still attached.  We changed the recipe slightly by using only the green portion of 5 green onions and left out the chives (they weren't available) and it was devine. We made additional tubs of spread to give out tomorrow with the Focaccia bread as Christmas gifts for visiting relatives.  Can't wait to see their smiles!  Merry Christmas everyone!",

Turned out GREAT! I modified somewhat...first I halved the recipes, used 3/4 cup cream cheese, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 tsp garlic salt (instead of garlic and salt), 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and a splash of lemon juice. I then spread the mixture on a tortilla wrap, rolled it, wrapped it in plastic wrap, refrigerate overnight and cut into 1 inches pieces the next day. They were delicious!!",

Use artichoke bottoms if you don't like the sometimes tough leaves from artichoke hearts, and use top quality black olives.  Definitely make the night before to allow flavors to meld.  An alternative to serving with crackers would be to use the spread with hothouse (English) cucumber slices for a light snack (great for those on a low carb diet or for those who can't tolerate gluten from the crackers).",

Incredibly easy to make it never fails to draw a crowd of people with crakers -- and it usually draws several requests for the recipe as well. Also a bonus: because I've made this in so many varied locations I haven't always been able to find fresh parsely or chives. Rather then throwing in dry I usually either just left the herbs out or added something of a similar flavor/texture. This recipe is balanced enough not to suffer from the changes.",
