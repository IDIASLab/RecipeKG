This was a perfect combo of flavors IMO. Even hubby who doesn't like 'soggy bread' ate this up and commented on how good it was. A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I used mozzarella instead of fontina and had to use dried basil, also increased the vinegar to 1/4 cup. Will definitely make again using red wine vinegar  which I prefer. Besides, the balsamic turned some of the bread cubes an unattractive brown color. This was sure good, thanks!",

It was good but I made a couple of mistakes that hurt it. For one I made my own bread cubes and cut them too large. I made them about an inch square. If I make this again I'll make the bread cubes about half that size. The other mistake is that I waited too late to add the bread. The bread needs to be added close to serving yes but far enough ahead that the bread has a chance to start soaking up the deliciousness. Once more if I make it again I'll add the bread cubes between 30 minutes and an hour ahead of serving. All that said we really enjoyed the salad and I'd make it again.",
