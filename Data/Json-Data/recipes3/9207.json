It was quick fairly easy and quite different from our normal fare. I had figs on hand that needed using so I was interested in trying something new. The sauce was a bit thick but that could have been my lack of ability to read the tiny directions-without my readers and with a nasty case of poison ivy swelling up my eyes. I added a bit more milk and it was fine. My only other complaint is the picky eaters that I fed this to. I really enjoyed it but they picked out all the prosciutto and left all the figs. At least they didn't totally turn up their noses so I think that's a good sign. I would make this again for me. The rest can make their own dinner.",
