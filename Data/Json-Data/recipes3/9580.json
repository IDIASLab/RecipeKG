Somehow I forgot to put the shallots in before making the glaze, so I added some chicken stock to loosen it up while the shallots cooked and then l let it glaze again. No tangerine juice at the store, so I juiced the orange that I zested. Will definitely put this into our dinner rotation. Thank you for the delicious recipe.",
