The #1 reason that pork is \"dry\" is that you have overcooked it!  Pork should be done to an internal temperative of 160 degrees.  There should be a touch of pink to it.  Sorry, some of you are from the old school of NO PINK IN PORK, but that is just simply not true.  This was an absolutely DELICIOUS recipe.  My teenage son came up from the rec room to inquire what that AMAZING SMELL was!  We ALL loved it!  I'll be making this again and again!  Only substitution I made was using white wine vinegar as I did not have apple cider vinegar on hand.",

I used about a 3 pound pork loin roast and the first thing I did was make a mixture of\r\n1 1/2 Tblsp. fresh rosemary, 1 tsp. garlic salt, 1/2 tsp. dried thyme, and 1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper and put that along with the roast in a plastic bag, shaking it up to coat the roast with the mixture and let in sit in the refrigerator for about an hour or so.  After taking it out again I continued on with this recipe just as written and did also add about a tsp. of caraway, as one other reviewer suggested.  I put it in a smaller pan so that the juices wouldn't evaporate as quickly and when it was done we used the juices as au jus.  IT WAS WONDERFUL!  Great flavor, very moist and tender.  I think the vinegar helps with that.  I served oven roasted vegetables from this website with this, butternut squash, and apple crisp for dessert.  It was a very memorable meal that everyone enjoyed!",

I used balsamic because that was what I had on hand at the time. It was heavenly!!! My 9 year old also loved it. He poured some of the juices over his mashed potatoes and raved about those also. Will definitely fix again...as a matter of fact, I have one in the oven right now. I would recommend monitoring the doneness because it got done faster than the recipe said.",

Anyway the main thing about this recipe is the cooking time. I used a 5 lb boneless pork loin and it was at 170 degrees after 2 hrs! So start watching it at around 2 hours. I hadn't yet put the sourkraut around it yet so had to take the roast out and just bake it by it's self. I also used a great cranberry sauce to spoon over the servings. Take 1 can cranberry sauce plus 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup orange juice and heat on stove until desolved and spoon over meat. Very good. Time to go I am now hungry!",
