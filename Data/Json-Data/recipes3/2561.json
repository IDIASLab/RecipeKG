I think that brining the chop prior to flouring it and cooking it would make it much juicier and give it more flavor. For brining I usually use a warm water solution of salt brown sugar 4-5 cloves of garlic (pressed or minced) and maybe a 1/2 a tablespoon of pepper. This adds a huge amount of flavor to the pork. I highly recommend it.",
