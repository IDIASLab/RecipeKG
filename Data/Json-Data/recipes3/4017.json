We typically make our own cream sauce by whisking 1 tablespoon of butter with 2 tablespoons of flour and then very slowly adding a total of 2 cups of milk until it thickens.  Whisk the flour and butter mixture constantly while adding the milk to reduce lumps. Then simmer it a bit and as it thickens add the tuna, we use two cans drained and then add a can of peas and salt and pepper.  This will always be a favorite of mine.  Thanks for posting.",
