I used a small foil pan lightly sprayed with Pam vs. a foil packet to make things easier. I also used Land O Lakes light butter and I'm sure whatever \"butter spread\" you use it'll turn out good. This was a nice combination of herbs and all I added was a little minced garlic. I opted out of the bacon but I'm sure it would be a nice addition. I covered the pan with foil and these were delicious - perfect accompaniment to grilled chicken!",
