These were crispy, crunchy good, and the parmesan flavor in the breading really shines through.  Instead of marinara, I served with Sun-Dried Tomato Dip, another good recipe on this site.  Always looking for tasty air fryer recipes, and this one will be added to my collection. Thanks, Nikki, for sharing your recipe.",

The zucchini chips  were good and I served them with marinara sauce. By themselves, they were a bit bland since there was only Parmesan and panko. Next time, I will add a some salt and pepper.  I had way more panko mixture than I needed, so will adjust that quantity down or double the amount of zucchini. Perhaps what I think of as a medium zucchini is smaller than the writer\u2019s definition.\n\n11/23/2019 Update:\nI instead of salt and pepper, I used an Italian Seasoning blend.  Since it was the kind you grind fresh, I didn\u2019t measure, I just added enough by sight to the panko and Parmesan.  Also, I used the same panko mixture  on boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and the same Italian seasoning and let it sit for 10 minutes.  I then dipped the chicken in egg and dredged it through the panko mixture to cover.  I cooked them in a pre-heater air fryer at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  I flipped them halfway thru to insure even browning on both sides.",
