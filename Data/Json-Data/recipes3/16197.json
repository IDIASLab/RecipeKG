                "reviewBody": "I have often made this recipe, but I simplify it a little. Instead of cooking the eggs first and putting them on top of the hash, I chop up the bacon and cook it, then add the potato and onion dice to it and cook until beginning to brown. Add the kale if you use it, or indeed any other veg. As well as kale, I like bell peppers of any colour. Then make nests in the cooking hash and carefully crack open and deposit an egg in each one. Cover the pan with a lid, lower the heat and cook for three minutes, or as long as you prefer. A yummy brunch or supper dish!",
