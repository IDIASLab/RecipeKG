This is more of a pastry.  It is very sweet, so if you're diabetic, be very careful.  This a a true Philly dessert.  The cake mix does not \"pour\" like others may think.  It is a crust base and must be formed into the pan.  If you have any experience making cakes or pies, you should be OK with this.  It is very easy to make if you know what you're doing.",
