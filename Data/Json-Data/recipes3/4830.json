If anyone wants to try this and has never worked with real vanilla before: Cut the bean in half and store the remaining half; cut away the tip of the other end; using a small paring knife insert the tip of the knife blade-up into either end of the bean and slice along the flat side (this motion should be slow and careful to avoid cutting yourself); using the knife carefully open the split seam using one finger to hold open the section closest to you; using the sharp end of the blade scrape away all of the tiny seeds within the open bean (they are smaller than a grain of sand); repeat the last step as many times as necessary to remove all the tiny seeds turning the bean around to get at the seeds where you hold the bean open; the seeds AND bean all go into the port base to simmer with the rest of the ingredients.",

I canned the figs using a water bath method. They were firm and plump and turned out deliciously. If you are into figs this is truly a winner. I added the cream and honey later after opening each jar. Lovely presentation. I think using a vanilla bean is a great addition too.",
