To the cook who tried to use the Panko, Panko is a very delicate bread crumb, much different than Matzo in consistency.  Whenever you use Panko, always use tempura batter with it. Please do not give negative comments if you don't follow the recipe the way the original cook intended it. Thanks for the recipe, my 4 year old loved it.  ",
