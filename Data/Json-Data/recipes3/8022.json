I used white wine vinegar. I thought the onion and the vinegar flavor over whelmed the taste of the tomato and the cucumber but over all it was pretty good. I think this would work better as a part of a larger salad involving some lettuce and grilled chicken to round out a meal. After the flavors meld and the juices start to come out there is a great dressing that shouldn't go to waste!",
