In doing so I cut the molasses back. Using both onion and green onions seemed like overkill and I love onions. The onions really were not the problem though. Something happened in the fridge overnight. Instead of the alcohol and other ingredients tenderizing the chicken it became tough once grilled and no it wasn't overcooked. The flavor might have been okay but the texture was bad. Sorry but I won't ever try this again.",

It's hard to mess up chicken marinade. Really hard. This thoroughly succeeds. I make wonderful jerk chicken (some similar ingredients / flavor profile) with my time-tested recipe and I thought this would be a variation of sorts lending a little variety. It was AWFUL! One of my 6 kids said it was \"ok\". The rest of us wouldn't even eat it. We like rum and I used a fraction of what the recipe called for because I knew that could be a strong component. It was all you could taste. We love the ginger lime hot pepper green onion spice combo - not our first time around the marinade block - the only ingredients in question here were the molasses (which we like) and the rum (which I cut way down). For whatever reason it was horrible. If you care about chicken if you care about your family... for love of marinade... run for your life!",
