I think a half cup each of onions mushrooms tomatoes bell peppers and bacon is a HUGE amount for a mere four eggs! I would recommend the additions of each of these ingredients to taste. I took a big-time short cut on this however so other than the bacon I didn t have to be concerned about chopping and measuring anything. I made extras of Personal Portobello Pizza last night expressly for this purpose and I was grateful for the ease in which it allowed me to get breakfast on the table this morning with a minimum of fuss or muss. A mess this Aussie Breakfast Egg Mess is but this mess sure was good. Still because I believe 2-1/2 cups of add-ins to be extraordinarily heavy-handed for just four eggs I can only rate this 3-stars.",
