Texas Roadhouse quality! (Which IMHO, is amazing) The Dr Pepper definitely took this thing the extra mile over root beer. I used 4lbs of tenderloin and didn't change the recipe. Worked perfectly! I did brown the outsides of the tenderloin on the saute setting with olive oil in the IP before pressure cooking. I will definitely be making this again! Move over chicken, pork is the new staple in our house!",
