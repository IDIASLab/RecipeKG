If you like sweet and spicy add some ground cayenne pepper. This entire recipe I added the ingredients to taste so I had to keep adding this and that until I thought it was perfect. I added some red food coloring to make it look more appetizing. Also before I added to the chicken before baking I took the sauce and simmered it on the stove to just as you would if you were making preserves. It was so great my picky eaters ate it up quick. After experimenting on my family I gave some to my next door neighbors and they loved it. I served it with stir fry veggies and jasmine rice.",

I also could not find the juice suggested so I used a tropical blend from bi-lo with carrot and fruit juices in it. The juice was great. I'd definately peel the plums next time and leave the peelings out. I will also be dumping ALL of the fruit mixture on the uncooked chicken. I found I liked the taste of the fruit better when cooked into a glaze on the hot chicken. I also left out the pepper flakes.. I might try those next time. I served this with lightly buttered rice and sweet corn.",

I thought I had peaches but had nectarines so I used a nectarine. I didn't have the vegetable juice drink so I subbed 1/8 cup Fresca (because it sounded like the sauce was thin in the original recipe) and after tasting added more red pepper flakes. The grapefruit taste in the Fresca made this fabulous. I cooked the chicken on the stovetop browning and then adding the sauce. Served with white rice. Very good. Thanks Don for suggesting this!",
