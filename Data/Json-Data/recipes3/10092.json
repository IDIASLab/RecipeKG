The bread had great flavor and I made 'The Best Caesar Salad Dressing' from AR to use on this. DH informed me we could have this 'quite often' this summer as we do grill romaine a lot. Served this with grilled pork loin and homemade mac n' cheese. This salad was our favorite part of the meal. Thank you!",

I had left over steak which I slivered up and added to the top of the salad. Lastly I closed the lid of the grill and let the steak warm slightly and Parmesan petals soften. I drizzled each piece with remaining dressing. Fabulous!",
