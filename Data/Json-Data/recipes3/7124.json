Added some italian seasonings, cayenne pepper (trying to kick this sore throat), and various veggies that included mushrooms, canned green beans, edamame, canned corn, carrots, onions, celery, zucchini and some red peppers.  I also had to thin it out a bit with a can of veggie broth.  YUM. It made a lot of soup, but thank goodness it's not too hot yet to still eat it.  FYI--cayenne pepper was only a pinch, it adds a kick to it but helps cures sore throats!",
