I also did not follow the amounts of ingredients 100% but it still turned out fantastic so it is pretty much fool proof. Instead of large tomatoes I used 4 roma tomatoes seeded for one pizza and fresh basil from my garden. I also did not include mushrooms since I did not have any on hand and I left out the jalapeno. I used a yellow onion instead of a red onion. My husband and I devoured it and he said he loved it more than the pepperoni pizzas we always make at home. Can't wait to make it again. Thank you so much for this simple recipe.",

I left out the jalapeno mushrooms onion and olives as a personal preference plus my husband isn't a huge fan of a bunch of stuff on a pizza. And I really just wanted the fresh tomato and basil to shine through. For the pizza sauce I used \"Pasta/Pizza Sauce\" from this site. I layered my sauce cheeses fresh basil & tomatoes then drizzled a bit of olive oil over top. It baked up beautifully and tasted great - especially with a nice glass of wine!",
