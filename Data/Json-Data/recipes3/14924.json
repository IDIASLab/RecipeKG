REAL wings use only equal parts of Frank's Hot Sauce (no substitites allowed) and butter for mild sauce. That's it - just Franks and butter. To make them hotter increase the amount of Franks. This is how the best pizzarias make them in Buffalo and for the record Anchor Bar has good wings but not the BEST wings in Buffalo - there are plenty of neighborhood pizzarias and bars that make way better wings!! And you coat the wings by swirling them around in a metal mixing bowl with plenty of sauce after they have been fried - and in Buffalo they are NEVER NEVER served with ranch dressing - REAL Buffalo wings are served with Blue cheese dressing and celery!!!!",

Much better than using an entire gallon of peanut oil and this got the wings good and crispy. For the sauce I added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes which for me left the wings fairly spicy. This isn't a traditional Buffalo Wing sauce but is still really good. I liked the garlic flavor in addition to the heat from the red pepper flakes Frank's RedHot and black pepper. I will definitely make these again.",

If you really watched the video and read Scotts notes you could comprehend better. He stated the Anchor bar started the wings not the best, he plated with celery and blue cheese not ranch as you claimed. Review the facts and please watch the video again, clearly you missed it meaning you probably didn't follow directions. As you know this is a recipe site however he makes his wings is HIS way. Don't like it just say that and move on.  Scott my daughter loved your wings and thank you for sharing!",
