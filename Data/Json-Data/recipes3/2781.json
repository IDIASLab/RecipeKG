I've tried this 3 times now just to make sure I was doing it right but every time it has bombed. I think it was really a matter of preferences when it comes to vegetables too. My family generally likes their vegetables steamed and with little seasoning. The green bean flavor with the garlic and parmesan just didn't work. My grandmother even said \"What's wrong with these beans? They taste funny.\" I really tried to make this one work especially given all the great reviews. Try it for yourself though. I think this will probably appeal more to those who normally don't like beans unlike my family...who grows about 5 different varieties in the backyard.:D",
