The recipe was cut back by half and I made the following changes: I finely diced a small onion and roughly chopped 4 oz. of cremini mushrooms. This combo was cooked in the oil until the onions softened and the mushrooms browned about 5 minutes. The herbs were then add until fragrant. I garnished the dish with fresh chopped parsley. Thanks for the recipe.",
