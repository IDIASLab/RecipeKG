You can maximize this recipe per your tastes; I did 2 versions tonight.  1st: the \"sweet\" version with syrup: can't afford pure maple syrup and don't like it. Used the store-brand stuff, reduced it to a near toffee consistency, then added the roasted swt. pot. and onions and bacon. The result was like taffy....chewy, sweet, and beyond flavorful.  The 2nd version I did simply omitted the syrup: just the baked swt. pot., smoked bacon and carmelized onions. You know what MAKES this recipe? the thyme. I didn't have fresh; used ground I had on hand (a probable amount and then some) and it gave a wonderful punch and savory=ness to the taste. A great balance to the sweet. (Do add s/p to taste)",

Changes I Made:  For four people I used 1/2 lb sweet potatoes, 1/2 lb baby carrots, 1/2 a large onion, 1-1/2 slices of center cut bacon, only 1 tsp of olive oil (more than enough), and 2 T of lite syrup, plus 3/4 tsp thyme.

Since I did not have the bacon grease I used a tablespoon of olive oil to saute the onions. Used a combination of 0.75 cup of the pure maple syrup and 0.5 cup diced canned pineapple and reduced that to half volume. The thyme was not something I thought I would like but it definitely works well here. I used 0.5 teaspoon of dry thyme. Another great surprise was how good the potatoes tasted after the roasting before adding the glaze. Served it to 12 picky women and they all want the recipe!",
