This was excellent! Made this recipe exactly as presented (which is why the 5 stars - I can't stand it when I see 5 star reviews, but only 'if' you do this, that, or the other thing). Absolutely no changes needed. I saw the reviews that said to cook longer, but I think that depends on how small you chop the kale, and of course remember to get rid of the stem, all the way up through the middle of the leaves, especially the big ones. If you do that, the 15 minutes of cook time (10 at simmer) should be plenty.",
