So I changed a few things because of what I had on hand, I had planned to use a different recipe, so already had a can of coconut milk open, then found this instant pot recipe and thought I would try instead, I used 14 ounces. Of tomato sauce from my garden, the can of coconut milk, and half of a dried Serrano pepper from my garden (didn\u2019t have Indian chili pepper on hand. I wasn\u2019t sure how it would be with the coconut milk, but it was plenty of spice. My one question is this\u2026..my instant pot doesn\u2019t have a \u201cpoultry function\u201d, so I put it on Pressure cook low (it started to burn, so I turned off immediately, and tried \u201cmeat/stew\u201d\u2026.same thing. I ended up just pulling it off and it was done enough, although likely not quite as tender.  I like the ease of the instant pot. *fortunately I caught each time before it actually burned, so no burned taste.",
