We made it exactly as called for with the optional capers. In the end it was just too lemony a bite of the spaghetti without Brussels Sprouts was just too tangy and the mellowness of the tahini was hard to find. The juice of the medium sized lemon I used produced 1/4 cup. In the future I will try to make this using a maximum of 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice and see if I'd like to ramp it up from there. I also would at least halve the Brussel Sprouts and quarter them if they are large. I also had to prepare a little corn starch and water to thicken up the sauce which was not a problem at all. All the cook times were very accurate.",
