I used a whole can of olives (20 was about half a can) and instead of dumping 1/2 cup of cheese into the salad I grated a small amount over each serving (more would have been too rich for me). Because I didn't use as much cheese I added more salt. I think this would probably be best tossed with greens--especially arugula. Next time I'll add a few more capers. I'll probably use the dressing for other salads as well. UPDATE: I made this again and increased the capers used only 1 lime omitted the cheese and tossed it with arugula. Even better! I think the biggest difference was reducing the lime juice--much less puckering and the salad didn't seem as sweet.",
