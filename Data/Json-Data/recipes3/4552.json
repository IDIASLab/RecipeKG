I made this as a side dish for our ribeye steaks last night, as written for the ingredients, but added one extra step at the end... it came out of the dark, well-greased pan with a soggy bottom, and I still had the fat from frying the salt pork in the frying pan.  I heated it up and fried squares of the potato cake until they were crisp on the bottom, just a couple of minutes.  THESE WERE EXCELLENT!  Crisp on the exterior, CREAMY interior, with a hint of onion and the salty pork!  I served with salt, pepper and a dollop of sour cream.  DELICIOUS! Today, I called my 100% Lith mom and described them to her.   She said that her mom used to make them, called \"Koshie\", and they often left out the salt pork so that they could be their Friday (meat-free)meal. They also had them often during Lent.  What I described to her was exactly what she remembered from her childhood!  FIVE STARS!!  Thank you... I will be making these creamy, delicious potatoes often!  (Mom says the leftovers are good crisply fried for breakfast the next day!)",

Very very hard work but the texture would be devine. Also make sure to squeeze the water out of the potatoes by putting them in cheese cloth and squeezing. She didn't use salt pork but good pork chops diced very small.",
