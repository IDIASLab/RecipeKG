So I mixed them together and I was able to achieve a good flavor. I used a red wine vinegar since that s what I had. The base of the soup was very good. Being a non-vegan the vegan cheese was unpleasant. I m sure that if you are used to eating vegan cheese that this wouldn t be a problem. I would make this again and use the cheese normally used in French onion soup...but I will also suggest this as a good soup to my Vegan friends.",
