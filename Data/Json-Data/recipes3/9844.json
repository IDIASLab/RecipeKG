I made this chili following the recipe exactly and I do think that the proportions need to be changed a little. If I make this again I would use a full pound of meat and not use the second can of tomato juice and also use just a half cup of pickle juice. I thought there was too much liquid to not enough meat. Nothing big and things that would be so easy to change if I make this again. Thank you for the recipe fluffersd!",
