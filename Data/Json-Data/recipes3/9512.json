You can also add a quick fresh pico de gallo to this if your diet allows tomatoes. Delicious! I now enjoy this more than regular fish tacos. Try this also with halibut or tilapia.",

I lost patience trying to peel the cabbage leaves, I only got about 6 of them and gave up! So I diced up the cabbage and mixed it with the wasabi mayo and served it kinda like a coleslaw. So good!! Thank you thank you! :D",
