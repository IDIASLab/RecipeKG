I had no dry cake mix left on top.  I had just a couple of tbsp. shy of the 1 cup butter.  I cut the slices of butter into pats and placed them over the entire cake trying not to leave too many gaps.  It worked perfectly.  I only had about 1/3 cup coconut which was fine since so many reviews of dump cakes on this site state that there was too much dry ingredients and not enough wet.  This was perfect.  I whipped up some cream to put on top and my coworkers loved this cobbler-like dessert.  I was leary of using a bundt pan so I put it in a 9x13 sprayed with pam and it worked fine.",

Turned out absolutley perfect!!",
