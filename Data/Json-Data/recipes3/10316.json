After cooking the bacon in the big pot I removed it and added my chopped veggies(not potatoes) and butter to the meat drippings. May have added some of the clam juice to help. Softened those then added not quite a cup of flour and cooked a min or two stirring the whole time. Then The rest of the clam juice plus another bottle while stirring and bring to a simmer til thickened. Added the milk and creams, seasonings, bacon and potatoes and let sit a bit. Then at last the clams and a pinch of sugar! Was pretty good but a day or 2 later reheated it was amazing! I would highly recommend making it the day before for a make ahead meal! I did not use spinach and would also add more clams next time.",

I ended up adding: white wine, about a cup. Water, a cup, and Fresh garlic made a huge difference. Quite a bit more salt than I expected to need, but might have been fault of my clam juice, personal preference. How much bacon grease? Who cooks only 4 pieces of bacon to only have that much fat? I guessed, maybe 1/4 cup eventually. Flavor, bc it was FLAT like playdoh. Just not good as is to me. I was stressed I just wasted so much food making it but I redeemed it with added items. I\u2019d half this for two people. Very filling, way too much food for two even w leftovers. Not good enough that I want to eat it a lot. Wish it was. Still looking for a great chowder. I\u2019d figure out how to begin with thinner cream base. It\u2019s very very thick. Maybe too much flour.",
