Having said that you could bake or griddle fry these instead of deep frying. The value is using an under-appreciated vegetable that most people turn up their noses at. The nutritional information wasn't that bad for the recipe and was only 1.5 grams higher in fat than the Moroccan Vegetable Soup( with parsnips) and.6 grams higher in total carbs than the same soup. For me its the carbs that make or brake a recipe being diabetic.",

I switched skillets half way through and the difference was like night and day. Also these patties even when done are a bit on the soft side when hot and you'll need to be careful when flipping and removing them from the skillet. They do stiffen up as they cool however.",
