I used shredded cheese instead slices as that I'd what I had on hand as well as sprinkled a bit of nutmeg into the custard base. I served it with a raspberry and maple coulis for dipping. To make it a more authentic Monte Cristo I may top the ham with deli turkey as well. But this was fantastic thanks Piques for sharing this recipe!",
