Love the different flavors and textures and also think this would work well with marinated artichokes and just about any other veggie/herb you can think of. This will definitely be part of our dinner rotation-yum! Thanks for sharing",

I probably added a few more sun-dried tomatoes than it called for but that's just because I love them. Ha.  I added some feta cheese on one serving and that was great, too.  You could probably add some parsley or some other garnish but this was great on its own for a light, vegetarian lunch.  I'm thinking the leftovers will be good cold, as well, which means it will make some more lunches through this week.  Easy dish that is a departure from my norm so thanks for getting me out of my culinary rut!",
