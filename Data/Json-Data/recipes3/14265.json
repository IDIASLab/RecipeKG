I thought the black pepper was going to be overpowering but it wasn't at all. Not sure if it was the brandy and cream or what but the sauce had an espresso taste about it that worked perfectly with the peppered steak. Hubs gave this two thumbs up and mentioned it several times throughout the rest of the evening. Definite keeper!",
