I also added salt and pepper, had low fat mayo and full fat yogurt.  I only had a tangerine so used the juice from that and also a bit of the grated rind thrown in.  It really brought out a beautiful flavor and the color of bits of orange.  I didn't have sunflower seeds so threw in a few cashews for crunch.  The textures are also wonderful in this salad and so healthy.  Will definitely be a summer staple in my house.  It was nice to find one that didn't take bacon, as my husband doesn't eat pork.",

Didn't like it much when I first prepared it but after sitting overnight it's delicious!  The flavors have really blended.  I think it would be good with chopped walnuts instead of the sunflower seeds.  That would even make it healthier.  Will definitely make again!",
