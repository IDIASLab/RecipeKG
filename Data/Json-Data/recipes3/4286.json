Steaming is a gentler way of cooking and it makes it harder to overcook which you don't want to do. Put some fresh bay leaves and the peel of 2 lemons in the water your steaming over. Cover and cook for several minutes stirring often. Dress the calamari when it's still hot then chill so flavors meld. Remove from fridge alittle before you eat it and re-toss in dressing.",

I added about a quarter of a red onion, chopped finely and I also added a small portion of shredded napa cabbage.  I added the napa cabbage because that is what one of our local restaurants does with their calamari salad.  I would highly recommend this recipe!",
