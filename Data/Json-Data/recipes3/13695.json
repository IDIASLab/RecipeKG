You will want to use a small casserole dish if made as written. I ve made this recipe many times and use an 11 x 8 oval casserole dish. It takes 9 or 10 large poblano peppers. I also use 2lbs of ground beef and slightly heap the tablespoon/teaspoon when measuring. I don t measure the cheese but can say with certainty that I use more than stated in the recipe. I like to cook the ground beef first and drain off the fat. Then I proceed with adding the onions seasonings and tomatoes. I will drain off all of the liquid again before layering in the casserole dish. If you don t you will end up with a watery casserole. In my opinion poblano peppers are the hardest to roast and peel. I find it is easier to roast the peppers whole then cut in half and remove the seeds. Either way is messy. It is worth the effort.",
