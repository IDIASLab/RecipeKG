The kitchen was warm and so were my hands - without the freezing, the balls were too mushy to really dip. 2.  Use toothpicks to dip the balls in the chocolate (which I had no probs with).  This creates a small pinprick size hole at the top, which I covered with a small dot of chocolate - the perfect topper!  Everyone loves these - they are disappearing out of the freezer before the holidays even begin!",

After reading a lot of the reviews I figured I would add a little tip: Instead of shortening I use 1 stick of household parafin wax mixed with 1 bag of chocolate chips in a double boiler for the coating. The wax helps the chocolate set quicker and harder and makes for a nice sheen. It also thins the chocolate to make it easier to dip the balls. Also if your peanut butter is too thin or melty just keep adding more confectioners sugar until the dough is stiff enough to work with. We make peanut butter balls similar to these every year (never tried it with the graham cracker though may have to try that this year!)and we love them! It's a must have every year!!",

Also use the freezer to help keep the balls solid both before and after you've dipped them in the chocolate. It takes time but WELL worth it!!!",
