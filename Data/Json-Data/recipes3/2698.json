We rushed out and when when we got back I stepped on something squishy it was a piece of pasta on the floor. In our rush out of the house I had left the leftovers on the counter and my dog had decided that was her dinner. She ate all of it with the exception of a tomato or 2. Now whenever I make it she comes into the kitchen and wags her tail and expects to eat with us.",
