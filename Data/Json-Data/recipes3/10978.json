I still felt like there were too many onions for how much squash and tomatoes there were but maybe that is only the opinion of someone who feels the way I do about that ingredient! I also think more squash is needed to match up to how much tomatoes and sauce there are. If I were to make this again I would use 2 squashes instead of just one (and then also a bigger pan to fit it too!) I have some leftovers in the fridge that I am planning on mixing with some pasta as I think the flavors would go great as a kind of pasta sauce.",
