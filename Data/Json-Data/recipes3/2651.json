Also I think maybe it should get baked for longer. I followed directions but perhaps I should've used the full ten potatoes and crammed them into the pan and not boiled them for so long because I ended up tossing this whole dish. But like I said it's probably user error. Everybody else that rated loved them so when making this recipe don't make the same mistakes I did.",

Changed my rating from 4 to 3 stars as for 1 extra gram of fat they are worlds better (a most solid 5). These are good & acceptable as healthier than most & don't need butter but the other recipe just shines in comparison. Also I doubt the difference in fiber counts one recipe to the other. I left skins on on the Yukons so would have more anyway. Still impressed as DH hates cottage cheese saw it & still liked it! Don't expect to be liked mashed texture is different. With these I used about 1/4 cup onion somehow forgot the garlic powder (think would use fresh anyway). Sprinkled very little less fat cheddar on top for color. To save time cooked potatoes (whole) day before & grated next day (seemed would grate easier). The cayenne is key. Thanks Mary & sorry for changes.",
