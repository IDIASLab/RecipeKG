At first the sauce went on the bagel slices very easy. At the end it was clumpy and would not spread evenly so added more oil. Baked for 10 minutes. Next time we will use any old bread/bagels and tear into pieces and drop directly into bowl of sauce to coat then bake and use in salads. These had a good flavor but not real strong. Will also add more garlic and maybe a pinch of salt next time.",
