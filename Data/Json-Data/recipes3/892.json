After being refrigerated it is nearly impossible to spoon out of the pan since the cheese hardens when it cools and it doesn't reheat well all the cheese sinks to the bottom of the pan leaving oily pasta at the top. My son loves mac and cheese and I like to make a lot for dinner and reheat it for his lunch the next day a no-go with this recipe he won't eat it. I do continue to use this recipe but I only make half so as to avoid waste.",
