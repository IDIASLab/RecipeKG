I just don't like the sensation of biting into one. The worst part is that I'm a vegetarian! Anyway this recipe looked so good I decided to reassess my feelings about beans. Well I still don't like the texture. But! I threw the batch into the blender with some lemon juice more garlic and garlic powder and tahini to make hummus which turn out to be just delicious. So I say that although I changed the consistency a little this dish is superb and only crazy bean-fearing folks would ever hold anything against it:)",

Some ideas would be to add an additional type of pepper--maybe a hotter one or just green pepper? I prefer only a hint of oregano flavor so a pinch was more than enough. One other option might be to add some minced garlic in the skillet with the onions and pepper. As is the recipe is a winner and tasty. Have fun trying different spice blends geared towards your tastes. I did pack the extras in my lunch the next day and it reheats up very well in the microwave which is an additional bonus!

I followed the recipe as written and the only addition I made was to dress it with a little drizzle of extra virgin olive oil which made it a little more moist and added a little more depth of flavor. I served it over hot pasta with some Parmesan. Delicioso!  (I suppose if you want to punch it up a bit, some fresh or canned roma tomatoes would fit in nicely as well.)",
