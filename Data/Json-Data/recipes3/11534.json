If you've never had a steak or chicken salad with fries on it you are definitely missing out and you MUST try it...SOOOOO GOOD! We use either Italian or ranch (sometimes both) for dressing YUM!!!!!

Sometimes they use flank steak or London broil cut in thin strips and also add carrots and diced onion. Just make sure to keep the fries and steak warm so the cheese melts when you spread it on top. I like Sweet and Sour salad dressing on mine, but the hubs likes any type of Italian. Thanks for posting the recipe!!!",
