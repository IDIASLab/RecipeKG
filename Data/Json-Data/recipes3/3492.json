I switched to olive oil and used 1 tsp paprika (my teaspoons are always heaping!) 1 tsp garlic powder 2 tbsp romano cheese (instead of Parmesan) and 1 tsp. cayenne pepper along with the salt and pepper. Once tossed I put the potatoe wedges on a baking sheet and baked at 400 degrees for 30-40 min. Thanks for the great recipe!",
