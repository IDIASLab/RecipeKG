I steamed the cauliflower in a steamer basket until just just tender but not falling apart and then set aside to cool a bit. I mixed up the full amount of mayonnaise and curry power and painted the entire surface with that mixture setting aside the rest for dipping sauce. Baked for 8 minutes without the cheese and then added the cheese and set the oven to broil for two minutes until the cheese was melted and formed a crust. It made a very pretty presentation. Nice thing is this can be made ahead to the point of the final bake / broil. Thanks for an inspiring recipe.",

The flavor is perfect but it's a little messy to serve. The cheese forms a \"crust\" over top so when you try to cut the florets apart the crust is hard to cut through and ends up coming off in one big piece. No biggie maybe I just need to adjust cooking time.",

I didn't have curry in my seasoning supply so I used the Mild Curry Powder recipe from this site. It worked great. Since I was cooking this for just myself I decided against using the whole head of cauliflower. I cut the florets apart which were quite large themselves and boiled about six of them. I wanted to follow the recipe as is but I would have preferred to steam them. For the cheese I just shredded some sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses and combined them. While I enjoyed the chance to try something different I'm not convinced I'm a curry fan. Loved the ease of this recipe.",
