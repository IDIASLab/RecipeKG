The yogurt is a lovely sharp change from the standard heavy cream. If using a rice cooker there's no need to cook the haddock: just steam it on top of the cooked rice on the Warm cycle then flake it with chopsticks right where it lies. I cook the rice in fish or chicken stock for added flavour and always make enough for leftovers: kedgeree is the BEST omelette filling imaginable.",

Then I added the bay leaf to the rice while it was cooking and added a touch of coconut milk (my standard sub for cream/milk) to the rice after it was cooked. I seasoned it with quite a bit of salt but it was really the yogurt (I used Greek) that brought out the flavors. Easy and delicious--a definite keeper!",

My quandry was that I'm trying to take off a few pounds and can't afford a white sauce....and here my mom gave me this smoked haddock. I used brown basmati rice (Trader Joe's) and scaled the rice down to just two cups cooked rice. Used olive oil instead of butter...just because. I'll make this one again.",
