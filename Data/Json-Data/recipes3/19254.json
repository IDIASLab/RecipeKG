I covered the pan with foil for the whole cooking time. The meat was tender and the sauce had a good teriyaki flavor without any orange taste. There was a lot of extra sauce which was used for dipping and rice but still might cut down sauce ingredients next time.",

The sauce was a little thin but this may have been due to the light soy sauce. I ended up pouring the sauce through a strainer (like you would gravy) into a sauce pot and then thickened it with 2 Tbsp corn starch and water. The result was a terrific orange sauce/glaze that I poured over the breasts. I also made rice pilaf on the side and the sauce tasted really good with it. Next time I might try adding some orange zest to the sauce. Overall this recipe is very good.",
