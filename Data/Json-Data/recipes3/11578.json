I find salting potatoes before they are baked makes them stick to the pan so I sprinkled with a little sea salt just after they were cooked. Otherwise I followed everything else in the recipe!

In addition to the lemon zest i grilled half a lemon and then squeezed it over right before serving. Also added in 3 Smashed garlic cloves just because i love garlic. I used Greek seasoning that i received in my Missing ingredient Package..and it is great! The Mint was awesome!..i will be making this again. Thank you for the awesome recipe!",
