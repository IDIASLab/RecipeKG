I carmelized the onions in a large pan, then I added the rest of the butter, tomato sauce, cream, and spices and simmered (on EXTREMELY low heat) for about 10 minutes. Then I added the ckicken bits right into the sauce mixture (without tandoori masala) and let it simmer on low for about 25 more minutes until the chicken was done, being careful not to boil the cream.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was delicious. I served it over basmati rice and garnished with fresh cilantro. My husband loved it! One of the best Indian recipes I've found.",

Another good idea is to add in vegetables! (red/green pepper's, carrots, asparagus etc.) it tastes GREAT and it adds a bit of health to the meal!  try adding them in about... 10 or 15 minutes b4 the sauce is done, depending how crunchy or soft you want the veggy's!  :) hope that helps! good luck! this is an AMAZING dish",

I cooked it all in one pot like someone else had suggested. Caramelized the onions with 2 tablespoons butter and set them aside, deglazed the pan with a little bit of chicken broth (low sodium kind), added the rest of the butter, tomato sauce, evaporated milk, salt, cayenne and curry. Stirred it, added cut up raw chicken, and then simmered for 25 min. Then stirred in the onions. It was fantastic over basmati rice, I would definitely make it again!!",
