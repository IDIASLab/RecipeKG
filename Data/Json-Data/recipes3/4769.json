I am not much of a beer drinker anymore but love the flavor and boldness it adds to food. I added raw onion to the top of my beans but that is just something my family did growing up and a habit I don't care to break. I've shied away from can goods here lately but this is one I won't be shying from period. I really enjoyed this. Thank you for sharing SweetBasil!",
