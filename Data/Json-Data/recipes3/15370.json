First I had to add some oil to my chocolate chips to get them to melt smooth enough. Second it became quickly apparent that there was way too much chocolate for 12 truffles. Luckily I had more of all the other ingredients. It seemed like a real pain to try to pour on top of the ingredients into the muffin pan so instead I poured the other ingredients into the chocolate and kept mixing until the consistency was right (at least twice as much as called for if not more. Unfortunately my chocolate was too hot and it melted some of the marshmallows. Uggghhh!!!! Once I had a good mixture I dropped them into mini muffin cups. It made about 28 truffles instead of 12. I scraped the remainder of the chocolate onto a spoon and put some popcorn marshmallows and peanuts on it. Yummy! I think I would actually make these again now that I know the secrets. Add oil to the chocolate and don't let it get too hot. Mix the stuff in one big bowl and then put them into the muffin tins. Good luck!",

Adding the milk and butter creates a ganache which is easier to bite through than solid chocolate. Also before pouring the chocolate move the ingredients to the sides by borrowing a hole in the middle of the ingredients... then pour the choc into the 'hole' and you will find that the chocolate holds the items together. Lastly pretzels broken into bite-sized pieces are a good substitute for the popcorn and seem to hold the crunch better. Another reviewer complained about chopping the chocolate... I used chocolate chips and found no need for chopping.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a very easy treat. The most challenging part of the dish is chopping a pound of chocolate though I think it is worth it to use chocoalte blocks as opposed to chips for quality. I made these for a picnic and they had softened by the time people ate them. They were messy but tasty. I would like to have tried them when the chocolate was still hardened by the cooling. Almost too rich for me with the amount of chocolate on each need to help hold the items together. I wonder if making a marshmallow paste of sorts to hold the ingredients together would be a good idea so you can then drizzle the chocolate sparingly over each \"truffle\". I may try that next time. Also I think dried cranberries may be a good addition to this recipe.",

I placed two pieces of buttered salted popcorn and two mini marshmallows on top of the chocolate. I used about 3/4 lb of chocolate with 1/4 cup cream to make it pourable.
