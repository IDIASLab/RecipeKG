The recipe does not state the margarine is too be room temperature or softened before mixing. I assumed with most recipes that is how it should be to cream with sugar. I don't use margarine so I used butter in it's place. After seeing the amount of powdered sugar in this recipe I decided to use ALL NATURAL peanut butter. I RECOMMEND this as the frosting was still very sweet. Also I added the mashed banana into the frosting. The frosting tasted delicious but was slightly runny for cupcakes so I put in the fridge for 1 hour and it was much easier to work with. THANKFULLY the taste of this frosting saved the cupcakes because they were not good at all. This was so good I didn't even frost all the cupcakes and we ate the frosting out of the bowl! This frosting REALLY DOES taste exactly like a PB and banana sandwich! I will definitely use this recipe again. (Special thanks to Cookies from the Recipe Exchange for recommending this recipe to me)!",

Additionally I wasn't about to dump a pound of confectioner's sugar in this thing without trying it first. I didn't really measure but since a pound of sugar would've been about 3 2/3 cups (per a google search anyway) I used nowhere near that amount. I would say I used at most 2 cups but think it was closer to 1 1/2. I'm not a fan of really sweet anything so I had hubs test it for me and he approved at about the 1 1/2 cup mark. If you love sweet frosting go right ahead and put it all in but that would not work for me. I used this to frost the Best Moist Chocolate Cake from here and it worked beautifully.
