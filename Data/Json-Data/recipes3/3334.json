Perfect for someone with a pomegranate tree who doesn't know what to do with them all. The pomegranate seeds are a little crunchy like slightly unpopped popcorn.

I didn't juice the pomegranate and just used the seeds. I wish I had juiced it or ground the seeds because the seeds were a bit cruncy. Finally if you are seeding a pomegranate yourself it will take a lot longer than the stated 5 minutes! I think it took me 30min to get the seeds out of the pomegranates (though maybe there is a faster technique)!",

With a very sharp knife I score the fruit into quarters again without cutting too deep. In a large deep bowl take the pomegranate and pull apart over the bowl. Take each quarter and place it skin side up in one hand with your fingers open. In your other hand take a wooden spoon and whack the skin side of the pomegranate. The seeds just fall out. Don't be afraid to hit fairly hard. You will be amazed how quickly the seeds fall out and the rind just stays on the skin. You may have to still pick a few seeds out but this is so simple. Have fun!!",
