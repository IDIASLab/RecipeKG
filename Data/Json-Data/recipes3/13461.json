I also used more shrimp than the recipe called for. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. The quesadillas had a lot of flavor and I will definitely make them again. Thanks for sharing.",

On that note I'll also say that you should plan on this only feeding one person and not two. With that being said this is an excellent recipe and one you will enjoy. There is nothing quite like the taste and smell of a roasted Hatch chile peppers!",
