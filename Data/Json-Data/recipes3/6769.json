If you make them by hand as  is the above recipe , well,  most Mennonites still use lard or crisco to fry them in. I use the Butter flavoured Crisco. The solid type, not the oil, and the flavour is marvelous. As well , in a pinch,  I've substituted a cans of  \"Grands \" biscuits , any type, and rolled each  biscuit out , with your  roller,  then cut the same wee slit in the middle of the dough, and turned bottom under top, of slit.   Again fantastic, and super easy for those who are a wee bit timid around making a dough. White corn syrup is the trick, and I warm it up a wee bit, as well, but maple syrup and jelly is great as well.  I truly believe the key to the perfect Rollkucken is the Butter Crisco. \n            As for the watermelon,  it truly  goes well with it . I put me watermelon  chilled , in a glass, with  corn syrup and Vodka.   What can I say?  I'm a modern Mennonite. Plus I've been cooking all day.  I deserve it.  Cheers to all and GOD bless.   From NV ",
