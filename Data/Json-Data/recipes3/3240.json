I chose not to cook them first and quite honestly I don't think I'd have liked them cooked. I didn't include the corn out of consideration for Hubs' sensitive innards and quite honestly I think they were better for that omission anyway. I reduced the amount of salt by half and since it was just right I can only imagine these would have been too salty had I used the full amount. I found I had to use a far greater amount of milk to get the dough to the correct consistency. I have no idea why this was so far off. Finally 350 degrees is a little too moderate for biscuits. I increased the temperature to the more conventional 425 degrees and baked them about 12-15 minutes. (Time of course will depend on your oven and the size of the biscuits. I dropped the dough by quarter cupfuls) Once out of the oven I brushed them with melted butter to which I had added California garlic salt. The biscuits baked up nice and plump with a golden and somewhat crispy exterior. You really do need that higher heat! The mixed colors of the bell peppers made these confetti-like pretty and the melted butter gave them a glossy sheen and a nice flavor from the garlic salt. I liked them a lot. The ultimate result was that the bell pepper was a tasty and interesting addition but unfortunately that was not enough to redeem the recipe from the issues I've outlined.",
