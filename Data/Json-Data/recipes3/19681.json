When I buy skinless boneless chicken breasts I put the chicken and italian salad dressing (Kraft brand Zesty Italian) in a freezer bag for freezing and then defrost in the fridge overnight--it marinates while defrosting.  Before grilling, I sprinkle with McCormicks Spicy Pepper Medley.  This is quick, easy and tastes great.  Leftovers can be added to a salad the next day.",
