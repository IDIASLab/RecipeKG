I diced the veggies fairly small so they wouldn't be too crunchy. Instead of mozzarella I had an Italian 5-cheese blend that I think made a difference. We all enjoyed this thanks Michelle!",

I made just a few changes to suit my family's tastes including subbing turkey breakfast sausage for the pork and subbing chopped mushrooms for the red onions. I also used one extra egg and a little more than 8 oz of sausage. A par-baked pizza crust from my grocery store's bakery was perfect. Total baking time for my oven was closer to 20-25 minutes but my oven is notorious for taking longer than rec'd times. Totally worth making it was delicious and filling for a Sunday morning breakfast. Thanks so much!",

I was out of sausage so I cooked bacon and crumbled it in the eggs as they cooked and added mushrooms and olives to the toppings. I don't normally eat eggs but this had enough other things to 'cover' the taste of the eggs and I really enjoyed it. I do think it would be much better with a hot sausage and will try it that way another weekend. Combine with a Mimosa and it made for a very special morning.:)",
