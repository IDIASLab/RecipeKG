After pan-frying the shrimp I poured the excess marinade in the pan and reduced by half to make a sauce. I Toasted some coconut and added that to some white rice I made and poured the sauce over the rice and sprinkled the shrimp with some leftover toasted coconut. Delicious!",

Next time I make this I will cut way back on the lime zest and add more orange juice. Hubby said he would have liked more sauce that he could put over the rice I served alongside. Maybe I'll add some crushed pineapple honey and a sprinkle of toasted coconut before serving to create a sweeter version. This recipe definetly needs some experimenting before you serve it to guests. Nice light recipe however; and easy to throw together.",
