I changed pretty much every ingredient to suit my gluten-free and dairy-free needs but I think the key was separating the flour and breadcrumbs. If anyone cares I used 1 c. gluten free all purpose flour 1/4 c almond milk 2 c. cornmeal mixed with 1-2 tsp italian seasoning and of course the eggs. It turned out great! Might be more flavorful with more salt or possibly some paprika?",
