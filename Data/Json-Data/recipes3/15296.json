I've never used the Duncan Hines mixes, but have opted for either a vanilla cake mix from Trader Joes or a cinnamon crumb/coffee cake mix from my local supermarket. I used 1 can of sliced peaches in light syrup and then frozen fresh peach slices (not thawed) to fill the bottom of the baking dish (the cake mixes have enough sugar that no extra sugar is needed). And I also sprinkled vanilla extract over the top of the cake mix before the melted butter. Delicious!!!",
