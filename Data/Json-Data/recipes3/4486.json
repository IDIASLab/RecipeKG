You can pretty much change the proportion of all spices and condiments to match your taste. So feel free to cut down on chillies. If you do not have dried mango power, just use fresh lemon juice and it will be just as good. For a different twist, add 1/4 cup thawed frozen coconut - this is very traditional around the Indian coast. Also, use peanut or vegetable oil instead of ghee to make it healthier.",

We both love the flavours from India and living in the Netherlands we have several excellent Indian restaurants nearby. Since I lost my job one month ago unexpectedly I have time now to enjoy my passion for cooking ethnic food. We loved these potatoes! I can handle much spicier food than my husband so I cut down on the spicier items...I do not think it was necessary...my husband would have liked the potatoes a little less dry...will try perhaps the suggestion of peanut oil next time. OH! I found the mango powder at at specicialty shop only 4 blocks from my house!! Curious to see how it is next time! A real winner recipe! Thank you...",
