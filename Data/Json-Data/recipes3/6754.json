Pureed this in blender, then added a tablespoon minced garlic, a teaspoon of dried thyme, the salt, cayenne pepper (also used black pepper). I skipped the egg whites and used 2 tablespoons of flax seed meal instead. I also added 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, and fried the fritters in coconut oil. They were so delicious! My vegan daughter got mad after the first bite because she thought they were crab cakes, which they sort of tasted like. My diners flipped when I told them the fritters were made of black eyed peas. I served them with a vegan mac and cheese and steamed broccoli florets.",

Before I made these fritters I fried some fish and I used the leftover grease to make the Kala in which added a nice flavor. I did not make balls because there wasn't enough oil so I made them into patties. The kala tasted ok but not much flavor. I think it would have been better had the flour been seasoned. Next time Im going to season the flour with some salt and garlic powder.",
