I did add a pkg of taco seasoning and some extra cumin and hot sauce so they came out very flavorful. The kids ate 'em up so that's what really matters:-) I will definitely make these again--thank you!",

I had some leftover well-seasoned Jamaican Jerk Grilled Pork to use so grated the red potatoes and sauteed them slightly in a mixture of butter and oil then added the thinly sliced meat and let both simmer until the potatoes were cooked through. I served the meat and potato mixture on a corn tortilla garnished with avocado chunks sour cream and cilantro. If I had not been using pre-seasoned meat I would definitely add some type of seasoning as without it the tacos would be too bland for my taste. I made these a second time again with leftover pork but I kept adding a little of this and a little of that until the end result was not really like the original recipe. I did grate the red potatoes and after they were slightly brown added the thin strips of pork. Then I added some medium salsa a pinch of cinnamon and some ground cumin a handful of raisins and enough water to let it all simmer together for a few minutes. Served the pork mixture on a flour tortilla topped with sour cream and shredded lettuce.",
