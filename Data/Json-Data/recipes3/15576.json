I would suggest that you do not do as I did and think that a little more would be better. The ingredients are strong-flavored and so a little goes a long way. This was good and it helped to extend a dinner of leftovers tonight. I appreciate the recipe! Thanks! EDIT 12/26/18: I have changed my mind about this. I would keep the ingredients just as written. When I made the whole batch and served it to company we all agreed that it is delicious as written! Please give it a try!",
