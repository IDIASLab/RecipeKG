Added them to the pan and put back in the oven for 15 minutes. The proscitto I have was rather wide so I wrapped it around the breasts without using toothpicks. Added the chicken to the pan when the veggies were done and finished baking for 20 minutes. When the chicken was done I took it out to rest & turned the broiler on to brown the veggies the way we like them!",

My proscuitto slices were almost exactly the same size and my chicken breasts so I just laid them on top instead of wrapping. I quartered the potatoes but they were still a little firm compared to the other veggies. Next time I will take other reviewers' suggestions of putting only the taters in first then adding the veggies & chicken. Next time I would also add baby carrots. All in all though this is an easy weeknight dinner and a great way to get a couple of servings of veggies in. Oh! I almost forgot my sister and I were able to make 4 not 2 meals out of this. Thanks for sharing Betty!",
