After retrieving everything and I was very excited to use healthy stuff I looked for the preheat temperature. Double checked seeing no eggs in the ingredient list proceeded. The dough was a perfect play dough consistency and rolling them in the seeds went well since they were not messy sticky. I used a small cookie scoop and got 30 balls calculating to 84.8 calories per. Needed more seeds; the large container of seeds I used were already toasted so saved a step. Great flavors to our taste since we love everything in them. This will be a fun cookie project for my granddaughters since they can safely make them from start to finish; want them to learn healthy cookie making. Hope the batter consistency is as good when I make these again with gluten free flour. Thank you for creating this recipe. Doemama",

They are fun and easy to make especially since no baking is required! You can start em then attend to something else (e.g. said nursing child) then come back whenever you're ready since they won't spoil. I've left them on the counter halfway done all day. To get a good application of seeds: first don't skip the toasting step it does add a lot of flavor. (You can toast a lot all at once then keep them in your pantry for next time.) Shake the seeds in a flat shallow bowl so they are all together then roll the ball in the seeds. It'll be a little wonky/lumpy/square shaped. Then roll them in your hands again. This really helps the seeds to stick and the ball will regain its nice round shape.",
