At the time we learned how to make this recipe, we also learned how to make homemade bisquits, and we served this over gravy mixture over the bisquits.  It was really good, and very simple to make.

This is a great way to use up the last of your eggs before shopping day. To beef it up a bit for my boys I added one pound of ground pork that I spiced up a bit with sage red pepper flake more paprika and fresh ground pepper. Instead of bread I served this over homemade fluffy whole wheat biscuits. Easy for Mom hearty enough for a brinner night for my three men. Win/win. Thanks Dana.
