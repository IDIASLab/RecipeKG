I use whatever onions I have on hand but the red onion called for in the recipe is best.   I do not use the shallot or fresh rosemary because I never have those on hand.  Because I'm lazy, I mix everything together in a large bowl including all the oil and balsamic vinegar plus seasonings -- I use dried Italian seasoning in place of the fresh rosemary.  I also add a little bit cayenne pepper to for a little bit more spice to the flavor (less than a 1/4 teaspoon or to taste).  I do not cook the balsamic on the stovetop at all -- too many extra steps for me.  I put everything on a greased sheet pan and roast for 30 minutes, stir and roast an additional 15-30 minutes because my husband loves them slightly charred.  They turn out great and my husband devours them.  Every once in a while I add crumbled bacon.",
