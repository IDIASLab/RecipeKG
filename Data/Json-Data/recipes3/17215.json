If you can use organic vegetables, the soup will have a glorious color and taste more intense. Most people cannot tell that you have used coconut milk instead of cream. This makes it not only taste good, but full of all the health benefits of the coconut. Add a dollop of plain Greek yogurt or some chopped parsley, or drizzle with good quality, cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy and taste the golden color of the sun!",

The house smelled wonderful.  Cooked the pumpkin and  vegetables in the chicken broth and water and added 2 boullion cubes and cooked until tender.  Then I blended the vegetables with the immersion blender till creamy and then added the cocoanut milk (2 cans) and blended that into the soup.  It was yummy, but then I added about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of pure maple syrup and 1 tblsp of butter and this soup became heavenly.  This soup tastes like the first time I ever tried pumpkin soup at the casino.  Awesome, Awesome !  Don\u2019t leave out the spices, they really work with this soup.  Thanks to the originator who shared this.",
