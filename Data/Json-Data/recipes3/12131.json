Both my compatriot and i enjoyed these very much so great job on the recipe. Mostly these aren't far off from cheddar herb biscuits. I don't think the asparagus and capers are bringing much to the table but they don't detract either (which was a small surprise.) I suppose it's worth the effort to be able to say you ate an asparagus muffin. After all what is life without trying new things tasting new flavors finding little vacations within your life.
