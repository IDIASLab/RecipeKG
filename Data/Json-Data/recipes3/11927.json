Add the broth slowly and continue to stir constantly.  Used a lovely balsamic reduction over the top.  Will certainly make again.",

I made two adjustments - I used baby bella mushrooms in place of the morels, and dried thyme for the fresh (fresh would have been better, but my herb garden didn't make it through the winter).
