I believer a good friend chicken should not have to be dipped (or chicken strips in my case)\n\nI followed the recipe exactly (including the beer, I used my favorite Icehouse) anyways, I used Granulated Garlic instead of Garlic salt and after I tested my first piece I decided it needed more flavor.  In the batter I put 2 table spoons of All Season Salt and 1 table spoons of Celery Salt and WOW!  They are awesome to eat even without dip.\n\nAnyways, I wanted to leave my .02 cents because this recipe really is very good and worth it.",

To boost the flavour of the chicken, I marinated it in buttermilk with garlic salt, poultry seasoning, and a dash of tabasco. Chicken was flavourful and moist and the coating was crispy and delicious. Make sure your oil is hot enough and, if you fry in batches that it comes back up to temp between batches. This will prevent greasy coating.",

Several hours later even after sitting on the counter it was by far the most cripsy chicken I have ever eaten! KFC's secret recipe has nothing on this one. The spices were a little more salty than I like but it was still a great tasting treat. Next time I will use plain garlic instead of garlic salt and maybe try some crushed red pepper or chili powder to bump up the spice. This will definitley become a hurricane necessity along with bottle water and flashlights! Thanks for the post.",
