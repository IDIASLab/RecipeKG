I took the advice of many of the previous reviewers and used more mushrooms, including chopped portabello, twice as much Marsala wine (the sweet variety), and slivered garlic added with the mushrooms.  I also simmered the entire thing for 35 minutes covered for the first 20 and then uncovered for the last 15.  In addition, I decided to put in a bit of heavy cream at the end, which I figured couldn't hurt!",

I added a tablespoon of minced garlic and about 1/2 cup of extra mushrooms. I served it with steamed spinach and a garlic mashed potatoes recipe I found on this site. I doubled the sauce (but still only used 1 tablespoon of butter) so I would have enough to spoon over the chicken and the potatoes. I will *definitely* be making this one again. \r\n\r\nThe sauce is pretty thin, so you'll need to add a little cornstarch/water to thicken it. If you feel there is too much of an \"alcohol\" taste, just add a couple tablespoons of chicken broth to dilute it. I always do. Also, try adding a little bacon grease to the sauce sometime. (although it will defeat the purpose of having a \"light\" chicken marsala recipe) It really gives it a smooth, almost creamier taste.\r\n\r\nThanks for the wonderful recipe!",

You definitely need to add more marsala wine as there was not enough gravy at all.  I only made 2 chicken breasts with this recipe had increased marsala wine to 1 cup.  We still ran low since it cooked down so much.  I will add 2 cups next time.  The recommendation to let it simmer for 30 minutes was perfect.  If you don't the wine doesn't cook down.  YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY! Served over angel hair pasta and used canned mushrooms.",
