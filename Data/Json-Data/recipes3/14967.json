I followed the recipe exactly...except for a minor change. I didn't have coconut milk, but I did have almond/coconut blend. I wasn't sure what to expect because the mixture seemed very thin at first. I whisked it for a couple minutes til fully blended and it did thicken up. Coconut flour does absorb liquids quite well. The muffins are smallish (hmmm, maybe that's why I ended up eating 4 the day I made them! Oops!) but a nice size for a quick snack. These actually taste more like cupcakes to me. They have a slight eggy texture, but nothing that's unpleasant. The honey and vanilla flavors really come through. Next time I might even use slightly less honey - not because of the flavor, but just to lower the sweetness a bit.  The only thing I might suggest is to maybe use less butter because the bottoms were greasy. I might even try this with coconut oil! Thanks Chris for sharing your recipe!",

I also dribbled shredded coconut and slivered almonds on top of the batter before baking - really yummy! Finally, in order to avoid the small muffins, I TRIPLED the recipe and I got 12  full muffins, as you can see from the picture where they are still in my ceramic muffin baker. That means I had to use nine eggs for twelve muffins, so I am telling myself that they are pretty abundant in protein too - breakfast?!?!?   ;-D",

I really enjoyed the muffins; they had a less eggy taste and consistency than other coconut flour muffins that I have I made. I used these minor adjustments or adaptations: Instead of coconut milk I used the same amount of unsweetened vanilla almond milk. Also in addition to vanilla extract I added the same amount of coconut and almond extract. Although the butter seemed melted enough after a few seconds in the microwave it still got chunky when I added it to the liquids bowl so it seemed that I had to blend the liquid and dry ingredients more than indicated in the recipe. Finally I topped with sliced almonds and coconut before I baked them for about 20 minutes at 400 as indicated. I used lightly greased silicone muffin cups and when they were cool they popped right out and into my mouth.",
