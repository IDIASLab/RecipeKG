The salsa verde I had was fresh so needed something to smooth it out it was also a little heavy on the garlic so I didn't use additional. I used fresh spinach(1/2 tub) and just chopped it and mixed in with the cheese mixture along with the onions. I added everything to the tortillas (8 in) cold and tossed it in the oven for 25 minutes. It sounds like a ton of changes but in my head it's only a couple. We got 4 servings but I didn't measure too carefully.",
