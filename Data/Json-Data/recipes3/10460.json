The store did not have any bok choy so I had to settle for fresh brussels sprouts... Believe it or not?? The peeled leaves of a few worked perfectly and were not too strong in flavor. I used a whole carrot and shredded instead of julienne. I also used 1 large clove of garlic and added a pinch of basil. I polished it off with 3 eggs instead of 2 and gave it a touch of pepper spiced vinegar ( rice vinegar preferred ). It was magnificent.. This recipe is very good but has some development needed.",
