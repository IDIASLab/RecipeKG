It gave this a great flavor. I ended up cooking it about 35 minutes. After I cut it there was a very small pool of liquid in the bottom of the dish and on the plates that took away from the appearance just a little. This might not have happened had I used a full fat cottage cheese. I made this for a side to salmon but I see enjoying it for lunch too.",
