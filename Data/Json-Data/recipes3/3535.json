However, I tried it, as I wanted a plain burger that I could top with ketchup, mustard, onions, and pickles - in other words traditional toppings. I'm not one for fish burgers or anything gourmand-like like that. \n\nTo the user that said that this burger was tasteless, I would say that the burger would be tasteless by itself and with no condiments. However, I added a slice of cheese (let it melt a bit under the burger patty), pickles, ketchup, mustard, a couple slices of onions, and wow. It was great. Let me just say that I won't be going to Burger King for a while. This burger tasted great - it tasted so juicy and meaty! I had one for lunch and one for dinner. Deelish.",

It's simple and if you look at the ingredients the flavor will come from the beef you use, so use a good grade of beef.  It also holds the burger together well on the grill.  It's almost like what McDonald's uses. This is the perfect base to add some really great condiments.  I used cheese, pickles, finely chopped onion, lettuce, tomato and \"Best Burger Sauce\" from this site. I normally don't do that with other burger recipes from this site because they stand on their own due to the amount of seasonings, spices and other additions.  Those call for just lettuce, tomato and bun.  You don't want to ruin the flavor with a bunch of condiments. If you're looking for a lot of spice this isn't for you.  If you want to experiment with some different toppings or condiments this is the burger to try it on!",
