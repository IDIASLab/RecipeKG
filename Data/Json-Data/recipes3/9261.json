The next day I made a batch using one mango (including the juice) instead of peach mixed it in with the original peach version that was left over and it was just excellent! The sweetness from the mango and its juices really helped round out the acidity. The mango also helped to thicken the salsa giving it a really nice consistency that clung to tortilla chips. I highly recommend the use of the avocado which adds to the texture color and lends a nice creaminess. Also recommend dicing the avocado place it in a separate bowl and bathe it in the lemon juice before adding to the salsa if you use lime instead it makes the avocado a bit tart. With modifications guests raved!",

Maybe the red onion the poster used was very small but I have only ever seen large red onions for sale. I should have gone with my gut when I thought it seemed like too much. I will try adding another peach to the leftovers to see if I can dilute the onion a bit. Other than that to prevent the avocado going brown I added the ingredients in the order of citrus juices first then I tossed the diced avocado in the juices before adding everything else. I also substituted basil for the cilantro. I think it could have used more heat but that is just personal preference. I served it over broiled salmon tips with a basmati-quinoa pilaf a spring green salad with blueberry vinaigrette and fresh broccoli. The perfect summertime meal!",
