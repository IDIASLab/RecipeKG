(Hubs didn't like them but he doesn't count because he doesn't like Parmesan or Asiago cheese). I used Panko bread crumbs and mixed olive oil right into the cheese/crumb mixture rather than drizzling it over the top. The topping was flavorful light crispy and golden brown and I was lucky to have red-ripe Roma tomatoes to begin with. Beautiful and delicious addition to the dinner plate.",
