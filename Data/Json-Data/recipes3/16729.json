I nuked 2 large chicken breasts in some of the broth while sauteing chopped onion and garlic in some olive oil then when chicken was cooked chopped and added it with the broth. I also added some chopped green chilies because I'm from New Mexico and I was craving some heat. I wanted the soup a little thicker so I added some instant potato flakes and a little cornstarch and water. It was the bomb! My daughter sprinkled hers with grated parmesan and crushed tortilla chips and it really was like eating dip. Thanks for the great recipe!",
