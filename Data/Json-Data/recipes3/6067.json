Thats what i did, after cooking the steak i removed, let rest, added onion and mushrooms, red wine, salt, pepper, and at the end tablespoon of butter. Great on top of the steak.  I served the whole thing on top of soft polenta. really good.",

                "reviewBody": "I love the seasonings used for this steak. I prepared the steaks using rib eye as it was what I had on hand. For the seasoning mix I minced up some fresh thyme rather than dried chopped up 1 garlic clove mixed these with rock salt black pepper and paprika. I rubbed the seasonings into the rib eye steak and let it sit like that in the refriegerator for a couple of hours. In a skillet I added olive oil heated up on medium high heat. I fried the steak on one side searing it until it was golden brown before turning it over to other side. When the steaks were done I set them aside to rest and to let the juices redistribute while I sauteed the mushrooms. To the same skillet I added 2T butter shallots and 1 garlic chopped up and I stirred it up with all the brown bits in the pan. then I added the mushrooms sliced in half stirred added white wine not red wine and cooked it for a few minutes. The seasonings added a nice flavor to the steaks and also to the mushroom sautee. I really liked the flavor of the fresh thyme. The wine also adds flavor to the mushrooms along with the brown bits mixed in. My only small criticism is with the submitter's cooking method to use two separate skillet's whereas you could use the same skillet to prepare both the steak and mushrooms. The brown bits from the steaks is what really adds more flavor to the mushrooms. I topped the mushrooms on the steaks and served it along with Rosemary Zuchhini Sticks also from this website.",
