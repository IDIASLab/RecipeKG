Instead, I sauted the onion and bacon till tender.  then I tossed in the diced potatoes and cooked a little bit.  Finally I added the green beans and a cup of broth, salt and pepper stirred it all up and simmered until veggies were tender.   Lastly I added a can of Cream of Mushroom and more broth to make it 'soupy'.    Husband loved it!",

I used the strained broth to cook the potatoes until they were almost done then added frozen cut beans til cooked. I mixed the cream of chicken soup with only 1 cup of milk and added that to the soup.  I wasn\u2019t sure how to add onions so I cooked them separately in a pan with bacon drippings. Next time I\u2019d add them with the potatoes.  Thanks for submitting this easy and delicious recipe. I appreciated the addition of a cream  soup to this recipe.
