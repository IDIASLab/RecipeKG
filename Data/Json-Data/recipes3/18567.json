My blender works better if you put the liquids in first and then the ice.  I put everything in the blender and whatever room I had left I filled with ice.  I made this for a dinner party and went through 3 pitchers!  (for only 4 people)  Very tasty.  Used salt instead of sugar on the rims of the glasses but I'm sure either way is just as good.",
