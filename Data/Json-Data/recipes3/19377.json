In my opinion this recipe was more time consuming than many brownie recipes. Make sure to cool bars completely cut into small pieces and have LOTS of milk nearby!! The only thing I will do differently next time is to melt the caramel in a glass bowl over pan with boiling water (double broiler effect). The caramel made a mess out of my pot. I had to put water in the pot and heat to get all the caramel out. However the preparation and clean up was WORTH every bite!",

Only thing I would change is use a smaller pan-not the 9x13 because they were very thin and i like my brownies thicker. My students loved them!!",
