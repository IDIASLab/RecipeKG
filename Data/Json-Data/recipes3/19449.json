I followed the recipe to a T and the brownies didn't get done. I baked them for a friend and ended up throwing the mush away. If you're looking for the \"best brownie\" try the recipe on this site called \"Best Brownies\" with over 1200 5 star ratings. THOSE are perfect brownies. Even the taste of these undone brownies was too rich for my taste and you can't often say that for I LOVE rich foods! Sorry just not my cup of tea I guess.:-) Ally",

The only ingrediant that is different is the vanilla - I don't use it. A couple of things I have found that have help me is to: #1 Melting your butter is the way to go... it allows you to spread 1/2 the cake mix like frosting for the bottom cake layer rather than pressing it into the pan. #2 Melt the caramels (and evaporated milk) in the MICROWAVE (for about 3 minutes on high) Use as much or as little of the caramel as you want. #4 The remaining half of the cake mix I take a teaspoon and blob the mix on top. It allows for the caramel and chocolate chips (and whatever else) to peek through. #5 The last helpful hit to cut the bars into a size of about 2 bits more than that the richness overwhelms people.",

They are sticky and gooey and \"out of this world\" delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly; the only thing I did differently was to melt the caramels with the evaporated milk in the microwave instead of on the stovetop. It was quicker & easier. Also I lined the baking pan with non-stick foil and sprayed it with Pam for easy removal of these sticky little delights! I'm sure I will make these again and again; thanks for a fantastic recipe!!",

We have a little \"river of caramel\" flowing around the top after it's baked. We've also given this out as gifts to people who can't stop eating after just one...their that good!

Instead of baking the first half of the mixture alone I did this- pour the first half in the pan spread out. Top with the caramel mixture and then the chocolate chips. Bake on the bottom rake of the oven for 8 minutes. Remove from oven. Spread remaining brownie mixture on top. Continue baking as instructed on middle rack of oven. This makes the caramel and choclate layers absolutely incredible! Make sure they are cooled well before cutting! These brownies are now requested by my son's swim team for every meet.",
