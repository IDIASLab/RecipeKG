Then I will just roll them and use a toothpick or two to keep them shut! \r\nI serve it with risotto and salad..it's a great meal!",

I used chicken breasts cut into the middle with poultry knife to form a pocket and stuffed with a mixture of sun-dried tomatoes grated Parmesan ricotta oregano and crushed Triscuit crackers (didn't have walnuts nor breadcrumbs so I substitute with crushed Triscuit crackers to get the nutty crunchy taste). At first I was afraid the chicken will dry out within the 45 minutes of baking but that was not the case at all! Make sure to smother with olive oil it adds a nice touch of flavor.",

Used seasoned bread crumbs \u2013 everything in the recipe measurements.  Ohhh my gosh, best stuffed chicken EVER!  Pounded the chicken very thin so baked at 375 for only 25min before topping each breast with a tbs of reserved stuffing and then broiled another 10 min until it had melted and browned\u2026looked perfect!  Next time I may cut the pine nuts back a bit, I love them but it may be too much for some.  Thanks for an easy great recipe!!!",

I made some changes based on other reviews and using what I had on hand. Instead of boneless chicken I used bone-in chicken (which I recommend trying) replaced ricotta for cottage cheese and used pecans instead of walnuts (chopped fine). Based on other reviews I sauted 2 garlic cloves in olive oil added about half to cheese mixture and used the rest to brush the chicken. After I brushed the chicken with oil I added salt pepper plain bread crumbs basil and oregano on top of the chicken. It came out moist and delicious!",

The stuffing turned out wonderful. I had a lot left over so I just sprinkled the rest on top of the breasts and it came out nice and golden brown. Perhaps sun dried tomatoes? Different cheeses? There's so much you could add on to this recipe. I paired tender baby carrots warm apples and big crescent rolls with this to make it a meal.",
