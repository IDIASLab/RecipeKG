First I'd start with only about 4-5 ounces of the almonds because I had a whole bunch left over. The little pinch of Italian seasoning would not even come close to flavoring that amount of almonds. Next time I would only stovetop it because putting it in the oven only took a few minutes after browning it in the pan. But we loved the flavors and the almond coating. I was surprised that the almonds stuck to the chicken without using an egg dip and we loved the crunch of the almonds. Thanks for this recipe because I will make it again!",
