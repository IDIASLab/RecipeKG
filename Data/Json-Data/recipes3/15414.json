They do in fact have choco chips in them but it is not the predominant taste by any measure. The most dominant flavor is that of the yakon syrup.\n\nI do think they must be quite healthy. But the other thing to consider is the cost of a couple of the ingredients. Yakon syrup was $16 for 8 oz. You don't use that much but you still have to buy it and to substitute with molasses as someone suggested seems to defeat the purpose of making something healthy. The 1 C of cashew butter is an expense of $12. I couldn't even tell it was in there.\n\nThey're tasty enough. But they're not chocolatey. Given that and the cost to make, I doubt I'll make them again, unless I can't figure out what to do with the rest of the yakon syrup.",
