Zoodles are so fun!\" I've never done anything w/ zoodles other than eat them w/ spaghetti sauce and meatballs so this was a fun departure from my dinner norm as it was entirely different and I had it for lunch and I was skeptical of how cilantro would taste in it. I followed the recipe except tossing in maybe a couple TBs of diced onions w/ the zoodles. With a squirt of Sriracha this was a really tasty omelet; if only I could think of a way to incorporate a protein into it so I could make double it for my husband and I but I'm at a loss as to whether ham bacon sausage or some other form of meat would complement squash and cilantro... Still YUMMY as written!",

I used spray olive oil instead of the butter, a little garlic salt, and tossed in some left-over quinoa with Parmesan instead of the mozzarella, added cilantro at the end, and folded over to let the cheese melt.
