This is a comfort food type dish and works extremely well at that. I happened to have some cooked pintos and made my own refried beans. I also had some leftover smoked chicken that I used. I cut back on the bell peppers a bit in deference to my 12 year-old's taste. It was great! I am sure it would have been as good had I stuck to the recipe completely. I will be doing variations of this recipe in the future. It's a fun one to play with not to mention eat!",

I also cut the amount of refried beans by half...family preference and used more ground beef. This is a hearty dish that can feed quite a crowd. Be sure to let sit about 10 minutes then it slices into nice size serving squares. You can have so much fun changing this recipe around each time you make it!",

Also I only had a 15oz can of refried beans but this turned out to be great as I'm afraid it would've been to soggy with the called for amount of 30oz. I also added sliced black olives because we like them. The only other change I would make is serving it with guacamole along with the picante sauce. A keeper but be warned; this makes a lot! If you're feeding four or less I'd halve it. Thanks for a terrific recipe!",
