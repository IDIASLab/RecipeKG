I used Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Sheets. \n\nI used boneless and skinless chicken breast and thighs. Also, I used fresh vegetables: carrots, celery, potatoes, and mushrooms while I did use frozen peas. My casserole dish, 9 inches, was smaller too. \n\nI had to lower the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit because I used my convection/toaster oven which tends to get hotter quickly. The bottom crust layer took exactly 25 minutes to brown with the foil on top. However the top crust in the final cooking became the perfect golden brown around the 30 minute mark. To keep the crust from burning, I added a sheet of foil over the top for the remaining 20 minutes of cook time.",
