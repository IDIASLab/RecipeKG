After 6 minutes, which seemed to long, I pulled the lid, put lemon on the chicken and continued to cook, I already found by tasting it was overcooked and tough. I turned the fire off after just 3 minutes, but this chicken is way overcooked. Did people really cook tenderloins at medium high heat for 6 minutes each side and have nice tender non over cooked chicken? This recipe as far as cooking times goes, sucks!!!",
