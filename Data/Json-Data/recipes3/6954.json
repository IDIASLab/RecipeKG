The spread cheese is good on this although you can use a cheaper brand with the same results. I might consider making the tomato mixture way in advance we had leftovers and the mixture tasted better the next day. I put tiny cubes of mozzarella on top for looks and flavor. If your not eating right away I would suggest you make sure the toast is very hard...the tomato mixture will seep into the toast and make it softer.",
