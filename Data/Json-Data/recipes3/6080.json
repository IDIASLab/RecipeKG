If the chicken is first browned, then allowed to cook for the length of time suggested, I'm afraid you'll end up with rubber. I zapped my sprouts (halved) and onions with the chicken broth in the microwave to get them started, then added the browned chicken and cooked for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. This turned out very well.",

The recipe in itself is quite good but next time I think I'll try using garlic and maybe a bit of bacon as suggested by other reviewers. And fresh rosemary might even be better than the dried one. Will make again:) Edit: I made it a second time but omitted the part of frying the chicken. I let it cook in the stock whilst baking. It turned out just fine. I also added a bit of garlic and I liked the added flavour but then I like just about anything with garlic;) I didn't use/eat the stock but I guess you could freeze it for making soup later etc. I will continue to try this dish with other changes maybe it has great potential for those of us who love sprouts:)",
