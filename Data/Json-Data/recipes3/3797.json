I would definately recommend using a 9x13 pan as what I considered a \"medium\" baking dish wouldn't hold it. And I chopped my (2 kinds) of squash pretty small as someone recommended. My family all loved it and we aren't big squash eaters especially. Had wonderful flavor and texture, nice comfort food. Pretty easy to make too! I've saved it to my recipe box - it'll be one of my regulars, especially for a crowd!",

                "reviewBody": "ONe of the reviews stated this was dry and blah. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a delicious moist and yummy casserole. ONe tip is to put a lid on your pan when you are cooking the squash and onions together. This keeps the moisture in the pan. Just be careful not to leave too much juice as your casserole can be runny. I would cook the first half with a lid on and then remove the lid so some of the liquid evaporates into the air. Then add your cheese etc. If for some reason it may seem to runny after you have added cheese and other ingredients a few extra crackers will help. ( I used ritz crackers) Also baking with or without a cover makes a difference in the crunchiness of your topping and the dryness of your casserole. I actually added a little bit of water to my stuffing along with the butter to make it a tiny bit moist. Don't add too much though just a tablespoon or so. Anyhow I encourage you to make it and pay attention to these things then the 2nd time you make it will be perfect. The flavor is always great!",

                "reviewBody": "Outstanding and the rave reviews are a testament to that. A couple minor alterations: 16 reduced fat Ritz crackers replacing 12 saltine crackers and used herb seasoned stuffing. Nicely filled a 9 x 13 (3 qt.) baking dish (lightly sprayed w/ olive oil). Lightly sprayed saucepan w/ olive oil rather than using butter when cooking the squash and onions. In further reducing the overall 10 tablespoons of butter in this casserole only used 3 tablespoons to make the stuffing crust... don t think a noticeable taste difference resulted. Used a pinch of salt to cut down on high sodium level for a relatively small sized serving (i.e. roughly 3 x 4 size). For special occasions I would make this recipe the same way again. If part of an everyday meal the aim would be to make a healthier version... experiment w/ using 2/3 cup light ranch dressing & 1/3 cup mayo rather than 1 cup mayo. This is one of the most delicious vegetable casseroles we ve found on this site. Thanks NANCD35.",
