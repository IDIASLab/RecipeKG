I only had half a cup of sour cream, so that's all I used. I used 5 oz of large shrimp but cut them up first. I also used a cheddar/jack mix and onion powder instead of green onion. After hearing that some thought it was bland, I added a little tabasco, garlic powder, ground mustard, and dried parsley for color.  It was so good.",
