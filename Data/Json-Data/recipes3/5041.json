I also use less flour, about 2 3/4 cup. And I use 1 tsp of salt. I learned that the hard way. The first few times I made it it would fall in the middle, then I researched bread making and I learned that the salt keeps it from falling in the middle. Now I love making this bread and giving it as gifts, it's really delicious. ",

That much cardamom gave it a medicinal taste. Perhaps it was because the bottle of cardamom was brand new so it was more potent - don't know for sure. Shame on me - I should have followed the recipe as written the first time since I believe that subtlety works so much better in bread products than in-your-face spice does. As written this recipe is most likely just about perfect.",
