Whenever I've served it to my family or dinner guests it is always extremely well received. In fact my Grandfather literally cries if he finds out I made it and didn't invite him over. The base is so good and versatile I've tried it with all kinds of different vegetables stuff I had leftover in the fridge etc... and it's still marvelous. The only changes I make consistently now - I like the sweet Italian turkey sausage in it it's not so greasy I usually do a mix of half beef broth and half vegetable broth and I always cook my tortellini before adding it at the end. And for the people who can't seem to add the ketchup- try really hard to overcome your fear you're missing out on one of the keys that adds a certain \"richness\" to this recipe and (in my opinion) makes it so exceptional. Thank you Charlotte!!!",

I didn't measure precisely just kind of threw everything together but I did use more garlic and less ketchup. I used dried spinach tortellini cooking it separately and adding it at the last. I wasn't sure I would like the red pepper something I'm not familiar with in soup but I did find it a different taste twist I really enjoyed. As for hubs he enjoyed this soup so much he asked me to send him to work with it for his lunch--for the next two days!",
