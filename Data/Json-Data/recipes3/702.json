I didn't measure the milk, as how much you use depends on how you plan to use the frosting, and in my case I piped it, so I'm sure I used less than the recipe directed.",

Just make sure you put in enough of the powdered sugar or it will get a bit runny and drip out the sides of the cake... Still tastes good but looks kinda weird! Also I'd recommend sifting the sugar before putting it in the frosting. We didn't do this because we didn't have a sieve handy but I think it would have eliminated the somewhat gritty texture (that's why I gave it 4 stars).",
