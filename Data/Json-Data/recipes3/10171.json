It is so much easier if you visit an area Mexican Grocer and buy the meat already thinly cut from the meat counter. These were very good. We grilled for a bit then popped in the oven in a foil-covered pan. We cut slits in the foil and let it bake on 275 for about a hour so that the meat would get even more tender. We served on warm tortillas with cotija cheese green onions cilantro refried beans and salsa. Yummy",
