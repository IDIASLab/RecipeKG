The raw cane sugar and whole wheat pastry flour are the best to use because they are the least processed ingredients available and retain more of their natural goodness. The chunky apple bits give me more for my bite and add another level of sweetness to the muffin. These make a great breakfast or brunch item, or you can have one with a cup of coffee and unwind! Enjoy!",

I would recommend checking on your muffins after 20 minutes cooking time though as this was all the time mine needed in the oven, any longer and they would have been over done. Also be sure to only mix your ingredients until just moistened to avoid your muffins turning out tough. Thank you so much for providing a great healthy recipe for my family :)",

I followed the recipe except that I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and I used just plain white sugar. I also used all white flour instead of half and half. I think that next time I might try replacing that tablespoon of oil for a tablespoon of applesauce - it's a common baking swap and seeing as these are apple muffins I think that the applesauce would lend nicely to the apple flavor of the muffin. I also only had vanilla yogurt on hand so I used that - which was another reason that I chose to lessen the amount of sugar used. The chunks of apples in the muffin were a really nice treat! The recipe states that it only makes a dozen muffins but I got a dozen and a half so that was nice! This was a great recipe!",
