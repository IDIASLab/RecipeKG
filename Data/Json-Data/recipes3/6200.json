I altered the recipe with 1 1/2 tsp of dried red pepper instead...so it provided the needed heat but not the major intensity. I also used Talapia as my fish and as we are Muslim we always use halal products as well so I used a halal fish stock cubes for my broth. For the coconut milk I used the coconut WATER instead! We had recently opened a coconut & i had saved the water in an ice cube tray for use in curries in lieu of milk-- So we ended up with this really nice tropical style dish with a slight hint of the coconut & peppers--none of it too overwhelming--all of the flavors blended SO well!!!! and yet it was very much unlike anything he had eaten in the past! He really enjoyed this & has requested I prepare this again in the future!",
