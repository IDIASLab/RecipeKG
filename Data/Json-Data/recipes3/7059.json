In order for them not to fall apart, BRING THE WATER TO A SIMMER, not to a boil.",

We just drizzle it with good olive oil and shave a little fresh parmesan over the top and it's perfection.",

No, the wonton wrappers are not ideal but oh so easy it makes up for it! A few hints about wonton wrappers. They are NOT all created equal!! The kind from regular grocery stores are often thin and cheap thus harder to use and more chance of ripping. if you get a chance, get some from an actual asian market, however the \"nasoya\" brand from wal-mart are better then others. It makes a HUGE HUGE HUGE difference! For all of those who lost filling... 1) USE BETTER WONTON WRAPPERS! 2) you MUST make sure that every tiny part of the 'seam' is completley pinched shut! 3) do not over stuff or the filling will burst the seams. 4) squeeze all of the air out. That promotes ripping! A change I think I'll make permenant is to add some chopped spinach. Defrost, squeeze out all the liquid as possible, mix in when you add the cheese. To seal I just used beaten egg, no milk. Topped it off with \"newman's own\" vodka sauce. compliments it nicely! YUUMMMMM!",

I also used dried herbs; 1tsp dried rather than 1 tbps fresh.  I'm certain the flavours would be stronger with the fresh herbs.  I also used the basic pasta recipie as I'm not a fan of wonton wrapper ravioli.  This recipe was creamy and flavourful.  To duplicate the sauce I used a sundried tomato alfredo with 1 cup of smoked edam cheese melted in.  Top with fresh disced tomatos and green onions and it's not just like Olive Garden, it's better!

The one thing I did not do (based on what others said) was use the won ton wrappers. Instead I decided on making my own fresh pasta and using a rippled edge cookie cutter to make the ravioli shape. It took a while. If I were going to do it from scratch I would have to start a 3pm to have it ready for dinner but so worth it. This is a great recipe! I gave the ravioli to others to try.

Let me say that the filling was outstanding. I placed one ravioli in a pot per directions (Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil) and within 2-3 minutes it had disintegrated. I was stunned and thought I did something wrong so I tried another same thing. Honestly it was comical. I was now in the Ravioli Twilight zone. They were disappearing before my eyes. To save the night I had to go to plan B rigatoni with homemade sauce. Success!! Perhaps the ravioli should not be placed in boiling water? Puzzled about this one so if anyone wants to shed some light I would very much appreciate it because as I said the filling was great! Thanks!",
