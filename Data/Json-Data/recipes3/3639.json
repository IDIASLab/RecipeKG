I used corn starch instead of flour to thicken the white sauce and also added onion and garlic powder and oregano for the lack in flavor. I added some canned diced tomatoes to the beef mixture. Lastly rather than mozzarella I used 2C of monteray jack and 2C of extra sharp cheddar (mixed and divided evenly in mixture and on top). These cheeses gave the dish a more distictive flavor rather than the typical mozzarella in a pasta dish. Even great as a leftover...not dry at all like most left over pasta dishes!",
