This was tasty overall but rather wet and needed some contrast in textures. The potatoes started crisp but after adding them to the beef/cabbage mix they got wet too. We ate this and enjoyed what we had but voted not to have it again. The bacon should have been crisp to suit me and I picked the limp pieces out. Just my picky preference though. Overall a good recipe and it was worth giving it a try.",

I added a bit more salt, pepper, and apple juice than the recipe called for so my dish didn't turn out to be too bland at all (in fact it had a nice blend of savory and a touch of sweet flavors) - also I added in some garlic with the onions and let the onions/bacon sautee/crisp up some before I added the ground beef. I didn't find the recipe to be too soggy as well (maybe because I  did what some other reviewers did and added them in at the last second so the potatoes still had that salty crunch). I also didn't cover the pan when I added the cabbage in so I don't know if that made a difference.",
