I did substitute bacon bits for time sake and jalape\u00f1os for pickles because I didn\u2019t have any and I like it spicy. The result was seriously so decadent! I\u2019m not sure why the combo works, but these are the best deviled eggs. My stick in the mud husband even requested that I make them every year now. ?? Thanks for the out of the box recipe with surprisingly delicious results!! (Wishing I hadn\u2019t made another backup flavor because we devoured these! My husband claims they taste like chicken wings.)....If you\u2019re on the fence, TRY THESE!!",
