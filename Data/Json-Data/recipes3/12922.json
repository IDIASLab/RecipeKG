The entire scallop submerged in hot oil would have helped seize up the breading faster which would also prevent overcooking. Just my opinion. I do all of my deep frying outside to keep the smell out of the house but it was pouring down rain so I was forced to skillet fry. I made half of these as written but for the other half I added some Old Bay to the seasoned flour. The addition of Old Bay bumps these from a 4 star to a 5. Overall good and simple recipe and one I will definitely make again.",
