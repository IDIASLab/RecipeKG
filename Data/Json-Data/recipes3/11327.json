Next try, I forgot to list the tomato/clam juice cocktail on my shopping list, so I substituted \"Mrs. T's Bloody Mary Mix\" (which I drink by the gallon!) and cut back the horseradish & hot sauce to taste.  I loved it too, & my adult kids (after adding more hot sauce) did too!  I think I liked them both just exactly, so at least this substitution will work if you need it.  I love the mix plain, & so good for me, with low calorie count. Oh, & I served it to my kids in Margarita glasses with a small spoon!  Nice presentation, I thought.   HTH!    Blessings!",

I bought Black Tiger prawns from Costco and saut\u00e9ed them in white wine just until cooked transferred them to a bowl to let cool. I substituted one Serrano pepper for the Habanero and added one jalape\u00f1o as well. I think a 1/4 of prepared horseradish is way too much so I only added 1 1/4 tablespoons and about 20 shots of Tobasco sauce. That left the dish with a perfect amount of heat and just the right kick. I added two avocados and 1/2 a cup cilantro to add in. In hindsight I would add 3 avocados next time as I found towards the end I barely had enough of avocados and cilantro to finish the 8 I made. I added a wedge of lime to the rim of a cobalt blue margarita glass and topped with fresh sprigs of cilantro. The dish was an absolute hit and I will definitely make it again. I loved how all the flavours melded together so well. The Clamato juice I added was perfect for marinating it all.",
