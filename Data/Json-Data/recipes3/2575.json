I laid wax paper on the counter and covered and coated the steaks with the one cup unseasoned flour. I let it sit for 20 minutes turning occassionaly. I then dip the steak in milk mixture then the seasoned flour. I then let it sit on the wax paper again while heating the oil and turning it checking to see if I needed to coat with the seasoned flour which I did a little but not much. DH loved it but has always loved my deer steak. I have to say the others suggestions of letting the steak come to room temperature and sitting for 20 minutes made a big difference. Thanks for the recipe and suggestions",
