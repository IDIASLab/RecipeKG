                "reviewBody": "This is one of my husband's favorite recipes!  I changed almost everything in it, but I followed the basic outline.  I substituted ground turkey for the beef, rotini for the egg noodles, and 2 cups fat free yogurt for the sour cream (yogurt gives the stroganoff a bit more tang).  I significantly increased the garlic and worcestershire sauce and slightly increased the seasoned salt.  I left out the mushrooms and reduced the milk.  I think my changes make the recipe a bit healthier and more flavorful.  Make sure you cook the meat with the seasonings instead of adding them after you brown it so that the meat takes on their flavor.",

I used a suggestion from another stroganoff review: Date Posted: \r\n5/17/2004 Reviewed by: TARAROD\r\nMore reviews by TARAROD *****\r\n \r\nIt came out ok, but next time I will add the entire pint of sour cream. I only used half because of reviews I read and it was like putting seasoned ground beef over pasta. No sauce at all!! I also added two cubes of beef buillon to the water when cooking the pasta, and had to add 1/4 cup of milk,two tablespoons of worcestchire sauce, and 3 dissolved cubes of beef buillon to the meat mixture for flavor. I now see why some said this dish was very bland. Adding these things helped. I will make this again, but you really have to adjust the spices to make it taste good. \r\nEND OF REVIEW\r\nI would like to add:\r\nI used a pound and half of beef with a 12oz pack of noodles.  And i did use all of a 16 oz sour cream.  (But that is how our family prefers it,,, meaty for my husband and more creamy sauce for the 4 year old)  For everyone else i do suggest the rest, in addition to TARAROD's review,  I added a little onion, more garlic, Emeril's original seasoning, a bit more seasoning salt than called for and touch of soy sauce to the ground beef in the skillet.\r\n\r\nmy family rated it 4/5 stars for a stroganoff dish!",

It sure made a lot too!\n\nI added the sour cream in at the last minute and mixed it all together in a VERY large Tupperware container so it would be ready to be put into the fridge since there was so many leftovers!
