From the BBQ chicken to the Buffalo burrito, I've had them all, but they've got only one type of quesadilla. So I've decided to take one of my favorite burritos from there, the cheeseburger burrito and apply it to quesadilla form. Served with a side of fries and a Coke&reg;, it's what I call my most recent of culinary triumphs. Serve with a side of ketchup, yellow mustard, and sweet relish.",

Using 1 lb. of hamburger made four 6\" quesadillas. I didn't have any sweet relish so I cut up dill pickles. I also just squeezed some ketchup and mustard on the quesadilla which was easier for me. To knock it up a notch I did add a 1/4 tsp. of cumin to spice it up and used 6 inch homemade tortillas!",
