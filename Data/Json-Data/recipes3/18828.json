I used Olive Garden dressing for the marinade. I used previously frozen chicken breast with rib meat and they worked well. I made this recipe almost exactly as written except that we do not like ham much. Instead I used about 4 slices of bacon and chopped it up. I saut\u00e9ed it in the pan prior to adding the garlic/onions and cream cheese and other filling ingredients. My son has already asked me to make them again.",
