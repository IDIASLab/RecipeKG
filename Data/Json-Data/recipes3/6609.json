To save time toasting the bread in the toaster would work fine as would chopping the garlic in the food processor. A very good comforting soup!",

I also didn't use a chile pepper as I can't really handle spicy food, instead I added just a dash of tabasco sauce. I also added chicken meat to make it more substantial but it didn't really add anything so I won't use that next time. I used homemade chicken broth because it constitutes the main volume of this recipe so wouldn't use a storebought stock. I ended up having two servings! very nice as a starter or just a light meal or lunch. I'll definitely make it again :)",
