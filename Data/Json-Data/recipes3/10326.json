I doubt I would buy agave to make this because honey seems to me to be a better choice, agave having no flavor.  I used a coarse spicy mustard, which was what I had but I think a smoother texture would be better.  This recipe will be used again in my kitchen.  Thanks Zoodleman",

Causes weight gain(esp belly fat) heart disease & raises uric acid. Avoid completely if you suffer from gout. I love 99% of all the recipes here however I had to post this. There are many other great Brussel sprout recipes.And Brussel sprouts have amazing benefits. Please research agave nectar(syrup) before using to weigh whether the use is worth the risk",
