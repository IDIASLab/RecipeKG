Einkorn is a drier flour and takes a little getting used to but she can eat 2 of these pancakes without any problems and they are delicious! I diced up 2 very small apples and some apple pie spice. I precooked the diced apples in the microwave with a little water until they were slightly softened. Very nice fluffy pancakes and the vinegar gives a tang! I used aple cider vinegar. Thank You for a great recipe!",
