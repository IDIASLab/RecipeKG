I used a pepper to make rings, cooked the eggs in a ring topped them with tomato & served on a English muffin. They were a hit! I have continued to cook my eggs this way, just be sure to make the pepper slice with one cut so that it lays flat in the pan so the egg doesn't leak out. I have also used onion rings. 5 stars because it is so simple, easy & good.",

I added chourizo in lieu of ham for my more adventuresome friends, actually, anything works, just cut to appropriate size, and cook item ahead if needed, i.e., mushrooms, sausage, etc..",

Your success will all depend on your personal preferences re: how much you like to cook your peppers and how and how much you like to cook your eggs...not to mention such domestic engineering feats as the size of the pepper the size of the egg whether the egg leaks out under the pepper ring whether your nonstick skillet is truly nonstick ETC. I would actually like to try this again with scrambled eggs...whisking the eggs together first then pouring into the pepper rings. Then I could control the amount of egg in each! PS: I always had trouble flipping an egg without breaking the yolk until duh just the other day after cooking for more years than I care to count I sprayed my utensil with Pam before I attempted the flip!",
