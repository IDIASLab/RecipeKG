                "reviewBody": "We loved this, and we don't have any kids.  There are a few things I did differently though.  First, you MUST bake your fries for 10 mins.  This prevents them from becoming soggy and watering up your whole dish.  Second, I don't agree with the mushroom soup, because your typical cheeseburger doesn't have mushrooms.  I think that's what made others' taste \"off\".  So I substituted tomato.  As visually unappealing as it was, the combo of these 2 soups was oh so good.  I also use Campbells Healthy Request soup and lowfat cheddar because I'm on WW.  Should you do the same, you'll need to season the beef a little bit with salt, pepper and garlic powder (I have them all mixed together in a shaker.  1/2 tsp should do it.) to compensate for the lower sodium.  My husband said it was surprisingly delicious!!",

                "reviewBody": "Update:  I made this a while back and had no golden mushroom soup, so I used 3/4 cup lite sour cream.  It was delicious!  I've also used nacho-cheese soup in this recipe, and it is also great.  My family prefers tater tots to fries on this casserole, and I always bake them until they're crisp before putting them on the casserole.\nOriginal review: My kids really liked this.  They gave it a five.  I'd give it a three and a half if I could, but rated it a four because the rest of the family liked it.  I didn't change anything except adding garlic, oregano, a little worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper, but the next time I make it, I will make some changes.  For example -- next time, I'll pre-cook the fries.  Though I bought the extra-crispy version, the fries were soggy.  I'll prebake next time, and might use waffle fries instead of regular, or even the extra-crispy tater tots.  The bottom line with this recipe is that it's a plain, easy week-night meal that won't threaten your kids.  UPDATE:  I made this again last night, and the changes I made improved it vastly -- I prebaked OreIda's Crispy Battered Fries for almost thirty minutes on 425, so they were nice and crunchy.  This cut down on the cooking time of the entire dish, as I only had to melt the cheese rather than wait for the fries to bake.  I subbed nacho flavored cheese soup for the cheddar, and added a dollop (about a quarter of a cup) of sour cream to the meat mixture.  Excellent!",

I added about/more 1 1/2tsp salt 2 tsp pepper 1 1/4 tsp garlic powder to ground beef mixture and than added a dash of salt and pepper to the fries before placing in oven. End result was delicious!! We served with ketchup at table and my fussy 3 & 6 yr old's ate seconds! Must admit I was very unsure about the end result due to the odd mixtures and about all the reviews about blandness but it was very simple to make and a big time family pleaser just don't be shy with the salt pepper and garlic powder. Thanx for sharing Bettina!! Our family loves it!",
