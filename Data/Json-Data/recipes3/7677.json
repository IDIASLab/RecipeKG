Most people have never heard of it. Ours isn't an exact recipe but very similar to this one. Use fresh garden tomatoes if possible but I have made it with canned before. If you use fresh tomatoes blanch and peel them first then course chop them as they will break down some while simmering anyway. We also add chopped onions and green peppers (you can saut\u00e9 these a little before adding if you want them more tender) and some salt and pepper. I've never added cream cheese but would like to try it that way. I use what ever milk or cream is on hand. Usually don't add the milk until after the vegetables have simmered a while. Mainly because a lot of water comes out of the fresh tomatoes and I don't want it to end up too thin. I had only ever eaten it over cornbread until a friend mentioned it would be good on pasta. He was right! I love it poured over cavatappi pasta.",
