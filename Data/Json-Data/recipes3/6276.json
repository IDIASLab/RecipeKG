I had to leave out that chili pepper or my kids would not even try it but I bet it makes it even tastier. I also added a small clove of crushed garlic because garlic goes so well with eggplant and a tablespoon of lemon because I like a more sour flavor. Healthy and perfect with chicken or any meat.

I just put lots of garlic and none of the cilantro or serrano or cayenne pepper and I didn't have enough yogurt so I subbed some sour cream for the rest of the amount needed. I also added sauteed green pepper to the top of it. I liked the idea of charring the eggplant on my gas burner. It would've worked better for me if I had used medium eggplant; I just had one large and the charring didn't bake/cook it enough. I had to slice it and bake it for awhile in the oven but that worked out well. Yummy!",
