I used 1/4 tsp chipotle powder instead of red pepper flakes, and browned the chicken with the onions before adding the other ingredients to add to the depth of flavor. I held off on the spinach until the last couple minutes so that it wouldn't get mushy and disintegrate. I used about 2 cups of spinach, and will use even more next time since it cooks down so much. 30 minutes was a little longer than it needed to cook, but I really liked it anyway because some of the sweet potatoes broke down, acting as a thickener for the stew. \n\nThe flavor profile spot on -- savory, sweet, and spicy. And it looked beautiful! Both of my boys cleaned their plates. Will definitely be making this again.",

First I browned the chicken and removed it from the pot, white meat has a tendency to dry out if boiled for too long. Then I added the yams for a few minutes, then the onions, then the garlic. I added in some water to deglaze the pan, then the pepper, paprika and salt. I added enough chicken broth to cover everything, which was probably about 4-6 cups, and let that come to a boil. Reduced to a simmer until the yams were mostly done and added the chicken back in. Once everything was cooked through I added in about 3 cups of spinach right before I ladled it into bowls. Served with Paleo Biscuits, it was hit.",

I am giving 5 stars because I'd never have been able to make my own version without the basic starter recipe.   And my purpose in cooking meals is not to write perfectly accurate reviews, but to feed my family.   So,  that said, here's what I did:   I used some finely chopped celery for flavor with the onions and ginger, because I can't stomach garlic anymore, and also threw in some cumin and curry powder and cooked that a minute to release the flavor before adding the chicken broth.  Added the chicken close to the end, added a can of lite coconut milk, and  finally the spinach last, just because we don't like it cooked to death.  It was wonderful!  I'm so thankful to have a new meal to add into the rotation :)",
