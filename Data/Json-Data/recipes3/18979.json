On top of producing awesome taste and texture, the whole procedure only took a few minutes longer than the boxed stuff; not to mention we avoided about a dozen ingredients we probably shouldn't be eating. Just make sure to grate your own (high-quality) Cheddar and turn off the heat as soon as the cheese melts, and the process should go smoothly.",

The first two times I made it, my sauce broke--despite the fact that I turned off the heat when adding the cheese. The first batch,  I let sit for 3 minutes, covered. The second time, I left the lid off the saucepan for 3 minutes and it still broke. Batch #3? Victory! I pulled the pan from the heat, stirred in the cheese, transferred the batch to a serving dish and *then* let it sit, covered. I used mini shells as the pasta and the cook time was a bit longer, 10 - 11 minutes, but the amount of liquid was still fine. Oh, and I've made it using nonfat and 2% milks and all extra-sharp cheddar.",

The nutmeg adds a nice touch and I was surprised by how nice it was in this dish.  \n   Honestly I didn\u2019t add any salt to this recipe as my cheese was salty enough. If you only have 2% milk like most people, add a tablespoon of corn starch with a bit of cold water to thicken it up. \n     I\u2019ll definitely make this again but maybe experiment with other ingredients to add a bit of a twist!",
