We don't love zucchini and we sure don't love cooked carrots but we loved this. Hubs dipped his in ranch dressing but later admitted it really wan't necessary. Our motto in this house is \"brown food is good food\" so I cooked them a little longer on each side. Personal preference is all. Excellent recipe and the perfect way to incorporate some fresh veggies in your meal. 5 stars all the way! Thanks for sharing Beth S.",
