These were a little on the dry side but good flavor nonetheless. I mixed it up and had planned to make one pancake and cut it into wedges. However after I blended all of the ingredients it didn't seem like a lot of batter. I used a muffin or #16 scoop and got 11 pancakes. I liked the green onion flavor as opposed to white onion which I typically have used in these recipes. I also used 1/2 tsp. of baking powder as opposed to the 1/4 of a tsp. as it just seemed like very little for the purpose of making the pancakes rise a little. I didnt have egg product so I whisked 3 eggs and it equaled the 1/2 cup. I would rather use fresh anyhow. For the whole wheat flour I used King Arthur white whole wheat and cooked each batch in about 1-2 tsp. of corn oil. ty",
