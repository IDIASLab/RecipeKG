My changes: I use plain yogurt instead of sour cream, I use a whole pita and just fold it over on itself instead of using 2 halves (brush it with olive oil and sprinkle garlic salt), I break up the burger into chunks, and I top the gyro with lots of feta!  YUM.  Just make sure you plan ahead since some stores won't have the ground lamb.  Serve it with couscous and the Easy Roasted Red Pepper Hummus recipe on this site.  ",

If you're in a hurry you can skip the step of roasting the garlic cloves and substitute minced garlic from a jar. It seems just as tasty. Also we substitute plain/nonfat yogurt for the sour cream. Put it in a colander over a bowl for at least a half hour to drain out the liquid before use. We've found the flavor of these are even better if done on our Weber charcoal grill instead of the gas grill. Try this recipe you will love it.",
