Followed tip of another reviewer and mixed the crushed pineapple and juice with the vanilla pudding mix before folding in the Cool Whip (used lite). NOTE: Recipe states the large (16 oz.) tub of Cool Whip but unless you have a VERY deep 9x13 pan this would be waaaaaayyyy toooo much Cool Whip.",

I did make my frosting with real whipping cream as I don't care for cool whip whipped topping... and I didn't add any sugar just the pudding mix and the pineapple with it's juice and it was plenty sweet. I too found that the cake refrigerates well.. it's quite tasty today.. the day after the party. Mine was not dry at all but I kept a very careful eye on it and did not rely only on the timer to know it was done. Oh and I was feeling anxious as I was putting all the pineapple and the juice into the bowl with my whipped cream til I realized that the pudding mix would absorb the juice just fine and that the recommendation to make the frosting and refrigerate it for awhile to let it set up was a very good idea. So I did that and frosted the cake just before serving it. It was a big hit. I know that I can make this cake anytime and my family and friends will happily eat it up. Thank you for posting the recipe.",

My problem with it was that it was just \"missing\" something, I would liked it to be a bit more fruity tasting considering the ingredients and considering that it had 4 eggs and 1/2 cup oil it really didn't taste that rich. A good recipe for someone who wants to get away from the usual chocolate cake.  We will definitely use the pineapple frosting again but will pair it with a richer carrot cake rather than the yellow cake in this recipe. We do have a sweet tooth in our family so that might be the problem as this cake is quite mild - not too sweet.",
