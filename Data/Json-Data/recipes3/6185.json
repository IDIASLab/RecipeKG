EXCELLENT! nice and creamy and the topping was amazing! i used the other reviewers advice and added parmesian to the topping and i also used garlic croutons instead of ritz crackers.  THE BEST!",

So I gave it a try, and it was really very good.  The only change I made was that I didn't add the cracker crumb topping.  I sprinkled extra cheese on top before baking.  Everyone in my family loved it, and it was even better the next day!  * I will add that the butter/flour/milk/cheese mixture never did thicken on top of the stove, but it firmed up nicely while baking.

Also, I had to use cavatelli (it's what I had) but measuring that by cup left me with too few noodles floating in a sea of sauce.  I had to cook more pasta and add it to the pan.   I ended up using 12 oz. of cavatelli. I added 3 cloves minced garlic and a few shakes of cayenne to my roux, cooking for a minute or two without letting it brown, then gradually poured in warm milk and whisked it.  It comes together quickly and smoothly.  Cold milk straight from the fridge will take longer to \"sauce up\".   2% milk is fine.  Mine actually baked up and browned in less than 45 minutes so watch your oven.  When the top is brown and it doesn't \"jiggle\" too much, pull it out.   Thank you for sharing your recipe, Jody!",
