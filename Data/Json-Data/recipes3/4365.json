I used thawed pizza dough instead of french bread dough (because it was all I had). I sliced the onion very thin and didn't chop. I used soy margarine and Bac-o's (which are vegan). My husband flipped over this one! He's not vegan and he thought it was scrumptious! I was a little scared of this recipe at first but it was so easy and delicious. Beware though it is very rich! I'll definitely be making this often! Thanks for the great recipe!",

The melted butter onions and light cream mixture was so watery it didn't \"spread\" on my rolled out dough it ran off onto the baking sheet. My bacon boiled in the water with the potatoes but stayed \"boiled\" and flemsy and not crispy even after being in the oven. I think next time I will not use the potatoes and use cheese. Also the butter/cream mixture needs to be thickened somehow. But the taste was really good! It's very different! Thanks for the recipe!",
