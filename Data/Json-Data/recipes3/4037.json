Also living in Miami, there are tons of latin/south american restaurants that serve this dish. Tastes authentic, the only things I did was: marinate the meat in the vinegar and soy sauce,thinly slice hot yellow peppers add a bit of garlic and cumin. Also I've never liked how the potatoes are always soggy, so toss them in last when ready to serve the dish. I used large slices of RED onion and ROMA tomato along with cilantro, NOT parsley. One thing is this doesn't produce much juice or gravy, which is my family's favorite part to top white rice. I also serve spicy aji sauce on the side. The better cut of steak you use, the better this will be. ",

The method of cooking has a big impact on the flavor.\nHere are grandma's bulletpoints: 1) Lomo saltado is made with *lomo*, meaning tenderloin. If you can get some (I get it when it's on sale and freeze some), please use that. There's no need to marinate a good tenderloin. And don't let the juices release. Stir fry, in a wok, with HIGH heat. You want the juices to release in your plate. 2) Make sure your onions are RED. (I have small kids, so I won't say anything about the frozen fries; it's a good shortcut) 3) no need to peel or seed tomato. 4) Grandma says parsley AND cilantro. She was the best cook in the world, so she should know. 5) You add the meat back just to bring all flavors together, 30 seconds or so (you're still stir frying at high heat). Do not overcook. I repeat: DO.NOT.OVERCOOK! Your vegetables need to be still crisp. 6) Have your crispy fries waiting and add them only at the end, a split second before serving, and if possible only to the portion that you're going to eat right away or they'll get soggy.\nThere, now it's just like grandma's, that is: perfect.",

I like to use peruvian aji salsas called aji panca and aji amarillo to spice up the beef.  I just fry the salsas in oil for a bit and then add the beef to it.  You can add garlic puree too.

Unfortunately the restaurant took this dish off the menu so I was very pleased to discover it on this site and re-create it at home. As is I think this recipe is OK. If you re willing to invest a bit more time however it is a wonderful dish. 1) I ve eaten meat and chicken versions of this recipe. I find the chicken to be better. 2) Do marinade the meat in the vinegar and soy sauce for at least an hour if not several hours. The added tanginess is nice. 3) Ditch the frozen fries (does anyone really like Ore Ida?) and make your own. I agree crispy crunchy shoestring fries are best with this meal. I also season the fries with added pepper and paprika. 4) To serve either place meat with some of the marinade on top of a bed of fries or separate fries from the meat - but keep on the same plate! - so guests/family members can pick from both piles. This is good. I hope others try it despite the unusual name.",
