I mean, come on, I'm trying to save room for the tiramisu. Ricotta gives this sauce a cheesy tanginess that we don't get with heavy cream. I love to top this pasta with lots of ricotta salata, a great summer cheese.",

My family found the texture to be offputting, but I may not have thinned it enough with the pasta water. I wasn't sure what the final consistency should be. We all loved the flavor though. I reccommend cutting down the salt. I tasted it after adding the full amount and wished I could have taken half out. I ended up using some of the lemon juice to help balance it.",
