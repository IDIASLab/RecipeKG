If you want them to stay in one piece they have to be pretty thick slices. Don't cook them until they're mush. Its pretty easy to overcook the tomatoes. The other problem I saw people felt like there wasn't enough eggs. Last problem was probably just me- the spice looked to be \"too much\". So I halved it and I'm glad I did. So if you're gonna try this recipe again... I was satisfied with this: Two slicing tomatoes sliced thick half can of tomato paste 4 eggs 1/4 tsp cumin 1/4 tsp allspice salt to taste. Serves two. I'd give the recipe 5-stars if it worked out as posted. 4-stars because it requires a hella ton of fixing to make it the best!",

Next time I will try serving with rice. I will also try using at least 6 eggs instead of 4 because the ratio seemed off. I was nervous about the tomato paste at first because it wasn't mixing in but as the tomatoes cooked down more they released more juice which mixed with the tomato paste to create a sauce. I might dilute it a bit next time with some broth. My final product did not turn out like the picture - the tomatoes were completely cooked down and unrecognizable but I liked it this way. Will definitely make this again because money is tight this month...",

I made it exactly as written using sea salt and sunflower oil (which was a new ingredient to me). My cooking times were 10 minutes each time - I didn't gauge them as was hinted at but I probably should have in retrospect. The results looked nothing like the picture - they were a gloppy mess. (This lasted me for three breakfasts and the leftovers were a bit more solid.) Definitely no extra points for visual/textural appeal. On the other hand the taste was somewhat good - I like cumin a lot. I agree with a previous reviewer that the proportions were off - I would add more eggs or cut down on the tomato ingedients if I made this again. I'd probably give this a 2-star rating but I guess I'll add an extra star for taste/ease/healthiness.",
