First of all I can't even imagine making the full recipe. I cut it down to 1/3 of what's called for and that easily feeds 6-8 probably 10. Sometimes I make it just for me and my wife and we split up the leftovers among friends at work. Secondly play around with the ingredients. I started with the way it's written here but have gone through various permutations. I cut the okra. It makes the gumbo slimy. I've replaced the pork butt with chicken thighs. Added extra mustard greens. I'm thinking about trying some shrimp and/or crabmeat next time. I think that the mustard greens black-eyed peas and smoked sausages are a must but that's just personal taste. Use this as a base recipe and you'll do well.",
