I wish I knew why Americans seem to insist to add sugar or ketchup to everything even salad dressings. A nice addition would be some chopped chives and green onions. And in case anyone was wondering why dry mustard instead of prepared mustard: in addition to adding flavor it helps keep the oil and vinegar from separating.",

I'm a big fan of vinegar & oil type dressings, (especially if they don't have alot of sugar) and this was great.  I didn't have any tarragon, so I'm not sure if the effect was any different, but I did add a little cayenne for a kick, YUM!  Thanks Stephanie, I will make this again!",
