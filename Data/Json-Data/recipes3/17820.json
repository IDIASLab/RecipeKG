I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. The only modification was that I added 1/4 cup of raisins to each jar. This is a game changer. The raisins rehydrate and become plump and juicy with a nice crispness to them like when you bite into a fresh grape. Definitely one of my favorite new items to make.",
