Instead of the usual ketchup, tomato paste, and brown sugar, this meatloaf is more of an 'upscale' version of the traditional. Best served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. This is my own personal creation! I substitute ground deer meat occasionally instead of beef, only because I have a freezer full, and it's organic!",

I've made that one several times and am a fan. I did have some mushrooms to use up so thought I would try this. I halved the recipe as I only had 3/4 pound of ground beef to use. This meatloaf is much more tender than the other. I don't think there is enough blue cheese in it to really be able to taste it. I glaze all my meatloaves with a combination of ketchup brown sugar and Worcestershire. Overall we enjoyed the meatloaf and will make it again. Thanks!",
