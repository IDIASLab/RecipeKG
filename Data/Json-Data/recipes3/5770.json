I had all most of the ingredients at home already and it was really very good. Of course every cook add their own touch. I cut the stalks in half and then cut them again to open them up lengthwise. I used a white onion (that was what I had on hand) and instead of a white wine I had to use this delicious garlic vinaigrette - It was delicious. If you like your asparagus more tender than crunchy like me reduce the heat some and cover it. I shook the asparagus around frequently in the skillet with the lid on to make sure the seasoning were coating well. I added a bit more seasoning in the cooking process salt pepper and lemon pepper. Turned out great! Can't wait to make it again.",
