                "reviewBody": "Since the ingredients didn't specify frozen hashbrowns I made with freshly shredded pre-baked russet potatoes and I think it may need the frozen because my potatoes were mushy. Also there was too much soup/cream cheese topping for me but maybe it just seemed like this because I cooked in a casserole dish (3 qt I believe) like instructions stated but I think it should state that you need to use a 13x9 pan for more surface area of potato to soup mixture. Make sure to use FROZEN hashbrowns use a 13x9 pan add some seasoning to potatoes and use less of the soup mixture to top potatoes. Also make sure you use the fat free condensed soup because I didn't and I think it contributed to the oil that was at top of the finished dish.",

I made this recipe with homemade gluten-free cream of chicken soup. I also added a finely chopped white onion and some fresh garlic. Then to the soup mixture I added 1/2 cup of greek yogurt to give it a bit of tang. My family absolutely DEVOURED this - even my picky husband loved it. It made quite a large batch so I froze half to use for a later meal. Two thumbs up!",
