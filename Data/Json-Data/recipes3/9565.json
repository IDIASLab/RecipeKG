Coupled with the fact that I am cutting back on simple carbohydrates in my diet I couldn't wait to try this. Noting LilSnoo's review of the chicken not browning in the oven I chose to add pan fry this in a little olive oil and butter. Doing it that way certainly does not take a full 1/2 cup of butter and allowed it to turn the perfect golden brown I like to see in my chicken. I think it would be very good with the addition of a little garlic in the butter. I didn't have fresh Parmesan cheese so I used Romano in it's place. I served this alongside a simple garden salad topped with toasted slivered almonds and freshly grated cheese. This is very tasty recipe that I will be sure to make again.",

                "reviewBody": "What immediately caught my eye about this recipe was that it was low-carb diet friendly. I totally LOVE that almond flour is used instead of traditional breading or flour. I used a little less parmesan than called for, only because I ran out, but I thought the flavor was perfect, as were the other seasonings. I did find that they don't brown up much in the oven. They stay pretty pale-looking. I made up a second batch and stuck them under the broiler for about 15 mins, and flipped them halfway through, and those browned up nicely. I think next time I will cut back a bit on the butter, and use half egg/half butter mixture to cut back on calories. I will also set them on a grilling rack so they aren't sitting in the butter while they cook. That will help them crisp up nicely. Overall, a great recipe that I will make again and again!",

I cut back 1/4 cup on the parmesan, dipped the chicken in egg instead of butter, rolled it in the mix and saut\u00e9ed with butter and olive oil. I also like LilSnoo's idea of dipping it in a mix of egg and melted butter and broiling it. When it's crispy it is heavenly. Enjoy! 5 stars on flavor, 4 stars on original recipe.",

I cooked it in the oven at 475* instead of 375* and it browned up nicely and was cooked just right. I bought the chicken that was already precut into tenders so I didn't have to cut it up. I also didn't have any almond flour on hand so I used a wheat free gluten free coating mix I had and it turned out great. I gave it a 4/5 Because of the modifications I had to do. I would make this again with my changes. My kids liked it a lot and asked for seconds.",
