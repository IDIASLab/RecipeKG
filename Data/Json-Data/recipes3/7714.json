I love onions, but one onion to one avocado was just way too much. I would also suggest adding a clove or two of minced garlic and a little cilantro for some more flavor. When it comes to spiciness, I have a qualm with dishes that have the word \"spicy\" in them when they aren't really that spicy. Some extra cayenne and diced jalepeno peppers add a nice kick.",

Next time I am going to try this on some fish and I will try squeezing a little lime on the meat (possibly marinate in lime for 10 minutes or so) before I pat on the salt/pepper rub. Thanks for contributing this it's going in our rotation! UPDATE I tried this recipe on tilapia and now make this all the time only with fish not the chicken. Go easy on the spice layer on the fish saute/pan fry over medium to med-hi heat for 3-4 minutes each side until fish turns to solidly white. For the salsa I REDUCE the lime and onion to about 2 tsp of lime juice (1/2 a juicy lime) and 1/2 a small-medium red onion chopped fine. Yum!",

My husband and I preferred grilled onions so I cooked the chicken first, set aside, then grilled the onions, then added the chicken back to the pan.  I served it over brown rice, with the chicken and onions, then avocado mixture on top.  Really yummy and healthy, but we both decided next time I would omit or put very little lime juice. It was a bit much for our tastes.  Perhaps it was perfect with the raw diced onions. Definitely a keeper.",

It's a Salsa so I have to dice up a tomato that's been cleaned out. Salt Pepper and Garlic Powder. I then add some fresh Cilantro dried if need be. I like the lime juice but just shy of 2 Tblspns. A couple of easy stirs with a big spoon chill and serve it over the chicken. It's just the best over/with chicken. It's a bit of chopping/dicing but it's top chef praises from all who eat it.",

I agree with some other reviews that the ratio of avocado and onion seemed wrong. I had way too much onion for the garnish and had to scoop about 1 cup of it out to have a better ratio. Next time I will increase the amount of avocado or decrease the amount of onion. The second big change was adding bacon. My husband and I first thought the picture on this recipe had bacon in it...and then decided that sounded great! So we cooked about five pieces of bacon and broke it up into little pieces added it to the garnish and served. We also decided to grill the chicken (to save some time) which turned out awesome!! It added a perfect amount of salt to compliment the spice. Great dish and I will make this again!",
