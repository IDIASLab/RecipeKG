It was marvelous on the sandwiches - similar to a sauerkraut but better!",

A: They just like hot sauce or B: Something ain't right!. Tonight it was B; husband tasted it eyeballed it speculatively hot sauced it and proceeded to finish his huge serving (not with gusto--but with the grim determination of a man who knows he must eat his vegetables.) So I tasted it and lacking grim determination I could not eat mine. The ratio of salt:vegetables is too salty for me and I guess I don't much enjoy balsamic vinegar either. So I'm giving it a 3 which in my book means: May be fine for some tastes and cooking times/measurements are not blatantly wrong. Just not our thing I guess! Thank you for the recipe:)",
