I made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand and not from dissatisfaction with the recipe.\n\n- Pan spray:  I mixed all of the dry ingredients together in olive oil, applying the mixture with a basting/pastry brush.\n- Flour:  I crushed boxed stuffing cubes in the blender and sprinkled those on instead.\n\nI followed all other instructions to the letter.  Be careful of chicken juice if you are using a shallower pan like I did.\n\nThe drumsticks came out great, very tender and tasty!",

While I was prepping, I thought 'I've gotta get my hands dirty, these babies look like they need a good rub!' But opted to follow directions precisely, leaving out the poultry seasoning and subbing that with a dash of sage. I also just drizzled sunflower oil over the drumsticks, as the cooking spray I had probably would have blasted the flour and seasonings right off of the chicken and all over the walls. I was astonished at how well they turned out! I let them bake covered for 3 hours and uncovered for 20 minutes since the drumsticks I used were still a bit frosty after leaving them thawing in the fridge for 2 and 1/2 days. The excess flour in the pan made me wonder, but the juice from the chicken cooked with it, turning it into a nice broth. I'll most definitely be using this recipe again. Thank you for posting this!",
