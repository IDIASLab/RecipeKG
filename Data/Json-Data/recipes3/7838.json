We like to grill/broil whatever veggies we have on hand and eat them over rice. Last night is was basmati rice. We put this sauce over it all and it was a huge hit. My 4-year old loved it as well. I sprinkled cayenne pepper over mine to add some heat. I loved the balance of tartness from the rice wine vinegar and sweetness from the bananas and honey too.",

I really didn't love it quite like 5 stars but since I made changes on the first try I can't down-rate a recipe that I didn't follow. I added it to Costco rotisserie chicken that I cut up and simmered together for 30 mins on low. Then laddled over basmati rice. In the future I will add add either red pepper or Jalepeno to give it some kick. The family enjoyed the dish very much.",
