I used zesty pickle spears instead of slices (they retain less oil than an equal weight of slices AND it takes less time to coat and fry them all), added hot sauce to the egg mixture, and added garlic salt rather than plain to the flour.  I also tossed a couple of teaspoons of steak seasoning to the flour.  I made my husband test them before we left for the party, and he approved.  I'm glad I made two jars of pickles, but I wish I had saved one or two for myself!",

Of course they are famous for the Fried Dill Pickles. It is a cool popular place if you every get to Wisconsin. I crave these and this is a great recipe. Not the healthiest so that is the 4 star but sometimes we eat things not too healthy. I do like some panko crumbs mixed in with this (1/2 c.). It seems lighter and a different batter. They serve it with Ranch Dressing but I am going to play with a little hot sauce in it. Now I can make these at home and not have to drive 500 miles.",
