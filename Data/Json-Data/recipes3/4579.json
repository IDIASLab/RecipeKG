The size of the cauliflower head in proportion to the amount of Stilton is important as it's easy for the cheese flavor to be overpowered (which you really don't want to happen with an ingredient that expensive). Some recipes for this use heavy cream which of course is always good. I ate this with fresh homemade bread;a perfect meal.",

I used approx. 1kg cauliflower head (before the leaves and stalk were removed) and as stilton was sold out in my supermarket this evening i used 150g castello blue which isn't as crumbly - but has the same mild creamy taste as blue stilton. (I'm going to experiment with Danish blue next time);) I also used a little less pepper (I crushed 1 tsp of white and 1 tsp of black pepper corns and used about 3/4 of the total). The sherry addition really adds to the taste.:) Will definitely be reusing this one.:) update: okay i've since tried this with stilton which i find just isn't strong tasting enough and also with danish blue - which turned out to be the exact flavour i was looking for.:) so if you're a blue cheese lover danish blue's your man!:)",
