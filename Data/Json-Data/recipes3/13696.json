Made this in an Instant Pot followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using ham (Smithfield Anytime diced ham which was on BOGO) instead of turkey ham. It was a bit too thick after releasing the pressure so I did mix in more chicken stock and some of the reserved liquid from the can of corn. People have different preferences on soup or chowder texture so this is not a negative. This soup/chowder is loaded with wonderful flavor I wouldn t change a thing and most certainly I will be making this one again!",

I made it as written except I didn't have any ham but I had smoky cheddar which gave it a hint of that flavour. I gave it a good stir which broke up the potato chunks and made it nice and thick. It tasted really spicy until I added the corn and cheese then the flavour really levelled out. Do you ever keep tasting something until you've basically had an entire serving? Five stars.",

And with that being said- I was looking for a chowder recipe to make in my Instant Pot not a soup! So thankful I read prior comments- those made the difference. The recipe as written is perfect for a potato soup. The one thing I would change in the original- omit adding the extra salt with the pepper. The chicken stock & ham has PLENTY of salt to begin with! But because I wanted a thicker chowder I also added in an extra 1-2 Tbsp of flour & about 1/4-1/2 cup of heavy cream. Not ideal for the health-conscious but it made it WAY better. That also helped to reduce the overly salty taste. And next time I may use creamed corn instead of regular to cancel out adding in actual cream but I will also add in some bacon and possibly peas. I did love the generous portions of vegetables in this. Super quick & easy for the Instant Pot! The most time consuming process was chopping everything prior. The rest is a total breeze & the result was great with the couple of tweaks! Excellent comfort food & great for colder weather meals.",

Big chunks of potato in a broth is not what I like. With that said I used an electric mixer and mixed it all up. That made it more like a mashed potato mixture...so then I heated some more chicken broth/stock (because I had some left anyway) and stirred that in. THEN added the corn ham and cheese and stirred until melted. I needed to add more spices (probably since i diluted it) so I added salt pepper a little onion powder and season-all. Made some cheese toast for the side and enjoyed it! In the future I'll leave out half of the onions and carrots when blending/mixing with the mixer because I blended ALL of the chunks out and you couldn't really distinguish the onions. Overall though a great recipe that I now know how to tweak!",
