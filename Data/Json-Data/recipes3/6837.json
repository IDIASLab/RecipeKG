The children ages 2 and 4 did not like them but everyone else did. Very easy recipe and healthy. Thanks! I since tried this again planning to serve it with grilled pork tenderloin and bought nectarines instead of peaches (that is all the store had). I could not get the nectarines to split my husband even tried and we mushed up 2 nectarines so gave it up. Are nectarines harder to split in half than peaches???",

I went peach picking today and when I got home a few were bruised from being jammed in the bag so I decided to have them with dinner but how to make? This seemed perfect almost more savory than sweet a perfect accompaniment to the rotisserie chicken i picked up at the farm. I've had grilled peaches (sweet) before and loved them but this just fell flat. I really don't care for the combination of flavors at all. And there was way more than enough vinegar it was swimming in the bottom of the bowl I think you can definitely cut down on that. Oh well.",
