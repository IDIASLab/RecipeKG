                "reviewBody": "OK folks - hang on for this.  I am going to get really detailed in my review.  (I noticed when I was reading the reviews that no one really gave finite detail of how they made this) I will say that it is great, and BASTE, BASTE, BASTE.  I won't ever pay for a overpriced honeybaked ham again.\n\nOK, I had a 8 lb cooked, smoked spiral sliced ham.  I halved the glaze and had the perfect amount (but I am a very generous baster). I used (keep in mind I halved it) 1/4 tsp of ground cloves, 1/4 c of brown sugar instead of the corn syrup, 1 cup of honey and I actually did about the same amount of butter as if I made the full amount.  Now I also cooked mine in the slow cooker and it ended up a little dry, which was my fault.  If you are going to do the slow cooker, give yourself a good 5 hours on low.  I panicked with mine about 1/2 way through and upped it to high and it ended up dry.  I applied the glaze about every 25 minutes.  Make sure you keep the glaze warm and a huge tip!  Line that crock pot with foil because the clean up is a bear.  Personally, I used the new slow cooker liners and cleanup was a snap becuase you just throw the bag away.  Be sure you have a good brush too - the baste is sticky and you will end up with hair all over.\n\nThanks for sharing this recipe.  I have never made a ham before and this one was great (also great the next day - my husband and I both liked it on sandwiches).",

I used about 1/3 cup butter, 1/2 C of brown sugar, and about 1/4 honey. You could adjust these however you want easy enough. I cooked this in my crockpot with baby carrots on the bottom on high for the afternoon (Had it on high so I could lift lid and baste). I had the ham scored and cloves in it. The carrots were the best I ever had! The ham was excellant! Sooooo juicy. This my new ham recipe!",

Instead of basting it I just poured it over the ham in the bag, sealed it up and just turned the whole bag it self every 15-20 min.  I put it in a 9x13 foiled line pan but never got any glaze on it. Worked for me. I didn't use whole cloves but the ground ones. Good luck and enjoy. MMMM Good.",

I got a spiral cut ham and this made a delicious, light glaze that was wonderful on the outside but not so strong that it overpowered the meat. \n\nFollowed reviewer's advice to use brown sugar instead of corn syrup and put the ham in an oven bag for easier glazing and clean up. WOW!",
