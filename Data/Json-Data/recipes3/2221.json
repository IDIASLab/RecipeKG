I substituted 1/2 tsp. chili powder for the cumin b/c I'm not a fan of cumin. I skipped the salt. I also added a 1/4 cup of grated parmesean and a tsp. each of italian seasoning and onion powder. I highly recommend the parmesean-it added a great flavor. Next time I will try it with the sauted onions, as someone else suggested. Tasted great and will definately make again, but with the changes mentioned.",
