In Ireland, then did not eat corned beef and cabbage, it was always ham and cabbage.  When Irish immigrants moved to Boston, the jewish neighborhood was nearby. They suggested the corned beef instead, due to the fact that at that time in Boston, corned beef was much cheaper tha ham.  That is the reason for the change, however ham and cabbage is actually the Irish original recipe.",

Prior to adding any of the ingredients I saut\u00e9ed carrots onions celery and garlic in some olive oil in order to sweat them slightly (about 2-3 minutes). Then I followed the recipe as directed. The meat on the ham hock just fell off the bone and tasted so tender. It was amazing. My husband and I could not get enough. Do not pass this recipe up!",
