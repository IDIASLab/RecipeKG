Chocolate and raspberry just go together so well and I loved how the graham cracker crumbs got slightly softened from the yogurt but still added a nice texture to this parfait. I used Oikos greek yogurt. The Carnation Instant Breakfast blended well with the yogurt. I was worried it might get a little \"gritty\" but it was perfectly smooth. This will be my new guilt free breakfast or afternoon snack! Thanks Nora!",

The chocolate flavor certainly is indulgent the raspberry yogurt with the raspberries is really fresh and the graham cracker crumbs give some crunchiness and add some texture. I LUV yogurt eat it almost every day and this was a real treat. What a way to start my day!!",
