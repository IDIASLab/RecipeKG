I used about half of a large bell pepper, added approximately half a cup of fresh broccoli florets, and approximately half a cup of mushrooms. I also substituted the marjarim and thyme with approximately a tablespoon of Italian seasoning. I was a little concerned that the rice wouldn't cook thoroughly with the additional veggies. However, as mentioned previously, the pork chops were too dry and the rice was mushy. The pork chops were also bland. I didn't even leave it in the oven for the full hour and 45 minutes; cooked apx 1 hr and 15 minutes. I will use the recipe again but next time I plan to use thicker, bone in, pork chops (after marinating them) and cook for maybe 45 minutes to an hour.",
