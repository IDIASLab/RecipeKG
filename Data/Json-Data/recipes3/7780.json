(Raisins would be fine, in a pinch, but currants give more of a kick.)   I also made a whiskey sauce to top the pudding when serving.  (1/2 c butter, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 c heavy cream, 1/4 c whiskey: heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Done. Super easy and great on bread puddings.)  I made this pudding for Christmas dinner and could not have chosen a more perfect dessert.  Everyone loved it.  I will be making currant and cardamom bread pudding for years to come... THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE :)",

Not your typical dessert.  I made my own apple syrup from a recipe that I found on the internet using apply jelly.  (Couldn't find apple syrup at the store.)  Found dried currants at the local health food store in the bulk section.  It is worth the effort to make this dessert.",

I had some for dessert and I going to try some more in the morning with \"black coffee and solitude\". If I was serving this to company I might serve it with a very light vanilla sauce jut to dress it up a little. The bread I used was Hot Cross buns that I had frozen from Easter - they already had currants in them but I still added more as per the recipe. Thank you to the poster - this was a real treat. Serving size is very accurate in this recipe",
