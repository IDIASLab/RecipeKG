Oh yeah I also used baby bella mushrooms as they cost the same as regular white mushrooms and I prefer the flavor. I served this over angel hair pasta with a side of asparagus sauteed in oil soy sauce garlic jalapenos and sesame seeds. Overall the dinner was delicious! My lovely lady enjoyed it so much that I renamed it \"Stepher's Chicken.\" (sorry KJ:) Thanks for the great recipe!",
