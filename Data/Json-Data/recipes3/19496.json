To save time though, I suggest rolling the noodles out into desired thickness, and then rolling the dough into a log.  Then starting at the end, slice the noodles into desired width.  Afterwards, just toss them around until they are all uncurled into noodles.  Will save you a ton of time from just slicing them while lying flat.  Also keeps them more uniform in shape.",

I add poultry seasoning when making noodles for chicken soup, and add garlic powder & basil when making noodles for use in Italian dishes. And for the occasional kid-friendly treat I divide the dough into 2 to 4 batches, and add a different food color to each batch. Serve cooked noodles with butter -- and watch the children go wild. (Haha. Children are so easy to please.) I can offer some insight to making great noodles: Don't add baking powder, as some folks have suggested, unless you like a really thick (more dumpling style) noodle. Working the dough too much, and not adding butter or oil will result in tough, rubbery noodle. Divide the dough into batches, and roll each batch. This helps in rolling the noodles very thin. The thinner the better (unless you're making chicken & dumplings). Happy cooking!",
