Don't be scared by the amount of honey, I started out with only 1 tbsp and after the first slice quickly added the other tbsp.  They were not too sweet at all.  I used light bread and half&half instead of heavy cream.  They came out great.  You have to cook them at a low heat because of all the honey or they will burn quickly.  Definitely a keeper.",

Our sons are huge Batman fans so I used a bat-shaped cookie cutter instead of a star and they loved it!  For bread I used Best Bread Machine Bread from this site, it had just come out of the bread maker and worked out wonderfully for this recipe.  I don't know if it's the difference in using heavy cream in place of milk as in traditional recipes, or the addition of honey, it just was a terrific recipe-unlike any I had ever had before.  Thanks so much for sharing, I can attest that this will be our permanent French Toast recipe from here on out!",

I used day-old Hawaiian bread cut in sticks (they were leftover from the dip last night for the Superbowl) and it was great! I fried them in a thin layer of vegetable oil and they were perfect. I like to sprinkle the cinnamon on while cooking to get it more evenly distributed. These tasted like restaurant quality french toast sticks! Yum!",
