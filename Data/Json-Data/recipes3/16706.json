Pour all drippings (butter, seasonings, etc) into a narrow container and set aside while you begin the pasta, let the mixture separate, and pour off the fat before adding to  the pasta.  Otherwise this would end up a greasy fatty mess. Everything else was perfect and the flavor was great. (ps, use fresh spinach)",

It will be your new favorite go to and likely your children's favorite meal memory as well.",
