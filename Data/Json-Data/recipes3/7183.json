(I don't do this, as I make my own mayonnaise for health reasons, as follows...)\n\nHEART HEALTHY VERSION: use extra-virgin olive oil (organic if you can find it), and organic, free-range eggs.",

I used Canola oil, less oily taste to it, and added 1 TBS sugar.  I ended up only using 1 1/4 c oil and it was getting so thick I had to stop.  The first time I was pouring the oil in by hand...very, VERY slowly, talk about a tired arm!  The second time I got smart and poked a hole through a paper cup with a toothpick and let the oil slowly drizzel out of that (I took out the little thingy on top of the blender lid and set the cup up there :)  Very good will make again!",

I have used my trusty Bamix since 1986 with outstanding results on this and many other recipes; 3. Be sure that the egg is the first ingredient added, followed by the vinegar (I use 1/2 red cider vinegar & 1/2 lemon juice), seasoning (I use 1/4 tsp to 1 C canola oil and the same amount of dry mustard as my mustard of choice), into a tall, narrow plastic cup (Halve the recipe for this method). Hold the blade on the bottom of the cup, turn it on to the fast speed for 20 seconds then move up & down slowly until completely mixed. Takes less than a minute, start to finish for delicious, homemade mayo! Other tips: Add finely minced chives, basil, cilantro, etc., or paprika or other spices ~ be inventive and enjoy. * * * This recipe tastes even better than Best Foods/Hellmann's mayo. We never have to buy pricey mayo. Once you try it, you may feel the same.",

Also, if you have a stick blender, put everything into a wide mouth jar, place your stick blender all the way to the bottom and turn it on.  Wait for a second until it starts to emulsify at the bottom and then slowly pull the blender towards the top.  By the time you get there, you'll have mayo right in the jar that you'll keep it in!
