It's a hearty breakfast/brunch that is easy to put together and sure to please!  I have found that I need to bake the casserole almost twice as long as the recipe calls for otherwise the eggs don't set up and the center is runny and pretty disgusting.  Bake it till the eggs set in the middle and the edges are lightly browned.  Then I let it sit on the counter for about 10 minutes before serving and you are in for a devine breakfast.  I serve with a fresh fruit salad and OJ.  YUM-YUM-YUM!!!!",

While the sausage is cooking, mix the eggs, milk, and cheese together and let it sit.  The cheese seems to \"absorb\" quite a bit of the liquid so that when you pour the whole mixture over the crescents, it's thick.",
