I leave my meat in marinade over night or all day, but no longer. If you leave it too long the meat texture changes and gets \"mushy\". And don't try to save calories by omitting the oil. Your meat will turn out dry. I don't have an outdoor grill, so I grill in my G Foreman grill. For room temperature meat and 1\" thick meat, I cook for 6 minutes on preheated grill. Perfect medium rare, tender & juicy!",

At first I was put off a bit by the slightly sweet flavor of the balsamic vinegar. When I was on my last bite I was thinking this is a great flavor. For the outside grill though 1/3 cup of olive oil made the grill flare up and the steaks were well marbled so I would not use that amount of olive oil again. DS is not a mustard fan so I cut back on the mustard a bit and I totally forgot to add the liquid smoke (didn't miss it due to the outside grill). Other than that it was a nice change from our usual steak dinner. Thanks for the idea!",
