I used butter-flavor Crisco\u00ae and the bread crumbs, and  both worked great. This is exceptionally sweet and rich, so you really do want to cut into small pieces. I assembled this up to the point where you drizzled the sweetened condensed milk over the top.  I had two cans on hand, opened the first, and it had solidified.  Opened the second, and it also had solidified.  Both were well beyond the \u201cbest by\u201d date (I don\u2019t bake a lot), so both went into the trash.   I had some coconut cream in the fridge which is the same consistency as the sweetened condensed milk, so I used that.  We like pecans better than walnuts, so I did make that substitution.  This needed to sit for a while to firm up, and although very good, just too sweet for our personal taste.",
