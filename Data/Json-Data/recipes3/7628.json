                "reviewBody": "The recipe sounded good, after reading review I went to the kitchen and made it, its not even dinnertime yet!  Five stars WITH my adaptions.  The milk concerned me as far as too watery, so held off on that, and did not need any.  The dill was an interesting addition, it was good with and without it.  My potatoes came to about 1 1/4 c dry mashed (they were pretty small potatoes), I used 6 T butter, my peppers were a combo of red, green, yellow, orange, totaling 1/2 c, I held off the cheese, used one egg and added 1/2 t each garlic salt, onion pwd, dried dill and 1/4 t pepper, dash or two lemon pepper. Rest of the recipe was the same. Directions I followed as is, adding butter from pan in with veggies and no milk was needed, almost too much butter.  I test cooked two, one I added a good pinch of mixed blend cheese, the other without, both were awesome!  This is as close as I've come to recreating a crab cake I got years ago at a restaurant I've tried recreating many times since so I'm very glad I tried it!  I wouldn't want to use more potatoes, so milk would not be necessary unless you had a lot more potatoes in there. They would help stretch the final amount.  Add any liquid after mixing rest together, only add if you need it to help form patties.  That will really depend on how dry your potatoes are when you mash them.",
