I added some evaporated milk to the pureed pumpkin and then to the sauce at the end to thin it out a bit and made it a bit more creamy.  Delicious on rice.  I used jalapeno (seeds and all), since I didn't have the chile pepper. . . had a nice kick to it.  Next time I think I'll add some red pepper to the sauteed vegies, as well, and maybe some fresh chopped cilantro on top.  Would also be good made with chicken.  Thank you for the recipe. . . great way to use some of our leftover pumpkin from Halloween.",

I used thawed butternut squash from my freezer instead of pumpkin. Used less coriander. Used less peanut butter because I thought it would overwhelm the other ingredients but it didn't. Strong orange juice flavor. Used less ham because I'm not a big meat person. Could cut out the ham entirely and it would be a delicious vegetarian dish.",

                "reviewBody": "Yumly! Had no peanut butter on hand so ground up some almonds into paste instead (actually had to add some oil to get our weak grinder to make it into 'butter'). The satay was a bit thick (maybe because of the almond 'butter'?) so we added a little broth from the soup I served alongside this satay. That did the trick wonderfully. Did decide to cook the satay a little longer because the pumpkin flavor was still obvious as an aftertaste until it was cooked longer and hubby does NOT like pumpkin... That also worked very well even by his standards! Only had a jalapeno pepper on hand so sub'd that. Also had no coriander seed so sub'd a little extra cumin along with a bit of fennel seed and caraway (as per suggestions which came up via an internet search). I'm one to add a touch of sugar and/or salt to balance out seasonings & did so here. My youngest two children (young teens) both enjoyed this a great deal our youngest son in particular. My husband who claims to hate pumpkin is pretty impressed with the fact that a surprising number of the pumpkin items we have tried from this site have been enjoyable. This might not be his first pick in dinners but he'd never turn it down. He would have even enjoyed seconds if the kids hadn't eaten it all up before he got to it. Thanks Hushai! This is going in my cookbook though I'm likely to add in some fresh spinach at the end both for nourishment and color. I might also top this with defrosted peas for the same reason.",
