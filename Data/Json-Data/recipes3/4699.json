Also I should have known better on the measurements of other ingredients. Amounts of oil and vinegar should be flip-flopped--three parts oil to one part vinegar. As written and especially if you use a well-aged balsamic as I did this was much too sweet. Finally the garlic--ohhhh the garlic--I'm reeking of it an hour after I've eaten it and I believe I'll still be tasting it and my pores oozing of it tomorrow. This was garlic overkill--and I LOVE garlic. This is a recipe that effectively takes a combination of perfect ingredients and totally ruins it. I should have used common sense.",
