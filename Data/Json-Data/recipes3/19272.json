Instead of dissolving the corn starch in water, I dissolved it in milk. This made the gravy nice and thick and creamy. It was delicious and there was no odd texture or appearance to mine as other reviewers have stated. I definitely recommend using milk instead of water as it really gives it a nice color and appearance.",

It was sort of gloppy but the taste was good. I'll make it again in a bind Thanks Barbara.",
