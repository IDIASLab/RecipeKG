This recipe has TONS of potential-- Loved the curry/cinnamon/apple mix. Non fat Greek yogurt added a perfect consistency without the fat. Plan on making it again soon and KNOW it'll be at/near a five star meal!!",

I also used madras curry powder because Indian-style curry paste isn't sold in our grocery store (although Thai-style is). The flavors all worked really well together and the apples were a nice variation. Even my three-year-old liked it. The one suggestion I have is to add the broth and simmer then remove from the heat before adding the yogurt. Yogurt curdles when it's heated; still tastes fine just looks sort of unappetizing. Other than that this is easy delicious and healthy; we'll have it again! Thanks!",

It worked so well that my partner said it tasted better than some restaurant dishes.",
