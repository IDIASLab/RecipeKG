I did add some Nicoise olives (cuz we love them) but no other changes. Thanks so much for sharing this great dish! UPDATE: This is one of those recipes that is so versatile because you can use whatever pickled or marinated vegis that you have on hand. Tonight.....golden fingerlings marinated artichokes papadews & gigante beans. Kalamata olives and some green ones too. LOVE this recipe for simplicity and fresh flavors. Using up leftovers in my frig are the bonus! Thanks again for sharing!",
