Pulled out my old air popper for the first time in ages not sure how much poped popcorn I had about 6-8 cups (1/2 cup unpopped)it was perfect. I had no problem with the balls keeping shape I just used lots of butter on my hands and took from the top of the pan (cooler) shaped in to palm sized balls and set on wax paper to set up. Thanks! I think I will make a green batch to go with it for neighbor treats!!",
