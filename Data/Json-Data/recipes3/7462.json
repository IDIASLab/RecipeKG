I didn't use the broth because of the excess liquid issue and it intensified the flavors. Excellent recipe either way.

They \"slide\" right out of their outer-layers this way so that was a great tip. I used a pkg of bone-in/skin-on thighs and drumsticks since my family loves dark meat in a stew. I used a bit more tomato sauce (chunky style with herbs) and I used 3 heaping Tbsp of minced garlic and a lot more Oregano than what it called for b/c we like more flavorful dishes as well. Used lots of chopped fresh parsley too. Also added a container of fresh white mushrooms halved. The results were good! Meat totally fell off the bone and the flavors were great. My husband didn't care for it but that's because I put it over Batsmati rice which was sticky and mushy. I think over egg noodles would be better next time. Thanks for sharing!",

I didn't have shallots so I used very thickly sliced up onion and didn't blanch them first. I also didn't use near the oil called for but I did use more than I normally would-prob. close to 1/4 cup. I didn't have any parsley but I added a bunch of fresh marjoram and a little fresh oregano. At the end I thickened it up with a little cornstarch slurry. Served it with rice and salad.
