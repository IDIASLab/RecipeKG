These are very good but I made them the way my dad did.  I did a double batch and used 1 cup of beer (rrom temo) and 1 cup warm water.  Did not use milk.  Also only used 1 cube of yeast because of the beer.  He also made it and let it rise all night and made them in the morning.  I have done this tradition with my kids since my dad has passed and hopefully they will carry it on.  ",

A few tips - one package of active dry yeast works the same as the fresh yeast, and I also reduce the salt to 1 tsp.  I like to do have the batch with cinnamon mixed in with the powdered sugar.  Make sure to finely chop the apples - they should only add flavor, not a lot of texture.  Lastly, the balls need to be at least golf ball size - so use an ice-cream scoop to drop them (gently) in the oil.",
