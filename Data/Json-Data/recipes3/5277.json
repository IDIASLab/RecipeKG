Since it is in bite size pieces, it is cooked perfectly when the garlic and onions are done. I put in the juice from the tomatoes and you have more liquid for your rice. (If you have homegrown tomatoes, you can use those too)I don't oil the casserole dish, I just drizzle the top with olive oil. You cook it for about 30 minutes, then you add the cheese on top and cook an additional 10 minutes to melt the cheese. If you have a clay dish, that is what they use to cook it in, in Turkey. Hope you like it, we love it!",
