I grilled the chicken breast, slice them thin and set aside. I also cooked the bacon along with the shallots, then added garlic.

We were only cooking for 3 people, so we cut the recipe in half for starters (using only 1/2 lb of linguini).  We cut the bacon into small pieces and browned; about halfway through the browning process, we  added a half a large  onion, diced (it could have used more though).  Once the onion was cooked and a bit caramelized, we added 1 clove of garlic, minced (should have used 2 cloves).  We cooked that together just until the garlic was fragrant and meanwhile we cooked the pasta.  In a small bowl, we whisked together 2 eggs, 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup whole milk (we didn't have any cream on hand), 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg and pepper.  Once the pasta was done cooking, we added it to the pan with the bacon and onions, piled it up high and dumped the egg mixture on top.  Working quickly we folded the egg mixture into the pasta so as not to cook the eggs.  Once thoroughly mixed, we removed it from the heat, tossed in some fresh flat leaf parsley and ate it (topped with more fresh parmesan and pepper).  It was very tasty and we will make it again (with my suggestions) for sure.",

When the onions were almost done added 3 crushed cloves of garlic and a couple tablespoons of chicken broth. Used 3 eggs instead of 4 egg yolks and whipped them into 1 and 1/2 cups of heavy cream. Then when pasta was done I tossed it with the onion/garlic mixture and added the cream/egg mixture to it, cooking and tossing until it started thickening. Then I added 1 cup of parmesan and 1/3 cup mozzarella and tossed. Then seasoned it with a little nutmeg, black and cayenne pepper, and salt.",
