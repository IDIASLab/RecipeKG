Secondly you really have to run the stuffing mix through a processor so that it turns to crumb or its not going to work either. Lastly this is extremely wet and takes more than 10 minutes to set up in the fridge. These turned out okay but you really have to allow more time and effort than the recipe states. If I make these again I will leave out the milk altogether. Great concept but these need some tweaking.",
