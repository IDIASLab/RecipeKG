I've made it I don't know how many times now and I think I've got it down to perfection for my family so here are my changes for anyone interested!:) I don't like it with small shell pasta; it's better with something larger bow-tie or even egg noodles. And I add a bunch of FRESH chopped basil to the pasta. Yum. I add chopped onion in the pan with the garlic. I double dip the chicken piece because it does get a bit soggy. I do not add the tomatoes. Takes away from the lime flavor I think. I lOVE the limes with the chicken- absolutely delicious. I top it off with a mound of shredded mozerella. We LOVE IT!!! Thanks!",
