Use the grease to saute the onion.  Proceed with the recipe.  Reason:  If you want the bacon to add color, flavor and crisp texture to the dish, fry it and sprinkle it over the top at the end.  If you cook it with the moist onion, it will not get crisp.",

The dish turned out good with the change in noodles, but I think it would've been fantastic if I'd been able to use the \n correct noodles, linguini.",
