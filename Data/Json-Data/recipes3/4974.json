While I thought it would be an okay accompaniment, I had no idea it would be the hit that it was. Everyone who tried it ended up getting seconds. My husband voted it \"a keeper\"; he just asked that I saute' the onions a little longer next time as he's not a big fan of crunchy onions, preferring them softer.\n\nI only made one change to this recipe and that was to use frozen corn, which I \"nuked\" to thaw out before adding it to the other ingredients waiting in the skillet. The only reason was that it's not \"corn season\" yet, and I was too impatient to wait that long to give it a try.",
