Scrumptious and satisfying.Brought the calories down to 291 per hearty serving (1/8 of 8x8 pan) and only 8 grams of fat. I loved the bechamel with the beans and tomatoes. Who would have thought?AAA",

I was amazed at how much I loved it.  It's not heavy at all; such a nice change from many vegetarian lasagnas that are super cheesy and rich.  This will be a definite favorite from now on.  I made 2 and froze one for later; am so glad now that i did!\n\nThe only slight complaint was that it was a bit runny and didn't hold together very well; although this improved significantly once it had sat for several minutes.  It may have been because I used petite diced tomatoes as they tend to have more liquid.  Didn't matter-we ate it right up!\n\nThank you for this great recipe!",

Not the recipe's fault but the lessons I learned from this: Use as deep a dish as you can and don't fill it to the top; try not to assemble this ahead of time. I had to let this sit on the counter for a bit after assembling the whole thing: hot bean mixture white sauce cheese and all and there were consequences. I had puddles of yellow all over the top of my lasagna by the time I put it in the oven mostly butter from the bechamel sauce I think. I had to pat the top dry after it cooked for a while - even with a pan under the dish there was butter overflow and things got smoky. The gruyere cheese is expensive and given this expense I expected more of a taste payoff. If I make this again I might try for a less pricey cheese with a similar texture & a bit of a stronger taste.",

And this one turned out to not be nearly as heavy as I expected. I used fresh basil and some extra bell pepper and combined with the Gruyere the flavors really popped. When I make this again (and it'll definitely be soon!) I do plan on doubling the beans and tomatoes because I like my lasagna a little thicker. But otherwise this was absolutely delicious:D",
