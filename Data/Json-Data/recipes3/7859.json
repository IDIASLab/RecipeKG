I love corned beef and cabbage out of the crock pot but always have lots of leftovers because I do corned beef, cabbage, carrots & potato's that being said I just took everything out of the crock pot and put in a strainer then chopped the corned beef and transferred to a casserole dish coated with cooking spray. I made the topping as stated and put in the oven the next night and it was totally awesome!! Thank you for the idea!! :-)",
