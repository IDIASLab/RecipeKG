I tripled the dressing only because I made it according to recipe and it wasn't near enough. I also didn't cook it I just whisked it in a small bowl and drizzled it over the salad. This was okay not our favorite. I think this would be better with fresh spinach and tomatoes without the rice. The dressing suited the fried chicken really well though.",
