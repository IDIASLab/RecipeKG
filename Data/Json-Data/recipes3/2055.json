That's how I always do my chicken! I used 2 tlb of the oil from the sundried and 1 tbl plain olive oil to sautee the garlic. I made 1/2 c chicken broth and poured a bit at a time in the pasta to keep moist. To the chicken I added crushed red and sliced artichoke hearts. This tasted exactly like a dish I get at a local Italian Restaurant! Just awesome.",

Don't change the ingredients, but I do have a few tips for easy prep: I double this, and put the chicken, sun-dried tomatoes and SDT oil, and all remaining ingredients (except parm and noodles) into 2 large zip lock bags.  I throw 1 bag in the fridge until I'm ready to cook it in the evening, and the other bag goes into the freezer. When I go to make this meal again in the future, I pull out the frozen bag and thaw it which also marinates the meat a the same time.  I heat a pan, dump it in, and it's done even before the noodles!!",

Between the colorful pasta and the pretty herb bread that was a quick braided loaf it was a beautiful presentation. Thanks Cindy.",

A little more oil is better as it is a particularly dry dish. Enjoy the flavours!A",
