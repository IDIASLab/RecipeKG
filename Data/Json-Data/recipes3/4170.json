Toasted pine nuts (didn't have hazelnuts) in a dry skillet while the carrots cooked.  Added light butter, the carrots with juices, and honey (only 4 tsp based on reviewers' comments).  Warmed together in the skillet for about a minute--9-10 minutes total time from start to finish.  We loved this.  Think it will go on the Easter menu.",
