I totally suggest using the Island Pepper Company Island jerk seasoning as your jerk paste. It's the best paste you can buy and is superb. I like grilling my chicken but I chose not to. For the chicken I took two boneless chicken breasts with jerk seasoning (3-4 tablespoons rubbed in) cooked them in a skillet with a tablespoon of olive oil until almost cooked. After that I cut the chicken into strips and cooked until some browning occured. Then mixed all the pasta egg noodles into the sauce with the chicken to follow. Simmer in the pan for 5 minutes and you have yourself a treat. If you have ever eaten at Bahama Breeze this recipe mocks thier Jamaican Jerk Chicken. The key is the Jerk Paste... Try to find the Island Pepper Co. paste.. You will be totally satisfied. I blew myself away with the recipe. You should also try bowtie pasta for an awesome presentation..",

To add body to the pasta sauce I made a simple white roux and added it to the sauce.\r\nThanks for the recipe!!!",

I increased it to 2 c. chicken stock, 1 cup wine and 1 cup heavy cream.  In addition I used a jerk rub plus a simple jamaican marinade I found in the salad dressing aisle.  I prefer to bake the chicken so that it's nice and juicy (350 for approximately 25 minutes).  This was a crowd pleaser and the pasta was enough to easily feed 6-7 people, just use  more chicken.  ",

I couldn't believe myself and Im not the most experienced cook around....The only thing I did was saute slices of raw chicken in the olive oil garlic and jerk paste until cooked...Took that out then added the ingredients minus the chicken stock and upped the lime juice since I feel Jerk can be to spicy lime juice tames it down. Let that cook together for a bit then added lots of cream but DID bring to a boil to thicken some added penne pasta the cooked chicken heated well and added a bit more lime juice and it was perfect!!!! I recommend making it extra saucy and serving with a really good french bread toasted with garlic butter spread GREAT for dipping.",

I gave this one 3 stars because the taste was good but the sauce never thickened up as it should have done. It was very runny. I made it a second time and made the following modifications which helped: Use about 1/4 cup of the chicken stock increase cream to 1 full cup and leave out the lime juice altogether. Also used penne pasta rather than egg noodles. Also served with garlic bread (french bread with butter and minced garlic). Even at that I still had to thicken the sauce with a cornstarch paste. I cannot find the jerk paste so I made some with McCormicks Carribbean Seasoning add a little oil soy sauce and apple cider vinegar to the spice to make the paste.",
