I am not trying to be mean but the tomato is just too much and it completely drowns out the flavor of the curry. The tomato needs to be cut in half and definatly add more curry powder I added twice as much and still could barely taste it! Those who wrote that they normally don't like curry but liked this dish obviously liked it because it's not a curry dish. It's good if it were supposed to be a creamy tomato dish but it's just not curry at all. Those who truly like curry I don't reccomend this you'll be disappointed. It did have a unique and zesty flavor so go into this not antisipating a taste of curry but a zesty tomato flavor kind of like a creamed marinara.",

I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the curry (since I was using regular curry powder) and halved the tomato sauce (since others complained the tomato sauce dominated the dish too much). Sadly this didn't help enough; the tomato sauce was still the strongest flavor in the dish and the next more distinctive was the cinnamon (then came the curry). This didn't have a flavor I liked and certainly not a distinctively curry one. I much prefer Indian Tomato Chicken recipe (for a spicy tomato-based Indian recipe) and Indian Chicken Curry II recipe (for a true creamy non-tomato-based curry recipe) on this website.",

Here are some modifications I make:\r\n1) I double the curry powder.  (I use regular supermarket curry powder.)  I do like the taste of curry to really come out, and I tend to like things spicy (though not so spicy that you can't taste the actual food).\r\n2) I use diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce (since I remember one reader saying that the tomato sauce overwhelms the taste of curry.\r\n3) Can't be bothered w/ whole cloves, cinnamon stick, etc.--I just use a pinch or two of cloves, cardamom and cinnamon.\r\n4) If you are on a diet, substituting plain nonfat yogurt for the coconut milk works great--just don't overheat so the yogurt doesn't curdle.",

                "reviewBody": "This curry lacks the punch of using individual spices roasted and ground at the time of preparation (the use of curry powder and not individual spices). It is far from being a bad curry but preground spices or mixed ground spices such as curry powder are beyond their prime and mostly dried out. All curry powder suffers so which is why thiss dish does not leap out at you and the aroma is restrained rather than alive. Curry powder is not an ingredient normally seen in most Indian kitchens. It is in none of the kitchens of my Indian or Pakistani friends. This essentially makes it Indian curry for people who are not Indian. Olive oil is not used in India neither. Try unsalted butter or ghee. However I will say it is a good recipe for novices exploring South Asian style cooking but as your knowledge grows learn the individual spices and move on from curry powder. I substituted an equal mix of cumin seed (pan fired and pulverized) corriander (pulverized but not fired) a pinch of turmeric some cayenne (to taste) for the curry powder and this recipe took on real life. Leave everything else the same. Bone in chicken is essential for the flavour deboned breasts dry out. Thighs are good too with this and more flavourful.",

After making this recipe the first time I learned a very valuable lesson. Get all of the spices at an Indian market. For example cardamom cost $12 at the grocery store and you only get a very small amount it cost a $2 at the Indian market and you get a whole bunch. I also added a couple of serranos peppers as I wanted it hotter!!!",

For the cardomom cloves & cinamon- the recipe would be better followed as written however... I only have powdered spice on hand so I use 3/4 to 1 tsp of each..it is still very good. thanks for an awesome recipe",
