These are just right with just the right amount of spice. My husband likes nuts in his oatmeal cookies so I added some chopped walnuts and increased the amount of raisins a little and he loved them. I use a cookie scoop to put them on the baking pan and the first sheet took a long time to bake and didn't spread much so the second batch I flattened with a spatula and they were just right and took less time to bake. I will use this again and again! Thanks for the recipe.",
