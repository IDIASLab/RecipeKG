Suggestion: Spread the soft garlic cloves on some crusty bread, like butter. The flavor is not overpowering!",

I cut chicken breast (with bone and skin) in half and I don't measure the white pepper. I seasoned the chicken with the white pepper first and set it aside while I prepared the other ingredients. In order to peel the garlic easier I boiled water in a sauce pan and dropped the heads of garlic into the water and let it sit for 1 minute. Then I removed the garlic and peeled it. This is a wonderful recipe!!! Excellent!!!",

Cutting the amount of garlic in half may work however the overall dish would be nothing special. Don;t expect this one to be the cure-all for your left-over thigh blues.",
