I used rice krispies instead of the chocolate puffs they are small enough that you can leave them whole and not crush them they were the perfect flavor and consistency. Next time I would mix the peanut butter and corn syrup together first. That would make the peanut butter a lot easier to mix in with the cereal. I put it in a 9x13 pan and froze it before adding softened ice cream and freezing again for another hour.",
