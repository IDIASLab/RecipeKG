I added the following (because I had it on hand): 1/2 (of each) red, yellow and orange bell pepper, chopped, fresh spinach (handful), fresh basil (2 Tablespoons), fresh Italian parsley (2-3 tablespoons), 3/4 cup of cherry tomatoes quartered, sauteed 1/2 red onion and two big garlic cloves in a little olive oil, used light sour cream instead of the oil (1/2-3/4 cup), sprinkled it with some olive oil, used Heart Smart Bisquick, egg beaters, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, baked it for 45-50 minutes in 350-degrees using a glass pyrex dish (10X13, I think).  It looks beautiful and tastes really great! What a wonderful way to get a bunch of healthy veggies in your diet.",

As menioned in other reviews, I shredded the zuchinni, carrot and onion. I used cherry tomatoes which I cut in half, and it made the pie very colorful. I also sprinkled cheddar cheese on top which enhanced the overall appearance. I used Italian seasoning in place of the marjoram which worked well. Next time I will use less oil.
