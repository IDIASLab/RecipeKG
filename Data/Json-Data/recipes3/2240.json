The only thing I don't agree with is the amount servings. One recipe will feed my husband, my son and myself, along with a sandwich or burger, without a drop left. Also, I know it says that the cheese is optional, and I suppose it is. However, I used aged sharp white cheddar. Oh my, that is good. I also grated the onion on my cheese grater instead of chopping. That way we get the flavor of the onion and my son can't find them! Tonight we added some chopped cooked chicken and cooked pasta for a complete meal. I used to make a more complicated broccoli soup, but this one has replaced it!",

Made 2 batches--1 with oregano and Mexican 4 cheeses from Kraft--the other no oregano and cheddar. I tried each batch before putting in the cheeses. My opinion is 1) you need twice as much broccoli as the recipe calls for 2)cheese is a must 3)the amount of oregano was negligible. I preferred the oregano/Mexican chhese but both were good. I will use this recipe again only with my alterations!!!",

The milk I used was fat free evaporated milk which made it creamy and thickened it up on it's own. I just added enough to give it a \"creamy\" look. This was very good--the cheeze was just enough to give it a nice flavor without going overboard. My husband even commented that it was good and he's not much of a soup eater. Next time I think I'll puree the broccoli/onion with the chicken broth before adding the other ingredients and I'll add fresh minced garlic.",
