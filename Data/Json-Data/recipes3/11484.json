I used red pepper instead of green- personal taste. I didn't double the onions nor the beans as I was going for more of a tomatoey taste.  Doubled the turkey, diced tomato, tomato sauce, basil, garlic. I had enough to share w co-workers the following day, and the family at home. So delicious! Ate it with shredded Mexican blend cheese, dollup of sour cream and leftover toasted hamburger buns- the way to go!! Will definitely make this often!!",

Better leftovers.\" I really expected this chili to be dull due to it not having cumin or oregano along w/ so little chili powder so I tasted it at the halfway point and it was great... even better when we served it that evening but even BETTER the next day. Followed the recipe exactly as written even neither draining nor rinsing the beans which I always do. W/ cheese sour cream and Fritos it will surely become a family favorite.
