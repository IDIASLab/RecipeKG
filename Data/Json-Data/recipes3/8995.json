I forgot to put the pecans in at first but added them after we ate half of it.  It tasted almost the same with or without them. I liked it a little better without though.  My husband couldn't really tell either way. I followed the recipe exactly other than that and it was nice and refreshing.  I will definitely be making it again!",
