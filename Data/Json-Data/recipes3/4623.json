Instead of preparing the mashed potatoes in advance, saut\u00e9 the onions and celery in a large saucepan, then when they begin to soften, add the milk and water etc. according to the instructions on the mashed potatoes (I use chicken broth, not plain water) Bring to a boil, and stir in the potato flakes. Then you can stir in the rest of the ingredients right into that same big pot. It saves you a step, and extra dirty pots/pans. (I also add poultry seasoning to mine)",
