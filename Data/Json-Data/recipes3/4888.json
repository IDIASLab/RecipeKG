You can really make it your own depending on what kind of chutney you use (I like peach or mango) and how hot you want it. Good tip of toasting the curry powder before adding he oil to saute the chicken breast. Makes the flavor even better. All I did was add maybe a clove of minced garlic - but otherwise it was good without any tampering. Now I don't have to spend the big bucks for this sandwich down the street......... LOL",
