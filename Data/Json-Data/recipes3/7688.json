The sugar allows for bits of cabbage to get slightly caramelized. I always cooks the noodles al dente and add them to the cabbage to get a little caramelized themselves.  Often times I add some chopped LEEK, ONION, or colored PEPPERS if I have them on hand. Adding some purple cabbage really enhances the visual appeal of the dish. If I have them, I also prefer using spaetzle noodles or fresh frozen egg noodles (chewier consistency). Lastly, a sprinkle of freshly grated PARMESAN on top adds a nice little extra and a bit of protein.  Oh, and I never use even half a stick of butter for this amount of cabbage and noodles and I don't miss it. Keeps the fat to a minimum.",
