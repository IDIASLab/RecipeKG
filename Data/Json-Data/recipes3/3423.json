Here's how to make this recipe good: -Substitute cream cheese for whipped topping. -Melt cream cheese together with 1/2 c. sharp white cheddar and 1/2 c. mild yellow cheese. Add this melted mixture to the other ingredients after they are mixed. -Stick to the cream of mushroom. -Add a diced onion that has been cooked a little (I boiled it with my chicken strips to make both really tender). -Lots of salt pepper and milk. -It could stand to bake for less time. -I added parmesean and breadcrumbs to the top before baking. I hope these suggestions help!",

Someone asked what that flavor was and I told them the whipped topping and they were quite surprised that I put whipped topping in a chicken casserole. I would use cream of chicken instead of mushroom unless you're really crazy about the cream of mushroom flavor. Also a package of frozen peas with carrot would really brighten this up. Also I cubed my chicken for easy bites. Good recipe ideal but just needed some fine tuning.",

I did not make it as written I used cream cheese instead of cool whip. I am sorry but cool whip just doesn't belong in a chicken dish... That is what unsweetened whipped cream is for. I thought the spinach was a nice addition. I will make it again but with several changes. I definitely would not just glom it all together in the pot! It may be easy but the globs of velveeta were kinda gross. You are supposed to make the cheese sauce seperately then add to the casserole. This recipe needs work in order to make it into my normal cooking rotation...",
