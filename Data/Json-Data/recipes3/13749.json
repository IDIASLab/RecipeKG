Since the recipe calls for a 3 lbs bird it will be very young about 6 1/2 weeks old. There is a good chance you will see red or pink bones when finished. Don't be concerned. At that age the chickens bones are immature and very porous so they won't darken like a mature bird. As long as you remove the bird at 163-165 degrees internal it will be safe juicy and tender. With the improved science of roasting/grilling you can forget the old saying 'till the juices run clear'. Under-cooked birds can also have clear juices. Trust your temp device. Your meat is done when it is done and the color of the juice has no baring.",
