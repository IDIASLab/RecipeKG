I increased the goat cheese a little and added some red bell pepper and onion with the apples just because I needed to use them up. I also added a little crumbled bacon which I keep in the freezer for all such purposes. I'm sure it would be fine without those additions but with stuff on hand that seemed to fit why not? Thanks Chef John for a great inspiration.",
