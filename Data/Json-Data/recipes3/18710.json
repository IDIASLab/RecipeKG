I add onion, garlic, turmeric,  cumin, garam masala, use olive oil, cook in a cast iron skillet with the tomato mixture off to the side and have one egg per pita. I then cook the eggs on the other side of the skillet to throughly cook the eggs.  I hate goopy eggs. I then transfer the egg to the pita and then scoop the tomato mixture around the egg on the pita. Salt and pepper the egg to taste. Delicious! And I'm not much of an egg eater! If I can eat eggs like this, you can too. ;-)",
