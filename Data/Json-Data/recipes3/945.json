Next time I'll put a layer of chocolate-fudge topping on the bottom and maybe layer vanilla chocolate and strawberry ice cream as all strawberry was too much strawberry. I also think I'll not put the whipping cream on until serving time so it isn't frozen. It was a nice cool dessert for a hot summer day it just needed some \"tweaking\" to suit our tastes.",
