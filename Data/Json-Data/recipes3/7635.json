I also added 2 TBS of orange marmalade and the zest from the lime and the orange. No salt and no pepper. This is great as a salad a snack and also tasty over fish or chicken or pork. I think the word \"slaw\" probably turns cooks away from trying this. I'm sure glad I did try it. Thanks for sharing. Also the nice thing about the jicama is that it doesn't turn brown just stays nice and white!",
