I followed everything, including a two hour simmering with the sauce, but did throw in some slice mushrooms that had to be used or they were heading to the compost. They were a very nice addition. My shrimp was fresh so I just tossed it in the sauce the last few minutes until it pinked up. I'm keeping this one on a rotation for our household. Thanks Foodie.",
