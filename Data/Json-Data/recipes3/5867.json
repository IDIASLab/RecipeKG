Next year I will try with hotter peppers for other members of the family who thought this was too mild (I don't eat hot stuff too much so I thought it was quite spicy ;)This recipe was indeed easy,I am very much a novice at cooking anything and am learning a lot by mistakes very quickly ;) I think this recipe should come with a warning for people like me who don't know anything about cooking: When you boil those peppers open the windows turn the fan on and stand away from the stove (I choked everyone out of the kitchen with the capsacin-loaded steam that came from the pot), Also--I do know you should wear gloves when working with hot peppers but I threw caution to the wind in that respect--I thought I had washed it all off (washed many many times) but I ended up burning my eyes when I got up in the morning! and my fingertips started burning again each timeI washed my hands. Rub aloe vera on fingers thoroughly then wash off the goopy stuff, repeat if necessary (it took two times for me but then the burning was completely gone)",

I used only one small jalapeno pepper for the entire recipe and added one clove of garlic along with 2 tbsp each of canola and reserved water but the sauce was too HOT! I continued to add 2 tbsp each of canola oil and boiled water to the blender until I reached a level that was comfortable for my family (about 8 tbsp each). Finally I seasoned the sauce with a pinch of salt. The flavor was absolutely delicious!! I've made this several times and used it as a sauce for chile rellenos quesadillas tortilla chips chicken enchiladas...the list goes on. My family loves it!!",

I also added a tablespoon of sour cream to the mixture for a little sour kick. Mixture became even creamier. Had a whole lot of fun making this. Delicious:) CAUTION: When you de-seed the jalapenos please use a glove or something. I ran out of gloves and used my bare hands - BIG MISTAKE as it was red and burning for the entire day!",
