Great way to put something fresh and nutritious on the supper table while at the same time make use of the fresh vegetables in your refrigerator. As for the cheese, the Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano I had on hand would have worked just as well, but I stuck to the recipe and sent Hubs out for the feta.  I did change the dressing to the 3:1 ratio of olive oil to vinegar I prefer and used red wine vinegar rather than balsamic (not a fan of it). Light and fresh, delicious and pretty.  By all means, include the fresh basil if possible - it really makes a difference.",
