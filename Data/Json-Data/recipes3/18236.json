It was still bland so I added paprika, more garlic and some seasoned salt. I had all the bits to be a great dish, but I tasted mostly cream when I sampled it, so I just went with my gut and added more seasoning.  Once we sat to eat, everyone added even more salt. I think I will make this healthier next time, skip the cream and make an Italian dressing type sauce.  I'm giving it 3 stars as it was a good thought, but needed a lot of improvising.",
