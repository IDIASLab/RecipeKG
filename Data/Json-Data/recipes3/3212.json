I have found that it tastes better with the cheapie sausages that don't have skin...it's already very economical and those sausages go on sale for around a buck excellent meal for when I am feeling cheap!",

This resulted in it being too deep and taking too long to cook! It puffs WAY UP in the air while it cooks and deflates considerably as it cools (which is rather neat to see). As far as flavor goes I added 1/4 c. dehydrated onions and in the future I will add more spices or flavorings to the bread part. Someone mentioned cheese and I think that would be good; also garlic and of course onions galore:-) My husband called this \"Sausage Pie\" and was thrilled with it! P.S. To make this recipe work in a pie plate I believe you need to halve the entire recipe or use 2 pie plates. Thanks for the recipe it was unique enough even with needing some flavor add-ins to be a keeper!",
