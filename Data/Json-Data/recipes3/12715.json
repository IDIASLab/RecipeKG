There's a few things I would do different in making them again: only 1/2 cup honey ground flax meal in place of chickpea flour and applesauce or mashed banana in place of apple butter. The muffins made as written are a touch too sweet so I think those changes would make them just about perfect. Oh and I accidentally misread the directions and added in the coconut oil to the batter (and used muffin cups instead of oiling the muffin tin) and I would definitely do that again! I think that little bit of fat in the batter added a lot of flavor. Mine also needed to bake for at least 25-30 minutes at 350. And lastly don't be afraid to fill up the muffin cups! These don't rise very much so fill them pretty full. This recipe made 18 standard size muffins for me.",

                "reviewBody": "I hope that Monica doesn't mind the changes I made to her recipe but was looking for a fruit & veggie muffin that I could eat for breakfast. As I wanted to bake only 6 in my toaster oven I cut the recipe in half also so I made the following changes: Instead of chickpea flour which I didn't have I substituted grnd. flax meal like Kim suggested. No nutmeg so I used allspice. No apple butter so I used 1 reg. very ripe mashed banana. I had extra sweet potatoes so grated that up instead of carrots. Instead of honey I used 1/8 c. maple agave syrup plus 1 t. liq. stevia. Decided to leave out the nuts but added 1 T. of coconut oil like Kim suggested to help the vit A absorb better. I did grease my Casaware muffin pan with the oil and even though the muffin pan was filled to well over the rim the muffins came out beautifully. I love how moist and delicious that these muffins turned out and will make them again. It does seem like this recipe is easily customized to what ever you have on hand so long as you keep the basic proportions on the fruit & veggies the same.",
