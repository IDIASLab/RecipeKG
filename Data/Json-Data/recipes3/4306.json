Served it along with grilled peppers and onion, a salad of chunked cucumber, tomatoes and minced red onion and MORE cilantro tossed in PaulNewman's new Light Lime Viniagrette, and finally AllRecipe's \"Sweet Corn Cake\" recipe.

I also substituted the fresh jalepenos for the jar jalepenos and used about 3/4 cup because that is what I had on hand at the time. Beware the cilantro 2 bunches is a little vague for me. Somehow I interpreted this as two whole bunches from the grocery store. However in my area we are blessed with some pretty large bunches. I used about a 1/4 of one of my bunches and it was very thick and very very green. I was concerned that perhaps I had ruined the recipe but after scraping off the marinade and grilling my family really loved it. My suggestion is to add the cilantro to the food processor slowly until you get the consistency you like. Good recipe though easy and well worth the effort.",

The amount of food this made would feed every inmate in a Juarez prison. I ended up having to make a second trip to the grocers to buy more meat once I had discovered the monstrous amount of marinade I had staring at me from my pan. Secondly toasting the cumin seeds and pureeing the cilantro gave my house a bizarre odor which I found off-putting. For the amount of work this took to prepare I don't think it's deserving of all the fanfare. The meat ended up being edible which is at least something. I say \"adios\" to this dish.",
