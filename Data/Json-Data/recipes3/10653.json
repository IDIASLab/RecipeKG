Also I cooked the popcorn in coconut oil which works well with all of the flavors. Yum and healthy! I loved the kick from the siracha; never would have thought to use it but it works great! This will be better with fresh lime and zest the next time! Thanks ellie great recipe! UPDATE: I made this again with REAL lime juice and zest and it was a whole lot better (no surprise). The lime zest is noticeable and so good I'd even add a bit more! FYI: Best eaten when you make it. Mine was very soggy and not good on the next day.",
