I made this refreshingly cool, colorful dish a day ahead for a Labor Day get together of some major 'foodies' - got rave reviews and was named \"MVC\" - Most Valuabe Cook - of the day! I had tiny pearl to grape size red and yellow tomatoes so I just crushed them slightly when I added them to the marinade ingredients. The dainty tomatoes really enhanced the presentation! Our small town did not have fresh oregano to offer, so I took a chance with dried oregano - the taste was still great.  Also had to use regular olives this time - but this dish is a classic - it can be tweaked many ways with successful results.  Will make again soon with the fresh herbs - and then again and again and . . .",

I made some substitutions though: instead of fresh seeded tomatoes I used oil-packed sundried tomatoes as the flavor is more intense and I omitted the olives (only because I was also serving a pasta salad with fresh tomatoes and kalamata olives and didn't want the salads too similar). And the cooking time for the beans is way too long: 3-4 minutes is sufficient. Be sure the pepper is freshly ground and fairly coarse too. I love balsamic vinegar and wanted to use it rather than the red wine vinegar but I think the lighter flavor of the red wine vinegar was a good choice. All in all a refreshingly different salad.",
