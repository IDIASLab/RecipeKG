Cheez Whiz is very expensive so I felt I must speak up for those who plan on making this in the future. Everything appeared to be normal until I pulled it out of the oven after 30 minutes and tried to spoon it out. There is not enough liquid to cook the rice. The rice sunk to the bottom and was still hard as a rock. I have read the recipe over and over thinking that I surely missed a step but I did not. The only thing I can think of is that maybe you are supposed to use Minute Rice which cooks faster and doesn't require near the liquid. If you are planning on using long grain rice I highly recommend that you precook it before it goes into the oven with the other ingredients.",

Thank you to the ladies who gave the feedback re: the rice taking longer to cook than expected/hoped. Because of those reviews I amended the rice portion of the recipe. First I used Uncle Ben's Boil-n-a-Bag rice (2 packages) and MOSTLY cooked it prior to mixing it with the other ingredients. That was THE ONLY CHANGE I made to the recipe and it worked out beautifully in the time posted in the recipe. My husband was the most pleased with the results and that is all that matters to me. Again thanks for posting the recipe and thanks to those who reviewed before me!",
