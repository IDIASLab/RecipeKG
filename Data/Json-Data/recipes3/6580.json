While I would consider giving the taste/flavor 4 stars everything else was lacking. It look a lot longer to make than I expected and the recipe doesn't specify how long \"until edamame and onions are soft\" might be. I guessed and simmered it for at least 20-30 minutes. When I put the puree in the blender it seemed smooth but it was not a smooth consistency when we ate it. The milk also seemed to be WAY too much. Hard to tell since the measurement for the edamame quantity is based on shelled edamame but you start the recipe by using it still in the shell. So....bottom line.....simply boil the edamame and eat them straight with a little soy sauce. It's much better and takes a fraction of the time.",

I made some changes based on what was in the kitchen - I put a 1 lb. bag of frozen makimame (already shelled edamame) in the microwave to cook per the instructions on the bag.  I chopped up some leftover onion, a clove of garlic, and a handful of celery in a mini chopper, then sauteed the mix. I added 4 c of culinary chicken stock (the rest of the package would be wasted if I didn't).  Boil, simmer, add hot edamame beans. Cook a bit then blend with the immersion blender.  Added about 4 T butter and maybe 3 c heavy cream, then about 1/2 c of chopped bacon and seasoned with Slap Ya Mama cajun seasoning.  Plan to garnish with grated cheese, chopped green onions and more bacon.",

I made two changes: to use a 16 oz. bag which makes 7 cups; and the use of vegetable bouillon instead of chicken stock. It was easy to make. (and with a Cuisinart food processor--so very easy to get the smooth consistency I wanted!!) To make it vegetarian I used Knorr's Vegetarian Bouillon (two cubes making 4 cups of bouillon...which really imparts a lot of taste without overpowering the dish to anything you use it in) A nice change from the usual soups and my husband loved it! Perfect with dark crusty bread on a winter day or light enough for your taste buds any time of the year.",
