I also added a cup of sour cream to give it some \"tang\". I sauteed fresh mushrooms and didn't use celery. (I also only about half the cheese). Then I mixed in the cut up chicken ( a rotisserie chicken breast) and added about 2 cups of frozen broccoli (I'm not much for canned vegetables). After putting it in the pan, I microwaved some butter and the breadcrumbs (I used seasoned ones)and put it on top. I baked it covered with foil. It was very good. My husband really liked it.

I made a few changes, though: I used 3 cups uncooked egg noodles, no onion (hate it), 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, fresh carrots, mushrooms and celery.  Saute the carrots and celery in the butter until crisp tender.  Add the mushrooms during the last 3 minutes or so.  Lightly sprinkle this saute with seasoning salt and onion powder.  Everything else was the same as the original recipe, except I mixed 3/4 cups garlic herb bread crumbs with 1 Tbsp melted butter before sprinkling it on top.  Great recipe!",

I used frozen peas and corn rather than the carrots, celery, and onions and was able to skip the sauteeing step. I added celery salt in place of the celery and onion powder in place of the onion. I didn't have any leftover chicken so I just threw some frozen chicken breasts in the microwave for 10 minutes and then shredded it. These changes made it a lot quicker to prepare, and very kid-friendly. My 4 and 1 year olds declared it \"yum!\". Oh, and my husband and I enjoyed it too :) Great recipe!",

People went absolutely crazy over it! Since I did not have kitchen facilities backstage,I baked it ahead, rewarmed it in a  microwave, and kept it warm in a steamtable pan. I guess people who live out on the road alot don't get too much home cooked food.  But, then I brought the leftovers to my parents and they raved about it as well.  It also freezes great.",
