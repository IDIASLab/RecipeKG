He's absolutely addicted to them.\n\nHe tried these tonight and said that he thought they were even better than the ones at the restaurant.  I did make some slight modifications based on earlier raters' suggestions and on his particular tastes.  I doubled the cheese and used the extra aged super sharp cheddar.  I mixed the garlic in with the Bisquik & cheese, and then I put parsley and more garlic in the butter and brushed it on both before and after baking.  The biscuits turned out *extremely* light, they almost felt like they were going to float right out of my mouth.",
