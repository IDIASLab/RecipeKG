I used the same amount of broccoli cauliflower red onion garlic pepperoni cheese (although I used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella) and olives. I also added a small package of grape tomatoes and some Parmesan cheese. For the dressing I used two.7 ounce packages of Good Seasons packets and followed the directions on the package but using olive oil. The finished product was delicious but almost a little too wet when it was all finished. To my surprise though when I got up in the morning the salad had absorbed a lot of the dressing and it was a little too dry so I had to add some bottled Italian dressing I had. Very good and easy to make especially for a large crowd or a dish for a potluck. I'm sure my recipe served probably 25-30 people as side dishes.",

It had a pretty look with all of the colors but the taste was not good. Too much twang from the oil/vinegar mixture too much of a bite from the raw red onions and just no flavor. I picked-out the noodles to eat them alone or with the mozzarella. I took it to a picnic tonight... no one said 'yum'. And it took waaay longer than 15 minutes to make what with all of that chopping so it was really disappointing to spend all of that time right before the event and then to have it be not-so-good.
