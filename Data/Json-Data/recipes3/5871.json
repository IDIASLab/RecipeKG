Sometimes we'll throw in some julienne green beans. I also think they are better with lumpia wrappers but if all you can find are egg roll wrappers they are a decent substitute. The great thing about lumpia is you can make the filling to your taste. Ask anyone one from the Philippines and they'll tell you that every family has their own version of lumpia adobo pancit or any dish for that matter.",
