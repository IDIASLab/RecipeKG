We re about mid-range on spiciness and in the future I ll add more jalapeno. The recipe didn t say whether or not to peel the potatoes but next time I ll probably just leave the skins on. Think that ll add more color to the dish. Love mashed potatoes and this is a good recipe!",

I guess it depends if you are using fresh jalape\u00f1o or slices and if they are hot or mild. I used fresh. 1.5 was too hot even for my spice lovers. I would say stick with the recipe as written or add a little at a time and add to taste.",
