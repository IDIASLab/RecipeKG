I couldn\u2019t find any cilantro at the store so I didn\u2019t put that in although definitely will next time.  I used a whole 14oz can of coconut milk instead of the 1 c. It calls for.  I used avocado oil instead of olive oil simply because I like it better. I also only used 1 lb of shrimp because I forgot to pick up more. Oh, and I forgot to add in the lime juice, ugh. The can of diced tomatoes with the chilies comes in a 10oz can here I didn\u2019t realize til later but the 10oz can was just fine.  The next time I make this I will double the recipe as we like to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Excellent recipe!! Make it!!",
