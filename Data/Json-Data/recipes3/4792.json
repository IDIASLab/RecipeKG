I left them open faced and just closed the grill for a few minutes to melt the cheese. To serve I topped each with freshly ground black pepper and a parsley sprig. It was so simple and tasted fantastic. Next time I think I would brush the tomato slice with the olive oil/balsamic mixture, just because they kind of dried out on the grill.

Slice the eggplant as normal, lay on paper towels, and sprinkle with salt. Let it sit for about 30 min, then rinse and pat dry. Then you can marinate as normal. \n\nAlso, did not make sandwiches with it- that's too hard to grill! Grilled one side of the eggplant, flipped, and put on cheese and tomato. Never made the eggplant \"sandwich.\" \n\nNext I'm going to try slicing the eggplant lengthwise, grilling as normal, and rolling and securing with a toothpick after they're off the grill to make eggplant rolls!",

The only changes I made was to salt the slices and let them sit on paper towels about 30 minutes then pat dry.  Then I marinated them in the olive oil & balsamic vinegar until I was ready to put the slices on the grill.  I grilled one side 7-8 minutes then flipped over and added the goat cheese and tomato slices and grilled another 7-8 minutes. Also, I served them open-faced instead of sandwich style.  Thanks so much for a really great recipe! ",

I was worried the balsamic vinegar would overwhelm the eggplant but it was awesome. Just the right flavor. I made this on the stove and modified the recipe as follows: 1 medium eggplant sliced 3/4\"-1\" thick; 3 T. balsamic vinegar; 3 T. olive oil; generous dashes of salt pepper and garlic salt; 1 c. mozzerella cheese; 1/4 small onion diced; 1 c. medium cocktail shrimp tails off cut in half; and dash of Italian seasoning. Add eggplant vinegar oil salt pepper and garlic salt to gallon-sized plastic bag. Mix around and let sit for 30 minutes to marinate. Heat large pan on medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray and arrange all slices on pan. Cook approximately three minutes (until the balsamic carmelizes on the eggplant) then flip the eggplant and cook the other side for three more minutes. Heat a separate small skillet on medium heat. Spray with cooking spray and saute onions. When the onion is nearly done add shrimp and cook until opaque. Add Italian seasoning. Layer as follows on half of the eggplant slices (leaving the other half plain as those will be the top of the \"sandwiches\"): 2 T. mozzerella cheese 2-3 T. shrimp mixture and 2 T. mozzerella cheese. Put the plain eggplant slices on top to create 4-5 sandwiches. Continue cooking until cheese is melted.",
