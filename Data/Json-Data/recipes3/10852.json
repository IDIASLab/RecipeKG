I first baked the cauliflower florets (an entire head because it shrinks) with diced onion diced tomato and chopped uncooked bacon with a light spray of EVOO and a dash of seasoning salt. I put it on a baking tray and let it roast at 425 for about 15 minutes until dark golden brown and crispy. I then took a round baking dish and first put a spoon full of sauce then the cauliflower mix Portuguese sausage parmesan cheese fresh chopped basil then Prego Roasted Garlic sauce (it was what I had in my pantry but chicken and white sauce would be good too!) and repeated until all the fixins were in the dish. I then took some home made bread crumbs and left over cheese to cover the top and baked again at 425 for about 15 minutes until the cheese was browned. It turned out great and hubby loved it (he's my guinea pig for new recipes). It went well with Hahn wine too! It was a great \"baked pasta\" dish but fewer carbs. Cauliflower can be used in lieu of or in conjunction with breads pizza crust pasta mac n' cheese or any carb- heavy dish. Hope you will try and enjoy!",
