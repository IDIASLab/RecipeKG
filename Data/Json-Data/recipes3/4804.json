I used one can(14.5 oz.) petite diced tomatoes (undrained) in place of the fresh tomato. I figured this would help with the dryness other reviewers mentioned. I doubled the garlic basil and oregano. I use much less pasta otherwise it will be dry. I skipped mixing together the parmesan and crackers (who needs more dishes to wash) opting instead to just sprinkle them both on separate at the end (I only used about 6 buttery crackers). I would highly recommend this recipe as a way to help use up your abundance of zucchini. Give it a try!",
