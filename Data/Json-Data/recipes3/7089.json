With this recipe I added 1/2 C sliced Red Delicious Apple - peeled during the onion sautee step and adjusted some measurements: 1/2 C red onion 3 T red onion and 1 orange - 1 red - 1 yellow green pepper. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE We happened to be having grilled brats with German pickle spears and Horseradish Mustard for dinner. This dish complemented it very nicely though next time I will use crunchy deli chips or toasted Lavash. I grilled tortillas and found them too flimsy and doughy. And finally the Flafla was wonderful ON THE BRATS!! I wonderful year-round alternative for folks that do not care for sauer kraut. P.S. This dish is LOADED with Vitamins C and D!",
