I don\u2019t care for the packaged bacon bits, so I just fried some stripe of bacon and then crumbled them.  The one thing I didn\u2019t know was whether or not the egg would rise in the mold, but I went ahead and cooked them with the plastic lid on.  And they not rise much..  They were perfectly cooked, tender, tasty, and plated rather interestingly.  My husband asked \u201c\u2026what are these?\u201d  But he liked them as much as I did.  Don\u2019t know how these compare to Starbucks\u00ae, but in this house, they\u2019re 5 stars!",
