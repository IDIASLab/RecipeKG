I didn't think they were dry cake or soft like a muffin. The centers were more like cooked dense bananas. The add ins saved these. I used 1/2 chocolate chunks and 1/2 milk chocolate chips as it was what I had. I cut the raisins to 2 1 oz boxes and it was plenty. Additionally I subbed flax meal for the seed. I didn't have the seed and didn't want to bite into them anyway. I added a splash of vanilla also to the bananas. I made 1/2 recipe and got 12 good sized muffins. I like that this was egg free made with whole grains and didn't have any refined sugar. However chocolate chips do have sugar. So it is a little mis-leading. I ate about 3 of them and 1 more was eaten. The rest got tossed after they sat and no one ate them unfortunately.",
