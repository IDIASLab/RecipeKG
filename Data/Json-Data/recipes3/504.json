It is soft, yet still looks glossy and shiny even after it sets.  I used this to glaze the rather plain tasting \"Neapolitan Cake,\" also from this site, and they were perfect for each other. This would be the type of glaze I'd expect to see on European tortes or petit fours -it has that kind of smooth, professional look. I used the microwave to make this but let it go a little too long, so it wasn't as perfectly smooth as it should have been -be extra careful and attentive when melting chocolate, especially when you're using the expensive, good stuff! Once melted, it was a little too thin to pour, so I just stuck it in the fridge, stirring every now and then, till it became the right consistency. Serious chocolate fans will love this glaze!  ",
