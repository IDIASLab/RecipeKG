This is great any night of the week but we do love it in the fall and winter on football days! In the summer we also use all of our ingredients from our local farmers market...even our organic beef.

I used a green bell pepper instead of red and also added some red-pepper flakes because I didn't have a green chile pepper and used butter in the bottom of my skillet--not olive oil. I didn't have yogurt so I sprinkled mild cheddar cheese and I used regular ground beef 80% lean. This is very far from the original recipe but the concept was what I was after. The final product even after so much switching around wasn't bad. It is very filling. It took an hour to cook my large sweet potatoes and in the end my dad my mom and I split one potato into quarters and I couldn't even finish my share. (We're not big eaters to start with). On the whole my version wasn't bad but my version isn't something I'd really go out of my way to have again. Maybe when I have the right ingredients I'll try it again. This was just an alternative to the hamburger helper my dad intending on making and I'm getting to really hate hamburger helper!",
