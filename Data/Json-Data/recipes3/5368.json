I also added a layer of grated cheddar cheese between and on top of the layers of potatoes. To keep with the southwest flavors I seemed to be building I added a can of diced green chiles to the cream of chicken soup. This was a great budget meal and we liked it quite a bit.

I love the basic idea of the recipe though.  Next time I will probably add soem parmesan cheese in the middle and instead of saltine crackers, I will use ritz.
