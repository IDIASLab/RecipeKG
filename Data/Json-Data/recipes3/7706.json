He had never eaten duck of course and he loved it! The whole family really enjoyed this meal! It is super simple and super Yummy! I told DS I was replacing the T Day turkey with duck and he bout cried. He loves turkey we can have both next year! I rubbed the duck with the spice mixture and roasted them till they reached 160 degrees. Moist and delish! Hubby wanted the duck straight up so I went w/o any sauce. I also made the most Fantastic roasted potatoes while the duck was cooking with the duck fat!! OMG They were the best part!! Small red potatoes salt pepper and poultry seasoning poured on the fat and cooked till they were golden brown. Thanks for a Great recipe HE Be GB.",

I had to adjust the roasting time as I had a 6 lb. duck. I will definitely roast another one! I will use this recipe ingredients for other roasting ideas such as chicken and roasts and such. Definitely a great meal! I drained the fat and used the remaining juices and spices and made a fantastic gravy that was poured over the pieces of duck in my plate! There was only one leg and the bones left which will now be \"Duck Soup!\" Thanks for a great recipe.",
