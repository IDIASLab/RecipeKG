They challenged me to make an egg salad on a stick and this is what I came up with. Use whatever ingredients your family likes. They are healthier than hen eggs. Typically 5 quail eggs equals one serving. Serve chilled or at room temperature with mustard, mayonnaise, and capers.",

This is a perfect summertime lunch that won't leave you feeling weighted down with all of the bread in your typical egg salad sandwich. Plus who doesn't love food on a stick? This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing Buckwheat Queen!",
