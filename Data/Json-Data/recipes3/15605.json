The only thing I did differently is that I didn't use the vanilla or maple syrup.  I think the blueberries, banana and coconut added enough sweetness (well, and I simply forgot as it was way too early in the morning).  Good consistency too with the soaked oats.  Easy recipe.  Made extra and keep it in the freezer.  Thaw or microwave for a few seconds to loosen it up, and it's ready to go!  Thanks - will be making again!",

I used blueberry almond milk from Trader Joes and the blueberries were frozen which helped to thicken the mixture.  Topped with the coconut, blueberries and chia seeds per recipe and it made a nice presentation.  My hubby was impressed!  He wanted to know if this was 'gourmet'!!  Could see where you could use strawberries, raspberries, etc. in place of the blueberries for a change.  Next time, to make it even healthier I plan to put a scoop of protein powder that one reviewer has already suggested.  Thanks barbara for this great recipe!",
