Even my husband who normally hates green leafy vegetables (or in fact practically any vegetables!) really liked it and asked for it to be made again the same way. The only reason I am giving it 4 and not 5 stars is because the directions are inaccurate. This recipe took me almost an hour to prepare and not 20 minutes as is stated in the directions! This considering that I only made half the suggested serving size! The chard stems alone took about 20-25 mins to soften on medium heat and the leaves took A LOT longer to wilt on \"low\" than 2 minutes (I would say about 15 mins at least?) I started cooking ahead of time thinking that I'll have this ready even before the main course (freshly caught rainbow trout and mashed potatoes) but as it turned out we were about half way done with our meal before I could serve the chard. Nonetheless the flavors work really well together and I really like the idea of saving and using the stems when so many recipes call for discarding them. They are similar in texture to celery but have a much milder taste. So bottom line - this is delicious and I highly recommend the recipe but you should plan to start cutting the leaves and cooking at least 45 minutes to an hour before you plan to serve this.",
