I used Italian breadcrumbs and mixed in a dash of garlic powder, salt, pepper and cayenne. I am very diet-conscious, so I completely eliminated the use of butter.  Instead of buttering the pan, i placed a cooling rack in the bottom of the 9x13 pan and lightly coated it with cooking spray.  Instead of adding a pad of butter on top of the chicken, I lightly misted them with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray.  Since the chicken was not saturated with butter and because it was elevated with the use of the cooling rack, the chicken was crunchy all around, rather than soggy on the bottom.  Very delicious flavor, though.  My family loved the zippiness of the lemon yogurt.",

The results were perfect: I ended with tender lemony chicken breasts, seasoned just the way I like them. I didn't wait 5 to 10 minutes before serving (kitchen smelled too good to let this chicken sit that long).",

To tenderize the chicken a bit, I actually cut it into tenders and marinated it the yogurt (Greek, non fat), garlic (fresh), lemon juice, and 1/4 tsp of celery salt and 1/2 tsp of onion powder.  After about 10 hrs in the fridge, I dipped the tenders in panko (seasoned with cayenne, paprika, salt, onion powder, garlic salt and pepper) baked them for 15 mins on one side, 10 mins on the other side (350 degrees) and then put them under the broiler for about 2-3 mins to crisp them up.  They turned out GREAT! And there was no need for the extra fat and calories of the butter (although I'm sure it taste good with it!)  Thanks, Twila",
