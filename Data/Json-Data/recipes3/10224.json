Melt in the pan, and mix with small amount of garlic and butter and onion.  I add a can of tomato sauce.  Mix together and then pour over stuffed cabbage.  It is also a good idea to mix some of the melted salt pork into the meat. By the way, I only use ground pork, no ground beef. Its more tender and flavorful.",

Mine, & the dozen other \u201cantique\u201d recipes I have, show a variation of crushed whole tomatoes, sliced or stewed tomatoes (my grandmother has a fantastic antique recipe for stewed tomatoes!!!), and tomato sauce, plus spices such as marjoram, thyme, bay, & always in tomato dishes, two walnut shell haves of white sugar.  I\u2019m trying this tonight, as shown, plus some more with a jar of crushed stewed tomatoes in with the soup, because I personally like the chunks & juice like sauce, over the top.

The combination cooked down nicely to not only be thick, but also had exactly the right amount of \"bite,\" presumably from the vinegar in the Ketchup. The only changes I made were:\n- added an egg to help bind it\n- used approx 1/2 teaspoon Garlic Powder (instead of Garlic Cloves)\n- added 1/2 teaspoon Paprika\n- and I seasoned the water right before adding the rice (a little butter, salt and pepper, of course, but also some Paprika and Parsley).\n\nI will definitely make this again.

The only difference was I added 2 TB of Worcheshire (sp) sauce because I have always put in my cabbage rolls.  We also used Jimmy Dean sausage instead of just ground pork and it gave it an extra little kick.  I'm sure it would be great without doing these two things so I gave it a 5 stars.  Great tasting.",
