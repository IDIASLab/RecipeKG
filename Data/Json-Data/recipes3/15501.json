I still do, but after all these years, it's pretty much the same ingredients every time!  Be sure to remove bay leaves before serving. This sauce keeps for at least 2 weeks in the fridge. It's a great sauce for pasta, lasagna and pizza. If sauce tastes too acid from the tomatoes, a little instant coffee will tone down the acid, however, BE VERY CAREFUL. Too much of either will kill the taste of the sauce completely!",
