They had pretty good flavor, I used a spicy italian sausage.   I rolled the balls in parmesan before I backed them which gave them a a nice thin crispy coating.  Over all this was a good recipe.  I am going to try them on keto pizza with a little diced pepperoni added in.",

I made them with regular Jimmy Dean natural sausage maybe a bit more than 1/2 c. sharp cheese because I like it so much. I splurged and bought some really great shredded Parmesan cheese. They were a little sticky when rolling them into balls. I think they needed to cook a little longer than 35 minutes but I live at altitude so I blame some of that on where I live. Super yummy!! I will make these again.",

They were extremely greasy and when I tried to roll them or blot the top to remove all the grease they would start falling apart. The parmesan cheese overpowers all other flavors and the cream cheese makes them a bit too creamy. Overall we really did not care for these.",
