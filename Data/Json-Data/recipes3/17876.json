Me boyfriend LOVED it. For 2019 me New Years resolution I made was to make a new recipe a totally new recipe every month. This was mine for January. I had to make a NEW batch immediately after me boyfriend ate the 1st batch The cracker I used was BIG Taco Chips from Ortega.. Worked like a charm. I split them in 1/2 then put this Tartare on each 1/2. The taste really worked. Thank you soo bloody much for a wonderful start to 2019. Cheers & GOD Bless.
