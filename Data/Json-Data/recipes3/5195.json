To begin with, the vibrant colors of red, purple, fleshy orange, and green makes one want to dive right in.  The only changes I made were to double the red onion to half cup, and only used 2 tbsp. of EVOO, and added 2 seeded jalepenos.  The blend of flavors was magnificant.  To bite into that creaminess of the avocado, the bite of the pepper, the sweetness of the mango, and of course garlic and cilantro was to die for.  You will want to double this if you take it to a party because I made it just for my husband and myself to go with \"Sizzling Chicken Fajitas\" from this site, and I probably ate half of it on chips before the dinner was prepared.  I did use 4 roma tomatoes as stated in the recipe and it was perfect.  Just squeeze out the tomatoes before putting in so that it won't be soupy.  This would be a great salad by itself if cut into bigger pieces instead of dicing for salsa. If one is not a big garlic lover, I would cut down on the garlic.  I am a garlicholic and so for me, it sent me to heaven!  This takes salsa to a new level...absolutely a cut above the rest.",

I've never had this kind of salsa before so didn't know what to expect. Man is this good! Slightly sweet slightly savory slightly spicy with an explosion of flavor from the garlic jalapeno and cilantro - and the creamy mellow avocado brings it all together and balances it out. After \"sampling\" a good portion of it Hubs remarked that he didn't think he was going to like this but found it \"strangely addictive.\" I backed off on the cilantro by maybe half and that worked out well for us. Other than that I followed the recipe and liked it just fine. This is so colorful and festive it just beckons you to come and try it. It tastes so good it makes you go back for more.",
