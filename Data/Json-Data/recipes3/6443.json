After 10 minutes I drained the hot water and covered with cool and then shelled them. I used a small cookie scoop to fill each egg white. For the bodies of the spiders: I halved the drained olives and then patted them dry with a paper towel. For the spider legs I just cut slices. The red eyes are made out of Betty Crocker Cookie Icing but I DO NOT RECOMMEND doing this because within 30 minutes the icing slides right off:(:( The taste of the egg is excellent. Will make again and will continue trying to figure out a way to make eyes.",
