Next time I'd probably use more broth... Serving suggestion: add some lime and if you like spice try making the aji sauce that is often served with it. MMMM...",

This made it more traditional and extra delicious. Just make sure you handle the aji with disposable gloves or plastic bags in your hands while you get the veins and seeds of them rinse and cut into medium slivers. Another note don't chop the stems of the cilantro in your mix. They are bitter however difficult try to use leaves only. Scissors helped.",
