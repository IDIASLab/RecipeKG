Maybe that's why - I'm somewhat of a salmon purist as I think it is such a flavorful fish it really doesn't need a sauce this strong. Also I think the balsamic vinegar is way too strong in this. I won't make this again with salmon but I may tweak the sauce and try it with something like pork or chicken. Too bad - I love the thought of using blueberries is something other than muffins/breads or dessert....",

I followed this recipe without variations until I could do no more. The balsamic totally overpowered the berries. After doubling the OJ and honey it still was not improved. I added a whole tbs of sugar and a bit of vanilla to no avail. I don't know what purpose the chives served in this sauce. I couldn't taste any hint of them let alone see them etc. When my husband dropped the fish on the ground by accident I think that was sign from above to spare us this dish. We would have ate the fish without the sauce and I know I would have like that. Dinner was ruined with or without this sauce. We ended up having cheeseburgers. Factoring in the cost of that; this meal cost us in the neighborhood of 30 for the two of us to eat at home. I want my money back!!!",
