Besides - I would rather eat lard or butter than hydrogenated  shortening.  I used this for chicken pot pie.  It is a keeper!  I doubled the recipe for a top and bottom crust.  Note - freeze the lard in small cubes.    I made this in the food processor, with short pulses - blended the flour and salt - added the lard - pulse - then added the egg and vinegar mixed together - pulse and then about 2 teaspoons of water.  This will be my go to recipe for the holiday baking season.  :)",

But it is definitely worth making again as the egg contributes richness and flavor and the vinegar is known to contribute flakiness.",
