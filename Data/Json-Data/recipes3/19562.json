Now I will intentionally get schedule layovers in Ohio to get my 4-way fix.  \n\nThis is the closest recipe I've ever been able to make - it was just delicious!  I did boil my hamburger in the broth as other posters suggested - but I did continue to add 2 cups of broth as it boiled down.  We boiled the meat for 2 hours and it had a pretty fine consistency at that point.\n\nWe upped the cinnamon by 50% like others suggested and also shorted the chili powder by 1/4 (we ran out).  Heavenly on spaghettini with finely shredded mild cheddar!!\n\nCan't wait to bring this to work for lunch.  YUM!",

I reccomend you use 50% more cinnamon than in the recipe and a litle more chili powder. This is not the recipe to try if you are looking for a twist on a \"traditional\" chili, it is more of what most people would consider a \"spaghetti sauce\". It is best served over a plate of thin spaghetti, topped with finely chopped white onions ans mounded finely shredded mild cheddar cheese. The chili should be VERY hot when served this way so as to melt the cheese as you eat it. Traditionally it is served with oyster crackers used to soak up the left over juice after the spaghetti is gone. Enjoy!",

I have adapted it to our tastes - no chopped onion while cooking (use onion powder for the smooth texture) and I cook the ground beef in an additional cup or two of broth then drain to remove the extra fat - I also have added more broth and just simmered until it all reduces and gets beautiful and smooth and thick. Also I add just a touch of molasses (maybe a tsp or two). Freezes beautifully if you ever have any left - we never seem to. This has been a big hit at family gatherings and we also like to serve it on hot dogs as a change from serving over spaghetti (sacrilege I know but it's GOOD! LOL).",

My family prefers it with the chili powder halved, no cayenne, and all the other spices bumped up a bit -- including 1/4 t of ground cardamom.",
