I didn't have spelt flour, so I used regular all-purpose flour instead. Overall, the cake turned out all right. At the 20mi mark it was still wet in the middle, and it was all done after 25min.  It is dry and very crumbly. I rose a little bit,  so I cut in half and used a rum syrup ( 1/4 cup of water, 1/4 cup of sugar brought to boil, then added 1tbs rum and 1tbs of vanilla) to sprinkle the 2 layers with. I also made a cream cheese buttercream ( 1 pack of cream cheese, 1 stick of butter and ~1.5 cups of sugar, 2 tbs of rum). It tastes better with the cream, otherwise it's just too dry for me. My family likes it so I may  bake it again.",
