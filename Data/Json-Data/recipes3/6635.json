I actually use 1 cup fat free plain yogurt and 1/3 cup Light Sour Cream and 1/3 cup Veganaise grapeseed oil Mayo. (sometimes a splash of buttermilk too) I'm sure it would be great as written though and the spices are just perfect! My husband likes a thick dressing and LOTS of it. He is also so picky about his Ranch (he was attached to the bottled stuff) But he absolutely LOVES this. He eats it every day at lunch on his Salads. I did NOT want to be feeding him MSG and tons of fat and preservatives everyday so this recipe is a Lifesaver!",
