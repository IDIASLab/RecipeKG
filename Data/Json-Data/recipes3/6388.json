I have a whole freezer full of chicken but ignored it all when the grocer had these babies in on special - frog is a firmer white flesh like chicken breast with a yummy seafood flavor, and I'd suggest trying this recipe whether you have \"spare frog legs for some reason\" or not!",

Time is approximate: it depends on your exact cooking temperature and the size of the frog legs. Mine were Jumbo and took about 3 minutes per each of the four sides (if you only turn them once they will take longer per side). I like them browned all over. Triple the sauce use 1/3 to marinate (throw this away after use) Use other 2/3rds to make dipping sauce by adding cornstarch a little at a time. Will ABSOLUTELY make again and again!",
