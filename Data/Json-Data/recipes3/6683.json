My yearly gorge of all the morels my son-in-law can provide is also fried in butter. Also, morels are delicious when sauteed with rib eyes and/or chicken breasts with a touch of garlic. DELICIOUS!",

They are not like button mushrooms that soak up water brushing won't work with these. I used the spray nozzle on faucet to really get them and sand out. Drained well. Next like all the others you must use butter with morels. I know it killed me to use 3-4 sticks to fry these - my heart was cringing! Thank the Lord they only grow in the spring and we enjoy them only once. I use saltines for fish frying but I had Bisquick (which I don't normally use) so I thought I'd try that. I found after trying both methods (first dipping in milk/egg and then mix and then combining all together like a batter) I liked how they turned out with the batter instead. Then the mix doesn't clump on the morels and is more evenly coated. Add the seasoning along with a little garlic salt to the baking mix.",

I fried a few in oil and after trying them fried the rest in butter. I won't try frying them in oil again. Butter Morels = Heaven. I also made some morels the usual way I prepare them for my fiance (egg and flour) but he admitted that this breading was pretty tasty. So 4 stars because the breading was tasty. Bottom line: replace the oil with butter! Thanks:)",
