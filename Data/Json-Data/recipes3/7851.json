I use Brie when making it in the U.S. Reblochon cheese is the authentic cheese for the dish, but it's impossible to find in the USA. Raclette cheese mixed with Gruyere is also a good substitute.",

I have always used Reblochon cheese - it is regularly available here in Monterey County California at the better cheese shops. Yes Brie works - but it often has an ammonia smell/taste which is never the case with Reblochon. This is a great side dish easy to make and pleasing to almost everybody.",

I had this a few times when I was in France and it is fabulous treat after a day on the slopes or while sipping on a Sancerre on a cold winter's night in Paris. I had to go to 3 cheese stores to find the Reblochon because brie just isn't the same. Having said that probably isn't necessary. The one thing I would change to this recipe is blending a glass of white wine (a Sancere or Sauvignon Blanc) with the creme fraiche. Also I don't think it needs to be cooked for so long at that temperature. If you want it to bake quicker put it in a 450F oven for 17-20 minuts uncovered.",
