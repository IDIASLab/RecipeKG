LOL I used poultry seasonings instead of individual spices (again thats what I had on hand) which worked LOVELY! I didn't measure I just dumped some in! I also used some of the turkey drippings instead of chicken broth and I omitted the butter (out of sheer forgetfulness) I will experiment with adding an egg and more broth next time because it was a bit dry for my taste.
