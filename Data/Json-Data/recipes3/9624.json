They think it is the best I have ever made and since it is WAY easier than a traditional fudge recipe this one will be it from here on out! My microwave has high wattage so I cooked the ingredients in one-minute increments and it was completely melted after three minutes. Also did you know that they sell crushed peppermints in specialty stores? That made the recipe even more simple to make! I think next time I will increase the peppermint extract to 2 teaspoons as others have recommended.",
