You take 1/4 c soy sauce, 2 tbsp packed brown sugar, 1/8 tsp ground ginger and 1 clove crushed garlic - mix it all together and marinate the water chestnuts (we also use chicken livers)covered, in the refridgerator for 2 hours.  Then drain the marinade and wrap the bacon around the water chestnut and chicken liver - secure with toothpick, and bake 25-30 minutes, until the bacon is crisp.  My mom used to make it all the time - they are great!  I have also had it with the \"BBQ\" sauce of ketchup and brown sugar - its good as well, but you really have to start out with this base marinade.",
