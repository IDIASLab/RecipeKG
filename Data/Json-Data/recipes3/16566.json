It's that good and very easy.\nI didn't read the directions, but having cooked for a number of years, I figured out the method. OK, it wasn't as written but I had fabulous results. So I melted the butter in a saucepan, then gently cooked the garlic.  Then I made this into a white sauce of sorts w/ the flour and milk.  I squeezed my spinach dry as I don't care for that liquid in the spinach (tastes like the freezer), so I added more milk.  It got a little dry while waiting to serve it, so I threw in some fatfree half and half (what a wonderful invention!!!).\nAdd the nutmeg - freshly ground if you have it.  It adds just the right touch to a creamed dish.  I used white pepper and sea salt and plenty of fresh parm..   YUMMMMMMM!!!",

I will make this again but will make more sauce and try additions to ramp-up the flavor - more garlic sauted onions maybe bacon... guess it'll have to be a work in progress!",

I had never made creamed spinach from scratch at home, so I was looking for a simple recipe.  This was exactly what I was looking for!  The only thing I did differently was to skip the microwave step, sauteeing the garlic in the butter before making the roux in my dutch oven, and I used a pound of fresh baby spinach instead of frozen (next time I'll use a pound and a half).  Even my daughter, who doesn't like cooked spinach, ate hers without complaint!  Thanks for a great recipe that will absolutely be a regular in my kitchen :-)",
