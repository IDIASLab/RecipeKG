If I have green pepper on hand, I'll usually chop that up and throw it in there too. I've also done this with frozen cheese tortellini and tri-colored tortellini with great results. This is a simple, great tasting salad and just a little different from regular pasta salad...Always a hit! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Took some reviewers advice and used a variety of olives, marinated artichokes, and marinated mozzarella balls from the \"Mediterranean Bar\" (next to the salad bar) at the grocery store.  Added slivered red & green peppers, halved cherry tomatoes, and hard salami.  Used tri-colored cheese tortellini - and after cooking, tossed it in a little bit of the marinade from the container of olives, artichokes, and mozzarella so it wouldn't stick together before I added in all the other ingredients.  When finished, to help with marinating - I put the whole salad in a gallon size ziploc bag and laid it flat in the fridge.  Every so often, I flipped it over to mix it up a little bit.  Great space saver, too!  Needed to make several salads at the same time and marinated them this way, stacked on top of each other!",

The only thing I did different was added extra green onions and instead of marinated artichoke hearts I used the plain artichoke hearts and let them marinate in Italian dressing for about a half hour before adding them in. I also skipped the olive oil balsamic vinegar and white vinegar and just used more of the Italian dressing (Wishbone) with some added Italian herb seasoning added to it. Made it simpler and I believe just as yummy! makign it again for another party this month!",

I loved the ingredients in it-- pretty much all things I like. But somehow the final product was kind of bland. It must have been the dressing. I think I will make this again because I really like the parts but I will use kalamata olives for more flavor maybe throw in some parmesan for depth and I might use a bottled Greek or Italian dressing rather than just the oil/vinegar/Italian herbs. I think this salad has potential but it needs some tweaking to be up to my standards.",
