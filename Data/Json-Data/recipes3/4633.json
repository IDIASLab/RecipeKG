Cut the black pepper to 1 tsp, used olive oil & butter (around 2 Tbs. total), added garlic & mustard.  The mustard is a brilliant suggestion!  It really makes the dish.  I serve this with buttered egg noodles (actually, I used a \"Smart\" butter-like spread instead of real butter).  Add the buttered egg noodles to the cabbage & kielbasa mixture at the end and stir it all together.  You need a really BIG pot, as this makes a huge amount!  Tasty, easy recipe; I'll be making this quite often!",

Well, we polished off the entire dish between us very easily. Don't worry about having too much cabage in the beginning. It cooks down a lot. Also, don't be discouraged if it doesn't taste great at first. Once it cooks for the entire 20 minutes, the juices from the Kielbasa and all the other flavors mix really well. I served it with instant brown rice and it was perfect. No way there's enough for 4, though. We're not big eaters and the two of us finished it with no problems.",
