        "description": "A few years back, Lima, Peru was named the culinary capital of the western hemisphere. With such deceptively simple yet delirious delicious food, one can see why. This is my take on a traditional lamb stew called 'seco cordero.' Pisco is a Peruvian spirit made from grapes similar to but not exactly like grappa. You can substitute grappa or leave it out entirely. Goes well with white rice; excellent day-of or reheated the next. This could also be made in a slow cooker.",

My lamb pieces were small so I was unable to cook it long enough to let the sauce thicken but the flavor was excellent and turned out super tender! I wanted some extra texture to serve on top of my lamb pieces so I made the parsley vinegar sauce from Chef John's Roasted Lamb Breast recipe from this site. Like other reviewers I was able to find the pepper in paste form and it was delicious! Expensive but delicious. Lamb cuts are not easy to find in my area and it is expensive when I do find it. That is a shame because I could make this recipe every single week. It was really that good. Very impressive! Thanks for sharing!",

Also added a jar of Aji Amarillo paste and cilantro paste as another reviewer suggested. Made a day in advance then reheated. Lamb was falling off the bones rich and wonderful! Served the shanks on a platter and poured the sauce and peas from the pans into a bowl with ladel. Garnished with fresh cilantro springs and served with Brazilian-style rice. Excellent! Would definitely do again!",
