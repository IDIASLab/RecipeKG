I suggest that you use a homemade ranch dressing mix, sans salt, as the soup is salty enough on it's own. I mix ranch dressing mix with plain AP flour, coat the pork chops in the flour/ranch mixture and then fry them on both sides. I then saute an onion and chopped mushrooms in butter and then add the soup and milk to make the sauce. EDITED: I made this again tonight, adding a little worchestershire sauce and a touch of sour cream. I layered the pork chops in a baking dish and covered it with sauce and baked it for an hour until it was all fall-aparty. I served it with fluffy rice and steamed broccoli. Again, everyone loved it. HUGE success. NO leftovers.",
