I did not use butter or oil--only the oil on the sun-dried tomatoes.  In addition to cauliflower, I used broccoli and carrots. Instead of roasting the vegetables, I cooked them in the microwave for 5 minutes. I used canned mushrooms and dried basil since neither were on hand. A great quick and tasty lunch meal. Thanks!!",
