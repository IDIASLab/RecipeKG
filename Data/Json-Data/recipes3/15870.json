When the water has reached a boil, cover and remove from heat. Let sit 12 minutes. Transfer eggs to a colander; place under cool running water to stop the cooking. Eggs can be peeled immediately.\n\nFollow this recipe once and then use it as a launching board to make up your own deviled egg combinations.",
