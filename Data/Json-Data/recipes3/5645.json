Instead of regular pork sausage, I used the pre-cooked crumbled turkey sausage.  Not only does it save time, but it saves a lot of fat and calories too. I loaded the quiche with veggies: zuchinni, green onion, bell pepper and carrots.  By adding so many veggies, I was able to get 24 mini quiches out of this recipe.  By following a previous tip of putting the sausage mixture into the muffin tin and topping with egg, I had NO problem getting the quiches out of the pan.  I did not use any paper liners.  Once out of the oven, I flipped the quiches on to a baking sheet and put them in the freezer so I could then put them into a ziploc bag.  Making a big batch of these and freezing them allows me to have quiche anytime!  Just put two in the microwave for a minute and enjoy!",

I followed the recipe fairly close but made a few minor changes after reading all the reviews. First, I used half or the recommended sausage. Second, I did not use baking cups but sprayed a non-stick olive oil spray and had no problems. They came right out of the pan. Third, the only vegetable that I added were the green onions as this was a family brunch with a lot of young children attending. I used both cheddar (1/2 cup) and mozzarella (1/4 cup) and I sprinkled a small amount of grated parmesan cheese on top of the un-baked mixture. Then I baked them. I also added the southern style hash brown potatoes and it made twelve regular size quiches. Very good - everyone loved them and this will now be a holiday regular for us.",
