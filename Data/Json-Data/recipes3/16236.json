Lower the portion of swiss cheese and compensate with gruyere or emmental (my favorite), or any kind of firm cheese that suits your taste. Also, in addition to bread you can use crispy veggies or cold meats, like ham cubes. A good quality blond beer can also be used instead of the wine if you are a beer enthousiast. If you have never tried fondue before, stick to the wine.",

I wanted to try and counter all the fat from the cheese with some vegetables so along with dipping bread I steamed some brussel sprouts and dipped those in as well. YUMM!",
