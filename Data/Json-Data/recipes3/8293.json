However it's delicious nonetheless and a great way to perk up your popcorn. I used olive oil vs. veg. oil and doubled the recipe. I would definitely make this again and maybe add some dried chives to the mix. Perfect for a low fat snack!",

I tossed the air-popped popcorn with the melted butter/EVOO then sprinkled the seasoning over the top and tossed again. Not quite ranchy but tasty nonetheless. Next time I'd add chives along with onion powder or Beau Monde. Great for Movie Night made a little healthier.",

Once the seasonings appeared that they would sprinkle I added them to a popped bag of microwave popcorn and shook the bag. I used the whole recipe on one bag of popcorn and it seasoned it nicely. It was a new TASTY snack for tonight's ballgame that we really enjoyed. Thank you Leo M. Lalande for sharing your recipe.",

I made a small amount of popcorn and i made the seasoning as is with the oil the spices clumped up and didn't stick to the popcorn that great. i made another batch of seasoning and left the oil out and just sprayed the popcorn with butter spray and then tossed in the seasoning worked alot better.",
