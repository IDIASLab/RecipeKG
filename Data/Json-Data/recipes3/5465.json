I'd choose these pancakes over any made from a boxed mix or at a restaurant.  I don't keep WW pastery flour so I just use regular WW or sometimes white WW.  I've made it with both regular eggs and just egg whites and discovered that while the original recipe is good and fluffy, the pancakes are a bit lighter when I use only egg whites.  If you run out of buttermilk, this substitute works in a pinch: measure 2 Tbsp lemon into a large measuring glass, add enough milk to make it 2 cups, and let it sit for 5 min before using.",

I also tried it with regular whole wheat flour instead of the pastry trust me people you NEED to get the pastry flour--it makes all the difference). (Little add-ins & substitutions to suit my particular needs/preferences: added 2 tbs Splenda and 1 scoop of unflavored Whey Protein powder to get the protein/carb/fat ratios I need for my BFFM diet.) Who would have thought I could have pancakes on my diet? Absolutely sensational. Thanks again KayKwilts.",
