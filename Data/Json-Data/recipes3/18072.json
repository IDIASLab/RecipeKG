It is a raving success. \"Buster \" our 7 year old Beagle mix rescue dog devoured it on the very first serving and continues to do so. After several days on it now I can say that it treats him and his digestive system much better than the very expensive dry commercial dog food we were feeding him. This recipe is a bit time consuming and I will check this site for other dog recipes but I will make this one again. The only other issue is that he would not eat the kidney beans so I'll maybe double up on the rice. This recipe made 8 pints and he gets two of them a day. Checking on the calories this falls within the requirements for a 28 1/2 pound dog and allows for a milk bone or two a day. I'll do some checking on the need for any additives but like one blogger said \"Yeah and where do they come from?\" Thanks for a great recipe from me and from Buster- his tail wags constantly while \"dining\" now!!",

I decided to make this after I had been feeding her top of the line store bought dog food; she started itching herself excessively (even though she gets advantage regularly) and her ears were getting smelly and funky (even though I clean them with a solution regularly). I'm losing faith in commercial dog food and with all of the recalls lately, I'd rather feed my dog something I know is safe!  I used fresh broccoli and spinach and chopped them up into TINY pieces for my 4lb dog.   She gobbled this down so quickly, it was amazing. I will update my review after I've been feeding this to her for a while, but definitely the prettiest and best smelling dog food I've ever seen.",

I would leave out the beans. If you are looking for a dog food recipe because your dog does not respond well to store bought, (ie- skin problems, allergies, etc), you should try leaving out the beef and or chicken and trying alternate protiens like fish or venison. Also the pumpkin contains a LOT of fiber, which is great for a constipated dog, (in fact if your dog is ever constipated a can of pumpkin pie filling should do the trick), so a messier stool may result if you use too much. Also I would be very cautious with the cottage cheese as most dogs are lactose intolerant, but a tiny bit for texture would probably be alright.  Thanks for this recipe!!!! One more thing-the fish oil would deffinately be better than olive oil!",
