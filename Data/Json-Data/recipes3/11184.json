The texture wasn't quite the smooth custard-like texture I expect from a quiche so in that respect I was a little disappointed. I'll probably try it again and use individual custard cups to see if that would make any difference but I suspect it may have been the canned tomatoes. Even though I drained them well I wonder if the acidity might have changed the texture from what I'd normally expect. I have a feeling I might prefer to omit the tomatoes from the quiche mixture and put sliced fresh tomatoes on top instead. But that will take another test later.",

The mini quiches came out of the ramekins beautifully. No need to use a spatula. Had to increase the baking time a bit probably due to the excess liquid of the added/fresh veggies.
