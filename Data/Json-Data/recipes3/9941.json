I also: -cooked the ground turkey in a deep pan and used fresh onions to cook turkey in. Then I added rest of ingredients in a large pot and transfered turkey to the large put. -added fresh chopped green and red pepper after I cooked the ground turkey -replaced diced tomatoes with chilli flavoured diced tomatoes -didn't drain and rinse the beans -added a little cumin. I didn't use oregno. Hubby was skeptical while I was cooking but ended up loving it!:)",
