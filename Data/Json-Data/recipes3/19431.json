Wish I had taken the time.  Other reviewers are right in you really need more chocolate for the top.  Also, maybe because we lived in such a humid area, but I had trouble getting the peanut butter layer spread.  I ended up finding a plastic spatula sprayed with Pam worked the best.  Next time I will add the additional crumbs to stiffen up the mixture.  Also, hands do not work well, even when buttered because they heat up the peanut butter and cause it to release more oil.  These are super rich and I cut them into small pieces.  I figure I got twice the number the recipe stated.  These were super easy, fast, and I will sure keep them in mind for future use.  Last though, mine never really set up, so I ended up having to store them in the fridge.  Not a huge deal, but a thought if you are planning to take them somewhere.",

After melting the butter, I add the peanut butter to create a creamy mixture.  I combine my graham cracker crumbs and confectioners' sugar together in a separate bowl and then add these dry ingredients to the peanut butter/butter mixture.  The ingredients come together much better this way!  I agree with using 2 cups of chocolate chips and 1-2 tablespoons of butter for the topping.",

First, make sure your graham crumbs are extra fine (don't crush by hand - use the processor) Second, soften the peanut butter in the microwave before adding and the mixture will spread easier. Third, pour into a cookie sheet or 9x13 pan instead of a jelly roll pan (too thin!). Fourth, double the chocolate in the topping and only add 2 tbls butter (otherwise it's \"greasy\").",
