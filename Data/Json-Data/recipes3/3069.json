I only used a tablespoon or so and it was still the right texture and tasted excellent. The avocado was hard to notice if you like avocado I would add a little more. Otherwise I'd substitute the avocado for another vegetable and a little more oil. I added chili pepper flakes but added more than I thought! Just be careful if/when you add chili pepper it definitely makes it but its easy to go overboard. I also forgot the cilantro and I didn't notice it. As a side note if you've got the time and patience I'd cut the shrimp into smaller pieces. It makes it easier to eat and allows the aromatics to blend into the meat more quickly.",

I used less olive oil (not sure how much, but probably closer to 3 Tbs), let everything except the avocado marinate all day, then added the avocado and some lemon juice right before serving.
