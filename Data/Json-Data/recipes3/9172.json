I added some oregano, basil and garlic powder to the cheese mixture because that's what I do when I make my lasagna filling.  I made a few substitutions: penne instead of ziti; mixed grated Italian blend cheese for the mozzarella and used jar spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce.  Lastly I sprinked a combo of freshly grated parmesan, asiago and romano cheese on top instead of just parmesan.\n\nNext time I going to bake in a 9x13\" baking dish because it was just a bit much for a 2.5 quart and it took about 10 minutes longer to bake but I think a larger baking dish would eliminate the extra baking time.\n\nThanks for sharing your recipe!",

My kids and hubby thought it was pretty bland compared to other Italian dishes.",

                "reviewBody": "I think this is a great base recipe that leaves a lot of room for your own twists and preferences. I used Rao's jarred marinara sauce Sargentos 6 cheese blend instead of mozzarella and a tsp of my own Italian seasoning blend...along with a pinch of red pepper for a bit of heat. I found it very helpful to slightly undercook the pasta a bit because it will continue to cook in the oven and I didn't want it to turn to mush. I added both the cheese blend and Parmesan cheese on top as we like a lot of cheese in our baked pasta dishes. I didn't bother to measure the cheese on top - I just kept adding until it was covered to my liking. I baked it until the dish was bubbly and the top slightly browned (we like a good crust).. Everyone in my family loved it and my sons actually went back for thirds! I will definitely be making this again...easy fun and delicious!! Thanks for a great recipe.:)",
