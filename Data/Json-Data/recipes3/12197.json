The frypan method with five minutes on each side cooked the cod through. When I tried to switch it to the baking pan for the oven portion the cod fell apart.

Was a little stingy on butter, but sauteed the salted fillets in butter in cast iron pan skin side last so the meat side was up on the flip, then added the toppings except additional butter and cooked in the oven, leaving it in the cast iron pan (saved on dishes).
