I made half a recipe specifically for meatloaf sandwiches, good old-fashioned comfort food.  Since 1 lb will not fill up a regular-size loaf pan, I baked in two mini loaf pans and reached the 160 degree temperature in about 30 minutes.  The only change I made was using Heinz Chili Sauce instead of ketchup, and I might add a little chopped garlic next time.  If you don\u2019t overbake, this really is a moist meatloaf and made some tasty sandwiches.  Jessica, thanks for sharing your recipe.",

They turned out wonderful. I don't like meatloaf much but the fiance loves it so I try to make it occasionally. And i enjoyed this recipe! And the easiness of this recipe. Oh before i put the ketchup on top of the meat I spread a little brown sugar over it. Not much just enough to lightly cover the top. Then I put the ketchup on and baked it. And put more ketchup on near the end of baking too! I also added cheddar cheese to the mix. I've made this again tonight. In the oven right now!",
