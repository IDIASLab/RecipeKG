I used organic tomatoes. crushed low-salt Ritz crackers and added a teaspoon each of onion powder garlic powder dried oregano and a half teaspoon of dried basil just to jazz it up a bit. At the last minute I added 1/2 cup of shredded mozzerella as the cheese would have gone bad if I hadn't. I fried these in a mixture of extra virgin olive oil and butter. Huge hit with the kids. All I had to say to them was we were having cracker pancakes and they couldn't eat them fast enough. My husband was a harder sell but he was hungry so he ate whatever was left. He said \"It needs bacon\" so I might add some crumbled bacon next time. I made the Dill Sauce for Hamburgers to go with and it went together well. NOTE: if you use Ritz crackers be sure to use 1/3 more than you would have using saltines.",

I tried the recipe exactly, but with most of my different dry ingredients - realized I needed more since the patties kept sticking, something I noticed in other cook's reviews.  AWESOME!!!  Tried to take photo ops 2 times - 11 yr old daughter and BF kept eating them...until I finally realized that I had to hide them in order to take a pic.....was wondering why there were no pics on here - now I know why.....thought this was weird...tried something new....AMAZING!!!!",

I am teaching daughter to cook over summer break and this one was on her list. We were both so pleased with the results! We used italian flavored tinned tomatoes adding extra oregano basil cilantro paprika garlic and onion. I think next time we may even add a touch of parmesan. Instead of forming into patties we dropped them into oil by the spoonful and pressed them flat with the back of a spoon...we also found that making the patties smaller made them easier to flip. We topped ours with a dollop of sour cream but mayo blue cheese or mozerella would be nice too. I think perhaps these would even broil nicely in your oven. I like that I always have the ingredients for this recipe in my pantry since I can see we will be eating this alot! THANKS!!!!",

I wound up throwing in the entire sleeve of saltines as mine weren't pastey enough after 15 minutes (they might have set up after sitting longer but I didn't have the time.) I added a hint of fresh parmesan and just drizzled olive oil in the pan instead of using the full 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil. I will be making this again (at the request of my incredibly pickly husband.) I didn't try to really form patties with these (like I would with a hamburger) rather I just spooned them into the skillet. Great and cheap - the only two criteria needed for a recipe to make a repeat appearance on my dinner table. Thanks!",

(He doesn't like tomatoes anyway) I myself thought that the consistancy of the mixture was blah...It turned out mushy not crispy and I had my pan super heated. I might be able to get past the somewhat bland taste by adding some of the ingrediants other reviews have added but I couldn't handle the texture at all. I ended up throwing the rest of the batch out. I may or may not try this again but if I do I think I will definately add other ingrediants and an egg; maybe that will help.",
