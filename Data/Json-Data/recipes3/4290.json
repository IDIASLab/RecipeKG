I even used a little more sour cream to thicken the sauce and reduce the wine taste but the kids passed and the adults found it edible but were not thrilled. Maybe something other than sherry? The idea sounds good but I'm not sure what I could substitute to make it worthwhile making again. Thanks anyways!",

The ham seemed an unusual ingredient (besides the cola of course) but the two together gave it a bacon-y flavor. Excellent! I agree that it needed to be thickened a bit even after letting it reduce down so I added a flour/water slurry and it was perfect. Served it over egg noodles but over rice would probably be even better. Actually we loved the sauce so much I'd double it the next time. Make certain you pound the chicken like the recipe states...it makes them so much more tender. This one I'll make again!",
