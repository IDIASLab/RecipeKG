These remind me of your typical pot roast prep that your mom may have made growing up...if your mom happened to be a Korean man who went on to create the first fusion taco truck. Enjoy over a bed of steamed rice and your favorite banchan!",

These ribs were spot on delicious and my wife and I ate almost an entire rack of ribs. Although the recipe doesn't specify, I did cut the rib rack into individual ribs before cooking. I made the recipe as written and it was fantastic. A side of brown rice, Kimchi, and Brussel sprout slaw made a first class meal. This is a do over for us.",
