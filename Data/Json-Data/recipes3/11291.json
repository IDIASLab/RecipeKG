I had a touch of salmon left over from last night's dinner and wanted to use that up but it wasn't enough so I also had a 7-oz can of tuna that I used too. Also I opted for the submitter's suggestion of using grapes. I portioned out all the ingredients from the mayo down and added some to the salmon and the rest to the tuna for our lunch today. Both were good though my husband preferred the mix with the tuna. This is a nice take of the protein salad mixes that are out there. I would make this again! Thanks for our lunch CARLISFAMILY!",
