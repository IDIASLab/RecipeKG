I wanted to ensure a good crisp, so I cut my wedges a bit thinner and need MUCH less baking time (they were a tad dark brown at 20 min when I went to flip).  No error in time, just a heads up as all potatoes/cuts will be different, so keep an eye on them the first time you make them.  I followed the recipe, though I used jarred minced garlic (what I had) and eliminated the black pepper, per personal preference.  Mr. LTH ate these as is and I dipped them in a mixture of mayo/ketchup/yellow mustard along side our burgers.  Thanks for the recipe, KBT24!",

I halved the recipe because it was just me and it was too much to eat even though it was delicious. After tossing the potatoes in olive oil I added the full tsp of garlic (yay garlic) all the seasonings except the onion powder which I didn't have. I forgot the pepper (oops) but added 1/8 tsp of Cayenne Powder - which was plenty and I like spice. The potatoes definitely needed a dipping sauce - next time I might try a couple of the other reviewers' suggestions like microwaving or boiling the slices first in an attempt to retain some more moisture. Still yum! Will keep this in my recipe box.",
