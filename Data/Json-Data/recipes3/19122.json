It's just dry as is.  And I couldn't taste the Parmesan nor the bacon (even subtly).  So all in all it was like having pasta with a few crunchy things and only a bit of flavor, sorry.

                "reviewBody": "3-16-2016 ~When you need a good, reliable pasta salad (meaning one most people are likely to like) this is a good choice.  The idea of this is very familiar to me and brought back fond memories of a very similar Parmesan Peppercorn Ranch boxed pasta salad I used to make years ago when my kids were young (affectionately known in our house as \u201cParm Pep\u201d) The only thing they would not eat was peas, so I painstakingly picked every single one of those dehydrated things out before the contents of the bag went into the boiling water.  This time I made a point to ADD peas for all the times I picked them out!  Can\u2019t go wrong with this pasta salad, particularly if you use a dressing you know you like. In my case, I happened to have \u201cLow Fat Buttermilk Ranch Dressing,\u201d also from this site, on hand. This had a little too much Parmesan for me, so I would suggest starting off with less than the recipe calls for, then adding more if you wish.  Rather than dicing the carrots I julienned them, which appealed to me more than crunchy/hard pieces.  A helpful tip: many reviewers remarked they had to add much more dressing than the recipe directs because the pasta soaked it up.  Rather than doing that, I do the same thing with pasta salads as I do with any other pasta dish \u2013 reserve some of the cooking water and add that to your pasta salad if it gets too dry after setting awhile.  Works great, much better than milk for instance, and this way you don\u2019t load it up with extra dressing.",
