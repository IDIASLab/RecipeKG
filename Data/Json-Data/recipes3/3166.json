However, to indulge my wife's Mother's recipe I made couple of addtions in ingredients as well as sequence steps:\n\nWithin the celery volume I added cellery leaves.\n\nI added 1/2 cup of minced parsley.\n\nI shortened the drying time by first toasting all the bread to a light brown color...and then placing the slices in a large casserole dish in the microwave on a medium setting for 5 minutes. Then repeating it as needed until the bread was rigid when the microwave power was interrupted by opening the door and checking. That saved the 24hr drying time and brought it down into about 20 minutes.\n\nI did not use a rolling pin to crush the bread into total crumbs, but crushed it by hand until there were crumbs and pieces in the bowl. Pieces were never larger than the average thumbnail and there were a lot of crumbs.\n\nAfter placing the crushed bread in a bowl, add the dry ingredient-spices and thoroughly mix them together before adding the eggs and chicken broth.\n\nThen mix the eggs and chicken broth together before adding to the crumb-spice mixture.\n\nThen add the results of the sauted onion-celery mix without draining it.\n\nAdd more water if needed at this point so the resultant stuffing is moist and clumps together, but is not a mushy mess.\n\nFour family traditions loved it!!",

Her instructions were to add the broth in, cup by cup and when I could take two hands, grab some stuffing and form a softball size ball that held together, that was enough liquid.  I have used the same \"measurement\" for 30+ years and everyone loves it.  Always moist.  Enjoy!",
