There is just a \"different\" taste about them that pairs really nicely with the brandy. Also I was lazy and skipped the confectioners' sugar at the end. I don't need cookies to be super sweet and thought they tasted fine without the extra sugar. This is quite a unique combination and I will definitely be using this recipe again. I just wish black walnuts were a little cheaper!",
