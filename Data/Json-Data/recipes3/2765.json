I'm also going to try this with salmon the next time I do it. Thanks for an interesting recipe!",

I didn't make the sauce & used a 12oz can chunk light tuna & a \"10 pack\" of buttermilk biscuits. They are surprising (suspiciously:D) similar to cresent rolls when flattened. I oiled the pan a little & baked 'em about 25 minutes. For the filling I used the tuna 3/4t salt 1/2t pepper a cup of cheddar & just one egg. I let that sit a while in the refrig to plump up the cheese & help it hold its shape. I made goodsize - inch or more - tuna \"meatballs.\" Placed them in the center & pulled up from the sides four times (imagine a square) gave them a pinch & a twist then baked. If I hadn't put the biscuits on the oiled pan then filled they all would've stayed together; but oil got on the corners I was trying to seal so a couple openned. The intact ones were cute! I sprinkled sesame seeds over the top before baking too. The taste wasn't \"wow \" but it's a new way to serve tuna - that those kids will eat - at least mine - & that's saying something!:) Of course I suppose most kids would eat anything wrapped in a biscuit or cresent roll.
