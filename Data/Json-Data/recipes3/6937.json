I added diced onion to the vegetables and upped the amount of asparagus and mushrooms, which is recommended. And if possible, add some shredded salmon on top of the pasta before placing the scallops and sauce on top as is seen in my photo for this recipe. It was a delicious idea that worked magnificently. . .",

My store was out of mascarpone cheese so I used 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 heavy cream, and 3tbsp sour cream... it makes more sauce and I highly suggest it!  I used 2 garlic cloves instead of one and used Farfalle pasta instead.  Amazing and delicious!  Top with some parmesan cheese and you are good to go!  SUCH a tasty meal!  I also tried a reviewer's suggestion and added some flaked salmon on top!  PERFECTION!  Thanks so much for the recipe!",
