Only used 1 can of black beans, left out the mustard and used 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs in place of the oats. After I made the patties I dredged them in more panko's so they would be crispy on the top. Only using one can of black beans, it still made 6 (thinner) patties. When it was done, I chose not to put on a roll but instead put mango salsa on top....OMG.... delish!!!",

The flavor is great - the added cinnamon is a great idea that brings out the other spices very nicely. To give it a bit more of a smoky meaty flavor I added 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic powder and smoked Spanish paprika. This was a hit with the family!",

I cooked them in a cast iron pan so I wouldn't heat up my kitchen with the oven. The burgers didn't get super firm but they were FANTASTIC! The recipe made 7 burgers each made with 1/2 cup of mix.",
