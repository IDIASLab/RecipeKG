I'll make it again.  I did increase the spices quite a bit after tasting finished dish...didn't measure, just \"palmed it\".  Have to admit that the aroma while cooking had me wondering if I'd made a mistake...the combination of spices smelled kinda strange to me, did again when opening leftovers, but I do like the flavor.  It's one of those flavors that I found growing on me more with each bite.  Increasing the spices considerably didn't drastically change the flavor as much as I thought it would...even though I could feel the beginning of heat in my mouth.  Sent leftovers with daughter for school lunch today...waiting to see what she thinks.  I used raisins and think that, like others, they add a definite depth to the flavor that's important (and I usually don't care for raisins much).  Didn't have any pine nuts so couldn't add those, but will definitely next time...and there will be a next time.  Thanks for the recipe!!  I've been looking to increase our use of quinoa.  UPDATE  I changed the rating to a 5.  My daughter really likes this for her school lunch.  I've made it a few more times and have added pine nuts...they do add another layer of flavor/texture that we like.  This is going into our regular rotation making sure to cook for leftovers. ",

I didn't have garbanzo beans so I used spicy black beans. I doubled the spices and used half to season 3 chicken breasts then grilled them on the Foreman grill. Sliced and served chicken on top. The raisins add a burst of sweetness with the spiciness and it's so YUM!! What a meal.",
