We loved the flavor of parsley, dill, & onion (& 1/2 tsp garlic powder added) in these fun little savory bites.  To make this simple, I put the dried seasonings in a ziploc bag, then threw in the biscuit pieces & tossed them around to coat.  Then I put them in the pan & poured the melted butter evenly over the tops.  Worked out great!  Thanks for this easy & quick recipe!  Will use it again for sure!  :)",
