A few \"family hints\": add 1 or 2 whole lemons (just cut them in half and drop 'em in), 2 or 3 medium size onions(quartered), two datil peppers (these are a florida thang) and leave the heads and shells on the shrimp for more flavor (wash them before cooking of course, but peel 'em on your plate. Although I have to admit, I like it when the heads aren't on - they look at me otherwise and I feel sorry for them!), You can omit the crabs if you want(or leave them in) or you can use whole crawfish like another review suggested. We also use the boil-in-bag bay seasoning..it's easier! \nThis meal IS best served by dumping it in the middle of the table on newspaper and then everyone just grabs a paper plate and loads up! I promise you, you won't be sorry if you make these additions! \n\nNow THAT is a lo' country boil Florida style!",

I used turkey kielbasa (to cut down on the fat), shrimp, clams, sea scallops and a baby lobster tail per person. It was to die for! I suggest using a turkey fryer as it has the basket with holes in it and you don't have to worry about dumping out the water and keeping the food in the pot. You can't go wrong...add whatever seafood and spices you have and it's perfect. Wonderful recipe to feed a crowd!",

We ate it all the time until we moved back to NY, where you CANNOT find lowcountry boils!!! I was having a pregnancy craving for this dish and made it last night for dinner. It's been nearly a year without us having this dish and it is GREAT! This recipe was very similar to the taste of the boils we ordered at The Crab Shack (not the chain) on Tybee Island, GA! Wonderful blend of tastes and I WILL use this recipe again!",

Once boiling I added the 5 lbs of quartered potato's and the lemons and cooked for 10 minutes. I then added the precooked kelbasa and onions and cooked for another 5 minutes. Finished it off with the shrimp, crab legs, and mussels cooking for another 5 minutes and sitting for a final 5 in the pot.
