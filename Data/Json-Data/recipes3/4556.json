I doubled the garlic, used finely crush dried rosemary and sprinkled with some garlic salt after pouring on the tomato sauce. I suggest you keep a thermometer in the meat and keep an eye on it. Everyone's oven is a little different. 4 hours would have been way past well done for my roast. This is a fabulous roast for Sunday supper! I'll do it again and again..rave reviews from the family. Garlic, Italian herbs, cayenne, salt and olive oil on baby red potatoes is a great compliment..put into oven last hour of lamb roast. EASY and elegant",

Lamb shhoud be \"crusty\" on the outside and slightly pink in the middle. I thought this was a great basic recipe. I do like to roast lamb on a rack over a pan which adds a \"convection effect\" on a standard oven. Even using true convestion this meathod has turned out best for me. Again nice recipe.",
