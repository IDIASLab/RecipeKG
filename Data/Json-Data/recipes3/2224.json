I didn't have the pork loin so I chopped up some pork chops and I didn't have the beef stew meat so I used ground beef. I cut the receipe in half and followed the rest of the directions. It came out fantastic. This is a wonderful stew. Very satisify on a cold day. I served this stew with homemade bread right out of the oven. Ummmm!!!!!! ( I used the Crusty Bread Receipe from this site also. Very good bread.)",
