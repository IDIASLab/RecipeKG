The first day I made it I was a bit disappointed because it was a little TOO horseradishy. But the next day either it was milder or I was more in the mood for it or something. Now I find it delicious. I made it with nonfat yogurt nonfat sour cream and regular Miracle Whip dressing. I used Beaver Cream Style Horseradish sauce since that is what I had on hand. It was strong enough that I may try a little less horseradish next time. With my changes to nonfat ingredients by my calculations there are 70 calories in 50 grams. I am not a scientist though but that is what I am using for my calorie calculations.",
