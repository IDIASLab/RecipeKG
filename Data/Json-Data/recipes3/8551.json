Also used hashbrowns as the shell used a oblong pan and just cooked them in the pan for about 15 minutes before adding the other layers. Also used more eggs because we had to use them up. Glad we did. We did use Canadian Bacon but really chopped ham or bacon would have worked too. Definitely will make this again since it was easy and satisfied.",
