Unbelievably, I didn't have any carrots on hand so, in the interest of adding something orange, I chopped up about 1/2 cup of orange bell pepper instead.   Omitted the 1/2 tsp salt as the consomme is loaded with sodium already.   Also, to save time and washing, I used an oven-proof skillet and did everything in one pan.   It was so good!  My husband likened it to Chinese fried rice \"but much better, lighter and not greasy.\"  Next time I will add more almonds for more crunch and flavor.  I served this with grilled chicken breasts with a ranch-mustard sauce.  Thanks, kbalbi, for a delicious recipe!",

Instead of butter I used Extra virgin Olive Oil. I added a dash of cayenne pepper and turmeric just because these are very good for your health. I threw everything (but the almonds) in a rice cooker and voila! Almonds went in at the end. It is a light recipe fresh in flavor but with a little crunchiness from the almonds and a little kick from the cayenne pepper. In the Caribbean we eat rice with avocado so if you have never tried this combination before go for it I promise you won't be disappointed. It was simply Delicious! my daughter couldn't stop talking about how good it was. Will definitely do it again.",
