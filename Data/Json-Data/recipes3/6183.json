When I once more asked her in my fifties she said \"I like mashed potatoes and I really love turnip but I don't like carrots at all. So Nannie made this combination so I would \"eat those carrots!!\" When I became a mother I did the same thing so that I could \"eat my carrots\" and never let the children know that I didn't like 'em.\"See what a mother will do for her children?\"",
