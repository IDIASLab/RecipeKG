I have a particular resturant that I love to eat at because of their spicy shrimp pasta now.... I have a simple recipe on how to make it myself! Thanks for the recipe it was a hit in my home my boyfriend absolutely loved it and my friends want me to make it again! Only one bit of advice though watch the heat when your heating up the flavors or you could burn it and practically choke to death from the smoke it creates in the house! Also add flour to your liking to thinken the sauce so that it won't be so runny. Other than that.... definitely two thumbs up will be making this again and again.....",
