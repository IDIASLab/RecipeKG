I did the recipe as close as I could to begin with except I used Zinfandel instead of Rose' because I couldn't find any in 4 stores here in Hawai'i. After the initial double recipe was made I knew it wasn't going to be enough, so I add 1/2 bottle of leftover  Merlot, 1 bottle of Chardonnay, another 1/2 cup of vodka, and 2 extra cups of pineapple juice. The party was BYOB, but the punch bowl was empty before the party was over! Was asked several time where the recipe came from.",

Several notes for y'all: 1) Doubling the recipe doesn't necessarily mean doubling the fruit. Next time: 2) I might skip (or at least lessen) the simple syrup as it made it a tad too sweet for my personal taste especially since I plan to 3) make ice cubes out of the remaining pineapple juice that I will add to the Sangria at the last minute; 4) and I will serve it in a punch bowl so that my guests can get a couple pieces of fruit with each cup. 5) A 9-oz. clear plastic cup short and wide at the top is the perfect sized cup to enjoy this delightful Sangria at an outdoor gathering. Yum! If this matters to you because of the pineapple juice the Sangria is cloudier in appearance than the photo might indicate.",
