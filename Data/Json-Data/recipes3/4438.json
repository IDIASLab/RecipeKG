The sheer ease of making the sauce and the ingredients makes this a winner.  I skipped the whole roux making and did as follows.     I sauteed the shallots in butter and added about 2 cloves of garlic.  Added the wine and reduced it by about half.  Mixed a few tablespoons of flour into the fat free half and half (didn't use heavy cream no need for Xtra fat) and poured the mixture into the saute pan.   Cooked it a few more minutes until it thickened.  Do not boil. Just simmer.  I added fresh chopped parsley at the very end. Didn't use thyme b/c I thought it might interfere with the lobster raviolis I was using. Very easy sauce and good for practically anytype of light seafood such as sea bass, tilapia and even shrimp. Thanks for sharing.  Will use this recipe again.",

First of all why did I have to make so much roux when I only needed two or three tablespoons? And after adding the roux and thickening the sauce why did it say to cook five more minutes to eliminate the starchy taste when I already did that by cooking the roux until it was brown to begin with? It's a nice sauce but I think this recipe needs some serious editing.",
