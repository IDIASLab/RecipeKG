I also substituted some anchovy paste for the actual anchovy fillets. I used the Italian salad dressing mix recipe from this site to make the dressing which was really good.

Tilapia can be a little bland if not seasoned well. I prefer more of a fried flavor but it is very healthy this way! I am considering using my favorite fish sticks in place of the tilapia next time. We also used some hot sauce and that gave the pitas a real kick.",
