                "reviewBody": "Very close...\n \nIf you haven't been pleased with this recipe I suggest these adjustments.\n\nFor 8 servings, use 4 thin slices of salt pork, cut into small dice and \"tried out\" i.e. fried on very low heat until the fat is rendered. \n\nDiscard rendered salty fat and set the crisp pork aside on double layer of paper towel. \n\nTry to use salt pork, it's the original ingredient and lends a subtle deliciousness to the chowder. Fish chowder is about sweet fish not salty smoked bacon. \n\nIf you must use bacon, use only 2 or 3 slices and don't use hickory smoked, maple smoked, apple smoked, honey smoked or any other flavored bacon, but just plain bacon. And render the fat and throw it away because it will be too salty for this soup. Dice the cooked bacon and add as explained further on.  \n\nDon't try to make chowder in an hour, or even two hours, or even for supper the same day you make it. Chowder's flabor needs time to develop because of its simple ingredients. It's not a dish to rush if you want it to be good. \n\nUse Spanish onion (about1 1/2 cups diced)for 8-servings). \n\nSweat the onion for about 5-10 minutes over very low heat using the 2 tablespoons of butter listed in Cathy's recipe. No substitutions - you'll remove the butter later, cross my heart.\n\nAfter onions are softened put them into a pan-sprayed heavy-bottomed Dutch oven, put in the fish which should be in very large pieces (thick fillets cut into 3 pieces each - I buy a big package at Sam's Club and use it all for one chowde",
