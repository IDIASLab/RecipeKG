I do not add it anymore, and we like it better.  Can easily add another square of chocolate for even fudgier frosting.  I often halve the sugar & butter and use 2 sqs. of chocolate for 13X9 cakes.  Save a lot of fat gms. and calories, and my husband never knows the difference.  If you make a layer cake, you must use the full recipe.  I usually need only 1/3 C milk for the right consistency.  Whip the frosting on high for a couple of mins. to make it fluffier.",

I had to make a birthday cake for someone who loves chocolate - oh my, this one requires a big glass of milk alongside.  I actually doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough to frost a layer cake, and I ended up only adding the first amount of milk because I thought it appeared too thin.  As it began to set, it was just perfect.  Once I had the layers frosted, I thinned out a portion to use for piping and decorating, because I was afraid it wouldn't come through the tip, and it was perfect.  This is now my chocolate frosting recipe.  And anyone who said it wasn't sweet enough is just crazy.",
