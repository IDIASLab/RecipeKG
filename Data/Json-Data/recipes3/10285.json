I typically follow the recipe the first time through particularly if I m the first reviewer but I just knew that 2 tsp of salt would be too much for us for such a small roast so I cut that in half and moving forward I d cut it to 1/2 tsp (this could be personal taste preference). We re pepper lovers here so I left the 1-1/2 tsp pepper as is and would do so again. I measured out about 1 cup of gingersnap crumbs and used about half of that to coat the roast. Lot of oil left in the skillet after browning the roast so I d try 2 Tbsp of oil in the future. It took 35 miinutes to reach the 145\u00ba temperature but then it sat for quite a while waiting for my sweet potatoes to finish cooking. As a result the photo may make the roast look not so pink but that s a result of waiting for the potatoes not the recipe's fault. However it still was juicy and tender. The sauce was absolutely succulent and delicious. I didn t have apple cider used apple juice and I did thicken it slightly with a flour slurry for a nice pan sauce. This was very good and I would make again.",

I didn\u2019t have gingersnap cookies, so I used normal breadcrumbs with a touch of sugar. I also didn\u2019t have currants so just left those out, but otherwise followed directions exactly and it was wonderful. Perfectly cooked, wonderful flavor, a big hit at dinnertime.",
