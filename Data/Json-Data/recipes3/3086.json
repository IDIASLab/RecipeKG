I made it for the first time last week and followed the directions exactly, except that I had to nearly double the cooking time.  I came back to AR and looked at other reviews and decided to try again.  So, I made this recipe again last night and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of vanilla.  I also melted one Tbsp butter in a glass pie plate in the oven while the oven was heating up.  I then poured in the batter, added about 15 minutes to the cooking time, and wow!  They really puffed up this time and had a much better consistency and taste.  I just served with butter and a little powdered sugar.  I will definitely be making these again and again!",

Much less messy than pouring pancakes and easier to cook.  Great texture.  I used a 9 inch cake pan, which worked well.  Tasted great with butter and syrup.  Perfect for a family of four, especially if served with fruit and a breakfast meat.  Will definitely become a breakfast staple.",
