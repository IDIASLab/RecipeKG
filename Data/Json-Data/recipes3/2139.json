Only things I did differently was sliced turkey breast instead of the bacon(used 3 slices louis rich)and monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar. I also added some of Emeril's Essence to it. Overall it was very easy to make everyone loved it and maybe next time I will use some habanero sauce in it. Also about 1/3 of an onion was enough for the church group I took it to. If I was making it for around the house I would have used the whole onion though. I recommend this to anyone who wants a tasty quiche.",

This filling could make two pans if you're not careful. I suggest a deep-dish and add the evaporated milk until it's \"full\".
