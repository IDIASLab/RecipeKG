Spray the aluminum foil with spray because the chicken will also stick to it.",

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly (but doubled for a big family). It was good, but seemed to be missing something. Since then, I have always added some Italian Seasoning, Paprika, and bread crumbs to the dry mixture. This makes the right mixture for me, and still produces extremely good chicken. I usually pour any remaining dry mixture on top of the chicken before putting it in to bake. I usually make this with thighs and legs. This is a regular in my monthly menu for \"Fried Chicken Friday\" where I generally serve a different fried/oven baked chicken recipe each Friday. Also, I have never had a problem with mushy coating. There will always be a little mushiness because of the juices from the chicken cooking out, but it is usually minimal, and typical of oven baked and coated chicken. I would say it is best to always use foil instead of a greased pan. You don't have to spray the foil either, that will help reduce the moisture in the pan and keep the potato flakes from reconstituting.",

I also added dried parsley (for apperance), dried basil(for flavor), black pepper(for kick) and paparika(for color).  This recipe is a keeper.

I added Italian seasoning a tiny dash of poultry seasoning and a healthy pinch of dried rosemary - crush it in your palm before adding to the mix which will release the flavor as well as saving someone from getting a giant pine needle stuck in their teeth! I sprinkled the leftover potato mixture over the top of the chicken pieces in the pan which made for extra crispiness and flavor. I can't wait to try this with flavored potatoes as another reviewer mentioned. Super fast prep and a tasty dinner.",

                "reviewBody": "This was a good recipe base.  However, based on other reviews I tweaked and combined recipe methods to come up with a really great recipe.  First, melt the butter, adding 2 Tbsp of canola oil to help prevent butter from over browning, and pour into bottom of baking dish coated with cooking spray. TO KEEP THE COATING FROM COMING OFF WHILE BAKING: First place about 1/3 to 1/2 cup flour in a dish big enough to for the chicken breast to comfortably fit in. Next, place 1 egg in a similar dish and beat egg well. Then place coating mixture in a third similar dish. Dip each chicken breast into flour, egg and then coating. Then place into prepared pan.  THEN TO IMPROVE FLAVOR:  If anyone has the all|recipes Family Favorites Cookbook published in 2005, look on page 183 - this exact recipe is printed differently - the one in the book has printed to add 1/4 tsp each of dried time and rosemary. I also made a couple of additions: 1/4 tsp sweet paprika, 1/2 Itailian seasoning, 1/4 tsp salt-free all-purpose seasoning and 1/4 tsp ground shallots and I also added 8 crushed saltine crackers.  Then I baked for 30 minutes and turned to bake on the otherside for 15 minutes, then I turned them again and baked an additional 10 minutes. I know this sounds like alot of extra to do, but my family really liked it. Hope this helps.  Thanks for sharing the recipe - very versatile :0)",
