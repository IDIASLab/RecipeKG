One of my roommates is lactose intolerant (so obviously, he can't have cheese).  I bought some tofu and substituted it for the goat cheese in his \"stuffed tomatoes\".  I was a little worried how it would turn out, in fact I told him that if it was \"gross\" that he didn't have to eat it.  I stuffed one tomato for him and had him try it, and he thought it was GREAT.  The only change he would make is that next time I should buy the \"extra firm\" tofu instead of the \"firm\" tofu.  So I was pleasantly surprised that the substitution worked.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It was easier than I thought it would be!",
