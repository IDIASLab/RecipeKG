For a glaze, microwave the chips and syrup together until melted. Then add all the butter and stir like crazy. For a thick fudgy frosting, melt the chips, then add the corn syrup and stir. It will seem too thick. Then add the butter about a teaspoon at a time until you get the consistency you want. It's tasty either way.",
