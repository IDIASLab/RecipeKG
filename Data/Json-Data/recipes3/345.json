To make flowers, etc, put the frosting in the fridge (best in a stainless steel bowl) for about 20 minutes, then beat on medium for about 15 seconds - viola!  However, if you have warm hands like me, you need to be able to work a little fast.  Once finished, refridgerate cake until an hour before serving.  Unless drastic temperature change, colors won't bleed and decorations retain shape.  HINT: add just a tad bit more flour to the cream mixture.",

I'm going to try the recipe again but with only 3 tablespoons flour and with butter in place of some of the shortening. Also, I doubled the amount of vanilla. I would also add at least 1/2 cup more powdered sugar. The recipe is a great starting place, just needs a little refinement.",

I think this is as close as I am going to get!\r\n\r\nI used regular butter (I did not have unsalted on hand) and butter flavored Crisco. There was enough to frost a 2 layer 8\" round. It was smooth and creamy. \r\n\r\nIt was not stiff enough to decorate with, unless whatever was not in the bag was put in the fridge. It was way too soft for flowers. I combined it with a regular shortening based buttercream for decorating. (I chose a basketweave on the sides and roses on top.)\r\n\r\nThanks so much for a great recipe! \r\n\r\nP.S.

I made this recipe with the whisk attachment on my Kitchenaid, and it came out much creamier and smoother than regular buttercream.. great consistency.  However, I would NOT say it isn't as sweet.  I did use a little extra powdered sugar since some reviewers said to add more, and I think it was overkill.  Icing the cake was very easy, especially for perfectionists like me who are never satisfied with the way it looks.  It didn't crust over and I could re-smooth it over and over.  I frosted the cake 2 days before my son's birthday party and put it in the fridge, took it out for a couple of hours the day before to decorate it (with regular buttercream), and then took it out of the fridge about 30 minutes before serving.  The frosting tasted the same as it did the day I made it.  I will definitely use this recipe again, with a little less sugar and maybe a touch more vanilla. I changed the servings to 18 to make sure I had enough to frost a 2-layer 9x13 cake, and I had about 1 cup left over. Great recipe - thank you!!",

I assume the flour is added to give structure in light of there not being enough sugar for the large amount of butter/shortening. The lack of sugar butter/shortening overload and funky flour texture/taste combined with the half cup of cream makes this super soft very greasy and not nearly sweet enough (I have zero sweet tooth so if I'm saying it's not sweet enough there's a problem). And not to be nitpicky but French buttercream is made by beating a sugar syrup into egg yolks then adding softened butter. This isn't it.",

I like a more whipped cream flavor so I always make the following changes: #1 - Omit the butter flavor extract and increase the vanilla to 2 tsp. #2 - I also add 1/8 more whipped cream to recipe to boost cream whipped cream flavor. Some popular variations I've done: Add seedless strawberry jam for an awesome cake filling or reduce shortening to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup cream cheese (MUST be room temp) to give more stability for many layers. To better transport the finished product I'll refrigerate or freeze prior to moving it.",
