These turned out good but the would have been better if I would have used the entire slice of cheese. You expect a cheesesteak to be oozing with melty cheese and these were not. I'm still giving this 4 stars but I do recommend the one change. Lay half of the cheese down first and then the meat mixture as the recipe instructs but then take the other half of the cheese slice and lay it on top of the meat mixture before rolling.",

When I put the meat in the wrappers I usually use a    cookie size scooper and put two scoops in. I use a little more cheese, peppers and onions. I cook mine in ghee. I usually get about  15 of these from one pound of beef. The kids love them too....5 stars with my family.",
