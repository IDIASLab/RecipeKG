I used fresh tomatoes since they were starting to look sad, and I add red and orange bell peppers for the same reason.  Bc I added more ingredients, I upped the capers--shouldve done the same with the sage.  Perhaps bc I used raw tomatoes, I added about half a can of V8 juice; the liquid really cooked down quickly and since I wanted to cook as directed, I added tomato juice, which kept it moist.  I didn't find this to be too salty from the capers and tomato juice; I thought it was just right.  I almost never add salt and pepper in recipes unless it is added in the beginning; I prefer to let pple decide at the table if it needs more salt.  I'm glad I left it out this time.  I don't have linguine, or even spaghetti, so I used mini penne and felt it worked well.  Although I did add veggies to this, I think this makes more like four servings; that's okay, I can have for lunches at work this week.  Thanks for the recipe!",
