I did have to change a few things, but nothing major...I used a bagged slaw mix and I omitted the celery b/c I was out of it. Also, I didn't have chives on hand, so I used green onions (about 4 b/c I love an onion-y flavor in my slaw. As for the honey-Dijon mustard, well, I didn't have any of that either, lol, but I did have regular Dijon mustard AND honey on hand, so I made some up and proceeded w/ the recipe. Don't skip toasting the almonds, as they really give this a wonderful nutty flavor. Great mix of flavors and textures. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
