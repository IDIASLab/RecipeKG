Use frozen chicken breast (in the bag) pour salsa on top cover with foil cook for 1 hour at 350. NEVER dry when cooked this way. If you want a little extra flavor season with a little chili powder cumin and garlic before adding salsa. Not necessary but adds some great flavor. I like to slice the chicken and use for fajitas. So easy. For an Italian version use pasta sauce to cook chicken and serve over noodles. Definitely a great way to cook a great meal especially when you're short on time.",
