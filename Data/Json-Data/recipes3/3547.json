Ate with Ritz crackers. Sooo good and I even forgot the dill weed. I added about 1/2 tsp dill weed in the morning and it is beyond delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!! Try it with my changes! UPDATE: we ate a half batch so fast so the next day I made a double batch. You have to go easy on the citrus since not all lemons and limes are the same size or as juicy. I also used fresh cilantro instead of dill weed.",
