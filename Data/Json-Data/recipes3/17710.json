I really didn't think that the thyme would add anything to the fries and I was so wrong. I followed Baking Nana's advice and put the potatoes into water after peeling and then again after cutting. I did cut the recipe back by half but otherwise followed it as written. Great simple recipe and so easy. I am really looking forward to trying the sweet potato version. Thanks for sharing. Update: I made the sweet potato version today. The cinnamon didn't appeal to me so I used 1/2 tsp each salt pepper smoked paprika and garlic powder. Great flavour but I found that they didn't crisp up as much as the white version. Definitely a keeper.",
