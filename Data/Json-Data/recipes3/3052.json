                "reviewBody": "This recipe assumes knowledge not everyone will have.  For instance, you should brown the flour in the drippings, and use your whisk to break up all lumps during that stage.  If you wait until you add milk to break up the lumps, forget it -- they won't break!  Once you've made a \"roux\" with your flour and drippings, you can add milk.  Good tip:  The consistency of the roux will likely match the consistency of your gravy when finished.  Thick roux equals thick gravy, etc.  Please, please never be tempted to add water to make southern-style sausage gravy.  Mix the milk into the roux with your whisk.  I never measure for a recipe like this -- just eyeball it.  If it won't thicken you can add cornstarch mixed with water, but it's better just to add your milk incrementially.  If it's too thick the addition of more milk will take care of it.  Serve over buttermilk biscuits and you have one of the most delightful comfort foods known to man.  3 stars because it needs more instructions.",

I browned the sausage, added the flour and mixed it until I couldn't see the white of the flour anymore.  I then added the milk 1/2 cup at a time. I stirred until it was thick and boiling, turned it down and added some pepper.  I didn't add any salt; it didn't need any.  I used mild sausage.  I think it would have been better had I used a flavored sausage or maybe hot.  Anyway, it was very good and I will be making it again.",

Also I suggest using one pound of regular sausage and one pound of hot or spicy sausage then brown it with some chopped onions. Finally as Flobees suggests add the flour to the sausage after the sausage is browned (make sure the sausage is coated) and then add the milk. You shouldn't have a problem with lumps (just don't add additional flour after adding the milk!) I usually use 4 tablespoons of flour and 4 cups of milk.",
