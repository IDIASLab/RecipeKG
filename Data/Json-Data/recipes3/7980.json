I would not plan on serving this warm as the shredded cheese will just melt into little blobs throughout the pasta - it did for ours. IF you do make this and plan to serve it as a cold salad DO cool the pasta well first. Second if you serve it as a cold salad it definitely needs some kind of dressing. Lime juice flavor cooks away when it was heated. I'd save the lime juice to make some kind of dressing with it. Although we attempted to eat this and enjoy it with grilled chicken as a \"warm salad \" it wasn't really enjoyable. I ended up adding the leftovers to chicken tortilla soup which was much much better. It sounded like a good idea but just didn't work. It just needs too much doctoring.",
