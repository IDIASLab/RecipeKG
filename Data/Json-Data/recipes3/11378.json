I baked the first batch for the full 8 minutes, but they were too dark on the bottom and had a few burned spots on the top, so I baked the second batch for 5 minutes and let them rest on the pan for another 2 minutes before moving them. They were still extremely gooey, but a beautiful golden brown and firmed up nicely. My middle son ate that whole second batch (6 cookies!!). I added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead (because I LOVE chocolate chips). I did use Nestle Semi-Sweet because I really wanted a cookie recipe that just didn't have flour. This FIT the bill!! My dad is allergic to wheat, and he thought they were really good. I think you could really do a lot of different things with this base cookie recipe. Loved it! Thanks so much!!",
