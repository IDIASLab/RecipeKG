Went well with chips and if I make baked potatoes within the next day or two (and if I still have any of this dip left) I see how well they do as a topper. Overall pretty good and easy recipe.

I wish it was MSG-free because I just couldn't get the right mix of garlic & onion powders and salt. My husband enjoyed it but he loves sour cream.
