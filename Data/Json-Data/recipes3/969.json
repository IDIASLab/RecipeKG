There were a few modifications: When I sliced the bananas I tossed them in lemon juice and a little confectioner's sugar before layering them on the crust bottom. Also we only had an 8 oz. tub of whipped topping so I used that and found the cream cheese mixture hard to \"spread\" on the bananas -- I think it would have been more spreadable if I'd used the full 12 oz. of whipped topping. Also we used strawberry pie filling on top which was really good. Next time I make this I will probably cut up a few strawberries on top as well or maybe pipe some decorative whipped cream on top to make it prettier.",

My mom had recently given me a THREE pound container of cream cheese (gee thanks Costco) and I had no idea what to do with it. Not wanting to waste it I smothered a gob of it in cocktail sauce for an appetizer along with Wheat Thins and a cheese knife for spreading... very nice. I had never in my life made a dessert but looked on iine and found this Dream Cheese Pie recipe. Appeared simple enough to make and I still had plenty of Philadelphia Cream Cheese left so I gave it a shot. Wow... it was THEE hit and both pies were eaten while other bakery bought pies were just nibbbled on! Fantastic!! The only thing I changed was using strawberry filling instead of apple... can't go wrong with bananas ans strawberries!! Can't wait to make this again. Next time I'll place a few fresh strawberries on top as well (always abundant here in Southern California). Thanks Dee Dee Perez!:)",
