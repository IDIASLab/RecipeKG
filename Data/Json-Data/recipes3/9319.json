I used the already-prepared type and they were just okay. If you go this way don't bother trying to flatten with a rolling pin. I tore the croissants into pieces that fit in the bottom of my muffin pan then stacked another muffin pan on top of them (so the top pan was pushing down on the croissant pieces in the muffin wells. I piled a bunch of weight on top of the empty muffin pan so it would press the croissants flat. It worked pretty well although I had a bit of a hard time getting the finished products out of the pan. Overall these turned out a little bland. I like that they are light (no heavy cream or butter) but they need a little more seasoning. I did add diced red pepper and tomatoes so that helped.",
