I took the other reviewers' suggestions and made my favorite mac and cheese for the bottom.  The envelope mix/sloppy joe topping was horrible.  I had to doctor it up considerably to make it edible!  I think if I made this using my favorite mac and cheese plus my own sloppy joe recipe this might be better, but I advise against the envelope sloppy joe mix....",
