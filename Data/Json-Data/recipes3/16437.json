I used about 4-5 ounces of finely chopped fresh spinach uncooked a little more parmesan cheese than called for a little more tortellini and not nearly as much salad dressing (less than half of the 16 oz bottle). I used those little sweet 'grape' tomatoes and didn't cut them in half. It sat for a little bit (about an hour and a half) which I think was good. Let the tortellini soak up all the flavors. Thanks so much for this recipe - it's a keeper!",

Remove stems place in the bowl you will serve from cover and refrigerate until ready to serve or take somewhere.
