                "reviewBody": "Definitely, 5 stars for flavor and eye appeal.  This was delicious, and so satisfying to a casserole lover, like me!  Casseroles don't usually make the cut for Paleo followers, or Whole30 folks.  I have to say, I was very happy to find this recipe!  I did change it up a bit, but not much!  Here's what I did:  I used the ingredients for the meat mix, exactly as stated, and I started early in the day, before work.  I did change the method a bit, and I\u2019m glad I did, because there was no way I could have managed all the ingredients in my 12\u201d skillet.  I started the cauliflower in the steamer, and then I started browning the ground beef, adding all the spices and seasonings to the browned meat, then set the skillet aside, once it was done.  When the cauliflower was done, I put it in a strainer.  Then, I saut\u00e9ed all the vegetables in the cauliflower pot.  When they were soft, I was able to combine them with the meat and stir in the tomato paste.  I put the meat mixture in a prepared casserole, covered it and refrigerated, until dinner.   For the cauli mash, since I am avoiding cheese, I opted to omit the cream cheese.  I used ghee, and about \u00bd c. chicken broth to the mash so it would blend for me.  I refrigerated this in a separate dish.  When it was time to prepare dinner, I placed the meat mixture in the oven as it pre-heated, and let it cook through.  Then, I stirred about \u00bd the beaten egg into the cauli mash to bind it a little, and brushed egg on top, as directed.",
