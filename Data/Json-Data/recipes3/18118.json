The flavor was fantastic, and tasted just like a fresh lasagna, minus the cottage cheese. I'm new to cooking with the Instant Pot, and I love how even the prep is done in the pot prior to setting the pressure cooking feature. Definitely making this again but I can't think of a single thing I would want to add/change.  Thank you so much for sharing this!",
