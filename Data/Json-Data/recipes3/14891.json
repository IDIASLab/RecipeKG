(But then i'm from texas not buffalo. we like our food hot here.) perhaps the hot sauce you used just isn't up to the job. i mean you use different sauces for different things right? the sauce i put on my barbacoa is not the same sauce i put on my fajitas which in turn is not the same sauce i use on my wings. all I'm sayin is that this recipe deserves a chance. don't blow it off cause you used the wrong sauce....",

I used honey bbq sauce for the kids & my wings & used bottled wing sauce for hubby. Everyone loved them. This will become a regular on our menu as we really love good wings & haven't been able to get really good wings where we live now. Next time I will cut the wing sauce with butter for the boys & I.

I started out following the recipe exactly and did make it exactly however I used Frank's Red Hot \"Thick\" Sauce. However the butter separated from the sauce so I spooned out the butter and added more sauce so if you use the Frank's Thick sauce you can save a whole bunch of calories by not using any butter at all.

If you prepare the sauce on the stove whisk in a cornstarch slurry then add to the freshly fried wings you'll find yourself a much thicker sauce that will coat better. If it were me I'd have a higher sauce to butter ratio and add in a few spices too.",
