The flavor was very good but it was too dry and almost burnt from baking for so long. When I make it again I'll use a 2 quart casserole instead of a 3 quart. I'll also shorten the baking time from 1 hour to 1/2 an hour before adding the egg mixture and then continue to bake for only 15-20 minutes after adding the egg mixture. I'd also add another egg to the milk to make it thicker. This really does have great flavor and I definitely recommend it with the above changes.\n***Update: I made this recipe again with the changes I suggested. We all loved it! The bobotie was moist and delicious. I've passed the recipe along to family who also love it. I'd give it the recipe five stars with the changes.",

She loved it, as did the kids.  I served it with roast potatoes and minted peas, and now have my extended family hooked on it too.
