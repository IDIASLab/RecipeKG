I think what is missing here are some ingredients: 1. coriander powder 2. turmeric leaves (hard to get outside indonesia) 3. black peppercorn Also the authentic preparation is much longer. More like 6-8 hours. The minangkabau rendang (minangkabau is the region in sumatra where this dish come from) tends to be dry with all the liquid evaporated in the slow cooking. The meat is very dark almost black. To achieve this dark color put the rendang in oven at 220F for 1/2hour.",

I didn t find banana peppers so I used 3 red pepper and I used only 2 1/2 cans coconut milk I think it was enough because the sauce wasn t very thick. I put the half of the paste into a pan and added the coconut milk lemon grass and lime leaves boiled for about 20 min. then added the meat mixture with the other half of the paste. Overall this is a great dish my family was impressed thanks.",
