I made mine extra big using an ice cream scoop. I made sure the dough was nice and chilled before baking them and they spread out just the right amount. Since they were so large I had to increase the baking time to 13-14 minutes. They had a slight crust on the top and still super soft on the inside delicious with powdered sugar on top and a cup of tea! On a side note I tried this recipe with Pillsbury Cake mix (pudding in the mix version) and Betty Crocker Super Moist cake mix. I have to say that the Betty Crocker mix turns out a bit better the Pillsbury mix tends to come out a little doughy and flat.",

Only thing I changed was I tripled the vanilla.  1/4 tsp would never cut it in my family!  I wasn't sure if I should keep baking them longer after 13 minutes, but I took them out and they were perfect.   Just so you know what to look for: When you take them out of the oven the tops will be cracked.  The inside of the cracks will look moist and the outside will look dry. By they time they cool off, they're perfect.  I sprinkled them with extra sugar as they cooled and sent half the batch to the neighbor.  My hips will thank me in the morning.",

They tasted great but looked a little ugly since the cookie spread out and the jelly didn't stay in one place. So that was my practice batch that my husband and I ate (12 cookies in 12 hours...they're that good). The next batch I put in sweetened dried cranberries (like craisins) and dusted them with powdered sugar while they were still warm. Fabulous! My biggest tip if you're making these for gifts or company: Right after they come out of the oven LEAVE THE HOUSE. Then a few hours later when you're sure they're cool come back. Box them up or put them in the cookie tin and deliver them RIGHT AWAY. If you make them ahead a day or two there won't be any left for the person you made them for!",
