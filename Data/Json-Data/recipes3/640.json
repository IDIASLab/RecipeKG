I love that this uses the self rising flour rather than corn meal or bread crumbs.  I can flatten these patties out real thin and they still puff up nicely.  My Kids LOVE these.  I saut\u00e9ed a little onion and put in a little old bay seasoning and they were fantastic!  The Kids call them \u201cFish Cookies\u201d (they are 2 and 4years old).  Also, don\u2019t fret if you don\u2019t have self rising flour, make your own. It\u2019s a ratio; for each cup of all-purpose flour, add 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.",
