If you don't mind that the chicken won't be as brown (it's covered in sauce anyway) try covering the baking dish for moister chicken and you won't have the problem of a sauce that's too thick either.

I only had dried Rosemary and somewhere I read that you only use 1/3 of dried herbs called for in recipes if they call for fresh but I ended up adding the whole Tbs anyways.

It turned out great!  I used all white chicken strips and served it with steamed white rice.  All the extra sauce I used over the rice and placed the chicken on top!  One of the best meals I've had and made!!!  ",
