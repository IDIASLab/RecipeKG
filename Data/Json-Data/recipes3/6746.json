It is edible and all of us finished but left most of the sauce on our plates. I certainly don't want to dicourage others from using this recipe so I am giving it a three. For those who wish a Steak Diane ( named after the Roman \"hunter\" goddess) use filet mignon rubbed with garlic and crushed black peppercorns and fried quickly very quickly in butter; deglazethe pan juices with more butter finely chopped shallots heavy creme beef stock and if desired a dash of Worcestershire sauce and flambeed with brandy. The sauce is then poured over the steak prior to serving. I serve pommes frites and pea pods to accompany. Bon Appetite.",

Considering that we are competitive cooks and live in a part of the country that is known for its steaks that is quite a statement. One recommendation: the recipe calls for \"steak sauce\"....make sure it is one that you really like because the steak sauce provides a lot of flavor to this the cream sauce. I didn't use a steak \"sauce\" at all....I used my favorite steak marinade: Allegro Original Marinade. Also 1/2 cup of Dijon mustard seems like a lot so just eyeball it and slather it on to each side of the steak so that it coats each side evenly...like spreading mustard on a sandwich. I probably used between 1/4 to 1/2 to coat all four sides.",

The only thing I didn't like about it was the meat did start to get tough when you put it back into the pan with the mushrooms and sauce. It really only needs to be in there for about 30 seconds. I also had my butcher tenderize the steaks. There was a lot of the sauce left over next time we will have mash potatoes instead of wild rice. It is a keeper!",
