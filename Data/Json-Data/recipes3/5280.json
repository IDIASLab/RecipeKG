These weren't runny like grits I've had before (let me freely admit now that I've only rarely had grits; I have no idea how they're \"supposed to\" be).  I can see why the previous reviewer added eggs and I think that'd be a good addition, but it turned out fine without.  I served these with breakfast foods, but I think this would also be good for dinner with pork or chicken or even on the side with chili instead of corn bread.  I also think this recipe would be good with some hot peppers or hot sauce added to spice it up.  Thanks for the recipe, you've convinced this yankee to make grits again!",

I also used fat free milk and 50% low fat cheese I forgot the parmesan. The grits do have a firmer texture than they normally would and they were great where the outside and top got crispy. My 4 yo who loves cheese grits wouldn't eat them though because she didn't like the crunchy parts (where I thought they were best). My husband refuses to even try grits. He took a bit of these and said he would eat them again. However he still ate a baked potato for dinner rather than the grits. I will probably continue to look for another recipe though.",
