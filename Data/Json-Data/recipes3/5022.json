We didn't have teriyaki sauce so we used soy sauce and about a tablespoon of brown sugar instead.  Also, we used 1/8 cup of frozen onions instead of onion powder.  We will DEFINATELY do this one again!!  One extra tip: before inserting the pan into the oven, spray the sides of the pan with non-stick cooking spray.  This made cleaning up the pan a breeze.",

I was looking for a way to use some country style ribs that did not involve BBQ sauce, and thought this would suit, but I was disappointed.  The meat turned out incredibly tender, but the only taste that was apparent was the boatload of garlic! No flavor came through from broth or teriyaki. Won't be making this one again. (Thank goodness my husband wasn't home and didn't have to eat this - he would have pouted - LOL!)      [LATER THE SAME EVENING: OK, OK, I give.  I had neglected to taste the incredibly superior broth/au jus that cooked up, and was just tasting the meat!  Thicken that broth up and serve over smashed taters - to DIE for. The meat is MUCH better with the gravy poured over...!!! Nummies! }",

Substituted the teriyaki for Worcestershire and 1/8 cup of liquid smoke. I am one for seasoning my meat...here's what i use...season all cavenders onion powder and lemon pepper. It's up to you though. Watch out for the oinion soup mix though it has a bit of a salty taste to it.",
