From my experience, I usually need 3 egg whites from large eggs. I leave out the chocolate chips, refrigerate overnight, then knead in the chocolate chips while dough is cold. I usually roll by hand (which is super messy!!) into walnut sized balls and bake for ten minutes. I leave them on the sheet to cool for a few minutes to allow them to firm up then transfer to a cooling rack. Don't skimp on the chocolate chips, they help make them gooey on the inside!!",

I placed it in the fridge for an hour or so, hoping it would firm up. Mixed in the chocolate chips at this point. I saw all of the comments about cookies sticking on the sheets, and I can relate. I used parchment paper and sprayed that. I used teaspoon to measure out the amounts. They started to spread out a little. Baked 10 min and let sit 5 min before removing. They really spread out more and touched. They were very difficult to remove. Came out very thin, crispy, good flavor but burnt on bottom! I think I'll look for another such recipe. I'm glad I only made half the recipe. Hoping to give to someone but had to toss out. Sorry!",
