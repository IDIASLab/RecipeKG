This review will be a little long but it is simply my observations since I made it exactly as called for.  First I highly recommend you watch a video on how to cut the chicken, it is easy, do not be intimidated by this.  The reduced cook time make the small effort so worth it!!!  Second, you can use metal skewers to keep the shape,  cross them diagonally through the breast meat and then into the thigh meat. I looked for a smaller bird but 4.5 lbs is the smallest I could find and it only to 1hr and 10 min to cook!  I used a digital Thermometer and it was simple.  The last bit is that I used all the veggies called for, but only half fit in the bottom of the broiler pan so I put the rest on a sheet pan and roasted them.  The veggies from the sheet pan were so nice and crisp, the veggies from the broiler pan were so moist from the chicken juices.  I love veggies, so both ways worked for me!  I served it with Wild Rice as well which was a nice add.  Thanks so much for the terrific recipe!",

The vegetables were mouthwatering, those on the edges were crispy while the ones under the chicken were softer both soaking up all the flavor & juices of the chicken. As Howard stated in his review I would recommend watching Chef John how to on how to cut the chicken. I did to familiarize myself. My chicken was 8 pounds and cooked in about an hour and a half. I'm definitely making this recipe again and I'm going to season the chicken with thyme, garlic & rosemary. Thank you Diane for such a great recipe.",

Of course, it does take at least an hour to roast a chicken, so it's probably not going to make the nightly rotation, but the WEEKEND is another story!  The chicken was so tasty and tender, with a crispy skin, as promised.  Be sure to test with a meat thermometer.  Mine needed additional cooking time, even after bringing the bird to room temp.  I loved the roasted potatoes that were on the bottom of the dish, because they caramelized deeply, and I was very stingy with them, lol!  DH went back for seconds on the veggies, and I must admit, so did I.  I served it tonight with a garden salad and some hot, crusty bread, and I know I will serve it again!  My only changes to the recipe were to add some salt and pepper to the veggies, and I used Papa's Seasoning Salt, an AR recipe, on the chicken.  Thank you, Diana!",

I also added brussel sprouts and cut them in half. I used a grinder with salt-pepper-garlic and no sodium Mrs. Dash. I also added about 1/4 cup of Vegetable broth at the bottom before the vegetables to help add flavor and to baste the chicken as it was roasting. Yummy! This was so good and tasty. The vegetables were great, soft but not mushy because I sliced them thick. This recipe is a winner in my house!",
