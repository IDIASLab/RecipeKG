Saw that some on here have mentioned that this recipes is full of carbs. It does have lots of carbs, but they are healthy ones. This recipe contains healthy, complex carbohydrates like beans and avocados, which we all need to have healthy, balanced diets and that provide energy; we should avoid simple carbs, like pretzels, white bread, donuts, lots of types of candies, pies, etc. are the types that turn to pure sugar once eaten and cause weight gain. It is never healthy to completely avoid ALL carbs, just the ones that cause weight gain or can be unhealthful for those with various diseases like diabetes. It is never healthy to avoid any one food group; just make sure you are eating the right type.",
