                "reviewBody": "edited: This is a nice, easy dish to prepare. The chops were incredibly moist & tender & the sauce was pleasant. Browning the chops in butter was an excellent way to boost flavor, but to ensure they were well-done, I put the oven higher to 350 so they could finish there while the sauce was prepared; they were perfect. I omitted the brandy. The mushroom & apple flavors were weak. Overall, the sauce was less flavored than I had expected, the mushrooms & apple flavors were obscured.  A calvados instead of any old brandy might help boost the apple flavor. I also used unsalted butter, & a generous pinch of kosher salt helped boost the flavor. Some fresh parsley would probably be a good addition. I made this again, curdling problem not repeated. It still needs a strong boost of apple flavor, though. I increased the cider and reduced it to about a quarter. I made up the difference in the liquid by adding more cider; I reduced it again to about half per the original recipe. I didn't want to use something heavy & risk diluting the apple flavor, so I warmed some whole milk in the microwave instead of cream (about 1/8 cup, maybe a little more, but under 1/4 cup) & whisked it in slowly. Next time, I'll try adding some calvados & see what that gets me.",
