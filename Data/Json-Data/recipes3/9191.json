If you have ghee (clarified butter) use it instead of the half-stick of butter called for. I have a Ninja machine so I just stemmed and quartered the tomatoes trimmed and chopped the zucchini peeled and chopped the onion and garlic. I like a bit of \"heat \" soI used 3 Jalape\u00f1o chilies stems removed but seeds included instead of the bell pepper. I didn't have any coconut butter on hand so I substituted coconut milk for the milk and coconut butter. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the 't.' You may want more salt when the soup is done. The Ninja made a beautiful pur\u00e9e and the cream is a glorious finish. Oh I sprinkled a bit of chopped cilantro on as a garnish. All of us at table were mightily impressed. This far exceeded what I'd expected.",

I am not super experienced with \"tumeric or curry\" and they are a strong \"NATURAL DYE.\" I got some on the counter and had to work hard to get the yellow orange spots off while this soup cooked. I just blended this in my Vitamix machine which can cook soup. However it turned my pretty clear blender and turned it a green tint. I am currently soaking it now to see if I can get it out. I wouldn't care if it was an al-cheapo blender but this thing cost me 500.00 dollars!! The soup itself has an orange/yellow color also. I thought it had an Indian flavor if anything. I wasn't sure what to throw in at the end as it just needs something besides the liquid even if it is slightly thick in my opinion. I added chopped cilantro and some ff half and half as suggested. Just not worth the afterwards clean-up!",
