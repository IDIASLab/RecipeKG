Pair it with some sharp Cheddar on a cheese plate, or slather it onto cheesy biscuits (see footnote). Other approved uses include spreading between the layers of a spice cake, filling seasonably appropriate thumbprint cookies, or even as a condiment for pork chops.",

This Apple Butter is by far the best I've ever had and making it is a breeze. If there were more than 5* to rate it, I'd have them all lined up and knocked each star down when I tagged it! ?? This would be AWESOME as Christmas gifts, a Birthday treat for a lover of this...like me! Thanks for sharing Chef. I can't wait to try more of your recipes. Y'all do yourself a favor, make it and make enough (in my case the freezer) be it canning or freezing.  Don't forget the gift idea; your friends will be dropping hints for bigger jars especially those who can't cook! Enjoy! IT ROCKS!!",
