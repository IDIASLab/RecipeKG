Use more veggies chopped broccoli zucchini squash black olives and pretty much a little of any of your favorite veggies.

I used a small can of tomato sauce and the sliced tomatoes also. Try it again and see if you don't get better results!",

I used 2 cans of diced Italian tomatoes without draining and 3 whole eggs. It turned out great! I don't know if I would have even had trouble anyway. I also poured some store bought red sauce on the plate and served the wedge on top. It made for a pretty presentation. I didn't have any ricotta cheese on hand so I substituted fat free cottage cheese and it worked great. The best thing about this recipe is the ability to throw in whatever you have on hand. I added some onions and garlic. Next time I plan to try adding artichoke hearts spinach and black olives!",

Cook the spaghetti rinse with cold water add beaten eggs to cooled spaghetti (otherwise you'll get egg chunks in your cake) mix in other jar of sauce. Layer half of spaghetti mix pressing slightly. Next layer the meat mix. Then layer the rest of the spaghetti and top with mozzarella. I cooked mine for the time allowed in the recipe with a cookie sheet underneath to keep any seeping off my oven.
