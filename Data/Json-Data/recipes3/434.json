Second, I hate the synthetic taste of Cool Whip, so I use real whipped cream, or at least Reddi Whip. Finally (and I know this is a matter of opinion) I prefer it after 24 hours in the fridge, when the Oreos have gotten softer and more cake-like. My kids, however, prefer them same-day crunchy. I had no trouble covering the bottom of a 9x13 pan with the cookies, but I think it helps to grind them finer than the recipe suggests.",

I used one box of pudding and one and a half blocks of cream cheese ( 12 oz total) and it wasn't tangy at all. I would go with the full two next time. I also would double the pudding amount ( 2 boxes and four cups of milk). I had plenty of cookies to cover the 9x13 inch pan with reserving one cup for on top. I crushed the cookies in a ziplock bag- they were piecy and gave a great texture to the dish. Mine was definitely firm enough to be cut into squares and held it's shape wonderfully, so not sure why some people said it was runny. I made it with chocolate pudding but may try vanilla with golden oreos next time. I plan to make this again and again! Thanks :)",

Thank goodness I did because even though I love cream cheese, I couldn't imagine using two packages in this recipe. I could see how some people found the filling to be extremely tangy. Don't understand why the photo (which I realize was probably not taken by the submitter) was round when the directions clearly stated using a 9X13 inch pan. Also, from the photo, there are four alternate layers of black and white. I kept reading the directions to see if I was missing something. Nonetheless, the cake was quick and easy to put together and a hit with hubby, the kids and their boyfriends. Thanks so much Pam!",

To make the whipped cream use 3 cups of whipping cream (this will make about 6 cups of whipped cream corresponding to 16 oz cool whip) with a tsp of vanilla and a few tsp of sugar mixed in. Also I used the full amount of cream cheese listed in the recipe. I definitely recommend using the entire 2 pkgs of cream cheese. It's not tangy at all and I think the recipe would be lacking without the cream cheese. I used vanilla pudding but I'm sure chocolate would also taste good. Highly recommend this dessert even though it's not healthy!",

Added vanilla extract to cream cheese picture. Used chocolate pudding but make the pudding as if you are using it for a pudding pie cut back on the milk. It will hold together better. I processed the cookies a bit more almost to crumbs. I assembled the layers in a pie pan as follows: Cookie/butter mixture on the bottom followed by cream cheese mixture followed by more cookie crumbs and I added a little milk to soften the cookies. On top of that I added chocolate pudding and finished with cool whip chocolate cookies. It was great it stayed together and cut perfectly.",
