Didn't have time to strain cucumbers for 4 hours so after slicing them I sprinkled them with salt instead of adding it to the dressing and set the colander in the sink. Them tamped them dry before adding to dressing. Cucumbers drained well in 1/2 hour. Used prestrained Greek yogurt and omitted sour cream. Delicious and ready in 1 1/2 hours.",

I put in only 1 tsp and even with the salt reduced this much the result actually tasted of salt which dulled the brightness that I associate with cucumber salad. Next time I'll cut that in half. I also added about a half of a mild medium white onion sliced very thin. With these changes I'll definitely make this my go-to cucumber salad!",
