Only put a little bit of water in the pan put in half of the veggies drizzled on some olive oil sprinkled with seasonings but added some dry beef bouillon granules. Then added the other half of veggies olive oil seasonings and bouillon. To keep the sweet potates from getting done before the white potatoes I chunked them in larger pieces. I also used the AR calculation button to reduce this to 4 servings and baked in our toaster oven. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",
