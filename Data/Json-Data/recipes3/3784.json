It's not for wimpy palates though: the flavours are robust! I made 1 1/2 times the amount of cheese mixture and used a little more of the tomato to yield two bowls. A note to people who are doubtful about the sundried tomatoe: even though ordinary tomato paste is indeed cheaper the flavour can in no way compared to sundried tomato paste or pate. Dry-packed (ie. in a packet not in a jar in oil) dried tomatoes are CHEAP and you're far better off using those. Simply place them in a bowl cover with boiling water allow to soak until soft and swollen then drain and wizz in the food processor with good olive oil oregano garlic and salt and pepper and a few olives and/or capers if you like. Extremely delicious inexpensive and better than anything you could buy - particularly ordinary tomato paste!",

I think I might make my next version without them altogether because they are expensive and their taste is always overpowered by the garlic anyway.
