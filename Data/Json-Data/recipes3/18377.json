It sounds a little strange but if you love dill pickles on your cheeseburger, this recipe is a must! I had it at a restaurant once and fell in love, and I've been perfecting it ever since. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and/or more pickles - I like more chopped pickles in mine, personally.",

Between the ground beef and all of the cheese, this is an expensive soup and I couldn't bring myself to eat the leftovers. What I will say is that it does taste like a cheeseburger so if you love cheeseburgers, give it a try and maybe it will go over better with you.",
