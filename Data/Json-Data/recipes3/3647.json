I made some initial changes, which perfected the recipe for us and which I've kept all these years: 1) I omit the lemon juice altogether 2) I add about 1/4 cup chopped parsley which adds beautiful color, scent and a slight lemony flavor that makes up for the missing lemon juice and 3) I always saute shrimp or chicken in the pan with garlic and olive oil FIRST, then spoon it onto a dish and set aside, before using the same pan to make the sauce. This will add a lot of flavor to the sauce. Then after the sauce is made, add back the shrimp/chicken along with cooked pasta, mix and then dish up and serve. GREAT!",

(8 D) I tried your recipe and my friends and I were extremely pleased with the results. Not too difficult; not too time consuming. The cream came out very rich and flavorful and I believe that by estimating the amounts of wine garlic and lemon juice I was able to achieve a wonderful balance. (I try to use recipes as a foundation for creation rather than direct instruction - this allows me to experience how different amounts of ingredients will effect the end result and to adjust for different tastes geographically...) Thank you for providing a wonderful foundation for a memorable dinner with my closest friends.",
