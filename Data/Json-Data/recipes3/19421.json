I found that with about a quarter of a cup less flour it worked great and was much easier, and faster in a cookie press. I decorated with M&M's and Rosebuds which bake with a wonderful toasted chocolate taste. This is my third year making them and will make this recipe for years to come. Everyone in my family has requested the recipe, and asked that I bring it every year for Xmas. Merry Christmas everyone :o)",

Like I said after 2 hours of working with the dough in SMALL batches and finally getting it to cut out the taste was awesome. Totally not worth the hassle though. I'll use a different recipe next time because there's other just as tasty but easier to make shortbread cookies out there.",
