I used Marsala wine (what I had open--I don't like having more than one bottle of wine in the fridge at any given time) and it worked well. I also used black eyed peas instead of navy beans because the black eyed peas were handy at the time. I lvoed this and served with bread (for myself) and rice (for hubs) plus green beans. I really liked it with the green beans that accidently mixed in this on my plate so I think I'd add green beans or carrots or both next time--I liked the veggies with all those meat and beans. Hubs thought it was \"all right\" but I definitely enjoyed this and think you could take down the meat a notch if you aren't in the mood for that much. thanks for the recipe!",
