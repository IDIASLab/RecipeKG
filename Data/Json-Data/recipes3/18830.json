Never heard of adding the beans, but imagine they would be ok.  the YELLOW split peas are the key (never ever use green ones), and they should be 'soaked' overnight (put in a large bowl and cover with cold water - they will expand!)  put the soaked peas (water too) in the hot broth & puree with an immersion blender if you have one - then add the onion, garlic, S&P, ham & finely chopped carrots.  Bring to a boil and simmer for about an hour or so..... Yum!!! (PS: you can always buy a ham hock or two to make this with if you don't have a ham.) This 'thickens up' considerably when cool but you don't need to add water to it when reheating.  This soup freezes well!!",
