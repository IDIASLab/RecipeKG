I've steamed asparagus, roasted it in the oven, and even nuked it...all good, but doing it this way just made it different -- similar to roasting, rich in color, flavor, and almost caramelized. Definitely more depth of flavor than just steaming. This method will be a repeat.",

I shall use a large skillet like recommended as the med. one I used was not large enough for the asparagus spears to touch the bottom of pan and thus my garlic and shallots burned a bit. I ended up cutting the spears in half while still cooking in pan but the onion/shallots had already burned! nonetheless it was still a tasty side! loved it and will cook it many times in the future.Oh I love garlic so I added a couple more cloves!",
