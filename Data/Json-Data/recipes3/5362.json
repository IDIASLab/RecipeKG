I made the following changes to make it gluten-free: I used 1 cup of millet flour then 1/2 cup each of the following: rice flour white bean or fava bean flour and amaranth or quinoa flour. Feel free to make other substitutions for these flours if you have other favorites. I also used soy milk instead of buttermilk adding 1 Tbsp. of vinegar to the soy milk and letting it sit for five minutes. Great recipe--everyone loves it! The honey makes it irresistable to my sweet tooth.",

I didn't have quite all the ingredients so following other reviewer's suggestions I left out the egg and I mashed up an overripe pear to replace most of the oil. It was moist and tender but still held together nicely. Because of the whole wheat flour I was very surprised how much this muffin rose and how light it was. It's not a sweet muffin but it's great with honey butter very nutritious and the way I made it completely guilt free. This is totally a keeper. EDIT: Having made these about a dozen times I thought I'd mention a good variation we found - mashed pear as listed above with 1 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of grated nutmeg. Just gives it a little depth and makes the house smell good.",

I had already eaten breakfast this morning but after sampling one I suddenky found myself polishing off another! They were but 15 seconds out of the oven and elevated me to a state of Nirvana. The millet adds a pleasant crunch and though I was afraid that the flavor would be bland and lacking it was absolutely perfect. I might experiment around with substituting applesauce for the oil to reduce fat but if it changes the texture and flavor too badly I think that I can cope with the slight guilt of indulging in such a yummy treat.
