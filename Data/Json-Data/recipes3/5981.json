I used white basmati rice instead of the rice mix. I served with a little grated Colby-Jack melted on top. Thanks so much for this recipe, I'd give it 10 stars if I could! ",

Here in Florida yellow rice is almost a staple but if you can't find it just mix some saffron or saffron seasoning to the dry rice -- there is your yellow rice. I always have to thank the reviewers. Based on their suggestions I seasoned the chicken with Beau Monde salt and pepper and garlic and cut the chicken into pieces after browning and didn't dredge the chicken in flour. I omitted the cayenne; we like spice but it doesn't like us. I also added cumin and a small amount of curry powder. I used a trinity mix from Publix (onion green peppers and celery) instead of just chopped onions. I think they call that the \"holy trinity\" in Louisiana cooking. Wonderful! I listed it as a favorite in my database.",
