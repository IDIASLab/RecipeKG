I omit the potatoes & substitute a hashbrown crust on the bottom. I also add broccoli & mushrooms & any other veggies on hand. I did need to cook this for almost an hour & to finish it off I broiled it for a couple of minutes but I also used more eggs. Go crazy & experiment with additional ingredients! Add some dill weed or fresh rosemary for added flavor.",

This is a pretty basic omelet - nothing unusual here - but the sliced tomato which I placed on the omelet just before baking rather than mixing it in really dressed this up. Lots of red and green going on so this would be a nice choice for a festive Chriistmas breakfast. Just salt and pepper is fine but this would benefit from some seasoning to boost the flavor - I added fresh minced garlic and fresh chives. I made a half recipe and baked it in a shallow ceramic baker about 30 minutes.",
