The only problem with them was that they leaked while baking which is probably my fault becuase I used less feta cheese ( 8 oz)than the recipe called for. I did make them ahead and froze them on a cookie sheet. I may try it with some fresh mint next time instead of the parsley. My brother likes them with some sugar or honey on top so good! A little time consuming but very much worth it with all the compliments you will receive =)",

The second time I made these I was in a bit of a rush and put more of the filling in than I should've. The first pan all exploded all over leaving me with a bunch of triangular phyllo packets with what looked like egg salad all over them. Also you can't really make these ahead of time or the phyllo will dry out but you also don't want to ignore your guests while you're carefully folding phyllo packets in the kitchen! They're not great cold so I'm sort of at a loss as to how to successfully make these for guests. They tasted good warm and I upped the feta bit to make the filling thicker and easier to handle and to give more flavor to it. Not sure that I'll make these again.",
