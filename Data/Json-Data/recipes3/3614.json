I didn't have any flour so I used Chicken frying mix (which is mostly flour base with seasonings). And I also added McCormick s Chicken seasoning while it was simmering. This combo adds flavor and complements the chicken very well. I didn't have to add any salt. My family enjoyed! Thanks for sharing.",

Tip: Remember to adjust your sauce accordingly when adding more pasta &/or vegetables to recipe -- I didn't and ended up short on sauce -- better to err on the side of too much in my book; ) Bon Appetite friends!",
