We have had a similar recipe in our family for years with the following changes:  increase the butter by adding 1/2 cup of melted butter to the potato mixture and 1/4 cup melted butter mixed with the cornflake topping; 1 can of cream of mushroom soup (instead of chicken); 8 oz cheese; one small diced onion (instead of flakes) and 2 cups of crushed cornflakes for topping.  The rest is the same although I usually bake it closer to an hour.  I know the fat content just more than quadrupled but it's soooooo good.",
