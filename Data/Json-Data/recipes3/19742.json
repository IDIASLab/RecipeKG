I split the 1 roll of sausage that I had between both. I also added a lb of bacon and split that between both of them. I put one in the freezer for a quick tv dinner. They were both delicious. I did as other reviewers suggested (30 min uncovered and 30 minutes covered). I did broil for 5 minutes afterwards to make the bacon crispy. I let the frozen dinner thaw for about an hour before baking it. I have to say this was a really easy recipe. My DH had no problem cooking the tv dinner either. Thanks for the recipe.",
