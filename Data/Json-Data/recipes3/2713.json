                "reviewBody": "EXCELLENT!  I recommend going on ebay and buying the \"Great American Steakhouse Onion Machine\".  Its really cheap and makes it soooo easy to make the blooms.  It works great!  Otherwise if doing by hand, here is some major tips.  First, a big \"no-no\" is to cut both ends of the onion off.  DO NOT cut the root end.  Just cut the top.  The root holds it all together, so when you cut your petals they will not fall apart.  Also when coring it, just core it about 90% of the way down, leaving the root intact.  This is easiest with a corer utensil.  When you are done, put it bloom-side down into a bowl of ice water for an hour.  This really helps it to hold up and easier to work with.  Now you are ready to bread and fry your bloom.  When frying I recommend to put it in root side down first.  Then half way thru cooking time flip it over, so that the bloom is on the bottom, and push down on the root.  The pushing down on it will help to open the petals up. When it is done you can go and cut the rest of the core and the root out of the middle.  You will have a perfect blooming onion everytime!  Sorry so long, but I really wanted to help some people that are scared of making them.  My first blooming onion just didnt work and I never wanted to make one again, until I did these steps and it turned out perfect.  This recipe is great.  The sauce is soo yummy!  I slightly warm the sauce before serving, bc it just tastes so much better than serving it cold.  It tastes just like the restaurants",

                "reviewBody": "I've combined a lot of the wisdom from other reviewers and added some of my own.  Firstly, I think it's important to do this in a LARGE fryer.  I use the turkey fryer at 375 F. The onion is large so it will drop the oil temp immediately upon dipping it into a small fryer, and if the oil temp drops too much, you will have a soggy, greasy onion instead of a crispy one. I cut the onion and dump it in upside down into ice water for 30 min. to spread the petals.  I also double the dry ingredients to ensure  full coating of the onion.  The first time the dry ingredient amount didn't suffice.  I leave the core intact to keep the onion from falling apart, and then I cut it out after I fry it. At 375 F, it takes about 6 minutes (with core intact) to fry properly.  Keep watching it!  It will overcook pretty quickly and there is a danger of undercooking it.  The middle takes longer to cook than the outside petals, so when you remove it, check the inner petals for doneness.  Towards the latter end of frying, I flip it upside down and push down on it to let the buoyancy of the oil spread out the petals. Of course, the sauce can be adjusted to taste.  I increase the horseradish sauce to 3-4 T, quadruple the oregano, increase the salt to taste, and of course the cayenne pepper, because I like it spicy.",

It was hard to get the batter inbetween the layers but even the ones at the restaurant aren't always that perfect:) The sauce was terrific.

I used to work in a popular restaraunt and this is how we made ours. People loved it! They requested it for their onion rings, onion petals, and even a dip for their shrimp, and as a salad dressing. Last night I tried the dipping sauce in this recipe. Making it exactly as written, it was way too much mayo for my familys taste. I threw that batch out and started over cutting the mayo in half and we all enjoyed it. In the past I have made a dip very similar to this using sour cream instead of mayo and it was very good also.",

Then, there's no room left for a meal!  Great for football season. Go Pats!  I bought this little device from one of those magazines of wierd home things that come in the mail.  I think that's the reason mine come out so well.  It's idiot proof.  It has slots that tell you where to slice, a corer, and it stops the knife before you get to the bottom of the onion.  If you like the bloom, look into it.  Thanks for sharing.",
