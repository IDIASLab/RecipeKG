I also added a couple of tablespoons of peach schnapps to make sure it had a good peachy flavor. We were taking this to a friend's house but it didn't quite make it. We each tried a little bite and ended up eating half of the cake. I had to cube the rest since I couldn't exactly bring a half eaten cake. We had it with ice cream and some kind of peach sauce would have been nice over the ice cream. We all finished off the bowl of cubed cake that night. It was great plain to snack on but could also be fancied up with whipped cream a peach sauce or ice cream and sliced peaches.",

It was a nice little experiment to see what could be created with just two ingredients but it was nothing special and not something I'm likely to make again. Even with a delicate peach flavor I felt it needed something so I topped it with a strawberry rhubarb sauce I had made from my garden last summer and fresh whipped cream. Thanks for sharing the recipe - it definitely was quick easy and fun to make!",

I spread the batter in a 9x10x2 ungreased baking pan (9x13x2 would work too!) and baked at a slightly higher temp (I have a gas oven) - until it was pretty brown on top and a knife came out clean. It was not soggy at all! It was great - hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream on the side!!!! I had mine with powdered sugar sprinkled on top (also hot out of the oven!). Great for a quickie Movie night dessert/treat!!! Best to eat it the night it is made - not suited to be \"leftovers.\"",

Last Sunday for Easter (my husband loved it and got upset when I took the leftovers to work on Monday!) and today for a baby shower. I made it into cupcakes for the baby shower. Topped it with whipped cream and they were a big hit. Watch them in the oven because they will scorch easily in cupcake form. I can see myself making this again and again. I may try other types of fruit too. Manderin oranges pineapple etc....Who would have thought...Thanks! 7/10/04 Syill making this cake and still loving it! For a nice presentaion lay a piece on a plate top with a spoon of whipped cream and slice of fresh peach. People will love it.",
