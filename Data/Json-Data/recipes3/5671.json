                "reviewBody": "Have been using Allrecipes since the start and rarely post anything but THIS WAS REALLY GOOD. And so much easier than I thought biscuits had to be (no flour all over the counter etc.). The recipe came together in about 5 mintues. Used beef dripping (lard) as I had it. Bearing in mind the instructions I really tried to make sure I didn't \"overwork\" the dough/batter and did leave it slight sticky. Just squeezed up 9 larger biscuits patted into rough rounds and left them to the oven. They were barely gold on top when the bottoms were brown -- so watch out they could get away from you. But I found the recipe's timing to be accurate. I put these with some stew I pulled out of the freezer but would also be great for breakfast as they're so fast. The texture is not so much flaky but very very light and fluffy. Have since made this on a holiday visit with friends -- found out we didn't have any milk so substituted some watered down sour cream and that worked brilliantly. This is so handy it'll have to be a keeper... one of my \"desert island recipes.\"",

This one is simple requires no sifting and comes out with scrumptous biscuits that do great in the oven even after they've been frozen. I replaced the shortening with lighly salted butter but otherwise I followed the recipe. I know I lack experience in the hand forming technique and I'm sure I kneaded them more then the recipe called for (I like to use up all my leftover flour or scraps into the dough which requires more kneading) but they still turned out wonderfully! They're done when you get a lightly golden hue on the tops about 10 min in my oven. A light flakey crust on top and soft on the inside. To freeze I simply put the individual uncooked biscuits in a freezer safe container or freezer ziplock with some syran wrap so they don't stick together took them out when I needed them allowed them to come to room temp (really important) put them on a baking pan with non stick spray and cooked like normal in the oven according to recipe. When I make this again I might try cutting the butter back to 1/3 c and see what that does to the recipe. Happy baking!",
