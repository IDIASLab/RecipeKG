Here are my changes: First I chopped the sausage and cooked it in a skillet, reserving the grease in a measuring cup.  I then cooked the chopped peppers, onions, and celery in the same pan until soft, the placed in a separate bowl.  Next I cooked bacon to render the fat and poured the fat into the measuring cup until it reached 1/2.  After removing the bacon, I poured back into the skillet the grease and flour and cooked to make roux for 20 minutes.  While that was cooking, I cooked 8 chicken thighs in a stock pot with one small can of chicken broth.  I removed the thighs when done, then cut them into pieces and put with the sausage and vegie mixture.  When the roux was ready, I poured the chicken broth into the roux and stirred, then added the meat and vegie mixture.  I added Zateran's creole seasoning to taste.  I did not have the okra, so I added one can of red beans and a bit of corn for color.  Stir well and serve!",

I now have to use fresh onion celery & bell pepper because I cannot find it frozen here in Dallas. Just work with what you have make sure to not burn the roux and it should all be good! Enjoy!",

Doesn't really take very long (as gumbo goes) so thats a plus. my wife is from the south (US)and said it was as good as any she had ever had. Maybe she was just being nice but still 5 stars man.",

I PERSONALLY would NEVER make gumbo with anything other than andoullie sausage and if you want to serve some really authentic gumbo try serving over potato salad instead of rice. The tomato's are strictly for a creole style gumbo and NOT a cajun gumbo so I never use them either. Have fun and experiment with things. It's hard to mess up gumbo when you have a great roux.",

Adding the vegetables to the roux without any liquid did not make sense to me. It was too dry so I added a can of chicken broth and let it simmer. However I don't know why everything could not just be dumped into the pot and let simmer together. Good flavor. Next time I will use bacon grease instead of oil for more flavor and certainly fresh vegetables when in season. Thanks for sharing!",
