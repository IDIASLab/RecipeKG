I just added more (actually a lot) hot sauce and additional horseradish sauce to achieve that perfect sweet-spicy flavor. We all have different taste preferences and I think this is one of those recipes where you just need to adapt to your liking. There are few ingredients so it isn t rocket science to tweak this recipe. This would be an excellent sidekick to coconut shrimp but today I partnered it with Deep-Fried Prawns and Rice Croquettes another recipe on the AR site. lwilliams001 thanks for sharing your recipe it s versatile simple and simply good.",
