I tried it with frozen berries and made them ahead but when I left the two together overnight I got a little bit of a stomach ache when I ate it. I don't know why but when I make and eat it right away I felt fine. It's easy to make and a perfect replacement for ice cream or other movie time snacks. Also perfect because you can't eat it super fast while the berries are frozen. Well at least I couldn't. Thanks for the recipe!",

I was great with the frozen fruit but did get quite a bit of liquid in the bottom as the fruit defrosted.",
