Use a no salt added chicken broth or make your own chicken broth (it's easy to do so). That will cut the salt content and there will still be lots of flavor. Use other seasonings instead of salt to spice it up a bit. (Sage rosemary thyme garlic onion powder (not onion salt). It's easy to turn a salty recipe into something less salty. Good recipe just needs tweaking to individual tastes. Don't be afraid to experiment with this one.",

My family and guests commented numerous times throughout the meal how wonderful it tasted and one guest just called again when she got home to say how good dinner was! As many other reviewers said make 3 times the sauce add MULTIPLE TIMES FRESH PRESSED GARLIC (you can NEVER have too much fresh garlic) add some crushed rosemary and sage to your chicken flour (you need more of that than the recipe calls for too) DON't overcook your juliened vegetables or chicken (do veggies in the last 7 minutes of simmering the chicken) and skip the salt in the flour part of recipe because cooking sherry has enough salt. Try oven baked potatoes w/ Lipton onion soup crushed garlic pepper and parsley as a side dish. Serve chardonnay for dinner. Many compliments will ensue I promise.",

I might actually triple it next time because I let the chicken simmer for longer than the recipe stated (probably 30-40 min) and it soaked up the sauce. The chicken was fantastic but next time I'll use more sherry and chicken broth. I served this over rice and it was fabulous.:) thank you.",

I find if you slice the breasts thin and pound to a 1/4 inch you can quickly saute them in butter and olive oil remove them to a warm platter make the sauce and return the chicken to the pan for a brief simmer to merge the flavors. I did not use flour to coat the chicken but preferred to use a mixture of butter and olive oil to brown. The butter gives an added bit of richness to the sauce. I also sauteed the zuchinni and carrots in butter and olive oil and added a splash of lemon juice and sherry at the end to enhance the flaors. I served on a platter with the vegetables surrounding the chicken and sauce spooned over the dish. Served with rice. Thank you for this delicious recipe.",
