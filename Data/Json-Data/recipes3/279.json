It is easier to whip than pasteurized or pasteurized & homogenized.  Try to make sure the cream is very cold when you start to whip it, and keep it as cold as possible while whipping it.  When it is too warm it churns (like making butter) instead of whips.  Good luck.",

It is probably the best sugar free dessert I have ever made.. here's what I did: I used sugar free instant pudding and instead of conf sugar I used sucralose granular (Splenda) Since the cream cheese and splenda was a little \"thick\" w/o conf sugar consistancy I added some extra whipped cream to the mixture. I also had to use a little extra flour in the crust to get the right consistancy and I did not have walnuts so used pecans instead. It was DELICIOUS! If you like to try to lighten up desserts as we do try this modified version and I am sure you will love it!",
