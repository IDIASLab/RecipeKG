Here are the changes I made: used about 2 tbsp of margarine instead of 1/2 cup of butter (because I cannot bring myself to do that to my family) and sprayed the glass baking dish with PAM; made my own cornmeal mix (1cup each of cornmeal and flour and 1 tbsp baking powder with 1 tsp salt makes about 300 g, so I mixed this up and used only about 240g which equals 8.5 oz as the recipe had asked for); and finally I substituted egg substitue for the four eggs to make it lighter. It was done in about 20-25 minutes (on account of the glass dish I think...took less than the predicted 30 minutes). It is really nice. YOu have to like onions though because the flavour is very dominant....might try green onions next time. Also if you like something like bacon or ham pieces would probably go really well. \r\nThank you very much for the recipe...Really easy and with my modifications ( I think) healthy enough for me to make it again.\r\n",

As it was I can still see its potential.;o) I have never heard of self-rising cornmeal mix so I was thankful to read instructions on how to make it in one of the previous reviews! (1 c. cornmeal 1 c. flour 1 T. baking powder 1 t. salt). Silly me forgot to measure 8.5 oz of this mix - I ended up with quite dry bread! Also I was out of margarine so I substituted 2 T. of oil for the margarine since I was afraid to overdo it!.... likely the margarine would've worked better. I used a 9\" cake pan and it didn't cook in the center very well - it was too thick I guess! Who knew there was such a size as 11x7 for a pan?! Oh well! Thanks for a good recipe I will definitely try this one again soon with all the right ingredients and pans!:oD",
