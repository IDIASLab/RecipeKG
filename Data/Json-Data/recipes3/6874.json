I use basil and oregano in mine, but feel free to use your favorite herbs and spices, this recipe is very forgiving. Using fresh rosemary in the goat cheese filling will give the burgers a real Greek flavor. Serve the burgers on hamburger buns or pita bread with tzatziki sauce, or on their own with a Greek salad.",

Cut back a lil bit on the lamb and add some beef... lamb can be really greasy and the beef can soak up some of the great making it easier to eat.

Oh and you don't want to put ketchup/mustard on this burger so to mix it up spread some hummus onto the bread and add a little feta cheese... really bomb.",
