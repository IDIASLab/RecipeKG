Also, too much spinach I do not like, so I altered a few things from others I have made and found one I just love! It is not too spinach-y. I love the crunch from the jicama and red bell pepper. Took this to a party and it was a hit! I served in round sourdough bread bowl with variety of bread, crackers, and veggies. Enjoy!",

I went to the store and found 1! very small jicama I snagged it and put it in the FP. Perfect texture I wasn't sure if the jicama would get soggy as it sat Nope Still plenty of Crunch! I also added a handful of chopped cilantro to add a bit of pizazz and it was Perfect! We have a new version of an old favorite at my house thanks to Turbo01 and this gem! BTW I usually put this dip in a bread bowl. I hollow out the bread bowl and slather the inside cavity with EVOO and bake it till it gets all crispy and golden Then put the dip in it. That way the bowl holds up and has even More flavor! The bread from inside can be toasted at the same time and used at a dipper.",

The only thing I changed was to add a second package of chopped spinach.  With only 1 pkg it is VERY light on the spinach and in my opinion 2 was just right :)  I will definitely make this again!",

This recipe offered a deeper flavor than other spinach dips I've tried and the jicama has a more pleasing texture than water chestnuts which can feel like styrofoam in my opinion! This is a keeper. Served with pita chips but we've been spreading the leftovers (recipe makes a ton) on slices of bread.",

I also used the suggestion of another rate that recommended putting the bread in the oven with a little olive oil. Made the bread nice a crispy to tear off and enjoy. Also i didn't have bread available so i used a 1/2 cup of crushed up saltine crackers and soaked them in the cream. NOTE: crush them well. The Jicama is so much better than the water chestnuts!!!",
