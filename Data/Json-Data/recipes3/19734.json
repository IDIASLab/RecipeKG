I used 3/4c apple juice instead of an apple added 1/2 sliced onion cubed the pork in at least inch cubes & browned very dark (maybe the people who said it was dry made the meat cubes too small?) and after an hour it came out wonderful with tender pork. I'll double the recipe next time to be sure there's leftovers.",
