I added a little Frank's Hot Sauce in with the eggs when I beat them. My sons and I ate pretty much this whole thing--my littlest especially enjoyed it. I think this would make a GREAT breakfast burrito too. This was very filling and quick to make. I'm going to make this again this weekend and add some fresh vegetables like chopped red pepper onion garlic and mushrooms and maybe a little cheese.",

I made as-is except for omitting the paprika and adding Tony's but that was personal preference. I also didn't have a cheesy smoked sausage but I just sprinkled a handful of cheddar cheese over the kielbasa in the pan and that worked out well. One thing I did do was pour the raw eggs over the sausage/potato mix and then cook it like that. Which was great and saved a pan but I think cooking the potatoes in the oven might give them more of a roasted flavor. The eggs also stuck a bit to the pan cooked like that. You NEED to try this.

I added some heavy whipping cream to the beaten eggs and like a previous reviewer I poured the eggs over the tots and sausage and then topped it with mozzarella AND cheddar cheese since I also didnt have the cheesy sausages only smoked sausage. I baked it for 30 minutes. Anyways everyone LOVED this meal. I was VERY impressed at how versatile this recipe is because I am one of those people that has to read te directions step by step for mac and cheese still!!!!! LOL... Thanks OP!",
