I love salty but most don't. It turned out that everyone loved it. 12 guests asked for the recipe. I changed the recipe slightly - here's what I did - I stuffed the cups with a piece of blue cheese then covered it with the ricotta mixed with parmesan nutmeg pepper & salt then baked them. I then topped them with fig sauce. The fig sauce (for the Canadians it's PC Memories of Tuscany sauce)really made it. Gave it a little sweet/tangy taste to offset some of the salt from the prosciutto. Frankie just want say thanks for the recipe. I don't think I'd have ever thought to use prosciutto as a cup!",

I bought expensive Boar's Head Prosciutto sliced sandwich style and made 24 mini-muffin cups full and had PLENTY of prosciutto left.  So I may only get about a half pound next time.  The cups were a little difficult to make, but if the meat starts falling apart, just shove it in there.  It seems to hold its shape well after baking.  I mixed 1/2 cup of ricotta w/ 1/2 cup of feta a bit of parmesan.  I used all 10oz of a frozen spinach package so mine was REALLY spinachy.  I would recommend mixing the garlic in with the ricotta to get an even mix.  The garlic kind of stuck in one corner after mixing and left some bites a bit TOO garlicky (if that is possible :))  the end product was good.  It was a nice low carb addition to the gathering.  It went really well with red wine.  It also was very good cooled down or hot.  It reheated well the next morning in the microwave for breakfast too.",
