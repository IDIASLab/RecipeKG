For me that meant substituting fresh tomatoes for the sun-dried which just weren t moving me in a cold salad. It also meant not stirring crushed garlic into a hot pan where you re blackening chicken which I had Hubs do outside on the gas grill (even tho it s 36 degrees outside!) in a cast iron skillet. I still wanted the garlic flavor however so I added some minced to the salad dressing instead. I needed to adjust the salad dressing as well to my preferred oil to vinegar ratio of 3:1. Equal parts vinegar and oil would be far too vinegary for me. Everything is in balance here and I especially liked the mix of the peppery arugula with the milder greens and the mild creamy avocado against the spicy blackened chicken. Rather than dice everything and toss it altogether I topped the greens with the tomatoes olives and slices of avocado then arranged a sliced chicken breast on each. Great salad that does both the taste buds and body good.",
