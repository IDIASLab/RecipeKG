The only thing I did differently was I halved the amount of cayenne and black pepper it called for and added 2/3 cup of brown sugar (made the recipe based on 10 servings). I slow cooked a 5lb. pork butt roast added the sauce it was delicious. Next time I make this sauce I'll use 3/4 of the cayenne and pepper it calls for. I like it hot!!!",
