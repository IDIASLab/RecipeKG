I used Polish sausage because that's what I had and used light cream cheese along with subbing evaporated milk for the half and half. If you don't like mushrooms it's easy to use another veg such as chopped bell peppers broccoli etc. This is a keeper. On 5/23/19 I made this again. This time I added some sliced zucchini and yellow squash that I kept firm since we prefer veggies that way. I also cut some calories by using 2% milk. With all the cheese olive oil and butter it still tasted rich. It was excellent and since I like having one pot meals this will remain a keeper. Next time I might try with some shrimp.",
