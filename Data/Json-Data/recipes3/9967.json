I take it out at dinner time to let it warm just a bit, and we roll them out and ice them after for dessert. You use different flavors of extract and add spices. For fall, I use maple extract and add cinnamon and nutmeg. I use my mixer to prepare dough and it comes together super easy.",

Maybe because it calls for confectioner's sugar instead of granulated.  We didn't let these chill for more than 20 minutes and they were still fine.  They were also delicious and were eaten up while they were still too hot to hold.  This recipe will stay in the recipe box for a long time.",

This recipe was perfect because besides being super simple to mix up it makes a smaller batch and that's just what I was looking for. These kept their shape well and have a great buttery flavor. They do sort of 'puff' a bit but do not spread. The kids are really enjoying being the taste testers too! Though these will not replace my favorite cut-out cookie recipe I will def be making them again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

It's a good recipe to make a small batch. 4 stars because I had to do a couple modifications to fit my taste: 3/4 cups of conf. sugar instead of 1/2 cup 1 full stick butter instead 6 tbsp. What I love about the recipe is the taste of cookies not too crumbly with a little crisp and easy ingrediens. Also this dough is versatile. I tried it with a cookie press right after mixing ingredients - great results! Now my modified version of this recipe is my to go recipe for baking spritz or roll out cookies. Oh try to substitute 1/2 cup of flour with cocoa powder - you'll get wonderful chocolate cookies!! Definitely try this recipe!",
