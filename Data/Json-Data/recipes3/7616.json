I cut the recipe in half just to give it a try and it was very filling. Scrambling eggs with a bit of milk gets them nice and fluffy. Since I didn't have green galic I just used a bit of minced garlic. I also cut back just a bit on the salt and pepper using it only to taste. This was delicious with whole grain toast and OJ but would also be great tucked into some flour tortillas for a breakfast wrap!",
