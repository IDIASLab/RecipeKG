I enjoyed your video that goes with this recipe. These bars have nice flavor. I used almonds pumpkin seeds raisins and cranberries. I used oat bran in lieu of wheat germ. If you cut into these bars when they are warm they are very crumbly. Wait until they cool and they are perfect granola bars!",

My taste buds think that they are too greasy and salty but my husband really likes them! Also they are a bit too crumbly.

They ended up just too hard to eat. I thought I could salvage them into granola with milk. However they never softened up. To top the taste was like over-cooked peanuts or peanut butter and hard fruit. I wish I didn't waste all of those ingredients. My only suggestion is to keep a good eye on these especially when they are coming close to being done.",
