It was yummy and easy! I used fresh beets. washed and trimmed them up, cut them into chunks and boiled/steamed them in water. I blended some of the beets up using a hand blender. Part of the reason why it might have been so tasty was because I used a combination of full-fat buttermilk and full-fat greek yogurt (what I had in the fridge).",
