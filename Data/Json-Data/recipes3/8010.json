You can always cut the MSG and add more salt.\nMy wife can't eat beef, so I substitute ground turkey with no real effect on the taste (although I'm sure if you did a side by side test you could tase the difference).\n  I have since tweaked the recipe by adding a couple cans of black beans to the mix.\n  Someday I'll try the recipe with shredded meat instead of ground because, I heard somewhere that it's a federal law that all chili recipes must be tweaked, altered, adulterated, and/or destroyed at least once by adding ostrich meat or saut\u00e9ed beaver tail.\n  Since Dad's original recipe was written on a piece of an old paper shopping bag, I'm sure he won't mind a little creativity.",
