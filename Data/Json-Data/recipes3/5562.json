At every family gathering she'd make the best chicken and noodles, dropping her prepared noodles into homemade chicken broth along with shredded cooked chicken, then serving them over mashed potatoes. I've made them many times and everyone loves them. When making multiple batches, and lacking counter space, I hang the rounds on clean plastic hangers to dry.",

This dough is so easy to work with!  They were dried on a clothes rack set up in the kitchen.\nThey went into a a wonderful turkey broth using up the last of the Thanksgiving turkey.  TRY THIS RECIPE!  It will not disappoint! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Made these with my young grandchildren who loved getting their hands on the dough.

I mixed the dry ingredients together and put it in the food processor and started mixing as I poured in the wet ingredients. I used half the salt and added lemon pepper seasoning. (The food processor takes the work out of making the dough!) I let the dough sit for about 20 minutes then rolled it out. WOW! It rolls beautifully and I could get it quite thin. I loved that it didn't stick together and that it was so easy to handle. This makes very light noodles and the texture was wonderful and didn't turn soggy when boiled. This will be my base recipe for all my homemade pastas from now on!!!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!",
