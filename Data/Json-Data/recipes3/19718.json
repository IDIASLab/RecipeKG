Taking that into consideration, I socked the seasoning to the meat/onion while it was browning -- salt & pepper, a lot of garlic, oregano and basil and a heavy dose of both red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.  Also sprinkled some of all those things over the cabbage I'd chopped (I estimate 10-12 cups, fairly large head).  To avoid \"mushy\" cabbage, I gave the rice a head start -- added the tomato sauce & half the broth to the browned meat/onion, then stirred in the rice, turned the burner off and let it hang out for about 10-15 mins.  I tossed it all together in a large bowl, poured into lasagna dish (way too much for 9x13) and baked covered for 50 mins.  Excellent!  Rice cooked perfectly and cabbage, while softened, still had a slight crunch.  Try this one, and don't be afraid to add a LOT of seasonings! :)",

Stirred the rice into the pot with the meat and onions.  In a large, deep, foil roasting pan, I put a layer of cabbage and covered that with the meat/rice mixture.  I poured a cup of beef broth over the top and then added the spaghetti sauce on top of everything.  Covered with foil, and baked for 45 minutes.  After 45 min, I took it out of the oven, stirred it all together and then turned the oven down to 225 because I had to go out for an hour.  When we came back and had a taste test, it was PERFECT.  My BF loves my cooking, but he had 2 servings for his taste test, took some for his lunch today and wants me to make it again on the weekend!  I haven't seem him rave like this in a long time.

I modified the recipe quantities quite a bit so that I wouldn't end up with 2 9x13 pans of the stuff.  I guess I didn't cut back enough - I had a 6qt slow cooker full!  I added more rice and broth (1.5 c rice, 3 c broth), some diced tomatoes (14 oz), and a dash of chili powder, as well.  If you're going to slow-cooker this, you'll need about 6 hours on high, minimum, to cook the cabbage (I used 3 hours to start, and we crunched our way through supper the first nite!).  This is excellent served with sour cream and/or a nippy cheddar sprinkled on top. Yummy!",

After browning the beef in my large stock pot, I added the rest of the ingredients except the cabbage.  I brought it to a boil, reduced to a simmer, and put the cabbage on top of it all (didn't stir it).  Put the lid on and let everything simmer for 15 minutes; cabbage was nicely steamed and rice got cooked.  I halved the recipe since I only have a family of 3, and that was very easy to do.  Overall I really liked the flavor, though I did add plenty of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and 1Tb of brown sugar (to cut the tomato acidity).  Nothing beats a homemade cabbage roll, but this was a good way to cheat :)",

I am an experienced cook and AGAIN tried this and folloed it and the cabbage was mushy and the flavors just weren't there.
