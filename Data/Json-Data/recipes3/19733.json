All Recipes has changed a few quantities - you many want to use a but more garlic salt as well as some onion salt.  Also - be liberal with oregano and black pepper.  This dish is meant to be lightly fried and then baked.  If you only fry it, it will be tougher.  It is also meant to be s soft breading (not soggy)not crispy, but that, of course, is personal perference.  In my family is is usually served with applesauce, mashed potatoes, and green beans.",

Then I dredged the pork in flour, then in egg mixed with a large clove of garlic and about a Tbsp. of water.  Last, I dredged each pork slice in bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.  I added butter and olive oil to my pan and cooked it until golden brown.  I skipped baking the pork as the pieces were so thin, by the time they were done browning, they were cooked.  I skipped the \"breadings\" part too.  I served the pork on a big platter sprinkled with chopped Italian parsley and some lemon wedges....our dinner guests loved it and so did we.",

So, when I saw this recipe I decided to do it the same way, but instead of using chops using the tenderloin pounded down just a bit. I always use Italian style bread crumbs and just eyeball extra seasonings to add like garlic powder, cracked black pepper, dried parsley, Italian seasoning and some grated Parmesan cheese. I always dip my pork chops into the egg/milk mixture then the seasoned bread crumbs and then repeat that procedure (double dipping). This gives the pork a thick breading and keeps it moist while baking. To cut calories and time I spray the bottom of a glass baking dish with Pam, place the breaded pork in (no frying needed) then spray the pork with a little Pam, cook at 350 for 20 minutes, turn and cook for another 20 - 25 minutes depending on thickness. They'll come out moist and tender. I also do the \"breadings\" thing again without the frying. I also don't cover my pork while it's baking. Overall, a really good recipe!",

I added a few extra spices like garlic and onion powder and also some parmesan cheese. It got rave reviews. I only covered the pan for 1/2 the baking time. It cooked sooner than the recipe said so watch your meat thermometer. Very tender and delicious. This goes into my favorite recipe file.",

The only thing that DIDN'T work well (and why I didn't give 5 stars) were the \"breadings\" - they turned out like a rubbery \"scrambled egg\" topping (which is what they basically are)... I realize that the recipe calls for the remaining large amount of eggs and bread crumb mixture to be used as \"breadings\" added in at the end - but I would reccommend not adding them back to the dish as a topping.
