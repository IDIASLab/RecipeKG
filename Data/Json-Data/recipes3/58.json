Gather some fancy cellophaned toothpics and a couple of big woody carrots peeled and some pimentos. Slice a disc off of the carrot and cut a small wedge from that disc. Insert the little wedge you cut from it into one of the smaller olives. Then cut a slit in a large olive and fill with cream cheese so that the cream cheese shows. Use the fancy toothpick to hold the big olive (with cream cheese showing) to the carrot disc and the small olive on top - it's a penguin! The little carrot wedge is its beak! A slice of pimento can be wrapped around its \"neck\" like a scarf. The wedge cut from the disk makes it look like its feet. They're quick and utterly adorable!!!!! I serve them on a fake \"beach\" made from blue colored unflavored jello and raw white rice covered with cling wrap but they're cute just gathered on a tray looking for a good Christmas party! Always a hit!",

I love olives and I love cream cheese but the olive doesn't hold enough cream cheese so it's very over powering. I would suggest fresh olives and not canned because of the strong olive taste. Also it's very hard to make it look pretty. As soon as I had 6 or so standing one would fall and cause a domino effect. The toothpicks don't help them stand either.",
