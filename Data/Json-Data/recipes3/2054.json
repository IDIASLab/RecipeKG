I have made these several times with baking powder, w/o baking powder, rolled thin, rolled thick, dried out , not dried out.  Personally like to add the baking powder it makes them a bit more airy, I also like them rolled  thicker, & they don't need to be dried out at all.  I make them & in to the pot they go,very quick & easy.  These noodles are also great the next day as they sit over night in the soup they don't get mushy.  Yummy comfort food!",

                "reviewBody": "Good recipe but should definitely double amount for a family of 4.  To make sure noodles aren't tough, do not knead. Kneading this at all will make a rubbery, tough noodles.  Mix the dough until ingredients are just combined.  I mix all the ingredients in a KitchenAid mixer then rolled it out by hand. To minimize overworking the dough, mix all the wet ingredients first before adding to the flour. I then divided the dough ball into two halves (4 sections if doubling the recipe) and wrapped in plastic to let it sit for about 20 min to let the gluten relax. This will make rolling easier and prevent shrinking. I then cut the pasta with a pizza cutter and immediately cooked them.  No need to wait 2 hrs. Also, I found 1/4 tsp of baking powder was plenty to give the pasta some airiness.  Freezes well too, just make sure to flour cut noodles well before freezing.  A great simple recipe.  4 stars for lack of directions, 5 stars for recipe itself.",

The only suggestion I have is to make sure you flour the surface that you are rolling them out on, otherwise the dough can be a little sticky.  They do nearly double in size once you boil them.  I boiled them for 5 minutes in a pot of water with one chicken stock cube, drained them, and then added the noodles to my homemade chicken noodle soup that was boiling for the last 5 minutes.  I did not use the baking powder.  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks for this easy, yet delicious, noodle recipe!",

I throw them in a bowl, sprinkle in a little flour, so everyone gets coated a little and chuck them into  boiling chicken stock (with shredded chicken already in it) and cook just until the noodles are done and the broth thickens up. I love chicken and noodles over mashed potatoes. Yes, it's heavy on the starch, but boy, is it ever good (Midwest-style) eating. My mom used to fix it that way when I was a little girl and I'm proud to carry on the tradition.",
