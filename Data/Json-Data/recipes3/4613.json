Also for the meat portion I use Hawaiian Portuguese Sausage and add golden raisins. Instead of the applesauce I dice Fuji apples.

I skipped the apples and applesauce all together I don't like fruits with veggies in a recipe. I didn't quite dump in the entire pound of dry bread cause I was afraid of dry stuffing.
