I used cream of Celery instead of cream of Chicken soup and Mozzerella on top with a bit of Kraft greated parmesan (in the green container) instead of grated Parmesan cheese. And also I was getting sick of using Spaghetti noodles for my pasta dishes so I used Fettucini. I think that the next time that I make it I wont bake it like a casserole instead just use the tarragon sauce like an alfredo sauce on my fettucini noodles on the side of a chicken breast. But overall it was a fantastic simple dish that seemed like it would take allot more effort than it truely did. Everyone was amazed with me!",

Instead of cream of chicken soup I used cream of mushroom I swapped out 1 cup of half and half for milk used fresh tarragon instead of dried and I added about a tsp of garlic powder (I can't live without garlic!). I also added salt which I found it needed at the end. This was so good! My boyfriend even enjoyed it and I wasn't sure he would like the tarragon taste.
