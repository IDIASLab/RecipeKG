I used more pork and bamboo shoots than the recipe called for, as I had leftover mustard seasoned pork and a very large can of bamboo shoots. I went up in the other ingredients to compensate somewhat, but stuck to the one dried chili pepper, and less red pepper flakes. Better on the side of caution for the first time. It is definitely a make again dish in our household. I served it with Japanese Soba noodles, and stir fried green beans sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. There simeroom for variations to the recipe, like adding broccoli florets, or adding a touch of orange zest.",

Shaoxing cooking wine for the real stuff.. forgot the chicken broth and used twice the soy sauce b/c i was using low sodium.. and i had to leave out the green onions b/c i didn't have any.. it's amazing how much flavor was infused into the bamboo shoots.. ty for giving me something else to make them into",
