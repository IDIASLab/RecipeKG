I omitted the lime because it just didn't sound good and just used sesame oil (for more asian flavor) chopped garlic chopped ginger and some ground peppercorn. Very very good. Smelled so wonderful while cooking. Make sure to use either fresh ginger or use the chopped ginger in a jar- it will stay fresh in the fridge for a long time.",

The lime taste is very strong. I usually prefer to marinade my meat over night or longer if possible but decided to grill chicken at the last minute. This recipe was perfect marinade any longer that 20 minutes and the acid from the lime juice will start to cook the chicken.",

I prepared the chicken on a George Foreman Grill and it was done in five minutes. I used bottled lime juice and olive oil gave it a nice flavor. I will use this recipe again when I'm in a hurry. This is a nice lowfat meal. I served it with fresh green beans and noodles. Thanks Susan!",
