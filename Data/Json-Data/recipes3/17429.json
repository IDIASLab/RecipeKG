I did not use the Fast Chicken Stock recipe -- used Better Than Boullion brand chicken base cooked two skinless chicken breasts in the pressure cooker with the tomatoes and herbs (used fresh rosemary and dried thyme) and added two cloves of fresh garlic. Added the white beans pasta and a little salt/pepper when the chicken was cooked. It was really good -- especially on a chilly night! I made this a second time today and doubled the recipe. This time did not put chicken in it. It was declicious. Again used fresh garlic sauteed in olive oil. This time added some white wine and a little bit of oregano as well. Wonderful!",
