(probably ended up being the same as in the recipe I was sceptical but don't skip this!! It makes the salad!) I did not have green chiles or fresh cilantro but I had a large jar of HOT salsa and added some of that. Love all the ingredients! SO healthy. I just added about 1-2 TBS of olive oil Mayo and that smoothed it out rather cut the heat a bit. I like it with and without the mayo. I had to add more salsa and cumin after I added the mayo. (I like it with a kick) The cumin really changes this and adds an awesome taste to this. My new Fav power lunch. I used lots of yellow green red and orange pepper. (I had all of that on hand) I had to let you know how great this is! I used to just mix a TBS of mayo and salsa to my can of tuna (My sis taught me that. I thought it was gross when I saw her do that but it is good) I will never do that again. Can't wait to have my sis taste this one... SSSOOOOO YUMMY! THANKS!!!!",

I usually try to follow recipes to the letter when I'm trying them for the first time, but I had to make a few changes to use what I had on hand.  I only used 2 pouches (2.6oz) of albacore white tuna, a few thin slices of red onion, 1/3 of a green bell pepper, and a little bit of miracle whip in leiu of the mayo.  I also went light on the cumin and used a few spoonfuls of Rotel instead of salsa verde.  I do wish that I had cilantro, but it is really tasty without it too!  I will definitely make again!!",

Eyeballed the mayo - as always - and stuffed it in a toasted whole wheat pita for a scrumptious healthy dinner!",

Who knew tuna would be so good with a Mexican twist!The true key to this recipe is to let it sit for a few hours in the fridge before digging in - the extra time helps the spice come out! I used hot salsa instead of salsa verde since our family loves spicy stuff and I found this to be excellent in a whole wheat tortilla or on top of greens for a fun salad. I like others also used tuna in water not oil and really enjoyed the taste and lack of oiliness in the salad (I don't see why they'd want it in olive oil tell you the truth). Will definitely make again maybe for a party as it made a great dip with tortilla chips or Wheat Thins!",

I use green onions toasted cumin substitute dried parsley for cilantro and drizzle with garlic olive oil (I usually use tuna packed in water). So fresh flavorful and crunchy! I don't ever seem have salsa verde or green chiles around but a scrape of frozen pureed chipotles does the trick for even more flavor. Also I rinse the beans. Mayonnaise seems redundant but I use a little anyway and it adds creaminess without being too heavy. Thanks for a great versatile recipe!",
