Instead I substituted celery & red onion. I also used 1/2 mayo & 1/2 miracle whip. I only used 1/2 the mixture as I prefer the eggs moist. Delicious on the 1st bite! I saved the leftover dressing in case I need to add more to the leftovers. Perfect way to use up some of that paprika my Dad brought me (the non-cooker) back from Hungary. Thanks Deb!",

Make egg salad! I never would have thought to put water chestnuts in egg salad but I loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and then added chopped celery (because I like it) and ground tumeric (health reasons--the curcumin in it). I used free pasture eggs so the yolks were bright orange to start with. So the addition of dried mustard paprika and tumeric made for a very interesting dark gold/copper is color! I think I could have used less mayo--it wasn't runny but I like my egg salad a little firmer if that makes sense. I also should have squeezed the juice out of the relish or used just chopped picked instead. I liked the taste! I put this on gluten-free toast and I loved it. Good recipe thank you. I will make this again.",
