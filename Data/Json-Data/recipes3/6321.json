Put them tortillas with low fat sour cream and a bit of cheese..yum!! Will make these fajitas from now on!",

For a more authentic mexican flavor though, use salsa instead of tomatos(from a real mexican restruant), just regular smoked bacon instead of peppered. Use salt, cajun seasoning, fajita seasoning (Any will do), pepper, and a little chili powder for the chickens seasoning. And Use small tortilas not big burrito size, Then Wet them slightly, wrap them in foil, and sit them in the oven for about 8 mins. add onions too, even if you dont like them they really snaz up the flavor. Other wise leave everything else the same cause this is a pretty good recipe!!",

I didn't have cilantro so I put montreal chicken seasoning in it. I think it needs more spices. Next time I will probably add greek with feta and oregano dressing in the fajita. Yum.",

It was very difficult to get the bacon pieces crispy once it was mixed in and no longer always touching the bottom of the pan. I omitted the green pepper and cilantro (personal preference) but added some cumin. Even though I love bacon I think this recipe would be better without it (or crumble fully cooked bacon in at the very end). Thanks for the recipe anyway!",
