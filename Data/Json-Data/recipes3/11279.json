I only had to bake for 20 minutes.  We enjoyed this as a side dish with baked chicken.  Thank you, bryantgal31 for sharing your easy and delicious recipe.",

Halved recipe as just hubby & I didn't have enough sour cream so I had to supplement with about 1/4 cup of plain yogurt; out of Monterey Jack so used a combo of white American and cheddar; out of chopped canned peppers so used a few diced jalapenos I had available. Yeah I know. But don't care. Because this was delicious. Served with BBQ pork chops tossed green salad and corn. Thanks SO much for recipe - we loved it!",
