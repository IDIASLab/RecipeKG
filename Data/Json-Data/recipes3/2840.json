This was so simple I literally threw it together in minutes! I didn't have onion or garlic powder so I used 1 garlic clove (pressed) and 2 green onions (chopped). It tasted great and looked beautiful! I normally have a very sensative palate when it comes to Mexican flavoring...the milder the better. With that in mind I felt that the cumin in this was right on. (I even used the red pepper!) It has a really great \"Mexican\" flavor that is not overpowering. I will definately keep this and the ingredients on hand to make VERY often! It was also a big hit at the meeting! I even got approval from my Hispanic friend! Thanks for the recipe!:o)",

Used elbow macaroni used the canned diced petite tomatoes cut down on a cumin just a little used salad supreme instead of garlic powder simply because I didn't have any garlic powder. I used lots of italian dressing and let it sit overnight. The dressing soaks in alot and it turned out perfect. I also used frozen corn instead of canned had a really nice crush.",
