I did have to use about 2 cans of chicken broth for the lentils to get somewhat soft. I added a dollop of sour cream half of a cut up avocado and salsa to top it off. My husband who is a die hard meat lover even liked the nachos. Won't make it often but every once in a while these will come as a nice change of pace.",

I recommend adding a can of diced chilies if you want some warmth to the dish, you absolutely need to double the liquid to soften the lentils, I just eye balled it after my broth was absorbed 15 minutes into the simmer.
