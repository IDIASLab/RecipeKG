When frying the onion I also add 2 cloves of garlic and chopped up carrot (or sometimes with a frozen veggie mix - carrot beans peas and corn). I then spray the pan with cooking spray. When I transfer the rice to the dish I add another approx. 1/8 cup of chicken broth. I then stir rice about every 10 mins to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the dish or from getting to crunchy on top. When cooking I also add about another 1/8 cup of broth. I have cooked the rice at 350 as well (due to having something else in the oven) and cooked it for an extra 10 minutes - I did not have to add the extra broth during cooking this way. This rice is fantastic - my husband requests it at least once a week enjoy!",
