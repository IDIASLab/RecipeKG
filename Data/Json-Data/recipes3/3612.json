First I wilted 3 8oz. bags of baby spinach adding no butter or oil put in strainer and pressed water out. Then I sauted 8oz. sliced mushrooms with the 1/2 onion called for added 1 minced garlic clove the juice of 1/2 a lemon and a few drops of worcestershire sauce (last 2 ingredients were suggested in one of the reviews I read). Mixed spinach into mushroom mixture. Put in casserole dish and topped with the cheese. I did not use any butter and only a tiny bit of olive oil with the mushrooms! It still was a little greasy I guess from the cheese. But the flavor was fabulous. Next time I will omit the cheese called for and just sprinkle with parm-regg. Thanks for the base recipe but I can't imagine all that butter.",

No seasoning, so I added some garlic. Also, I didn't see the need to cook the spinach separately from the mushrooms--a pointless extra step that just takes more time and dirties an extra pan. I just cooked the mushrooms, onion and garlic first, then added the spinach to the same pan--and frankly, I should have left it at that and stopped there. Finally, other than to melt a mild cheese (I also adjusted for that by using a sun-dried tomato/basil cheddar) I don't see what the purpose is of placing already cooked spinach in the oven--except to overcook it. This has potential, I guess, with a pretty major overhaul, but as written it's just not that great a recipe. ",

First I halved it which was perfect for just me and leftovers (someone suggested serving it with shrimp over rice which I plan to try b/c it was so good). I also took others advice and just sauteed the mushrooms onions and spinach in the same pan with a light layer of cooking spray instead of butter. I didn't remove the stems (it seemed like a waste of time and still tasted fine). I added a splach of worchesterchire and lemon juice before putting it in the dish to bake. Instead of cheddar which I think would overpower the flavor of the veggies I used a small amount of swiss and covered the rest in an italian blend of romano parm mozz and guyer.",
