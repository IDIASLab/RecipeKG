First off- I would not cover it while cooking. It seemed more boiled than it was baked. I like my wings a little more candied. Plus- I would add half the amount of italian dressing than called for. The ingredients are complimentary- but the italian dressing overpowers the apricot/onion taste that I believe would be tasty.",
