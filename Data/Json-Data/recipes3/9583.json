To get really get all the flavor out of your saffron (for this many other recipes that call for both saffron and milk), I recommend dry roasting it for a few minutes in a pan and then crushing it with mortar and pestle. Add the milk to that bowl and mix until all the saffron is incorporated and the milk turns to that gorgeous golden yellow. Then, add that milk to your potatoes. This is a great twist on your usual mashed potatoes, next time I'll even try it with sweet potatoes. Thanks for sharing!",
