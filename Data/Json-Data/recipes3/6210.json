The soup has so much depth with the sage pear shallots and hint of ginger. The only changes I made were 2 cloves of garlic instead of 3 and evaporated milk in place of the cream. Evaporated milk imparts the same texture and taste without all the fat and calories. This makes 4 servings not 6. The soup would do best with a garnish if served to company as it is not very pretty. The flavor more than makes up for the color. Thank you Simone for a fabulous recipe.",

It is nowhere near 6 servings though and the serving size should be adjusted. I will make this again for myself for lunches and add some croutons on the top for crunch. This time I added a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of paprika as it is not too beautiful looking (although it is beautiful tasting). Thanks!",
