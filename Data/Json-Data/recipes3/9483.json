I don't like rosemary, so I don't use that, but garlic powder is tasty, too.  I don't use fresh garlic, because I think these need to cook at a higher temp and for longer than 30 minutes, and the garlic would burn.  I would suggest at least 425 for really nicely browned pieces.  Mine never get super crispy, but I don't care...I love them!",

I cooked 30 mins and then flipped and cooked another 10 mins. I may have had too many on the pan because they were close together and maybe that's why they weren't as crunchy or maybe this is just how they are. They were a great snack though will make again.",
