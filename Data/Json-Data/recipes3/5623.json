If you like it spicier, add more. \n\nI also use more potato, but that's because my grandma always used a lot in hers and I love them. \n\nI'm making this tomorrow for a dinner party and plan on:\n\nCooking the potatoes for a few minutes to start them softening. Cut the pieces small and they will cook faster. \n\nThen I'll add onion, bell pepper, jalape\u00f1o, and garlic and cook for a few minutes. \n\nAdd the ground turkey and brown it. \n\nAdd fresh chopped tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce and a little water because I definitely do not like super dry Picadillo. \n\nBring all that to a simmer and begin adding spices. Salt, pepper, cumin, Sriracha powder. \n\nLet that cook, stirring occasionally. \n\nOnce it's looking good and cooked, taste it! \n\nOnce the flavor levels are where I like them, I will throw in some fresh spinach and stir until it's wilted.\n\nDone! \n\nIf it's too soupy, keep cooking until it thickens some. \n\nI've also done a variation using sweet potatoes.
