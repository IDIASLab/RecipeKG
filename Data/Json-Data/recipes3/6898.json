I left out the cheese because I figured it would be creamy and yummy enough with the sour cream and avocado and so I might as well ditch the excessive calories (not that I have anything against cheese it was a whim!). I was also too lazy to make rolled enchiladas so I layered the tortillas and fish \"New Mexican style\" but to be honest I think this recipe would have been much better if I had taken the time to roll them so next time I will. Cilantro and lime on top of the finished product makes it perfect! Thanks!",
