Well... he was the first one up for a second helping and that was before our two children voiced their approval of the meal as well. I added cornstarch more broth and a blend of sour cream/milk to make it more 'soupy' like a wet curry(I didn't have any cream on hand) and followed the advice for a fresh chopped onion instead of the onion powder. Such an excellent flavorful taste especially for such little work. Thank you for posting it.",

I left most of the liquids in the pan (and I pre-cooked and drained the spinach) so I recommend reducing cream and/or broth by half or so. Good flavor... an interesting combo. Might be good over rice. Definitely not 4 servings. I suggest adjusting the recipe to use 1 breast per serving needed.",

I also used curry powder instead of the other spices then added a can of coconut milk and about a 1/4 of honey a squirt of lemon juice and lime juice it tastes amazing! thanks for your inspiration!!!",
