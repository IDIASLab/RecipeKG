I took the advice of others and added double the cream soup and double the broth...a must (just don't double anything else except the flour).  I think I might prefer it just a tad bit thicker but it was excellent!  I also added freshly sliced mushrooms and two cups of cheddar cheese.  Will definately make again!

I made it in a pieplate also so just increased the dough recipe as someone suggested (by 4 to have top and bottom crusts for both pies). I doublesifted the dough ingredients rather than just mixing in order to better distribute the sage. I also made the cream of chicken/flour mixture in a big bowl and added the spices and cooked chicken first and then the vegetables. Also with a 9 inch pie plate there were some extra vegetables left over. Personally I would cut down the carrots or potatoes and keep the frozen vegetables. Broccoli is a good choice for this meal. My mix had frozen soybeans in it and they were good too. I took the suggestion to add cheese - I used parmesan and it added a nice subtle flavor. I will definitely make this again. Note: this meal is a fairly big time commitment.",

For the people who thought this wasn't creamy enough: try adding just 1 can of soup a bit of milk and mash up some of the potatoes - that gives a creamy mouth feel without overwhelming the taste of all the other ingredients with condensed soup. I just boiled potatoes in their skins until past fork-soft cooled them then pulled them apart with my fingers and with a knife - which leaves behind some mashed portions and small bits of skin that contrasts well with the softer parts of the pie filling.",
