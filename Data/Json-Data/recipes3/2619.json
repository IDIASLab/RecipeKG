Due to having to alter it, I would have given it 4 \u00bd stars if it was an option but it\u2019s not. It was a must to read others reviews for they gave very good insight as how to turn this into a 5 star recipes. I did add a few of my own ideals though.\r\n\r\n2 cans of soup is a must (I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cheese soup).\r\n4 slices of bread is also a must.\r\nI stirred fried my chicken with garlic and pepper instead of using the microwave and no garlic.\r\nI added 1 cup of chopped onion, 2 cups of frozen broccoli and increased the cheese to 3 cups, using \u00bd in the mixture and the other half on top of the bread cubes. I also poured melted butter on top of the bread topping.\r\n\r\nThis was a big hit with my husband. This is a great Sunday dish for you can pre-mix it and place it in the fridge until you get home from church, and then all you have to do is bake it and fix a side salad. It is also very good for a potluck dinner.  \r\n",

Oh I also increase the rice amount and use the amount of 2 cups of rice precooked. I top the dish with crumbled ritz crackers.

BEGINNING COOKS: Save this in your favorites!  This is a perfect base - some meat, some rice, a can of soup and a generous sprinkle of cheese.  Adjustments and additions are to be made according to taste (IE: herbs, spices, veggies, type of meat, flavor of soup, etc...). Viola!  Dinner is served.  My changes: I was out of almost all my cheeses so I combined them - five in all; seasoned the rice water with chicken boullion; seasoned the chicken with boullion, chives, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder; buttered both sides of 2 slices of bread, cubed it and placed on top.  Oh, and the reviewer who strongly suggested using your Pyrex for this - absolutely.  Cheese and metal are not the best of friends.",

To make a fast meal with the ingrediants on hand. Don't make if you want something that tastes fancy. But if you came from simple homes as a kid and you ate alot of \"throw together what ever is in the cabinet foods\" this is for you. It tasted better than I expected. In fact it tasted like chicken ala king that you get from school when it is all mixed together. (I liked school lunches). And the toasted bread on top is great just drizzle some melted butter on the top before cooking. Thank you for this easy and makeable meal we all enjoyed it alot.",
