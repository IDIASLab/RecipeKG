For those who don't have pumpkin seeds on hand it is very easy to toast the butternut squash seeds and use those in place of pumpkin seeds. Separate the seeds from the stringy mass then boil in 2 cups water with 1 tbsp salt for every 1/2 cup of seeds for about 10 minutes. Use more salt if you like saltier seeds. Toss them in a little olive oil and bake in a single layer in 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes. They will keep for days on your counter if closed tightly in a container.",

                "reviewBody": "INCREDIBLE! A few years ago, I tried a roasted squash soup at a local restaurant. They wouldn't give me the recipe, and I've been wanting to try and make it on my own.  This was the first recipe I've tried, and it was phenomenal.  Way better than the restaurant's version!  Overall, I left the ingredients pretty similar but changed the prep a little bit. I used a medium-sized butternut squash, which was about 9 cups, so I quadrupled the rest of the recipe. I saut\u00e9ed the squash, and when it was brown, I dumped it in a roasting pan along with the onion, celery, and carrots.  I drizzled a little olive oil over all and roasted for about 30 minutes at 400.  I brought my stock to a boil, and I added about a tsp of cinnamon (didn't have cinnamon sticks), nutmeg (for fun), and cumin (didn't have roasted coriander).  I then removed the celery, carrot, and onion from the roasting pan and added to stock. When veggies were soft, I strained them from the broth and blended in the blender.  I blended the squash as well, and I had to add broth as needed to liquefy it better.  When everything was blended well and stirred back together, I brought the soup to a low simmer and let it simmer for over an hour to thicken a little bit.  In the end, I had about 15 cups of soup.  I froze most of it and saved a small portion for my husband and I.  I added the 1/2 and 1/2 to our portion and served for supper.  Amazing.",

I did not add the pumpkin seeds or bread crumbs either.  I had a salad and some homemade bread with mine and it is definitely a keeper.  This recipe definitely only serves 4.

I'm very excited to introduce this to my holiday table. Next time I think I'll opt for the more health conscious plain low-fat yogurt.
