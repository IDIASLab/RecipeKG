We put them in the oven for 40 mins and it's a perfect amount of time. We paired them (this time) with the \"melt in your mouth meatloaf\" recipe on this site and steamed broccoli. It was a wonderful and filling meal that I will be making again soon!",

The directions and timing were just fine; I didn't change anything other than to scale back for 3 servings, and stir/flip the potato chunks a few times at the 20 and 30 min. mark to ensure more even nummy browning.",
