This recipe isn't very sweet which is great as I like to eat rice pudding for breakfast. I'm not sure that I like the orange flavor in rice pudding; I liked it better chilled. But I would prefer just using all almond milk and maybe coconut extract next time. I screwed up and without thinking cracked the egg in with the rice and milk. I cooked it anyway. It looked very eggy when I opened the lid but I kept stirring and was surprised at how well it all blended smoothly together. I'll be sure to follow the instructions next time! I just wanted to make an update that I added some dried cranberries to the leftovers and I liked the orange-cranberry combo.",

I was happy that it didn't stick/burn to my pan and the consistency was perfect for me at the 2 minute mark of stirring during the final saute step. I also liked the texture of the rice. I liked the level of sweetness and taste although I made it without orange zest or orange extract as I didn't have these. I will make this again.",
