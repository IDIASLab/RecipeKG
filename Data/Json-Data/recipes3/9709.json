I can't say I was overwhelmed with this recipe. I think it really needed some butter. I had to sprinkle quite a bit of salt on my portion to make it edible.",

I used 10 regular russet potatoes, cubed them up with the skin on & mixed with some of the sauce before pouring them into a greased dish. Then I poured the remaining sauce on top & covered the dish with aluminum foil...I baked them at 350\u00b0 for 45 minutes then removed the foil, topped with some more shredded chedder, chopped green onions & crispy crumbled bacon. Popped them back in the oven for an additional 15 minutes to brown the top & there was not one bite left! Excellent side dish for our tri tip steak & pork loin (I cook for 15+ on Sunday's) This will be in our dinner rotation forever!",
