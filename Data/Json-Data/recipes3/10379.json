I followed the ingredients as stated for 8 servings, but changed the dressing to 6 servings. Maybe if you're making 24 hours in advance you'd need that much dressing, but it was very nice and moist after four hours of marinating, as you can see by my photo. This salad presents very nicely and would be great for company or potlucks. I served with some cherry tomatoes and avocado slices which eventually got mixed in, a nice addition to a Mexican salad.",

I had bacon I needed to use, so I diced it up and cooked it, and it turned out to be great addition. I also added chick peas, and all colors of bell peppers to give it more color. I didn't have all the seasonings for the dressing, so I bought a premixed taco seasoning, which had the seasonings suggested for the recipe plus some other herbs. The salad turned out amazing, and was great addition to my bbq. Of note, my salad turned out to be a lot more than I was expecting.",

I tweaked the recipe only a smidge: for both my quinoa and brown rice, I used vegetable broth, doubled the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon, cut the 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt and instead used 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, and added one diced avocado. Affordable and convenient. Absolutely fantastic! Thank you for sharing!!",

I had to make some adjustments as I didn't have any beans either. I added the everything along with cucumbers, left out the salt and pepper, I like to add individually afterwards. I cut back the oil to 2/3 and added 1/3 of the vinegar. I haven't even let the flavours marinate together yet but snuck a bite and it is really tasty. Looking forward to what the family thinks tonight. I know they will love and this one will be a hit. Definitely give it a try.",

Oh and I am addicted to chipotle chili powder so I used a smidge of that for part of the chili powder. It is a great base salad recipe to work your own little personality into!",
