I added mushrooms as suggested by someone else, and we really liked that. One thing to note is that you have to be VERY careful heating the sour cream and half and half. Don't cook the proteins! They get gritty. I made that mistake. Make sure you have every ingredient measured and close at hand because it means it when it says,\" cook until just heated.\" It will get away from you in a hurry. I think next time I'll use fresh garlic. Overall, we loved it!",
