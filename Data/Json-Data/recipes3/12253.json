During the warm/hot months they are so refreshing and filling, right out of the freezer. They are also great for road trips when kept in a cooler. Thank you, Alli,  for the wonderful recipe. **UPDATE** 9/9/16 I make these all the time and have found that, when using a mini food processor, I get better results grinding the cashews before adding the other ingredients. They seem to hold their shape better even though larger bits of cashews was nice, they fell apart easily. Keep these in your freezer for those \"I need something sweet\" moments. Trust me, your kids will grab these instead of candy. These are the true LifeSavers!",
