I didn't have coconut flour so I used all almond flour and then added 2T of ground flaxseed which helps to keep a batter nice and moist.\n\nThese are so good that I've made them multiple times - my family begs me to make them.  They're good enough to eat plain, or with your favorite pancake fixings.  My husband said they shouldn't even be called pancakes because they are way better than any pancakes he's ever had.  :)\n\nThese are my favorite food right now.  As someone who can't have grains or sugars, this is a super big treat!  YAY!!!\n\nJust a note:  I do the sweet potato differently to save time:  I peel it, cut it into 1\" slices, coat with a bit of olive oil and sea salt on a baking sheet and bake at 400F for about 15-20 minutes, or until tender.\n\nADDED LATER:  I've made these with coconut flour, and tried to add the extra flax seed, and yeah, my batter wouldn't even mix together and I had to add almond milk and another egg to thin it out.   I prefer these without the coconut flour - with the coconut flour they are drier and denser.",

I made a few changes: I only used half the recommended coconut flour (tends to make it dry) and I used 3/4 the recommended banana. I didn't want the banana flavor to be over powering. I also added a touch (1/4 c or so) of milk bc the batter was still pretty thick. I plan on adding pecans next time which will help offset the spongey texture quite nicely. If you're gf paleo or on whole 30 this recipe is definitely a keeper!",
