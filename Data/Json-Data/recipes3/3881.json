I used extra virgin olive oil for even stronger flavor. I tenderized the chops first and let them marinate for about 6 hours and they held much of the moisture during grilling. Hubby gave it a big thumbs up -- I'm not a real fan of pork chops but I cleaned my plate as well because I enjoyed the flavor so much. Since I have half a jar of jelly left we'll definitely make this again.",
