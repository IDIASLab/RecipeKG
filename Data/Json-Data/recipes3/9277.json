                "reviewBody": "I don't think this is a well-written recipe. It doesn't tell you whether or not to drain the corn (I drained and used some of the liquid but not all) or when to add the pepper. It tells you to mix the dry ingredients into the sauteed veggies \"...until the mixture is bubbling...\" At this point the mixture won't bubble as there's not enough liquid in there. Next if you add the egg into the mixture without tempering you'll have scrambled eggs. It doesn't tell you to \"spray\" the casserole dish so you'll most likely end up with a dish that has baked-on corn. And four servings is more realistic than six. Sorry my intent is not to be super critical but I think the author assumes that anybody preparing this recipe would know to do all of these things forgetting that there are many beginning cooks on this site. And I also have to say that I think AR editing could have done a better job. Before pouring the corn mixture into the casserole I tasted it and felt there was too much salt it tasted like I'd used creamed corn instead of whole corn and that it was pretty bland. At this point I did add some shredded cheddar cheese but that was the only deviation from the recipe. I know I'm the first reviewer of this recipe and I don't want to discourage others from trying it. Taste always is subjective and these are just my personal opinions. Sorry BARELYBARBIE I rarely do 2-star reviews but this one just didn't work for us.",

I've not given up on this recipe but am going to pursue a way of making it creamier.",
