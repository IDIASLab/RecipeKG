They combine flour tortillas filled with breaded, fried tilapia, layered with chipotle mayo, topped with napa cabbage, dressed with honey-cumin sauce, and served with pico de gallo, sour cream, chips and salsa. You'll find them very refreshing and packed full of flavor!",

Do yourself a favor and give this one a try.  And do follow the recipe to a \"T\"...use the Panko bread crumbs as they fry up so much nicer than regular bread crumbs.  Also, some reviewers admitted to omitting the chipotle  peppers in adobo sauce, but this ingredient is what makes chipotle mayo just that, so you musn't dismiss it!  You can find small cans of these in the Latino food section of any major grocery store.  The Panko crumbs can be found in the Asian section of your grocery store.  The coleslaw that goes with the tacos is worthy enough to stand alone.  I can't say enough about these tacos...just try them!  You'll be shocked you could make something so different and delicious in your own kitchen.  ",

I am not a huge spicy food fan, I can usually handle a medium spiciness in foods, so I halved the cayenne pepper and the mayo was perfect, I could have licked it out of the bowl!!  I have made this twice, once with the fried tilapia, and once with grilled tilapia that was marinated the same way but not breaded (to try and make it a little healthier), and both ways were absolutely delish.  This recipe seems like a lot of ingredients and steps, but it is really quite easy.  Definitely give it a try!!  ",
