I can't imagine it being any better with snapper but I'm looking forward to trying it. I followed the recipe exactly (except for the flounder substitution) and it was spicy but not too spicy. Very easy to prepare and not too time consuming. It reminds me of an Italian dish without all the carbs of a typical Italian pasta dish. This will become a weekly meal at my house. Thank you for the fantastic recipe!:)",
