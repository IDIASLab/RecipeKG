This quick and easy salad is a huge hit whenever I serve it, and it easy to prepare ahead of time. Just wait until the last minute to combine the lettuce, croutons, dressing, and cheese. The key is to use real grated Parmesan cheese, not the stuff in the can.",

I did feel that the dressing ended up a bit salty for me, so I will reduce the salt next time, but other than that, this turned out delicious. LOVED the croutons! I made the dressing a little earlier, and allowed it to sit @ room temp to allow the flavors to blend. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I had run out of my boyfriends favorite dressing so I found this & made it- I made just the dressing because I was pressed for time. I put it over my boyfriend's favorite salad greens and it was his favorite part of the meal! I also served it at a recent party and got tons of compliments. I can't wait to try the full recipe with the home made croutons and the romaine lettuce. I am now making this every 3 or 4 days the dressing has become a staple in our house.
