They had all the incredible flavor you'd expect from some fancy restaurant and yet I made them in my own home for about two bucks and in about five minutes. Amazing. With garlic white wine and olive oil you just can't go wrong. The 'shrooms were meaty and delicious. note: I used half butter half olive oil another note: learn from my mistake and don't add the garlic early! It will burn and get bitter. (Even with the toasty garlic though this was SO yummy).",
