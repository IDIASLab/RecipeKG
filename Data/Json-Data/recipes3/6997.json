I really love the flavor of fenugreek but Husband does not at all. I liked the low fatness of using yogurt but I would have liked to add some heavy cream for a little more rich flavor. This is a good basic recipe that I would like to play around with. Thanks!",

Generally Avadhi cooking has marination involved and spices (delicately balanced) are used with 3 Tb spoons of chili powder and 3 tbsps of green chilies there is no Avadhi cooking this is recipe straight out of the Anarchist's Handbook. No offence is intended but pl check from some of your Indian friends who are from Uttar Pradesh India (earstwhile Avadh)",
