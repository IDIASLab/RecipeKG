The only minor adjustment I suggest is that after you remove the melted chips marshmallow and butter mixture from the heat stir in the peanut butter and vanilla first until it is smooth then stir in the coconut and oatmeal. I used cookie sheets lined with waxed paper; actually I ran out of waxed paper for the second pan and substituted foil to cover half of it and it worked just as well--the cookies came right off after they were set. I doubled the recipe and used a tablespoon to form adequate-sized cookies for three hungry guys and I came out with approximately 4 dozen.",
