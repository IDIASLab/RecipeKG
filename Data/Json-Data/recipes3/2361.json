I made this again with all Splenda instead of sugar and it turned out great. This time instead of vanilla I subbed chocolate Torani syrup. YUM! More chocolately!",

With that said they're good in and of themselves... they're like a mixture between pudding and cake. I bet they'd be perfect for an ice cream sandwich (traditional cookies get too hard when they hit the ice cream). I only used 1 3/4 cups sugar and they were very sweet. I might try reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and reducing the cocoa slightly. Make sure you use good tofu (I used Morinu) because its flavor will come through.",

I'm more of a cakey person though I don't tend to like soft things like pudding or mousse so if you do this is a must try!:) It is definitely not a rich brownie - there is no cake texture and it's too soft:) The batter did spread out really thin b/c it's so soft like another reviewer said - next time I'll probably bake in a smaller pan or maybe add some baking powder. I think my bf will love this b/c he's the opposite of me and loves soft things!:) And I didn't have safflower oil so I used \"I can't believe it's butter\" and I used white flour instead of whole wheat and a mixture of light and dark brown sugar in place of the unrefined sugar and Irish Cream liqueur instead of the instant coffee powder and I added some caramel sauce. I might try again with whole wheat flour that could give it an interesting taste. I might incorporate tofu into my regular brownie recipe:)",
