When I bite into a soft buttery bagel with just the perfect crunch and flake, with an explosion of maple syrup it is a treat, let me tell you. With the ham being browned, it brings out all the flavors. Nothing is better than the hot melted cheese and warm soft yolk. In addition, all of these flavors together bring me back to when my Grandma would make a big family breakfast, and now I have it all in a simple bagel!",
