The apple stuffing was fantastic. I didn't peel the apples and the skins weren't even noticeable when the stuffing was cooked. I also added some poultry seasoning and celery leaves, chopped, to the stuffing before cooking. The leaves added more celery flavor and looks pretty too. I too had extra stuffing after stuffing the duck, so I put the extra in a baking dish and dotted with butter and baked for 30 min. at 350. Before I took the stuffing out of the oven, I left the stuffing on the middle rack of the oven and turned the broiler on to give the stuffing some crunchy bits. Careful not to burn. Great recipe. Thanks.",

The stuffing was pretty tasty but I thought the duck itself needed more flavor to cover up the game taste a bit - yes I know duck by definition should taste game-y but a nice sauce or more seasoning to the flesh itself could have worked with it and improved on it. I think my next foray into duck I will try to do the classic duck a la orange or maybe the version of Peking Duck that is on the website.",

Also a lot of cooks say duck legs and breasts deserve different treatment and I concur. This was my first duck and I loved how the breast meat came out but not the legs so much. The stuffing is terrific and I followed the recipe faithfully using a homemade corn bread recipe from a cajun cookbook and mositened with some homemade chicken stock on hand. If I do this again I may just go with breasts alone and cook the dressing separately.",
