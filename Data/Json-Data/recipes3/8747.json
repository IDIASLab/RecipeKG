        "description": "Nasi goreng is basically fried rice for anyone living in a Southeast Asia island. There are so many different types that no one really knows them all (or maybe someone does, but that poor soul has way too much time on his hands). This is the most basic recipe that you can have that still makes something resembling nasi goreng. You can add other ingredients, such as peas, sweet red peppers, shallots, spinach, chicken, shrimp, beef, bean sprouts, or anything else you feel like adding, but you'll have to experiment on your own for those.",
