In a way that only those who are brought up together can get away with, she was told that he never likes anything that she brings. He then relented and said she could bring the cornbread. After a bit of experimenting, this is what we came up with. Everyone at the party agreed that this cornbread was awesome, and much better than any cornbread Justin ever made. Gotta love sibling rivalries.",
