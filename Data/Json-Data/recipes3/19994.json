To keep the bottom crust from being soggy I pierced it with a fork several times and baked it in the oven a few minutes before adding the filling.

Easy to do, easy to tweak to your liking...I took some shortcuts...I used perdue shortcuts chicken...used frozen broccoli florets and chopped up...used bagged baby carrots I steamed and chopped...cream of chicken w/herbs (as another reviewer did, great idea) tossed in half a can of diced new potatoes...used store brand pie crust...and after filling crust put one more layer of shredded cheddar before putting on the top crust.\nIt came out phenomenal! Even better today than last night when it was fresh...my first pot pie and hubby and baby girl LOVED it! Thanks for the great recipe!",

Also I used pre-cooked chicken strips. Then I topped it off with 1/2 cup of bisquick mixed with one egg and 2 tbs of water. It's beautiful!",
