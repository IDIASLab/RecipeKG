The ginger is a nice touch and I love the combination of fruits and the crunch from the walnuts. I used Hellman's light mayo that I cut with a little light sour cream to give it the dressing even more creaminess and the honey gave it just the right amount of sweetness. This would be equally good with craisins or pecans. Great by itself but really good on whole grain bread! Thanks for a great recipe!",
