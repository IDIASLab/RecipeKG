I did like the beer in it and will probably work that into my favorite Chili recipe, but I won't make this one again.",

I added a decent amount of Franks Red Hot. Also added 1 Habenero 1 Red Chili in addition to the current pepper order. WIth the meats I also did seperatly. My sausage weight was around 2.5lbs and 2lbs of beef. sausage i removed the skin and pan fried then ran through the food processor for a more even texture. I boiled the beef and ran through the food processor as well. Only other thing was more chili pepper was needed in my opinion but the recipe is a good starting area:) like any recipe season to taste. Hope you all enjoy this recipe as well",
