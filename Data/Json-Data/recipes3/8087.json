I added 1/4 tsp of marjoram (dried) and did a puff pastery crust 400' oven for about 20mins. Will definetly make this again. Little idea make the mix and put in a ziplock container or baggy and freeze it. have puff pastery on hand and when your ready defrost it and assemble. Happy cooking!",

Otherwise everything else was followed to a T. I even got to finally use my homemade chicken broth that I'd been dying to try! I was skeptical at first that the sauce was too runny but it turned out to be perfect later. This was downright DELICIOUS. So satisfying yummy homemade and worth every effort and it's still easy! My boyfriend and I devoured half of the contents of the 9x13 pan in the first sitting. The rest made for awesome leftovers.",
