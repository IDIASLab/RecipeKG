Once I finished browning the chicken, I took all the chicken out. I then added 1/2 of a chopped onion, 4 cloves chopped garlic, and sauteed for 2-3 minutes. I then added 2 different types of mushrooms, shitake and button, all sliced (we like a lot of mushrooms).  After a couple of minutes, I added about a cup of white wine, and let that simmer to burn off any alcohol. Then, I added 1/2 and 1/2, and about a cup and 1/2 of chicken broth. At this point, I also added in the dijon mustard. To  make the sauce thicker (because I didn't use the heavy cream), I added a slurry to the sauce. I then poured the sauce on top of the chicken and put it in the oven on 350 for about 15 minutes. My husband said \"We need to add this into the rotation!\" YUM!",

I increased the amount to 4 servings and it asked for 1/2 pound of green onions which is a lot of onions and a full 6 cups of heavy whipping cream which is way too much whipping cream. In fact all I used was a pint and I thought that was a little too much. This is a delicious recipe but not written for a beginner which is a shame because it is actually very easy to make but only if you already know by looking at the recipe that the measurements are all wrong.
