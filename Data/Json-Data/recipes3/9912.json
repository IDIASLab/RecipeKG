                "reviewBody": "Yummy.  This is so good!  I decided before starting the recipe that I wouldn't cook the pork in the oven, for a couple of reasons.  First, pork tenderloin is a premium cut and really doesn't require cooking in the oven, shredding, and simmering for twenty minutes to be tender.  Second, it's too darn hot to use the oven!  I did as reviewer Cabinluvn did:  cut the pork into strips.  Cooked until no longer pink, then proceeded with the recipe.  Ran out of hoisin so supplemented with bottled stir-fry sauce.  I also cut back a bit on the cornstarch; the ratio of cornstarch to liquid seemed a little high since the hoisin is already thick.  Used multigrain wraps.  We really enjoyed this and will likely have it often.  I feel that this is a healthy dish except for the sodium; not sure how to address that!  PS:  Used ground ginger; if I had used fresh, I would have cut it back.",
