I used a 4# bag of boneless skinless thighs so easy and less fat. I added all the 5 link pack of sweet Italian sausage just because I didn't want to freeze the two left over. I like lots of sauce so I added two cans of diced Italian tomatoes instead of one. I think it's very important to add that after you brown the chicken and the sausage when you add the liquids you need to scrape the browned bits off the bottom of the pot while you stir. I don't care for rosemary so added dried thyme in it's place. Also after simmering 25 minutes I uncovered skimmed off the fat and simmered another 30 minutes uncovered till the chicken was tender but not mush. I also doubled the mushrooms just because we all love mushrooms in my family. When it was done I added a slurry of 1 Tbl. cornstarch in 1/4 C. cold water and added while stirring the pot. This gave it a thick smooth consistency which stuck to the egg noodles very nicely. My husband and sons raved! I will be making this for company or family get togethers for sure. Thank you soooooooooo much on your very different but delicious twist on Coq au Vin!!!!",

My husband thought it was excellent and could not stop talking about it all night. Served in a bowl with some crusty French bread to mop up the sauce. The flavors were incredible. Recipe was easy to prepare. This was a perfect fall dish. Next time I am going to add more Italian sausage. (I used scissors to cut each link into slices). Left the skins on so there was a little bit of oiliness but my husband liked it that way and think the skin added to the rich flavor of the dish.",

I did not flour and precook the chicken...I just added all raw ingredients plus the wine into my crockpot and turned on high for 3 hours. When the chicken was done I made a roux of flour and water and whisked it into the crockpot. Just prior to serving I mixed in 1/3 cup of parmesean cheese. Served over mashed potatoes.

It is easy and if there were ever any left it would make great leftovers. I use boneless skinless chicken thighs and cook much longer than the recipe calls for probably another hour or so. That way the meat absolutely falls apart and the sauce really soaks into it. I usually omit the carrots to help lower the carbs. For my husband who doesn't have to watch his carbs I serve over rice. Great job richard Thanks for our family staple.",

I split this into 2 pans on the stove-top and used 1 can of tomatoes (which I used diced tomatoes opposed to the whole ones) to each pan but forget to double the already prepared ingredients (didn't know I was going to wind up using 2 cans). Next time when I make it this way I will leave the carrots out completely (personal preference) add extra mushrooms onion and garlic and add some sliced zuccini and maybe some sliced black olive for color. When the chicken was done I removed the chicken and sausage from the pan and added a little flour/water mixture to thicken the sauce up. Served this with pasta (smothered in the sauce from the chicken of course!) and stuffed artichokes! The whole family went crazy!!",
