I used one large boneless skinless chicken breast, pounded slightly and cut in half.  I used more carrot, peppers (red and yellow) and mushrooms than called for and a large clove of garlic.  I used one can of diced tomatoes already flavored with oregano, garlic and basil, so I cut the Italian seasoning to 1 teaspoon.  I first browned the chicken in a skillet with a little olive oil and placed it in the bottom of the slow cooker.  I then deglazed the skillet with the tomatoes and their juice.  I combined all the other ingredients (except the pasta) with the tomatoes and poured everything on top of the chicken in the slow cooker.  My chicken was done in just four hours.  The only problem was the carrots weren\u2019t quite as tender as I\u2019d have liked, so next time I will substitute orange bell peppers and leave the carrots out all together.  I did thicken this up a bit with a corn starch/water slurry.  Rather than pasta, I served this over rice.  I will do this one again.  Hubs will be happy, because he loved it.",

I doubled the amount of garlic which gave it a rich Italian flavor. I also added a teaspoon of sugar to cut the acid in the tomatoes. I checked the chicken temperature at the 5 hour mark , the chicken was done so I turned off the crock pot and the chicken was perfectly moist. I served it over spaghetti squash for a low carb meal. I will definitely make this again!",

I've made this in a skillet and in a crockpot and the skillet version is WAY better. Browning the chicken seasoned with salt and pepper (and breading the chicken would be good too) and adding more seasoning along the way in the skillet adds more flavor compared to the instructions in the current recipe. The recipe was bland for me in the crockpot. I'm not a fan of using a lot of salt in my dishes however this needed it to intensify the flavor. The vegetables and canned tomatoes paired well with the chicken. In my opinion, this recipe could be 5 stars if it's cooked in a skillet for a shorter length of time (~ simmering for 30 min) and more seasoning was added throughout the cook time (e.g. garlic powder, oregano, paprika to the chicken before browning).",
