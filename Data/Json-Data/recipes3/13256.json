This recipe can also be infinitely modified by substituting different meats or veggies. Just make sure the meats are pre-cooked and the veggies are cut small enough to cook thoroughly within the 25 minute time frame.",

They are very easy to customize to personal tastes with different veggies and spices. I made them exactly as written and barely had enough mixture to make 12. You'd be better off making 10. They are very small (about 1\" thick) and ended up with concave bottoms (?) so even smaller than they appeared before taking the cupcake liners off...which by the way are quite difficult to get off because the eggs stick to them. I would make them in silicon or greased cupcake pans next time.",
