Rather than cooking the shrimp first then removing it and setting it aside, I just drizzled some olive oil and butter in the pan, cooked the tomatoes and garlic briefly, then added the shrimp to the luxurious sauce awaiting it in the pan, cooking just until pink and opaque.  Serving this with zucchini ribbons instead of pasta made this a healthier, low-carb option.  Five stars all around \u2013 for simple, delicious flavor with few ingredients (usually the way that goes!) and ease of preparation.  Dinner (or in my case, lunch) served in just a few minutes \u2013 and with ingredients I nearly always have on hand.",
