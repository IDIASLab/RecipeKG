I was expecting something similar to a port i.e. a smokey deep flavor. But this liquor has a very light smooth flavor. There is no \"bite\" from the vodka. And the cloves give it a very interesting depth to its flavor. It almost tastes like it was aged in an oak barrel. All-in-all I give this 4/5 stars but I'm hoping that as the liquor sits in my decantur that the flavor will continue to develop. I will review this recipe again in another month or two and I hope to add the fifth star.",

A nice smooth liquor. My family and friends requested I make this every year for New Years. I used the 2:1 ratio in cocktails.",

It was very easy to make, and it turned out to be delicious!  I was worried because I used a cheaper brand of vodka, but even with that it tastes good (I'm sure the more expensive ones taste better, but I was pleasantly surprised with my cheap version).  I added some almond extract to the simple syrup after it cooled (I boiled 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of water for 15 minutes).  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

I bottled it in pretty bottles and gave away for Xmas gifts.  I asked my friends which they preferred and all agreed the less sweet version won out.   I agree.
