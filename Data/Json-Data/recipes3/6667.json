I used sour cream instead of the heavy cream...1. to make it thicker and 2. that is what I had on hand. Best served chilled we thought. I think I will use a whole bunch of cilantro next time. But great as is. Served with Chipotle Shrimp Tacos from this site. Huge hit with both my son and myself. Plan to use leftovers for other meats...maybe chicken tomorrow. Thanks Luci!!",

I hate using cream for anything so I decided I had to sub half and half for it. Of course it came out rather thin so I took an extra step and threw everything in a saucepan added 1 tbsp of cornstarch dissolved in a little water. It thickened beautifully and it was still awesome!",
