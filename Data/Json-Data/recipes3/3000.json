The only difference is we add sugar (approx. 1 teas. for every couple of tablespoons of vinegar). I slice the cucumbers very thin using my mandoline slicer and then add the sour cream vinegar sugar s&p and mix it all together. The addition of dill sounds great! I'll have to try it next time I make this. My husband loves this served over mashed potatos.",
