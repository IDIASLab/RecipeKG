I used sour cream instead of cottage cheese made it a little more runny but it was still excellent.  I also added some seasonings to the meat such as liquid smoke...gave it a more smoked flavor!  Overall a phenomenal meal and fairly quick to make",

Didn't plan ahead too well before I thawed out the elk, though. I was low on cottage cheese, so used half cottage cheese and half sour cream. It had to cook a little longer than suggested, but it worked fine. Also was out of tomatoes, so I scattered a handful of halved grape tomatoes on top. I'll admit the meal looks kind of gloppy when served out onto the plate, but it was certainly yummy. Both my teen-aged kids gave it a thumbs up, too!",

I did add garlic salt to the venison as it was browning(my preference) and when I put it in the casserole dish I added some rosemary thyme and a little bit of dill seed. With these changes I would give it five stars. This recipe is very versatile and is an excellent base in which to start from. Thanks",

I had most of the ingredients for the Hunter's Venison Casserole so made that tonight with a few changes: 1) No cottage Cheese. I subbed 1 extra egg and 1/2 cup organic thick yogurt (MINE DID NOT TURN OUT RUNNY!!) 2) No bell pepper. Extra carrots. 3) Added hot pepper flakes & cayanne 4) Left the skin on my smashed redskins and used probably 2.5 c 5) No shredded cheese - used 1/2 c grated Parmesan 6) Bake time - baked an extra 10 min (30 total) as I baked it in a Le Cruset. Delicious easy. Will make again!",
