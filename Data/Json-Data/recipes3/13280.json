The first batch was  too hard to eat even though I heard them pop. They smell wonderfully nutty but stay rock hard and then begin to burn. For the second batch, I reduced the temperature slightly and allowed them to cook a bit longer so they wouldn't burn. They were a bit better, but still hurt my teeth they were so hard. I used green Puy lentils. I ended up boiling them afterwards and ate them in a soup.",

A few notes: - The recipe didn't mention that lentils need to be immersed in water the night before to allow them to soften. - I took the advice of the first reviewer and heated them on a low temperature for a longer time. - They sizzle as they are cooking. Mine are getting crispy! I used 3 dried chili peppers since that's what I had on hand.",
