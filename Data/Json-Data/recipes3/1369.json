I tried a couple others on the site and thought that they had way too much vodka. I like that this only had 1 Tblsp. After reading the reviews I mixed up the kind of creamer to buy. I bought the vanilla caramel creamer and it worked fine. I could also only find vanilla vodka and went with that. I also really liked that this one called for just dipping the rim of the glass into chocolate. I put a circle onto a disposable plate and dipped the top into it. Other ones called for drizzling it around the glass and I found that to be messy. Just on the rim was elegant and just the right amount. I didn't have a shaker so I just used a tall container with a twist on cap shook it with ice and then strained it with the lid. Try this one and you won't need to try the others! Ty",
