I didnt have any fresh herbs so I used dried.  we added baking powder to the dough.  when we form them into patties we put a tiny bit of water on the outside while forming them, add the sesame seeds then deep fry them. no issues of falling apart. I even brushed a couple with a small amount of olive oil and baked them, they turned out wonderful.   reminds my Egyptian husband of home.  thank you for this recipe!",

The mixture came together beautifully and held together great until I put them in the oil. They never really crisped up and they began falling apart. Still tasted great though. I'm gonna try to figure out how to keep them together better next time b/c they are definitely worth trying again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I read on another site that you CANNOT use canned or cooked chickpeas(which I did) and you should stick it in the fridge again for about an hour before cooking so that answers that. I gave it 3 stars because I feel that's an important note left out and even though it tasted good it wasn't great. I'll try again though to make it better.",
