The vinegar based hot sauce leaves you a lot of room for personal preference as I found many sauces at the store with varying degrees of hotness. I used a State Fair Salamida Spiedie Sauce. I also had to use 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce because I only had 1/2 cup worcestershire sauce. This one is definitely worth repeating!!!!!!",
