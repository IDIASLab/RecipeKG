I did not squeeze the grated potatoes. The potatoes juices pooled at the bottom of the mixing bowl. I used a 1/3 cup measuring cup. This recipe gave me 8 uniformed patties. Fried for approximately 4 mins. each side. Terrific with our beef polska keilbasa and saurkraut. Don't forget the homemade applesauce and sour cream!",

I also only used about 1 thick slice of onion and that was enough. These turned out quite delicious with sour cream and bacon bits. Be warned though: don't prepare this too far in advance as the potatoes will start to brown. It still tastes fine (at least to me) but it looks a little less yummy. Thanks for sharing Basg!",

I let the potato/onion mixture sit in a colander and I push the liquid out.  Than i let the potatoe water sit for 5 minutes so it becomes sediment (potato starch) and I add that to the mix as well.
