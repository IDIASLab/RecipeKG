This recipe is simply incredible. I am a garlic lover and have been in heaven for the three weeks since I discovered this recipe. I personally recommend Romainian feta if you can find it. I get it at a cheese speciality shop its a little creamier and cheaper. I also add two cubes of frozen dill weed available at most grocery stores. The first time I made this I used 8 cloves of garlic after all I have a very high threshold. That was tooooo much even for me although I ate it all! I am good at four cloves. The processor seems to magnify the garlic taste as does letting it sit overnight. I started with the \"pulsing\" mode in the processor but I like the smooth texture so now I use the \"high\" position. This is the perfect compliment to the \"pork souvlaki\" recipe on this sight (substitued with chicken breast though). I have now completed my search for the perfect chicken-souvlaki with tzatiki combo and I don't care about authenticity.",

I made it as is (minus the blender)and it was delicious. I used it as a marinade for boneless skinless chicken breasts and drumsticks for the kids. I baked the chicken and put it under the broiler for the last couple of minutes to improve the colour it was delicious. I reserved some to use as dip with pita with the supper and topped the whole meal off with greek salad. What a meal! The kids and I finished the chicken and the dip off today with pita sandwiches this is a keeper. I'm giving it a 5 star for it's taste easiness and versatility!",
