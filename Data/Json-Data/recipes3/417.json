But I have made this frosting many times already as a filling for the Williamsburg Orange Cake (also from this website) and as a frosting for cupcakes (same cake recipe). As a filling it is great. Used as a frosting for a cake or cupcakes I find it a bit soft. Perhaps it has to do with my hot and humid tropical climate - I live in Malaysia. But I will continue to use it because it smells and tastes great and it's refreshingly different from the usual buttercream frosting. I just put the cake with the frosting in the fridge to set overnight before taking it anywhere.",

The half cup of softened butter will take all that sugar perfectly well but you MUST let it keep going! It'll be a complete crumbly mess for a good while and then suddenly it will all come together. At that point add your three tablespoons of liquid and it will be perfectly spreadable. For added fluff and spread use a whip attachment in a stand mixer and whip it for a few minutes. I used Grand Marnier in my frosting and it was to die for! Better than when my mom made it when I was little though of course the liqueur makes all the difference.",
