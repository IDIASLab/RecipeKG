Personally I would leave out the savory next time this herb is way too strong for chicken. I may try this again but will definately adjust the herbs and spices more to our liking. Spice mixture will also stick to chicken better if you dip in plain flour then egg then spice mixture. I also double dipped in egg and spice mixture.",

This is a Spice Mix FOR chicken the recipe author DIDN'T state it was KFC's spice mix for chicken. Most reviewers are taste comparing this with a fast food chain's flavors instead of basing their reviews on the flavor itself to chicken. The taste was pretty good. It bumped up a regular fried chicken recipe. I made it exactly as directed for my first batch. With my second batch I added a little bit of poultry seasoning sage onion powder marjoram corriander and cumin. I'm giving 4 stars to the recipe because of the process of double cooking. I would prefer to do it once and be done not add extra steps.",
