Tomato and celery along with some other ingredients are sauteed in oil and then simmered in tomato juice. It's a quick fix when you have no salsa. Warm tortilla chips go well with this salsa. Just pop some chips in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes until lightly browned.",

I didn't add any flour to it and pureed 2-3 tomatoes in the blender...so very healthy very quick..very very tasty. My DD likes raw celery and I thought this was easier to eat but she still prefers it raw and didn't care a whole lot for salsa..but my neighbour and her 4 year old loved this. Thank you for this quick tasty recipe!",

I omitted the flour since the diced tomatoes were still thick enough to make this a good chunky salsa. I also added a pinch of dill weed. However the next day it began to lose it's flavor so I can imagine it doesn't keep very well in the fridge. Not a bad salsa substitute thanks.",

The only caution I have is that I added hot pepper sauce to suit my taste while it was cooking which was perfect but when it cooled and the sauce soaked in more it got a little spicier so I'd add slightly less than you think you actually need. Still yum though. Hubby didn't like it as much--thought it was too sweet.",
