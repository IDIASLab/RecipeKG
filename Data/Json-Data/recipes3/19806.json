I also use the whole block of cream cheese. Instead of romano cheese I use about a cup of mozzarella and about half a cup of grated parm. cheese on top. I love garlic so i usually add about a teaspoon of minced garlic. Throw the artichokes, cream cheese and spinach in the blender to make it less lumpy. I serve this with chips or with carrot and celery sticks. Enjoy!",

I use equal parts mayo (light is fine) and sour cream, no cream cheese. Also, a little fresh lemon juice and some extra garlic help give it some flavor. And finally...I think for any restaurant-quality spinach artichoke dip, monterrey jack cheese is a MUST! I use about 1 cup - half mixed into the dip and the other half baked on top (cover with foil while baking to prevent rubbery cheese). Oh, and I always serve with blue corn tortilla chips and a side of salsa and sour cream. All in all, this is a great and easy recipe to have on hand!",

It was very dry & hard - we were trying to use it for a dip for chips.  The chips broke off in it.  Maybe it is more meant for breads, but we were expecting a creamy dip for chips (like in nice restaurants).  Instead we ended up with a hard spread-type dish.  We will not be trying this again unless we come up with a way to make it creamy.  Sorry!",

I followed the recipe exactly as stated and served it right out of the oven.  I thought it tasted best hot and when it cooled down it actually didn't taste too good.  I served this dip at a party and had a ton of leftovers, so it didn't go over too well with my guests... I'm going to keep on looking for that TJI Friday's look alike!",

I made a huge batch for a small get together I was hosting (a whole 9x13 in pan!) and it was GONE in no time flat! I did make one big change to the recipe; I cut out the Romano cheese and added about 1- 1.5 cups of Monterey Jack instead because I really wanted this dip to have that cheesy texture and the Monterey Jack is mild enough and has enough moisture to be in my opinion the perfect 'dip' addition. I also took the liberty of adding a bit more garlic but that's a personal preference. Great recipe- thanks!",
