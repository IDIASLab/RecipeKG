Not to worry once you mix it into the sauce it ends looking very good. Like this and would make again.",

And I had a bottle of Katsu sauce in the refrigerator. So I used Katsu (no soy sauce and no honey because the Katsu is sweet) juice of an orange garlic powder and lots of freshly grated ginger and the cornstarch. I really loved this sauce. The second go-round I added carrots turnips onions and yellow bell pepper--and served on rice.",
