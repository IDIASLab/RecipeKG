                "reviewBody": "This turned out surprisingly good even though it is truly geared to someone with a big sweet tooth. I thought the white chocolate would be too much but well-blended it's not. Had to substitute for the candied cherries half the amount of dried sweetened cranberries and chunks of semi-sweet chocolate for the morsels. I was a little unsure of the directions so did what I've done with Rice Krispy Treats - I placed the mixture in a well-oiled one-cup funnel to make \"kisses\". It makes exactly four. They hardened at room temperature at which point I could wrap them in cellophane and tie with a ribbon. I may try this recipe with all the ingredients except the white chocolate and according to the recipe for Rice Krispy Treats but I will certainly make this one again as it is written! The only trouble I had was with melting the white chocolate. I used the microwave and perhaps this was the problem? Even though the chocolate got a little dry and wouldn't pour I could mix it into the other ingredients by hand.",
