I pan-fried the breasts in olive oil for 5-6 minutes on each side, until juices ran clear.  I removed the breasts and sauteed 1/2 lb fresh sliced mushrooms and 4 shallots, adding 1/3 cup low sodium chicken broth when they had suitably cooked.  I mixed 2 teaspoons of cornstarch with 1/2 cup lowfat milk until smooth.  When the mushroom/broth mixture boiled, I added the cornstarch mixture with a pinch of Herbes de Provence and stirred for 2-3 minutes until thickened.  Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve!  Amazing!",

Like the others I strained the marinade and boiled it for a good ten minutes then skimmed it. To this I added about 1/4 tsp of low sodium chicken granules parsley and a slurry to go over the chicken. The next time I will add the the chicken to the wine reduction for a few minutes. I served this with rice mushroom and shallots that I sauted in a little avocado oil. Thanks for the recipe shark77 I will be making this again.",

They were big boobs even after I flattened them. I also strained and reserved the marinade boiled for 10 minutes and added a weak corn starch slurry to thicken it slightly. Served over the chicken before serving and it was delish! Used the herb recipe from this site http://allrecipes.com/recipe/herbs-de-provence/detail.aspx. This tastes a bit like chicken piccata.
