The mixture is all things that I have on hand the prep takes just a few minutes and it's quick to cook. I make some rice and put it in the micro just before I start cooking the chicken and everything is ready at the same time (with a salad or other veg). I use a mixture of butter (not margarine) with the olive oil to fry the pieces as I prefer the flavor of butter. I also add some half and half or cream to the drippings in the pan to make a light sauce (or add more liquid and thicken it a bit with flour). Excellent main dish nice enough for company.",
