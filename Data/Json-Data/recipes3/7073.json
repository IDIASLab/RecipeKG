I had no \"spiced\" tomatoes so I used canned diced tomatoes and sauted 3 cloves of garlic, 1 small onion finely chopped, and 1 small red pepper diced.  I added the saute mixture to the tomatoes and put ove r the Boursin mixture.  To all who want to save calories, spray baking dish with Pam and use a light herbed cream cheese (\nBoursin is not necessary)!!! Will add to my regular rotation!",

Because this dish had Boursin cheese in it, which Hubs hates but agreed to tolerate for me, I deliberately made a hearty pasta dish to go with, thinking that this fish dish was going to be a total bust. Wow, what a surprise - for both of us.  Best fish recipe I've made in awhile.  I had fresh tomatoes and peppers from my garden so I used them in place of the canned tomatoes.  I sauteed some shallots and finely chopped green pepper, added some fresh minced garlic, then cooked that a bit before adding the fresh, diced tomatoes.  Since Hubs was so cooperative with the Boursin, I deliberately skipped the Parmesan, which he REALLY dislikes.  I didn't miss it.  The fish was flaky, tender and moist; the sauce to die for.  This was so good even Boursin Hating Hubs loved it! Served with Penne with Garlicky Broccolini, also from this site, this was just an excellent meal.",
