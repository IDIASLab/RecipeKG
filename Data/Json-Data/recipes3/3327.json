Although not one I'd serve over pasta often I can imagine how good it would be as a sauce for baked chicken and the like. A few changes that I made: I used about a dozen fresh tomatoes instead of canned omitted the parsley and added tarragon basil & a bay leaf. I also salted and peppered to taste and added a few teaspoons of tomato paste for more of a tomato flavor.",

And hey why not add a grated zucchine too? The secret is to blend everything or pass it through a vegetable strainer before serving. I made a double portion in a slow cooker for 3 hours on high adding some fresh basil in the end before storing in airtight containers in the fridge. Thank you The Iron Chef Suzi-Q for this wonderful recipe.",
