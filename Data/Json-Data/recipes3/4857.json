Instead of stuffing mix I used Farm to Market Grains Galore bread which I cubed and toasted in the oven. I used walnuts almonds and pine nuts; no pistachios or macadamias. I also doubled the amount of sausage and used fresh sage instead of dried sage. We enjoyed it with our Thanksgiving dinner but it was much much better the following day. I'll make it again next year but I recommend making it a day ahead of time.",
