A bit labor intensive for a pasta dish (it really did take me a good solid hour) but the result is good so no complaints. It could use a little more cheese flavor. I used sharp cheddar and it still wasn't particularly strong. This time I used a nice hoppy amber ale...and I think the hops were a little too much. I'm a big hophead so it was ok for me but I imagine a lot of people wouldn't like the bitterness. A nice stout or porter would probably be a safe bet for this recipe. Overall not quite as good as what I got at Stone but tasty for sure. There's a lot of variations you can do with this recipe so it's a good place to start.",

Yet this recipe intrigued me and I took a risk and made it anyway (come on cheese bacon beer pretzels?!). As written it's a little bland (I more than doubled the garlic and couldn't taste it!) but with a few minor tweaks could be my second favorite mac & cheese (nothing's going to top our recipe!). I'd rec increasing both the garlic and the bacon significantly (the bacon taste was almost undetectable sadly) and adding a dash of dry mustard as well as the wet mustard. I'd also rec using a variety of flavorful cheeses. I also found I needed to cook my roux a lot longer to get it to thicken up so don't start boiling your noodles until the white sauce has begun to simmer. This is def worth giving a try!",

The beer is a nice touch it just needed more cheese. I tripled the cheese. My kids don't care for celery so I doubled the carrot and used a whole package of matchstick carrots. I sprinkled more cheese on top before adding the pretzel mixture. Smells great I hope it meets my family's macaroni and cheese expectations. EDITED: This was interesting. My littlest wouldn't eat it and my eldest ate it with reservations. I can't wait to see what my husband says. I thought it was edible just not something I'd make again. Sorry. I really wanted this to work out.",
