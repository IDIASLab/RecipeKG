It takes a lot of ingredients and some effort but is definitely worth the try. All the ingredients can be found in an Indian grocery store very easily, and they are not expensive either.

It's quite tasty and not intimidating as it looks to prepare. i was able to find most of the ingredients at my local grocery store although I didn have to hunt around for the curry leaf. I did slightly reduce the quantity of mint leaves however because I thought half a bunch seemed like it might be a lot and as a matter of personal preference I prefer a more subtle mint flavor anytime I use mint in cooking.",

This was good and we enjoyed it but I've made less labor-intensive curries that have been just as good. Also take care to remove the cinnamon stick cardamom pods and cloves before serving - biting into them unawares is not pleasant.",
