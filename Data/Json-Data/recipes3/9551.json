The first thing I did was cook the leeks in 1/2 cup of butter salt and pepper instead of oil. I then added the potatoes to the leeks and added the broth. Brought that to an oil until the potatoes were soft. Then I added the 1 cup of Heavy Cream. Salt and pepper to taste. I used bacon instead of ham. I did blend the soup and added the bacon on top. SOOOO GOOD! No shortage of flavor here!",

What I found though (because I made it twice) is that you want to add it the last hour that it is cooking. That way it will give it enough time to thicken up. The roux I made separate and added in. I did it once right before serving and it was still soupy. The next time I did the roux I put it in about an hour before it was done and it was nice and creamy thick. I love this recipe perfect for those cold winter days.",
