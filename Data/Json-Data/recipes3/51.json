I increased the milk to 1 cup and it was definitely not too much. I also used Italian style bread crumbs and added the leftover bread crumb/cheese mixture to the gravy to make a wonderful savory sauce that thickened nicely and just turned out fabulous. I used fresh portabello mushrooms as well. Do NOT hesitate to make this recipe but do add the extra milk or you will be sad that you do not have enough gravy! Oh I forgot to mention that I added about 1/4 cup of red wine to the sauce for another dimension of flavor. Yum!",
