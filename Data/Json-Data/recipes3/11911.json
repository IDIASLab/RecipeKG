The main problem with both recipes as written is the usual danger with Indian food the spices went in raw and stayed that way. They needed a gentle browning to really meld and permeate the dishes especially the potatoes and peas. And I m not sure where you could ve done that as the instructions are written. I used milk because I was not trying for vegan.",
