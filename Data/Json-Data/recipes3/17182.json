I started with dried minced onions and jarred minced garlic added the broth and then a can of pumpkin puree. We let that get all happy then added WAY more peanut butter than the recipe called for...more like 1/2 a cup. We omitted the red pepper flakes but did add some tabasco. We also used evaporated milk in place of the cream and topped them with home made croutons...we cubed up some whole wheat bread sprinkled on some olive oil cinnamon and sugar and toasted them in the oven for a little bit. YUMMY!",

So much work it was worth it but will not do it in the future. I also put in a jalapeno and mushrooms extra curry extra cayenne pepper (instead of red flakes) milk (instead of cream because I didn't have any) and crunchy peanut butter. I only used two cups of broth ten cups is entirely too much. The cream adds enough fluid as well. I probably would not puree it so smoothly but more chunky instead. This soup was delicious and lived up to its expectations and will make it again. A fantastic Autumn soup.",
