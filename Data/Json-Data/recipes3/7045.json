Until I tried this one, that is!  This is perfect.  The tofu gives it that fluffier consistency I was missing with my close second favourite that involves flax seed as an egg replacer.  When I made this, I substituted honey for the sugar.   I should also add I thought i worked best to make in muffin cups instead of in a square baking pan. I loved it and have made it more than once!  Definitely a \"keeper.\"",

Sometimes vegan recipe makeovers don't taste anything like the original (that's not always a bad thing), and while you could tell there was something different, you could also right away identify it as corn bread. My tasters gave it the thumbs up. My one comment is that it was really dense. It didn't have the sponginess and softness of cornbread--almost more dumpling-like, with a pretty doughy texture even when cooked through. That aside, it was still very tasty and enjoyed by many.",

My teenage son has been strictly vegan for a few years and mentioned he'd really missed cornbread, so I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I've tried soooo many vegan recipes for foods that are meant to replicate non-vegan dishes and it's a hit or miss thing if you expect an exact match for taste and texture. This recipe is a home run! I added about 1/3 cup of creamed corn, used a muffin pan, and reduced the cook time to 18 minutes. This was better than the non-vegan cornbread recipes I've tried - and I've tried a lot. The taste was exceptional and the bread was fluffy and a little crumbly, which I love. Definitely sticking with this as my go-to cornbread!",

I figured the tofu was adding the binding, the moisture, that an egg would have added, so I substituted my favorite egg swap.  I used a heaping tablespoon of ground flax seed, then added warm water until it made 1/4 cup.  I stirred it then microwaved 18 seconds, then stirred it briskly.  It thickened up to be like an egg or like pureed soft tofu so I went ahead with confidence.  I made one other change.  I added a small amount of whole kernel corn (canned, drained) -- about 1/4 to 1/3 cup.  The bread was tasty.  It was less fluffy than I prefer and had less cornmeal, I think, than I prefer.  I will definitely make again (it is that good, and healthier for us) but next time will try a bit more corn meal and a bit less flour.  Also I may try substituting some of the flour with whole wheat flour for health reasons.",

We also wanted to make it more wholesome so I subbed in whole wheat flour for reg flour. Really tasty. I also didnt have soy milk one day so I just used water and worked ut amazing. Also have used rice milk and its a vreat alternative as well. So by trail and error we found this recipe w a few tweaks really works for us!
