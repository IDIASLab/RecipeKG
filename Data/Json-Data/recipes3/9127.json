One thing I failed to do was make individual Strombolis which I will section the dough out next time and do:)",

I had no idea where frozen dough was in my grocery store, so that took forever to find, but once I finally got it home, it was really easy to work with.  The only changes to the recipe I made were to add onion and garlic to the ground beef when cooking, besides that, I kept it exactly as detailed. Rolling the Stromboli was easy as I kept the ingredients in the middle and more folded over the dough, tucking one side underneath.  The moving of it to my baking sheet was little precarious. I somehow managed with two large spatulas and luck.  Also, make sure to cut vent holes on the top.  I'll definitely make this again!",

If you do as the instructions say and roll the dough into a 12x15 rectangle on a greased baking sheet it will be too thin and not stay together. Try putting it on wax paper and use that to roll it. With all the holes in it I could not bake it as a stromboli so I tried unrolling it to salvage it into a pizza.",
