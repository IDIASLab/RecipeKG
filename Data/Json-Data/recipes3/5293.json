Made a few alterations though: Feta cheese instead of mozzarella for a bigger taste Added some chicken sauteed in olive oil with some dried oregano sprinkled on Added some red pepper flakes Didn't even end up using the olives b/c was so good without but am sure the olives add a nice touch and imagine capers would as well. Actually this would be great with salmon and capers instead of chicken and olives...may try that next.",
