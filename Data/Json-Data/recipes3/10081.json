For example, I was out of pesto so I bullet blended a bunch of fresh basil and fresh garlic and olive oil.  Not exactly pesto but it did the job.  Also added some butter to cooked orzo for flavor and moisture. Eliminated red pepper (too overwhelming in taste) and red pepper flakes (I'm a spice wimp) but chopped some tomato and added at the end for color/moisture/flavor and because I still have a ton of tomatoes from my sisters garden.  Also cut up some fresh spinach and added to orzo to resemble something we love from Macaroni Grill.",
