I used fench cut beans, 1/2 sour cream instead of all milk, 1/2 cup chopped oinion, and a cup of cheddar cheese.  I did not mix any french fried onions in, as they tend to get soggy, I just topped with them (cheddar flavored) instead.  My husband who eats NO veggies, and everyone else too, had 2 seving each, our family of four almost polished off this whole casserole.  I am very excited, as I have been looking for a green bean casserole recipe, and this was so tasty.  Definitely cut down the liquid, or it will be too runny!",

I agree that you have to cut the full amount of milk since the beans will excrete some juices and make it a tad watery. My family prefers the string beans in the can whereas I prefer the green beans that are frozen from Sam's or Costco the large organic bag of beans. We also add some shredded colby jack to thicken it up a little more and a few chopped onions for added flavor. Be sure to 'cover' the top of your casserole with the French fried onions and bake till crispy... it's awesome!!!",
