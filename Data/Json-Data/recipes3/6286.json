These baked up beautifully in no time at all. The kitchen smelled wonderful which was an indicator that these would taste delicious. I opted to use half white Splenda and half brown sugar Splenda and added a generous splash of vanilla. I thew the apple in my mini-food processor vs. grating. You can easily sub nuts or dried cranberries for the raisins. Perfect with a piping hot cup of tea!",

I was a little concered because the wet ingredients had a rather lumpy texture but once the dry ingredients were added in the batter became nice and smooth. I ended up making 12 regular sized muffins instead of 36 mini muffins. I increased the baking time to 20 minutes and lowered the temp to 350. They were a bit more crumbly than I would have liked but still very good. If I make them again I will add some allspice as someone else suggested and more apple. I brought them to work and they were well received.",

I used Splenda brown sugar blend instead of the plain granulated sweetener. And to make the directions easier I just mixed all the dry ingredients together in one bowl. Then in a separate bowl I mixed together all the wet ingredients. Then I added the wet to the dry and mixed until well combined. I used mini cupcake liners and scooped the batter to the top of each with a melon baller. Then baked as stated. These had a nice fresh apple taste but I would decrease the amount of lemon zest next time to half. These muffins taste much better when they're cold! A very nice muffin recipe. Perfect with a cup of coffee or tea. Thanks Splenda!",
