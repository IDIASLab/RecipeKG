He only cooked two halibut steaks, and did the whole thing in the skillet, using probably 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Even though it was only two steaks, he used all of the other vegetables, all of the pepper instead of half, and cut the tomato into wedges instead of slices. When he served, he just ladled all of the vegetables over the steaks, and it presented beautifully. It was a wonderful dinner!",

I then used the marinade to saute' the veggies and poured all on the fish. It was delicious",

So with the red tomato it made a beautiful looking dish. I also had some fresh basil and lemon thyme growing so used that instead of the dried basil. With a side of rice (cooked in chicken stock and some chopped green onions stirred in afterward) it made a complete meal. The only down-side was that I didn't make enough!

I then added the veggies over the top and added a glug of white wine around the fish. I baked this covered for 15 minutes and then uncovered for 15 minutes (my halibut was a little larger than called for in the recipe).
