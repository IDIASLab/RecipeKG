The first time I planned to make it I could not find lobster, so I substituted steak (broil first till med. rare, dice, and add to sauce in the end). It was excellent.\n\nThe second time I did use lobster, and it is excellent both ways.\n\nI would like to offer my suggestions for an even more enjoyable taste experience.\n\nI used many more cloves of garlic called for, used extra buuter, and added fresh, chopped mushrooms.\n\nI did not use the amount of cinnamon called for, as only a hint is what it needed. Just maybe 1/2 a teaspoon.\n\nThe most important ingredient I added, and someone is bound to thank me for this, is Sherry (Marsala can also be used). About a 1/4 cup of this truly completes the taste. It makes all the difference.\n\nAlso, only a few dashes of salt is needed. The 2 t called for I believe is way too much.\n\nI also used a 28 oz sized can of Pureed Tomatoes, instead of diced, for a smoother sauce. \n\nCan top with freshly grated parmesean.\n\nI would love to read someone else's review who tried making this with the sherry, or substituting w/ a good cut of steak. I would hate to be the only one to savor this recipe with the additions.\n\nWonderful with a crusty bread and a caesar salad.",

They actually put it on their list of top 10 favorite meals! I was a bit skeptical as the recipe seemed so simple I thought it would be bland. But it was fantastic! I made a couple of changes: I used shallots instead of onions 1/2 diced tomatoes and 1/2 tomato sauce instead of all diced tomatoes and bow-tie pasta instead of spaghetti noodles. I really recommend the bow-tie pasta as it carries the sauce really well. Serve with crusty bread to sop up the sauce!",

I used half and half instead of cream and I sauted the onions and garlic in olive oil then added the tomatoes to that to avoid the extra fat. I used canned lobster to bring the cost down as well. Over all still tasty and a little more healthy so I didn't feel quite as bad about enjoying it. Better fresh the leftovers (at least my way) weren't the greatest.",

I was very excited to make this because it sounded delicious, the only thing that made me iffy was the cinnamon.  Just like I thought the cinnamon was way to overpowering and made it grossly sweet.  I was very disappointing since I spent a lot of money on this nice food, added extra garlic, extra onions,and mushrooms and sadly all I could taste was the cinnamon, I could barely taste the lobster.
