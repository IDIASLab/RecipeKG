Something in the ingredients is way off, so after reading the other reviews, I changed the recipe in the following ways: I used 3 cups of air-popped and then ground popcorn. I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the egg whites, as well as 1 tsp. of sugar. I baked them just as instructed. These cookies, while not \"the best!\" were pretty tasty! And with only 8 calories each, they are a simple, tasty dessert/snack. This is a fun recipe, and I hope that this review helps others to try and enjoy it as well!",

Mine weren't really sweet at all and the end result was more meringue than macaroon. I think they could be good with the right mixture of spices and possibly some vanilla or almond extract. I'll keep experimenting when I have leftover popcorn.",
