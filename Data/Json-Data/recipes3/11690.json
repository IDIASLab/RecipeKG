Instead of the cheese suggested I used shredded Parmesan yet not as much as they said. Just a sprinkle as I was trying to keep it lighter. This dish was truly amazing! Next time I would put the asparagus in at the halfway point because it was a bit mooshy but truly a delightful dish!! It's great paired with grilled chicken!",

I used Carrots for Parsnips sweet onion for Shallot green onion Turnips and Radishes and 2c. Chobani plain full milk yogurt 4 tbsp. milk and 1pkg.Stevia to get cream taste and consistency. I used 3 cheeses Muenster and Gouda slices on each layer and topped with shredded Mozzarella. For seasoning I used Cilantro and Chives as well as salt and pepper. It turned out great! I was a little worried about using these substitutions but all the flavors of the root vegetables and Cheeses melded together to make this creation based on this recipe. Thanks for the inspiration.",
