        "description": "This recipe is one that my cousin made up using her mother's basic recipe when we were teenagers. It tastes like pecan pie with ice cream. It became one of the family's favorites. Nowadays we use our stand mixer's nice attachment, the ice cream bowl - or on-the-counter ice cream makers - and it still comes out great. I mix this up of a morning or the night before I plan to make it. One reason for this was the longer it sets, the better the flavors blend into cream mixture, making a much better flavored ice cream and a faster freeze time.",

I made this in my counter-top ice cream maker and after the churn cycle it was still rather runny so I put it in the freezer to set. After 7 hours it still did not have a good ice cream consistency. I think we will probably be throwing the rest of this out because it's syrupy tasting and not creamy. I make ice cream quite often but this is one recipe I will not be using again sorry.",
