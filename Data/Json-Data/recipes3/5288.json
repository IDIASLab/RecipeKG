Cover and simmer on low heat while you prepare the rest of the recipe. (that probably takes about 15-20 minutes.) Lentils will be softened. Drain lentils and add to the tomato-bean pot and simmer for however long you have available but at least 15-20 minutes to blend flavors. I did the above plus added another can of beans (whatever you have-I had great northern beans) It came out great. The raisins were an excellent idea. I also accidently added 2 Tbsps of cumin. Still tasted great. Thanks.",

Also as a side note I use whole cumin seeds which I toast and grind in a spice mill... but ground cumin works just as well.",

Might consider adding coconut milk next time for a south Indian flare. BTW the grapes are not optional. If you don't have them around make a special trip. They are totally worth it. Try golden raisins instead of the plain black. A dollop of sour cream on top can cut the heat of the curry and makes it really tasty!",

I had to make some adjustments based on what I had on hand (did not use additional cumin used \"hot\" curry 1 14 oz can of roasted diced tomatoes and 1 14 oz can tomato sauce in place of crushed tomatoes) and also added mushrooms with the onions and garlic as well as a little veg stock/water to get to the consistency I wanted (and due to extended cook time). Served with chopped cilantro and a dollop of plain yogurt (didn't have sour cream). I also let it simmer longer than 1 hour and let sit for a couple of hours before serving. The taste became more mellow and sweeter over time. It was excellent and everyone loved it. I didn't have a problem with the lentils being undercooked because I let it simmer longer. I think the additional time improved the flavor. I definitely will make again. I might try different tomatoes or beans next time. Thanks for the recipe!",

I also pre-cooked the lentils in some chicken broth (I know that negated the vegetarian aspect of the dish but we're not vegetarian so I was okay with that). I added the lentils along with the residual broth (about 1-1/2 cups) to the rest of the ingredients and simmered for another 45 minutes. I served this over brown Jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth with a little butter mixed in. This recipe gets 5 stars for flavor but only 3 stars for preparation because the lentils really do need the pre-cooking and the extra liquid in order to be tender. Overall the recipe gets 4 stars and we will definitely be having this on a regular basis.",
