When I came home, I was determined to replicate that salad for family and friends.   This is a great green salad recipe because extra salad can marinate in the dressing overnight and be eaten the next day in pita pockets as a sandwich.",

My grandaughter is vegan and loved it and my grandson ate his (telling me all the way through how great it was) and ate the last half of mine because I am not a big eater. What is amazing is that my b-i-law who was a cook and only eats meat and potatoes and doesn't like salads ate the whole thing! The only thing I did different was hollow out big tomatoes and stuff them with the salad and put it in the fridge until dinner. Served on a salad plate with romaine lettuce beneath. They loved the presentation. I used Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House dressing from this site. TO DIE FOR!",

In Greece, instead of dressing  they often use just  olive oil and oregano but we always added a little red wine vinegar too.  You could also add a bit of green pepper if you like.  Also important would be the quality of the feta and the oil.  I would get a feta made with goat and/or sheep's milk as the typical grocery store feta is not nearly as good and doesn't have the nice texture of the goat or sheep feta.  Also, use a first cold pressed extra virgin olive oil.",
