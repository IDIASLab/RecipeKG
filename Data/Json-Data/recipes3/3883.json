I did make a few slight changes, boiling the green beans for 5 minutes and then shocking them in cold water since I don't have a steamer.  And I left the beans whole, but will probably cut them in half next time! And I did not have red onion so I used white onion and sauteed it (I do not like a heavy onion taste). Also the olive oil and vinegar is way too much in my opinion.  I only used 1/4 cup olive oil and the full amount of vinegar (but red wine instead) and there was a huge puddle at the bottom of my bowl.  Next time, yes there will be a next time for sure, I will use 1/8 cup oil and 2 tbsp red wine vinegar.  Five stars!!",
