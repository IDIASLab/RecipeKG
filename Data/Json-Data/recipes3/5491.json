Not sure how the potatoes and cauliflower would simmer without the addition of at least two cups of water (or broth). With the liquid, however, it got nice and saucy. I also doubled the carrots and added garlic. \nAlso, due to the low burning point of olive oil, it's a poor choice to use for frying. Olive oil also has a Mediterranean flavour that's not right for a curry dish, and it's expensive. Save your olive oil for a nice dressing and use regular vegetable oil and butter for this dish. \n",

Liked the suggestions of tomato paste and creme fraiche. I substituted thick chunks of yellow squash for the potatoes but may use potatoes another time. Didn't realize I had no turmeric on hand until I had the preparation well underway. I omitted the salt(because I used chicken broth)and pepper(reviewer's tip)and even with these omissions we thought it was very good. Since I didn't use potatoes I didn't see the need to pre-cook the vegetables so my cooking time was still only about 20-25 minutes. Glad I saw this recipe and thanks for the previous reviews - will definitely be making this again and again.",
