I was out of shells so I used angel hair pasta instead.  \nThis meal was yummy, super-satisfying, looked great and my kids ate it.  What else can I ask for?",

As others did I cup up the asparagus and sauted it with the mushrooms. I used crimini mushrooms (which are really just small portobellos) because Trader Joe's sells them cheap! Also used garlic & herb boursin (also from TJs) because I couldn't find the pepper flavored kind. Will definately make again and I'll be on the look-out for the pepper cheese. The cheese was not expensive at all. Very good recipe.",

Because we have to serve 8 I used 1 1/2 pounds of mushrooms a pound of pasta shells one can of vegetable broth and 2 bags of select asparagus spears. I also used 2 containers (4.4 oz) of the light garlic & herb boursin cheese. The result was wonderful. It tasted very much like a rich mushroom stroganoff. It is not terribly attractive--it looks pretty much like the picture shown. But everyone liked it & requested that we add it to our regular rotation. While I was making it the sauce looked very thin but once it was added to the pasta it was great--just the right amount and not thin at all. I will make this again--by popular demand.",
