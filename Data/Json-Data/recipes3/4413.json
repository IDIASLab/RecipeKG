The next time I have these I think I might try them with a spicy dijon mustard but for the most part, they are perfect alone. I will also use much smaller spoonfuls to make smaller fritters - maybe a little less than a tablespoon instead of a heaping tablespoon.",

Note these are TOTALLY WORTH the deep fried guilt I used a cup and 1/2 sour cream mixed in a tbsp of dill and a little garlic powder for a dipping sauce. TOTALLY MADE IT.;D Thank you for such an Awesome Recipe!!",

We didn't think they needed a dipping sauce at all; perfect as is.  Keep in mind that the blend of curry you use will have a lot to do with the outcome.  Curry is not a spice unto itself, it is a blend of several different spices and the flavor and strength varies widely.  I tasted the batter before frying to make sure the spice level was correct.\n\nIn regards to bad reviews b/c these were \"bland\" or \"unhealthy\" -- they were bland b/c the amount of curry needed depends on the blend you use, and if you don't want to eat something unhealthy, WHY are you making a FRITTER (which basically means FRIED BATTER) recipe?  \n\nAnyhow, after trying these with the original recipe and reading the reviews, I feel inspired to make a batch for Thanksgiving but omit salt and add brown sugar instead, omit curry powder and use pumpkin pie spices instead, then dust with powdered sugar when they're done frying.  \n\nThanks for a fantastic & versatile recipe!",

Very tasty and very easy to make. I did fry them in olive oil instead of vegetable oil but left the rest of the recipe the same as written. I drained them on paper towels before serving which soaked up a lot of the oil. Also by making them small and having the oil at the correct temperature they don't absorb a lot of oil. The addition of the curry is wonderful giving the fritters a nice taste without them being overpowering. Will definitely make these again. Thanks for the keeper recipe!",
