I was not expecting it to be so good! I think I just might win! I did use chicken broth instead of vegetable and I also added some cider as another reviewer suggested and cannelloni beans. I was planning on adding pasta but I don''t think it needs it! This will wind up in my recipe collection as something I will make regularly. As a dessert I made the sweet potato pound cake from this site I fear that gem won't make it out of the house.. At least I got to try this one out without anyone noticing something missing. UPDATE I got second place in my contest at work to sweet potato fries with dipping sauces I wanted a recount! People that like sweet potato and people that don't like soup alike asked for the recipe!",

I found this recipe and decided to give it a try since I'm a big fan of sweet potatoes. Boy was it delicious! I did make a few changes to make it even more yummy and easy to make. I only needed one large sweet potato. I used the food processor to slice up the potato thinly so the cook time would be reduced and the flavor could infuse the broth more easily. I highly recommend using a food processor to do the dirty work for you when you have a lot of vegetables to prepare. I shredded two carrots sliced 5 stalks of celery and chopped half of a red onion in a very short period of time. I added about a cup and a half of cider to the 4 cans of vegetable broth as one user suggest and I would highly recommend this step. I decided to only add one can of italian tomatoes since the cider added a lot of acidity as did the apple cider vinegar I added (about 2 tablespoons). Then to add even more flavor I added about a 1/3 cup of red cooking wine and 4 tablespoons cooking sherry. For spices I used about 3 tablespoons cumin 3 teaspoons thyme 1 tablespoon garlic powder and then I salt and peppered to taste. I will make this recipe again and again. Its healthy heart and it made me feel a whole lot better. This will be my vegetarian substitute for chicken noodle soup most definitely.",

My local store was out of vegetable broth so I bought the Lipton Vegetable Soup Mix (comes in the box like the Lipton Onion Soup Mix). I used 2 packages of the veggie soup mix and added 6 cups of water. And I was in a hurry and picked up the Italian Style STEWED Tomatoes by mistake instead of the diced. The sweet potatoes took me forever to peel and cut - they are sooo hard and it doesn't help I'm a pokey chopper. Maybe next time I'll put them in the micro for a few minutes first to make my life easier. In the end the soup turned out plentiful and tasty with enough to share with my neighbors and freeze.",
