I also tossed in some veggies (carrots, celery, yellow squash, & zucchini) that I needed get rid of, as well as some garlic.  I love thick soups, so I definitely want to make this again with the extra can of beans to make it thicker!  Rather than mashing 1/2 of the beans in a food processor, I just put my beans into a small Ziplock baggie & rolled my can of tomatoes over the bag until they were mashed.  Very easy...and no cleanup!",
