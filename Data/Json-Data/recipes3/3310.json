Second, I upped the chicken to 2 cups (I made two quiche) and so I also doubled the egg, milk, sour cream amounts.  I added extra cheese to both quiches (probably an extra 1/2 to each). It came out beautifully, loved it, will make again.\r\n\r\nAbout the ONLY thing to change was the cooking time - after I reduced the heat and continued cooking it, it was not done in 35 minutes, took an extra 15 to 20 minutes extra.  I would put it on the top rack and cook it the entire 50 to 55 minutes at 400.  Very yummy recipe.",
