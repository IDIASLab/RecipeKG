First, the cheddar is overwhelming, and this is coming from a gal who LOVES cheddar!  I will mix up the cheeses next time.  Some Monterey Jack to mix in maybe, to give a bit of heat.    Second, I will be cooking the quiche much longer next time.  I left it in 45 minutes, and it was a beautiful golden brown on top and the toothpick came out clean, but then... it was SO runny.  Not like a quiche at all.  Next time, I will add some flour to the mix, I think, and cook it at a lower temp for an hour+.    Still-- a great idea for a fish dinner that isn't boring, and remarkably easy and frugal to put together!  I never thought I would say that salmon quiche would be a go-to meal for busy nights, but once I tweak this a tad I am betting it will.",

I used some leftover baked salmon instead of canned and chopped green onions.  Also, because I didn't  have cheddar cheese, I used a combination of cream cheese, colby/jack, mozzarella and parmeson. So definitely try other cheeses if that is all you have. I'd bet this is more mixture than a standard frozen 9\" crust will hold.  I used Pillsbury rolled pie crust in my 9\" pie pan and it was a perfect fit.  Baked for at least 40 minutes.",

I also used 1T dried onion instead of fresh, a pinch of dill with the s&p and omitted the parsley and sage. I also cooked it at least 50 minutes until it began to puff a little.
