Luckily I had these ingredients on hand,  well, I did use margarine instead of butter and it worked great. I did add some coconut which I love in everything and it was terrific.\nThis is an easy peasy fudge recipe. I would suggest adding other things, such as candied cherries, nuts, coconut and or raisins.\nI would make this again and suggest others to try.",
