I used squash instead of the sweet potato because they are more carb & blood sugar friendly. Used 2 whole eggs instead of just egg yolks. Omitted the butter sauce for a healthier marinara to reduce calories. These would be great with a pesto or alfredo sauce also. Tip: if you have a scoop for cookie dough it works great for making the balls.",

I was so nervous about adding too much flour and after putting in 1/2 cup (doubling what the recipe suggests) I stopped out of fear. But the dough was still pretty moist. I figured maybe once i formed the gnudi and refrigerated that would help it to firm up. Wrong again. Once I dropped each gnudi into the boiling water they just opened up and turned to mush. I tried cooking for less time; I tried cooking more time and nothing worked. I think I just did not have enough flour. Ended up giving up. Luckily we had plenty of other sides so it wasn't missed. I'm still giving this recipe 3 stars because I'm sure this was a user error situation. But it would have helped me if the recipe could have a measurement for how much mashed sweet potato is needed. Perhaps I picked out potatoes that were too large and therefore had more water.",

The end product wound up being something not compatible with my diet. I tried cooking it with the original 1/4 cup of flour and they all just fell apart in the water. I had to add probably 1 1/2 or 2 cups of flour (lost track as I added) to get it workable. I still cooked them when the dough was a little sticky and just used the extra flour to coat the outside as I rolled them. Flavor was very good although I used very little butter to save some calories and sodium. Maybe letting the sweet potatoes sit out longer and mashing them into a much thinner sheet would help?
