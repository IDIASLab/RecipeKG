It's something that could easily be served at the Macaroni Grill. Enjoy!",

Then I found this recipe and was pleasantly surprised! It had just the right amount of spiciness and I liked that the chicken was crispy. One reviewer suggested using only one egg and I second that - 2 eggs would have been too much. I also just used regular chicken breast (instead of cutlet) and diced it. \r\nAnd I only used about half of the oil called for. Seemed like too much when it was in the pan. Good recipe overall and will make it again when I don't have the ingredients for the Chicken Sausage Pasta!",
