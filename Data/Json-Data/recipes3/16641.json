I used an alfredo sauce from a package which only made a cup and it disappeared into the pasta when I mixed it (see picture) but the flavour was still fantastic. My family loved the slight lemony taste it wasn't overpowering but it was a departure from the usual alfredo I make. I also used linguine cause I didn't have rotini would have been better with rotini. Oh I only gave four stars cause I think it would be improved with fresh spinach instead of frozen for real spinach lovers.",
