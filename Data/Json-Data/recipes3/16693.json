Eventually her mother started packing extras! I've since lost her recipe, but this one produces the same delightful flavor and texture I relished as a kid. Enjoy for breakfast, lunch, or snack.",

I think they would have been too watery if I added the whole amount of milk the recipe calls for. They came out really yummy! I used fresh chard that I blanched. To make preparation easier I chopped the onion and steamed chard together in my food processor. Make sure to get them nice and brown they are so good when crispy. I am planning to try them with lemon squeezed on top. YUM!",
