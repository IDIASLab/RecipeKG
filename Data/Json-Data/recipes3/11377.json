I served it with a cannellini bean salad. The texture was really creamy, and the flavor quite earthy and mellow. I'm sure that replacing the olive oil with duck schmaltz might have helped! I don't think I would have missed the garlic had I not added it. I will make this again. It makes a very quick meal if you throw it together in the morning and bake it when you get home from work.",

I followed the recipe - the only substitution I made was cilantro instead of parsley (I don't like parsley). It was okay, but a little bland for me. Kind of like a quiche, but not quite (it has no milk or butter). I know it's probably not \"kosher\" but I would have added shredded cheddar - that might have been the missing \"ooomph\" that it needed to be amazing. Thanks for sharing - I learned a little bit about Jewish culture by reading about this recipe in the magazine and then trying it myself. :)",
