I don't really like canned chili so I threw a pot together with Chili-O seasoning packet and it came out very good. I also added some Montreal Steak Seasoning to the ground beef since I use that on just about everything and love the flavor. I offered the recipe with chili on the side but almost everyone put the chili on their burger and raved about the taste. I might try this at some point in the future with sloppy joes as the topping. Great idea!",
