The stout was something that was a bit put off-ish in my book as well as my son's....but my husband and my 3 girls really liked it. I'll make again for them, but not for myself. However, if your a true guinness lover, then the recipe is totally for you. If you're not into guinness or don't have a liking for beer...then it's not.

I used Italian sausages as it was all I had on hand and I think that was the key to the flavor. I know it's not very authentic:) but plain pork sausages would have been too bland as others have said. We also grilled the sausages outside (because the weather was cooperating) and sauteed the onions in the bacon drippings before assembling (as I saw on another version of this recipe). Last tweak - about halfway through baking it looked like the top layer of potatoes was starting to dry out so I spritzed them with olive oil.",
