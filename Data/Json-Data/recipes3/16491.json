The only thing I've changed about this recipe is adding about 6oz. of seasoned artichoke hearts from a jar (did the canned once and did not enjoy the flavor). I drain them and cut them small. The bacon sounds like it would be a great addition but most of the people in this family are vegetarian. As for the first two reviews: 1. You should not review or prepare for that matter a recipe with ingredients you hate and 2. Fish???? I have no idea what you are talking about. Lastly This recipe is super easy to double and put one in the freezer for your next evening of entertaining.",

Those two ingredients particularly the salad dressing would certainly alter the taste of the dip. Personally I only use Hellmans Real Mayo and did not have any plain yogurt in the house for which I subbed with sour cream. I loved the idea of the other ingredients listed and even added some crisp chopped bacon to the mix. Because this was for a party I filled mini phyllo cups with the dip and baked. With these minor adjustments the appetizers were a huge success. Thanks Anne!",
