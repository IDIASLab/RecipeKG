Instead of cooking the potatoes in the pot until they\u2019re \u201ctender,\u201d I\u2019ll let them cook until they\u2019re \u201cjust about tender.\u201d  They go into the oven for 30 minutes at the end, so they\u2019ll  be fully cooked and, hopefully, firmer.  The milk didn\u2019t quite cover all of my potatoes, so I did move them around in the pot to be sure they all were submerged at one point.  When you stir in the cheese and breadcrumbs, even if you\u2019re trying to do it gently, the potatoes tend to break up, so my potatoes were just a little mushy.  Putting the texture issue aside, they were easy to make using a food processor to do the slicing, and most importantly, did taste very good, even with having to sub swiss (what was on hand) for the Gruyere.",
