But I made one significant change: I strongly recommend that you use fish sauce rather than soy sauce, if you can find it. I believe it is called nuoc mam in Vietnam, and nam pla in Thailand; those with expertise please feel free to correct me. Fish sauce gives the curry a characteristic flavor and aroma like what you find in Thai restaurant curries. IMHO soy sauce muddies the flavor.",

                "reviewBody": "Great recipe - but not quite perfect.  To avoid frying my tofu, I marinated it in the soy sauce, maple syrup and lime juice for about an hour and a half, and then baked for an hour at about 325 degrees, turning over once halfway through.  (Sounds excessive, I know, but it totally transforms the tofu - makes it chewier and more flavorful.)  Since I wasn't frying the tofu, I only used one tablespoon of oil.  I used lite coconut milk and it was fine.  I somehow managed to resist the incredibly strong urge to use fish sauce instead of soy sauce, figuring that (at least the first time) I should trust the recipe author; next time, I'll save my willpower for something with chocolate in it.  Although the soy sauce was totally fine, fish sauce would be better.  And I'm looking forward to adding a greater variety of veggies.  Still, this was a really good, simple recipe, and my favorite use to date of curry paste!  Thanks so much!  EDIT:  The second time I made this, I tried it with all fish sauce.  DON'T DO IT.  It's too much.  I had to throw the marinade away and start over.  2 T of soy sauce and 1 T of fish sauce seems to be about right; a pinch of salt really livens things up.  Still a great recipe!",

I also used agave syrup instead of maple (and way less of it...maybe 2 tsp.). We didn't have any basil so I used cilantro instead but not a ton of it (just a few leaves sprinkled over the top as a garnish). Oh and I let the veggies simmer a little bit longer than the recipe instructs. The combination of flavors in this dish is excellent. I served in shallow bowls over brown rice with plenty of the sauce for slurping.:) Be sure to drain your tofu really well before chopping and don't use any substitutions for the red curry paste.",

A few changes: 1) I used string beans instead of bell pepper because that's what I had on hand. 2) I also used cilantro instead of basil and 3) I minced a couple cloves of garlic and stir-fried it along with the ginger and curry paste. I make coconut/curry stir fries a lot and I never thought to use zucchini. It worked so well with the flavors in this dish.
