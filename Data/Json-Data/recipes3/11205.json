I know that I will make this again (tasted fantastic -- just needed salt when we served it b/c I took the submitter's suggestion and exchanged the french-fried onion for additional grated cheddar on top), but I would reduce the peas/carrots/green beans/zucchini/mushrooms to maybe 1/2 c. each. Oh, and I just mixed frozen peas, carrots and green beans in that way rather than zapping them at all, and when I sauteed the mushroom, I also lightly-sauteed the zucchini and onion. 425 deg for 20 min. started to scorch the cheese and noodles around the edges (a little crusty I'm down w/!) so I think next go-around, I'd go more like 350 covered for 20 min., then uncovered for 10-15 w/ the extra cheese on top. I'm glad that I made this and am able to give it a positive rating to hopefully knock that dopey 1-star review for \"not knowing what to do w/ the noodles\" - duh!",
