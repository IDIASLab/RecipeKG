My car was in the shop so no way to run to the grocers.\nThen I recalled seeing a couple of recipes that I thought I had ingredients for and found this one.  IT WAS A HIT!!!\nI used leftover peppered chicken breasts, sliced and warmed. No fresh tomatoes, so I used Del Monte canned tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano. Tossed in more garlic (never enough of that)and some fresh basil.\nWhen I served it:\nDrained and put the pasta on a large serving platter, poured the sauce over it, placed the warm chicken breast slices nicely over the sauce--added some fresh basil sprigs. It was a delicious as it was beautiful.\nI also made a topping (for on the side) of italian bread crumbs, chopped garlic,and fresh grated romano cheese. Threw that in a skillet and lightly browned it--tasted yummy over the pasta. \nServed it with some warm vienna bread.\nEveryone asked for the recipe and I felt like the local Martha!",

I modified things quite a bit but the bones of the recipe are good. Instead of using cream cheese I used whipping cream milk and fresh parmesan cheese to make a sauce. I browned chicken pieces in a skillet with olive oil onion and garlic until the onions were a little carmelized. I also added sauteed mushrooms a handful of capers about 6 sun-dried tomatoes (chopped into small pieces) and red pepper flakes for spice. I drained the spinach well and chopped it very fine. We topped it with more parmesan. This was quite tasty.",
