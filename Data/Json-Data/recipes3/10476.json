It was delicious but a bit more salty than it needed to be. What I am baffled about is the size of the pan in the recipe. The dish did not rise at all so I had flat squares. I think I would use an 8x8 pan next time so the squares have substance. It might take a little longer to bake that way but at least they would be higher and prettier to serve. Otherwise this is a decent recipe.",
