First of all I reduced the size of the recipe to 4 servings, so the measurements here reflect that.  I cooked and cleaned 2 (1 1/4 lb) lobsters, saved the juice that came out when I pulled them apart, (discarding all coral and tomally) cut up the meat and set it aside.  Then I put the broken up shells (excluding the part with the head, which I threw away) in a stew pot with about 2 1/2  cups of milk, along with the juice from the lobsters, and let it just barely simmer for maybe an hour. I strained all the shells out and discarded them, and then used this for the 2 1/4 cups of  milk the smaller recipe called for. I also sauteed minced fresh onion in the butter to soften it before I added the flour. I simmered the thickened broth for just a few minutes and then added the lobster meat, shut off the heat and just let it sit to blend the flavors. Too much simmering will overcook the lobster meat. I didn't use a whole tablespoon of paprika, either, and omitted the tsp of salt, but that is a matter of taste.",

Also I had no celery salt and no cream. I just used 5 cups of whole milk. The bisque was so creamy and flavorful with all the butter and whole milk I didn't miss the cream anyways. And as I do with all of my cream based soups I added about 2 teaspoons of red wine vinegar when I took the soup off the heat. I'm not sure what it does exactly but it gives all cream based soups extra depth. Soooo good! It hit the spot on this cold day!",
