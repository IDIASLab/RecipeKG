It's a rich dish that makes your kitchen smell so wonderful!  Once my family smells the ginger frying and coconut milk simmering, they can't wait for it to be done so they can dig in!  I salt it liberally as the coconut milk tends to hide the salt flavor.",

I served this over jasmine rice with a side of stir-fried veggies (eggplant zucchini red and yellow peppers). Delicious healthy quick dinner.",

How I cooked this: Heated 1 Tbsp butter in a pot that I could cover later browned 2 chicken breasts on both sides in the butter. After browning I cut the chicken into smaller pieces to cook faster. I added 1 can of coconut milk into the pot and also added ground ginger garlic powder and onion powder salt and pepper. Cooked with lid slightly propped open for about 20 minutes. Threw in some pre-washed spinach leaves and it was good to go.",

It is definitely rich and not for the calorie counters!  I can see why some call it a greasy dish as it uses skin-on chicken in addition to rich, creamy coconut milk.  If you prefer a lighter version (as my husband does) just use boneless skinless chicken breasts.  You won't get the same depth of flavor without the chicken fat, but it will still be very tasty and a bit lighter in the belly.  Also, some tasty additions I've found for this recipe are a bit of chopped garlic and thinly sliced yellow squash.",

I'm not a fan of dark meat and my family is only 3 people large so I made this with a pound of breast and only 1 can of coconut milk. Used the whole package of spinach and all suggested ginger for extra flavor. It was still too bland for me so I shook in a healthy amount of garlic powder and ground ginger at the end (and of course more salt). Served with brown rice and the family really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again - thank you for sharing your family recipe!! Even though I tweaked it to my tastes I still really appreciate the starting point.",
