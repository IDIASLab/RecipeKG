I tried to figure out a way to add a note to the recipe and was not successful, so I'll add the note this way and hope it reaches people.    It seems that reviewers have mixed feelings about the cinnamon in this recipe.  Some seem to really like it and add more, and others think that it detracts.  So, if you're gonna make this recipe, maybe it would be wise to take into account your palate for cinnamon and adjust accordingly.",

Using mostly fresh ingredients,  I put half of the marinade in the bottom of the pan and smeared the other half on top after only about a 40 minute rest period, max.  Cooked it till I could see the color change a quarter of the way up and less than half that on the second side. (Never pay attention to how many minutes to sear a tuna as they are different thicknesses, different temperatures and contain different amounts of water in the meat.) oh my god, the thick marinated gave it the sweetest crust, I love this recipe and my husband said I rose to the challenge and outdid myself.  We get competitive in our cooking!  Like this morning, he made a frittata with feta, basil and durian jelly ( an indescribable pleasure we have here in Bali). Enjoy this delight to the taste buds!",
