But really, how can you go wrong with coconut and pecans!\n\nAs another reviewer stated, don't be put off by the odd macaroni and cheese-like odor while you're cooking this up.  You'll smell the difference immediately when you add the coconut and pecans.  \n\nImportant to note - when cooking with eggs, unless you want scrambled egg bits in your frosting, I would highly recommend heating the butter and condensed milk in the saucepan first, then slowly incorporating a small amount of the hot butter/milk mixture(about 1/2 cup) into your egg yolks in a small bowl, whisking while you add.  Once you do that, add your egg mixture into the saucepan.  You should be able to avoid cooked egg bits with this method.",

It works great drizzled over a bundt cake...just let it cool for a few minutes. If it is too runny, add more coconut! Enjoy!",

The mixture bubbled, seized and separated, scaring me a bit.  It looked curdled and smelled strongly of macaroni and cheese.  Finally after boiling it for about 10 minutes after the cutoff time, I took it off the stove.  It was light tan and completely separated.  I whisked the mixture until the goo came together in a cohesive tan sweet goo.  The smell was gone, it tasted great and with the coconut, pecans and vanilla, it tasted and looked far better than the storebought stuff.  Good stuff!",

The evaporated milk version (which I found on a box of Baker's chocolate) has more flavor dimensions to it. This version is kinda flat by comparison. But it will do if you don't have evaporated milk on hand. Also you don't have to temper the yolks if you thoroughly whisk them into the milk before you start cooking the mixture. FYI the evaporated milk version calls for 1 (12 oz.) can evap. milk 1.5 cups sugar 1.5 sticks butter 4 egg yolks 1.5 teaspoons vanilla 7 oz. coconut and 1.5 cups chopped pecans. Prepare according to the directions noted in this recipe.",

But after cooking it for ten minutes and adding the pecans and coconut it was way too thick almost like taffy. Tasted good but wouldn't spread. So I just put it back on low heat and added heavy cream until it was smooth enough to spread turned out great. I like a recipe that you can go back and fix after messing it up!",
