The crumbs were very granulated and I didn't want to overwhelm the taste of the Dijon mustard sauce. I also added garlic powder to the sauce (1 teaspoon). After I made the sauce I really liked the flavor and added a side dish of cooked sliced red potatoes and drizzled the sauce over them when served. This dish was very moist after baking it uncovered for an hour and the potatoes with the sauce was excellent. This sauce will be used again on many of my recipes that calls for Dijon mustard.",

It was delish.  I also sprinkled a little bit of Parmesan cheese in with the bread crumbs.  This was a nice change.  Will make again!",
