My mother-in-law helped me make the risotto and it came out great.  We increased the recipe to serve six people.  We used a variety of exotic and dried mushrooms including black trumpet mushrooms.  We soaked the dried mushrooms in warm water for 30 minutes.  We saved this mushroom water and included it with the broth.  We used chicken broth instead of vegetable stock and we used Arborio rice (a must for risotto).  To keep things moving quickly we warmed the broth in a large pot along side the risotto on the stove.  We had a little extra broth left over (probably because we added the additional water from the mushrooms).  It took about 30-40 minutes for the rice to absorb all the stock.  Great recipe.  We will make it again soon.",
