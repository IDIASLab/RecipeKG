Doubled the garlic ran it thru my press; used Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar because it is THE best! No walnut oil but I DID have hazelnut oil! Fresh ground pepper Pink Himalayan Sea Salt (very chunky). Love endive but only had fresh redleaf lettuce and lacinto kale so chopped it all up delish. Used a Honeycrisp apple they are so crispy. Watercress (at least this fresh pile I have here) is so incredibly bitter/peppery I just love it! Detoxing or not this salad was a refreshing change worthy of company especially with a hot-summer rich meat like Smoked Salmon or Babyback Ribs. This recipe is one of the best I have ever experienced on AR. Will take a photo next time! Thank you!",

We all found the raw garlic taste overpowering and we LOVE garlic. You really couldn't taste the flavor of the walnut oil or the vinegar at all just garlic. It might be better if you saut\u00e9ed the garlic before adding it to the dressing. If I make this again I think that I would try this or maybe make a different dressing entirely. I'm truly at a loss as how all the other reviewers loved this dressing so much.",
