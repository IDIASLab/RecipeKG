I always bake it (375 - 35 min) and I use Kellog's Corn Flake crumb mixture (NOT the cereal - next to the bread crumbs in grocery store)instead of bread crumbs and the semi-sweet texture is marvelous and never soggy. Fresh dill and parsley are an absolute must - don't substitute! Very good with asparagus/hollandaise sauce as an accompaniment.",

Next, I baked it in the oven on 350 for approx. 15-20 minutes until the chicken was done.   \r\n\r\nI can't tell you how wonderful it is once it's done right.

I scaled the recipe for 6 servings and used a 6 oz. can of fancy white crabmeat which was less than $4 a can.  It worked really well.  I used neufactchel cream cheese which is lower fat but very good.  My boneless breasts were very big and meaty so I cut them in half and then sliced into them as directed for the pocket.  I used garlic and herb breadcrumbs instead of fresh. After I breaded them, I placed them into a large pan sprayed with cooking spray, drizzled a bit of olive oil over the top and baked for about 40 minutes at 375.  The result was very good.  Baking them reduces the fat and mess for easier clean up.",

For the filling, I just coarsly chopped an onion, took a handful of fresh parsley and dill and the cream cheese and put it into my little mini-blender, which worked out really well because everything dissipated nicely. I also baked this, I didn't pan fry it. I put it in a 350 degree oven for a half hour and they turned out wonderful. I fully recommend this recipe! :)",
