I added a few extra pieces of bread because it didn't seem like enough in my dish. It could have been because my bread slices were a little smaller than the ones the author used. I personally would have preferred adding some sauteed onion and red pepper but everyone else liked it as is. Preparing it the night before saved me a great deal of time and mess in the morning. I would make it again. Thanks for the recipe!",
