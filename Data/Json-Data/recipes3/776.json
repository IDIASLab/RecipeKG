                "reviewBody": "This is the recipe my Mama & I always make! The graham crackers cut down on the sweetness of other Buckeye recipes and in my opinion the texture they provide remind me of Reese's Cups! We always use the Gulf Wax (brand)/paraffin wax too instead of shortening. It makes the chocolate a little harder & alot more shiny! You usually find it in the canning section of the grocery store; where you'll find Sure-Jell canning jars etc.:) TIPS: 1). Either buy a box of graham cracker crumbs or use a processor to FINELY grind them. It's best not to have big chunks (if you can help it but they're still gonna be good either way!) 2). BEFORE you dip them put the balls on a cookie sheet put a toothpick in each one and FREEZE them for about 20-30 min. It will make them easier to dip. Even if you don't use the toothpicks still freeze them instead if just refrigerating them. It gives you more working time. And it's best just to take a dozen or so out at a time get those dipped then take out some more. (Unless you're really fast which I am not!):p Hope the tips help those who had \"dipping issues\"!:) EVERYONE always says these are the best Buckeyes they've ever had!",
