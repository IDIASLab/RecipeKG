I only made two changes - I used ground cumin instead of seeds (so I added the tomatoes and all of the dry seasonings to the pan first thing) and I added the onions a few minutes before the chickpeas so they could cook longer.  I left it on low heat on the stove until the juice was thick and the it was delicious!  I will definitely make this again.",

I used tomatoes fresh from our garden(super sweet) and served it with broiled slices of fresh baby eggplant and zucchini(from the garden) and all of it together made a fabulous lunch which tasted even better the next day! EDIT/UPDATE Yesterday I tried this for the first time with canned tomatoes instead of fresh(the season is over) and thought that an update was neccesary. I used a 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes which worked out well but b/c of the difference in flavor I ended up doubling all the spices and also added about 1/2 tbsp of ground cumin as well to get the same flavor I was used to with the fresh tomatoes. Also just to add like others have stated I saute the onions adding them to the seeds and then add the tomatoes. This is still one of my favortie go-to lunches!: )",
