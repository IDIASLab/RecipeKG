I used a Philips Viva air fryer and found that at 7 or 8 minutes they were almost burnt. I turned down the temp to 160C for another 5 minutes and they were crispy outside, tender - not mushy inside. There are many variables to consider (machine, size of vegetables, etc.), but this is definitely a fantastic way to cook Brussels sprouts! Thank you for the recipe.",
