You start off with a large bowl of cabbage and over time moisture is emitted from the cabbage as it ferments. So the size of the salad reduces quite bit. I did not have mangos so I added mandarin oranges. Although I added the fruit at the very end this probably added to the moisture also. All in all this is a very tasty salad and I will definitely make it again.",
