For the 2nd sandwich I tossed the crab in some zesty Italian salad dressing prior to putting it on the sandwich and this bumped up the flavor quite a bit. I loved all of the different textures and colors going on and this is one I would make again.  Next time I will add some red onion slices and maybe even some bacon.",
