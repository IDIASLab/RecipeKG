I have used alot of recipes from this site and only make changes when I do not have what is called for as the case tonight. Along with the tomatoes I used 1 can of diced tomatoes(zesty chili) as I did not have enough fresh to double the recipe. Also I am not sure if the egg at the end is really needed, my family feels it would be fine without and just have more of a tomato style sauce. I served with pasta and salad. We will put this into one of our many favorites for the Lenten season.   Thank you for a wonderful dish that could also be made with chicken for those folks that do not care for fish.",
