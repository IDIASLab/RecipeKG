Most cooked apple dishes are sweet so this is a really nice change for a savory side dish which was served warm with a pork entree. Next time I make this I will add some crumbled crisp bacon as suggested by the recipe author as that should only enhance its savoriness. Thanks Jin for sharing your recipe this is a good one!",

I fried a little bacon and used part of the grease this produced to sautee the apple and onions instead of adding butter. When cooked I seasoned with salt pepper and just a light sprinkle of seasoning salt I served this over a little cooked barley for supper saving a little for the next day to eat as a salad with just a tad of my favorite bleu cheede dressing. Both were unique and tasty. I'm very happy to have found this recipe. Thank you!",
