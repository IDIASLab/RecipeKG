Butterscotch to me is a holiday flavor and the gold tone of the dessert made me think it might make a nice addition to the Thanksgiving treat table. First off Butterscotch Cheesecake Bars is an easy dessert to make - no unusual ingredients and no difficult prep steps. I always appreciate no fuss no muss desserts especially ones that taste as good as these bars. If you're a butterscotch fan you'll love the way your kitchen smells while these buttery bad boys are baking. The word \"mouthwatering\" springs to mind. The best part is the Butterscotch Cheesecake Bars taste every bit as good as they smell; subtly salty sweet melt-in-your-mouth goodness in every bite. For those bakers who are big fans of Magic Bars (that glorious layered concoction made with sweetened condensed milk baking chips coconut graham cracker crumbs et al) Butterscotch Cheesecake Bars may pack the the same sweet punch. Five shiny gold stars!",
