I even impressed MIL and SIL who thought they'd hate it because they don't like scallops. They took seconds;-)!! This is one of the few things my husband will request if I haven't made it in a while. I make this recipe as a way to use up fresh vegetables I have on hand. I make a few small changes when I make this. 1) I use an extra 1/2 cup of cold milk with the flour to thicken the sauce. Using the hot milk from the pan makes the flour mixture gummy; 2) I use 3 cloves of garlic minced and saute with the onion; 3) I add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese after the flour/milk combination to thicken it a bit more and punch up the flavor. Make sure to use plenty of salt and pepper as well.",

However this recipe amounts to boiling your vegetables and seafood in milk. The onion and garlic BARELY come through and the sauce was SO runny. To let it \"thicken \" as the recipe advises would have taken so long that the vegetables and seafood would have been way overcooked. Putting a little Bay Seasoning on it at the end helped a bit with the flavor.",
