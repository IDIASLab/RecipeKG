It's also kinda fancy for the minimal effort required!:) I used the frozen Pacific Salmon filets from Costco (only 2 of them = 10oz) I think that next time if I am cooking up a full box of 12 or 16 oz's spaghetti like the recipe calls for I will bump up the amount of salmon to spread the sauce further and increase the sauce-noodle ratio. Cooking for 2 we had enough leftovers for about 4-5 lunch-sized servings after eating this for dinner! YUM! Definitely keeping in my favorites for a more regular dinner rotation!",
