I used red-skinned potatoes and black olives right out of the can. It looked great and tasted so flavorful and refreshing on our 4th of July picnic. Thanks for the recipe!",

I will use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and thick greek yogurt to keep the dressing from becoming too runny. It was a nice change from a traditional mayo-based potato salad and pretty healthy for you. It was a good side dish to marinated and grilled New York strip steaks and homemade french fried onion rings...peach shortcakes completed the meal.",
