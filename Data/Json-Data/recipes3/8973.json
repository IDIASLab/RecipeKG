I wanted to follow the exact directions though. I ended up with about 1/2 of the cormeal leftover. Also, on some of them the skin stayed tough. Make sure to cut them the 1/8\". The thinner ones were the best. In addition, make sure to use a smaller yellow squash. On the larger, or over grown ones, the skin is naturally tougher and with larger seeds. The ones I made with the overall smaller yellow squash were the ones that turned out well.",
