Warning - watch the heat of your griddle - I usually use a 1/4 cup measure for pancakes and did so with these but the bottom tries to burn before the top is set which makes flipping them rather messy.  After a couple of disasters I started making smaller pancakes, about the size of a silver dollar and that worked much better.  I think it is the natural sugar from the apples that causes the quick browning - the smaller size really helped the top to set and make it easier to flip them.",

I used 1.5 cups flour, 1 cup milk, 1 large Fuji apple, 2.5 tsp baking powder, 1/4tsp salt, 1.5tsp cinnamon, 5.6TBS melted butter, 2 eggs. Flavor is on point. Trying a lower temp on the griddle for the second batch so the middle cooks. Will definitely play with the basic recipe to find my own.",
