Working with only a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries I added 2 Tablespoons of sweetened coconut (after saut\u00e9ing the nuts) to make sure I had a good sweet balance. The nuts and the coconut worked well! I worried it would be bland and added another T of butter (to make it 4 not 3). The extra butter was unnecessary. Oh! I forgot to spray the pan but it seems ok (esp w my extra butter).",

So I'm taking his feedback with a grain of salt. I followed the recipe as listed other then using chopped almonds because I did not have slivered ones. I also sprayed the baking dish with a butter-garlic spray grease but don't think that added anything to the flavor. I really liked the long hands-free baking time.....it gave me plenty of time to make the rest of dinner and relax a bit. It is a beautiful looking rice dish and I'll make the side again. I'll only 1/2 it next time....that will be more manageable for my family of 5.",
