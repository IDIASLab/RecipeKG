There are only two in my family, but that just means plenty of yummy leftovers. Serve this chili with cheese on top and a thick slice of homemade sourdough bread and you've got a winner. The measurements are approximations since I'm more of a shake and dab type of cook, but this is generally right. This gives more kick than you might think, so be lenient with the pepper flakes if you are serving kids!",

Maybe more beans too?\" I agree w/ another reviewer that despite the recipe's cute title it doesn't call for any more garlic than any other chili recipe that I've made. I also didn't find it to be spicy at all and I even used fire roasted garlic diced tomatoes. The only thing that I changed was swapping onion flakes for diced onion that I sauteed w/ the beef. It's a nice basic chili that in my opinion needs a better ratio of beef to beans more garlic (to suit its title) and more heat.",

I added some pickled jalapeno's for a little more heat and a tsp of mustard (it gives chili AMAZING flavor). I will definitely use the recipe as a base recipe from now on though so thanks!!",
