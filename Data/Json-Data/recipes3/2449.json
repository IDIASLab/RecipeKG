I altered it a little, a can of cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and add rosemary, thyme, allspice, and cloves to the pork chops while they are browning (it smells great and tastes better) and then allow the chops to simmer in the cream soup. I always have seconds, and seldom have leftovers!",

For one, I preseasoned my pork chops and I cooked it alittle longer in the skillet before adding the sauce.  Also, one of the critism by a few reviewers was that the sauce smelled/tasted like chicken but the meat was pork.  Well, I took that into consideration and used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth.  It turned out great.  It did not smell or taste like chicken.  I will certainly use this recipe again.",

I also add some ground black pepper and curry powder and include green pepper and mushrooms while I cook the onion. It is simple and very tasty. If you want to leave it unattended while you do other things pour the whole thing into a greases and covered casserole dish and put it in the oven for 20 minutes at 325. I serve it with over buttered egg noodles. Simple tasty and hearty on a winter's night.",
