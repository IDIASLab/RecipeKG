So to shorten the time I browned the beef in a skillet, then I cooked the carrots, celery, and onion with the salt and pepper in another skillet.  Then I added the beef and the spinich and wine (Then I put the lid on the skillet for a few minutes)Also instead of using a fresh tomato I used 1c of crushed tomato. This seriously cut down on the time.  Then I followed everything until it came to the sauce.  I used the rest of the crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes and I roased some garlic.  I didn't have anymore onion so I left that out of the sauce.  This dish turned out super great!  I would make again, but will be more prepared with how much time it takes to make.",
