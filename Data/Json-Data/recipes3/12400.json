There is no way you can properly cook these in 3 tablespoons of oil, in my opinion.  The recipe states to drop by spoonfuls, but doesn't indicate what size spoonfuls and with the recipe yield of 4, each serving would be much larger than a spoonful.  After only cooking on one side for two minutes, they had burned.  The consistency was way too dense for our liking, as well.",
