I have earned the reputation as the Soup Nazi (Seinfeld  lol).  I hate bleu cheese but liked this soup. I used cream cheese instead of milk and fresh spinach (frozen spinach often has a fishy smell and taste). Customers like a soup with texture so I didn't puree anything. Tastes good and looks good.

I sit at my computer eating the bowl of soup in the pictures I submitted and it is creamy and smooth and just the right thickness but extremely light in both spinach and bleu cheese flavors. Oh they are there but you've got to concentrate to find them. No doubt that is why young children and spinach- or bleu cheese-hating adults like it and that in itself is a plus for the recipe. However I was looking for something stronger in flavor. I'll make it again and make my broth with lots of spinach plus double the amount bleu cheese. PS: I used no-salt-added broth and added 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/4 tsp cayenne and that seemed about right for the half-recipe.",
