Please try this, people! the only change i made was using white wine (sauvg blanc) instead of vinegar, and i omitted the parsely.  everything else i doubled (well, except the hotsauce & cayenne b/c of the hubs taste preferences. me, i'd of loved a kick but i love the man more...) then realized i needed more marinade due to the amount of fish i had (1.50 pounds) so i doubled again. marinaded the swordfish for just over 90 minutes and OH. MY. GAWD!!  i personally could not stop raving about how delicious the flavor was even though i was the host. but everyone else was raving as well so i was only joining the chorus. truly the best swordfish i have ever, ever had.",

I added 4 cloves of garlic I had 4 steaks and also upped all of the spices by 1/2 of what was called for. These were extremely tasty and tender! It was a hit with the family the flavors all came together perfectly and gave the fish a taste that wasn't over powering on anything. I'll keep this for quick weeknight dinners as what I was looking for tonight for a long time. I'm so surprised this doesn't have more ratings it's not always about the ratings it's about the ingredients and if they fit your likes!!!",

I had to make some substitutions though: (a)didn't have lime so used lemon juice instead (my wife doesn't like lime anyway) (b) didn't have white wine vinegar used white cooking wine (c) didn't have ground ginger used fresh chopped ginger about 2 teaspoon (d) didn't have hot pepper souce used more cayenne - maybe 1 teaspoon (e) didn't have thyme used marjoram instead. This last change worried me a little bit as the two herbs are quite different - but it worked out quite well. Next time I am going to eliminate ginger (it seemed to be unnecessary) and maybe increase pepper/cayenne to add more zing to it.",
