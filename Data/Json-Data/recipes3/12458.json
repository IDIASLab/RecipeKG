It is such a small amount that I didn't think it would ruin it for us but we don't like cinnamon so I wasn't going to take any chances. I really liked the flavor the three different peppers added and everything seemed to be spot on except for the seasoning. I ended up adding double of what the recipe called for when it was all said and done. Easy fix though and this is one I would make again.",
