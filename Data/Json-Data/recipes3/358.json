I gradually creamed together 2 cups of the sugar with the softened butter and it was stiff instead of light & fluffy. So I blended in the banana and then added the remaining sugar gradually until smooth. It was the perfect topping to the banana cake I found at this site.  The coconut made all the difference in giving my cake other flavor than just banana.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Thank you.",

I only used half of the amount of powdered sugar since the banana cupcakes I was putting it on were plenty sweet. I also used walnuts instead because I prefer them. DEFINATELY toast the coconut and the nuts before you add them it! It adds the best flavor! Be careful not to whip it too much because the banana starts to separate from the butter. To solve this I threw the nuts and coconut in while they were still warm which melted it all back together. Then I put it in the fridge until it cooled down and was a spreadable consistancy. I frosted 22 cupcakes and still had some leftover.",
