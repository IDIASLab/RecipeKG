However...once I noticed it starting to come off I just took a deep breath and made sure that I was VERY careful about how I flipped the fish afterward. As a result most of the coating stuck.

To address other reviewers' comments about the breading coming off, I pressed both sides of each fish fillet into a plate of the seasoned breadcrumbs to thoroughly cover the fish.  The key to not losing the breading is to NOT MOVE THE FISH once you have placed it into the pan.  Cook over a medium heat for the suggested four minutes on each side, and carefully turn and place on other side, again NOT MOVING THE FISH!  With added seasoning to the fish before coating, this is a winner, and I look forward to making it again.",

Whenever I bread and fry anything I follow a few simple steps. First, dry off whatever you are frying. Next, I always dredge first in flour and then put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes. Next I dip it in whatever wet ingredient im using (usually egg), bread it in the crumbs and throw it back in the fridge for another 15 minutes and then finally fry it up. I learned this \"fridge\" method many years ago (dont remember from whom) and have used it ever since. My method obviously adds some extra time to your prep but I never have a problem with breading falling off in the pan.",
