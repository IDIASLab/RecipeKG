It does taste like classic salad that you might get in the deli but of course with a homemade boost. I would have liked my potatoes a little softer but I always prefer to err on the side of a little firmer over mushed potatoes. It is very tasty while still a little warm. I will serve it to hubby later and he s going to love this one. He likes these mustard pickle type potato salads. I always made my potatoes for salad by boiling the cubes I had pre-cut and have never been thrilled at my results. I thought it kind of sped things up but it doesn t really. Maybe cutting them up first boils some of the flavor out of them. There is something different about the taste of the whole boiled potatoes cut up and mixed with the mayonnaise while still warm.",
