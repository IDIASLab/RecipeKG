I made some slight modifications to the recipe however: used apple cider instad of \"hard\" cider, added a clove of garlic when browning the pork, used McCormick's Montreal Seasoning on the pork while browning,   added a 1/4 of 14 oz can of saurkraut to the apple mixture before baking, and ended up making the sauce more of a gravy by thickening it with flour in the end).  Served with mash potatoes and steamed asparagus.  The gravy has a sweet taste and was delicous and the pork was excellent - very tender. I'd make it again. My fiance loved it.",

I'd check it after 30 minutes and go from there.",

Still, very yummy. I'll definitely make it again.",
