I've never had much success with homemade hashbrowns, always because I have just tried frying up plain grated potatoes, and I thought I would look for an actual recipe that might yield something a bit more restaurant-quality. This recipe is definetly it! They weren't greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too. Next time, I think I will add my salt & pepper, plus some extra spices, to the shredded potato and egg/flour mixture, just to give it a more intense flavor. This recipe is so easy that I will have no problems just making these hashbrowns from memory, eyeballing the flour and spices, etc. Highly recommended!!!",

The hash browns were golden and crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle.  \n\nMy girlfriend said she felt like hash browns with bacon and onions in them so I used this recipe as my starting point.  First, I pan-fryed 6 bacon strips until crispy (next time I will use at least 8).  Then I broke up the bacon into tiny pieces and added them into the mix with the other ingredients along with 1/2 red onion chopped, sea salt and cracked black pepper.  Also, i made little hash brown patties rather than covering the whole pan.  They really turned out nice.",

                "reviewBody": "Isn't it great when you can create something in the kitchen using simple ingredients. Here's a few ideas of playing around with an already excellent recipe. 1. Where the recipe calls for squeezing the liquid out of the shredded potatoes... it REALLY means it. Make sure all the liquid is gone. You might place the shredded potatoes in the middle of a clean tea towel, or cheesecloth, form into a small pouch, and squeeze. 2. If you're looking for a way to reduce the oil, here's a trick. Go to a local cooking store, and purchase an oil mister. Then pick up a bottle of grape seed oil (make sure it's unflavored). Grape seed oil will not impart any additional flavor to the dish, and it has a high smoke point. Fill the mister with the oil (a mister is like a refillable spray bottle). Now, get the hash browns ready for cooking. Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat, and then use the mister to spray the surface of the pan, and finally add a half tablespoon of sweet butter. Cook the hash browns until the outer surface is crispy, but not burned (about 5 minutes per side). They will taste great... without all that oil. You might want to sprinkle some finely grated cheddar or harvarti cheese over the top... up to you, and your guests. Serve while still nice and hot. They will be crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Keep the faith, and keep cooking.",
