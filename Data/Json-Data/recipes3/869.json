I use fresh broccoli and carrots lightly steamed. I also use half cottage cheese half ricotta (both low fat). I find that is a good combination of texture and moisture. And instead of parmesian cheese I use a Italian-style cheese blend from Aldi's. I recommend spraying the pan with cooking spray cooking the pasta in the water that you steamed the veggies for added flavor. I would recommend letting the dish stand 5-10 min before cutting so it has a chance to \"set up\". This is delicious with warm Italian bread and a green salad.",
