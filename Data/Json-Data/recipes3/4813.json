We just leave out the dashi, add several pounds of bok choy (they weigh less after steaming or boiling), and put in a package of Chinese preserved mustard tubers.  Some suggestions on how to make the wontons more authentic-looking: 1. Place 1 tsp. of the meat in the center of the wrapper, 2. Place water on the edges of the wrapper, 3. Fold the bottom of the wrapper to match the edges of the top of the wrapper to form a rectangle, 4. Fold the top part of the rectangle (the part that's not wrapping the filling that's stuck together) over the filling part, 5. Turn the wrapper over so that the folded part is folded upward in the back, 6. Bring the top 2 edges of the rectangle together, and use water to stick them to each other securely.  It takes me roughly 1 hour to wrap 150 wontons, but for some it may be longer or shorter.  Happy wrapping!",

Dashi is a stock made from boiling seaweed and bonito flakes and is commonly used as a base for soups like miso soup ramen or even wonton soup. This is otherwise a good recipe though I don't care for shrimp and the extra salt isn't needed with the soy sauce. I use dashi as my stock (cover a 4x4 sheet of kombu seaweed with 4c cold water in a pot bring to boil; immediately remove kombu and add 4c bonito flakes; boil for a minute then strain. The bonito and kombu can then be reused in another 4c water; bring all to a boil and simmer 10 minutes; strain). I also occasionally add daikon radish to the soup and water chestnuts to the wontons.
