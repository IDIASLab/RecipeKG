I usually use the fingerling red, white and purple potatoes for color, and 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup of chicken or vegetable stock for more complexity in the overall flavor.  To amp of the level of sophistication add 4 ounces of gorgonzola cheese to the mix.  It makes the most creamy sauce imaginable.  NOTE:  to keep your garlic from drying out, brush the top with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with a very thin slice of butter prior to baking!  Your taste buds will thank you!

I used dried rosemary because that's what I had on hand, and I halved the recipe since there were just two of us. I regret not making the full recipe because they were that good. I would recommend tossing the potatoes in the olive oil prior to dotting with butter and drizzling with white wine. That way you don't have any potatoes get dried out while roasting.",

I did not have any fresh rosemary so I did a quick online search to find the dried equivalent. The site I found said 1/2 tsp was equivalent to one sprig of rosemary. I was also cooking this along side a roasted chicken (each in their own roasting pan) so I cooked them at the temp and time for the chicken (350 degrees for 1 hr 15 mins)and they were cooked perfectly. I found the potatoes needed just a little more flavour but these were a VERY god roasted potato with our roast chicken and steamed asparagus.",

It took a lot longer to cook than 45 minutes but I lost track of how long I ended up leaving them in the oven (maybe a total of 2 hours?). There wasn't much in the way of taste in the potatoes and I'm not too sure what if anything the white wine did for them. Since the garlic did cook perfectly I went ahead and squeezed it into the potatoes and mixed it all in. The end result was ok. I paired this with he \"Quick Chicken Marsala\" recipe here on the site which was perfection! Photos added.",
