I only had three people for dinner so I altered this a bit to make in individual parfait glasses. I brushed leftover turtle brownies with Starbuck's liqueur then chopped them in 1/2 inch pieces. I subbed a package of Dream Whip for the frozen topping because you don't have to wait for it to thaw and used one package of chocolate mousse mix. I layered this as directed in the recipe with the crushed toffee bars and topped it off with just a little more of the crushed toffee bars rather than the chocolate bar. Very pretty little parfaits and came together in minutes.",
