I also used extra spinach and next time will use a little more.  I literally threw this together in no time and then added some medium shrimp during the last few minutes.

Instead I sauteed the onions/garlic/mushrooms and left the spinach/tomatoes/feta uncooked and mixed them in afterwards. Turned out very good and was really fresh tasting because of the uncooked portion. The spinach became tender from the residual heat but wasn't mush and the tomatoes kept their firmness but still released their juices. All in all it was very good. Would make it again for sure.",
