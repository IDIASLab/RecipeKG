Had good heat but the flavor remained in tact.\n\n3) I used Boneless Chicken Breast instead of the Bone in Thighs, chicken stayed really juicy and delicious. I'm sure it would work with the thights as well, but it was what we had in the house.\n\n4) I added some dried apricots for a bit of sweetness to counterbalance the Heat.\n\n5) I couldn't find a single store in my neighborhood that sold preserved lemons... so I just used fresh lemons.\n\nSo in the end, maybe I ended up making an entirely different recipe... but the spice blend on the chicken and the timing all really came together for what my wife declared \"one of the best dishes I have ever made her\"\n\nHave already made it a second time!",
