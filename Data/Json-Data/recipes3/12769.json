I also only used 12 oz. of pasta instead of 16 oz. since that is the size the bowtie pasta box.",

I will add some broth tonight when I reheat the leftovers. The cooking time for the asparagus will vary on the diameter of the asparagus. I used the fatter ones so I would suggest adding it earlier as it took at least 5-6min to become tender and not chewy.",
