Really east to work and handle I think I could user it in lots of diferent ways I used Fliimsy's idea for cinnamon rolls this time. There was a little bit of a bitter taste from the baking soda (so not 5 ) so I'm going to reduce the amount next time and hope I will still get good results. Thanks for the recipe.",
