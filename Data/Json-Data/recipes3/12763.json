I made a couple changes to suit my preferences and what I had in the house:\n\nInstead of milk I used half & half. I did about 2.5 Tablespoons of flour instead of 3 and that achieved the perfect consistency for me. I threw in some sharp cheddar in addition to the parmesan. I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1 because I wanted a big garlic flavor. I also added crushed red pepper flakes, and dried Italian herbs because I didn't have any fresh. Saving this recipe!",
