I made in my food processor; if you use a processor I recommend chopping the onion tomato olives and basil and then adding the artichoke hearts at the end. They only need 1 or 2 pulses to chop them coarsely otherwise they get too fine and the texture of the salsa is not as good. I also added feta cheese and served with pita chips and blue corn tortilla chips. Everyone raved about this yummy dip.",

I added McCormick's Grinders of Italian Herbs and Sea Salt. Will wait to summer growing season to make this with oregano basil parsley ect. What ever your taste buds feel like. Fresh herbs will be the best. Also fresh grated Parmesan cheese enough to see it in every scoop. This is a great base just add your flavors. At the Super Bowl party we served it on thinly sliced Italian bread like a Bruschetta. TASTY!! YuM!!!!",
