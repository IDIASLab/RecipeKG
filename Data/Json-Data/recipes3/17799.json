Next time I am going to try something sweet on them, I saw someone on a cooking show use honey on them, I think cinnamon sugar would be good.",

Update: After making variations on this recipe a few times I've made the following adjustments: - Rinse the beans - Make like a jelly roll to dry the beans. Put down a dinner plate then 3 continuous sheets of paper towels with the edge at the edge of the plate cover the plate with beans fold the paper towels over the beans then roll the paper towels up - Use this basic recipe but with other spice mixes like ranch dressing powder Chex Mix seasoning or tajin.",
