The only thing I will do differently next time is to skip the pepper simply not a good partner to the eggnog. A sprinkle of powdered sugar or a grind of fresh nutmeg on top might be good additions. It did take closer to 10 minutes to cook this but that s still not a whole lot of time. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

The cooked texture reminded me of a soft quiche with the volume of egg nog to egg ratio. I was using a 6-in pan over #2 heat setting, which could be why it took so long, but I finally gave up on waiting for the beautiful flip and just went with semi-scrambled. I added just a dash of salt and a few grinds of pepper, and that was fine for my taste, but after the first couple of bites, I added a sprinkle of nutmeg - be careful with the nutmeg because it can be too strong.",
