The next time I make this I'm going to skip the breading - unfortunately (as I suspected would happen) once the legs are in the liquid the breading gets soggy. Plus it really doesn't add anything to the flavor or texture. I would fry the legs without breading. Otherwise the flavor is good especially once you add the bacon which lends a smokiness to the sauce.",
