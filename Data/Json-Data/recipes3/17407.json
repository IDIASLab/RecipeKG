This turned out really good! We have made a LOT of summer sausage and with venison too but this one had the best texture of all of them by far. Most get kind of a wet smacky texture but this stayed the perfect firmness. While the texture was SPOT ON the flavor lacked a little in my opinion. I will add more of the seasoning and add some cayenne pepper or even more black pepper next time. This is a keeper and one I intend on playing around with more once I have venison. Thanks for sharing!",
