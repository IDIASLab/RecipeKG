It steamed perfectly and added some beatiful color flavor and nutrition (gotta get it into the toddler somehow!). I also love this recipe because unlike plain rice the leftovers don't dry out and you can enjoy it several days later. Thank you for this go-to side dish that I can pull out on a moments notice and impress company.",

I also added a  little garlic powder before boiling the rice.  I also made mine in my electric skillet which made clean-up a breeze (the butter I burned in a separate pan).
