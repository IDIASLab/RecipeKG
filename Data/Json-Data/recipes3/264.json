This is best if you prepare it the day before and let it set in the fridge over night.  Super quick.  Super easy.  Always a crowd pleaser.",

For better taste, let sit a day or two. It blends the flavors well and balances the sweet/tart flavor.\r\nJuicing and zesting the limes takes a few extra minutes but well worth the reward.
