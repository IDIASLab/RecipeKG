I used a 30 oz bag of Oreda shredded hash browns, defrosted and mixed them with melted butter then pressed it into the bottom and sides of 9x13 pan.  I baked it for 25+ minutes til  edges were a bit brown.  I refrigerated the crust overnight.  Since you can use any filling, I used about 1 \n1/2 cups cooked sausage instead of ham plus lots of monterey jack cheese.  I used 6 eggs and about 1 1/2-2 cups of half and half.  I poured that in the next morning and baked 30 mins.  Next time I might add some green onions with sausage.  Ham was good when I used it before but sausage went over well.  Just depends on your preference.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!",

For example, I was using a 10-inch glass pie pan, and when I dumped the 24 oz. of potatoes in a bowl, I was like, there is no way that 24 oz. of potatoes will even fit in this pie pan. I used 10 oz. potatoes. Also, there is not quite enough custard to even come up to the top of the 10 oz. of potatoes. So for this recipe, I recommend using 10 oz. of potatoes, 3/4 c. whipping cream, 3 eggs, and maybe 1 1/4 c. grated cheese. This filled my 10-inch glass pie pan. If this is all you're eating for breakfast, you'd probably eat 1/3 or 1/2 the pie per person for breakfast.",
