I did make a few adjustments:  I browned 3 hamhocks in the Instant Pot and then actually cooked it in a large pot on the stove.  Also, instead of shredded carrots, I just used a \u00bd bag of baby carrots, chopped.\n\nInstead of the 6 cups of chicken broth, I used 6 cups of water and 4 heaping tablespoons of \u201cBetter than Bouillon\u201d chicken flavor from Costco .\n\nInstead of dried navy bean, I used 6 cans of white beans, drained and rinsed.\n\nI didn\u2019t have diced tomatoes, so I used a 14.5 ounce can of stewed tomatoes with Italian herbs.\n\nEven the kids loved it!  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!",

My beans were not done at 34 min. and they soaked up most of the stock. So I added 2 more cups of stock re-pressurized for another 10 minutes and did a quick pressure relief. Came out perfect. Not a big deal. Maybe I just like my beans a little softer. The Instantpot website lists navy bean cooking time as 20-25 which is even less. I also don't know why the beans absorbed so much stock. I did use a can of roasted garlic diced tomatoes because I had them and a little less garlic.",
