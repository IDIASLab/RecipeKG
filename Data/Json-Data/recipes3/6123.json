In the morning I thinly sliced them on a hand grader instead of grating to get a texture closer to scalloped potatoes, and left the skin on because we like them. I mixed as directed except I used dehydrated onions instead of fresh. I refrigerated  them about 6 hours before baking. I tasted them before cooking and they reminded  me of potato salad. I wasn't sure how they would be. At the last minute I decided to dice and mix in about 10 slices of land o lakes white american cheese before baking. I don't think it needed the cheese but it was DELICIOUS  Thanks Ricci, whoever you are (=     I will be uploading my pic soon",
