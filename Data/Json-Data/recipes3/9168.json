I tweaked it a little by substituting the spelt flour for organic pastry flour soy milk with unsweetened vanilla almond milk the agave with organic raw honey. there was enough to freeze for lunch next week. I also made a small amount with the spelt which was great also. The flours were sifted twice also. please follow the resting time it might look soupy when its mixed but it thickens up!!!",

So this will become my staple when I'm in the mood for pancakes.",
