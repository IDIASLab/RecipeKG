The secret for truly authentic is to start the eggs on low temp and stir with chop sticks in order to get the long egg strains similar to egg drop soup. Take the eggs out and set aside. Turn up the heat to med-high add a little more oil and then stir fry the tomatoes. Once done take off heat and add eggs back to wok to re temper and serve. Thanks for reminding me of this great authentic dish!",
