Just a few modifications: since queso fresco does not melt I will probably use a different cheese next time (maybe Monterrey cubes or even pepperjack). Also make sure to reserve some of the water from boiling the plantains to add to when mashing otherwise they are too dry and will crumble when molding into balls. Finally if you are a garlic lover you can add a couple of pressed cloves or some garlic powder when mashing it will enhance the flavor. Serve with avocado and some sewed meat and presto!",
