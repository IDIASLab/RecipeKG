I love that they incorporate two ingredients I love; chia seeds and quinoa. I made 2 ever so slight adjustments: I only had creamy peanut butter, and I didn't have flax meal so I substituted 1 mashed banana and it worked like a charm. Bonus: all 5 kids love them too! Thank you, this one's a keeper.",
