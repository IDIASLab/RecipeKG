I did half with fresh cilantro and half with fresh parsley and I liked the cilantro better (but I love cilantro); the parsley batch had a nice fresh flavor. I tried adding some (thawed) frozen corn and thougth that was good. I added some more chopped red onion since that gave it nice flavor and crunch and a bit more tomato was good.",
