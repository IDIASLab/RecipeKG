Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab, the recipe is a very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of investigation, and even more experimentation, I think this is very close.",

I used half of the 12 oz Spaghetti package but next time I will use the whole package so I can have some leftovers ( or eat more). I did add some shrimp in the final step. My wife loved it. She had passed the recipe  on to our two married children because how good it was. I think ever Ingredient added up to making the dish perfect ( such as the small amount of cheese, and the small amount of green onions), so try not to leave anything out. I almost left out the green onion because I thought it might just be for color, but it added a nice flavor for the small amount called for. I have been trying to use my wok more ( great videos on wok cooking on YouTube) and this worked great in it. This  recipe is a keeper!",

Other changes I made include reducing the butter by half and doubling the secret sauce ingredients.

I could not get the parmesan to incorporate like in an alfredo sauce, so I guess I will try again tomorrow.  This recipe is seriously great!",
