Great way to make a colorful side dish, and it complimented a pork tenderloin that I roasted alongside it. Oh, and I didn't use any lemon juice til leftovers the next day, where, to my surprise, the veggies tasted just as good, if not better, at room temperature (not sure the lemon jived though.)",

I think they were better with but they were pretty good without too. I think next time I'll try it as a stir fry rather than a roast as someone else suggested. All in all it's a good simple way to present vegetables and herbs. I'll try experimenting with it more in the future. Update: I made it again today 12 17 2017 with added crimini mushrooms and shaved parmesan cheese on everything before baking. It was delicious.",
