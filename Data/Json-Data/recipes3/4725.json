They are said to have kept the meat underneath their saddles and mince it in this way. Today this dish is a gourmet classic. This dish is eaten like a pate, spread on a piece of warm toast with fresh tomato and onion rings on top. It is very important though to make sure that both the meat and the egg are very fresh because they are eaten raw.",

There is no comparison with respect to texture, presentation and flavour.\n2. I prefer Pikapeppa Sauce or Cholula to Tabasco; both have superior flavour and complexity.  For a nicer presentation a food mold can be used.\n3.  Adding brandy is an excellent idea, especially something interesting  like Calvados.\n4. The quality and freshness of the ingredients cannot be overemphasized.\n5. The basic recipe can then be taken in a number of flavour and presentation directions with garnishes and condiments.\n6.  Scallions, minced cucumber, bell pepper (any colour), capers, duxelles, chopped hard boiled egg (if you are leery about using raw eggs), etc. can be served on the side.\n7. An assortment of red, green and black cornichons (peppercorns) can add colour to the presentation.\n8. Greek Tzatziki (a mild dressing of yogurt and cucumber), or a light horseradish sauce will add additional zest if desired.\n9.  As with Sushi, however, be careful not to overpower the basic delicate flavour of this dish.\n10. Flatbread, lightly oiled and pan-fried, makes a nice alternative to the usual toast points or crackers. ",

I will only buy the meat from our German butcher and have him grind it. There were a couple of ingredients in this recipe that I normally don't use and I must say that they were nice additions. I don't care for egg in this so I skipped it and added finely minced onion. We served this on buttered Russian rye bread. Most German restaurants and Oktoberfests will no longer serve this, so it's nice to be able to make it at home. Delicious and thanks, Itsi.",

To my recollection, neither recipe included brandy. But both had tabasco, a couple of anchovies and capers....which I include whenever I make it.  Even back then ordering raw beef with raw egg raised eyebrows, but it was delicious, especially with a cut of beef that had some marbelling (but not too much).   I know some think you should stay away from supermarket eggs, but I think the whole raw egg fear is overkill. Yeah, you're taking risks, but you're also taking risks with raw beef.",
