I used whole jalapenos, and they were extremely hot, although the cream cheese had the effect of cooling them down. Like everyone else, I had problems with the bacon being too uncooked. Next time will try using the broiler for this. I agree with some of the previous reviewers that these would also be great with regular peppers, tomatoes, onions, or some combination of those. Will try that next time.",

I also used yellow banana peppers and only 1/2 pepper (seeds removed) per rollup which was plenty hot. I salted & peppered each slice of meat before rolling but it still lacked a little flavor. Next time will add some garlic salt. I also wrapped each rollup with 2 slices of bacon and cooked in the oven. The bacon didn't get too crispy and no one wanted to eat it that uncooked so I had to take everyones bacon and microwave it to get it crispy. Next time I will turn the broiler on for a few minutes or cook them on the grill over charcoal. Overall it was good and didn't really take too long to fix. The next day we broiled the leftovers and the bacon got crispy! VERY GOOD!",
