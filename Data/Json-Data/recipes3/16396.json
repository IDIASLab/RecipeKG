This was delicious and the chicken was juicy and tender.  I did season the chicken breasts after I took them out of the water with some garlic powder and salt. I think it would have been bland otherwise. I suggest using a good quality BBQ sauce because this will greatly affect the overall taste.  Don't use thick-cut bacon as it won't be cooked in time.  Even the regular bacon was just barely done, but still tasty!  I might suggest only simmering the chicken 8 minutes, and cooking longer in the oven to help ensure the bacon is done. You could also simmer in chicken broth, or add seasonings to the water. Or, just cook it all in the oven.  I also don't think you need the full 12oz of BBQ sauce, but use what you prefer.  Pound the chicken breast to an even thickness so it cooks evenly.  I'd definitely make this again!",
