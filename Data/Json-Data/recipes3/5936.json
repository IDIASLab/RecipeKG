You really need to let this salsa sit for about 2 hours for the mixture to blend properly. Also - one can reduce the amount of onion. It went well with a grilled chiken kabobs that were seasoned with salt and pepper. This really added the flavor to the meal. I agree with a previous reviewer - its not for everyone but I really enjoyed the unique combinations of flavors.",
