I loved the addition of bay and fresh thyme which I had not put into french onion soup before. It's worth splurging on a very good cheese for this recipe. On to the inevitable substitutions. I did not have the port so I increased the amount on white wine. I wasn't confident my bowls could be put under the broiler so I baked mine at 375 degrees for 15 minutes with fabulous results. Thanks Phil!",
