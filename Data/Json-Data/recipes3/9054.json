I made some changes according to my family's likes while keeping the balance of the original recipe in mind.  I'm sure it would have been good just as it is however if you like a little more zing, this recipe is easy to customize.  Enjoy!-- \n\nBTW,I doubled the original recipe then added another 2 eggs, another cup of bread crumbs, 1 ear of fresh corn blanched and cut off the cob, three chopped green onions, a tsp more of old bay, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, the juice of half a lemon and a 1/2 tsp of salt.  I came out with 12 patties a little smaller then an english muffin. I browned in a little bit of bacon drippings from breakfast and a pat of butter.  I served with a big wedge salad for a hot summer day supper.  I had lemon wedges, Tabasco, cocktail sauce ketchup and salt/pepper on the table.  My family devoured!!",
