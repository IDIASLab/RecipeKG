I used the larger and if I were to make this again I would use a smaller bulb or just use part of a larger bulb. However the oranges do pair well with the fennel and tone that fennel flavor down. I also used baby spinach instead of arugala. I do not recommend this. Arugala has more flavor than baby spinach. However this does make for a very pretty dish!",
