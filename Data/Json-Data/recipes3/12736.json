We really enjoyed red snapper cooked in the Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven. This is a new appliance for me and I'm still feeling my way around with it. In addition we usually cook salmon at home so I went out on a limb with the red snapper. It is a mild white-flesh fish with a lovely pinkish skin. The flavors suggested by the author are clean and light and they do not overpower this lovely fish. I served it with fresh steamed broccoli and it was a perfect companion. Thanks for the recipe!",

The flavors of lemon zest, fresh basil and fresh parsley combined with freshly crushed garlic creates a fragrant subtle depth of flavors that compliment this fish. I allowed the flavors to marinade together in the olive oil for an hour, then crushed freshly ground pepper into the marinade before brushing on both sides of the fish before placing into a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. The fish was flaky and flavorful but not overpowered.  I will try this next on Mahi. I think this marinade will work on any flaky fish. This was a great recipe we will keep as a regular in rotation.",
