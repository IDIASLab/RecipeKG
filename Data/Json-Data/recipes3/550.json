Used GOLDEN CREAM OF MUSHROOM soup and halved the recipe for 1 person. Used 3 chicken breasts based on reviews that there is alot of sauce. Heated sauce ingredients on stove. Replaced half the wine with chicken broth and realized afterwards that I did not use 1/3 but 2/3 cup. I therefore decided to just cut the chicken breasts into pieces browned them in the butter/dressing mixture (Good Seasons Cheese Garlic) added the sauce and simmered on stovetop. In lieu of the rice I used eggnoodles and omitted the second tbsp. of dressing from the noodles. This was ohhh sooo good! The wine I used was not a dry one but a bit sweet so added about 1/4 cup sour cream to offset any sweetness. Also added a tsp. of roasted chopped garlic to the sauce. Really wonderful and quick easy recipe.",

I cut this recipe in half 2 chicken breasts 1 package of cream cheese arbor mist raspberry twist wine to taste 1 can of cream of chicken italian dressing to taste white rice and some pam. I browned the chicken after spraying the pan with just the italian dressing. I then put it in an 8x8 pan already sprayed and covered with a mixture of 1 package of cream cheese arbor mist raspberry twist wine to taste 1 can of cream of chicken italian dressing to taste and about 1/2 a cup of sour cream and added some onion powder garlic powder and some basil seasoning. I baked the chicken at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. Then I made the rice like it said with the remaining dressing and cooked as the rice package said and added some more italian dressing to the rice after. We used the extra sauce from the chicken over the rice and served with some green beans (as picture shows). Hope you love this recipe as much as my fiance and I do!",

Although I didn't see any extra taste in the rice by using the remaining Italian seasonings packet - it looked pretty. Although it looks dull (being all white) - it was pretty tasty and overall we were pleased. If I made this again I might add some red bell peppers to the bake or steamed brocoli at the end to sprinkle overall for some color. Thanks Lori!",

I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken instead and it turned out fine. I also used Tastefully Simple Herb and Spinach Dip Mix instead of the Italian dressing mix because that's what I had. The chicken browned nicely in olive oil and the dip mix and it could've been eaten on it's own without the sauce! I liked this but next time I would add more seasoning to the sauce like garlic or maybe even red pepper. I like everything a little spicy. Overall it was good and I would make it again.",
