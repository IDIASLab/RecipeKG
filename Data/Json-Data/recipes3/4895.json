Although I did make a couple of adjustments: I added a bit extra green curry paste (only 'cause I like it real spicy) and anyways, I think it has alot to do with what kind/brand of paste you buy, some are just spicier than others. I also added julienned red and green bell peppers(1/2 a pepper each), omitted the corn, added a little extra ginger, added fresh squeezed lime juice of 1/4 of one lime, and 1 1/2 tablespoon of white sugar, and I used a small handful of fresh cilantro leaves instead of the basil. It was remarkably close to the taste of the green thai curry dish at my fave thai restaurant! DELICIOUS!!!",

Thanks to them I used only 1/2 tbs. of the paste and it still was pretty spicy! This recipe was about 18 dollars total if you do not have any of the ingredients. I also suggest getting jasmine rice from an asian grocery store and cooking it over the stove for about 15 minutes. The water level should be about 1 inch above the rice and cook it covered. Hope this helps! Definitely try it.",

I made it with pork instead of chicken, and it turned out great, though I'd recommend cooking the pork in a separate wok first, with the garlic & oil.  I also added potatoes to this, which I think worked out great, just make sure you boil the potatoes first to even out the cooking time.  I'm not a fan of eating bits of ginger, so I put in 5 very large slices, and fished them out later.  I also used fish sauce instead of salt, much more authentic.  And I'm confused by previous reviewsthat said they had to cut down on the spiciness; this was actually very mild curry, by any standard (wusses! LOL... either that or a huge variation in different brands of prepared green curry pastes).  I had to add in some fresh chopped hot peppers & ground pepper to really get it going.  I'm not a frequent cook, so it was a welcome relief to have such a simple recipe turn out so good; made lots and shared with others in my building, who loved it too; and then froze the rest.",
