It not only lacks flavor but when the cheese melted the entire thing seperated and looks just terrible. Don't even get me started on what my house smells like right now! All in all this recipe is in need of an overhaul. I'm so sorry...",

I don't quite agree with all the steps, and I don't use baking soda, but this is good.  My Mom added chopped green bell pepper, so that is what I do too.  Saute  the pepper in the butter before adding the flour, then proceed to make the cheese sauce which is similar to cheese sauce for mac and cheese with the addition of chopped tomatoes.  Very good over toast.  Kid friendly.",
