Corn flakes helped keep cookies from sticking even more to pan (and my fingers) but only ended up around the edges of the top of the cookie and looked funny. I baked a few without corn flakes because I ran out and didn't feel like crushing more and those were lumpy blobs once I scraped them off the cookie sheet. They took about 5 minutes longer to bake than stated and I'm not sure they were done then. I cooled them on a rack but they were still chewey and after putting them in an airtight container they're now one big messy lump. The flavor tells me this recipe may have potential but I'm not going to waste my time or ingredients figuring out how.",
