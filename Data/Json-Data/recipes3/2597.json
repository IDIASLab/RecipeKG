After testing my yeast (it was fine) and after four failed batches I tried the recipe exactly as written. Same failure. I used just 6 cups of flour but it just can't rise. It makes a crumbly-textured product that tastes okay but isn't anything like \"bread\". Ugh. I wasted so much time. If reducing the flour by 1-1/2 cups still can't make a dough that the yeast can budge then there's something wrong with this recipe.",

Also I couldn't tell if the milk is intended to be scorched (some call for that) or just brought up to temp/ increase the sugars for the yeast. Either way the milk and yeast did not rise ( the yeast is good - i just made rolls yesterday.) Also - 1 Tablespoon of salt!!! I used 2/3 of a T and the dough is very salty.  I ended up using 4 cups plus a little for the board, should have at least doubled the yeast, and next time will proof the yeast before adding to the milk and use only one teaspoon of salt. \nThe loaves are baking now.
