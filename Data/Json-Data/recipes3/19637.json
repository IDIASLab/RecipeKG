Veggies I used were: Frozen 1cup broccoli 1cup cauliflower 1/2cup edemame 1/2 cup 1/2cup green beans 1/4 cup corn and 2 med fresh carrots. Used 1 large onion and about 3/4cup of shredded lite cheddar. also used about 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. After sauteeing 3 cloves garlic and onions Cooked it in a toaster oven at 375F for about 25 min. Walnuts were yummy as they toasted as it all cooked... Smells very yummy while cooking! 2 of us ate about 3/4 of it topped on a bit of spinach fettucine and multigrain spaghetti. Very good. Think I will experiment with different nuts and veggies. Very healthy vitamin wise compared to boiling your veggies;)Added a bit of parsley and black pepper to the top.. I also sprayed the bottom of my pan with olive oil but dont think it was necessary. Thank you!",
