Although, the recipe my family has is a little bit different than this one...\r\n\r\nTips - Mix the margarine/butter and graham cracker crumbs together to make a firmer \"crust\". (My family also melts the margarine in the pan in the oven.)\r\n\r\n- Pour the condensed milk on the graham cracker crumbs BEFORE adding the other ingredients. It seems to make everything stick together better and it makes it so much more presentable!\r\n\r\n- Use more than 1 cup of chocolate chips. Especially if you're a chocolate lover. 1 cup just isn't enough!\r\n\r\nAlso, I like the recipe better without the nuts. They seem to kind of take away from the other flavors. But I'm not a big fan of nuts in desserts to begin with.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy these as much as I do! :)",

Pour Sweetened Condensed Milk over crust, then layer with remaining ingredients.  Makes it all stick together better.

I made a few modifications after reading the reviews - I used chocolate graham crackers and doubled the graham cracker/butter base since a few of the reviewers said the base was a little skimpy as it is - I liked the thickness of the base but would probably use less butter next time.  I put the milk on top of the base since other reviewers said it made for a more attractive bar (I might do half under and half over next time though, to help the toppings stick better) and instead of just semi-sweet chocolate chips I mixed white chocolate chips and chocolate/peanut butter swirled chips. Since the base was thicker it took longer to cook.  I check them after 25 minutes and they were not even close to being done so I covered it with foil to keep the coconut from burning and had to bake it for about 20 additional minutes.  They were awesome once the cooled and set up a bit, I'll definitely make this again!",

At the bakery we used white chocolate, milk chocolate, and butterscotch chips, coconut, walnuts, and sweetened condensed milk. I have also tried peanut butter chips, almonds, and M&M baking pieces, all with great success. The only trick to this recipe is not baking it too long or the sugars in the milk will harden after cooling. Gooey-ness is the key!",
