I took the advice of other reviews and used 1/4 cup of apple sauce and 1/4 cup of coconut oil. I still used vanilla extract despite one of the comments and would do it again because i think it needs it. I also added a bit of cinnamon because i love the combination with bananas. I was pleasantly surprised that I did not need to add sugar! For those who like it sweeter if you add some syrup or confectioners sugar it's just right. Definitely a keeper!",
