The one thing that was slightly different only because at last minute realized I didn't have whole tomates but rather crushed w/basil already in the 28 ounce can I had...and based on that, my batch was beautifully seasoned. Sooo if the recipe is slightly bland..just add a few dashes of dried oregano. My Ninja food processor is a champ and I measured with all ingredients and the size of batch it makes, to be about 72 ounces total. I love it. This makes a super easy recipe, fast with little prep work, delish & go to recipe, if you're not sure what to have for a quick lunch. I couldn't be more pleased with my results.",

I liked the food processor suggestion except that this recipe is too big to do it in the processor without switching out contents so you should 1/2 to 3/4 it for that. Even though I wasn't crazy about it as gazpacho it did end up being a fantastic base for a chicken mole type simmer sauce so I might come back around to it for that reason.",
