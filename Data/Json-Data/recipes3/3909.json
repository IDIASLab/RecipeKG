I made this twice with different curry powders and the difference was night and day. The \"national brand\" of curry powder you'll find in a regular grocery store made this taste like celery seed and did NOT compliment the other flavors. It's worth the extra legwork and money to find a good authentic curry. When I used \"real\" curry powder this recipe was stellar! Had trouble finding a dish to go with it though would like to hear others' meal ideas.",

I just remade it using apricot nectar as directed (I must have just used apricot preserves last time) and I must say I liked it MUCH better with the preserves instead. The nectar flattened the flavor out. Nevertheless I did double the sauce so I had enough which I drizzled over jasmine rice boiled in apple juice instead of water with a crushed cashew garnish.",
