They have a delicate black raspberry liqueur scent once iced, and are beautiful as well, with a shiny glossy finish. You will need a heart-shaped cookie cutter. If you like, sprinkle the frosting with rainbow non-pareils, silver balls, or red sugar. Frosting dries to a high sheen within a half hour or so.",

I don't think I beat the egg whites long enough because it was not very fluffy; regardless I added some more powdered sugar and it thickened up fine. I doubled the recipe (made a lot) and all were gone in about two days. Everyone liked them and they looked great.",

It was like trying to roll out peanut butter and cut it into shapes and transfer to a cookie sheet. And that was after refrigerating for a few hours. I didn't get to try the icing which sounded like the highlight of the cookie but I would say if you want to try the icing make a different sugar cookie recipe first. This one just does not work.",
