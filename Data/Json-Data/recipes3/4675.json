I cut the recipe in half and added just a bit of milk to the eggs to get them nice and fluffy. I knew just by looking at the recipe that the amount of dried basil would be too much and since I didn't want to ruin this I used a bit of fresh basil instead. I scrambled the eggs a bit then added the rest of the ingredients vs. mixing everything together. I also added in some cherry tomatoes cut in half and upped the feta a bit. This only needed just a bit of fresh cracked black pepper for seasoning. This was great tucked into some flour tortillas for a breakfast wrap!",

Like many other reviewers have mentioned cutting back from 1 tablespoon of dry basil to 1 teaspoon helps to not overpower the dish with the basil flavor. I also added the feta cheese in later when the egg was on the pan cooking as to not have it lost amidst the egg when it was cooking.",
