The recipe is worth making, but I recommend cutting the shrimp up and then letting it marinate all day.",

We were a little leary about just using the lime juice to cook so I added the shrimp to boiling water for about 2 min then put them in an ice bath before chopping up and adding it to the lime juice. I then let it 'cook' in the lime juice for about 30 min. I followed the recipe as written from there. I served the ceviche on fresh corn tortillas That were baked till crunchy in the oven. Excellent recipe I know this will become a fresh healthy staple in our house!",
