As always, I adjusted the recipe according to what was in the cupboards, i.e. white wine instead of vermouth, small onion inteaad of shallots, double cream not whipping cream. but it made an average roast dinner that much more special. I also roasted the vegetables in the same dish as the chicken; the carrots tasted wonderful! \nI would probably increase the amounts of the sauce if I was making it again, it was so delicious 2 of us had no problem finishing it all off!

I couldn't decide if I wanted to make Spicy Rapid Roast Chicken or this - so I combined them, kind of. I used the recipe here with the directions there pretty much. :/ :D Using a 4 & a half pound chicken, I combined a 1/4t salt, 1/4t pepper & 1T olive oil & brushed that on. I put 1/4t salt & 1/4t pepper inside. Since I didn't have shallots, or the desire to go out & try to find some, I subbed 1/4c minced onion & 3 cloves minced garlic with the vermouth. 450 oven for 30 & 400 for 60. It was nicely browned & slightly crispy. Next time, I'll take it off for a bit near the end. It was too salty, too. I'll probably half the amounts I tried. To save calories (big laugh), I used half & half. It tasted good, but didn't thicken. I also didn't feel like crushing peppercorns so used coarse ground black pepper. It was fine. I don't see how a tablespoon of pepper couldn't be a typo. I thought it was 1 tsp so tried 3/4t. Although it didn't thicken for (hot) dinner, it thickened up fine for (cold) lunch. I poured the sauce in with the chicken meat. Next day, it was quite yummy. I added some chicken salad ingredients with chopped apples. 'Put it on French bread & had a good time. :D It was worth waiting a day to have. :)",

My husband couldn't stop! I cooked it in a roasting pan with a tight fitting lid. I think this is much better than foil as it really seals in the moisture. I had PLENTY of drippings left for the gravey. It WAS very salty so next time I will rub the chicken with a very small amount of salt and I think that will fix it. Also instead of heavy cream I used fat-free milk. I heated one cup in the microwave until it was steaming (watch it closely). I then immediately whisked in about five tbsp flour one at a time and then added this to the reduced drippings. I got a very smooth gravy which was not too rich. You're not going to get the thickness this way that you would with heavy cream but it wasn't watery and tasted great and certainly was much more healthy. I will absolutely make this again.

I only used a teaspoon of peppercorns worried that they would turn off certain picky eaters in my family. I dissolved a teaspoon of flour into half and half before adding to juice -- it thickened up like gravy which was very good.",
