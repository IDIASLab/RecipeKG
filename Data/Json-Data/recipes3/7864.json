This is a definite keeper - these went great with grilled onions and Leslie's Saltly Grilled Potatoes from this site. Thanks Rocky.",

After pulling the steak off the grill, letting it sit for five minutes and tasting it all I can say is, this is absolutely wonderful, a fantastic complement to steak on the grill. The rub enhanced that beef flavor a man looks for without being overpowering.  I would make one adjustment.  As some reviewers who preceded me indicated, I would cut back on the salt. Beyond that, this is something I will use again, and often.  Special note: for those of you who love strip steaks and your significant other likes tenderloin, using a porterhouse and cutting the tenderloin off, cooking it separately (as shown in my photo), is an easy way to satisfy different tastes and different cooking temperatures.",

I pan fried the steaks in a grill pan about 8 minutes each side and then put 1/2 a tablespoon of butter on top to melt when done. I served it with sauted onions and baked potatoes. I will definitely be using this rub again - maybe it will even make my London Broil taste better!",
