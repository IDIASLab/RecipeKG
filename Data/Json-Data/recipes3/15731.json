Instead of the last step of placing them between sheets of wax paper or other, I just put the mix straight in to muffin tins. They come out perfect! I added a bit of dried herbs for color and I used just a teeny pinch of garlic powder instead of half teaspoon as I do not like them too garlicky. Just my own opinion. I may add onion powder next time instead. Or both! Luv these. I also added a tablespoon of parm. Thanks for sharing",
