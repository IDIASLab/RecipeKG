We're usually not fans of ground turkey- or any turkey for that matter - and this was best ground turkey recipe ever. I made a double batch and needed the 8qt instant pot and kept the pepper at heaping 1/2 tsp and the seasoning salt at 2 tsp instead of doubling it all and it was very good.",

I didn't read the author's note at the bottom till it was too late, and I spent some time fishing out the cauliflower pieces to put in the blender.  Other than that everything was really easy!  I'm going to add some pickle juice next time to add more dill flavor.  Also I used the whole carton (32 oz.) of beef broth which turned out great.  It needed the extra liquid in my opinion.  Will definitely make again.",
