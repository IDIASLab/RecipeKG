I'll admit that I used more hot pepper sauce than the recipe called for but the sauce turned out great. I really liked the flavor the crackers gave however they did hold their crunch. By the time the tomatoes were cool enough to eat the coating was already starting to get soggy. This was a nice change but I will be going back to my cornmeal/flour mix. I will most definitely use this sauce recipe again. It complimented the tang of the tomatoes perfectly.",
