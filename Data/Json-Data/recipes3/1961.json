I used the pre-melted envelopes of unsweetened chocolate and added, I think,  two or three envelopes beyond what the recipe called for, not that it wasn't good without it - for the cake I used it on I just wanted it a deeper chocolate.  Leave out the chocolate, add a little less milk, and you've got a great vanilla buttercream!  I would double this recipe for a 9x13 cake or for a 9\" layer cake and make even more if you want ample to pipe decorations.",
