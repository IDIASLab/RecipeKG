Great for students or those waiting on their kitchen to finally finish being remodeled.  It's fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside and topped with pizza sauce and cheese.  It's tasty, cheap, quick, and easy.  You'll need a toaster oven and a microwave.",

Very tasty lunch for the kids would be good with some cooked sausage or bacon on top too.",
