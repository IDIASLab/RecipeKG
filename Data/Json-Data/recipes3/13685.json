After cooling, I picked up the parchment paper at the sides, and set it on the counter.  Then I cut it into strips.

I didn't have fresh mozzarella so I used the grated stuff that comes in a can.  I also  threw in some  feta cheese.  I put in some spices called \"pizza seasoning\" into the crust.  I used squeeze garlic verses the garlic powder.  we had some cooked hamburger and tiny pepperoni so I threw that on for a topping.  Even my hubby who is disgusted by these type of bread replacement recipes liked them!  This will be our new Friday night pizza go-to.",

My mom said it was tastier than some pizzas she's had from restaurants. I made it as written except cut the mozzarella in the \"dough\" to a half cup, and spread it (on parchment) like a traditional round pizza instead of using a muffin tin. After 15 minutes of cooking, I flipped it and cooked it an additional 5 minutes. Then I added the toppings and cooked long enough to melt the cheese on top. I felt the other ingredients and spices were perfect as written. As a second option, we have used some cheddar in the topping cheese and used sweet peppers and onions...yum!",
