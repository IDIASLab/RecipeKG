I cooked it in a skillet and served it on a sandwich thin bread/bun topped with a slice of provolone cheese. It didn't need any condiments or toppings, this was great all by itself. I think garlic mayo would be great with this burger though. The raisins plumped up and weren't chewy at all and worked well in this recipe. Sounds weird, tastes great. I'm glad I tried this.

The boys couldn't get past the idea of raisins in a burger so I soaked them in hot water until plump then tossed them in a food processor along with the onion and 3 cloves of garlic. Instead of S&P I used a tsp. each of steak seasoning and Italian seasoning (for this much meat you'd have to use much more at least 2-3 tsps. of each) and switched the Worcestershire for Dijon mustard. Topped my burger with provolone (as per recommendations) and steak sauce (Kikkoman's which has an applesauce base that went well with the raisins- Not sure if most other brands would work equally well but thought I'd throw this out there for us folk that like sauce on a burger). This needs a 'crunch' factor like a traditional burger gets from tomato or pickles. I see alot of potential for this (pickled apple slices anyone?) and will play around with this in the future. Served this with \"Waldorf Salad with Walnut Oil Vinaigrette\" from AR.",
