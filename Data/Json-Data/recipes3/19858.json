I used the Pillsbury crust - to DIE FOR!!  I also added some garlic powder - not a lot - but I put it in about everything I make.  I also added some dried onions - next time I think I will try to saute real onion with the chicken and brown them both a little bit before putting them in.  I also don't have a lot of canned veggies - my husband only likes frozen - so I threw a can of corn in with some frozen veggies that I barely cooked and drained them.  I used one can of cream of chicken, and the other can was a creamy herbed chicken (Campbell's).  I wasn't too sure of that, but it was great!!  I followed the directions on the crust package to cover the rim of the crust after 10 minutes - my husband was asking for leftovers the next night!!!! This was so good even my picky 4 and 2 year olds ate most of it!!  Thank you for this MUST HAVE!!",

My wife and I ate over half the pie at one setting. She said it was better than any pot pie she had ever eaten. The only things I changed were  adding a little chopped up onion and  I used potato soup instead of chicken soup because I love potato soup.  I highly recomend this as a great tasting meal in itself!",

I didn't have two cans of Cream of Chicken soup so I just used one and one can of cream of mushroom. I finely chopped half an onion and two stalks of celery and sauteed them in a couple tablespoons of butter until soft. I also added about 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. I added some thyme rosemary parsley and a touch of sage for added flavor. I also used frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned. Delicious!!",

This one sounds good, but looks so simple that you wonder... Wonder no more - you have got to try it.  It is so simple, that you can make it on a work night and seem like you slaved all day.  My husband raves - and that is rare. He tells people that they just HAVE to come over to try my pot pie!  If they only knew how easy it is.  Especially if you cook the chicken the day before or at least have it thawed out (which I never seem to do).  I use frozen veggies, store bought pie crusts, and add a few tablespoons of dried minced onion. Oh and about 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  Thats it.  It's great as written as well.  But it's so simple that you can play around with it.  One day I only had 1 can of cream of chicken.  So I used that and one can of cream of mushroom.  Still delish.  You would be hard pressed to ruin this.  So give it a try!!",
