The starter was not liquid enough to \"pour\" as the recipe stated; I went ahead and used all the starter and made the bread using a little more WW flour than stated. I used a pan of water in the bottom of my oven instead of spraying the loaf with water, and the bread turned out very crusty, with a chewy interior. It does need more salt, because it is a little bland. I will tinker with this recipe, because it is worth trying again. Thanks for an adventure Chris!",

Then I thought about it and I realized that many people have trouble with breads because of the chlorine and flouride in their water. That said I used filtered tap water and AP flour because that is what I had on hand. I follow the instructions and made a lovely biga and waited impatiently for 12 hours to use it. The dough came together beautifully. Without adding any additional flour it was slightly sticky but I decided to see how it felt after the first rise. I cloaked it very lightly with flour before punching down and from that point on it was perfect. The extra rise helped the flavor develop and it baked into the most beautiful boule. I tossed 4 ice cubes into the bottom of my oven at the start of baking and the crust was chewy and crusty. I refrigerated the remaining biga and will be making another loaf tomorrow. Very nice recipe Chris!......9/26/09 UPDATE: I just made another loaf using the reserved starter. This time I used 1 cup whole wheat 1 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup rye. It is slightly denser but still has a great crust and still came together almost effortlessly.",

For the starter I just put the ingredients in a bowl and stirred for 5 minutes with a fork. I covered it loosely with plastic wrap and left it on the table overnight. It almost spilled out of my bowl but I caught it in time so make sure you use a big enough bowl because it grows. The next day I scooped out the starter that I needed and added the rest of the water and yeast let that sit for 5 minutes then added the rest of the ingredients. I thought the flavor was fine as is. And it sure didn't last long around here. I think I'm going to make it again tomorrow. I was curious about how to deal with freezing the starter but AR has a great article on it if you need more info. Thanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Very good! I don't have a bread machine consequently I used regular \"active dry\" yeast & made this by hand. The yeast was first dissolved for a couple of minutes in water which was lukewarm because of the cold weather & kitchen. The flour was then stirred in. The sponge (\"biga\") was covered with a damp cloth. Later I again added more lukewarm water to first dissolve the extra yeast while softening the 1/3 cup of sponge/biga. After stirring in the rest of the ingredients I beat the dough with a wooden spoon for 2-3 minutes covered it (with a damp cloth) & let rise. (Again the kitchen was cold so this took longer than usual.) The dough was very soft - probably because I spooned the flour into a measuring cup & leveled it off which gave me 3 Tblsp. less flour than if I'd simply scooped the flour with the meas. cup. So the dough was so soft that it had to go into a 9\" pie plate for it's 2nd rising & baking instead of on the baking stone as I'd planned. I spritzed water onto the bread as directed but this deflated the bread dough a little - it is possible that the bread was slightly overrisen; between that & the spritzing the deflation wasn't surprising. Still it was a good bread with a faint sourdough flavor & a very crusty crust. I will make it again & will add a pinch more salt. If you're afraid of it being bland simply add a little more salt.",

I made the starter and had it sit out for 12 hours to then have a change in plans and not make the bread that day. So I froze it for about 4 days let it thaw in the fridge for a day and a half. Then I put the ingredients listed (plus another 3/4 tsp of salt) all in my bread machine with the dough setting on a delay start. So when I got home from work the dough was ready to be formed on my pan. Also a trick I learned to making crusty bread was that I left a pan with water in the oven through the whole process starting with the pre-heat. PERFECTO!",

Make sure you have nothing at all to do for 24 straight hours also please be sure that your house is the perfect temperature for dough to rise. I followed this recipe perfectly... although I did allow a bit more time than suggested to allow the dough to rise. I was baking this bread for a bread pudding recipe. The bread turned out very solid although the inside was perfectly soft. My bread pudding recipe calls for crust removed so thankfully I think I'll be okay!",
