I rolled the dough very thin (1/8 inch or less) cut them in small squares with my pizza cutter and put them on a floured cookie sheet to dry all afternoon. I let my chicken broth come to a boil and added the dumplings then turned down the heat, covered the pan and let them cook for about 8 min. They were just like grandma's!! Nice and thin and tender. Not gummy or doughy at all. I added my chicken after the dumplings were cooked. I thickened the broth with alittle flour mixed with cold water and served with mashed potatoes and biscuts. What a wonderful dinner on a cold night.",

(so i wasn't afraid to be a veggie stealing the dumpling recipe from \"chicken and dumplings\")  super easy recipe, made it in a jiffy, then got to focus all my creativity on the soup.  i felt motivated to experiment around with what i had in the kitchen.  didn't have any broth or stock, so i improvised my own base (i don't ever homecook soup other than miso).  i heated some butter in a large pot, added in my chopped red onion, some shredded carrots, cremini mushroom chunks, & chive.  then salted, garlic powdered, and sugared, (something i learned from asian cooking) four cups of water, & a quick splash of milk for some opacity.  i cut my  dumplings pretty slopily, so some were a lot bigger than others, but they all tasted uniform.  you know when they are done, because they ALL float.  before serving, i added some chopped green onion, and enoki mushrooms.  turned out to be a nice somewhat light & fresh, but very hearty soup.  presentation was nice in a glass bowl.  i recommend serving immediately; if you wait too long to eat the soup... the dumplings suck in a bunch of liquid, and become much more dense & gummy (which isn't too bad, but i did like the fluffier version better, it went better with my light soup)",

We grew up with dumplings being light and fluffy. These dumplings are heavy and tastless. Maybe I didn't let them dry enough. How dry do they have to be? I wonder if adding baking powder would help them rise.Would this give them the fluffy texture and help them to take on the flavor of the stew? If anyone tries it please post the results.",
