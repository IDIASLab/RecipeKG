                "reviewBody": "I've been eating this dip practically since birth and I was thrilled to see a recipie for it online. The inventor of this recipie was a man named Harold Miklethwaite. He was a Paris trained chef who owned and operated Harold's restaurant in Portsmouth Ohio from the early 60's until his death I believe in the mid 90's. Harold had a wicked sense of humor and he often said that his lips looked like a ducks bill. The logo for his restaurant was a duck in a tux, so naturally a good name for his dip was duck butter which was always the first thing the waiter placed on your table with a big basket of Melba toast. I moved to California in the late 70's, but always look back upon my youth fondly in southern Ohio and the great meals from Harold's restaurant.\n\nEdit: As somebody else mentioned it makes a great spread on sandwiches. I made French dip roast beef sandwiches and it was outstanding on them. I've also tried it on grilled burgers and the result was equally as delicious. You can leave the salt out if you want because the ingredients and whatever you put the spread on will also be salty. It is very strong with just crackers, but the flavor on a sandwich or burger is perfect.",
