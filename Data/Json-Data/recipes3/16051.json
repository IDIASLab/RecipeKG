I also had a 25 oz bottle of passata so I used the whole thing because I like plenty of sauce. I made this with half scamorza half mozzarella and it was delicious! Oh and I was also running low on olive oil so I used barely any oil and a hot cast iron skillet for the initial cooking step. I think I used 1/2 teaspoon salt in the sauce and that - combined with coarse kosher salt sprinkled on the eggplant plus the salty cheeses was perfect for me. Great dish.",
