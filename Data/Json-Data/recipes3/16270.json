I made a few small modifications: used chicken breasts cut into bite-sized peices, only used 2 potatoes, threw in a few handfuls of frozen peas and a diced onion, subbed stock for water, and I threw in a pinch of poultry seasoning.  I also added a little marjoram to the Bisquick before cooking the dumplings. It was really really good.  Thanks for the recipe!!",
