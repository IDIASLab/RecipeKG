On that note, the recipe does not call to drain the canned tomatoes but you need to or it will be even more soupy. Flavor is good but this recipe needs some tweaks. I did add some chopped cilantro and that was a nice touch. Loved the freshness of this but you really do need to cut the liquid down.",
