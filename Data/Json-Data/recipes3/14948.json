They loved them so much that they actually paid more attention to the wings than the game for 15 minutes! For milder sauce use mild chili sauce instead of Thai. Serve with celery and ranch or blue cheese dressing.",

They came out a real dark rich color and looked as if they had been coated is some type of thick sticky sauce even though I hadn't put anything on them yet. The tequila really came through and was the most potent but you could taste the other flavors as well. Now about the sauce. I am confused as to what you mean by Thai style chili sauce. When I see that I think of the pinkish sauce sold in the Asian food aisle but it barely has any heat at all so maybe you are referring to a Sriracha type sauce instead? I'm not sure but I think either would actually work fine on this recipe. These were good and turned out very pretty.",
