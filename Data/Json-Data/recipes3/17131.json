As previous reviewer suggested, I partially cooked the harder vegetables (carrots, onions, celery, pepper) very quickly over high heat and removed them from the pan.  I turned down the heat and cooked the chicken until almost cooked but not browned, turning once.  Then added the vegetables back into the pan, added finely shredded cabbage and stirred until it was turning  green, then added liquids as per recipe,, brought it to a simmer then added snow peas.  Cashews were added last just before serving.   Texture was perfect with softer chicken, slightly crunchy veg, and crunchy cashews.  Yum. Served over jasmine rice.",

Most important thing is to have a big wok (14 inches) I use a 14 inch wok for just my husband and myself.  Years ago I took a cooking class on a Junk in Hong Kong harbor and was taught that the secret to a successful stir fry was to use the biggest wok you can find, then a high temperature so you can stir with abandon.   Have every ingredient lined up in proper order for how fast it cooks and spice to taste!  Rarely does a main dish ever take over 7 minutes to cook, start to finish.   If you're doing multiple dishes, do the ones that \"keep\" first.    Always remember:  a 10 inch wok is only good as a planter!",
