I made this with a couple of changes I used lite margerine and I used 1% milk only didn't add creme at end also could not find celery flakes so I used 1 tea of finely chopped celery I also used red onion as that was what I had and simmered soup for about 1/2 hr then cooled and reheated it later for dinner. This was yummy and I think fairly light I had a couple friends for dinner and they loved it. I will make this again thanks",

I used can lobster as I could not bear to use fresh lobster in a soup unless it was left over, which never happens at our house.  I added worcestershire sauce, sherry, Old Bay, white pepper and paprika.  I substituted heavy cream for the light cream.  My only wish is that I had written down the amounts.  I just did it to taste, and it was \"knock your socks off\" good!  Thank you Dorothy for such an EXCELLENT recipe.",

I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added 3 tbsp of sherry (Harvey's Bristol Cream - don't use cheap cooking sherry) 2 tsp Worcestershire 1/2 tsp paprika and a \"pass\" of Konrico (kind of like Ole Bay). Also - I'm cheap so I got a pound of shrimp and 2 small lobster tails. I did step 1 but just added the shrimp. Once the shrimp was cooked I put it all in the blender (2-3 ladles at a time) so the shrimp would be like tiny shreds of lobster. Put it all back in the pot added the cut up (small bit sized pieces) lobster tail. I forgot to add the cream - with the sherry you don't need it.",
