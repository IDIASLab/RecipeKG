I needed to bring something for a multicultural potluck and thought \"well how hard could momo's be?\" The plate emptied lightning fast and everyone raved about them. Used sausage meat because I couldn't find ground pork. I also cooked them in a frying pan with a little olive oil (5 min uncovered 5 min covered w/ out turning) because I didn't have anything to steam them in. Yum. The dipping sauce was perfect. I used a hot red pepper in it. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!",

The wrappers became very soggy... Next time I will cook the filling first wrap it then pan fry it or something... And I might use ground beef instead just for kicks.",

I cooked these like traditional pot stickers since I don't have a steamer.. a bit of oil to pan cooked covered for 5 minutes.. added a bit of water covered again for 4-5 more minutes. The only change I would make next time is in the filling. For me it needed to be less meaty not as firm so I would add more veggies or a few panko crumbs to give the filling a lighter texture",

Wasn't sure what type of dumpling wrapper to use but saw many people online suggest Wonton wrappers so I chose those. I pre-cooked my filling bc I've always found that thinner dumpling wrappers don't do well with all that extra moisture and the end result is better looking. Looked BAD steamed so I fried them instead. Dipping sauce was too chunky and had to add water and take an immersion blender to it to get the right consistency. Make sure to add salt and taste test cooked filling! In the future I would add different spices some heat and put a roasted red pepper in with the dipping sauce. Could definitely use some changes.",

I tried steaming them with the attatchment (as suggested in the recipe) and they stuck to the metal ripping open as I tried to take them out... not to mention that I could only fit about 5 in the steamer without letting them touch meaning it took about 2 hours just to cook the dumplings. I tried boiling them and they got extremely soggy so even the ones that didn't open in the pot ripped when handling. If I make these again I'll try making them in a pan (as pictured).",
