I did tweak the recipe a bit to meet our needs: I used about 1.5 cups of leftover shredded eye round roast beef and white onions. Since the meat was already cooked I simply saut\u00e9ed a few minutes in the spices before moving on to the next step. I realized we didn't have Old Bay belatedly so I subbed a creole seasoning instead (and used a lot more than \"4 pinches; probably closer to 2-3 tsps). At the last minute I realized we had a handful of shredded Italian blend cheese that needed to be used so I stirred that into the sauce as well. This came together in less than 15 minutes and was a very satisfying meal. THANKS for the recipe!",
