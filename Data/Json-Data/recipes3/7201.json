I have to comment on the reviewer who said to substitute cornmeal for grits because they were the same thing.  They're not! (I'm a southerner).  It's true that both are made from corn but they are ground and processed completely differently and often made from different parts of the corn kernel.  Supermarket cornmeal is much more finely ground; boiling it up will basically give you polenta.  It's good, but that's not what the recipe calls for.  Grits are much more coarsely ground and have a distinctive chewiness when cooked.  ",

I'm wondering if some people's turned out runny because the recipe calls for 4 cups of stock to 1 cup of grits. I just followed the directions for the grits on the box and it only called for 3 cups of liquid. I also drained the tomatoes & chilies. For presentation, I think I'd prefer a \"deconstructed\" version of this recipe, but for a casual meal with family, a one-pan recipe is the way to go.",

Directions on the grits package say cook five minutes but for a true southern grits texture cook 20 minutes stirring often or they will stick to the botton of pan, and be lumpy. One review says no need to bake.  Don't skip this important step.. The flavors will not come together without baking.  Thanks William for a super recipe.",

The only thing I can suggest for those who think it is a little runny is to drain the tomatoes and green chilies before adding to the mixture, or you could use Rotel tomatoes and green chilies.  They work even better.  Then it is perfect. The recipe didn't specify to do that.",
