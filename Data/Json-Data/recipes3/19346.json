I only had half the amount of rosemary called for, so I added some poultry seasoning, which worked well. I marinated the tenderloins all day. Also, I followed the advice of the recipe and served it with cranberry chutney, also from this site. Yummmmmmm....",

And the taste of soy was overpowering. I couldn't figure out how to salvage it, so I threw it out and did something entirely different with the tenderloins. So glad I tasted the marinade before putting it on the meat. This is one of those very rare times that I have a significant difference in opinion from the majority reviewers. I was counting on this recipe's working for me, b/c I was serving it to guests. Oh, well! Still glad I tried it.",

I say that because I had my doubts when I was reading the recipe but I tried it because of all the excellent reviews and they were right.   Based on other reviews the only change I made was to reduce the rosemary to 1 tsp and add 1 tsp of poultry seasoning.  I used a package of 1-1/4 lbs turkey tenderloins and marinated them overnight.  The turkey had a great flavor.  It did however take a few minutes longer to broil but it was definitely worth the wait.",
