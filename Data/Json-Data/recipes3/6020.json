It's pretty good as a base as written; we had it with grilled shrimp skewers and it made a nice relatively light dinner. The second time I added red bell pepper and onions along with more garlic. We had it with shrimp again mainly because it's what we had on hand. It was a bit heartier with the extra veggies and since I gave the onions a good long browning time that helped boost the flavor. It's still not a high-flavor dish but it's tasty and a good way to get the veggies in. You could probably adapt this to whatever vegetables you have on hand and it would still be good.",

Thickened the sauce with a small amount of cornstarch in the milk. Reduced the amount of pasta by half and served over angelhair because I love it. It was nice filling. Would add a lot more zucchini in the future. Thank you so much Senorita!",
