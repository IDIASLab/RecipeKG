The one complaint I have about the recipe is the ingredients list 1 tsp each of salt & pepper and the recipe doesn't tell you what to do with them. I added them to sauce while it was reducing and that worked out well for me. Maybe that's why other reviewers thought the sauce was bland - it would have been without the S&P. I thought the consistency of the sauce was perfect like gravy. I didn't serve with rice I did pasta with tomato sauce instead and it didn't really go well with the chicken. Next time I will serve with garlic mashed potatoes - it would be fantastic with the sauce!",

Instead of following the recipe directions exactly I cooked the chicken removed it to a warmer just before finishing deglazed the pan and proceeded with the sauce directions. When the sauce was reduced to just the right consistency (coated the back of a spoon) I popped the chicken breasts under the broiler to crisp the skin. Pretty plating helped me to avoid mushing the crisp skin: layer the sauce over the plate add mashed potatoes slightly off center prop the chicken up against the potatoes and drizzle a little extra sauce over the potatoes. Garnish with chopped fresh scallion and some smoked paprika and you've got a winner!",

I also added some sliced mushrooms that I needed to use up. All I can say is wow. I may try boneless skinless chicken breasts next time though. I feel like the bone and the skin are not crucial although they probably do add a lot of flavor. SO GOOD!!! Thanks so much for the recipe.",
