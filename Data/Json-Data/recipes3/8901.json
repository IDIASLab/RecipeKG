Some of the best bean salads I know of happen to be very simple as well so the lack of ingredients didn't surprise me. However this bean salad is BLAND. I am not posting a photo because my \"simple\" salad turned out to be a tad more complex - I kept adding different ingredients and herbs in order to salvage the salad to no avail. Don't make this salad - there are so many better ones.",
