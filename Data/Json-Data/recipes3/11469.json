I boiled the egg the way I always do: rolling boil for 5 mins turn off heat and leave pot as-is for another 5-6 minutes. Plunge egg into ice water for a few minutes. I sliced the egg crosswise into five pieces and fried them for about 2 minutes per side over med-high. Smashed some peppercorns sprinkled on top. Yummy! The only thing I would change is the amount of butter--I didn't need as much as the recipe calls for and had to dab the egg slices with a napkin before eating.",

Interesting idea, but for me the frying didn't impart that much flavour, and I would much prefer soft boiled eggs or actual fried eggs instead. My 2 year old stole them off my plate though, so nothing wasted.  On the positive side, this gave me the chance to try steaming my eggs in my Instant Pot pressure cooker which I've been wanting to do. The eggs cooked quickly and peeled so easily.",
