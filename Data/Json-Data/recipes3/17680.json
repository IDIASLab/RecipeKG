This recipe can be made with regular flour or with a gluten-free flour mix, along with basic ingredients you can already find in your kitchen. My husband absolutely loves it and it is the perfect alternative to a night in with take-out. Best served with steamed rice, broccoli, carrots, and water chestnuts.

I followed the instructions, except I left out the extra salt (I didn\u2019t have low-sodium soy sauce, so I didn\u2019t need more salt) and used a smaller amount of red pepper flakes. The texture of the chicken  is wonderful. Each piece of chicken has sauce that clings to it. I was wary of the cooking technique, but I\u2019m glad I followed the instructions. I will add more honey next time since I would have liked it a bit sweeter, though.",
