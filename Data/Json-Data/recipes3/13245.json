Instead of cooking it on the stovetop and then putting everything in the oven I just put all the ingredients in a roasting pan seasoned it and baked it at 375 for about 1 1/2 hours; and added the raisins at the end. I also added a little cinnamon garlic and left out the cilantro and prunes. The recipe did not state when to put in the chicken stock so I simply poured it over the vegetables before baking. There's a whole lot of flavor in this dish and it's fairly easy to put together. Thank you!",
