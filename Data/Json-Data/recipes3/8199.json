I omited the sage and oregano cut the allspice to 1/2 teaspoon and only added juice of one lime glad I did more on that later. I simmered the chicken broth and spices a total of 2 1/2 hrs to meld the flavors. Tasted and way too acidic/sour. At that point I added three cans navy beans and two heaping tablespoons of brown sugar to counter act the sour and add a touch of sweetness. Worked like a charm. Then I simmered over an hour to get this from soup to chili consistency. The result was very tasty. I enjoyed trying this thanks for your submission.",

I also added some chopped green pepper. The blend of spices worked wonderfully. Mine actually cooked up pretty thick in the 45 min so I added about 8oz of water with the beans. It still had a wonderful flavor! Great recipe!",
