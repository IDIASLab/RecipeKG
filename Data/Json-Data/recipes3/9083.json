I only had about 8oz. of spaghetti so I adjusted accordingly still using one whole packet of the dry Italian dressing mix (I did omit the extra salt). At the very end I mixed in a bit of grated Romano cheese and that added a nice touch. I really liked that this only used a few staples that I always have on hand...I will be making this again!
