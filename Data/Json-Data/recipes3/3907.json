Urban-chic name: \"Squid-Ink Pasta with Pink Gorgonzola Sauce.\" This recipe sets up high expectations immediately -- and the dish delivers deliciously. The hardest part about preparing this is finding squid-ink pasta which of course tastes nothing like squid. It's worth the effort though -- sans black pasta it's just Pasta with Pink Sauce. (A rich full-bodied pink sauce admittedly... but the dish just won't present as dramatically as it can.) That said... some people (like my dear but daunted dad) simply will not accept unusually colored food no matter how tasty. In that case you might want to go the uncolored pasta route and dress the plate up with say fan-shaped strawberry garnishes or a little unexpected something else. When I make this dish again I might stir in some pine nuts for texture but otherwise wouldn't change a thing. And that includes the pasta color!;)",
