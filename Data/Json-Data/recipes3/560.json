But I wanted to say that the addition of dry onion soup mix made the quiche phenomenal. I used 6 oz of chopped cooked chicken breast about a cup of lightly steamed chopped broccoli only 1 cup of cheese (cheddar) 3 eggs 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup heavy cream. I only used half the package of onion soup mix which was perfect. I also seasoned it with a dash each of: sea salt black pepper nutmeg mustard powder paprika and cayenne pepper. It was really awesome. Oh yeah I didn't use a crust because I'm doing low-carb.",

The parmesan made it grainy. Use either fresh or shredded parmesan that will melt. NOt the cheap kind in the canister (the only kind I had). That may help the texture out. I just found it bland with a heavy dose of onion... May work with some adjustments but I don't think it is worth the effort.",
