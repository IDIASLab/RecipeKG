I had ground beef and so that is what I used and then I couldn't imagine veggie soup without potatoes so I diced up a couple and added them. An hour into cooking  I gave it a stir and just felt there was way too much broth compared to the amount of veggies. All I had in the pantry was a can of pinto beans so I drained them and threw them in there. This recipe is good but I honestly think it needs more veggies than it calls for. I suggest using at least 2 cans of green beans or maybe even adding a can of mixed veggies to the mix. 2 hours was also plenty of cook time for me.",
