To turn this into a one dish meal, I added a can of diced tomatoes, some smoked, ground turkey sausage, 1 c rice, 2 c chicken broth, onion, garlic & caraway seeds. It would have made a great side dish, as is & made a great one dish meal with just a few additions. My changes made it taste a little like a deconstructed cabbage roll casserole. We enjoyed it.",
