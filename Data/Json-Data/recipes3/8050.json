(try her Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette Dressing) We're grilling steaks tonight and there's nothing that pairs better with a good grilled steak than a baked potato and a fresh garden salad. Well I needed a little something to spruce up that salad and this was it! This was perfect with a nice balsamic vinaigrette. I can't wait to expermiment with toasting the sesame seeds subbing parmesan cheese or smoked paprika. I can definitely see this in a pasta salad as a baked potato topper or even added to grilled or steamed veggies! Thanks for another great recipe!",
