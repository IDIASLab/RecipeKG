If you use Tony's or such, it will be salty.Would also like to say when I say simmer, I mean so slow the bubbles don't actually pop the top. A nice long slow simmer will make the beans creamy. If you use pickled pork in your beans, do not use the vinegar. And yes!!!! Tomato sauce!!! My Father-in-law, who is (very) Cajun, said \"Girl, these beans are good, don't change a thing. They taste like they do down in New Orleans....them some good beans.\"",

That being said, this recipe is amazing! I follow the direction minus the onion (the wife doesn't care for em) and holy cow it all turned out great! made it about 2 weeks ago now and the left overs lasted about 12 hours. I am making it again today as my family is flying in tonight so needed some nice warm good stuff to eat when we get home from the airport so came right back to this! Thank you for sharing and teaching an old dog new tricks!",
