I could have added more of the chipotle spice than I did. I just wanted to make sure I did not go overboard. This is a great recipe and I am from Texas and we love our spicy dishes. I now live out of state and long for spicy food that reminds me of home. This is a great recipe and all of the flavors marry well together. I will try this recipe again and I may even add a little more heat next time. J. Allen",

Some of the other reviews said it was too spicy or too salty but I think it is possible too much of the rub was used. You will make more seasoning rub than needed so just lightly coat the fish and either save or toss the rest. We also used a poblano pepper instead of jalapeno because that is what we had in the house so that may have reduced the spice a little. It was spicy but if you like a little spicy you will enjoy. We also used only 1 can of black beans and I didn't put the rice on my tacos although my husband did and we both loved how we made them. We also used smaller corn tortillas and each had 3 tacos with about 1/2 of the fish leftover for another night. Based on another review we used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream which was delicious. I used light versions of both to keep the calories down. The combination of all the flavors blended so well. Fantastic fantastic fantastic.",
