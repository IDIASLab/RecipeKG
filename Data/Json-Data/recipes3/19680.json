Cooking them was a bit tricky. I had the shrimp in a throw away foil pan on the grill with loads of butter and garlic powder. I let the shrimp cook a bit in the pan then put them on the grill for a few minutes. I had to be careful that the shrimp was cooked through under the bacon, but didn't want them to over cook.

If you cook the bacon until done the shrimp are WAY over cooked. I sprinkled my favorite seasonings over the shrimp before I wrapped and grilled them then served them with melted butter. I gave this only 3 stars because the recipe as written as I stated over cooks the shrimp. I used jumbo shrimp and they were large enough for a whole strip of partially cooked bacon. When the shrimp were done the bacon was grilled to perfection.",

To prevent burning the bacon or drying out the shrimps I placed them as far below the broiler as the oven would allow. This allowed the bacon to cook thoroughly...I turned them a couple of times too. Wonderful! I can't wait to make them again.",

In hindsight yes I think if the bacon was precooked a bit it might be nice (I hate rubbery bacon ew) But I did cook it according to the directions and if you use a thin-sliced bacon on a hot grill it did turn out wonderful and they were all gobbled up at my barbeque. ALSO- I did not use full slices of bacon I cut them in half! But make sure they fit around the size of shrimp you use before cutting them all you don't want to cut them too short and waste with the bacon not fitting! Very popular and I will definitely make again! I also tossed the shrimp with some terriaki sauce and marinaded 1/2 hour beforehand.",
