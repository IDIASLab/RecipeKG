Substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise, added a little extra sharp cheddar cheese and sauteed the sweet onions in about a teaspoon of bacon drippings before adding to the chicken/spinach mixture.  I used the advised amount of salt and pepper but substituted approx 1/4 tsp each of McCormick's Roasted Garlic & Herb Seasoning and 1/4 tsp of their Vegetable Seasoning Blend.  It filled up a deep dish pie crust to the brim and took 55 minutes to cook instead of 35 to 40 but it was delicious.  The flavor was perfect, not too salty.  My husband said he doesn't like spinach but he loved this quiche.",
