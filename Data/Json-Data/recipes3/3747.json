First of all I don't think the author of this recipe could have possibly meant 1 sheet of puff pastry. I use Pepperidge Farm puff pastry and one sheet of that will NOT roll out that much. Maybe pie crust or phyllo? My pate-mushroom mixture just went all wet so I don't think rolling it up like a wellington would have been so successful anyway. I wound up putting the fish in a 11x7 pan topping it with the pate-mushroom mix and the puff pastry on top of that. It tasted great and even reheated well but it was a fussy recipe for what you wind up with IMHO. I probably won't make it again for that reason.",
