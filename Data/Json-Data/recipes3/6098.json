That being said I made the following changes: white basmati rice family pack of chicken legs with thigh (4lbs.) canned diced tomatoes frozen okra 2 cups frozen corn/peas/carrots/beans mix and creole-type seasoning. Everything else remained the same. There was so much liquid I baked this uncovered the whole time. The rice also came out mushy and shapeless. Chicken wasn't flavourful and the skin rubber-y. This recipe has potential if the cooking method is changed; cook the rice separately using 4 cups of stock (we use a rice cooker). Combine the remaining cup of stock and only one can of tomatoes in a baking dish. Add veggies (I'd use the same combination as this time) bay leaves and mix it all up. Rub the chicken with Creole-type (anything cumin-y is great) seasoning and brown on the stove in a pan (reduces oven time gets the skin a little crisp and adds flavour). Add on top of veggie-stock mixture and bake uncovered for 30-45 minutes or until done. Serve on top of rice.",

(brown) rice 15 oz stew tom. 1 c. okra 2 c. ckn broth. I used instant rice as I usu. have poor results w/rice cooking throughly when baking. I added a light salting of Konriko creole seasoning for flavor but not too much in case the kids found it too spicy. Next time think I'd add more. I omited the s&p. I added canned corn. Baked for about 1 hr. covered then 5 min uncovered & ckn fell right off bone. This would be great easy meal for a cold winters day. As it turns out our local famers mkt has okra now (mid-summer) so we indulged even though it's really better winter food. As a challenged cook I appreciated this idea for okra.",
