I think next time I prepare this - I will add either shallots mushrooms and/or fresh parsley that has been sauteed in butter - after the sauce is thickened - and then serve it on angel hair pasta or \"bird nest\" pasta. Perhaps the reviewer before me didn't like it because they didn't use their favorite wine? I used a medium sweet white wine this time - but will use a drier one next time.",
