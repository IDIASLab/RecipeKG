Also, I used 1 1/2 eggs and a splash of white wine to give the rivels more body. It's even fun to cook -- took all of 15 minutes.",

                "reviewBody": "As written this recipe is not so great. With a few MINOR tweaks and clarifications it's easily a 4-5 star simple soup. The first change is in the directions; you need to start the broth boiling FIRST (and I'd recommend first sauteing as aromatic in your stock pot w/some EVOO or butter onions and carrots first THEN adding the broth). Per prior reviews AND because I like a brothy soup I doubled the chicken broth and can't imagine what this would be like it if I hadn't; there wouldn't be enough liquid to support the rivels and corn. I also chose to add some previously grilled and frozen shredded breasts since I had it handy and available. While the broth is coming to a boil mix the rivel mixture. Per other reviews I doubled the egg and that seemed to be just right. Be aware when you add the dough to make sure there are no clumps because they will remain clumps (as I learned the hard way). THANKS Sue for a great chilly afternoon lunch!",
