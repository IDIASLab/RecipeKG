I was a bit wary of the \"Italian\" nature of the seasonings used on a delicate fish like walleye. The seasonings were not actually too strong but they were just wrong with the natural flavor of walleye. Just made the fish taste un-wonderful and walleye is expensive. I would have done better just to pan-fry with a light flour coating with salt pepper and lemon which would have complemented the fish. Sorry a complete fail for me.",
