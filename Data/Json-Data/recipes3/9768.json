I used 3 types of vinegar (which came to more than 2 tablespoons total: white balsamic, red wine and rice vinegars. I tossed in a generous handful of baby spinach leaves chopped up, cucumber slices halved and about a dozen mini mozzaball cheeses cut in half. I added some halved black olives and leftover coked string beans too. Also for my own taste I included a 2nd jar of marinated artichoke hearts along with the marinade, didn't use the plain kind in water (the recipe doesn't say which type to use).",
