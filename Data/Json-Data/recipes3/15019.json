Chicken releases a lot of juices in the first  few minutes of cooking leaving your sauce in a puddle underneath the chicken. My recommendation is to wait until that first flip and then baste your sauce mixture on with every flip. That way by the time you get to the broil step you have a nice even coat of sauce on your wings which browns up nicely under that broiler. I also recommend reducing total cook time to 45 minutes.",
