The beans add the texture of the meat, which I appreciate in place of the ground beef substitutes for vegetarians - those products add a lot of salt and I suspect would over-salt the recipe.  Used a mish-mash of dried italian seasonings in place of fresh and it wasn't an issue.  Drying the cottage cheese and spinach is key here.",
