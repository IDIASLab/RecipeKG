We used shrimp instead of chicken (cook separately and add shrimp at the end or they will be over done) vegetable stock instead of chicken stock and extra zucchini in place of the mushrooms. We also did what other commenters said and used balsamic vinegar instead of Italian. We served it over couscous. I'll definitely be making this again!! It had great flavors I cleaned my plate.
