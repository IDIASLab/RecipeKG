With these two modifications the dip was exactly what I am used to for New England Bean Dip. For a while I had been reticent to try a mayonnaise-based recipe because the dip doesn't have a mayo flavor at all but I am glad I finally gave it a try. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

I cut the relish in half and it was still too much the mayo made it too rich and it was bland. I added some sour cream to reduce the richness and also added some chili powder and tabasco sauce to give it some more flavour. Also the recipe did not say to make in the processor so initially the beans were whole but obviously that doesn't make much of a dip. After all my changes it is edible but I still wouldn't make it again. Sorry!",
