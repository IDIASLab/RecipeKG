It really over powers the flavors of the salad. Not what I expected from a vinaigrette. But with that being said I am going to give it a higher rating because it is awesome on grilled chicken and pasta. I didn't want to throw it away so I mixed it in with some left over pasta, grilled chicken, and parmeasean cheese. It tasted almost like pesto but lower in calories and fat. So give it a try on your pasta and skip in it as a salad dressing.",

So I chopped up everything real fine then put Hubs to work with a mortar and pestle which did the trick nicely. As I slowly drizzled in the olive oil it came together into a nice rich emulsion. This was really good - both the fresh basil and garlic are evident but neither overpowers. It is thicker than the typical vinaigrette as some reviewers commented but I had no problem lightly dressing the salad with it.",
