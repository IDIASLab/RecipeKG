I tripled the amount of oil which helped because I didn't have to continually turn the chicken thus causing the coating to fall off. I don't think I will make this recipe again.",

Try a cheese-and-onion flavour. AND: don't fry. Pack in an oven dish and bake drizzled with a little olive oil. This way the covering won't come off either.",
