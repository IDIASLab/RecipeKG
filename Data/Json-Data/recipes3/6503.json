I had medium shells instead of penne so I used them.  The portobellos I sliced into medium thick strips and I had a jar of roasted red bell peppers that I used instead of fresh.  Everyone loved this dish!  One thing to note, I have yet to find alfredo sauce that isn't salty so don't add any salt until you've tasted it just before it's ready to plate.  Mine didn't need any because the salt in the alfredo sauce was enough.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks to the original poster.",

Instead of shrimp I cooked chicken seperately in salt and pepper and then cut into strips and served over the pasta. I used parmesan cheese instead of Romano, and added chopped spinach instead of mushrooms as I don't like mushrooms. It was absolutely delicious! My husband never goes back for seconds, but with this he went back for thirds!",
