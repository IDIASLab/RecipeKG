You can even use boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I usually make a package of red or black beans with rice to serve with it while the fish cooks. If you have any leftovers, they make great fish tacos.",

I usually take the whole can peppers & sauce & grind it in the mini chopper. Then I drop tablespoons of it onto a cookie sheet lined with non-stick foil. Pop in the freezer until they are set & you can pop off the tray into a ziploc & store in the freezer & use as needed. I usually use 2 tablespoons for each chipotle a recipe calls for. You can also stir into into Chili or soups or enchilada sauce for some extra kick. Also be sure to salt the avocado sauce well if you think it is bland adjust the salt. If it is not salted it is just green goo. If you want it spicier add some of the ground chipotle.",

But just have to tell you a funny stroy - the first time I made it I read the directions wrong and used the whole can of peppers - no wonder it was so hot.  But now I did as some one else recommended and freeze them in two tablespoon increments and then when I make it the peppers are ready.  ORIGINAL RATING:  I saw this recipe and really liked ihow it looked;  and then went home last night and made it and am in love.  The sauce its GREAT and is not suppose to be like guacamole its a wonderful dressing that really goes nice with the 'hot' spices; a great complement to the dish.  The only thing I did different was to add cilantro to the dressing and its great.  I have told several people about it already this morning.  I WILL make it again.  Thanks a lot.  PS - I also cooked up the rice from Chipotle's to go with it.  Great dinner, if you like spicy you will love it.  Just sorry I forgot to make Margarita's it was late when I got home and totally forgot.  Its quick and easy to make after a long day at work.  : - }",

I doubled the whole recipe which made LOTS of sauce but its okay it doubles as a sort of dip:) I couldn't find the pepper and adobo sauce so I followed other's suggestions and substituted Chipotle hot/tabasco sauce. It smelled so good! And I used \"Hint of Lime\" Tostitos for the breading for some extra flavor. The only thing i'd say is make a little extra of the salsa blend to drizzle lightly over the fish before the avocado just for a little extra punch.",
