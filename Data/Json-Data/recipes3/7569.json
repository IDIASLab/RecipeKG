Also I used only about half of the dressing and mixed it in with the salad instead of drizzling it - turned out great. I made the following changes and was happy with them: used only 1/4 cup olive oil; mixed half blue cheese with half goat cheese to cut down on the strong blue cheese flavor. I think it was an attractive appetizer when arranged in a pretty way on a plate.",
