Or beef measurement?\" Checked and re-read and yup it says \"1 1/2 cups ground beef\" and I could only assume that meant pounds but I ended up using 1 lb. anyways along w/ the rest of the ingredients decreased to 6 servings. Not sure what the surprise was; surprise! It's a little too salty or surprise! There's a little kick from the cayenne pepper or surprise! I've never brushed olive oil on top of a meatloaf b4. But well we were surprised at how good it ended up tasting but not thrilled that even after letting it sit it didn't slice into nice pieces pfffflooof more of a crumble-loaf but a tasty one.",
