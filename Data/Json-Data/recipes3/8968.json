It was very moist and flavorful and that came mostly from the beer--even though I used Coors Light a very lightweight beer! I had a difficult time getting the ranch dressing to stick to it so my glaze didn't turn out quite like the author intended. I will look forward to trying it again after I read some helpful hints by other reviewers. Thanks for a great foray into beer butt chicken!",
