This is my second time making it and decided to use Sherry Cooking Wine, definitely tasted a lot better than White Wine. I would recommend a bottom and a top crust, but cook the bottom crust for about 5 minutes that way your bottom crust will be more crispy. Also, add a 15 oz can of diced potatoes and cut the frozen vegetables to 1 cup of carrots or corn and 1 cup of peas (if you like them) and I mixed everything in one pot this time and still turned out GREAT!!!  Too many dishes last time. Thanks for a great recipe.",

I doubled the veggies at the begining adding 4 carrots, onion, celery and 3 cloves minced garlic. I also sauted 4 cups of mushrooms until the liquid had evaporated and set them aside to add with the peas. I also added red pepper flakes for some heat to the sauce. Lastly to lighten it up, I used fat free evaporate milk and low sodium broth. I made this in a casserole dish and used Bisquick for the crust. Followed the recipe on the box,  2cups bisquick, 1 cup milk and 1 egg.  After 10 min in the oven I brushed it with egg white wash.\nIt turned out beautiful and brown. I let is rest for almost an hour. It was perfect to cut into, maintained its shape. What awesome comfort food!",

I was never a fan of peas and carrots but I used baby sweet peas (which were great!) and instead of carrots I used corn and whole button mushrooms. I also added a little nutmeg and I used 2 crusts for each pie (1 for top & 1 for bottom) instead of only 1 crust. The cream sauce tastes wonderful and when the pie is cut the sauce does not run out like with frozen pot pies so it cuts very nicely. I also boiled boneless chicken breasts instead of using rotisserie chicken and it came out great! Enjoy! It really tastes great!!! I will make it again & again!!!",

Knowing this, I used half Chardonnay in place of half the Sherry. I also sprinkled in about 2 tsp fresh lemon juice and laced gently with a tsp of white wine Worcestershire sauce, which lends a lovely depth to the flavor, but is by no means required. Also stirred in one tsp Dijon mustard and some snipped rosemary from the garden. Just lovely. Comfort food, times 10! BTW, if you want to prep it completely the night before, you can do so by simply brushing a thin coating of butter on the bottom crust (to seal the pastry against becoming soggy from the moisture in the filling,) pouring the filling in the sealed crust, topping with the second crust, fluting, covering and refrigerating. Just preheat the oven and bake when you come home from work for a complete, easy, homey dinner. Edited to add: Since this is now a beloved family favorite, I invested in a super dry Sherry from Jerez, Spain, the home of genuine Sherry.  Expensive, but so worth it! I have dropped the half white wine, using only this  Sherry. Outstanding! I wouldn't have thought it was possible to improve, but this increased the wow factor exponentially.",
