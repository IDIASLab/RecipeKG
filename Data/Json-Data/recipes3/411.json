I would suggest using 16 Twinkies and keeping them whole- do not cut them in half.  Further, I would reduce the frozen whipped topping from a 12 oz. to an 8 oz. container.  Then I think it would reach perfection! Simple to make, yet impressive!Great spring/summer dessert!",

I did have to use 12 Twinkies though. The biggest change I made was to use Supreme Strawberry Topping from this site in place of ready made strawberry glaze. I took one look at the ingredients in that stuff and just could not bring myself to buy it. Besides Supreme Strawberry Topping is to die for and very easy to make. I also added a few blueberries for that red white and blue look. The end result was great to look at and even better to eat. Just make sure you give it enough time to set in the fridge before serving.",
