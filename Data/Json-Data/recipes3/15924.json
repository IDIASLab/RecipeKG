I tend to go with savory things most of the time but my husband has a sweet tooth. I'm a fan of both chocolate and peanut butter but not together. I know... odd however it happens to be the Hubs favorite. I will make these for him again! I forgot to mention I didn't have the nuts called for so I used chopped roasted peanuts instead. I don't think it made a huge diference.",
