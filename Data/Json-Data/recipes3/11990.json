                "reviewBody": "The sauce was very runny. And you'd better love Gorgonzola cheese. In all fairness I had 2 extra ounces of Gorgonzola cheese that I needed to use before it went off so I just added it to the sauce. But I think even 8 oz. instead of 10 oz. would have been too much. We liked the radicchio but 2 cups wasn't enough for the sauce. Luckily I went ahead and wilted a whole head thinking I'd use the remainder in another recipe instead I added it to this one & still wished that I would have had more to add. It really helps to cut/compliment the flavor of the Gorgonzola. It didn't take 5 minutes to wilt the radicchio on medium heat on my stovetop. I didn't add any extra salt as the cheese provided plenty. We didn't even notice the taste of the nutmeg so you might want to taste this & add more as you go along. I'll try this recipe again using 4 oz. Gorgonzola & 4 oz. of something else. I think I'll also use either rotini or campanelle pasta in place of the gnocchi.",

I replaced the gnocchi for rigatoni, it was FANTASTIC! Also, thought about sprinkling a few walnuts, but decided to keep it as is. I am glad I was right with my intuition as someone also suggested to add walnuts. I did however add more radicchio. It is like spinach: shrinks a lot! I  will make this recipe again and will add a few walnuts. Since this was my first time making it, I decided to make only two servings to test it and served as a side to roasted chicken thighs. I must concurr with Ms. Buckwheat Queen: the recipe yields very generous portions even with actual shaped pasta!  One serving split between the two of us as a side was enough. This recipe is restaurant quality and above all is EXTREMELY EASY AND FAST!",
