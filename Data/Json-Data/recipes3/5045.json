(I've used brown rice and jasmine rice -- both are good.) If you're substituting rice, I recommend cooking it first since it takes a while. Then, heat your broth, add the rice, and then add the lemon/egg mixture. Other substitutions: I've used veggie broth and \"no chicken\" broth to make this a vegetarian recipe. I also really like lemon, so I add the juice of 2 lemons instead of one. This is a relatively uncommon soup, but if you like lemon, I highly recommend trying it out!",

I looked up this recipe and was very pleased with the results minus the foamy texture. I substituted lemon juice for the fresh lemon and it was still great. I took it off of the stove about 2 minutes after the egg/lemon mixture was added. Rather than serving it immediately as the directions state I let it sit for about 10 minutes and stirred it a couple of times. That decreased the foamy texture so that the rich flavor came through without all of the \"fluff\". I also added soy chicken strips which I cooked first then added into the soup. My husband LOVED it and is taking the leftovers to work for lunch. I will definitely make this again even if I'm not in a rush!!!",

I then added a few Tbs of butter another lemon cooked shredded chicken and fresh spinach that I just tore apart and cooked into the soup. If you don't like the froth then just let the soup sit on low for a while and a lot of the froth will go away I liked it both ways. This soup can be as simple or as complicated as you wish.
