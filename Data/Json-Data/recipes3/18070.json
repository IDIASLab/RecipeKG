Then I sprayed them with cooking spray, and baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes (when the edges started to brown). They held their shape and didn't crack. We enjoyed eating \"the bowls\" as much as the ice cream! I topped them with caramel sauce, whipped cream and a cherry. I will make this very often!",

This recipe was so EASY and exactly as I remember real fried ice cream. I have been searching for this recipe and I am SO glad it was submitted! I do have one suggestion, though: buy the box of corn flake crumbs (it's next to bread crumbs in the grocery store). The crumbs are so much finer than you could make at home, and it makes a much better coating. I did dip the ice cream twice - you must have a really good coating for it to fry right. I will make this again and again and again......THANK YOU!!!",

Although this recipe is very similar to what you would get at a Mexican restaurant, I've found a way to make this dessert without frying it and with much more flavor. In a medium heat skillet, I combine 1/4 cup butter, 1/3 cup flaked sweetened coconut, 1/3 cup chopped pecans, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1/2 cup flour. I stir everything until crumbly and golden brown. Then, I let it all cool down. I make the ice cream balls and roll them in the crumbly mixture and put them in the freezer covered until ready to serve. Then, I drizzle them with honey. I think this way is easier and has a lot more flavor.",

Also, the reason why it fell apart for some people was because you didn't freeze the ice cream long enough.  The best way to make fried ice cream is to prepare it the day before you plan on frying it.  This way your cereal coated ice cream balls are nice and frozen.  Also do the egg dip/cereal dip thing twice.  Here is how it should be done: 1.  Freeze the plain ice cream balls for 1-2 hours. 2.  Dip in non-whipped beaten egg and roll in the cereal/cinnamon mixture.  The freeze for 1-2 hours. 3.  Dip in the beaten egg again and roll in the cereal/cinnamon mixture again and freeze for several hours (overnight is good) 4.  Deep fry the cereal coated ice cream balls for 5 - 10 seconds.   5.  Drizzle with honey and chocolate syrup.  Top with whipped cream and a cherry.",
