Instead of using nutmeg I used a combination of garlic powder and oregano. I added a lot more oregano than garlic powder but that was the effect I was going for. 2. Also I did not measure out the amount of breadcrumbs instead I just used two pieces of bread-worth 3. I didn't have any onions on hand so I used one shallot instead. I also could not find my grater so I used a blender. All in all this recipe was quite delicious and I look forward to making it again sometime soon.",
