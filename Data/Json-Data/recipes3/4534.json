The best advice in the recipe was to broil the bread both sides and then take out and top with tuna, cheese, tomatoes, etc. In the past we've always had problems with the bottom of the bread being too soft. So thank you for that hint! Also, I love the idea of layering cheese, tomatoes, cheese. It tasted so good (even though the tomato made it a bit juicy to eat - it was worth it) Now, the only addition I have to your recipe is to put a little bit of fresh chopped garlic in--it enhances the flavor to perfection!",

I've lived in Jersey all my life and being that our state has more diners than any other in the nation, I've eaten in many, anywhere from Bergen County down to Cape May County. I order these great open faced sandwiches all the time. The thought of adding vinegar to the tuna never occured to me and I must say that it was a great addition. I skipped the salt (tuna alone has tons) added red onion and much more mayo. I'm not crazy about melted swiss, so I used my favorite Vermont cheddar. I'm a tuna nutcase, so this was the PERFECT lunch for me today! So good Linda and thanks!!",
