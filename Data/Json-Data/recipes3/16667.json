Both my Dad and I really liked the taste of these. I took a star away for two reasons though. One was due to the stringiness of the spinach. Next time I will definitely chop the spinach up very fine. The other thing was the presentation. I just didn't think they were overly \"pretty\". That's IMHO of course so see my photo and judge that for yourself. Definitely enjoyed them though and glad I made them. Thanks Valali!",
