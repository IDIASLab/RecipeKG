Nothing spectacular but if you are going for fast frugal and easy easy easy-- this is your dip. Perfect for what I wanted: football food for the game. I followed the recipe exactly but next time i will try to fill the need for something zippy by adding some chipoltle jalepeno or other spicy pepper-- or maybe some cayanne. It was rich and filling but a little boring and \"premade\" tasting because of the lack of seasoning or fresh ingredients. Thumbs up for ease of prep though.",
