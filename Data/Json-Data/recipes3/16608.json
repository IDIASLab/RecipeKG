His reason was now that he has been eating goat cheese rather than feta on his salads everyday he has developed a preference for goat cheese and didn't care for the feta. I prefer feta and think most people do so I won't deduct a star for that! I absolutely LOVED this so I overruled and gave it 5 stars. Also I normally don't eat lamb because I didn't think I liked it but I DID use it in this and it was awesome! Don't automatically substitute beef if you're not familiar with lamb! Try it in this recipe the flavors go great together!",

Also instead of two chopped tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes and I think it could still use some more sauce. I added some dried mint and a dash of cinnamon for more Greek flair. This does make a ridiculous amount of filling unless your peppers are gigantic you can fill a 1 1/2 quart casserole easily to cook alongside.

I used.5 pounds lamb with 1 pound ground beef (will either use all beef next time or still maintain the same ratio as I don't love lamb) and half an onion based on personal preference. To circumvent what everyone was saying about the undercooked pepper I blanched them for 2 minutes each in boiling water then threw them into ice water immediately. After filling and baking there was still some crunch left to the peppers but they were cooked perfectly. Otherwise followed the recipe to the T and thought these were amazing. Also this recipe makes a perfect amount of stuffing. Most recipes that require stuffing - you're always worried that there isn't enough stuffing but this made enough to fill 6 green peppers (I always get them from Whole Foods - they have the most gorgeous giant green peppers) and leave some loose for extra nibbling and round out that meal for the hubby. Most of the time I have to bump up a 6 serving meal to make 6 true servings for us but this one is dead on.",
