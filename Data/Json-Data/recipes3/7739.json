I have a very low tolerance to spice but this small amount was fine I just borrowed it from my roommate. Even with the hot pepper it had no fire at all.",

But it was so thick after everything was in there wasn't anything to simmer. I had to add over a cup of water to get it right. Also it was very bland. I had to add the rest of the can of tomato soup cumin a little brown sugar and more PP spice. I used hot chili sauce in place of hot pepper sauce. After my changes it was actually pretty decent but the recipe is not good. Sorry.",
