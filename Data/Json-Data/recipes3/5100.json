I used only carrots. 6 cups of bread crumbs is at least twice the amount needed. I had to add extra eggs/oil just to be able to form them into patties. They didn't even stick to the bran flakes and they ended up tasting like bread crumb cakes with a bit of carrots. The next batch I made with a mixture of carrots/zucchini. I doubled the amount of veggies and halved the amount of bread crumbs. This time they turned out great. I ate them on their own and dipped them in garlic mayo. 1 star for the recipe 4 star for the taste with major modifications.",

For those who are going to try I minced the onion & microwaved it with the carrots. It cooked nicely - no crunches. I didn't do the cereal coating & cooked 'em in a pan. 'Glad I tried it but won't make it again. Next day: Had one cold. 'Reminded me of Thanksgiving bread dressing. Not a bad idea. Making dressing patties (with my recipe). Camping. Kids. Hmmm. I think the bread crumbs in it plus serving it on bread is just too much - yeah bread. Maybe it's a better side dish with some type of gravy or sauce?",
