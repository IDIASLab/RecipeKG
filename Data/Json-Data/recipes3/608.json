To my disappointment I kind of agreed with the negative reviews more than the positive ones. The smell of the dish is very difficult to handle, I just kept thinking it's going to taste wonderful, so we'll get past this smell,  but it didn't happen.  It left a bad after taste in our mouths and actually, not a very pleasant first taste. My husband said it was alright, but he wouldn't recommend us trying it again. Maybe I did something wrong in making it, I was pretty sad that it didn't work out, I was excited about trying a new recipe.  Oh well, maybe next recipe will be better.",
