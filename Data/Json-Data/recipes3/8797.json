I love kalamata olives and cook with them frequently they were an off flavor in this dish for me.  The spices were over powering, it would have been nice to taste the vegetables.  This could be a great recipe if these changes were made.  I knew going into this it was way too much oregano, thyme, and basil but I am a believer making a recipe as written first.",
