It didn't heat thoroughly (SO did it on her own) but that's more an issue of SO being less-than-culinary-inclined than the recipe. Only issue with recipe overall potatoes came out kinda bland. Meat was great (a little greasy for me but SO loved it) trying to separate the carrots/potatoes were a pain and yeah potato was a little bland.
