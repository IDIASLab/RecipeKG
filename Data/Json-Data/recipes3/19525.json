I halved the recipe for the two of us and substituted Italian parsley for the cilantro. I also added some chunky portabella mushrooms and minced fresh garlic. I wasn't sure how the Balsamic vinegar would fly in this recipe and was tempted not to use it. But in fairness to Lenie's recipe I did use it and it was amazingly delicious! Eating this we felt we really were doing something healthy and good for our bodies--very little fat few calories nutritious vegetables and the right type of carbs. We enjoyed this and ate every last bit of it! Definitely worth making again or trying for the first time.",
