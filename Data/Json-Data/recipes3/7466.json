I did double the jalapeno and I ended up needing more salt, so added my favorite seasoning blend(garlic/onion/salt/black pepper), but it sure is easy and great to have for folks to have a place to start. It would also be great with a bit of chipotles added! Thanks Mis7up! :)",

If you want green salsa, substitute canned tomatoes with tomatillos. If you want more heat, leave the seed and veins of both Jalapenos or add your favorite hot pepper. If you want less heat use one seeded and deveined Jalapeno. Do you want a smoky/roasted flavor, coat the tomatoes, onions, garlic cloves, and Jalapeno with oil and roast in the oven or stove top or grill, then peel the charred skins and use as directed in the recipe. Do you feel italian? Substitute the cumin for basil, and substitute the Jalapenos for 1/2 tsp Crushed Red Pepper, process so its very chunky; add olive oil, blk pepper, and balsamic vinegar, and you have a Quick Bruschetta. This is a great base for many recipes.",
