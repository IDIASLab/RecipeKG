Based on the complaint that there was too much mayo rather than reduce that ingrediant I added apprx 6-8oz cooked macaroni noodles and increased the cornflakes to 1 1/2 cups (1 cup into the mix and 1/2 cup for the topping). I also added 1/2 cup diced celery 1 4oz jar diced pimentos for color and spinkled in some shredded cheddar cheese over all. All else was left the same. Not dry perfect amt of \"creamy\" and very tasty and filling. Thanks for the new casserole idea Mary!",

Their unique texture seemed to be a bit of a distraction and you keep thinking \"what was that I just bit into?\" You may just want to leave them out completely because in my opinion they don't add all that much to the overall taste. I put only a thin layer of corn flakes on top but I would have liked it to be even more crunchy. You might also consider cooking the vegetables before adding them to the mix (though I only cooked the mix for 45 minutes so another 15 might have softened them up a bit more). Overall quite tasty but obviously the more things you add to it the longer it takes to make.",

They were a bit too crunchy for me. I would have preferred celery for a bit of crunch. But then again my kids (6 and 4) hate seeing anything green in their food and so they liked it better this way. Also I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the chestnuts. I did but then added in some of the liquid so the mix wasn't so dry. I liked the cornflake crumbs in the mix. It gave it a nice texture. For the topping I did what I always do and mixed the crumbs with some melted margarine or butter. This way the topping bakes and isn't just dry on top. I left the lid on and just pulled it off near the end to brown the topping a bit but really I think I could have left it on for the entire cooking time. Overall I found the recipe wonderfully easy to make and would rate it a bit above good.",
