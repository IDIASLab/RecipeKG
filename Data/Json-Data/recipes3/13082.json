        "description": "This is an easy recipe for cauliflower cheese but it's pretty versatile. You can use the cheese sauce with any vegetables you have handy. I often put a layer of cooked kale or broccoli on the bottom, then arrange the cooked cauliflower florets on top. You can change the flavor of the sauce by adding different cheeses you might have in your fridge. It takes a bit of elbow work to make the sauce but it's worth it. This is delicious served with roast beef or lamb.",

When using corn starch instead of flour the conversion is half as much corn starch as the amount of flour that the recipe calls for. I realized after I was done that I didn't do this. Sauce was nice and thick because of this. Next time I will add a pinch of cayenne to give the sauce a little more zing.",

I was multi-tasking and goofed by adding the sharp cheddar to the rest of the sauce instead of putting it on top as written. It still tasted great but it did alter the look of the sauce. I had another cheese sauce going at the same time that went with a completely different recipe. It called for green onions and I liked it so much that I added them with this one too. This sauce would go really good with many different things. It would also work great on the side for dipping. Definitely a keeper!",
