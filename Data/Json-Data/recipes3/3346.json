My husband and I loved it!  It was the best broccoli casserole I had ever had.  I remembered it for Christmas, and this time, I used cream cheese.  Well, it was thick and creamy, but tasted bland.  I would recommend replacing the cream cheese with cheddar cheese.  If you decide not to, though, just made sure you have the salt on hand!  Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.  I will definitely use it again, just not with the cream cheese.",

If you want something with an Alfredo flavor, buy Alfredo sauce...hmmm...not a bad idea!  Anyway, we made this, and it was a huge hit.  \n\nNeeded some salt, pepper, and garlic because it is a plain cream cheese flavor, but it's something so different from the normal brocc & cheese, and we loved it!  \n\nWe used Town House crackers, and while the crust part of it was soggy, it still added wonderful flavor, and I used a bit more than the recipe called for, and really covered the top of it. Then I sprinkled a bit of Lawry's Seasoned salt and just a tiny bit of freshly grated parmesan cheese on the top.  \n\nAlso, because we like crispy broccoli, I boiled the broccoli for only a few minutes, and it was still a crisp tender, even after the baking.  \n\nWe'll make it again!",
