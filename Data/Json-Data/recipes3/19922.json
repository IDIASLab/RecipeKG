                "reviewBody": "Thank for all the information in this section. I Grilled a Tri Tip for the first time today and it looks awesome. I followed the \"indirect heat\" method whereby I put the charcoals on one side of the grill and put the roast on the other side (actually I had three tri tips). I also found an old pan and put it at the botton to use as a drip pan. I added about a cup of water to the pan to keep the drippings from drying out. I only cooked my roasts for 3.5 hours because I didn't want it to become too dried-out. As for the drippings not much dripped down into the pan. However after I let the roasts sit for about an hour a ton of juice came out. I put that into a small 1 quart pot added some soy sauce 1/4 cup red wine 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and some salt... and heated it up and let it boil for a few minutes to make the Au Ju sauce. After a little \"tinkering\" I got the perfect taste but the sauce was a little bit lumpy. Since I didn't have any cheesecloth I came up with a great idea to use a coffee filter to strain the Au Ju sauce. So I just put the filter into the filter cup like I was making a single cup of coffee and poured the sauce through. It took a while to get it all done but the coffee filter got rid of all those specks of meat and fat as well as the big chunks of garlic that was left over... and the end result was AWESOME. My Au Ju sauce was very clear with a reddish hue to it. It looked like it was made in a restaurant and the taste",

We paired this meat with the Tasty Green Beans recipe on here and the two flavors melted together so nicely. My 7 yr old was the first to comment on how the flavors complimented each other and he was right. Definitely a keeper! If you want to try one and don't have time to marinade it buy one from the store already marinated. Or if you don't want to grill put roast in the oven at 450 for about 10 minutes than lower to 350 and cover with aluminum foil. You can take off foil for the last 10 mins if you prefer.",
