Popped the pan back into the oven until the cheese melted, and it was done.

The ground beef really needed some seasoning, so I used \"Taco Seasoning I\" from this site. I also used a Mexican blend cheese. I didn't microwave this, instead I layered everything in a 9x13 foil pan and baked it in the oven. When everything was nice and melted I prettied it up a bit by adding some shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, black olives, chopped green onions, and a nice dollup of sour cream on top. Overall, not bad with a side of a couple sides of homemade salsa and guacamole - very filling.",

At any rate- the taco seasoning on the meat was awesome- I also used pickled jalapenos cheese black olives and warm low fat refried beans. I served with sour cream and salsa. My husband deemed them the best nachos he's ever had! Popping the chips into the oven for a couple of minutes before topping works wonders with soggy issues.",

To perk it up a bit I followed others' suggestions by adding taco seasoning to the meat & baking the chips at 350 for about 8 minutes. I prepared 6 separate plates. On top of the chips I thinly layered the beans (which were heated first) & meat. I topped that with nacho cheese salsa warmed in the microwave then mild tomato salsa chopped green onions sliced black olives some chopped tomato shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream. I served extras of the chips & toppings on the side along with hot sauce and sliced jalapeno peppers for the more adventurous. There were no leftovers!
