Double the recipe and pat (not roll) dough out thick. 3. Place close together in baking pan so as they bake, they will touch sides and bake upwards instead of flattening out. My husband said to keep this recipe in our files! Thanks a bunch! Oops, but I should mention that I made these with butter instead of shortening. :)",

These turned out light and fluffy and tasted great with country gravy or jam.  I didn't have the self-rising flour so I used regular flour and added about 1 tablespoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt.  These rose nicely and because of folding the dough over before cutting, they were easy to separate into halves for buttering after baking.  My oven runs a little warm, so I only needed to bake for about 15 minutes.  Yummy! Thanks, this recipe is a keeper!",
