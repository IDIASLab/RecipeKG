So eay to make, I also used canned potatos so could skip that step. I just threw everything together in one big pot and let it simmer for a while. The only thing I added was a little bit of garlic, and about a cup of sharp cheddar cheese right before I took it off the stove. My fiance loved it. I loved it. I will definately be making this one again, and often. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!",

I also sauted some celery with the onion in olive oil skipped the water bit. Then added a bit of chicken flavored boullion powder after the milk. All tolled it was ready in around 30 min tops from start to finish! It is so easy to change and enhance. I would try adding dill next time or mabey green chilies for a spicier version no cayene use a splash of tabasco. You are NOT going to mess up this one. This is a great spur of the moment adder to a meal or pot luck. Kathar",

I increased the celery to 3/4 cup for extra veggies and tossed in a tablespoon of butter and a little garlic salt just for flavor. I think I spent about 7 on the ingredients and spent about 10 minutes in the kitchen. My husband (who hates having soup for dinner especially vegetarian soup) liked it so much he's been eating the leftovers cold out of the fridge. I will definitely make this again.",
