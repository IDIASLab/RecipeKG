I needed to cook some bacon for the chicken and I saw some reviewrs say that they thought a bit of crumbled bacon would taste good with this side dish.  So, I used just a little bit of the bacon drippings to \"fry\" up the corn and onions.  The result was amazing.  It tasted wonderful and the hubby and I both really liked.  I know not a healthy dish...but who cares.  Tasted great.  Thanks for the post.",
