I used green onions for the shallots and canned tomatoes that were seasoned with basil garlic and oregano. I also thought basil would be a better choice so I used that instead of parsley. Since I had a stick of pepperoni in hindsight I should have diced the pepperoni instead of slicing it. While saut\u00e9ing the sliced pepperoni domed up and looked very unappealing. The sauce was tasty which helped this a little. I won t be making this again but for those of you who want to give it a try I d suggest cutting way back on the pepperoni so it will enhance the flavor of the sauce rather than overpower it.",

I didn't have heavy cream or evaporated milk for the sauce so I used regular milk and made a roux with some flour. I added pepper but not salt because of the type of pepperoni I used.
