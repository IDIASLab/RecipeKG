I dipped the patties in egg and coated them in panko breading. pan fried in a non stick rachel ray small frying pan lightly sprayed with olive oil. I felt inspired to then put them on a baking sheet cover them in marinara sauce sprinkle each one with mozzerella and broil until the cheese was browned.
