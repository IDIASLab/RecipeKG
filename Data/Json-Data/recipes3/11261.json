The recipe itself is ok, but there are others out there, this site or another, which are simpler and just as tasty. I had no idea what \"Cajun\" seasoning is, but it just sounded a bit firey for my tastes, so I subbed 4 TBLS. mild chilli Verde (green) sauce. The mushrooms are always going to be bland so I thought the Verde would help. I prefer not to salt any recipe, only using salt as a table addition. I shook in a loose handful of bacon bits, for texture and some smokey flavor.  I had a hard time deciding how much onion would be good,  maybe because it only says ONE onion, so that leaves it up to the cook at prep. Still, I thought for all the prep effort this would be outstanding, but even using a grocery store pie shell, this was too much work for what should be a relatively simple dish.  Quiche is basically a casserole, and IMO we make casseroles for ease of preparation and the basic assumption we don't have to buy a huge number of off-the-wall ingredients. I can upgrade the recipe as needed but I doubt I will use it again.",
