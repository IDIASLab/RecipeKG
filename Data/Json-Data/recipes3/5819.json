Both the sausage(chourico or linguica) and jarred peppers (Pimenta Moida) are available online if you don't have a Portuguese market in your town.  I prefer linguica for flavoring soups because is has just a little more fat.  If you are trying to limit the fat, stick with chourico.",

I put those two ingredients in a large stock pot over 3T heated Olive Oil for about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.   I cubed 5 large Idaho potatoes, de-skinned and washed, I let them sit to dry out for a minute while I prepared 8 cups of buillion beef broth in a 2 quart saucepan.   I added sliced Portuguese Gaspars Chourico sliced ab. 1 inch each, then chopped in quarters.  Mixed that over the onion/garlic mixture for about 10minutes. Then, to this onion/garlic/oil/chourico mixture I added 1 can Red Kidney Beans, 1 can no salt diced tomatoes, 1/2t koarse salt, 1/2t black pepper.   I then added the boiled over buillion mixture with 2 cups of chicken broth to onion/chourico mixture in the stock pot. I added 2 Bay leaves and brought this to a boil about 25minutes. I then added 2 T vinegar, 8ounces macaroni, the chopped potatoes and cooked additional 20 minutes and added more stock/ beef buillion boiled in water if needed.   I then added washed 3 bunches of Kale and 1/2 head of cabbage thats been ripped in large bite sized pieces  (do not use hard stalks) into the veggie/chourico mixture.   I let it simmer and it was ready in about 20 minutes.   This is absolutely delicious! My husband who hates veggies ate all of them, including the kale, cabbage and diced tomatoes!!  This is a winner and so easy to make.",

Instead of the chourica I used hot italian sausage. Also instead of adding the 2 pork chops I added beef boullion to the water in the soup to add some meaty flavor. I also added a can of condensed split pea soup with ham which added great texture flavor and nutritional value. Instead of the Pimenta Moida peppers I added plenty of cayenne pepper and also a spoonful of hot chili paste. I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes. I included all of the other ingredients (onion garlic beans potatoes kale cabbage) as written. This was a delicious healthy spicy satisfying meal. I served with a loaf of french bread.",
