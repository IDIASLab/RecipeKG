I browned the chops in a pan after coating them with a mixture of flour garlic powder and mustard powder. I put the browned chops in the crock pot then covered them with the sauce. Cook on low for 7-8 hours. VERY DELICIOUS! The beauty of doing it this way is you can cook alot of chops! Thanks for sharing.",

I followed the recipe to the letter although I'm usually one of those cooks that just \"wing it\" not using ketchup normally in anything I cook I decided to be exact:-) It just tasted like a cafeteria meal which was sort of disappointing after all those rave reviews....I would leave out the ketchup add a bit of sherry and some chicken stock to thin the sauce garlic pepper parsley some thinly sliced red/green pepper along with the onions and then I think you might have a winner:-)",

I can't remember which but it's a very old-school recipe with a red and white plaid cover on the book. Anywhoo this was a favorite of mine growing up and I searched for it because I was craving it and wanted to make it for my guy. I was so happy to see it here! I made the following tweaks: 1) Doubled the sauce portion of the recipe; 2) Used Healthy Request Reduced Fat/Sodium Cream of Chicken AND Cream of Mushroom to cut down on calories/fat/greasiness; 3) Used 6 tablespoons of Lea & Perrins THICK recipe Worcestershire sauce; 4) A few heavy-handed dashes of TAPATIO hot sauce -- yes I'm serious!; 5) A generous pour from a bottle of Merlot I was drinking when I mad this dinner; and 6) Seasoned the chops with salt pepper & garlic powder and let rest for 7 minutes before browning. IT WAS AWESOME!!!! Zingy tangy savory... tender and comforting just as I remembered this recipe to be. If you're debating on making this don't! Try it out.... the sauce is killer and is great over mashed potatoes. I served it with a side of asparagus I marinated in olive oil soy sauce garlic and sea salt/pepper. My boyfriend loved it and I can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow. BUEN PROVECHO! Enjoy.:)",
