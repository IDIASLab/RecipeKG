I sauteed the red pepper and cauliflower in olive oil until the cauliflower was tender. I sprinkled a small amount of chili powder and a small amount of onion powder on the vegetables and added the black beans. I continued sauteing everything for about 3 minutes. I pulsed the sauteed vegetables in a cuisinart until everything was coarsely chopped. I served this with diced tomatoes gouda and mozzarella cheeses and sour cream on warmed tortillas.

We left out the celery because my son dislikes celery -- otherwise this is a really interesting and subtle combination of flavors that works very well indeed for a side dish. We used it alongside Black Bean Lasagna also from this site and it was perfect. It works well to make the sauce in advance and microwave it back to warm while steaming the veggies. I used a half head of cauliflower and a bunch of asparagus. Good recipe!",
