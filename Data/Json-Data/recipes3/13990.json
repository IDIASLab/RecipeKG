Came out great and my husband requests this at least twice a month for his lunches. Send it with some tortillas.",

I used the mexican flavored Rotel that is seasoned with lime and cilantro and was glad I did. This recipe is super simple and filling but it needs more than just salt and pepper to get a taco flavor in my opinion.",
