                "reviewBody": "This was a nice change of pace for pork chops I did a few things differently. First I dip the pork chops in the oatmeal then in the cream mixture then back in the oatmeal. I know everyone thinks the first coat will come right off but trust me it doesn't and the coating comes out much nicer. I do beleive this is probably the reason why I used more like 3 cups of Oatmeal and hardly any of the cream mixture. Second I used fat free half and half in place of the heavy cream to cut down on the fat and calories the flavor of the sauce was very good a little sweet (but hey what did I expect the recipe is called SWEET maple pork chops) but I think because of the fat free half and half it had a hard time thickening I added a little cornstarch to fix that up. Third I bought 2 packages of pork chops for a total of 8 chops I could only fit 6 chops in the pan with the onion/garlic/basil/maple syrup mixture. The remaining 2 chops I put in the frypan after I took everything out and cooked covered on low for 10 minutes by themselves. Having tried the chops both ways I don't feel this affected the taste at all and I would cook the chops this way when I prepare it again as it left the coating crispy and in tact on the chop. I definetely had trouble with the coating staying on the original 6 chops. Lastly I in no way used a quart of oil to fry these in if I were to approximate I'd say I used about a cup or so. We did enjoy the recipe and I'll be making it again. THANKS!!",

Next time I am going to try putting the oatmeal in the blender first to make a powder out of it then dip the chops in it. Also I see no need to use a whole quart of oil next time I will use a small amount in the skillet I think that the oats will stick to the chops better that way. I don't see why all that cream is necessary seems like you would only need a cup to dip the chops in. But it does have a nice flavor and is worth trying again and hopefully I'll get better results",

                "reviewBody": "The only reason I rate this a 3 is because the flavor is absolutely delicious. However the actual recipe as far as quantity goes was way off from what I found. 3 cups of heavy cream for the coating is entirely too much. Turned out to be maybe 1 cup needed and 2 cups in the trash. In order to coat the pork chops a lot more than 1/2 cup of oats is needed as well. I don't see the need to double-coat them either as when you put the chops into the liquid after putting the oats on they just fall off into the liquid which wastes more oats. Most of the oats fell off while frying also and for pan frying you need nowhere near a quart of oil. Following the recipe exactly would mean throwing away at least 2 c. each of oats heavy cream and oil..which really spoils the recipe for me. The flavor of the sauce is incredibly good but in the future I will prepare the pork chops in a more practical and less wasteful way and then make the sauce seperately.",

We could easily eat this once a week but the high fat and calories would show eventually!:) UPDATE: To cut the calories I used Promise spread in place of butter half and half instead of the cream and used butter lite syrup.

The actual amount of oats needed was closer to a 1/2 cup per chop the amount of cream was closer to one cup for the breading and one cup at the end for the sauce. The amount of maple syrup could be reduced to a 1/2 cup to avoid making the dish overly sweet. Also depending on the size of your pan the amount of oil could be reduced to 2 cups for browning chops. I would say this was an intermediate level recipe.",

It turned out so great!! My extremely picky mate scarfed down his chop and helped himself to another. The dish smelled divine cooking it looked so great plated up too. (I served the chops on a bed of whole wheat angel hair with maple green beans.) I agree with the others I used a lot more oats then called for and I did not need near the amount of cream for the breading (I used 2 cups and still threw out a good 1/2 cup or more).

Used extra thin pork chops and doubled the portions except the maple syrup. Some reviewers did not like it too sweet and if I had doubled the syrup it would have overpowered the dish. Made it with panko (Japanese bread crumbs) which seemed to stay on pretty well. I also cut way back on the oil. I also used fat free half and half as another reviewer suggested.
