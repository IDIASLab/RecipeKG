I did not use the almonds but did add a very small amount of chopped walnuts. I also added just over 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate morsels which really went well here. Extracts can be strong and I found the almond extract flavor to be very noticeable but I liked that also since you don't usually get that with banana breads. Like another reviewer mine (used 3 mini loaf pans) was also ready at 30 min. Great recipe!",

Stuck to regular milk and skipped the almonds, since I was already using so many hazelnuts. Almond version is better, but this is still delicious!",
