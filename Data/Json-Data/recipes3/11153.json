Very pungent spices really zing up this dish.  I found myself sampling one slice, and then another, until I had \"sampled\" almost a full serving!  Beware though, I used only 4 large sweet potatoes, and they were more than a single layer in a sheet pan.  This recipe could definitely use a weight amount for the sweet potatoes, so use your judgment, or be ready to do two pans.",
