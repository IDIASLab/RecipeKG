The poblano pepper needs to be roasted then peeled- to give a richer flavor-and not put in the water with the pasta; then pureed.That should take care of the bitterness. Be careful with Poblano peppers because they can be quite hot at times. Do not be fooled when you get a mild one! Half of an onion is plenty. Chihuahua cheese instead of Mozzarella makes the dish more authentic.",

There is really no need to chop the pepper as it will be put in the blender anyway after boiling. I imagine peeling the whole boiled pepper before blending would cut down on the bitterness but I think this recipe could still benefit from something sweet mixed in. And if you're looking for something spicy you'll have to add another type of pepper to this recipe; Poblano is extremely mild. I might also suggest adding chopped pork or chicken otherwise (obviously) this recipe is just noodles and sauce.",
