I used a package of raw chicken tenders (about 10 to a package) instead of a whole chicken.  I boiled those with celery, onion, garlic, and a lot of different spices in a big pot of water.  To help with the budget \u2013 I used only 5 of the chicken tenders once cooked and used 2 cups of cooked rice.  I also added some of the strained veggies from my stock to add texture and color.  I used only half of the cheese sauce and topped with crushed buttery crackers.  Came out great \u2013 good comfort food \u2013 good food for a snowy day!  The economical part \u2013 I used the rest of the stock, veggies,  tenders, in addition to a small bag of frozen stew veggies, and a little \u201csoup\u201d pasta  to make a fabulous chicken soup!  I added a tiny bit more milk to the leftover cheese sauce (and spices) to add to a little bit of leftover pasta and veggies that were in the fridge to make a nice lunch!  I could have also made creamed peas with the rest of the cheese sauce too \u2013 but had to use the other leftovers first!  So \u2013 I highly recommend this recipe \u2013 it can be stretched and if you keep the stock and veggies \u2013 you can get two plus meals out of one!!!!!!!!  Thanks a million!!!!!!!!!!!",
