A extra 5 min. but it had a big payoff in taste made an exceptional difference. The red vinegar darkens this a little bit but is a nice variation.",

The first time I made it exactly as written and used Wishbone's fat-free italian and it came out pretty good but not flavorful enough. The second time I switched the green bell to red for color and added some mushrooms to the mix...mmmmm! I also doctored up a packet of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix with olive oil, a bit of crushed tomatoes and some garlic-red wine vinegar to make a flavorful tomato vinegarette--yum! Oh, and definitely go the full hour or more for flavor. I usually hate feta, but I gave it a try using a garlic-herb variety and it definitely enhanced the overall appeal. My husband liked it and I enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day (even more flavorful then!!).",

I loved it but my boyfriend didn't care for it only because he flat-out refuses to eat vegetables but I think with the right veggie combinations this will slowly win him over. Be sure to let it marinate for the full hour if not more. I only had time to let it sit for 45 minutes and a lot of the vegetables hadn't really soaked up the dressing. Otherwise great recipe and very easy.",
