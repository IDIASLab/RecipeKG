Added about a tablespoon or two of flour and cooked for 1-2 minutes. Then I added the cream. I added a couple ounces of grated asiago cheese, too. For the pesto, I reduced the parmesan since I had added some asiago to the cream. I salt and peppered the sauce after I had combined the pesto and the cream. Next time, I will add garlic to saute with the mushrooms because I like a more garlicky sauce. In a separate pan, I cooked cubes of chicken breast seasoned with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning in olive oil. When the chicken was just about cooked, I threw some prosciutto in there as well. I added the chicken and prosciutto to the cream sauce (using a slotted spoon so the sauce woulodn't get too oily) at the end to heat it through again.",

I did make made a few changes to the recipe. To the sauce I added extra garlic and used half parmesean and half romano cheese. I also used heavy whipping cream because that's what I had at home but will probably use 1/2 and 1/2 next time to make it a little healthier. I used farfalle pasta and added boiled chicken then poured the sauce over it all tossed it and enjoyed. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again!",

Wow. Even better it was. I recommend that you wait until the sauce is almost done before adding salt and pepper. You probably won't need much seasoning.

I also added another garlic clove a few dashes of onion salt pepper oregano and dash of sugar. I divided the recipe in half and still had plenty for 5 or 6 servings due to the fact that I kept adding milk and half and half in an attempt to thin it out a bit... still very thick. I served it with basil garlic shrimp over spinach pasta from this site. This is one of those meals that makes me wonder why I even bother going out to eat... it doesn't get better than this! Try it!
