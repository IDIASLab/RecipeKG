Anyone who knows their way around a kitchen, knows that once you add salt, it's a bit difficult to fix if it's too salty. Follow my advice - add half the salt, stir and taste and do it at the end of making the salsa. I added fresh mint to the salsa and the sweetness of this did help the taste.(But not enough, sorry. My kids who love mango rated this 2 1/2 *. I had two mangoes, lots of fish and doubled the recipe. I also dipped the fish in flour after rubbing with curry rub and this made a nice, curry, crunchy coating on the outside and the rub was worth 3 1/2*. Overall, I'd try the rub again, but the salsa was salt overkill. ",
