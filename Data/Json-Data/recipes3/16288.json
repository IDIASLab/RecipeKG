I was out of chili powder and used the author's suggestion of substituting the spices with taco seasoning (I used Taco Seasoning I from this site). I had a really large head of cauliflower, which yielded close to 48oz cauliflower rice, and quadrupled the amount of ingredients. My only problem was that there seemed to be way too much liquid and took a long time to reduce. Still wonderful flavor nonetheless and I just used a slotted spoon to serve the rice. However, my husband said he could eat it even with the excess liquid. Next time I'll try reducing the amount of tomato sauce and broth called for by half and update this review accordingly. This will definitely be a go to in our house as an alternative to Mexican Rice! Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

It took about 20 minutes or longer for all the liquid to absorb. I was afraid it would make the cauliflower mushy but it wasn't at all. We had it with fish tacos and it was good inside the tacos as well as a side dish. i will definitely make this again-super easy and delicious!",
