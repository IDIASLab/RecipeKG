My family likes adding the eggs after adding the rice for a more moist pilaf; otherwise, cook the eggs before adding the rice to attain a drier version. Serve warm.",

It came together pretty quickly. I used pre-cooked dried chickpeas instead of canned, due to personal preferences. I also made a couple of substitutions/omissions based on dietary preferences and what I had on hand - omitted the\u00a0green pepper and sundried tomatoes, and used sauteed tofu instead of eggs and veg broth instead of chicken broth. I could see adding this into my regular meal plan- it brings together many ingredients my family eats regularly anyway, and was a hit.",
