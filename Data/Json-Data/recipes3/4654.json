Will definitely make over and over again!",

The 24 eggs called for in the original recipe overflowed in my pan when I tried to stir it, making a mess in my oven.  I cut the recipe in half using a slightly smaller pan and it worked great.  If you are planning a brunch and want eggs of some kind these work well.  They did not seperate or become runny from sitting for a while if kept warm.",
