First I used about 7 cups of broth. 6 cups of chicken broth, 1 can of beef broth.  The beef broth DEFINITELY adds that extra punch this soup needs.  Definitely only use 1/2 cup of orzo, and boil in a seperate pot.  I threw some green onions in.  With the 7 cups of broth, it was enough for 4 people, + 1 days leftovers, which you'll definitely want! Next time I'll bake the meatballs before hand to get some of the grease off.",

If you don't plan on leftovers, the pasta can be cooked in the soup, but you need to go easy on the amount of pasta. She always preferred alphabet pasta.\n\nSecond, she always used either ground turkey or chicken for the meatballs. Also, you need to take it easy on the spices in the meatballs because they can easily overpower the milder flavor of poultry. (By the way, why would anyone use ground beef in a chicken stock--it doesn't make sense, not to mention it isn't authentic.)\n\nThird, she used celery in her recipe. I add a couple of stalks, finely diced. I also up the amount of carrots.\n\nFinally, for an added touch, she always had hard-boiled eggs available for individuals to add, as they chose. It enriches the flavor and texture.\n\nThis recipe is very good--with these few tweaks. Thanks for sharing it.",

For the meatballs, I used 1/2 lb grnd pork, 1/2 lb. grnd beef, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp steak spice and 1 tbsp worchester sauce and froze the rest of meatballs for next batch.  I also browned the meatballs before adding them to the soup. I increased the carrots to 1/2 cup, and decreased the pasta (acini di pepe) to 1/2 cup.  The pasta soaks up alot of liquid, so I cooked it separately and added it when the soup was finished cooking.  I'm definitely making this one again, and recommending it to others!",

I am expected to prepare extraordinary soups and specials on a daily basis...on a limited budget with limited time. My ratings are based on customer response...so take them seriously. I have earned the reputation as the Soup Nazi (Seinfeld  lol).  You MUST MUST MUST let this soup rest overnight before serving to let the flavors fuse together. The first time I made this soup I cooked the orzo seperately, browned the meatballs but thought the broth was bland. I doctored it with basil, garlic and oregano but my shift ended and I gave up trying to fix the soup. When I came to work the next day the soup had sold out...a gallon of soup in 3 hours during a 90 degree Florida heatwave. I now make this regularly, I still doctor the broth but let the soup sit overnite with the meatballs so the basil infuses. I use fresh spinach instead of escarole and make the meatballs the size of my pinky nail so that there are plenty of them. This soup tastes good, looks good and will get you rave reviews.",
