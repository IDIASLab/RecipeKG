        "description": "Sweet potatoes get spiced up! These mashed potatoes are absolutely wonderful with added ginger, roasted garlic, caramelized onions, coconut oil, and a dash of turmeric and curry. No sugar or salt is needed for these wonderful root vegetables! Creme fra&icirc;che adds a creamy texture and offsets the textures of the onions and garlic. I have never had this dish anywhere but at home as my own creation because I am always looking for ways to incorporate ginger, curry, and turmeric into my diet. I love all of the ingredients!",

                "reviewBody": "1.14.21  Several things that I didn\u2019t like about this recipe.  First, garlic gets bitter if cooked too long, and cooking it along with the onions for 10-15 minutes will just about burn it.  Cook the onions, then add the garlic, cooking only  for about 30 seconds to a minute.  Next, by the time the microwaved sweet potatoes are cool enough to handle to peel and scoop out the flesh (recipe doesn[\u2019t even tell you to do this), they\u2019re not as hot as mashed potatoes should be, and you end up with a lukewarm side dish.  I used my mandolin to thinly slice the onions, cut them in half, but they still ended up stringy in the mashed potatoes (really odd?).  I like the savoriness of these potatoes, liked all the ingredients, but did end up adding more turmeric, curry, ginger, and coconut oil for personal taste.  If I were to make these again, rather than microwaving, I think it would be just as easy to peel the potatoes, cut them into cubes, boil until tender, drain and then you\u2019d have HOT sweet potatoes.  I also would coarsely chop the onions rather than slicing them; my husband didn\u2019t care for the sliced onions at all.",
