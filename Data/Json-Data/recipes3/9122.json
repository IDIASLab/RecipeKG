It screams delicious, plus you can make ahead of time which is something we all want more of. When making, you can also add all ingredients to a large resealable plastic bag. Mix and then pour into your serving bowls/glasses. Serve in a fun type of tall stem glass like a martini glass with some crostini on the side.",

I used the fresh wet mozzarella cheese and used my judgement for the amount and used more fresh basil again using my judgement because I love fresh basil. I like to use white balsamic vinegar because it does not discolor lighter colored ingredients and also added some wrinkled black olives which I thought went well. This would be great as an appetizer with sliced grilled bread. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*)",
