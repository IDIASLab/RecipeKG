I baked at 375 degrees to shorten the bake time and blotted the grease from the top of the pepperoni. Wonderful recipe! Enjoyed by adults and children alike! Will make again and again I am sure!",

I made this on Halloween as I knew there would be many people here to help eat it up. We used bagel chips and tortilla chips for dipping. The one thing about the dip that I didn't like was how much grease rose to the top once baked. I think if I would have rinsed the pepperoni (WW trick) before adding it to the dish it would have helped solve that problem. Nice flavor easy to make disappears quickly.

Also instead of just using the pepperoni for the top I chopped it and mixed some into the cheese mixture and put the rest on top before baking. The pic I took is of the dip before it was baked b/c I knew it would be too dark to get a good pic later lol.
