I believe the steps do need a little tweaking because as is I think you could burn the tostones.  Ok, if your tostones are not fully submerged in oil, fry for 2-3 minutes on one side then flip to submerge the other half.  You can also use a Fry Daddy and have it all submerged for 3 minutes.  ONCE THEY COOL OFF, THEN you mash them with something with a flat bottom. A mug or a cup will do nicely. Make sure they're cool or it might come out mushy.  I hate to go against tradition but my tostonera is going to waste because it provides a sideways mashing ability and the tostones come out lopsided.  For tostones, also make sure your plaintain is green.  If its got more yellow than green, it might be too soft for this and is best to be held off for platanos maduros once they darken.  Lastly, I know this may sound weird however, I'd say skip the garlic powder and go with real minced garlic from a jar.  Pour it on the tostones with some juice.  Yes, its raw but the plantain kills its pungency and all you taste is yummy goodness. Salt to taste (light sprinkle will do) and you've got a wonderful side dish on your hands!",

I like to sprinkle garlic salt on them as soon as they come out of the oil. Another fabulous but easy dipping sauce for tostones is mayoketchup. Mayo and Ketchup on a 1:1 ratio (equal amounts), one clove of garlic pressed for each 1/4-1/2 cup of mix, stir, refrigerate about 30 minutes to let flavors come together... VOILA!",
