You can find it at your store usually in the same section you would find veg deli slices and possibly near the water-packed tofu. I highly recommend you give it a try. You can also make it yourself out of vital wheat gluten. There are lots of great recipes out there. My favorite comes from the Post Punk Kitchen website. These burritos were awsome by the way. My bbq addict fiance refused to share.",

I used jalapenos instead of habaneros shredded tempeh instead of seitan and omitted the cilantro & green onions (didn't have them on hand). I added some shredded low-fat cheese and used a mesquite barbeque sauce which added a nice flavor. Next time I may add some corn. For spreading in the pan and coating the burritos I cut the bbq sauce with a bit of water to make it less gloppy and more of a sauce (I used a very thick bbq sauce). I baked it covered with foil then removed the foil for the last 5-10 minutes. That kept the burritos nice and moist. The recipe makes a lot; freeze the leftovers individually for quick microwaveable lunches. This recipe is definitely a keeper and will go into my regular meal rotation!",
