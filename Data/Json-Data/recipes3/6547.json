My bad for forgetting it in the directions.  Sorry, fellow cooks!    With the flour added there should be no problem thickening the sauce.  Well except for Molly...I have no idea what she did to clog a whisk LOL.......:-O",

Worked well and the sauce thickened just enough. Also used sea scallops and sliced in large pieces and they came out great melted in our mouths! Thanks for the recipe!",
