My choice of pasta was ditalini. A garnish of shaved Parmesan hit the spot. All I can say is WOW! I am so happy to have stumbled upon your recipe. Thanks ANGCHICK!:-)",

I thought that I had garlic powder but I didn't so I substituted the salt and garlic pepper for garlic salt which worked out fine. I also added a lot of garlic pepper sauce which added spice which the dish was missing beforehand. Another thing I added was broccoli it was interesting to me that was missing from this dish because it was great! If I make it again I will be sure to add more carrots!",
