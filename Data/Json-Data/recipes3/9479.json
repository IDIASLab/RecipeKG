This is a good, basic recipe; one that easily allows you to embellish upon it, which is what I did.  I used mild Italian sausage, first of all.  After browning it in a little olive oil I added chopped onion, carrots, celery and garlic and sweated those ingredients.  I used my own tomatoes, put up from my garden.  I liked the addition of both beef and chicken broths, but didn\u2019t like the idea of the rigatoni, which is too big a pasta for this. Use something smaller, like shells or even elbow macaroni.   In this case, I used ditalini.  In addition to the ingredients listed I added fresh Swiss chard, the ribs of which I cooked with the celery, carrots and onion, and adding the chopped leaves during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Since pasta absorbs so much liquid, I cooked it first; then added it to the soup at the end.  And how could I forget \u2013 along with the broths and tomatoes I poured in a good couple of glugs of red wine.  I served this with a mix of freshly grated Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano and some freshly baked bread sticks.  As this recipe\u2019s first reviewer I\u2019m happy to report that this is a good, basic recipe, one you can confidently prepare and still feel comfortable to play around with to accommodate whatever pasta or vegetables you have on hand.",

So I searched for recipes using the sausage and this sounded like a hearty simple dish. I did have my doubts but it was very tasty. I didn't add the beans hubby doesn't like beans used elbow Mac. I added splash of red wine but it probably didn't need it. Just play with the seasonings adding veggie ingredients you like.",

We used turkey sweet italian sausage and added a 2 tbsp pouch of  recipe ready tomato paste as well as not one but two small cans of tomato sauce.  I didn't have  garlic or italian seasoning on hand but I put in some garlic powder and 3 tbsp of pesto from a jar and substituted some shredded gruyere cheese for the parmesan.  Even changing it up as I did it was WONDERFUL..  Thank you SO much Louise M Soweski for your fabulous contribution!!!",
