For the flour, I used a combination of almond meal, ground flax seed, and whole wheat instead of all purpose. I left out the walnuts and threw in some chocolate chips.  It is good with chocolate chips, but the bananas make it sweet enough that it would be great with out the chocolate, too.   I just gave my husband one and he LOVED it.  Cutting back our sugar intake isn't going be so bad after all!",

I used 1/2C butter and added 1/2C semi sweet chocolat chips. I am definitely glad I added the chocolate chips because without them they would have been a tad bland. I also have a major sweet tooth so that's why I added them.  They were nice and soft and cake like in texture. I will definitely make these again and when I do I will probably add even more cinnamon just because I like a stronger cinnamon taste.",
