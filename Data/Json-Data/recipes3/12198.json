My Panko crumbs had Parmesan cheese and Italian herbs, so I omitted the parsley. My egg cauliflower blend seemed a little \"wet\" so I added just a little extra panko crumbs. Taking a suggestion from one of the other reviewers, I rolled the tots in more panko crumbs and deep fried the tots. They were great. Will definitely make these again. My grandson liked them. I told him they were tots, but did not say they were cauliflower.",

They have the smooth texture of tots inside but I think you would have to deep fry these to get that crispy \"tot\" exterior. Outer layer is a bit rubbery but worth the less fat.",
