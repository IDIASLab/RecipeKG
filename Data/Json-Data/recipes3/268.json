I also had no idea what Neufchatel cheese was (and still don't!), so I used cream cheese and cut that back to 3 oz.  I probably used more than 1/2 C. peanut butter (so I like peanut butter--sue me!) and used only 1/4 C. milk, but I used whole milk because it's what I keep on hand.  I froze the pie about 3 hours--that seems about right, because this stuff is to die for!  Don't be so concerned with the high calorie count--halve everything, in fact.  This pie is very rich, so you'll probably get sixteen pieces out of this rather than the eight the recipe says you'll get.",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent! I have made this twice in two weeks. To get it down to 226 calories and made it more peanut buttery I did the following: Cut the powdered sugar to 2/3 cup; Used 1/3 fat cream (Neufchatel like recipe calls for); Used Fat Free whipped cream; Added peanut butter to 1/2 cup PLUS 2 Tbls This recipe is VERY rich. Careful on adding too much PB. I think just adding 2 Tbls is perfect. By adding extra that adds sweetness so I was able to cut the powdered sugar down. The pie tastes more refreshing when it is frozen solid. I drizzled choc. syrup on each slice after it was plated. This makes for a nicer looking presentation. I did not use sugar free choc though......so little is used and there is nothing like the real thing! This is an awesome recipe! I love peanut butter and I love saving calories! It tastes so rich and delicious! I have made it twice and gotten many raves about it! Also it is very very easy to make. The most time consuming part is freezing it.",

I used regular cream cheese and 2% milk made a crust using chocolate graham crackers and put it all in a 10-inch deep dish pie plate. My son had tasted it some place asked for the recipe saying it tasted like peanut butter fudge except that it's cold. It tastes like I expected and there isn't any doubt it's a peanut butter pie. I'll make this recipe again. It will also be added to our menus for family get togethers. Thank you for sharing it for others to make as well Donna.",
