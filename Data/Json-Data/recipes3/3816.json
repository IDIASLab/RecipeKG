And keep in mind that you can swap out the Parmesan for another cheese to mix it up a little. For example Gorgonzola works great. If using a different cheese rely on taste as opposesd to the given measurements as stronger cheeses will require less and vice versa.",

One change I would make is to lessen the saffron by half or to taste. 1 tsp turned out to be quite a lot and it made the dish extremely aromatic, which is not a negative, however as a side dish the flavor was a tad overwhelming. One thing I would note to new risotto makers is the cooking time and the amount of broth are completely subject to external factors. So just keep tasting it as you go and it should be perfectly dente when the husk on the rice begins to become transparent. ",
