I used normal tomatoes because I didn't have cherry tomatoes on hand and used toasted the pine nuts to bring out the flavor. I also added cranberries, which I think are a must. The sweetness compliments with the spicy/bitter arugula. My one last suggestion to let this salad sit for a few minutes. It tastes better that way. This is a keeper. I'll definitely make it again.",
