I assumed you could just buy it at the grocery store and no wonder everyone there looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if they knew what it was because I came home and googled it and I guess you have to actually make it with milk flour and some other ingredients. I bought frozen spinach in a cream sauce and just did w/o the bechamel. It was really good still...just really thick. I mixed in some alfredo sauce I had in the fridge which didn't really change the consistency much but seemed to bring out more flavor. Good but not as easy as it seems b/c you have to make the bechamel. Is there another way to do this w/o making the sauce?",

                "reviewBody": "OK this recipe is a 5 with some important modifications. No canned slimy spinach; I use a 16 oz. bag of frozen and cook it in the microwave and squeeze the excess moisture out. I use a giant skillet and saute the onion first in a tiny bit of olive oil adding at least a TBSP of crushed fresh garlic near the end of the sauteing. I like artichoke hearts in mine coarsely chopped and add all the rest of the ingredients except the parmesan and cheddar in and heat stirring until incorporated and bubbly. (Also I like to use a sundried tomato alfredo sauce but the bechamel will work ok.) Finally I add the last cheeses in though usually my proprotions are more like 1 cup of parmesan 1 cup of cojack and 1/2 cup of mozzarella. Sea salt to taste and it might need a little more cayenne if you want a more significant kick. However this is not a BAD recipe as it is just doesn't quite have enough oomph without the above modifications. And my way the recipe is completely cooked on the stovetop no lengthy stays in a crockpot or extra baking in the oven.",

So this time I made it as a pasta sauces but I did make some changes. I change the bechamel sauce for sundried tomato alfredo sauce I used two jars this time instead of one that I use for the dip. I also have used fresh spinach and frozen about half and half finely cut the fresh and drain most of the water out of the frozen spinach like what has been said before. When adding the cheeses I like to pour the graded cheese slowly and keep stirring until all of the cheese is in then let it simmer being careful not to burn it but to melt all the cheeses into the sauce. i will next time put some chicken or shrimp to it. I know this is a dip recipe but it can work and everyone enjoyed it have fun and enjoy cooking",

I used a bechamel recipe from this site - which compliments the spinach nicely (the nutmeg is a natural partner for spinach) I used the colby jack-mozzerella combination recommended by another reviewer (1 1/2 c. to 1/2 c.) and cut the parm in half. I halved the recipe and it was plenty for a small party. I made this recipe because I needed to use up my leftover fresh baby spinach so I chopped up the remaining 1/2 bag and that amount was good for a half recipe of this dip so I guess a full bag if I make the entire recipe next time. I also pre-sauteed the onion with a clove of minced garlic and sauteed the spinach for just a fraction of a minute and added it all to the melted cheese mixture and simmered for a few minutes on low heat.
