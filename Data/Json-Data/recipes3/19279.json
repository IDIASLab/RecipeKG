Reading the previous reviews helped a lot in making it even better. I would like to share these little Improvements with all.( It took only 10 minutes to prepare! ) My husband and I totally love it! Improvements: To avoid having it dry out I used a round Pyrex with lid. I use a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I also added 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice 1 tbsp of olive oil 2 tbsp ginger (gourmet spice blend) (fresh ginger would be even better) 3 gloves of garlic and lots of ground pepper. Do not add any salt! The soy sauce and the soups have already plenty of it. I serve it with mash potatoes and peas. Simple very juicy and very very YUMMY! Thank you! Will make it again for sure!",

Like the other posts I could not find the cream of chicken mix so I used 1/2 a small can of cream of chicken soup. I think next time I make this I'll not use as much as the onion soup mix to cut the salty and the onion. Its good and easy to make. Since the first time I made it I've made it several times. I did what I did before w/ the cream of ckn soup and I did not use the onion soup mix fixed the saltyness. Its one of my favorites and I shared it w/ my mom and friends.",
