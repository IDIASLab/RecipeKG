I baked for 25 minutes at 175 C and it almost burned the top but the bottom was soggy. I used a 9\" round cake pan as described in the notes. So low and slow may be the key to a uniform doneness. I used coconut oil for vegetable oil and added some dark chocolate chips on top. Thank you for the recipe.",

I didn't cook the bananas but instead used very ripe ones and mashed them with the oil and honey. I thru in a handful of semi-sweet chips. Baked it at 350 for 30 minutes and while it looked done I kept an eye on it for another 10 to see if it would pull from the edges which it began to do. I took it out of the oven let it sit for 5 minutes ran a knife around the edges to pull away. It was real spongy. We ate it a few hours later and it was quite good. A bit mushy the next day. I'd make it again if I was in the same pinch!",
