I used 3 cups of Nestle's white chocolate chips and no-brand sweetened condensed milk with  great results.  Fudge set up perfectly.  I had the holiday oreos with the red cream centers.  Heated until chips were just melted then gently folded in the cookies.  It made a red/white marbled affect; very pretty and festive.  Thanks for the great tip of not crushing too fine.  Cut each cookie with a serated knife and threw away all the fine crumbs.  Nice texture.  Thanks for the easy recipe!",

Being that it's almost Halloween, I wanted something fun and yummy, but not cupcakes or sugar cookies like everyone else brings. After melting the chocolate and condensed milk, I added about 12 drops of yellow food coloring and 5 drops or red, and mixed it well, then folded in the cookies. I found it was easier to break the cookies by hand into 4 or 5 pieces than to cut them, that made more crumbs. I also used a 9x13 pan so it's easier to cut small portions.  If you are making this for a lot of people (more than 20 kids or 10 adults) then you may want to double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan. Also, spread into the pan while it's still a little warm! Mine wouldn't spread out nicely, so I put a sheet of wax paper on top and then pressed across that to spread it evenly, and that worked wonderfully.  ",

Don't crush them in a plastic bag by banging the cookies with something (like a cup.) It will make the presentation not so good. Break each cookie in about 4 or 5 pieces and leave it. Trust me, it makes for better looking (and non gritty) fudge. I made this for a family birthday party, and everyone kept going back for more. My grandpa (who rarely eats any sweets), wanted to fill up a container for himself to eat! Many of my friends find this fudge addictive, and I have to agree. Excellent recipe.",

I used 18 ounces (or approximately 3 cups) of Nestle white chocolate chips, a 14 ounce can of Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, a pinch of salt and about 1/2 of a 1 lb. 2 oz. package of Oreo cookies.  I broke each Oreo in 4 to 5 pieces while the other ingredients were melting together over low heat.  Once the chocolate chips were completely melted, I gently folded in the broken Oreo cookies.  I poured the fudge into an 8x4 inch bread pan which I lined with aluminum foil and sprayed lightly with cooking spray.  The result was a tall fudge like the kind you see at fudge shops.  This recipe was incredible and I love the simplicity of the preparation.  Tastes just like Hershey's Cookies 'N' Cream bars, only better!",
