I didn't have sweet potato on hand so I subbed in zucchini raw and added a 1/4 cup more oats for soaking up moisture. I also added an egg because I added more mushrooms because I love them. Definitely a win! I'll be making them again. Making them thicker is ideal. I don't suggest a thin burger even if you think you like that type usually it's very crumbly that way. Enjoy!",
