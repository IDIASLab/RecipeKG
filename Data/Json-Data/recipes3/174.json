(And I couldn't stop tasting it, telling myself I had to make sure it was sweet enough, chocolatey enough, the proper consistency, etc., etc...yeah, right) It is light, fluffy, and mildly chocolate - just like French Silk Pie! It spreads like a dream and makes the cake look like you just have to dive right in for a piece.  Wanting to make sure I had enough to amply frost a layer cake I scaled the recipe to 18 servings and it was just the right amount.  Using pre-melted unsweetened chocolate in the envelopes made this a snap to make quickly. Didn't have milk but I had cream leftover from \"Whipped Cream Cake II\" and it worked well.  Awesome good frosting.",

Most chocolate frosting recipes are too thick and heavy but this is very close to the flavor and texture of French Silk Pie! I LOVE THIS FROSTING! It frosted and filled my 8 inch layer cake well and I added just a splash more milk...I might double it for a 9 inch layer cake cause it's SOOOO GOOD!! Truly outstanding...light and chocolaty!",
