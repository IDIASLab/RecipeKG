Of course I changed it a little to reflect what I had on hand.: ) I used Rotini noodles which picked up the flavor of the sauce well. I browned the ground beef onion garlic salt and pepper together. Then I added a can of tomato sauce a can of diced tomatoes and a can of mushroom soup. (I don't like mushrooms themselves but like the added flavor the soup gave this dish.) My husband used Parmesan cheese on his plate but the kids liked it just the way it was. Thanks for a great recipe!",

Mamow's method not only seasoned the pasta but thickened the sauce at the same time. We never had mushrooms in our Slumgullion.",

I use spiral macaroni and add green bell pepper (great flavor) to the pan when browning. I empty everything into a large pyrex bowl and bake at 350 for a half hour or 45 min depending on how much. Great dish everyone loves it and its so easy. Don't forget to top with romano or parmegan cheese. It brings me right back to my youth every time.",

Occasionally years later Dad would recall eating \"slum\" every day on the ship. He wouldn't eat anything like that any more. I had not heard the name in about 70 years!!",
