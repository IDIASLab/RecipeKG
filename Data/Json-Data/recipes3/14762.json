I always have mushrooms in my fridge so this was a nice change of what I usually do with them. I used a combo of white, baby portobello, and some random mixed mushrooms that were on sale.  Looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow. Thanks!\nEDIT:  There are no leftovers.  I ate all of it.  The entire pan.  This dish is amazing - just the way it is.  If you're thinking, \"This seems too simple to be this amazingly tasty\" you're wrong.  It's like mushrooms and sour cream were meant to be together and who are we as mere humans to fight this partnership?  \nJust do it.  Make this.",
