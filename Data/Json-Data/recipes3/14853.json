I really didn't understand the coating of flour either but I made the recipe as written and planned to give it another chance. Also this is not for the calorie counters but keep in mind nor is the roast beef with yorkshire pudding. My family loved it and I'm willing to give it a chance without the added oil.",

I took the advice of others and did not put the extra oil in at least not initially. the chicken I used was a very lean young chicken and it literally produced maybe ONE tablespoon of grease if that! So after I cooked the chicken for 1hr I added about about a 1/4 cup of coconut oil (since that is what I had on hand) and then poured in the batter and it turned out awesome! I should note though since I am allergic to milk I substituted 1 cup coconut milk and 1/2 cup of hazlenut milk for the 1 and 1/2 cups of milk and i couldn't tell it was milk free at all it tasted amazing and my milk loving husband liked it too! I might reduce the oil just a tad next time but maybe to about 1/6 depending on what the next chicken produces. But wonderfully tasty dish and is very hearty it will keep you full for a long time I ate a small serving with mashed potatoes and some zuccini 5hrs ago and I am not even a little bit hungry now! Very very good! I am a huge fan of English food and if you are too its definitely worth trying!:) God Bless Amy",
