With that said I felt that these could almost be bland. Their saving grace was the addition of raisins and walnuts that give you a little pop of flavor when you bite into them. If I were to make these again I think they could really benefit from the addition of a little fat--1-2 tbsps of butter or oil would do the trick. Also a bit more spices maple syrup in place of honey and maybe even some shredded coconut would add a bit more flavor. These cookies also stay EXACTLY how they go into the oven--no spreading at all. After the first batch I pressed them flat before baking and much prefer them that way. Overall not bad but I would adjust more to suit my family's tastes. Thanks for the recipe!",
