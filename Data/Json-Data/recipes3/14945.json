I used all the other ingredients except I switched out raw honey instead of agave. Honestly they just didn t have enough flavor for me. The 6 eggs dumbed down the pumpkin flavor. I didn t add the nuts since my son doesn t like them. But I added some unsweetened shredded coconut to the top of some. That added some texture. But the ones without coconut on top went pretty flat when I took them out of the oven... strange. Anywhooooo won t be making these again unless my son asks for them.",
