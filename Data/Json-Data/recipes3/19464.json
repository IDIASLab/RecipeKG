I would say don't bother adding the cloves or nutmeg - the cinnamon is so overwhelming that you don't really smell either one and it's a waste of expensive spices. I dried them in the oven and some cracked and others heaved a little. If you have the time to air dry them do it that way. You'll be happier with the finished product.",

I used a cup of applesauce and skipped the glue because it is not necessary and makes the dough harder to work with. Plastic throw-away gloves are a good idea. This recipe made 9 ornaments. (size shown in photo) I found a dollar store is the best place to purchase cinnamon for this project and I use the cheap store brand applesauce. Because I made the ornaments a bit thick I tried cooking them in the oven at 200. After a couple hours when they were getting near done I noticed they were starting to curl. I took them out immediately and allowed them to air dry. I first made this recipe about 20 years ago and the ornaments are as good as ever. I do nothing special to store them just pack them away with the rest of the Christmas tree balls.",
