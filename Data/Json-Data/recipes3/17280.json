It was a little under 3 pounds. I set the temp and time for 350 @ 30 minutes. I placed it skin side down and flipped it halfway. When I checked the temp it was about 120 degrees. I added another 8 minutes. Checked again 140. I add another 10 minutes and let it rest for 8. When I cut it it was undercooked at the bone. I sliced it and put the lice\u2019s in the air fryer for 5 minutes it was tough. I\u2019ll try it again and make sure to time it with the rest of dinner.",
