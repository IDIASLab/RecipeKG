The only thing I might change about this recipe is to add a dash of fresh lemon juice and a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. One warning: please don't forget to grease your baking dish! Use Pam olive oil or even butter - just make sure you grease the bottom and sides! I forgot and my Pyrex baking pan wound up being a mess of browned-on egg that was quite a chore to clean.",
