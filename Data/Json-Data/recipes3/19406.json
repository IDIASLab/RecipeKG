It adheres to the pretzels VERY well (better than chips and cream).  I melt the chocolate bark over a double boiler so it doesn't burn and then dip the pretzel rod or round in the chocolate, lay them all on wax paper and put in freezer.  Then after hard, I redip again, roll in crushed candy (peanuts, sprinkles, M&Ms, rieces peanuts, or drizzle  melted white chocolate) and freeze until hard again.  DELICIOUS and beautiful.",
