Neither of us seemed to mind it as it wasn't overpoweringly salty. (I should have tasted it before adding additional salt) I don't keep wine or sherry on hand but I did have white cooking wine and cooking sherry so there wasn't an alcohol taste like some of the other reviewers found. Since there was only two of us eating I cut the recipe in half except for the garlic I still crushed up 2 cloves and it was perfect. I served this with beer bread cooked chicken (seasoned with salt and pepper) apples and veggies. We both loved it!",
