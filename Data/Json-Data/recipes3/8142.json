The changes I made were to use all bison instead of beef/pork bouillon cube instead of chicken broth and whole milk instead of cream. Bouillon cubes are generally saltier than broth. I should have reduced the salt in the meat mix but I didn't so mine came out too salty. Otherwise it was pretty darn good and I'll make it again. Some things about the recipe that confused me: the leaves on bottom and top? The leaves are pretty small relative to the pan size and didn't seem to do anything? Was I missing something? It didn't say to cover the dish so I didn't. However the broth only covered the rolls half way and the top half of the rolls were crispy and dry with the bottom half boiled. Made the texture really odd. Next time I'll cover it. I used the leaves off three beet roots. I am not sure how many leaves I had but I doubt it was 36. Even with less leaves I still ran out of filling and had to make more filling. Update: Made again using low sodium broth and covering the pan with aluminum foil during baking. Texture was good. In the future I'll reduce salt in meat and use regular sodium broth. Update 2: We regularly get beets with greens in our CSA box and I make this every time. Once I was short on time. Instead of rolling the filling into the leaves I tore up the leaves into small pieces threw them in the bottom of the pan put the meat mix on top added the broth covered and threw it i",
