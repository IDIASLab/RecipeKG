The only changes I made were the addition of peas (next time will probably add broccoli snow peas etc.) and i didn't have cashews so i toasted some almond slivers and sesame seeds and i think they were a fine substitution. i added a litle more ginger than called for. I thought the blend of flavors in the sauce was just outstanding and everyone said it smelled and tasted fabulously. very good recipe only change i would make would be the addition of more vegetables.",

Using the first TBLS of oil I cooked the celery and carrots and added 1 head of chopped broccoli 1/2 red and 1/2 green bell pepper chopped 1/2 cup frozen snow pea pods and 1/4 cup sliced fresh mushrooms. After stir frying them I added the chicken (and added an extra 1/2 lb more than what the recipe calls for). In addition I doubled the \"sauce.\" The result was delicious. Although kids who are picky with their veggies may not enjoy it as much this recipe is one that you can cater to what you enjoy. My five year old loves it and got a kick out of eating the cashew topping. I was hoping that the sauce would be sweeter in taste and next time I might add a tsp of orange zest or something but overall it was really good and sooo easy to make. I will be making this more often. What a tasty way to eat your veggies!!",

                "reviewBody": "The flavor on this was outstanding. The orange was just right and the sesame oil was a very good \"secret\" ingredient. I agree though with the other reviews on the sweetness or hotness - it needed a little more of one or the other. I added a little more sweetness in the form of mirin and that worked great. I might try hot pepper sauce the next time for hotness! Also per other reviews I doubled the sauce and added extra veggies. I'm glad I did because I don't think there would've been enough for our family of 6. I added zucchini pea pods bean sprouts garlic and even spinach. The only thing I would suggest is to cook the chicken first for two reasons one is for sanitary reasons. I didn't like that I was putting raw chicken on my veggies. The other reason was that the veggies got too soggy after being in there so long. I prefer them a little crunchier and so does my husband. All in all a great dish.",

I left out the celery and didn't add nuts because my husband does not like them in stir fry and I added about a tablespoon and a half to make it a little sweeter. I also added a little garlic and salt and pepper to taste which is not mentioned in the recipe. This will be how I make stir fry from now on. Oh and I also used olive oil and it turned out just great. I might try sunflower seed oil next time. Thanks for a great recipe.",
