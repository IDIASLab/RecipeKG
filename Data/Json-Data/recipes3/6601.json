The sweetness of the peas really compliments the spice of the pepper.",

This didn't seem particularly spicy to us maybe my jalapeno was abnormally mild even though I didn't take the seeds and membrane out of it. I used a combination of reduced fat mayo and fat free sour cream and did not add any cheese only to keep the weight watchers points down. I cut up a big ol' kosher dill pickle instead of using relish and I hesitated about putting in the egg but compromised and used two hard boiled egg whites (I fed the yolks to the cats). We loved the combination of flavors but next time I'll make sure my jalapeno has some punch. Thanks so much for the post Shunpr!",
