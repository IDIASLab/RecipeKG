No where does the recipe state where or what amounts to divide it into or mix it into. Second - In Mary's defense she calls for 1/4 c. of powdered milk. All I could find was nonfat so I used that. If there is indeed a powdered full-fat milk product I'd be hard pressed to find it. A very \"eggy\" thin donut almost like a thick pancake. I was looking for something more \"cake-like\". Even with 2 t. baking powder (it was fresh baking powder) there was still little to no rise. The one other review gave this four stars so I figured I'd give it a shot (especially since I'm trying to find a decent recipe for my donut pans and have yet to). I consider myself to be a decent baker. Yes my oven temperature is on the money. I'm sure these are healthy but they're very bland and with poor texture. I don't even think a glaze/frosting/10X sugar could save these babies. Sorry.",
