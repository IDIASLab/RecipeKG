First I used a full pound of Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage browned it on the stovetop and then cut in diagonal slices. I recommend starting with maybe 1 tsp. of the crushed red pepper and adding more if you want more spice. I used 2 heaping tsp. of minced garlic and sauteed it in a pan with olive oil a whole onion sliced very thin and 2 cups of fresh sliced mushrooms (after removing the stems). Then I added it to the sauce ingredients and simmered for 45-60 minutes on the stove. I also added 1 tbsp. of cocoa powder to the sauce. It cut the bite out of the tomatoes and made the sauce a deep rich red/brown. I served it with a fresh salad and crusty bread. Yummy.",
