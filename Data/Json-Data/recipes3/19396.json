I don't know if they stay in a round ball if you refrigerate them but they were pretty with just a domed shape top when I cooked them right after mixing. Did discover they were better when I made them bite size. Cooking time was shorter since I didn't put them in the fridge first. I tried sifting the sugar on them but it didn't stick so I rolled them in powdered sugar once when hot then again when cooler as suggested in a previous review. I was confused by \"knead in flour by hand until completely mixed\" so I just mixed in flour with a wooden spoon until it was thick enough to put on counter and then kneaded(if thats a word?) the rest of the flour in. Oh I dusted the counter top with powdered sugar so the dough wouldn't stick.",

I'm baking them right now (my husband has already eaten 5 and said they are addictive) I have Martha Stewart's cookie cook book and she has almost the same version of Mexican Wedding cookies in it. To make them more like she does toast the almonds in the oven first at 350 degrees f until slightly golden it brings out the flavor of the almonds reduce the flour to 2 cups and 2 tablespoons flour up the confectioners sugar to 1 cup and swap one of the teaspoons of vanilla for almond extract I just rolled the dough into 1 1/2 inch balls straight from the bowl. These are also a great cookie just the way the recipe is written don't forget altitude and climate affect your baking while more flour works for some less might work better for others.
