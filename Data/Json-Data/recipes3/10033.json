The dish is quite tasty when you have the mandarin orange relish and fish in your mouth it is absolutely sublime.  I can\u2019t eat cilantro so I did not add it. I also substituted fresh mandarin oranges (clementine) for the canned. The only down is the initial smell which is why the 4 star rating. Finicky family members liked it too so we will repeat it.",
