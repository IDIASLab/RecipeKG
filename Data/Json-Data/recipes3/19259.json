I did turn the broiler on for an extra few minutes to crisp the bacon to our preferences.... Thank you 07/10/05 Review 2 - Stil 5 Stars! I have made this so many times and have found the best way to make this by following the recipe exactly as is. Too much flavor is lost if you cook the bacon beforehand. I always turn on the broiler to brown the bacon during the last few minutes and turn it over to brown the other side too.",

So easy and can make with different soups for totally different flavors. So far I have used celery soup mushroom potato and nacho cheese. Didn't care for it with the nacho cheese soup though. Season chicken first with pepper garlic poultry seasoning whatever you like. I'd check the soup first to see if it's salty before adding any salt! Don't forget the bacon is pretty salty too. This is the first recipe I ever made from this site back in June 2005 and my husband LOVES it second to Burrito Pie.",

I also used more milk than what the recipe called for but its really a matter of preference on how thick you want your gravy. YUMMY!!!",
