Super easy snack and could always have the ingredients on hand if you keep the sausage in your freezer for those times friends pop in.",

I ve used Hillshire Farm Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage (50% less fat) for years and that s what I used for this recipe. I spread a sheet of foil out on the baking pan so cleanup for this recipe also was a breeze. Next time I ll cut the sausage just a bit thicker and take out of the oven at 18 minutes (personal taste preference). When football season is in full swing I can see this as a go-to game day snack. You could make the dipping sauce the day before cut up additional sausage and store in a zip-top bag and then when you need more it ll be so easy to make another batch. Not only was the sausage delicious the honey mustard sauce was the perfect partner and strong enough to stand on its own for so many other dishes. This one s a keeper for sure.",

For ease I used the bake function on my air fryer and they are done in 5-7 minutes per tray. The dip no one really cared for. I think more of a spicy mustard would have been better. This dip tasted more like mayo. I will more likely make the sausage with brown sugar again though for an easy appetizer. Ty so much.",
