The only issue I had was the cornbread mix called for 1 C milk and two eggs. Since I wasn't sure i should add the extra liquid, I followed the recipe and used just 3/4 cup milk and 1 egg. It turned out great although not nearly as pretty in the photo, since there wasn't quite enough of the cornbread mix to completely cover the dish for baking. Kids still loved it. I  used a 6 qt. Dutch oven without the lid. I checked it at 20 mins, and felt it could use an extra 5 mins, so it was done in 25 mins. Garnished w/sour cream and cheddar cheese according to taste.",
