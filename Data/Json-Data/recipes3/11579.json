I used 2 lbs of ground turkey, 2 eggs, and 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and 1 tablespoon of garlic powder to get the basic mix. I then seasoned them according to this recipe. For the sauce, you do NOT need 32 oz of both BBQ sauce and jelly! I just used what I had (maybe 16 oz??) of each and that was more than enough! It even allowed for extra after coating the meatballs to then pour extra over the meatballs! They're delicious!",
