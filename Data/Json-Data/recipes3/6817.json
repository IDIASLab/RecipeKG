If you follow this recipe as written using 1T filling per wonton you will use exactly 1/2 of the 12oz pkg of wonton wrappers. 1T is about as full as you would want a wonton to get so you could cut the filling per wonton in half to fill all of the wrappers. I'm sure mincing tenderloin in the food processor for this is lovely but I used purchased ground pork because I'm a cheapskate about grinding expensive cuts of meat. I followed the rest as written - very nice. Thanks!",
