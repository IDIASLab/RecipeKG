I also decided not to defrost the frozen spinach because I thought that it would add moisture, and I only used one 14oz bag.  To the tofu mixture to add some zest and nutrition, I added about two heaping tablespoons of white miso and about 3/4 cup of nutritional yeast.  \nThis lasagne turned out perfectly moist and very flavorful!",

In this sauce I simply used 2 additional cans of stewed tomatoes, about 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, a crushed clove of garlic and some salt and pepper.  It was great!\r\n\r\nAlso, this recipe can probably serve 12 people, so cook accordingly!",

I was happy to find a lasagna recipe that was dairy-fee and egg-free but still had to alter it a little more to fit my food allergies by using rice lasagna noodles. The other alterations I made were to cut down prep time, as I prefer quick recipes. So...I used the oven-ready noodles and suggest this for those who found this recipe too time-consuming. I also used a jar of organic robust marinara sauce to avoid the time it takes to make my own sauce. So the only prep I had to do was season the tofu and layer the dish. I added cumin to the tofu mixture and used \"Italian Seasoning\" in lieu of the basil/parsley. This is exactly what it needed to add flavor. Cumin rounded it all out. I used pre-washed baby spinach leaves and they cooked well in the oven. My cheese-loving-meat-eating-tofu-fearing husband said, \"this is good! wait... how did you make this without cheese?\" When I told him it was tofu, he turned his nose up and said it wasn't half bad for tofu. So as long as he didn't know what was in it, he loved it. I will make this the same way again. Took me only 10 min to prepare and 45min - 1hr to cook, which couldn't be easier.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was a lot of work. I don't mind that, as long as the end result is fantastic - and this one was not.  I did not really like it, it just tasted basically like a big pile of stewed tomatoes with spinach.  Some changes I would consider are: using (seasoned) spaghetti sauce instead of the whole homemade-sauce-with-stewed-tomatoes business; also I thought about possibly mixing some vegan imitation sour cream with the tofu to try to get a more creamy consistency; it also needs more spices (maybe some vegetable soup mix with the tofu?).  I also thought there was WAY too much spinach in this.  Note, this did taste better on the second day, but it still needs some changes for my tastes.",
