I melt the butter at the lowest heat setting then once melted I sift about 1/2tsp to 1tsp cornstarch to the butter and stir untill most of the cornstarch is blended with the butter (to make a rue).  Another thing I have done is added 1/4 tsp Cheyenne pepper to the mixture along with the salt and chili pepper.those were the only changes I made to it and its GREAT!! My Hubby is a picky eater and he gave me the 2 thumbs up and even asks me to make it for dinner.  I have also let my God son try it and he LOVES it and always asks for 2nd's (which is rare!!).  I hope my comment helps anyone out there wanting to try it or who has already tried it but wanted to try something a little different.",

I thought it went into the dish and it was just a garnish I don't need garnish at my house because the meal speaks for itself. The lime could have been eliminated as well. My boyfriend rated it at a 4 then i told him to have some lime with it he did then he then rated it a 3. I did however make the cilantro lime rice to serve the shrimp on from this website. I made the 2nd recipe that comes up in the search results--bad idea if you do not like cilantro.",
