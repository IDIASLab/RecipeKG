My whole family were falling over each other for seconds. And now my wife and kids are asking me to prepare it again for our New Years get together. It's it hit! Thank you so much for this great recipe. I'm substituting the arugula and fresh basil leaves today with fresh spinich leaves which I believe will be tasty.
