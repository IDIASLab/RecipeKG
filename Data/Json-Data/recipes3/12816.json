It's very popular with my customers and my girlfriend loves it. Why not try it with a big lump of mature Cashel blue cheese melted on the top and a wild mushroom sauce poured over it all? Very heavy and full of fat but great as a treat every now and then.",

I baked this in a flat pie dish and it stuck a bit to the bottom but the top had a nice beautiful brown delicious goldeness to it. I transferred into individual serving dishes (as shown in the picture) which made it not as pretty but the flavor was still there. My only recommendation is to double the butter and spring onion. It definitely needed more onion in my opinion.",
