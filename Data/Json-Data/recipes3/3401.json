Mixed.  Stuffed celery with it.  Dipped cukes in it.  Spread it on my portabella burger.  Used it as a thicker dressing for my salad.  Dipped sweet potato fries in it.  All amazing delish!  It's kid approved, niece approved, and BF added it into the keeper list.  Thanks for a delicious twist for my low carb diet!",

The other adjustment was that I used 8oz of nonfat cream cheese instead of the mayo and it was a better consistency and tasty. Also added salt and white pepper to taste. I didn't have the exact ingredients the second time so I substituted almond slices and green pepper and it was still delicious. Great base recipe to tweak to your liking.",
