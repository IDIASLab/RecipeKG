However a few changes would make it perfectly to-die-for: 1) bake a graham cracker or even better a shortbread crust instead of the puff pastry 2) Try to add some orange flavouring or grated orange zest to the chocolate mixture 3) Bake it in a 8\" tart pan for a thicker chocolate experience. Made this way I think this recipe would really deserve 5 stars at least.",

The only change I made was the size of the tart pan - mine was 11\". To weight the pastry down I used a 10\" round cake pan and put a baking dish inside. I made the filling exactly as stated and it's delicious. I did top with homemade whipped cream and puff pastry hearts (made from scraps) with a little melted chocolate drizzled on top. This is a very elegant dessert. Seems a lot of people \"fear the puff pastry\" when there's no reason. This dessert simply wouldn't be the same in a graham cracker crust but to each his own.",

Pre-baked the tarts.(using the \"baking bind\" method)Putting them aside to cool. For the filling: I used 2 cups of table cream 18% 3/4 cup sugar 2 eggs 1/3 cup corn starch. Once that cooked over a double boiler(easy tip--- is to use an electric hand mixer set on the slowest setting for the long cook. About 20 minutes on my stove)until thickened I added semi-sweet bakers chocolate 4 of the 8 large squares. (approx. 4 oz) Slow beat mixture until all the chocolate was melted thoroughly and glossy.(about 5 minutes)I then pulled the pot off the heat and folded in 1 cup flaked/shredded coconut. Spooned the the whole mixture into the cooled tarts with a small laddle to just below the main rim of each tart. Added a sprinkle of toasted coconut to the top........Placed the tarts in the fridge to set fully and cool completely. Wonderful goodness to my surprise.",
