I did notice some differences though I use 3 cans of Great Northern Beans 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt cube the chicken instead of \"shredding it\" & saute it by itself use 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of 4 and after adding the cornmeal to thicken I then simmer the chili for 45 minutes stirring very often to prevent sticking - The chili gets nice and thick. I serve this with tortilla chips and I think Fresh Chopped Cilantro (although optional)adds another taste dimension to this Chili. We top with shredded cheese and sour cream. Add the Hot Sauce to your taste after the Chili is done.",
