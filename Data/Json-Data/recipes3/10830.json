I used about 2/3rds a cup of Panko but kept the cheese and seasoning amounts the same (and ended up with enough left over for another zucchini). I used a Cajun seasoning blend instead of Italian since we had a spicy spinach and feta turkey burger with them but am sure the Italian would be just as tasty. We will definitely have again.",

I salted the zucchini before breading. However I did not have regular Italian seasoning on hand so I used salt-free Italian seasoning. This may have been why the zucchini fries did not seem quite salty enough for my taste. The next time I make this recipe I will try using regular Italian seasoning or use Panko bread crumbs with Italian seasoning added. I think a little garlic powder would also add additional flavor.",
