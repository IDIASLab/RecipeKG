I have made the recipe several times, with many variations on veggies, meat, and cheese and have never been disappointed.  Its very versatile.  However, two things I think are key to the flavor are the tarragon, and the small splash of vinegar.  I usually double the tarragon because it adds so much flavor to the quiche.  For meat, I've used ham, Jimmy Dean sage sausage, bacon, and leftover rib roast.  For cheese, I've used cheddar, jalapeno, feta, and monterey jack/colby.  I always use fresh mushrooms instead of canned and shallots instead of onions is  a great improvement too.  ",

I used Jimmy Dean Sausage and red and orange bell peppers instead of the green... gave it a little more color and I just like red peppers much more than green. I also replaced the onions with shallots as another reviewer suggested and used fresh garlic and mushrooms (I added them to the cooked sausage and saute all the vegetable etc together in one pan) I agree that the tarragon and nutmeg really add the wonderful flavor to this quiche! Thought I'd freeze the second quiche but it was eaten before it made it to the freezer. Will make this again and again I'm sure!",
