During the prep I had a hard time getting the salami to cover up all of the cheese. I mixed a couple of tablespoons cream cheese in with shredded pepper jack for the filling which helped it stay in the jalepeno. The toothpicks burned on the grill (not the recipe's fault though). I think bacon instead of salami would work better for next time because it has a higher fat content and would be less likely to burn around the edges as the salami did. I'll update this if I actually get to taste one next time.",

So I made a few changes to suit our tastes.I stuffed the jalepeno w/ pepper jack cheese to add extra bite marinated the chicken in a blend of olive oil balsamic vinegar various spices and hot pepper sauces (we like it hot!) and wrapped them in bacon rather than salami. We have pan fried these and also grilled them but think the best combination is to sear them on the stove top to seal in the juices and crisp up the bacon then pop them into the oven to finish cooking. AWESOME AND TASTY! I give this 5 stars for a super inspiration recipe.",
