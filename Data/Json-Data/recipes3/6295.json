I like to just get the frozen shrimp in the bag. It's cheaper that way but it does take a little more time if you get the ones you have to peel. I think it's more than worth it! I have a few other recipes that have been submitted for a while now. I am hoping that they will eventually get published. Thanks again and enjoy",

Also since this is entitled \"Indian\" I decided to make it more Indian in preparation by substituting the sesame oil with ghee and roasted the curry powder (home made) in the ghee before adding garlic ginger and mango. This brings out the spice and flavor of the curry powder. I also added a sliced thai chili. This really brought the heat. Also I garnished the dish with the cilantro (and lime wedges) instead of cooking. Delicious!",
