        "description": "This recipe comes from chats with friends and many weekend mornings of making biscuits. Pay close attention to technique -- it is certainly as important as the ingredients -- and you'll surely make a moist, airy, tasty biscuit with good rise. Important: Use fresh, aluminum-free baking powder; this is less salty than regular baking powder and allows you to add more without affecting taste.",

Give these a try.... you might want to make them a little shorter to ensure they are done in the middle.... (We went too tall and just took the tops off and kept ) but try them and prepared be impressed.",
