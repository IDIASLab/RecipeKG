Be careful when pouring the topping mixture over the marshmallows, or you might cave in the middle. I had marshmallows coming up the sides of the pan, so next time when I pour on the topping, I'll do it slowly and in spoonfuls along the edges first then work my way in. Also! The bag of peanut butter chips wasn't enough, so I added peanut butter to that mixture and a little more corn syrup too.",

I've made it many times and my best advice is to LIBERALLY spray the sides of your baking pan to prevent the marshmallow from becoming a permanent fixture. I also spray my knife before attempting to cut this dish. Also I've found I'm too cheap to buy the necessary 2 cups of peanut butter chips and just use a standard 12 oz. bag (which is about 1.5 cups. It works just fine. Enjoy!",
