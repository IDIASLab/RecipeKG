I also added various spices to the chops before I piled the crumb topping on--salt, pepper, cayenne, oregano, garlic powder and basil.  Just eyeballed the spices and added per my own taste.  I also baked them atop slices of onions which baked up crisp tender with a wonderful flavor from the juices/spices.  Finally, I started to put the chops under the broiler for a few minutes after they were done to crisp up the crumb mixture since it seemed a little 'wet' and I was SO glad I tasted it first!  Where this dish is lacking in presentation, it definitely makes up for in flavor.  This is an easy, quick and delicious weeknight meal with the perfect amount of horseradish and tender, succulent meat to boot.",
