Make sure you add some spices to it like cinnamon and nutmeg.  Loved these, And I don't feel as guilty!",

I also reduced the heat to 325 and the time to 15 minutes. It sounds like it was a lot more work but I found it absolutely delicious and the apples made it VERY juicy. I also greased the cookie sheet with Pam. My son (4) helped me make them and I had to put him on \"time-out\" for reaching onto the cookie sheet on the stove for another while I wasn't looking. I guess they're good!",

Bananas and dates make a great sweetener and if you add a bit of cinnamon, cloves, allspice (or whatever), they end up tasting like little banana bread bites.  Very good.

Sweetness relies on the ripeness of the bananas and sweetness of the dates (so they could be very sweet or only mildly so).  Cookies turn out soft.\r\n\r\nI loved them, and will definitely make them again.",
