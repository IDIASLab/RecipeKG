This recipe is like the ricotta you would use in lasagna, which is typically a blander grainier cheese. It can definitely be eaten like Chevre and used in recipes, but will not have that rich tang like traditional Chevre. To get Chevre, you need to use cultures and need to ripen the milk with them to get the flavor and texture you would expect from \"goat cheese.\"",

Save the whey in the freezer in quart zip locks to use a soup base or in place of chicken stock in risotto. Enjoy!",

We bought fresh goat's milk from a local farm to try this with and the end result was an easy-to-make cheese that had good texture but absolutely no flavor whatsoever. We are big lovers of the goat cheese that you buy at the store I'm not sure how they get that flavored the way it is but this was nothing like it. Still the recipe is definitely quick and simple maybe someday we'll try again and add spices or something.",

We had this with smoked salmon diced red onion and capers. It was really fantastic goat cheese. The goat milk that we used was purchased from Fred Meyer in the paper carton. I think that the flavor was extreemly mild due to the type of milk that we used for a stronger flavor I would use farm fresh goats milk. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!",
