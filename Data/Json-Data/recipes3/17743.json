                "reviewBody": "This was a great recipe but I did make a few changes I used regular flour and sugar and I lowered the amount of sea salt and I used white chocolate chips. but I think next time I may leave them out they just sunk to the bottom and didn't melt and we're stuck to the bottom. I found the batter to be too loose so I added 1/4 cup more of flour and I'll use a milder coffee next time the bustelo was a bit over powering. alsoI baked them for 18 min in a 375 oven maybe it's just my oven but they came out great light and fluffy though the bottom was a little crunchy because of the chips but overall they were great I had to keep slapping my husband hand because he was eating them before I could frost them lol. I also tweaked the frosting this is where I folded in the bacon and sprinkled sum on top. and I used 1 teaspoon of maple extract and two teaspoons of maple syrup and two splashes of vanilla extract because extracts tend to make things taste artificial in my opinion it takes away from the homemade taste. I was worried at first cause the batter had a molasses taste but when I tasted the finished cupcake it was almost like a coffee cupcake but the finished product was the perfect balanced bite I could taste every ingredient I will definitely be making these again I think I may have to because my husband might divorce me lol",

They're really sweet and moist though:) Oh and the icing left a lot to be desired. Just not my cup of tea really. The cream cheese was all I could taste by the end of the bite. Thanks for sharing!",

The only thing that stops me from giving it a five star rating is the bacon bits in the cupcake. I don't know if it's normal to have bacon inside the cake part of bacon cupcakes but I just found it a little strange and next time would just leave the bacon as garnish. This is just personal opinion though. If you like having bits of bacon inside your cake than this recipe is perfect for you!",
