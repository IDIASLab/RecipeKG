I used my homemade canned tomato sauce and tomatoes I preserved from my garden because I didn't have any fire roasted tomatoes on hand. I also added a chopped green pepper and some garlic because I like both of those in a meat sauce. I also cooked it with a couple of bay leaves. It was fabulous. However I suspect that the fire roasted tomatoes would have been equally as good. My family loved it.",
