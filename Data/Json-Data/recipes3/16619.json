Way too much barley recipe did not state whether to put the sauteed veggies into the casserole or not. I put them at the bottom of the casserole and the creamed cheese mixture on top. My husband rated this a 4 out of 10. He does not want any more. I have broken it into several pieces and placed in freezer bags. Will add to my homemade soups a bit at a time. The recipe ingredients looked so enticing. What a dissappointment. Used all the ingredients called for and followed the recipe. My adivce is not to bother.",
