I subbed lime juice for the lemon grass and I subbed homemade hot sauce for the chile. I didn't bother with the blender step and I used organic green beans that I had frozen over the summer and since I had blanched them then I skipped that step in the recipe and just put the frozen beans in the sauce after it had simmered down. The beans turned out a little more done than I would have liked but they were still really good. I'm sure it would be even better made with fresh beans but this is a nice and flexible recipe.",
