I used a red pepper, 1 stalk of celery, about 1/4 C. of frozen corn, a healthy dash of cayenne, 4 cloves of garlic and 1/2 tsp. of cumin. Once done, I stirred in the juice of 1/2 a fresh lime. Also, I salted the veggies while sauteing in the beginning, so I didn't use any more in the recipe. Garnished with sour cream, salsa, cilantro, and finely grated cheddar-jack cheese. We had corn muffins on the side to dip in the soup.  My husband, who is not a big bean eater loved it.  Thanks for the post!",

My adjustments include:  subbing 1 can of refried black beans for 1 can of black beans, thereby eliminating need for blender.  Used red bell pepper instead of green (YUM), garlic powder instead of garlic, 2 carrots instead of 1, omitted ham because none on hand, added juice of 1/2 a lime.  It was fabulous!  Garnished with fresh cilantro, sour cream, salsa, fried tortilla strips.  Will definitely make again.  This is a very mild version, could spice it up if preferred.  Quick and easy.",

I ran it all through the food processor, thinking that I wanted a little texture in the soup, but after trying it, I think I'd prefer it being smoother.  Next time I will use the blender and puree it.  It was kind of a weird color and looked a little strange while cooking, but it tasted fantastic!  It was even better for lunch the next day!  Highly recommend! ",
