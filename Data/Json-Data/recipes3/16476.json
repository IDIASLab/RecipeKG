Just make a roux with the butter and flour then add the milk and let thicken then add the onion and cheese and lastly the spinach. Then pour into a casserole. It just seemed more time consuming than it should have been and it turned out to be just like other creamed spinach recipes I've made before. The taste is good (whoa is there a lot of cheese!) though.",

I prepared it using only one pan on the top of the stove. I used the 1 tbls. of butter and sauted the onions until browned then I added the 3 tbls. additional butter to the same pan and after it melted I added the flour and blended until a smooth paste formed. After that I added cold milk the dry mustard and garlic salt. When the mixture thickened I added the cheddar cheese. I stirred the cheese and mixture until the cheese was melted and then added the spinach. Combined it all and then put in into the casserole dish and topped it with the Montery Jack cheese. Popped it in the oven and it came out perfect.",
