                "reviewBody": "Years ago Nestle used to promote its \"new\" product, pre-melted unsweetened chocolate, with an outrageously good brownie recipe along with an equally good fudge frosting.  I think what made that frosting so exceptional was that I remember it included an egg yolk. I had  measured out half an egg from the \"One Bowl Brownie\" recipe, and rather than discarding the other half egg, I used it to replace the egg white in this recipe.  Just as that Nestle recipe with the egg yolk, this was creamy, silky smooth, fudgey bliss.  So easy to mix up you don't even need an electric mixer - just beat the heck out of it with a wooden spoon until it's smooth and glossy. I added just a dribble of hot water, then poured it over my brownies (one recipe is perfect for an 8 or 9\" pan)  These brownies, frosted with this frosting, combined to make brownie PERFECTION.  I don't know if Nestle still promotes that memorable recipe anymore, but with this fudge frosting recipe it really doesn't matter.",

It develops a beautiful sheen and will do your cake, cookies, brownies or cupcakes proud. I didn't even use my mixer. Just beat it by hand for a minute or so. Be aware that it will thicken as it sets. I didn't have to add any water - the consistency was just perfect as is. No trouble with its being granular. Easy, too, with a minimum of ingredients. What more could you want? A surefire winner.",

This frosting has a thick but spreadable consistency and it tastes like chocolate.  You can't taste the powdered sugar.  It has a lovely gloss like ganache but was easier to prepare and apply.

(A double batch perfectly covered two 9-inch layer cakes). My problem with this frosting was the consistency. I followed the directions exactly and even added more water to thin it out at the end but it just wasn't very spreadable. It hardened rather quickly and near the end of my cake I actually had to apply it with my fingers because it wouldn't spread with my frosting spreader. (Thank goodness I was only serving it to my husband & kids!) I'm giving it three stars because the taste was phenomenal & it's quite possible that \"user error\" resulted in my problems even though I haven't had previous problems with frosting. I'd certainly be willing to give this recipe another try possibly keeping it warm longer and adding even more water (or perhaps milk) at the end to thin it out even more but I'd have to say that I much prefer the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe on this site. It has a similar flavor hardens beautifully and it doesn't use raw egg (if that bothers you at all).",
