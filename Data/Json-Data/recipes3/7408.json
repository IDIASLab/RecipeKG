You'll most likely find all the ingredients at your local supermarket except for the five spice powder, dried Chinese black mushrooms and rice vermicelli which can be found at your local Asian food mart. All the measurements here are pretty much to taste, some people like more pork, some less, some more soy sauce, some less, etc.",

It was easy to do not too long and very flavorful. There's a lot of veggie and meat compared to the noodles but I liked it that way. Do not omit the 5 spice powder: it really make the dish. If you don't have any you can make your own by grinding 2 star anise with 1/2 tsp whole fennel seeds and 1/2 tsp whole cloves then adding 1 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/4 tsp pepper. One last thing: it makes four generous servings but it's so good that you may find yourself eating more than you should! Thanks Tina I'll make it again.",
