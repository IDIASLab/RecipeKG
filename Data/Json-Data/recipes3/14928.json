Did make with chicken legs rather than wings because I had a whole package to use up:-)",

I did use four times the amounts listed only because I wanted to serve it over rice. I can't believe how much he loved it and he is not a big fan of spicy food. (I absolutely am) it was a fantastic dinner if you want to sweeten it just add more honey but was great just the way it was. Can't wait to make chicken wings with this sauce",
