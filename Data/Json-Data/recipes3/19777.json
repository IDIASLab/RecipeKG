They are absolutely delicious but I can't give it a full 5 stars because some of the ingredients in the ingredients list do not match up with the ingredients in the directions which made the recipe very unclear to me. First it says butter...well is it melted butter or softened or what? I used melted. Then it said to mix the butter with the spices but then it says to sprinkle the 'dry' spices over the potatoes so that's confusing. Then it says to grate the processed cheese so I assumed Velveets(R) but in the directions it says to pour on the processed cheese sauce...huh???? What I ended up doing was taking all the ingredients and doing what I thought was right which was mixing the melted butter (I used light) with the spices (only using 1/2 of the salt) and onions. I also 1/2'd the sour cream/milk mixture (I used light sour cream and fat free milk) and was glad I did as it would've been too much IMO and I used light Velveeta(R) that I shredded. The result was a fantastic potato dish that I will definately make again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

Use half the sour cream (unless you really LIKE sour cream because as the recipe is written that is the strongest flavor). If you cut the sour cream add a half cup milk more. I would also add a teaspoon of dill (preferably fresh but dried will do). And I would up the temperature to 400. Sounds like a lot of changes but it really isn't - it really was pretty easy to fix.",

I too melted the butter and it was much easier to dribble that on as a layer rather than trying to spread just softened butter. And I used velveeta. In addition to what she said we're instructed for the spice/butter layer to only mix half of it and then to put all of it (implied but huh?) on as a layer but instructed to just use all of the other ingredients and layer half of them (as it should be). And then it never instructs to actually mix the other half of the spice/butter ingredients. This is one of those cases where you better read through the entire directions first otherwise you'll find yourself wasting time mixing the other half of the spice/butter stuff. That's just silly and even an experienced cook might need to do a double-take of that. But in the end it was tasty. Next time I think I'd try the frozen hash browns. Grating potatoes wasn't my favorite activity and I might try a different cheese as well. I also might mix it all together as some have. (Another note some people might not get what 3/8 cup is. Call it 6 tbsp or 1/4 cup 2 tbsp.)",

Next time I make though I will have to change a few things. First when I mixed the seasoning with the butter it made it difficult to spread evenly. I would suggest sprinkling the seasoning on the potato layers and then spreading the butter. I had sections that were really salty and some that needed a lot of salt. I used gold potatoes I don't know if this is why but it got watery. I don't know how to fix that though. The taste was creamy and very rich.",
