Used a rice cooker but did not treat the coconut milk as liquid since it usually absorbs quickly without cooking the rice. Therefore I still added the usual amount of water. Also don't use curry powder tumeric has a much stronger flavor but I doubled the amount stated here. I skipped the bay leaves since I was out of them but wonder how they might have changed the flavor. The rice was fragrant and all flavors worked together wonderfully.",

The bay leaves were perfect too. My only other comment is I either just plain forgot the salt altogether or a \"pinch\" is not enough. Whichever I added a bit more to enhance the flavour. I love the coconut milk and rice combination. There was not a grain of rice left anywhere. I also used the 'low fat' version of coconut milk. Thank you MrsE - this will be a permanent addition to my recipe box. UPDATE TIPS- Do not use brown rice and do add extra salt. Don't forget to pound even the jarred lemongrass. Add water to the coconut milk to 2 cups liquid remember most rice needs a 2 to 1 ratio. Use a diffuser under your pan if your heat is still too high for a gentle simmer. One day I'll remember to take a picture!",

It cooked much quicker than the recipe suggested even at a very low heat and it was very dry because the moisture was gone before the rice was fully cooked. I had planned to take it to our church Christmas party but ended up throwing it out even after keeping it overnight thinking I might be able to doctor it up a little. I love lemongrass and coconot milk together as in Thai food so I might try this recipe again.",

I had problems cooking rice in coconut milk with another recipe I tried so I cooked the rice with water and 1/2 tsp of salt as I usually do along with the rest of the ingredients except the coconut milk. When the rice was done I added in the coconut milk. This probably made it have more of a creamy texture then the original recipe but it was delicious.",
