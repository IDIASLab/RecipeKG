I was able to puree my seed mixture all right for a smooth texture but my cream sauce ended up tasting an awful lot like chicken gravy. That could possibly be a result of using homemade broth rather than a can of store-bought (which is usually more bland) but it seemed like an awful lot of work to end up with chicken gravy topping my pumpkin ravioli! Definitely a major disappointment. Next time I'll make either a regular alfredo-type cream sauce or a tomato-based sauce for my pumpkin ravioli.

As one suggested I substituted pecans for the seeds (I can't imagine the seeds would have produced a good texture for a creamy sauce). I used milk instead of heavy cream (it was still plenty creamy this way). I used a slice of wheat bread instead of white and I omitted the peppers because we were out of them. I ended up adding about 3 Tbsp pumpkin puree and about 1 Tbsp tomato puree (I had extra from the ravioli recipe) to try and incorporate some of the flavors of the pasta and also to add flavor to the otherwise bland sauce. This also helped to thicken the sauce up a bit. With these adjustments the sauce was not bad. The texture is a little odd but not unpleasant. In the future I think we'll make the ravioli recipe but use a red sauce instead. It was worth the work to try the recipe once as-is though.",

This could be because I used prepackaged pumpkin seeds that probably were already salted. Not stated in recipe but should use seeds from a pumpkin to avoid this. 2.) Sauce was chewy. I tried to toast the seeds before I add the other ingredient then processed them but it still came out gritty not smooth. Not something I could serve.",
