Tweaked it just a bit by noting the following:  to keep your beans from staying too hard, don't add salt or tomato sauce until beans are soft;  I did the ole \"boil the beans for a minute, let sit for an hour\" thing with fine results; Used a mixture of navy, northern, and pinto beans; puree apx 1/3rd of soup to give it more consistency;  Outstanding flavor - my thanks for the recipe !!!",
