I cut the recipe in half and it still yielded 2-3 cups of dip. I added twice the amount of dill and 5 dashes of hot sauce (still a very cool refreshing dip- it just added more flavor). Do not use a blender or food processor or the constency will be too soupy. Chop and mix by hand and the dip will be perfect for veggies chips or spreading.

My 1st one was bitter so I had to throw out the entire batch and start over with a younger cuke with sweeter skin.
