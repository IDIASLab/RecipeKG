They did not have the correct pasta that the recipe called for so I subbed rigatoni. The dish was delicious but a little too dry. When you add the crumble on the top it soaks up a good deal of sauce so next time I would add extra.",

I couldn't get this into my mouth fast enough. The flavors come together so well and the crunchy panko and pistachios just really add so much and put this dish over the top. I did make my own alfredo sauce from scratch but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. This is definitely a keeper that will be making a regular appearance in our dinner rotation.",
