Full disclosure - I don't tend to actually *measure* ingredients on recipes like this, but I used the full ingredient list. (Except for the baby shallots - couldn't find them at my grocery store so I used pearl onions instead.) The only real change I made was to do this on the stove-top instead of the slow cooker since I didn't decide in time. I let the beef simmer in a little beef broth for an hour or so to get tender, then cooked most of the liquid off before adding the wine, tomatoes, herbs, and spices. I'm sure letting it stew all day in the slow cooker would have blended the flavors even better, but the stove-top version was very good.",
