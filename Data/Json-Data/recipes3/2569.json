I was a bit skeptical about using teriyaki in a burger mixture as I thought it might overpower the other flavors but it was actually a nice addition. I cut the recipe in half for one pound of burger meat and got three nice size patties. I used 1/2 tsp. of dried onion flakes vs. chopped onion (was a bit lazy) 1/4 tsp. of black pepper left out the salt and used 1 Tbsp. of low sodium teriyaki and 1 Tbsp. of low sodium soy sauce along with the rest of the ingredients. These held together on the grill perfectly and smelled great. They had a wonderful flavor! Perfect on toasted rolls with melted cheese grilled onion lettuce tomato and a dill pickle on the side!",

However, after forming patties, I put them in the freezer to firm up a bit since they were pretty moist and I thought that they might fall apart on the grill. The flavors melded together as any great recipe should. We had one burger left-over that I just ate for lunch (two days later) and it was even better today than the first day. I just placed it in the microwave for about 20 seconds, topped with a slice of swiss and some minced green onion and nuked it again for about 10 seconds. No bun necessary. I'm not kidding you - it tasted better than any burger I've ever had. This has become our new favorite burger with or without the bun!",
