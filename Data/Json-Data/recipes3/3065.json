I made it last night and it's very good!  What makes it even better is knowing how nutritious it is.  I'm glad I read about the need for 2 pie shells because mine yielded exactly that.  I used all the chard and no spinach.  I also purchased the healthier pie shells...no trans fat and all natural ingredients.  I added a little more parmesan and cheddar and didn't add capers and cardamom.  I also added some sliced red peppers and sauteeed them with the onions and added can of drained/rinsed mushrooms.  Next time, I will incorporate most of the cheddar into the mixture and sprinkle less on top.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and is good served with a salad.  Thank you, Melissa!",

I followed the recipe fairly closely but I'm willing to give three stars instead of two as the benefit of a doubt. The reviewer below who says the consistency is more like pumpkin pie is on the right track; for me it was more like vegetable dip though. The biggest issue for me was the seasoning; I HIGHLY suggest using no more than the amount of curry the recipe calls for if you're not specifically using MILD curry as I followed those suggestions and ended up with a quiche that smelled Indian. I would just as soon eat a normal egg-based quiche. Also you'll probably have to steam the spinach and chard separately because when uncooked they take up a MASSIVE amount of space.",
