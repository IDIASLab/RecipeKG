The only change to the recipe I made is that since I don\u2019t have the Xanthium gum I did substitute 1 tablespoon of psyllium husk. I am shocked at how incredibly moist the inside of the bread is, the crust has a gorgeous sheen and it slices like butter but doesn\u2019t fall apart. Best of all,  it doesn\u2019t taste like eggs at all which is what I was fearing the most. I will definitely be making this recipe over and over, I\u2019m so grateful for a keto recipes that taste good and I\u2019m pretty sure my kids will eat this.",

It tasted like straight up eggs with an almond flourish texture. When it came out of the oven it smelled like baked eggs like an eggy quiche or German pancakes. It does not toast well and adds a funky flavor to everything you eat it with. it is super heavy in calories too. if you are on a 2 600 calorie keto diet plan it may be fine but I am on a reduced plan of about 1700 and each slice is like 280 calories if you make 12 slices. so to make a sandwich it is a third of my daily calorie count before sandwich filling. All in all it has a good form and okayish texture and the recipe is good as far as directions and ingedients but I didn't like the taste or calorie density of this one.",
