I only used one cup of chicken broth and it came out without excess liquid which was perfect and just like when it's made on the stove. I don't ever add salt when I am cooking so when it goes to the table everyone can add their own level of saltiness. I'm happy to make it in the pressure cooker and get rid of the oil when it's made on the stove and then add butter when it's on my plate. Now I can just sprinkle with salt.",
