I will continue to make these. They were very easy and my family loved them. Thank you for the recipe.",

I also used minced fresh onion instead of dried and baked the croquettes at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes on each side. I sprayed them with a little olive oil before putting them in the oven and they turned out nice and crispy without all the extra grease. I will definitely make these again!",

The bread crumbs made all the difference. I usually have issues with my potato cakes falling apart when I made them in the past. I also made about a 2\" ball with the potatoes and rolled it in the bread crumbs and flattened them slightly. The size seemed to also make a difference. I added a bit of flour to the potatoes to make them stiffer and easier to work with. They were a huge hit with both ketchup and ranch dressing. Will make them everytime we have leftover mashed potatoes.",

I also substituted finely shredded chedder for the romano in half and parmeson in the other. The ones with chedder went over the best. I will definetly make these again. Next time I will try using fresh potatoes instead of instant. Edit 1/1/6. I've made these many more times since posting this review. My family loves them. Whenever we make mashed potatoes we make extra so we will have extra for croquettes. Since the first time we have always used real mashed potatoes and they turn out much better.",
