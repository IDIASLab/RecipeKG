The only thing we do differently is cook the chicken in all of the dressing at a low heat (275 degrees) for about 2 or 3 hours or until it browns.  It comes out tender and we then use the left over cooked dressing to \"dip\" the chicken.  This is our seven year old granddaughter's favorite, especially the dipping!",

The first time I made it I was a little disappointed with the taste...it was good, but not great. The second time I made it I used chicken cutlets instead of chicken breasts, doubled the cayenne pepper and added 1/4 - 1/2 tsp salt, 3 crushed garlic cloves, and a good sprinkling of parsley. I didn't have time to marinate it and I couldn't bbq with the snow, so I covered the chicken with 3/4 of the dressing and popped it in the oven uncovered at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes (turning half-way). I used the last 1/4 of the dressing to baste the chicken half way through cooking. It came out delicious!! I am not a huge chicken fan but this is some of the best chicken I have ever had. I can't wait to invite company over for dinner because I will definitely be making this recipe for them. It is going in my regular rotation!",

Creamy salad dressing usually refers to miracle whip and maybe that's what was intended but others took it to mean ranch dressing and that's what I used. It needed a lot of work so I added garlic powder rosemary hot pepper sauce worcestershire a few hot pepper flakes ground black pepper minced onion and let it all marinate for 5 hours. I reserved some marinade for dipping sauce and after that it wasn't bad. There are too many other recipes on this site that don't need this much \"doctoring\" to make them work.",
