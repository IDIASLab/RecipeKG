It all comes together quickly and easily and making a few adjustments didn t seem like such a big deal to me. I added some sliced celery had a little bit of Fideo and small seashell pasta so just combined the two in place of the noodles threw in a bay leaf and a few other spices and simmered for about half an hour. No it s not rich homemade vegetable soup but if you think of this as a starting point for a quick veggie soup and just use your personal taste I don't think you'll be disappointed. Enjoyed today for lunch and I d make this again.",
