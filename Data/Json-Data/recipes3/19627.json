Increase shredded potatoes to SIX CUPS and reduce your butter to 1/3 cup.  I didn't have paprika so I used 1 tsp of garlic spread mix and a dash of pepper...yum!  Cook for the 40 minutes then put it under low broil for 5 minutes to crisp the top (watch it so you don't overdo it).  Pull it out, add your chedder and back in the oven just till melted.  Take it out and let it \"rest\" for 5 minutes before eating. (This gives the butter a little time to absorb because you will see some in there when you pull it out.  My hubby and 3 girls devoured this and was so sad I didn't make a bigger batch!  I served it with pork chops and veggies.  Sooo good!",

For those that are complaining about it being greasy it is most likely because you are using Margarine instead of butter. My sister did this years ago we found IF you are going to use Margarine instead of Butter then only use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for (so about 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup). Just a note using margarine instead of butter does change the taste of this recipe.",
