The trick to not getting a bland dry cookie is the cookie to sugar coating ratio when you roll them in the powdered sugar. The cookie should be a small ball slightly larger than the size of a small marble cooked through but not browned so the flavor is mild. Then while they are a little warm still you coat them in the powdered sugar. After they are cool you coat them one more time. This creats a wonderful smooth coating that melts in your mouth right before the inside crunch from the cookie. Thanks Lana for the recipe!",
