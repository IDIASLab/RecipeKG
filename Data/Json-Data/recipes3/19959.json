I made mine with spinach herb tortillas and my husband used regular ones. Instead of making several small burritos we each made a large one and they were fantastic! We used organic fat free black beans and El Paso Garden Peppers salsa (although that gives the mixture a bit of a sweet taste). We also added low fat sour cream to the mixture to make it creamier and used plenty of cheese. The result was a wonderful mixture of flavors that we have officially deemed better than our favorite local hip burrito cafe that we're always raving about. Thanks for such a great time-saving and healthy recipe!",
