Be sure to season the zucchini with salt and pepper while cooking it and watch out with the oil. The onions sweat enough to create enough juice so you don't really need so much oil. To cut the fat reduce the oil in half and spray the pan with cooking spray before adding oil.",

I noticed a discrepancy in the recipe; it calls for 2 TBLS. of Parmesan Cheese twice in the recipe ingredients yet in the directions it says to add 1/2 cup of cheese. I guessed and went by the directions using the 1/2 cup of cheese and sprinkling 2 TBLS. of cheese over the top which worked out well. Besides that minor confusion the recipe was easy to make and I'll definitely be making it again.",

I hate when others change a recipe then rate it so I am rating it on the original which was good but I wanted to get more veggies into this one so I now add broccoli sun dried tomatoes mushrooms & kalamata olives and of course a bit more parmesan cheese. I only use 1/2 of a large onion more garlic and cut the zucchini larger as we like our veggies tender crisp. Thank you Dave for the recipe this is a regular in my home now.",
