The rice was not cool yet and I had to take my son to choir so it sat for 1 1/2 hrs before adding the rice and then serving. I did not like it that night. It was too oily and the red wine vinegar was too strong. I couldn't taste the black beans at all which I love. I put the remains in the fridge and had some for lunch the next day. It was sooo much better the next day. The oily taste was gone the vinegar and thyme had time to mellow. The fresh basil and parsley looked a little sad so I'll probably either put the fresh herbs in just before serving or use dried. And I would definitely add more beans (love black beans). Overall it was good and so simple (love the idea of a recipe that uses left over rice).",
