I used 2 whole eggs and 4 egg whites instead of 4 whole eggs and 4 egg whites.  I added 4 TBSP vinegar to the egg whites after beating.  When the vinegar and baking powder combine right before baking, it creates a chemical reaction \"rise\" similar to how bread normally rises.  The bread was moist and didn't crumble like another recipe I've tried in the past.  Thank you!",

I didn\u2019t have xantham powder so I substituted with Psyllium Husk Powder which is part of gluten free recipes. Texture and taste was similar to cornbread. It was a little salty for my taste but will use less salt next time. Will save this recipe for future use! Thank you :)",
