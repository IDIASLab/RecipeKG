I added chopped celery soy sauce and chopped ginger to the ground beef mixture (before cooking) to add moisture and a kick to the cooked patty. I did not use cheese. I topped off the burgers with chopped mushrooms sauteed in a soy sauce cornstarch and water mixture then I added the usual lettuce and tomatoe toppings. Also I used whole wheat buns instead. My husband absolutely loved these burgers! I have now cooked these burgers three nights in a row. These burgers are very flavorful and have a tasty kick!",

HA! I used more seasonings and a wasabi mayo. Very difficult to find a burger recipe that doesn't call for breadcrumbs so this really fit the bill. Kids and hubby were happy and I thank you!",
