I had to added some water to get it to blend in the blender, add just enough to get the blender to mix it. Otherwise it's too dry and the blenders blade just spins without actually mixing the ingredients. It's great on white rice, eggs, bread and especially rostarrie chicken (just like the restraunt serves! ) I live no where near one of there amazing restraunts,  so I have had to only dream of there green sauce.
