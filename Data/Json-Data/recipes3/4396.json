I used a very sharp cheddar and also some nice jarlsberg rather than a generic American cheese.\n\nInstead of \u2018salt\u2019 I used lowery\u2019s seasoned salt, 2 teaspoons. (and after mixing in the salt, I let it stand covered in fridge for a few hours before draining the extra liquid)\nI added 3 minced cloves of fresh garlic.\nTossed in some dry seasoning; cumin, basil, oregano, cilantro\u2026 and probably some other stuff.\n\nI pan fried them at med-high heat in olive oil until they had a light crispy crust (about 3 minutes per side)\n\nServed with sour cream and a dash of crystal hot sauce.",
