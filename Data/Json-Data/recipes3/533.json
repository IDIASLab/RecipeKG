I chose to tenderize the chicken breasts by poking them full of holes. They flattened out some too. I then marinated in the wine thyme and rosemary for a little over an hour (instead of seasoning over the grill). I topped them with swiss and aged provolone. Don't leave off the onions (make plenty)! The onions are very important to this chicken melt in my opinion. We also put Dijon mustard on the muffins and I can't imagine not having the Dijon flavor too. I think they would be a little bland without it. Served with a salad.",

Then put in rosemary and thyme (I had fresh) with big splash of red wine and simmered the whole thing for about 15 minutes 10 of which were covered.
