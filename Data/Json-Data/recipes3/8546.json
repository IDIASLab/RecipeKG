I thought it would have been better if they had been chopped, but he said then they wouldn't really taste like oysters.  The only change we would suggest is that you should add a little flour to the sauteed vegatable mixture (mirpoix) to make it into not quite a rue, this would help the fat blend better into the stew.  Cook the veggies down until they are almost transluscent, add about a teaspoon of flour and cook until the flour is no longer raw (a minute or two at most), then continue with the recipe as written.",
