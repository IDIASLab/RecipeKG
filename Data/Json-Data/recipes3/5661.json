Little do they (and my finicky husband) know they are also eating their archenemy, onions!! This dish is different because you boil the seasoning with the potatoes instead of adding them later, thus a milder flavor. Serve piping hot with butter or homemade gravy although they don't need either. Enjoy!!!",
