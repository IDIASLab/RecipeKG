Not only was I able to use the green beans but this recipe satisfied the carb portion of dinner as well. The only changes I made was to use fresh tomatoes and basil as I can't abide using dried or canned when fresh is at hand! Nice mix of flavors for a side dish that will complement a main course beautifully but won't steal the star of the show. Served with Chicken with Mushroom also from AR. Thank you tlriney for the submission.",

I didn't have any basil so I substituted Italian Seasonings and I had part of an orange pepper leftover so I chopped it and warmed it a bit in the microwave. Otherwise I followed the recipe. We thought it was very good. Next time I think I will use lemon olive oil double the Italian seasoning and use at least 1.5 teaspoons of salt. It just needed a little extra zing to be 5 stars! Thanks for posting. Update: It made great leftovers. It need more oil so I used the lemon - but any flavor would work. I served it hot and cold and add the extra seasoning. One day I add cooked chicken cubed into small pieces and mixed it all together. It was great and was a definite \"planned-over \" not a leftover.",
