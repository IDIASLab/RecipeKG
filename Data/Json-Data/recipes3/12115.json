I am glad I did it that way b/c the cheese was already beginning to brown and it was not in there that long. I made my own honey mustard dressing ('Honey Mustard Dressing II' from this site) and that worked out great. Great combo of flavors...a definite keeper YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

Going through the chicken with a sharp fork really helped in absorbing the honey mustard marinade;  I'm considering an overnight  marinade next time. Smart idea to use non-stick cooking spray on glass baking pan, and lay marinaded chicken by itself in 350 degree oven for 45 minutes THEN top each piece with generous amounts of bacon and Provolone for about  12 more minutes ( just as cheese browns ).  Your toughest food critic will love this dish--and you'll feel proud discovering how tasty you made this dish!!",
