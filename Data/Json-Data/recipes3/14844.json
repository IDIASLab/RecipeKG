With the extra's I have to admit this dish is going into \"my favorete's\" recipe book.  First, I didn't have any peanut oil or Thai chili's so I used 2 tbsp sesame oil and 3tbsp. of sweet chili sauce instead.  As for the garlic it sounded like a bit much so I just used 5 large cloves minced. The additions where 1/2 green pepper sliced, 1/2 red pepper sliced, 1/2 white onion sliced, 2 carrots peeled/ julienned, and 1/2 lime zest/juice which were added before the basil and allowed to cook coverd on med-low heat for about 5-10 mins. Since I did add these extra's I also upped the amount of soy sauce to 3 tsp. and the fish sauce to 3 tbsp.  Served with Jasmine rice and garnished with lime wedges and green onion.  Sooo good.  I think I will stay home for Thai more often.  ",

Per other reviews, I made the following changes:  in place of peanut oil, used sesame oil, used about 5 cloves of minced garilc, used lean ground turkey in place of the ground chicken, used 3T of sweet chili sauce in place of the Thai chiles, 3 teaspoons of lite soy sauce, 3T of fish sauce, used the juice of 1/2 a lime, sliced up 1/2 green bell pepper, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/2 onion, and julienned 2 baby carrots.  Next time I will add more basil since it does shrink up a lot, and if you like it spicy add some red pepper flakes to taste.  Excellent!",

This recipe came very close in flavor to the restaurant's.  I didn't have any Thai chiles on hand, so I used jalapenos.  Also added some ketsap manis, and some bok choy, just because we love it.  I really liked this dish but it was a bit too hot for my husband.  He didn't think he would like ground chicken and was surprised to find that he did.
