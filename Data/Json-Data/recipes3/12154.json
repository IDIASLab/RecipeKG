Hubby came into the kitchen, tasted it and proceeded to serve himself before I had a chance to bake it! So we ate it that way and it was delicious!",

However, the flavor is excellent, so don't be too quick to write this one off. I think it could be a big success with the following changes: First, reduce the amount of chicken stock to just 1 cup, which would be plenty. While it's simmering, sprinkle in a little more flour until the sauce thickens. While it's in the oven, remove the foil for the last 10 minutes or so. Finally, consider serving it over something. We had it over egg noodles, and that was really delicious.",

I used more flour than called for to thicken to consistency that felt more like a casserole to me, otherwise a little too watery. Topped with butter fried sage leaves instead of parsley--a complementary flavor and nice textural add. Served over rice with a side of rainbow carrots. If I didn't have leftover chicken, I don't know that I'd go to this recipe again. But, I'll certainly consider again if I find myself with purposeless chicken!",
