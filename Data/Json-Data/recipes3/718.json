I added the juice from 1/2 a lemon to the batter and mixed it in my Kitchenaid mixer and I had no problems getting everything to blend. I also ran the beater between batches to keep it well blended. I added a package of Lemonade flavored koolaid to the powdered sugar. It gave the cookies a bit of tartness that reminded me of the Lemon Coolers that I believe Sunshine used to make. Next time I may cook them longer than recommended at a lower heat so they will get crunchy without browning and I'll dip them back into the powdered sugar/lemonade mixture after baking.",

I baked mine for 10 minutes kept them in for 12 still didn't look done so I added an additional 3 minutes. Yes they were soft chewy cookies but I found them to be gooey and overly sweet. My second batch I kept in until they were nearly a golden brown. They were better because they were crisp on the outside soft on the inside. But it wasn't good enough for me to finish baking the rest of dough. Update: I stored them in a ziploc bag and the next day the texture was better and the taste mellowed. IF I ever made these again I'd bake them a day ahead.",

I tried it the way it was written the first time then changed a few things and tried again and they turned out wonderful. They were very pretty cookies that got a lot of attention at a bake sale. I wanted them a little tart so I added 1 T. of Real Lemon to the batter. I also measured 2 cups of Cool Whip for the recipe and put the batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour before measuring out a scant 1 t. of dough for each cookie. I baked them for 12 min. and they were perfect when they cooled. My great-nephew asked me to please make some more! Thanks for the recipe.",
