One suggestion-make sure that when you're cooking the cabbage to wait untill at least some of it is brown or nearly black to take it off the heat because this is when the cabbage has the most flavor. Also try to use a cast iron skillet if you have one that's how it's traditionally made.",

Try, instead of cooking raw bacon, starting with the butter and either cooked bacon pieces (but still soft) or packaged bacon bits (the kind that is real bacon and still chewy).  This provides enough grease for the flavor, without all of the calories.  If you end up short on liquid, just add olive oil.",

I Used about 1/2 cup of celery and one yellow not green bell pepper. This should be glistening - if that seems greasy to you then don't book with bacon grease! This is down-home cooking for sure. The best thing to do is fryt he bacon up whole then save it to crumble over the cabbage at the end of cooking. This recipe needs a lot of salt crushed red pepper and maybe a dash of vinegar to make it sing.",
