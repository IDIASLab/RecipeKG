This recipe is such a surprise you will be blown away by the flavor.. Love love love this recipe!**Update we made this recipe again for the thousand time, this time we seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper omitted the honey mustard and used just a small amount of ranch dressing in it's place. Everything else we kept the same and it turned out AMAZING! It tastes like our favorite pizza from straw hat pizza the lemon pepper chicken pizza this is how we will be making this recipe from now on it's so delicious",

(Our family doesn't like chunks of onion.  Putting the onion in a food processor gives the flavor without the texture.)  That was our only change.  The honey Dijon mustard gives it just the right amount of sweet kick...and my kids don't like mustard.  They gobbled it up.",

I added 2/3 cup of milk to the egg mixture to make a little more custard. It covers the dish a little better and I used muenster cheese instead of mozzarella for the top. If you have dental work like I do mozzarella is hard to handle. It strings and sticks to the place of choking you. I found a long time ago that muenster cheese has pretty much the same taste without the sticking qualities. Neither the milk nor the change in cheese detracted from the taste. A very good recipe and good with salsa served along side. Thanks for sharing.",

I steamed the zuccini and then added the chicken and zuccuni to the onion mix. I only used 1 can of biscuits because that was all i had and just smooshed them into a 9x13 pan and then drizzled honey mustard on top of them. topped with the chicken mix and then when i did the egg mix with the seasonings i only used 2 eggs (because thats all i had). i also topped it with cheddar cheese instead! i also topped it with a sprinkle of salt! very tasty!!!",
