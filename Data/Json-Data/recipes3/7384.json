FYI...to speed up the process with no change to the taste or texture, use the MICROWAVE!!! a nice medium (typical) sized squash takes about 10 mins on high in a shallow baking dish with a small amount of water and salt to create steam. follow same steps as in this recipe just use your microwave. Also, be adventurous, this squash is fabulous with butter and dried italian herbs, or drizzled with rosemary infused olive oil (a cinch to make) if it sounds good on pasta it will be great with this squash!",

I let it cool and followed the rest of the directions. I cut back on the garlic using only one clove and used about 1/4 cup of chopped onion. All it needed was a bit of salt, pepper, and some parsley for color. Simple and delicious!",

I have always struggled with a piping hot squash as I awkwardly tried to shred it without burning the heck out of my hands! Other than substituting shallots for the onion I prepared this as directed using butter. Garnished with fresh minced parsley this was simple pretty and delicious.",
