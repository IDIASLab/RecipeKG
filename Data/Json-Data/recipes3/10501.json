It is made from items that are almost always found in a West Indian/Carribean kitchen. Sardines can be substituted with any canned salt fish, but the soybean oil gives it the texture that is out of this world! Very tasty if you love spicy and if you love sardines!",

Instead of using sardines in soybean oil i used sardines in water & instead of Scotch bonnet peppers i used scotch bonnett pepper sauce because it's what I had on hand and i could control the level of spice and heat. The 2nd time i made it i added Green peppers and used grits instead of rice.  Still a wonderful flavor and very satisfying dish. The coconut oil really gives it the island flare.",
