Used mushrooms, red & green bell peppers and chopped onion, and didn't have turmeric so I used mustard powder (figured it might add a bit of yellow to make it look more like eggs), onion and garlic powders and a pinch of curry powder.  Topped with fresh herbs and wrapped in a tortilla.  Next time I think I will season and start cooking the tofu first, then add veggies because it took about 10 minutes to cook off the liquid and by then the peppers were cooked too much for my taste.  So next time I'll saute the tofu for 5 minutes or so before adding the veggies.",

My son is a football player and Tofu is an excellent source of protein. The trick with cooking with Tofu is to make sure you press it. Take a kitchen towel and fold it around the tofu. I used firm tofu for this recipe. Press as much of the water out by using you hands. Change towel and press again then put a heavy pot on top of it for about 5 minutes.  Lay the pressed tofu on paper towels to \"air dry\" for about 15 minutes. Then it's ready to use.\n\nI used 1/2 of a large red bell pepper, 1/2 scallion, 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 c. Shitake Mushrooms, 1/2 c. of Baby Bellas a can of Original Style Rotell (drained), and used spiced Himalayan Salt, Hot Madras Curry Powder and the Turmeric. I chopped all veggies into little diced pieces and sauteed them in garlic and olive oil for about 3 minutes and then added the crumbled tofu. Once the tofu was cooked well, I added the drained rotell and spices. Cooked until heated through....\n\nThis was a BIG hit and will become a staple brunch/snack in our home. I will have to double, or maybe triple the recipe next time because everyone wanted seconds, but there was only enough for three servings.",
