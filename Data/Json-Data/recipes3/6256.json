You should start w/ 3-4 potatoes (peeled or not, your preference), 1 bell pepper, chopped in large chunks, 1 lb sausage, sliced, 2-3 T butter.  Melt butter in deep skillet, add potatoes and pepper, season to taste.  After they have begun to cook, add sausage and cook for about 30 min.  Wow  delish!  Almost exacty like your recipe, but fresh potatoes.  And she's right....it's great!",

I served it wrapped in small flour tortillas for my kids and added shredded cheese sour cream and salsa for the ones that wanted theirs deluxe. A super quick addition for those nights you really don't want to go all out and cook a hugh meal these are filling. I'm make them again.",
