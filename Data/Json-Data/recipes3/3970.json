I usually grill like so: First bring them to a boil in a pot of water turn down to a simmer and let cook for about 45 minutes on low. Take them out cool and slice into 1/2 inch slices. Heat a BBQ grill to high heat place slices on the grill and cook as you baste with BBQ sauce. We like them when they get crispy and a bit burnt and then wrap them in tortillas w/more BBQ sauce.

I season mine with salt & pepper before battering to bring out the flavor of the meat better. Roll in flour dip in milk (or buttermilk for a thicker batter) then again in flour. I like to fry mine in a deep fryer for more even cooking. The secret with any frying is to make sure that your grease is hot enough to start frying immediately upon placing the item to be cooked in it so that you don't wind up with soggy greasy food. Again....I LOVE sweetbreads!! One of my comfort foods!",
