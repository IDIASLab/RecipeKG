Great recipe!!! The only change I might make would be to use a light Italian dressing or something along those lines as the balsamic made the lettuce darker than I would have liked it to look. I made mine in a clear bowl as my platters were already in use. Next time I will be sure to put it on the platter as I think it would look nicer.",
