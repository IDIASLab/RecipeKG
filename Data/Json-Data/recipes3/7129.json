I used chilli peppers in place of jalapenos because the kids can tolerate it a lot better.  We turned into tacos as well, with my husbands homemade salsa with tomatoes, jalapenos, cilantro, onions, lemon juice and garlic powder.  I even chased the kids with the tongue before cooking, and they still liked eating it!!",

I was about to get FRESH beef tongue which I think made the dish good. Instead of cooking the tomatoes, jalapenos separte I cooked it with the tongue and I added 1 cup of chicken broth. He said it was just like the kind he would get in his favorite restuarant in Texas. I have friends here now wanting the recipe. This is a keeper. :)",

Serve with mexican rice and pinto beans. and of course flour or corn tortillas. You can also add 1 hot serrano chopped into tomato and onion mixture. thanks again for a great recipe",
