Her mother cooked zucchini alot for part of the meal. She would slice the zucchini approx 1/4 inch thick dip in beaten egg then drop into seasoned flour. Which was just salt & pepper added to the flour. She would then fry them in a pan with oil until golden brown. Then remove to a paper towel to drain. I have always fried my zucchini the same way and it is awesome. I use canola oil for frying as we also watch our fats. Even my kids love friend zucchini this way.",

I don't use margarine, my choice is butter instead of hydrogenated fat, but butter scorched if you got it hot enough to make the coating crispy and at lower temperatures it just soaks up fat and stays soggy. Oil would have definitely been a much better choice. Maybe if you use margarine this will turn out, but I can't see the benefit, I'll go back to using seasoned bread crumbs and olive oil for my fried zucchini.",
