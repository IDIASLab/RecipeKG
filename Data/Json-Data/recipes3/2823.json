Please do not thicken with cornstarch! If you start the sauce well in advance and are patient, you will end up with something that is truly magnificent. By allowing enough time for this to reduce and thicken on its own it will become concentrated, producing a luxurious, rich, velvety and very flavorful sauce. Once the stock and wine have been reduced, add the cream and continue boiling. Also, rather than baking the chicken as directed, I cooked it in a skillet for more flavor and color (having started the sauce well in advance of the chicken). I dredged the chicken in flour, salt and pepper, then quickly browned it in olive oil. Added the mushrooms to the chicken, and then the  artichokes (I used frozen) during the last few minutes.  Meantime, the lovely cream sauce is boiling away and thickening in a separate saucepan! Once the sauce is thickened, add it to the pan with the chicken. This is a spectacular dish with an absolutely outstanding sauce! ",

A few changes...I cooked the chicken in a pan with olive oil and seasoned the chicken with salt pepper onion and garlic powder. I first sauted the onion and garlic in olive oil and then put in chicken broth and let it reduce which took a while. The chicken breasts I used were pretty thick so the sauce had plenty of time to reduce. I also used milk instead of cream. What I did was in a separate sauce pan use 1 cup 2% milk and 1/4 cup butter then get it to a boil to melt the butter. Then I put it in a small food processor to emulsify it. Tasted good and I didn't have to go buy cream.",

I used those idividually frozen chicken breasts for simplicity and since they had to bake a bit longer I had plenty of time to let the chicken stock reduce. Take the time to reduce folks.... that's what gives your kitchen/house time to start smelling so great! I read one review about it being 'too salty ' but since this recipe only calls for 'salt to taste ' how can you blame the recipe? Next time I will use half-and-half instead of heavy cream. I used one small boiler onion (because I don't like having stinky half-onions hanging around my house) and when I added the cream I added one chopped fresh tomato for color. A little fresh spinach might be yummy too. Yum Yum Yum!",
