First, make duxelles for the stuffing (sauteed finely chopped mushrooms with shallots) and then add about a couple of tablespoons of white wine and let that get absorbed. No breadcrumbs. Either slice the chicken in half horizontally or pound it flat or both before you stuff it. Roll the chicken up then brush it with olive oil or butter then roll it in the breadcrumbs mixed with grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp. paprika and 1/2 tsp. thyme. Then pour the cream and bake! Yum!",

I minced the mushrooms and onions and added some chopped garlic--cooked this in the 1/4 c. butter till dark several minutes then deglazed the pan with a splash of wine until it was absorbed and the mixture resembled a paste (added NO bread crumbs). I actually forgot about the nutmeg but we didn't miss it. I pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/4\" thickness then rolled them up with the mushroom mixture. I coated the chicken with melted butter then in a mixture of plain bread crumbs mixed with a couple tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Poured the cream over and then baked at 375 degrees rather than 350. I served this with green beans and \"Sun-Dried Tomato Basil Orzo \" also from this site. Hubby specifically REQUESTED that we have the leftovers again for dinner tomorrow night! Thanks to both Jennifer and MICHELLECA for this fabulous dish. My suggestion?....please don't ruin this wonderful recipe with canned cream of mushroom soup. Make it as the recipe directs by just pouring the cream over all. It might sound unusual but believe me it turns into something truly wonderful and you won't be disappointed!",

I ended up cooking the mushrooms in butter and white wine along with minced garlic and onion. I butterflied and stuffed the chicken breasts. And then....I put a little butter in the pan used for the mushrooms and added some cream of mushroom soup cream and wine. I whisked these together and topped the chicken with the cream mixture. When the chicken was cooked I poured off the cream/cream of mushroom mixture back into the sauce pan....and added a little more ingredient to thicken it into a gravy type sauce. It was AWESOME! I will definitely make this again...and play around with the ingredients. It just seemed too bland topped merely with cream.",
