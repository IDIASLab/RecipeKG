We had never tried buffalo before and we were pleasantly surprised how much we liked it! Flank steak can be tough and chewy and I was hesitant to make this without a marinade to tenderize it but I am glad I didn't. It was tender and had wonderful flavor. I used lemon pepper instead of regular pepper but prepared everything else according to the recipe. If you haven't tried buffalo - give it a try!",
