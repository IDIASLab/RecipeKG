I don't care for onion s crunchy texture so I used onion powder instead and Dijon mustard. I baked mine for almost 15 minutes and it was warm but not hot by any means. I could have given it a few more minutes easily. I only made 1 sandwich and baked it in the toaster oven. I'd fix this again it was a nice change from a cold ham sandwich. Thanks Pasofanatic.",
