Made these and others from Allrecipes: the feta-bacon green beans (not so good) and the roasted brussel sprouts (awesome) The only change I made was to use fresh green beans about 1 lb which I partially cooked in the microwave for about 5 mins first w/a bit of water then I drained and proceeded w/the recipe just sort of stir frying them w/the oil garlic and adding the cilantro at the end after the beans had gotten nice and dark. Not a pretty recipe but so delicious. Never would have thought of cilantro and green beans together but was absolutely delicious --I couldn't get enough of them and they were excellent reheated the next day in the microwave! Will DEFINITELY add these to my veg. side dish favorites. Such simple ingredients and preparation but a wonderfully complex flavor!",

I also like to turn the heat up a little the last few minutes and brown the beans slightly.  Make sure to keep stirring if you turn the heat up.",
