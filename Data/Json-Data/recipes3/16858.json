Thousands of bubbles, trapped in the cooling sugar syrup, give this the most interesting melt-in-your-mouth texture. As long as you're very careful and heat the syrup up to the correct temp, there's not a lot that can go wrong.",

Especially during Covid, when I get a craving for something sweet, this is my go-to so I don't ever have to run out to the store. I live at a high altitude, and for me, I don't use a thermometer as it usually burns long before it gets to temperature, so I just go by colour. When it gets to be a nice orangy amber, that's when I add the soda. Works like a charm. Personally, I add just tidge of vanilla (about 1/8 tsp) just for the added flavour, but it's not really necessary.",

I ran out of honey while mixing up an earlier recipe so I was forced to add 2 tbsp extra of corn syrup to substitute but I have since bought honey and fully intend to use it when I make the next batch for gifts. I used 1 tsp of baking soda but I am thinking of splitting the difference on the next batch. which will also be coated in chocolate. I also think I got it a second overdone but that is the exact reason I wanted to make a test batch. Candy is tricky and I wanted to have a little experience before I made things to give away to family. Great recipe and very easy. I don't usually watch the videos but I absolutely did for this just to make sure I got it right. I love Crunchie bars and was excited to try to make something similar at home with few ingredients.",

I used golden syrup (as per recipe suggestion) and farmer's market honey the kinda stuff that comes in a twist-top Ball jar you get when going apple picking.
