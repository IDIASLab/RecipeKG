Depending on how small you cube the pumpkin will determine how long it takes before it's cooked through. Mine didn't take more than a couple of minutes of boiling in the coconut milk before it was done to my liking. I had diced my pumpkin in about 1/2\" dice. I served this over Jasmine rice, and it made for a delicious lunch!",
