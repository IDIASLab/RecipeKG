I have made this 3 times in the past month...great addition to any meal. I even ate a piece for breakfast!!",

I'm giving it 5 stars because it meets my three requirements of a great recipe--easy to prepare few ingredients and delicious. I used only about half of the oil and use more squash than it called for so also added one extra egg. I baked mine in a 8x8 glass baking dish so had to cook it for closer to an hour. I often find quiche recipes to be too eggy--too heavy and rich. But the Bisquick in this recipe made it light and fluffy and not too rich at all. Now that I know this trick there are all sorts of variations that I can't wait to try! Thanks for the great idea!!",
