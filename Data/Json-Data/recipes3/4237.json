I cooked 2 chicken breasts as instructed and when I went to make the sauce, I added 2 cloves of garlic which worked really well with the lime.  I also added the zest of about half the lime.  It's important to note that while I only used 2 chicken breasts, I made the full amount of sauce, and it was perfect.  As suggested by other reviewers, I did not use a 1/2 cup of butter but rather about 3-4 tbsp.  The lime zest was not necessary as DH and I found that the lime flavour was just too intense and the lime juice is quite enough.  A good recipe, but I would definitely add the garlic!",

I cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces use half a stick of butter use about a tablespoon of fresh dill and some chopped fresh chives or scallions and I add just a little flour to thicken the sauce. This goes great with Uncle Ben's original wild rice and corn. I love this because it is so easy to make that I can prep and cook while still keeping an eye on the kids!",

With this recipe's simple directions the chicken came out tender and juicy. After cooking I put the chicken on a plate and put it in the microwave to keep warm. I used the juice of 1 small-ish lemon and about 3-4 pats of butter for 3 chicken breasts. I loved the tartness but I'm not partial to dill so I may substitue with something else (someone's suggestion of cilantro sounds delicious!)",
