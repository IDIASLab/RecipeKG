So delicious that I had it for leftovers the next day, and I do not like leftovers.\n\nMy adjustments:\n1. Salted the zucchini and placed it in a colander at the very beginning, and also carefully drained excess liquid from the dish right after removing it from the oven.\n2. Ingredients adjustment: 3 med zucchini, 1/2 lb lean ground turkey, 1/2 med onion, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/4 cup pre-packaged shredded carrots, 1/2 jar spaghetti sauce, 2/3 cup low-fat ricotta (in place of cottage cheese), 1 egg white.

In response to other reviews commenting on the dish being too watery, I took all possible precautions.  I drained the tomato sauce, drained the cottage cheese, and \"sweated\" the zucchini. Here's how:  Place cut slices in colander and sprinkle VERY generously with salt.  Let sit for 30-45 minutes, while chopping veggies, grating cheese, and cooking tomato mixture.  Rinse zucchini thoroughly and absorb any water with paper towel.  After all this, I only had about 1/4 cup liquid in the entire dish.  I simply tilted the dish and let it drain out.  Everything stayed together wonderfully and tasted fantastic!",

Also used more veggies including some chopped mushrooms lots of fresh garlic and celery. Also used some red pepper flake and a lot of fresh basil at the end. I let this garden sauce simmer until it was fairly thick and our casserole was not watery at all. Put the parmesan right in with the non-fat cottage cheese as well as some garlic powder.

MY only issue was it came out VERY VERY watery and also the Zucc's were not tender. Next time I will try to slice them thinner (which should be fun - lol) and also maybe press them a bit in the attempt to get some of the water out. Besides those two issues though it was flavorful and I am going to try to make it again.",
