Serve over brown rice cooked in chicken broth and butter that is reminiscent of risotto. I have made the rice with water and bouillon instead of broth, with very little change in the flavor or texture. Like so many dishes, this one is better the next day. I adapted this recipe from the chipotle shrimp recipe on this site.",

So I cut way back and only used 2 chipotles in adobo (maybe 1/4 of the 7 oz can) 10 or 12 jalapeno slices from a jar instead of 2 whole fresh ones 1 clove of garlic instead of 2 and no salt (high blood pressure ya know). I also added a stalk of celery sliced along with the onions just because. Well it turned out very spicy even with the huge reduction in spices. We did enjoy it but any spicier and it would not have been edible for us. As is it would have been a 1-star recipe but the changes made it palatable and it was easy to make so I gave it 3. Also I recommend serving recipes like this on a bed of lettuce and/or adding sour cream to cool them off if they come out too spicy for you.",

I must say reason why I gave it a 4 star is because it was too too spicy for the next time I make this (because I will be making it again) I will not add the jalape\u00f1o peppers I think with the adobe chipolte chiles is more than enough heat for this dish. if you do enjoy a very spicy heat out your ears dish then add them but if not you can exclude them.",
