This was a nice change and I really enjoyed these little critters. For added flavor I did season the flour with garlic and onion powders and a bit of cayenne. If you've never eaten one, give this a shot and please note that any good fish market will happily clean the crabs for you. Thanks WesBryant and happy eating!",

We live just a couple of miles from Puget Sound and have eaten more than our share of fresh Dungeness... but fresh soft shelled crab is not something that we can seem to find out here.  BUT, I found some frozen ones and decided to take a chance!  Well, I'm glad I did because they are AWESOME!  I thawed them slowly in the fridge and then unwrapped them (they were IQF, luckily!) and put them on a clean, dry kitchen towel, folded over on top of them so that they were covered top and bottom, for an hour to soak up some of the moisture (they were VERY wet when thawed).  I then put them in the fridge, towel and all, until dinner time a couple of hours later.  I used the egg-milk blend and put a little Old Bay into the flour.  I fried them in fresh canola oil.  I made two each for DH and me... (with homemade tartar sauce) as well as a small piece of strip (NY) steak and some french fries.  A truly delicious meal!  It's been a couple of days and DH is still commenting on how juicy and crispy those crab were!  Thanks for the recipe, Wes!",
