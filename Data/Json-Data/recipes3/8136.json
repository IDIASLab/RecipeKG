After taking it off the grill let it sit for about 10 minutes to give it time to take on its unique texture. I used \"Low Fat Buttermilk Ranch Dressing\" by JPSMOMMIE from this site. My husband does not like blue cheese so I did not use it but did add some crushed walnuts. Makes a nice presentation too!",
