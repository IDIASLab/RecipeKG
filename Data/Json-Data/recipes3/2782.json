We use Hungarian peppers which have a mild flesh but HOT seeds and fiber. {  I recommend these peppers because bell peppers often have a bitter aftertaste} Scraping out the seeds and most fiber gives the dish some tang.  Also, Hungarians use lean pork, not beef, and rice is at least parboiled before being mixed with meat and seasonings.  Minced garlic, salt and pepper, minced parley are also part of the stuffing. Sauce base is tomato juice, as stated, but it is thickened with a roux and sugar is added to reduce acidity - a mild marinara would probably taste good too, but then the flavor would not be authentically Hungarian.",

Delicious, despite the following changes because of time/materials on hand:\na) Used ground chicken\nb) sauteed the onions in a little olive oil, added paprika, then browned the chicken and added more paprika.   Mixed into cooked brown rice and stuffed the peppers.\nc) Baked in oven on 375 for 60 minutes, but used tomato sauce instead of juice.  \nd) Used low fat sour cream, added 30 minutes before end.\nSo rich and delicious - the ultimate comfort food, without being too decadent.  I would definitely make this again - and will try the original recipe  too when I have the time/ingredients available, but I think I'd keep the paprika, as it adds such a great flavor.\nThanks!",

The rice should be fully cooked, not just brought to a rolling boil as it may still be a little crunchy even after cooking with the meat mixture in the better. In addition to the salt and pepper, I added paprika. Onions should be finely diced to avoid overly big pieces that may still be crunchy. I used diluted tomato soup instead of tomato juice to try and achieve a sauce with more body. It was still lacking in that and flavour. I may use a regular tomato sauce watered down slightly next time instead. We used green peppers instead of yellow. I baked it in the oven at 350F for 45 minutes; an hour may have been a little better and perhaps a little more rice and definitely more seasonings. But still quite good.",
