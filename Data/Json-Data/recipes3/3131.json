The nice thing about this recipe is you can really fudge on the amounts of any of the ingredients. If you dont have enough of something dont worry about it. My only tip (that I learned the hard way) is to select ripe to over-ripe avocados. If you get a bright green (fresh) avocado it is not soft enough to blend. Save those for your salads and other recipes that call for sliced avocados. You can squeeze the avocados in the grocery store the softer the better. They're usually a little black on the outside too.",

Guacamole isn't guacamole unless it's made with cream cheese. This would complement any taco chalupa or carne asada fajita!!",
