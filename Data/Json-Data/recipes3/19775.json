The second time, I got a little more creative and we ended up liking it even more. In addition to the ingredients written, I added 3 Tbls. of vinegar and 1 Tbls. of dijon mustard, which I blended in my food processor. After marinating the chicken, I broiled each chicken piece ten minutes on each side. I then placed the meat in the oven and continued to baste with the sauce. The broiling gave the chicken a nice crispy top and the vinegar and mustard additions added a nice flavor. Great recipe Holly!",
