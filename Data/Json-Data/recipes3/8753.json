I used rather big potatoes and ended up eyeballing the ingredients to make them sufficient for the amount of wedges I have. That is perhaps why this recipe is great - use the seasonings according to your tastes and when it comes to curry powder, there is no such thing as too much for me and my husband. Thank you for such and enjoyable side dish. We rarely eat regular potatoes and this made it so much more satisfying!",
