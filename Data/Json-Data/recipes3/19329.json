I had to make some changes based on ingredients on hand and w/that it was one of the best dishes I have ever prepared. I only hope I can remember what I did for next time. It takes longer than 20 minutes to roast garlic to make it golden brown. I have a garlic roaster and it took double time. Only had legs so threw those in oven w/the white wine and s/p Old Bay. Covered and baked while the garlic was roasting. Doubled the amt. of cheese and shredded both parm. and romano. Sauteed onions in 1 tbsp. butter 1tbsp. olive oil and added a couple of chopped romas tsp fine herbs and in lieu of 1 cup milk used the wine from the chicken w/milk to make 1 cup. Wine I used was sweet so it made the sauce too sweet so squeezed half a lemon and about 1/2 cup sour cream. Made a flour slurry using some of the hot wine liquid and added to mixture to thicken. The house smells wonderful and I wish it were not so fattening because I could eat the whole thing. Serving over linguine.",

I changed up the sauce quite a bit. I suspected that it would be bland even with the garlic so I sauteed 2 shallots and some crimini mushrooms in butter and set it aside just in case. When I made the sauce I added the flour before the milk in order to make a roux so the flour wouldn't be chunky. Then I used 1/2 cup half-and-half and 1/2 cup nonfat milk. I also used the whole head of garlic. The sauce was still incredibly bland. I added more parmesan threw in some pecorino romano cheese the shallot/mushroom mixture and some salt and pepper. I also added a little bit of the wine from the cooked chicken. It came out pretty good. I'd make it again but probably only once every few months.",

So I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces and marinated in white cooking wine and a little soy sauce along with some salt and pepper. After about 20 minutes I added a few tablespoons of flour to the chicken pieces and mixed it up. I then sauteed the chicken pieces on a high heat until cooked. Next I sauteed some green onions and matsutake mushrooms in a separate pan with a tbsp. of olive oil and a tbsp. of butter then added the tbsp. of flour a dash or two of salt 1/2 cup of skim milk a 1/2 cup of half and half and the roasted garlic cloves. Before the sauce came to a boil it was thickened just right - be sure to make the sauce on a really low heat so that it does not come to a boil otherwise it will turn out too thick. Lastly I spooned the sauce mixture over the chicken and it was ready to eat. In the end I think it turned out pretty good a little time consuming so not something I'll make on a weeknight.",

It started off as big thick lumps and though I stirred and stirred it made the sauce grainy. I should have followed my instincts and made a roux then added the milk bit by bit. The end result was ok but nothing outstanding - I added more cheese because it was rather bland - and certainly not worth the unexpected effort. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway.

I was afraid that the alcohol would dry the chicken out by itself so I just whisked some onion powder oregano italian seasoning parsley and some lemon juice into olice oil and generously brushed the chicken breasts before putting them in the oven. I turned them over once during cooktime and broiled for about 22 minutes. I made the sauce by first making a roux... I know that the recipe called for something different but I hate the taste of uncooked flour in a sauce. Once the flour was a little browned I slowly added the milk whisking constantly. I threw in double the cheese and I used shredded rather than grated. Once the cheese was melted I added the garlic. I roasted two small heads of garlic... it was perfect! When well combined I added a touch of salt some fresh parsley and a TON of black pepper (I love lots of cracked black pepper in a white sauce!!). I served it over some whole grain mix (brown rice bulgur and cracked red wheat) and it really was a DELICIOUS meal! My house smelled amazing and I could have just eaten the sauce! Thank you so much for this recipe!",

I had to make changes based on what I had and because we are a gluten free family. I can't wait to make this again and neither can my husband! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!! Changes: 2 heads of garlic & roasted it for 40 minutes 1/4 cup of Parm cheese and 1/4 cup Asiago cheese (we love our cheese too) rice flour & stirred in some sauteed peppers and onions.",
