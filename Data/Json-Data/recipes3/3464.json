No slipping around as you cut, and the kernels fall right into the pan!!... and you feel ever so clever.",

Or you can use Good Seasons Italian dressing packets, prepared the way you like it, instead of the oil, vinegar, and salt called for in the recipe. Canned corn works fine instead of fresh -- you lose a bit of flavor, but it's easier and faster. I use cherry tomatoes sliced in half instead of dicing large tomatoes -- it's easier, looks nicer, and usually tastes better, too. I prefer to use either a chopped red onion or sliced green onions instead of a white onion. Fresh basil is essential. Chopped bell peppers make a healthy, crunchy addition; I use an orange one for the color contrast. Other good additions are sliced olives, small pinto beans, sliced radishes, or diced hot peppers. I even add diced ham or salami and diced provolone sometimes. Make this at least a few hours early, cover, and place in the frig so the veggies have time to absorb all the great flavors.",

I microwaved the corn still in the husks for 2 minutes per ear (or out of the husk and wrapped in plastic wrap for 2 minutes per ear) then followed the directions from there. It's been awhile since I made it but I think I used a white onion (or maybe a yellow one). It makes a pretty good amount of salad. If you're looking for quick and easy this is it. It'll definitely serve a lot of people. UPDATE: I made this for a Labor Day bbq and instead of chopping tomatoes (they all looked terrible at the grocery) I halved a container of grape tomatoes. They were perfect delicious and very pretty. I'll only do this in the future. I also chopped a large Vidalia onion. Yummy. I make this all the time and everyone always loves it.",

The dressing holds together better, and all the vinegar droplets get the benefit of the spices, making sure every bite is well seasoned. It's about the spiced vinegar being suspended in the oil. Just my 2 cents, but it makes a taste difference. I make a similar salad, but use green onions. And lemon in the vinaigrette. Otherwise, it's the same, and VERY tasty, especially if you dress it about 15 minutes before serving to let the flavors do their thing.",

The salad keeps really well and I liked that it was so light and refreshing without the standard mayo dressing. I am making this again for a church picnic this weekend. Because sweet corn is not quite in season here I had to do canned corn. I have to tell you it worked just fine. I used three cans of corn and the ratio for dressing was great. I too used red wine vinegar and will use that again and changed the basil to cilantro. I also cooked the onion for a short time and thought it was better than raw. I think next time I will add a little feta cheese when I serve it. Do not hesitate to serve this it is so colorful and just feels like summer!!",
