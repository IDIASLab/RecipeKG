You cook it at the beginning, then it's never mentioned again in the directions.  So I had to improvise.  I used about 4 cups frozen broccoli florets and cooked them in the microwave.  I then put about half in the food processor and minced them.  I then dumped all the broccoli (florets and minced) in the pot at the end right before adding the cheese.  Who knows if this is what the recipe writer intended, but my husband and I enjoyed it!  It would probably also be good if you just pureed all the stuff together, though I liked the full florets.  The only change I would make is to omit the celery.  It doesn't add anything, and its flavor sticks out too much among all the other mellow blended flavors of the soup.",

I don't think heavy cream is necessary in this recipe. I used 2 cups whole milk and it was plenty rich. I might try reduced fat milk next time and see if I like it more. I just chopped up the cooked broccoli once it was cooled and added it after the cheese and liked the consistency. Also if you don't have shredded mozzarella already save time by cubing it instead of shredding it melts pretty quickly in the pot.",
