We made this for the first time and after the first batch, had to make some immediate modifications.  There was no flavor to the batter, so we added seasoning salt (tons), regular salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper.  Don't be afraid to season the dry mix AND egg mix.  Also, we changed the dry mix to bisquik which made the batter much lighter and fluffier  .  The idea of this recipe is great and the core is great, just needed some modifications.  Thanks!",

Oh my gosh, they were so so good. My husband, who doesn't even really like onion rings, ate himself silly. So did my 6 year old daughter. I can tell this will be a much requested recipe.",

The batter stayed on the rings nicely when frying (the other recipes I tried were not nearly as cooperative! lol) I added a bit of garlic powder and dried parsley to the flour mixure but next time I will add more. Maybe some cajun spices or something to give it a bit of a kick! Will definitely be making these again!:)",
