I followed the recipe to the word, but the first thing that didn't work was the size of the casserole dish. I used a larger dish than stated but still could not fit all the macaroni into the dish. I will try this recipe once again cutting back on the macaroni to 16 oz. I'm hoping that works because it does have a good flavor, but it's way too dry otherwise.",

I poached some chicken breasts in chicken stock and once they were done I removed and boiled the macaroni in the remaining chicken stock.  I followed the directions for microwaving the sauce but added the shredded chicken before I mixed it with the macaroni.  Once I mixed the chicken, sauce and macaroni I had a feeling that it was going to be a little dry once it was baked but didn't make any correction.  After baking it was very dry.  The next time I make I will approximately a 1/2 cup of milk to the sauce before I combine with the macaroni.  Overall a great recipe, just add a little milk to the sauce.",

I used an aluminum roasting pan 16 1/8 x 113/4 x 2 7/8 and it was the perfect size. I tried one jar of classic alfredo and one garlic alfredo. I'm not sure if it was the brand but the garlic alfredo gave it an after taste so I will try a different brand or just classic from now on. First time I made it I drizzled a cup of 2% milk over the whole pan. It was very creamy. Second time I forgot the milk but luckily it was still creamy enough. I cooked it 40 minutes. I did not use breadcrumbs because I have never liked a crust on mac n cheese lol. It was delicious besides the after taste from garlic alfredo.",
