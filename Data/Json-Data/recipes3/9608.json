So I hesitate to give 5 stars since it's not the same recipe as written nor do I want to give it too few because if you are like me you look for how many folks like something and this is great even w/o the cream...Today what's in the fridge is peas and fresh mushrooms and cooked bacon. However I already made some creamed corn off this site and did not want two creamed dishes in one meal. So I simply left out the MSG (allergic and morally adverse)and the heavy cream. Tastes wonderful. Thanks!",
