I wrapped the bacon around the chops and placed it seam-side down over the beef (avoiding the use of toothpicks) and added some minced onion & garlic to the sour cream/soup mix. I think this recipe would be good w/out the dried beef too & its abscense might make it a little less salty. Unfortunately for us - I halved the recipe but since we were all fighting for the last chop = never again! Chops were fork tender (after 1.5 hrs baking) and I will use this recipe often! Thanks Jennifer!",

I did make a few changes though--used turkey bacon and more of it (three for each chop) and left out the dried beef since I didnt' have any. This took forever to cook--I've never made any meat on 275 degrees in my oven! It took about 1 hour and 45 min but every oven is different. It is a low temp though so I wonder about the comments that it was dry. I was hoping it'd be done at an hour but no such luck. This is quite salty even without the dried beef so it'd probably be way too salty with the dried beef. I also think it needs a bit more flavor--some garlic maybe some pepper and other seasonings. I added garlic to the cream of soup mixture but it wasn't quite enough for me. Bf liked this as well. I wouldn't make it very often bc of how heavy it is (I barely ate any dinner since I had this for lunch) but when bf starts making noises about cream of mushroom soup being a nice change I suppose I could try this one again.
