I also used sweet relish instead of dill (because that was all I had) but I think I would have liked it better with dill... but it's still not a deal breaker! I used a little more cheese and added some franks red hot sauce because I put that on everything... I also used hot pepper rings and it had a wonderful flavor!! I love this!",
