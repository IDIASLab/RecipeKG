Is it 3 little store-bought zucchini or 3 big zucchini from the garden? I made a half batch and grated one good-sized garden variety that yielded 2.5 cups or so grated which I squeezed as much excess liquid out as I could. Once baked golden brown in the top sides and bottom I topped with some shredded cheddar and baked a few minutes to melt the cheese. They smelled wonderful but when I cut in they were completely soggy underneath. I tried to bake a little longer but it didn't help. Maybe they're supposed to be that way like a corn pudding as opposed to corn bread you know? I ate the browned edges and the flavors are yummy but the super-soggy texture did not work for us sorry.",

I used a cheese biscuit mix (MC). I lightly sauteed 1/2 an onion & drained in on a paper towel. Sometimes, often, onions w/release liquid in the baking process & make things soggy. Dry parmesan usually helps but I added an additional egg & some extra sharp cheddar(1/3 cup in the mix & about the same on top after the last 5 minutes). I did not put in the pepperoni in.

Skipped pepperoni.\" Halved this recipe as a side dish for 4 salmon cakes (Chef John's recipe), and prepared it in an 8\" square dish, and my zucchini was large-ish. I let the grated zucchini and chopped onion drain in a dish towel-lined colander for a few hours, squeezing out excess moisture b4 mixing it into the other ingredients. Other than that part of the preparation (and not using pepperoni), I stuck to the recipe. It was a nice, light side dish, and honestly, tasted better the following morning re-heated for breakfast. I think making it again, I'd add a shake of crushed red pepper and some mushrooms (that I would lightly-sautee w/ the onions b/c the one thing we didn't care for in this was the raw onions.)",
