I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt. I used only 2TBS of lite melted butter (6 is way too much). Melted butter works better because it's easier to mix the seasonings in with the potatoes. I baked the potatoes for an hour the night before. The next day at work, I put the potatos in a crock pot, added the cheese, Ranch dressing, garlic and bacon pieces and cooked on low for 3 hours to melt the chesse. By lunch time it was all ready and it turned out perfect! I had A LOT of people ask for the recipe. It was the first dish to be completely eaten! And the best part was it was so easy to make!! The hardest part was cutting all the potatoes. I will denfinately be making this many more times!",

After reading several reviews with tweaking suggestions, here is what I did to produce the delectable result:  I cubed red potatoes, leaving the skin on. I cut the butter amount by 1/3, and saut\u00e9ed 1/2 cup chopped onion in it until softened.  I then added the seasonings, and poured the mixture over the potatoes in the casserole dish, tossing to coat.  After baking, I added 1/4 real bacon bits, along with the cheese and dressing, to the potatoes.  The dish accompanied charcoal grilled hamburgers--a VERY tasty meal!  I will definitely make this potato dish again and again.",

Although this dish was very tasty I found that the butter made the dish extremely greasy. I felt that spraying the baking dish lightly with oil would have been adequate and that the butter was really quite unnecessary. I made the dish a second time completely omitting the butter it was definitely less greasy hence a much healthier potato bake. The chilli powder gives this dish a bit of oomph and was a great addition. I will definitely make my version of this dish again. Thank you for the recipe.",

Since my initial foray into this recipe I have since reduced the butter to 1.5 tbsps of butter and I cannot detect any loss of flavor. HELPFUL HINTS: Use Simply Potatoes with onions for ease in preparation and homemade Ranch dressing and Pepperjack cheese to increase flavor.
