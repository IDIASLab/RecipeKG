We poured a little beer over these while they were cooking (an old trick from my Dad) added a little ketchup some pickles and a side of kettle cooked chips (oh and a couple of beers).",

We use either a Vidalia or a red onion sliced thin yummy! If you happen to be frying your hamburgers instead of grilling you can also use the same principle for the buns indoors just place butter in a pan and lay your buns open side down in the hot pan. Lots of restaurants prepare their buns this way on their grills. Hubby likes to add bacon to his burgers kids omit tomatoes. It's all good.",
