The ginger (which I love to cook with) was too much and it didn't go well with the stout; the flavors combined to give the dish a fairly bitter taste. The only way we were able to eat it was to mix it with soba noodles and add a dose of soy sauce. We didn't even keep the leftovers. I think this might have been better with a sweeter beer such as a honey brew or an amber ale. Thanks anyway.",
