Here are my tips: 1) Use more garlic 2) Use half the butter 3) Add a little white wine 4)  Stir-fry the broccoli with the garlic and tomatoes - that way it won't get overcooked 5) Top with Parmesan for serving. Now, you will have a delicious dish. =)",

I tossed my shrimp in basil, oregano, red and black pepper, and salt\nI had some fresh asparagus that needed to be used. Saute the broccoli,asparagus, 1 large mushroom, lots of garlic, and jar of fire roasted peppers, plus the can of tomatoes, not drained. To this I added a few more dashes of red pepper flakes because it seemed bland. After about 5 minutes, I added the shrimp and it was truly delicious.Don't forget to add some white wine when you put shrimp into the skillet. Will definitely make this dish again.",

That would be a TOMATO stir fry and you wouldn't see or taste anything else. I used one 8.5 oz jar and it was great. I'd suggest adding a little more shrimp if you want a meat-ier dish but it is still good. I am not giving this 5 STARS because there is a BIG problem when you put this all together. You end up with a large pile of pasta and all of the other ingredients don't \"mix\" with the rest. I'd suggest either leaving a tablespoon or so of the water you boiled the pasta in with the pasta after you drain it (a friend told me this would work but I haven't tried it) OR take the easy way and just don't mix it all in. Serve up the bowl of pasta and the top it with the shrimp/tomato mixture. This tasted really good but presentation was off.",
