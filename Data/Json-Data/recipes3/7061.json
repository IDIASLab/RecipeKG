I put some sundried tomatoes on top of the cheese and also some on top of the egg mixture.  I highly recommend using the goat cheese rather than another kind, as the goat cheese imparts a very distinct flavor that can stand up to the strong flavors of pesto and sundried tomatoes.  I also recommend reducing the heat down to 375F as at 400F, the crust was very brown before the eggs were set, I had to tent the crust with foil.  Good recipe.",
