I made it today again with 3 boneless chicken breas.ts I boiled the chicken breasts added garlic salt and chicken bouillon to the water. I then used the cooking water for my broth. I left out the tarragon added 1/4 tsp rosemary and 1/4 tsp thyme 1/8 tsp fresh black pepper and it made 6 nice sized crepes. There is plenty of sauce. So if you are looking to make 12 crepes use more chicken I love this recipe it is delicious and versatile.",

We love onions here so I used about 1/2 cup of finely diced onions. I also ended up baking the dish for 30 minutes (that's when it got nice and bubbly). Even though it was a lot of work I really enjoyed putting a different kind of dish on the table and everyone liked it alot. I served it with green beans almondine on the side. Enjoy!:)",
