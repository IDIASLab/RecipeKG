I did add some red pepper flakes and a little red wine to the sauce and had to use a can of basil oregano and garlic canned tomatoes (what was on hand need to buy canned tomatoes) otherwise followed the recipe. This is the first time that I ve ever bought frozen cooked chicken and it actually was pretty tasty. Honestly although not difficult I doubt that I ll make the sauce again as I m not convinced it was worth the effort. You can buy a jar of good-quality marinara sauce that measures up pretty well doing nothing more than seasoning to suit your taste and at the end of a busy day it would be a much simpler way to enjoy this tasty crispy chicken. It was a nice dinner enjoyed with a simple salad and hot baguette.",
