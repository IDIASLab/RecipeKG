I made some for myself, sans the elk, and I was amazed at how delicious parsnips are.  I followed the recipe to a T for everyone and they raved about the elk version. I felt especially proud that I can still cook a \"meat\" dish that tastes delicious. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!",

Delish!! Because I have to feed a large family I doubled the recipe and baked this in a deep casserole dish. This is a fantastic recipe and my family has requested that it be served regularly.
