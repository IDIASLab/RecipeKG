I used Barilla GF Tortiglioni instead of rotini. Thankfully this GF pasta holds up to this recipe like a trouper. No split pieces nor gummy texture just real pasta as a perfect vehicle to get all the sausage and veggies into your mouth. Be really Italian and add some hot peppers when saut\u00e9ing the broccoli rabe and top the final plates with toasted plain bread crumbs... you won't be sorry. Grazie nonna Barilla for the recipe.:-)",

Substituted GF for regular penne pasta (all I had) added a 1/2tsp (1 clove) more minced garlic used 1 cup of pasta water for simmering instead of 1/2 cup AND used close to 1 cup of Parmesan since we love cheese. My family seasoned their portions with garlic salt and pepper before eating and it helped with taste issues (we thought it was a bit bland without it) Will definitely be making again! Want to try with other veggies like spinach or mushrooms YUM",
