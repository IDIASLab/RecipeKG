For anyone thinking of making this, here's a few suggestions:  1) Don't skip making the pico de gallo. . . that's what makes this recipe so good.  The flavor is wonderful!  2) Reading through the reviews, it appears some of you are having problems flipping the 12\" tortilla.  Here's a quick and easy way to flip it.  When the tortilla is ready to flip, take a dinner plate and lay it upside down in the pan on top of the tortilla.  Put your hand on top of the plate and flip the entire pan over so that the plate and tortilla are now in your hand.  Now, simply slide the tortilla back into the pan and \"voila\" your flipped without the mess!",

Using fresh cilantro is imperitive to the overall good taste, as are fresh ripened tomatoes.  I followed your recipe to a T, but did prepare the pico de gallo about 3 hours prior to cooking to let the flavors completely meld.  I also did mine in the oven, lightly coating the lower tortilla with canola oil, then adding the cheese and ingredients, and coating the top tortilla lightly with oil, and baked in a 375 degree oven for about 20 to 25 minutes.  Again, mucho gracios for this delicious recipe.  I will quadruple the recipe the next time in order to feed a few friends.  GordonGoodGuy, and Chef Extrordinaire.",

The pico de gallo stands alone and can be made as dip for tortilla chips..outstanding!  I would recommend NOT boiling/stewing the chicken as another reviewer suggests, because so much of the flavor comes from the chicken pan drippings created by cooking it in the olive oil.  It provides that essential grilled-type taste like fajitas.  Also, DO use the plate and slide method another reviewer suggests...absolutely no problems with turning them over or messiness.  One final tip: don't load up the centermost part of the quesadilla because when you cut it like a pie to eat, the tip is overweighted and makes for a messy meal with  filling falling out too easily.  Muchas gracias, Senor Cortez. Era lo mejor!",

It was no longer than to fix a typical evening meal. I will say that I did use the pre-cooked and sliced southwestern chicken slices (I'm sure that saved quite a bit of time - other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was soooo good - especially the pico de gallo. The grocery store didn't have any jalapeno peppers - just anaheim - still turned out excellent. My husband and I are on a low carb diet - we just used low-carb tortillas gave the kids flour tortillas and it was great. (I followed the advice of another reviewer - I sprayed olive oil in a pan placed a tortilla on the bottom placed all the ingredients on put another torilla on top sprayed it with olive oil and baked in a 350 oven for about 10 minutes and it turned out perfect.",

In addition after filling the tortillas with the cheese and chicken mix I just heated them in the oven for a few minutes (rather than heating over the stove steps).

This pico is totally missing the heat by only using one jalapeno (and this is coming from someone who doesn't like things too spicy.) If I make this again I would up it to at least 1 1/2 jalapenos. I also noticed no spices were used on the chicken. I wanted these to be tasty so a few minutes before I threw my chicken in the grill pan I sprinkled lime juice chili powder cumin garlic powder onion powder salt and pepper over them. Next time I will let the chicken marinate in it for at least a few hours. The actual quesadillas were okay but they still weren't packing the punch I was looking for. I did not cook these in the oven or on the stove but instead used my Quesadilla Maker. I served them with chips and guacamole or salsa. I'm not quite sure where the almost 5 star rating is coming from these are average quesadillas that could be improved by using a lot more seasonings. The recipe as written is a 3 and even with my adding of extra ingredients into them I still would only give them a 4.",
