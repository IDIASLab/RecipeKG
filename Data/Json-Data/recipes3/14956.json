It is important to let it sit for those 10 minutes. The taste was ok if you like coconut flour you will enjoy the taste of this crepe. They don't roll well and they are a bit tricky to flip. Follow the instructions on flipping make sure they are completely cooked on one side or you'll get pieces. They also have a texture that is not like a true crepe it's not chewy but dry. Next time I will add an extra egg or as another reviewer states start off with a smaller amount of coconut flour and work from there. Another alternative could be an addition of fat to the recipe. I noticed this recipe doesn't call for any fat in the batter this may be a solution for the next time to add either coconut oil or olive oil directly into the batter. Thank you kmacphee for sharing this recipe.",

I couldn't finish eating the crepes I would not make this again.",

In my experience you need a much smaller amount I coconut flour than regular flour and my traditional crepe recipe would have had this same amount.
