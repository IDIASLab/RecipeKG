Here are the changes I'm going to make next time. Although I get why the peanuts are supposed to be on the top and bottom (inspired by the candy bar)It was too peanuty taking away from that awesome chewy fudgey center. So Im going to reduce the amount of nuts not lining the pan with then and instead chop some up and mix them in with the melty mixture. Then I'll line my baking pan with parchment paper. I'm still going to top the mixture with peanuts though. This is just my preference and reallyI still think this recipe is awesome and will definitely make again.",
