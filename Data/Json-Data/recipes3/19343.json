Used white grape juice because I had it on hand; microwave 5 minutes in the juice because I was short on time, then roasted it \u2013 WONDERFUL!  I wanted to dress it up a little, so I added half an onion (wedged) and several sprigs of rosemary and roasted until onion was done.  This really gave it piazza and more variety to the flavor.  My father-in-law (who is not at all adventuresome with food) loved it and asked my mother-in-law to get the recipe!",

I did change the preparation method, however: I tossed all of the vegetable cubes in olive oil and roasted them for about half an hour while I reduced the apple cider & wine. I added the cider-wine glaze to the pans and roasted an additional 15 minutes or so, until the glaze caramelized and any extra liquid had evaporated. I didn't use the butter, since I'd used olive oil for roasting. It looks like a ton when you're making it, but I think the number of servings is pretty accurate.",

I cut the onion into wedges trimmed the ends and cut a half inch cross into the bottom of the brussel sprouts and cut the sweet potato and rutabaga into fries. Tossed with olive oil salt and pepper on a big sheet pan (with 1 inch sides) 4oz each of apple juice and a fruity piniot grigio--didn't reduce it just pored into the pan with the veggies. Baked for 40 min taking the sweet potato out after 25 min and turning the veggies in the liquid remaining in the bottom of the pan. Back in the oven for another 15min. Perfect carmelization and could have put the photo on the cover of Gourmet Magazine. (Too bad my batteries were dead in the camera). I will serve this tomorrow nite at room temp with a drizzle of balsamic & olive oiil along side Firecracker Grilled Alaska Salmon (from this site) and wild rice pilaf. Make sure you use good wine. If you don't want to drink it--don't cook with it as it will intensify the flavor it reduces. I used Clos Du Bois but any good quality white wine would be good. Thanks for posting this recipe.",

I was impatient and didn't boil the apple juice and wine enough before adding the butter and pouring over the veggies. I felt guilty and pulled them out of the oven after 5 minutes or so drained it and put the apple juice and wine back on the stove to reduce further. Then I reduced it too much! I poured the mixture over the veggies again and threw it in the oven for a second time. I let it cook for about 35 mintues and it turned out great! So yummy! I used a couple of sweet potatoes some carrots and parsnips. The veggies had a nice flavour and had a bit of a gourmet taste to them. Not your typical cooked veggies. I'll make this again; thanks Christine.",

Although come to think of it the veggies really ought to be the main dish! Don't be afraid to make this recipe even if you're missing one or two of the vegetables called for; I've made it with and without carrots and regular potatoes and loved it each time. Unfortunately scrubbing pealing and chopping this number of vegetables is quite time-consuming; if it weren't this would be a staple in my house instead of just a special occasion dish. UPDATE 11/25/10: Cut your roasting time by pre-boiling the veggies for a bit. This also helps prevent the veggies from drying out and developing sharp hard edges.",
