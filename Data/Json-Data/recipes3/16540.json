I have always made the Lucsious Spinach Artichoke Dip from this website and my husband and I both thought this recipe was MUCH better and creamier than the other recipe. For my alfredo sauce I used leftover Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce also from this website. Maybe the people who don't like this recipe aren't using a good alfredo sauce?? The only change I made was that I topped it with some mozzarella cheese and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. We had it with tortilla chips and my little girl ate a whole bowl of it as is! This is my new favorite recipe!",
