I had to make a few tweaks out of necessity (read: lack of prior planning). I forgot to pick up coriander so I subbed 1/2 tsp of cumin in it's stead. Our grocery store had no leeks so I used some green onion and upped the garlic. I had white potatoes that needed used so that's what I went with. I thought I had a Colby mix but only had sharp cheddar so in it went and I also used milk in place of the high fat (and more delicious for sure) heavy whipping cream. I also did add salt and about 1/2 tsp of white pepper. This came together quickly and we liked it especially with the chives on top. THANKS for the recipe!",
