The only thing I think I would do next time is to put the herbs into a tied cheesecloth b/c the rosemary leaves fell off the branch and were all over the potatoes (which would normally be fine but I had to pick them all out for hubby's sake lol). Other than that and adding more salt than called for to taste this had great flavor and I will def be making these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
