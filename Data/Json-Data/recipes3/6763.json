I use 2/3 of a cup of 2% milk and it helps make the dough a little easier to work with. Also I tried it with Robin Hood Bread and Roll Mix flour (don't use the yeast packets that it comes with). They come out almost scone-like! Really amazing in the mornings with ham and cheese. Have made these numerous times and they always turn out well. Thanks for this recipe!",
