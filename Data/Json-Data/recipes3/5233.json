This was a a nice departure from my usual tuna salad - slightly sweet and great on lightly toasted whole grain bread!",

Doubled maybe even tripled the cranberries a generous dose of dill and salt -- lots of almonds -- and when even then it seemed a little ho-hum I added some minced onions like another reviewer suggested. Now THAT is what I am talking about! Much more like you might eat at a restaurant or something. I served it on croissants though I think it would be good on toasted wheat or anything really. A good start of a recipe but much yummier with more flavor...Thanks for sharing though!",
