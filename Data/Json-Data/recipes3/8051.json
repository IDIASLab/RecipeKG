        "description": "A pot of yummy deliciousness, that's what this soup is. Good for a chilly day when a bowl of warm soup is just what you need, or when you want to use up your fresh summer veggies. Goes well with a loaf of crusty Italian bread. You can put pretty much any vegetable combination in this soup. I have used chopped fresh okra; it's good for a nice pop in your mouth. You can also use pearled barley in place of the oro pasta. Just add it to the soup when you put in the veggies, and an extra cup of water. I like that it makes a big pot, because it's even better as leftovers.",

I didn't think the orzo would work, but I added it anyway and it was perfect.\nThe recipe makes a large amount so I will freeze 3 quarts and have plenty on hand for other cold night suppers.\nThanks for posting such a good soup recipe.",
