I only had time to marinate the chicken breasts for about 30 minutes, so I pounded them too to ensure that the marinate would soak in well and it did.  The marinade gives such a delicate flavor, yet it's definitely there.  I had never grilled asparagus before and it was fabulous.  For the greens, I used romaine from our garden, mixed with baby spinach, and I tossed in a sprinkling of feta cheese which was lovely.  This dressing is just great and I will use it for other salads.  Thank you, Pam Anderson, for a wonderful recipe!",

I left about one-fifth of the bottle for the dressing. Next time I will let them marinate overnight to see if there is a difference; this time they sat for about nine hours. For the asparagus I lightly drizzled it with olive oil and fresh lemon zest before I put them on the grill to get them nice and hot. I subsituted the mixed greens for spinach kept the oranges. For the dressing I had pineapple-orange-banana fruit juice on hand and filled the mojo bottle to be about half-full. It was a great fruity but fun combination and everyone loved it!",

Next I used canned mandarin oranges rather than fresh. The greens part needs some jazzing up. Next time I will add feta cheese & either spicy pumpkin seeds or carmelized pecans. The marinade is great but as a dressing I thought it was a bit too much orange. I will probably add more lime juice next time. Very good summer recipe. All the women I had over for my patio party LOVED it. I also made Lemon Posset from this site for dessert & cucumber slices topped with dill seasoned cream cheese mixed with a can of crab meat for an appetizer.",
