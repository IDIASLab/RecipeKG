I think some sour cream and more salt than I used would be helpful. I did them as individual potatoes instead of layering them in a dish bc I just didn't see any advantage to that for me. It was just as easy to spoon back into the shells as to smear it around. Maybe easier. Thanks for sharing!",

The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the turmeric should be replaced with something else. It didn't fit in my opinion. Overall good recipe and one I would make again with small changes.",

Could be a winner with a few tweaks!",
