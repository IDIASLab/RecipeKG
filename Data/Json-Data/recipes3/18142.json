                "reviewBody": "I've made this recipe a few times but I must admit I've never used Cream of Bacon soup. I've always used Cream of Shrimp and added about 4 strips of thinly sliced bacon which I fry first then drain the grease and add about a tsp of evoo and sauteed the garlic until fragrant before adding the rest of the ingredients. I omitted the lemon as it has no place mixed with the smokey flavor of bacon. I split the water and replaced half of it with dry sherry which I used to semi-deglase the pan with after the bacon and garlic. That being said last time I made it I decided to follow to method described here against my better judgement as a full blooded Italian trained to cook pasta dishes since I was 8 yrs old. The other times I made it I had made the pasta separately as it should be. This time with adding the pasta (I used fettuccini for larger shrimp) to the same pan it stuck together. I had to constantly stir and add water. In the end I had to actually pick pieces up by hand to separate so some pieces were cooked more than others. Not to mention the pasta was drowned in sauce (not very Italian just my preference). If I have leftovers the pasta will absorb all the liquid and the pasta will be too mushy. My suggestion would be with any dish make the pasta separately and add the sauce as you serve. Otherwise this is the basis of a great recipe and one of my go- to's.",
