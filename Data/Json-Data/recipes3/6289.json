Sigh Thank goodness they're pretty much interchangeable! I added a little chopped green onion and some softened cream cheese and in so doing found I didn't need to add any milk at all. I don t know what it is about the simple and humble additions of nutmeg rutabagas er turnips and bacon to the potatoes but there WAS something special and different about them albeit quietly understated. It really dressed up basic mashed potatoes. I reserved some of the bacon and green onion to garnish the top which really prettied them up.",

The turnips give it a pleasant \"bitterness\" but the flavor is not so overpowering that it conflicts with any of the other holiday offerings. Especially good when topped with gravy. A couple of suggestions: (a) include the bacon grease when folding in the crumbled bacon; (b) crumble the bacon really fine (the kids LOVE it when they come across these little treasure bits); and (c) add a finely chopped yellow onion for a little bit more of a \"kick\". Chicken or vegetable broth can be substituted for the milk. A dollop of sour cream (and perhaps some chives) go very well with this dish when it's prepared as a side for a normal weekday meal.",
