This makes a difference in how evenly it cooks.  I have used the stack cooker by tupperware and the largest round stainshield by rubbermaid.  Things you can try to change up the taste: adding a can of green chillies, or salsa, or topping with crushed crackers (cheese-its, Ritz, or chicken-in-a-biscuit, etc), or topping with fried onions (original or cheese flavored), fried jalapenos.  Combine a few of these or just try one.  Just gives you some different takes on this recipe.  NOTE: Really doesn't need more salt especially with any of these add-in ideas.  Maybe pepper though!",

I just tried this recipe and I'm amazed at how good it is. I didn't have any trouble heating it; I used a smaller casserole dish and only used half a bag of tater tots, and it heated fairly thoroughly, though I think next time I'll defrost the tots for longer. Also, when I stirred the mixture into the tots, my broke up a lot of them with my spoon and I think that made it heat more thoroughly.\nAll in all, great recipe. I'll be making this a lot in the next few years !",

With the cheese and ham I probably could have done garlic powder--it got a little salty. Plan on taking more like 20 min to cook with stirring about every 5 min.",
