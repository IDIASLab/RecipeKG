I ended up mixing it until it was all smooth and it turned out way to sticky that I had to scoop it out with a spoon. OOPS! I added both white and dark chocolate chips to these. And to give it an added flavor add about a teaspoon of either vanilla or almond extract to it they both are great!",

Also I found that its best not to soften the butter but to whip it up cold. These are very good though. I made them the other night for my parents party. We had also ordered some cookies from a bakery but all of my cookies got eaten long before the bakery ones. All the guests kept asking my mom for the recipe.",
