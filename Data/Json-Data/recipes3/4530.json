In addition I thought the overall result was rather tasteless. I personally didn't care for this recipe and won't be using it again:-(",

Also I decided to add diced green onions (four for this recipe size) because I love green onions and I felt the lemon would be too sweet (Meyers lemons). I suggest combining the ingredients as you put the eggs to boil. This gives the flavors a chance to meld. Then once the eggs are done let them cool for an hour before blending it all into a \"sauce.\" Combine remaining ingredients and then let it sit in the refrigerator over night to set up a bit. Served with home made dill crackers for an awesome lunch!!",
