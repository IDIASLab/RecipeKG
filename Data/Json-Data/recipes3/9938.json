I used some homemade bread from the freezer that I believe was \"fake\" sourdough and that worked fine. I also broke down and very lightly sprayed them with a mist of EVOO because my bread was dry and the seasonings wouldn't stick. After the 6 min they were crispy on the outside and a little tender/chewy on the inside. I left them about 2 more minutes and it made them too crunchy. We used them all so I don't know how well they would have stored. Next time I'll try just the 6 min and see how they cool.",
