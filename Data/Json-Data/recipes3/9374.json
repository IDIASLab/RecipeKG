This was supposed to be a filling for the empanada, but when I was making it one day I messed up the dough and ended up not knowing what to do with the filling, so I just took a piece of bread and slapped some of the filling on bread; and I was like 'This isn't so bad.' Ever since then, it's one of my favorite recipes. Hope you guys like it! Garnish with kale leaves if desired.",

I cooked and mashed and it took a lot of effort and strength to try to 'mash' the broccoli - and all the mashing was just starching out the potatoes. In the end I shut the gas and put the mixture into a glass Corningware baking dish and tightly covered it. And waited the 10 -15 minutes for the broccoli to truly finish softening. When I chose this recipe I did not expect needing to stand over a hot frying pan stirring for close to 15 minutes and then finding that the mashing needed some serious muscle",
