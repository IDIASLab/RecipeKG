One of the things I did different after reading everyones reviews was - slicing the onion - too many people remarked on the water in the bottom of the pan - so - I cut the onion about an inch thick, then sliced it in half again.Then I spaced the onion in the bottom of the pan so that I could balance the hamburger on top of the onion. I used a glass dish. I also added some cheese - any kind you preferred would work ! I used a blend of mozzarella, provolone, romano, and parmesan. The other thing I did on accident - was I used deer meat. I dont do deer meat- I did that night! Cant wait to try using hamburger !  MY HUSBAND loved it ! Add some fried potato's - I have to admitt it was awesome! Thank you so much! I really enjoy reading what you guys write in about the recipes you try. Thanks!  Daygoingraham",

                "reviewBody": "I initially read this recipe because it sounded so odd, then decided to give it a try. I had a bag of frozen hamburger patties I'd previously made up from a big package of beef I'd bought earlier, so I was not able to put anything in the hamburger patties. Instead I sprinkled them with Montreal steak seasoning about an hour ahead of time. I then followed the recipe except I used beef broth in the dish rather than water. I also made up some gravy to serve over them which just seemed to fit with the delicious onions. I followed the advice of others and sliced the onions pretty thick to keep the patties out of the liquid, consequently I felt I had to bake them at least 45 minutes to have the onions cooked well. The onions were so good, I think next time I will fill the entire bottom of the dish with onions. The extra onions will be gobbled up. My picky eaters thought this was one of the best things they'd ever eaten. It reminded me somewhat of a country fried steak. A definite Keeper!",

Be careful how much water you put in the bottom of your casserole dish once the burgers start cooking the juices from the burgers mix with the water and the level raises a bit. Really a great recipe and will be making again!",

I did follow the advice of other reviewers making sure I only used just enough water to line the bottom of the pan and not too much (covering the onions).

This added flavor to the onions combined with the juices from the meat after it was done. To complete the meal I put each burger with some of the onions on a toasted hamburger bun with a side of broccoli and a side of macaroni.",

I did not have a problem with them coming out soggy although I did cut my onions pretty thick so the hamburgers were not in the water. Both my 3 year old daughter and my husband loved them. I prepared them pretty much as the recipe shows except I added about a 1/4 cup of bacon bits to the hamburger mixture. I also made up a batch of brown gravy to serve alongside the steaks. Will be making this again. Thanks",
