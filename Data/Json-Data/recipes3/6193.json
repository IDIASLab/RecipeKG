Made a sauce using 2 minced garlic cloves and 1 diced white onion sauteed in olive oil, a can of italian stewed tomatoes (undrained) and a little tomato paste. Let that thicken up and spooned over the chicken when it came out of the oven. Topped with shredded mozarella and baked about 5 min longer, until cheese melted. Served over spaghetti tossed with olive oil, salt and pepper! This will be a regular in our house. Simple and Delicious! Thanks for sharing!:)",

I used a 1:1 ratio of crumbs and cheese, substituted fresh oregano for the dried, and butter for the margarine.  The aroma made your mouth water as this was baking. Cooking time spot on accurate - the chicken comes out moist and tender.  Quick, easy and satisfying, this is a consistently reliable way to prepare chicken breasts.",

Got extra coating left over?  we cook it, flake it out, and its a great topping to add a bit of extra jazz to the pasta. ",
