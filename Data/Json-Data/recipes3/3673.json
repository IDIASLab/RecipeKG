To save time you could use packaged egg noodles and use frozen chopped kale thawed. I added salt at the end per directions but it really needs to be added in the beginning to properly season the soup (adding it the end just didn't permeate the broth well). Next time I'll add 1 tsp. salt to the chicken and garlic. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!",

I just used chicken breasts since I didn't have a whole chicken on hand and breasts are easier to shred after boiling. I added a can of chicken broth towards the end to add more broth and flavor since it was getting a little thick for me. I nixed the kale since I didn't have any and don't care for the flavor. But I added frozen peas instead. It took a ton of salt curry and poultry seasoning to beef up the flavor. I like to be patient with my soups and continue layering the flavors. Including adding more garlic towards the end. The outcome was fanatastic though and my kids loved it. We added a healthy dollop of sour cream before serving. Will make again. Thank you.",

Also because I didn't make that recipe - I didn't have all the ingredients O:) Basically I followed the recipe but with chicken thighs and I left out the cilantro and kale. I used 2 regular onions and frozen spinach. Also I doubled the spices and ended up having to add in an extra 4 cups of stock. And come to think of it now that I look at the recipe again I completely forgot to put in the balsamic vinegar.... I might go back and add that to see what happens. What I'm eating is pretty darn yummy nonetheless. Also in my opinion it's the homemade egg noodles that really make this good. I would NOT recommend subbing store bought pasta unless you're in a huge hurry.",
