I think if you cut the oil in half it might have been edible. Even then it is all juice so I'm not sure how you would ever put this on a hamburger or cold cut sandwich as the recipe submitter mentions. I'm thinking maybe there was supposed to be some mayo in the ingredient list that got left out?",
