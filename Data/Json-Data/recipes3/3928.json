I used dried parsley instead of cilantro (since I hate cilantro... I know I'm crazy). I also used Vermouth instead or Port Wine. The steamed white rice didn't go very well with this dish as the marinade / sauce was very strong. Next time I will add the marinade / sauce to the pork while it is cooking and simmer it down. This should thicken the marinade / sauce considerably and give the pork even more flavor. I will also serve the pork inside of pita bread with tzatziki sauce. As the brocolli didn't fit well either next time I will use red potatoes as the side dish.",

I did add some mushrooms and a bit of green onion to color it up a bit. I will definately be making this one again. Thanks for posting.",

I then tossed the pork in the sauce and cooked it through. We ate the pork wrapped in lettuce leaves and the texture complimented each other well. It's a five after the modifications.",

Didn't change a thing except I poured out the little remaining oil in the pan and added just a little of the oil red vinegar and port to the hot pan to deglaze it and poured it over the pork - couldn't let the taste of the browning go to waste! Then added the remainder of the whisked ingrediants to the pork. The minced garlic over the meat is a must. I didn't have fresh cilantro so used a tsp. of dried crushed it in the palm of my hand and sprinkled it on. We had it today a hot 90 degree day. I served it with Adrienne's Cucumber Salad (on site) using the first batch of fresh cucumbers from the back yard and sliced tomatoes. The rest of the Port wine was declicious over ice at the end of the meal with sliced apples pears and cheese. Felt like I was on the Riviera - again a very simple elegant meal - Oh yes definitely have the french bread to sop up the juice!!! Thanks Marlies - looking forward to serving this to company!!",
