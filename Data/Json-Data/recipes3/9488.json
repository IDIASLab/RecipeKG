I have suggested using red and green bell peppers because they are Christmas colors! I also use grated cheese and spread it over the Canadian bacon instead of cheese slices. I have used regular bacon in this recipe, but I find that it overpowers the rest of the flavors. Make this tasty breakfast dish the night before and just pop it in the oven on Christmas morning; let it cook while you open gifts and sip your rum-spiked coffee!",

Although after sitting for a while and later being refrigerated and reheated, that subsided.  The flavor was a bit odd too.  I'm not sure if was the mustard or what but it wasn't what I was expecting.  Note -- this dish puffs up enormously while baking so make sure you leave plenty of room between it and the upper over rack.  Mine actually got so huge while baking that some of it actually spilled over into the oven and caused some burning & smoking in the oven!",

I really liked the addition of the onion and peppers for flavor and I enjoyed the crunchy topping of corn flakes. I did reduce the butter also.",

Instead of regular bread I used a loaf of Brioche bread which is richer and more dense. It soaks up the liquid nicely. I also used crumbled  turkey sausage as we don't eat bacon. I love red and green pepper and added a little bit more than the recipe stated.  It helps to have the wife saver breakfast come to room temperature by having it sit on the counter for 30 min. after taking it out of the fridge.  This will eliminate having to cook it longer than necessary.  Excellent dish!",
