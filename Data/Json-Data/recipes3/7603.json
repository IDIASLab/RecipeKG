I made some revisions though and used balsamic vinegar instead of distilled white and I added some basil, panko bread crumbs and shredded mozzarella to the filling plus one small roma diced. I topped it off with some parmesan and baked for 10 minutes at 350. They were delicious! Thank you for providing the jumping off point for a spontaneous side dish!",

Also I added in some onion fresh basil garlic powder and used red wine vinegar. This reminded me of the tomato salads that we make all summer long but with a cute spin by using the whole hollowed out tomato. I think these would be wonderful w/ any salad additions that you like. Thank You for sharing this wonderful idea!:)",

I added about a teaspoon of onion to each mixture as well as a tiny bit of cheese. The outcome was if you want something super tangy and powerful go with regular vinegar. More of a mild flavor definitely the red wine vinegar. If you are looking for something that will remind you more of like bruschetta then the balsamic. All are great though the regular vinegar made my lips pucker lol. Never had such a sour tomato, but interestingly good.",
