I know from experience why her soup came out chunky and it can be explained by the method of blending.  \n\nShe mentions using over 8 beets.  I've made the soup with as little as 2 very large beets and with more than 8.  I have also added a couple carrots and sweet vidalia, just for the heck of it.  Both occasions with the addition of more vegetables, it still turned out smooth.  When writing a negative review its important to tell us what kind of blender or food processor was used and whether you were able to liquefy the soup in portions.  Properly.\n\nIf having 6 or more beets its important to be dutiful with blending. You may have to do it a couple more times to ensure you've done it correctly. Sometimes if you put less content in a container for blending the blades throw the chunks to the top and regardless of how much time you leave it blending, because the speed of the blades is so high the chunks never get blended correctly.  Its important to reconstitute different parts of it back into other parts and allow it to be liquefied again and again to ensure that its perfectly smooth.\n\nI've used a Magic Bullet blender and had some difficulty in getting the soup perfectly smooth. That's because you have a small capacity for blending which creates more work.  Which often equals a chunky soup.\n\n* Add chili powder to make it SPICY!",
