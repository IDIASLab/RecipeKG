I always have my dad make it when I visit home:) This recipe is pretty much how I make mine however there are a few difference: 1) I also add a pound of stewing beef to the oxtail to make it \"meatier\" 2) I don't use bok choy and it still has enough vegetables in it 3) I mix the peanut butter right into the broth - the heat melts it right away 4) I like using crunchy peanut butter for more texture. Great recipe! Everyone should try it:)",

However I made it a second time with the following changes/additions: First in addition to the oxtails I added about a pound of beef stew meat. (I am matriarch to a family of carnivores!) Then I browned all of the meat at high heat....using half canola and half olive oil and I lightly salted and peppered it. This step is so important (to me) in order to flavor the broth! Then I added about a cup of red wine to de-glaze the pot scraping all of the little crispies from browning the meat. From this point I followed the recipe pretty closely. (Pretty closely because I also added fresh Thai basil and marjoram when I added the veggies.) I served it over brown rice with a wonderful crusty Portuguese bread...it was really an international meal by the time I finished with it! All of my changes bumped the recipe to a 5-star but I don't know how authentic it is now! Thanks for the recipe!!",
