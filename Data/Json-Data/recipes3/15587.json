But even for the die-hard carnivores in my house, this makes an easy and delicious appetizer, quick snack, or side dish.  The breading is nice and light, and they are crispier than traditional breaded zucchini because they are baked rather than fried. They are good just as they are, but my son loves to dip his in ranch dressing!",

I even let them go another 10 minutes before flipping and they were so soggy that all of the breading mushed and fell off. The one side that retained most all of the breading never crisped up either and the majority of them still had the powdery flour surface. I've made plenty of zucchini chips in the oven so I'm not really sure what the problem is other than no egg. I loved the addition of cornmeal so I might try these again. I'm not vegan and will be using an egg if I do. I also think that it would benefit to slice the zucchini and let it drain a bit before spraying it with the non-stick.",
