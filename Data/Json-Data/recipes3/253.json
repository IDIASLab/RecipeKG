I added some salt and red chillie flakes to the eggs. second using 8 egg whites will result in a rather crisp sort of frittata which I didn't fancy so I used 8 whole eggs instead of 4 eggs and 8 egg whites. Third the cooking time is way off... 8-10 minutes on medium flame will result in a well burned bottom. I cooked on the stove about 5 minutes but it still burned pretty badly which is why I had to top with cheese to mask the burnt flavor that came through even after cutting a layer off. so overall it's ok but I dont think I will try this again...",
