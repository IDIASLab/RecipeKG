I used zesty chili tomatoes rather than \"rotel\" because it's too hot for my six year old. I used a 14 oz bag of chips rather than a 10 oz. I didn't use cream of celery either and can't imagine what that would have tasted like. I used cream of chicken though I expect that cream of mushroom would have been good -- even better would have been nacho cheese flavored soup or condensed cheddar. Next time I make this I think I'll cook an onion in with the chicken. I think I'll add a little sour cream to the soup mix for more zip. And I think I'll replace the Velveeta with real cheese -- colby/jack blend or something similar. That processed taste wasn't my favorite though my family loved it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

I like creamy so I wasn't afraid of that too much. In the end i think my family really liked it! Thanks!",
