(Not the recipe's fault, just that I always buy larger cans of sauce and smaller cans of tomatoes!)  I didn't have canned whole tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes.  I am sure this changed the recipe slightly, but it still turned out great, so don't hesitate to try this recipe if you have a different tomato type.  :)  My kids, who usually don't like zucchini, loved this and ate the zucchini!",
