It's almost exactly like the Gorgonzola Chicken dish that I get at my favorite restaurant.  DEFINTITELY use an extra 3/4 cup of cream or use less flour.  It doesn't need as much flour as it calls for unless you like a VERY THICK sauce.  Even with the extra cream it was thick, so keep that in mind!  I made this without the peppers, not a fan.  This would also work very well with chicken and penne instead of just a flat out \"macaroni and cheese\".  ",

Like previous reviewers have noted this sauce is very thick so either add more cream (or milk) to thin it out to desired consistency or cut back on the flour by 1/4-1/2 cup. I would also recommend chopping the bells peppers rather than slicing them...the slices were a bit big. I have another mac n' cheese recipe that I like more so I will likely return to that one. But this is a nice variation on your standard recipe.",

My neighbor absolutely adored it and took all of the leftovers home. If you are a blue cheese fiend you may like this otherwise the taste will be too strong.",
