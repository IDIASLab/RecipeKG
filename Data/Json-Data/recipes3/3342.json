The only difference in the way I prepare it is to press the thawed hash browns between sheets of paper towel pressing as much moisture out as possible. Then after putting in the pan and brushing with butter, it gets baked at 425 for 25 minutes. That makes a well browned crust instead of damp and mushy. Make the egg and milk mixture adding any combination of meats, chopped vegetables and cheese. Be sure to test the center of the quiche for doneness before removing from oven (a knife inserted in middle comes out clean). A great meal!",

Don't worry about crisping the bottom, it probably won't happen even if you bake it longer (which I did) and it doesn't matter.  An EXCELLENT way to make the filling is with diced pepperoni and cheddar (instead of the ham and swiss) with the additions of green pepper, onion, and some tomato if you wish. If you're worried about leakage through the crust, put a few slices on Buddig meat (ham, turkey, whatever) to coat the bottom before adding filling.  This went over BIG at Christmas brunch.  I'm telling you, you've got to try the pepperoni and cheddar combo!",

I had baked the quiche the night before since I was planning on getting home late from work and not having time to cook dinner. After about 2 minutes in the microwave it was ready to serve and got rave reviews from both my husband and our friends who wanted the recipe. Instead of using ham I substituted bacon and added chopped red pepper green pepper onion and mushrooms. I did not have any packaged frozen hash browns so I shredded two potatoes in my food processor. Like most of the reviewers I had trouble getting the potatoes to brown. I think next time I will cook the hash browns in a skillet with a little bit of oil as I would any hash browns and then transfer to the pan to top with ingredients and bake so that they have the crunch that I love in hash browns. This is a very versatile recipe I look forward to experimenting with it.",
