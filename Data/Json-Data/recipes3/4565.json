I adjusted this to make it more like a quiche because I didn't have all the meat and cheese called for--just had crumbled bacon and American Cheese so I wouldn't have had enough to do this as written with the mix poured on top. However having said that I think it would work well with sliced cooked bacon lining the dish as well--I might try that next time as that is something I'm more likely to have in the house as opposed to all those meats and cheeses. I added another egg and about a 1/2 cup water then mixed everything together. I did add frozen chopped spinach to the mixture and it baked up well--needed about 10 extra minutes to cook totally. It was eaten at a breakfast I brought it to but it did take longer to disappear than the other casserole I brought. To be fair we did have a lot of other food and maybe I scared people with the spinach.;) Thanks for the recipe!",
