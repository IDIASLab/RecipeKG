I didn't think the sour cream added much to it. I used a very high quality olive oil for this and I think that is a key. Daisies around here get gobbled up before they leave the yard so the lil yellow and white ones were out..but I still added some live big colored blossoms for the character. I also used cherry tomatoes out of preference.",
