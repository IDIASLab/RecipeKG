So I sauteed the leeks alone until soft then added the soup and 1 cup of chicken broth (because I didn't want to buy wine) then added the cornstarch and let thicken. Once the chicken was finished I shredded it transferred to a square 8 X 8 pyrex baking dish mixed with the leek/soup mixture then covered with a single sheet of puff pastry. It turned out very good just like chicken pot pie. Excellent comfort food.",

I suspect this would work well with many condensed soups based on your tastes. (I'm considering trying a different one next time just to see the variation in taste.)
