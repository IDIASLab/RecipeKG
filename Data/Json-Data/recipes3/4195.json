I used a jarred spaghetti sauce and added onions and sour cream to it. I put a bit of asiago cheese and chedder cheese at the bottom of each pepper which I cut into the boat style. And added mozzerella on top. I served it with a zuccini and summer squash in the side and a good bread. Yummy. Couldn't taste the all spice at all - should probably use more next time.",
