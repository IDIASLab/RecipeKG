RINSE THEM FIRST and the end product will be the same. \n2. Two vanilla beans is fine, but your desired flavor will develop over time. I just keep the beans in the liquid, using it as I go. \n3. Mix up your liquor selection! I LOVE making vanilla extract out of bourbon for a richer flavor--it's great for fall recipes (pumpkin pie, apple crisp, etc). \n4. This is a never-ending process. When your batch is at strength you like, decant most of the liquid into a separate bottle. Top off the original bottle with more liquor, and start the process over again. ",

I shook the bottle up everyday to thoroughly distribute the vanilla seeds, then after 30 days strained it all through a coffee filter, and bottled them!  It smells great and is a nice dark brown color.  I also did the same thing with a half-pint of rum for a vanilla-rum extract.  Wish I would have made more now.  With these changes, this is a 5-star recipe and great little Christmas gifts!  Thanks, Ginger.",

Her advice is to split the beans before putting them in the liquor to release the most flavor. A lot of people use vodka, mom has always used Brandy(J&B,not expensive)..the brandy gives a wonderful color and flavor. The vanilla really should be left alone for about 3 months(just give it a gentle shake every few weeks). This vanilla has always turned out very well,and is terrific to give as gifts.",
