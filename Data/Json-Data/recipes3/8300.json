It is important to note that using too much herbs de Provence may make the dish smell or taste too much like fancy soap, due to the lavender in herbs de Provence.

I also didn't have apricot jam, so I subbed peach for it. I did however have the fresh apricots. The one major thing I did that wasn't specified in the recipe was, after browning the chicken, there wasn't really any kind of liquid in the pan to deglaze with so, I added about 1/3 C of white wine to deglaze the pan and then added the preserves and apricots. Cooked on a very low heat so that the fruit would stay in tact and not burn or break down. Ended up using about 3 T. of the Herbe's de Provence rather than the 4 as stated in the recipe. I will make this again.",

I used an extra clove of garlic when sauteing the chicken (I also used bone in half chicken breasts).  Then after I removed the chicken, I scraped most of the browned garlic out of the pan thne I added cubed red potatoes another clove a garlic, a little more oil and herbs, salt, pepper.  After they browned a bit I added them to the chicken pan and put them in the over.  \n\nFor the glaze, I decided I wanted onions in it to give it a little more savory, so I caramelized thinly sliced sweet vidalia onions in the same chicken pan before adding the other ingredients.  Also, I didn't have enough apricot preserves (only 1/3 cup) so I added 1/3 cup of orange juice, along with the preserves and apricots.  It was WONDERFUL.   \n\nThe chicken was still juicy when it came out of the oven in about 30 mins (they were big halves) and the glaze was perfection!!  I can't wait to make this again!!!",

I rubbed it into the chicken, but didn't add any additional before baking.\n\nIt does need some liquid in the sauce, but instead of adding white wine like one reviewer, I just added a few tablespoons of water.  I also added an extra apricot or two.  The garlic, sweet apricots and spices make such a delicious combination.  I served it with rice and steamed vegetables.  It's definitely a keeper and I will make it whenever I have access to good fresh apricots.",

I followed the advice of another reviewer and used some sherry to deglaze the pan. I also added about a 1/4 of a thinly sliced onion with the garlic. I don't care for the taste of lavender so I followed a recipe by Emeril for making herbes de Provence. The chicken doesn't really release much juice while browning as instructed (I used thighs not drumsticks) but does while baking. So I added some of that juice back in at the final step and brought the sauce back to a boil. Served over rice it was wonderful. I do recommend using boneless chicken if possible as it was a bit messy to eat but worth it!",

Because there's no bone I didn't think there was the need to use the oven so I changed the steps slightly and used a Dutch oven on the stovetop to prepare the whole meal. I seasoned and browned the chicken as directed. Then put the lid on the Dutch oven and let everything cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes. When the chicken was cooked through I removed it to another plate and deglazed the pan with red wine. Then I added the apricots and orange marmalade (we didn't have apricot jam). I stirred this together added back the chicken and let it simmer about ten minutes before serving over rice. I had really really ripe apricots and they fell apart in the pan. I didn't mind this at all because it formed a thick rich sauce that was delicious. Even my picky 5-year-old loved this once we removed the apricots form his plate and got him to take a couple of bites. The flavor is sweet and salty with the lovely note of lavender in the background. I think this would work quite well with boneless pork chops too and that's probably what we'll try next time we want to take this recipe for a spin. But we will also keep the chicken in our repertoire. It was delicious!",
