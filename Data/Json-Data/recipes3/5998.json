My parents and girlfriend were also at the dinner party and safe to say, everyone enjoyed this dish.  Since then, my girlfriend has prepared the marinade for the peppers on numerous occasions for our bbq's this past summer.",

I cut the oil down to 3 T. and increased the basil and parsley. The only change I would make next time is to cut the oil further probably down to 2 tablespoons. I used these peppers in two different ways. Hubs grilled some spicy German sausages which I plated over a bed of saut\u00e9ed spinach and topped them with the marinated peppers. To use the leftover peppers I made them into bruschetta. I put a little olive oil on both sides of some baguette slices and toasted them under the broiler again on both sides. I drained the room temperature peppers well and tossed them with a shredded provolone/mozzarella blend. I topped the baguette slices with the pepper/cheese mixture and put a little extra cheese on top. Broiled for just a few minutes (watch them closely). YUM!! I ll be making this one again and soon!

I just made this recipe with dried parsley and oregano since I didn't have any fresh, I also sliced a red onion, brushed it with olive oil and grilled the slices in a grill pan, cut the slices in half and tossed with the peppers. I have tasted it already and cant wait till hubby gets home to serve dinner. Will be serving this tonight, cold, with grilled salmon and toasted homemade sourdough bread.
