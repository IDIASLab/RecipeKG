I start with a little oil adding some whole cumin and coriander seed to the oil and letting them pop before adding the potatoes - oil because the butter would burn on its own. (If you really want to be Indian throw in some black mustard seed and let it pop!) You could actually use just oil but I like the idea of some butter in there. Some green chili and a little fresh ginger and garlic in with the onions are also nice additions. I prefer the flavor of a nice garam masala to curry powder but it's all good. Try it with some tamarind or mango chutney!",
