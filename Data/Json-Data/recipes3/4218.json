The flavor was very good a great combination of flavors and not your regular pasta dish. However the flour measurement is way off. I think 1/4 of a cup is plenty if not too much. I definitely recommend adding in little by little until you get the consistancy desired. Overall very flavorful but wish I didn't use as much flour as called for. Thank you for sharing I will most likely make this again.",

I used EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) instead of vegetable oil as Mandy Sue recommended. I did not have green peppers so I omitted that ingredient. I combined the last two fresh garden tomatoes of the year with some diced canned tomatoes and accidentally put \"too much\" in so I doubled the other critical ingredients and ended up with way more than I needed. No problem we'll eat the rest later! This is a flexible recipe one that can be tweaked with spices volume and other ingredients.",
