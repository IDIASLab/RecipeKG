They contain copious amounts of raw superfoods, protein-rich spirulina, and raw Ecuadorian cacao. Think of them as a round granola bar: lots of packed energy, and easy to eat on the go. This is my go-to snack. For longer-term storage, keep in the freezer.",

I omitted cardamom because I didn't have it (and increased cinnamon to 1/2 tsp). I did have to substitute peanut butter for almond butter because I didn't have any so it was probably a bit sweeter than the original version. I used the full amount of spirulina and maca powder and you could definitely taste them but it was subtle.",
