I did try to dip this in Asian style sauces but it did NOT taste like a regular eggroll & the flavors were a little weird together. It basically tasted like an empanada. So I started dipping it in hot sauce - and THAT I really liked. I didn't add a lot of the soy/salt/pepper \"to taste\" b/c I worried they would end up too salty tasting in the Asian dipping sauce. (I used duck sauce.) So when I started using other sauces (particularly mustard & hot sauce) it left the insides a little bland. My family did eat these eggrolls but next time we will probably use about half the suggested beef & potato ingredients but leave the cabbage at 2 cups. My daughter (she's 3) liked them with ketchup. I can understand that because when you think about it ground beef = hamburger potatoes = french fries! We could definitely try this again b/c I did the prepping & eggrolling and dad did the frying so it was really more of a family meal than typical sit down dinners. I will add some different seasonings to the filling though...so the dipping sauce isn't such a requirement.",
