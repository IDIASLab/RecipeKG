The roasting gives the soup a much better flavor however you really need to add a lot more seasonings including salt which I normally don't cook with but in a soup you do need some. By the way \"Mom Of Three\" I got a charge out of reading a couple of your reviews. Darn no tomato juice in the house!!!!",

However this is one of those recipes that gets better as a leftover. I did add a LOT of salt (probably 2 tbsp) to it as I am a salt freak but I still thought it was bland the first night. Hubby and son liked it surprisingly as neither are chicken lovers. I heated it up 3 days later and it was really good. The flavors had really come together. Thanks Nikki I will use this again.",
