My two \"5-and-unders\" quickly polished them off and begged for more. I used a mixture of sour cream & cheddar with plain chips - very cheesy and delicious! The recipe says it makes 10 servings and maybe if you're serving them as appetizers that's true but if it's being served as a main dish don't plan on it feeding 10 people - they're just too good! I followed the advice of another reviewer and served this with buttered green beans (and carrots)-a perfect combo! THANK YOU! This treat will be returning to our table soon!",
