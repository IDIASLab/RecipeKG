I have to admit I didnt taste any at the party, but the next day I ate some leftovers and it was fantastic.  I made a few alterations; rotini instead of sea shell, yellow or red pepper in place of green, 3oz. can of olives, 3 green onions, and instead of the dressing provided in the recipe- I used Newman's Own Light Balsamic Vinegrette.  It was a huge hit.  The key was to mix everything together but the balsamic dressing and let it sit for a while.  In my case, 24 hours before I poured the Newman's Own on it.  Really yummy!  One reviewer suggested Pepperchini's, which I think would be a great addition.  I didnt think this cost much to make, and I dont understand why people think there is so much chopping.  That is a part of cooking!  This is an excellent recipe and one woman at our party said it was going to be her pasta salad recipe from now on. Excellent! (Edited 5/9/2010)",

                "reviewBody": "EXCELLENT!!  I would suggest not substituting the asiago cheese, it has such a distinct flavor and it adds so much to the flavor of the salad. I did use a three cheese vinigrette that contained the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, seasonings, and parmesan cheese. It made it so much easier,  and saves the cost of having to buy individual ingredients that you may not already have on hand. I did add additional salt and pepper, and a shake of red pepper for zest.  TIP: If you gently squeeze the tomatoe after slicing off top before chopping, it will remove the excess juice and seeds so that the salad doesn't get watered down as it sits.  This is one of the best pasta salads that I have ever made. I am so happy to be adding it to my collection.  Thanks so much for sharing.",

Per the suggestion of a couple other reviewers, I used a little less oil, but I think I will use all of it next time.  I liked the asiago cheese, but I think next time I will try real mozzarella instead.    I will certainly make this again.",

The antipasto does hold up well for left overs. This dish is perfect to bring to parties & picnics but be prepared to drop some cash.

                "reviewBody": "UPDATE: I DECIDED TO GIVE THIS A SECOND GO ALMOST 5 YEARS AFTER I INTIALLY IT.:) IT WAS MUCH BETTER THIS TIME AROUND. HERE'S WHAT I DID: A) USED CHEESE-FILLED TORTELLINI (I THINK I'LL GO BACK TO USING ROTINI THO...) B) OMMITTED THE FRESH PEPPERS FOR CHOPPED ROASTED RED PEPPERS C) ADDED HALF OF A THINLY SLICED RED ONION D) USED ASIAGO THIS TIME AND E) SUBBED A MARINATED GREEN OLIVE & ARTICHOKE DELI SALAD FOR THE BLACK OLIVES CALLED FOR. ALTHOUGH MORE EXPENSIVE IT WAS DIVINE!!! This was \"OK.\" Although my friend liked this more than I did she wasn't all that impressed either. NOTE: This makes a LOT (I halved everything and still ended up with a TON!) and unfortunately doesn't lend itself well to leftovers (my salad dried up quickly - despite covering my bowl I needed to add additional vinaigrette the next day). This is also very expensive to prepare (the meat and cheese are pricey) but for a special splurge I think the 's spent are well worth it. To speed pre I subbed small grape tomatoes for whole ones. I also omitted the red bell pepper and subbed tri-colored rotini pasta for shells (both personal preferences). Because Asiago cheese was so pricey I opted for a less expensive (fresh) mozzarella instead. I found that using a GOOD quality olive oil and balsamic for the vinaigrette REALLY makes all the difference so PLEASE don't skimp on those. All in all this was decent but I will need to make several changes if I were to make it again. Thanks anyways Dayna!:-)",
