I sauted the thinly sliced yellow squash with a chopped large onion and garlic till softened, I added cumin, cilantro, smoked paprika. I used a 7 oz can of green chilies, used only 1/2 of the cheese. I added a sliced garden tomato on top of the filling, before the extra chip topping. I served this with a fresh garden salsa, green beans and cucumber-tomato salad (most of our dinner came from our garden!) I made two 9\" pies, and baked them for 30 minutes. I LOVE that I can use the broken tortilla chips in the bottom of the bag instead of making a bottom crust! Wish I'D thought of that, and will use the idea for other savory pies!",
