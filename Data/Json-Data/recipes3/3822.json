I was pleasantly surprised by the way this turned out!  I didn't think it was too sweet, probably I used a bit less ketchup than what the recipe called for.  I also used fresh red onions & Parmesan cheese, since that's what I had on hand.  I didn't have bell peppers but next time I think peas would be a good addition.I know I used more than 1 cup of macaroni, but I just eyeballed it so I don't have the exact measurement.  I will definitely make this again!",

WOW! but a little too much for me!) I diced some onion and sauted it with the beef. I'll make this again for busy evenings on the go and perhaps I'll take the tomato soup suggestion just to see if it improves even more! Thanks Eileen!",
