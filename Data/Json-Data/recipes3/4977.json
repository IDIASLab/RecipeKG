I used a mix of romaine and iceberg lettuce and opted out of the cabbage. I added some tomato and used a Mexican blend cheese. Instead of bottled ranch dressing I used \"Ranch-Style Buttermilk\" dressing from this site and \"Tortilla Snack Strips\". Overall very tasty!",

To make it quick and easy I used pre-cooked chicken strips and then just browned them up in a cast-iron skillet with some fajita seasoning (gave the chicken a fabulous crust!). Then I mixed all the salad ingredients in a bowl using romaine lettuce arugula and some baby lettuces and added corn red bell pepper grape tomatoes red cabbage shallots (since I didn't have any red onion) and some light tortilla chips. I plated this mix and topped it with the black beans chicken and cheese. Then I mixed together some homemade salsa and light ranch dressing and lightly drizzled this over the top for a spicy mexi-ranch style dressing. My husband and I thought this made a wonderful quick and tasty dinner!",

For dressing I elected to use a good quality Caesar Dressing to which I add a bit of taco seasoning and lots of cumin to taste. I like the extra zip this dressing gives to the salad.",
