I put it in directly with the pasta(as listed in the directions), and for the first 5 mins had pasta soup.  It eventually thickened up, and had great consistency.\n   On the \"taste\" end of things, I thought the sauce was awesome.  I'm being serious.  Now, I'm a big fan of the Alfredo from Olive Garden, and anyone who eats there regularly will know what I'm talking about.  I'll have to say, this version is second to Olive Garden's.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  \n   Anyone who loves some good ol' Alfredo, definately try this one out.  Also, I added extra parmesan to the sauce.  It was magnifico!",

There were 2 1/2 servings at best. Next time I will triple or quadruple this. I reduced the salt by half and it was ever so slightly salt top-heavy probably because the butter I used was salted. But that is a minor easily corrected issue. And it's a common reason why recipes come out too salty. As another reviewer recommended another reason that it might be too salty for some is if one uses the off the shelf parmesan cheese. Since it's such a major ingredient spring for the fresh stuff. I used freshly grated asiago cheese and it was spectacular. I thawed and microwaved a couple of chicken breast cutlets. Slicing the chicken in long pieces makes for a nice appearance if one places the cutlet on the pasta in it's original shape--not to mention a great recipe enhancer making the pasta a full-on meal. Pasta chicken sauce in that order. What a meal!",

Thank you. Given this SAUCE tossed over pasta you can decide about your accompaniments (chicken beef seafood vegetables etc.). Add whatever you like (cooked onions peppers peas corn carrots zucchini; cooked beef poultry seafood or whatever) to your PASTA. If you feel like it add (fresh is preferred but dried is OK too) Tarragon Dill Marjoram Basil Oregano or Cilantro. Got a man (or older boy teen) in your home? Think about incorporating bacon and/or one or more \"shakes\" (approximately 1 T.) of Worcester Sauce and/or Hot Sauce and/or prepared Horseradish) into the SAUCE. Use ANY pasta of your choice. IMO the \"thicker ones\" (e.g. rigatoni rotini gremeli penne etc.) are preferred (they're more prone to absorbing the SAUCE as well as the flavor(s)). Use THIS SAUCE and your own preferred \"accompaniments\". It's unlikely you'll go wrong! We use SALTED butter in my home. Therefore I do not add salt during preparation of ANY dish I prepare (the shaker is on the table at all times but no one seems to notice). At the same time this recipe seems to \"work better\" when UNSALTED/SWEET butter is used. My advice: start with this SAUCE (it's really good) and \"run with\" the rest of your mral.",
