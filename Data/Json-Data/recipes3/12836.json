It certainly is easy and quick with no rising time involved but it was a bit of a disappointment to me. Honestly I ve never had brown soda bread before and I m giving this recipe an additional star based solely on that but I simply wasn t crazy about either the taste or the texture. Wish I could give a better review and I don't want to discourage others from trying this recipe but doubtful I ll make this one again.",
