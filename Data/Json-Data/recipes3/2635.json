If I could re-write this I would call it \"Stuffed Cajun Sea Chicken\" but I want to give credit where credit is due and that is to the idea itself as with many recipes that are like an artist's canvas. I did make numerous changes. I used fresh crab instead of canned. I added garlic to both sauce and stuffing. I used seasoned bread crumbs. I added minced onion and fresh minced mushrooms to sauce and fresh sliced mushrooms in stuffing which i sauted with the onions and butter. I used Wondra instead of flour. I used Old bay instead of paprika and I used creole seaoning in sauce as well as sprinkled on top before serving. I cut split in side of breast and stuffed instead of pounding and rolling and I cooked for 45 minutes and then an additional 10 uncovered with cheese on top.",

They looked good enough for company & tasted even more impressive. I served them w/ boiled baby yukon potatoes & a fresh salad.",

Hubs on the other hand said it was darn near a five star dish. The chicken breasts I used were small so I just pounded them out a bit spread a double amount of the crab mixture over them and didn't bother to roll them up. I seasoned the chicken first with salt and pepper. I added some extra melted butter and shredded Swiss to the crab mixture as well as a few tablespoons of finely chopped green and orange bell pepper. I also used fresh mushrooms chopped rather than the canned. I skipped the step of heating the mixture through--its stint in the oven takes care of that. To the white sauce I added some white wine then followed the baking directions as written and came up with beautifully cooked moist and tender chicken--didn't even need a knife. While I found this short on flavor hubs said he appreciated the subtleness of flavor. Very reminiscent of Chicken a la King. With our different taste buds and assessments I arrived at a compromise of four stars.",
