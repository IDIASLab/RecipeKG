I needed to whip something up fast and this was great. I had IQF chicken breasts which were very large cut them in 1/2 used alot of garlic and reg.onion(no shallots on hand). Sauteed onions and garlic browned chicken in pan removed chicken to a plate and made the sauce in the pan using tblsp. of italian seasoning and 1 tsp. oregano. returned chicken to pan and simmered a bit more added more than 2 tblsp. of cheese.
