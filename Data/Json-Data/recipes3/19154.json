I have made it both ways and I think that the crust is firmer and crisper  with a whole cup of butter/margarine.    Many recipes call for the butter/margarine to be cut up on the top of the cake mix.   I have melted the butter and I have patted it on and I can't  tell the difference.   So now I just melt the butter because it is easier.   I do make one major substitution.    I switched to white cake mix.   I don't know what is put in cake mix to make it yellow but to me it gives the final product a little bit of a cotton candy taste which is still amazingly good don't get me wrong.  I just prefer the lighter taste of the white mix.   A classic upside down cake uses white cake,  and Dump Cake is  like a Right Side Up / Upside Down cake as strange as that sounds.    It is rich and to quote Steel Magnolia's,  \"I serve it with ice cream to cut the sweetness.\"",
