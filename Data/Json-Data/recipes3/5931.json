The reason I didn't give it 5 stars though is because it is EXTREMELY spicy. My husband and I had to add 2 or 3 dollops of sour cream to our bowls because it was just too much. I think the tbsp. of pepper is a mis-print because my mom said in all her 50 years of cooking she has never seen a recipe that calls for that much pepper! Next time I make this I will SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the amount of pepper and probably the chili powder as well.",

I used dark kidney beans and added a garlic clove and also used low-sodium vegetable broth (again eyeballed it) instead of the liquid from the beans to cut down on the sodium. Other than those changes I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out fantastic and I would recommend this recipe for anyone who wants chicken chili but not \"white chili.\"",
