First, I steamed the green peppers instead of boiling them - easier to handle and that way they didn't get soggy. Then  I used the \"Creole Seasonings Blend\" recipe from this site (and less of it - apprx 1/2 tbls) and right before I stuffed the peppers, I added about 8 oz sharp cheddar cheese: mixed it into the rice & sausage concoction to melt. Finally, I sprinkled a DASH of brown sugar over all and opened another 8oz can of tomato sauce and poured over the top of that. Baked and viola!  We loved these! It had kick but it wasn't hot.  Great blend of flavors! My whole family thanks you Heidi!!",

First of all, 2-1/2 cups chicken broth made the stuffing mixture way too soupy.  I felt like if I let it \"cook until thick\"  the shrimp would be overcooked and the rice too done,  So, I ended up using a slotted spoon to drain off liquid as I stuffed the peppers.  I also used less Creole seasoning (I used 2 teaspoons) because I felt like it would be too salty otherwise.  I'm glad I made that decision as the final mixture bordered on being a little salty.  All in all, though, this was super tasty!",
