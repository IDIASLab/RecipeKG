My changes: Doubled recipe added dried red/green bell peppers and onions (from Penzey's) increased garlic powder to 1/2 tsp used 19.5 oz. pkg sweet italian turkey sausage and used reduced-fat cheddar. Made casserole night before; let it sit out 30 minutes next morning before cooking. Took about 55 minutes to cook. Recommend adding ingredients to saucepan rather than 13X9 pan--too messy. Used non-stick spray on pan--came out easily and made clean-up quick.",

EVERYONE  loved the casserole & begged for the recipe. Two changes that I made to the written instructions were that I mixed the egg/cheese mixture and the sausage with the grits before I transferred everything into the 9x13 baking dish and the second change I made was that I added 1 cup of cheese to the top of the casserole instead of the recommended 1/2 cup. Other than that, I followed the recipe as it was written. [NOTE: I would recommend that you use the packaged, shredded cheddar cheese rather than grating your own block cheddar. The packaged cheese is \"drier\" and doesn't have the excess cheese oil/grease; therefore, it doesn't add an unwelcomed layer of grease to the top of the casserole.] This is a WONDERFUL recipe that will now become a family tradition!!",

My sister made a recipe just like this one year for Christmas and I loved it and was shocked it was loaded with grits...to my amazement I have looked for similar recipes as the one she made and yet to find the exact one. This one was okay slightly bland but have more of a feeling it was the sausage and it was a bit soupy not soupy running but like a soft yet thick pudding. If that makes sense. My sister's was a bit thicker and stood it's shape some. Possibly she used more eggs but while this was simple it was really nice some tweaks are needed on our end with taste preferences. But again has a nice flavor.",
