I also added one each of: sweet potato, white potato,1/2 cup of pumpkin puree,extra carrots, used olive oil instead of butter, and veggie broth instead of beef. Was excellent, and my new favorite for veggie soup. I also cooked some small pasta shapes (animals,stars,tubes,letters,etc.) separately and added them to the bowls and ladled the soup on top. with leftovers i kept the pasta separate so it wouldnt be mushy.

I did reduce the soy sauce to 2 tablespoons, because 3 seemed a little much to me (I was glad I did) and used diced tomatoes in place of the whole (made more sense). Also, I just used salt to taste and not the entire teaspoon called for. I added in one diced zucchini and a few diced potatoes because they needed to be used up. When it was almost done, I added about 1 cup of small shell pasta and simmered until done, just to make it a little more hearitier. This made a really nice sized pot of soup. Two thumbs up from all of us and a definate repeat recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)",
