Next time I will try leaving the skin on the apples for additional nutrition & color. I agree with OneSpunCookie that this would make an excellent warm dip. I served it over brown rice. Before I popped it in the oven I thought it might be too dry to serve over rice but the apples release a lot of moisture. Thank you so much for posting!",

We paired it with toasted baguette after reading several reviews suggesting that it would make a good dip although the baguette definitely wasn't necessary. We chopped the casserole up for our 10 month old too and he loved it. Definitely recommend cooking the onion and kale ahead of time--it would never fit in a baking dish otherwise. I sauteed the onion and kale together using a tablespoon of olive oil then mixed everything and baked as the recipe calls for.",

I used plain Greek yogurt and shredded mozzarella. This dish was a hit with my family and the perfect combination of flavors to go with our pork & kraut. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because even though I used 3 apples (2 red 1 green) the general consensus at my table was that it could use even more apples. Also I cooked it at 400 because I had scalloped potatoes in at the same time. Even with the increased temp it needed over an hour to reach a bubbling point. Otherwise it was delish and will definitely be made again.",
