                "reviewBody": "Very good recipe. I modified it slightly to slowly cook the onions and celery (of which I used two stalks) in 1/4 cup of butter in a sautee pan for about 15 minutes. This softened the onions and helped them more readily dissolve into the stuffing. I also added all the herbs and seasonings to the onion mixture and let it sit for about an hour before continuing the prep. When it came time to put everyting together, I then mixed the onion/celery mixture into the breadcrumbs (I used corn bread) and spread it onto the baking dish.\n\nA few other recommendations for improvement beyond this: Take out the chicken at the 1.5 hour mark, then spread out the stuffing onto a shallow baking dish and continue to cook for about 15 more minutes. I found the stuffing a touch too moist and this would dry it out just enough. Also, if you sautee the onions/celery first, you definitely DO NOT need the extra butter drizzled on top. Also, only 1/2 a can of chicken stock is necessary to achieve the right moisture level (I think next time I'd even cut the applesauce down by 1/3 to keep it from becoming too wet).\n\nAll that said, however, it is a great recipe!",
