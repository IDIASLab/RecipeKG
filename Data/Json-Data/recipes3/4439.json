After adding the bacon to the cooked vegetables, I poured eight beaten eggs over the top, covered and cooked on medium-low about 10 minutes until almost firm. Then I topped with sliced tomatoes and grated cheese, and continued to cook, uncovered, until the cheese was melted. Had enough leftovers to serve the next day rolled up in flour tortillas!",

I figure it is one of those kitchen sink dishes as you can thrown in just about anything you would eat with eggs. I didn't have peppers on hand so left them out used cheddar rather than american cheese. But you don't really have to make anything else with this meal. I did adjust the amount for only 2 people. Also I didn't read the recipe correctly and didn't boil the potatoes before putting in the skillet. That may but it still only took my a little over an hour to make.",

Covered with a paper towel and cooked for 4 mins. I then cubed potatoes and added papirika, salt and pepper to taste. I fried them in my skillet for approx. 3 mins then added crumbled sausage and cooked them with the potatoes. I drained the excess oil. For quickness I also used frozen stir fry green, red peppers with onions. I added these to my skillet with the potatoes and sausage about 5 minutes prior to serving. My cooking and prep time was less than 20 mins. I added scrambled eggs (which I made in a seperate skillet) and Mexican shredded cheese on top. My husband likes spicy and added hot sauce and jalepeno's on top of his, while my kids use ketchup on everything this was no exception even though it didn't need it. I did make alot of changes but this recipe was a great base and it turned out excellent. ",
