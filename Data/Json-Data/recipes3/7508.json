Also, if you don't drain the fat from the meat and use that instead of adding butter to the batter you will get a more meaty flavor.  I sauteed my veggies til they were almost soft, then browned the meat in my cast iron frying pan, then popped the pan into the oven until it was good and hot before I added the batter.  My Yorkie rose so high it almost crawled out of the pan!",

                "reviewBody": "Well first of all, it tasted great, but I did things a little different. First of all I cooked the beef first because usually when you make yorkshire you are supposed to bake right away, never set aside batter! I sauteed beef, onions, celery, and carrots. Added to it about 2 tbsp each HP sauce and Tony Romas Bold n spicy bbq sauce, Also about 1 tbsp beef oxo. When ready I whipped together the yorkshire mix, with a wisk (not a mixer) and layered the beef and pudding mix in a large rectangle pyrex, this way the yorkshire isn't burning on top and runny in the middle, or sunken into the beef. It actually nicely coated around the beef mix like a quiche almost, and the top had about 10 little peaks of golden brown yorkshire. Something is still off a bit, and there should be more rising done, but overall, the family was satisfied with the taste and texture, done this way. Next time I think I'll add corn too, it is kind of like sheperds pie when you have no potatoes in the house!",

I saute'ed the onion and garlic then added ground beef and browned the meat then added Worcestershire sauce and Steak sauce also salt and pepper. I then added tomatoes carrots and celery and beef broth and then simmered until all the liquid had reduced down. I then prepared the Yorkshire pudding mixture according to the recipe. Then I put the meat mixture in a metal baking pan that had been heated in the oven before. I packed the meat tightly together and flattened it then poured Yorkshire pudding mixture on top and baked for 55 minutes in oven. The Yorkshire pudding rose but did fall down when it came out of the oven but it was still delicious.",

Firstly no raising agent is used in real Yorkies, all purpose flour, yes, but only one egg with one cup.  finally the oven needs to be stupidly hot, at least 200, this is why some reviews are upset by lack of rise, 175 will never make good puffy Yorkshire puddings.",
