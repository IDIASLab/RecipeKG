I followed it to a T and it wasn't all that creamy but used unsalted butter and condensed cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic added pepper but no salt. It was just so darn delicious the onions were melting in my mouth they were so tender. I can say it wasn't that \"creamy creamy\" like I thought it would be but it was still excellent. So I added a dollup of sour cream which added the creaminess to the soup...All in all and excellent filling soup and wished I had thought about adding some portabella mushrooms to it. Thanks wmat this is a total keeper.",
