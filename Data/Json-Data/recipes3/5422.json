It's is grand with those two items. By the way never ever used instant potatoes when making this stuffing. Homemade whipped potatoes make it so much more fluffy whereas instant make it watery and less flavorful. Great grandma and throughout generation we always used homemade whipped potatoes. Don't know where people get the idea to use instant as that is not the authentic recipe. Don't cut corners when it comes to this recipe. We also added slightly sauteed celery. 1 Cup. Who ever puts fruits vegetables etc is destroying this recipe. Stick to the authentic. Yuck who would add fruit such as lemon and instant potatoes. Disgusting. Not stuffing it in the turkey. Just put it in a buttered casserole dish and bake it at 325 for 20-30 minutes.",
