(which is the healthiest for you) The way we prepare our venison and elk steaks is the way we would do a beef steak We spead it with olive oil using a pastry brush shake on our seasonings let set about ten minutes place them on the preheated grill seasoned side down brush top side with olive oil and shake on seasonings. Only grill each side for 5 - 8 minutes You never want to overcook wild game. It comes out delicious this way and very moist (unless you overcook it) Wild game has not got a lot of fat it is very lean and very healthy because of that. Some people feel that because it is wild it needs to be cooked a long time not true! Rare to med rare is the best for wild game.",

I don't usually measure unless I'm baking but opted to do so with this recipe as it was my first time cooking venison and I didn't want to screw this up. I made a salt water brine and soaked my venison steaks for 4 hours prior to preparing them. I had 4 steaks and barely had enough of the breading mixture for all 4 so there wasn't any left for the gravy. Cooked these in my electric skillet at 325 degrees 4 minutes per side and didn't crowd the skillet (that lowers the oil's temperature and affects your final outcome) I've never caramelized onions in hot oil so I skipped that part. I caramelize using the low and slow method. I opted to make a simple bechamel sauce since I had no bread crumbs left. This was loved by the whole family and I tell you....I don't want another plain ol' chicken fried steak. I want mine to be made with venison from now on. Thanks so much for this recipe and for showing my husband that deer meat can be delicious when cooked properly.",
