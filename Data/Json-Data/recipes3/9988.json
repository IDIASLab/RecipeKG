Added nice color, too. When I put the chicken in the pan, I sprinkled seasoned salt on each piece....along with garlic powder. When I added the garlic to the sauce, I also added 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese & onion powder (1 1/2 tsp) & seasoned salt to the sauce & stirred until it was well blended. Then, I put the chicken (already covered in sauce) to the side, & dumped the rest of everything into a 9x13 glass dish. I pressed the pieces of chicken all along the top, so we could find them, lol. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese, then topped with breadcrumbs....drizzling 1/4 cup of melted butter (the MELTED butter measured out to 1/4 cup...). Then baked for about 25 minutes @ 350*. AWESOME!!!!",
