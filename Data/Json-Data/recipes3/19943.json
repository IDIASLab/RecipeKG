I used a 4 lb. bag of frozen meatballs a 32 oz. jar of grape jam a 12 oz. jar of chili sauce and 2 Tbsp. mustard. It helps a great deal to warm the sauce mixture in a saucepan and whisk it up so the jelly breaks down and it's nicely combined before pouring over the meatballs. I started this with frozen meatballs with the crockpot on low and they were perfect in 4 hours. Kept them on low throughout the party. UPDATE: Made again with a big package (Costco) of Aidells Chicken and Pineapple Terriyaki meatballs and it was better.",

But I was having 60 people for my son's first birthday and needed something easy that I could make in advance so I tried it. I used frozen cocktail meatballs (3 lb bag). They were gone after about 10 minutes and everyone was asking for more (in spite of there being plenty of everything else on the table) They were FANTASTIC. I wish I'd made twice as many. The only changes I made were to use a whole jar of each grape jelly and chili sauce a tablespoon or so of dijon and about the same of worcester sauce. I dumped everything in the crockpot and left in on low for about 4 hours. AMAZING. Easy and a huge crowd pleaser! I will make again for New Year's! Thanks for the great recipe!",

I made my own italian meatballs and used one jar of Heinz chili sauce and one jar of Smuckers grape jelly with 2 tab. of Nance's Sharp and Creamy mustard. I cooked the sauce ingredients on the stove top until well blended and bubbly and then put the meatballs after they were cooked in the oven into my crockpot and poured the sauce on top and let them cook on low for 3 hrs. Perfect. They were tasty and moist. You just have to remember to give them a stir into the sauce every once in a while if they're not already gone by then.",

We had a package of frozen meatballs in the freezer that we didn't like (a different brand than we normally buy) and I decided I would use them up at an upcoming potluck so I came here to look for ideas. When I came across this recipe I read it aloud to my husband and he kept saying \"grape jelly?\" We were very curious so he asked me to make them a head of time. He couldn't believe I used the same meatballs that he didn't like previously when I used them with speghetti. Anyway - other than using frozen meatballs I followed the recipe exact and I highly recommend. Thank you!",

How can these two ingredients taste so good together? I've been making them ever since but like most reviewers I also use frozen meatballs in the crockpot and always heat the jelly and chili sauce first in a small saucepan to avoid jelly globs. I add a few splashes of worchestershire 3/4 tsp ground mustard garlic/onion powders to taste and even a little minced garlic. After thoroughly heated I pour the sauce over the meatballs stir well to evenly coat and keep the crockpot on low for a few hours. I made these today as part of our annual New Year's Day appetizer spread and my husband picky 3 1/2 year-old daughter and I were gobbling these up like there was no tomorrow! Fantastically easy delicious and always a crowd-pleaser I will be making these for years to come. This sauce also pairs well with 'Lil Smokies too!",
