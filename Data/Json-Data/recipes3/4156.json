I didn't change the recipe very much except to insert a couple of cardamom seeds into the slits with the orange peel and also I mixed a little orange juice into the dry ingredients before rubbing it into the lamb - it did marvellous things to the gravy. Also instead of using powdered cardomom I shelled whole cardomom and used the seeds - much more aromatic. Will do this again and again!",

I added dried thyme to the spice rub on top and stuff the lamb with fresh thyme sprigs. I love cardamom and wished I had tasted that more so next time I make this I will take the advice of a fellow reviewer and stuff the slits with whole cardamom seed. I also didn't taste much of the orange flavor surprisingly unless I was biting into an actual orange peel so I will also top the lamb with some orange juice like the reviewer did. I also agree with another reviewer - it is definitely done at about 140 degrees. 175 would have been way too overcooked. Once the lamb is removed from the heat keep in mind the temperature still rises a bit. To give it a little extra crispy crust (because I love crispy outside and tender inside) I broiled the lamb on high for no more than a minute. Hmmm! Perfect finish",
