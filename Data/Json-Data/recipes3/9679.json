I ended up having to add more beef broth and it was still too thick.   The submitter just said to add two red onions and doesn't give measurements, so, maybe my onions were larger.  We also thought the sauce was very heavy and seemed overwhelming for the steak.   I think using a cup of cream was just too much.  I will not be making this again.",

I'd make it again as an alternative to beef stroganov.",
