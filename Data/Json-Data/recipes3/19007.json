Made exactly as written almost; subbed a round loaf of Hawaiian bread for the Challah ( it was cheaper than brioche and challah and listed as possible sub in my challah research). Subbed a little milk with cream too. Put together the day before and refrigerated until ready to bake next day. Turned broiler on last 3 min at end to crisp the cheese a bit. Sooo good! The goat cheese is not overpowering said those who do not normally like goat cheese. Will make again soon for a ladies' party.",
