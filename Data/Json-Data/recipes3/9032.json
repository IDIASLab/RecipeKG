I also broiled them as I do with many grilled recipes in the winter. I thought the egg would help with moisture but it didn't. It slightly reminded me more of a meatloaf. So to improve on the flavor I topped them with a bbq ketchup type sauce and heated them briefly and it made them taste better. Not a repeat recipe but it made for a filling dinner tonight anyhow.",
