Baked them in the oven and then placed them into spaghetti sauce. Flavor was a bit bland so will add more seasoning and cheese. I used a 1/4 measuring cup to be sure meatballs were same size but I think I will make them a bit small next time. Sixteen year old liked them along with my husband but my nine year old ate the spaghetti but not the meatballs.",

I read the other reviews about them being dry so about halfway through the baking time I drizzled them with olive oil. I didn't have \"italian\" breadcrumbs so I just used plain and added some herbs (to be honest I don't really pay attention when I'm sprinkling I just start with oregano and go until it smells right). The flavor is awesome but there is a \"springiness\" to their texture that is a little strange. After mixing everything it was so liquid-y there was no way that I could have shaped this into balls so I added another 1/2 cup or so of breadcrumbs. In the future I will use 2 eggs and a little olive oil for a half batch. I think the oil should help with the moistness issue. I recommend trying these.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a creative approach to a vegetarian version of meatballs. This can be described as springy type of bread ball. A couple things I did differently though. The amount of parmesan cheese was doubled. A tablespoon of both ketchup and Worcestershire sauce were added to create more moisture. Instead of one clove of garlic a teaspoon of garlic powder was added so its flavors can be distributed more evenly. Salt was slightly increased and added tsp of oregano to create a bolder flavor. Since these are a bit dry I would recommend adding a sauce factor. For example place them on bare pasta noodles and pour the sauce on top. Some even mentioned baking with a sauce. Because of the dry texture I would make the meatball portions a little bit smaller. This is certainly a very unique vegetarian recipe.",
