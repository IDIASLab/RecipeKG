I had not used the spice in/on any recipe so I was excited to find it in this recipe. I really liked the taste of the egg salad. It held up nicely for lunches without getting watery. That is always a plus in my book. I will certainly be making this one again. Thanks CAMILLEELISE for sharing your recipe.",

This caught my eye while searching for something to do with tahini (besides the obvious hummus) and I had all the ingredients on hand. The tahini and zaatar go extremely well together and pair wonderfully with the eggs. The yogurt I had is fat-free Greek so it made the spread a bit thicker and I needed to add a bit more other then that I stuck to the recipe. I suggest not leaving out the pickle the acid really balances it out. This is a lovely recipe for a sandwich a big dolop on a lettuce salad or in a tomato cup. I'm going to try replacing egg with chicken I suspect that would be lovely as well.",
