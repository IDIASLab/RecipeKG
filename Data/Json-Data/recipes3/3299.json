If you enjoy the flavor of onions I recommend adding onion powder instead of the pearl onions I tried. They did not blend in with the dish and the texture was not something I enjoyed. I will probably not be making this again.",

I poached my chicken with Bell's poultry seasoning- that's the key- added a little more milk (1/2cup total) and a second can of cream of potato soup. I've tried this with frozen mixed veg and with Veg-All brand canned mixed vegetables and the Veg-All is the way to go! This meal is completed in our house with some cranberry sauce....DELICIOUS!!!!!!! EASY!!!!!!! WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing!",

I also don't care to read that someone liked it but made a few changes.  Or in other words they made an entirely different dish with their 'few' changes.  If you think this is too high in sodium you can use low sodium soups and leave out the salt.  If you're not comfortable with that make something else for dinner.",
