With that being said I would give this recipe 4 stars based on the written recipe. 4 stars because it was quick healthy and the ingredients are something that I usually always have on hand which is always a plus for any recipe. Once it was done I thought it needed to be tweaked a bit so I added red pepper flakes pepper & Italian seasoning to the mix. These additions helped it to not be so bland. I served the mixture over a bed of fresh spinach and added a pinch of parmeasean cheese on top and wellah... turned this recipe into 5 stars! Too bad the battery on my camera was dead because this looked really fancy on my plate. Next time I think I'll add fresh mushrooms - and trust me - there will be a next time for making this recipe.
