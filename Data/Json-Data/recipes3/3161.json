I had to add 3 cups of broth to get it to the consistency of a soup and that's in addition to the liquid I used from the can of tomatoes. I also didn't see a reason for the extra pan so I browned everything in a stock pot drained the fat then proceeded with adding the vegetables. It tasted even better the next day. It's also very filling!",
