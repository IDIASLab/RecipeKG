I had some mexican squash in the fridge and used those as well. My family was hesitant at first (who ever heard of fried cucumbers, after all)With some ranch dressing or try some ketchup with a bit of hot sauce mixed in. Could not keep up with demand!! Thanks for the recipe.  ",

I'd rather bake at 375 for 15-20 minutes than fry and serve with salsa. Great idea and inspiration!",

I dipped the sliced & peeled cucumbers in an egg then dipped them in a mixture of flour breadcrumbs parsley paprika garlic powder and salt. Fried them in a skillet in vegetable oil. They are a pretty finicky veggie to fry. Make sure you don't overcook. The thinner the slice the crunchier (and less soggy/mushy) the end product. I recommend changing the oil throughout the process the ones that tasted the best were the ones that were done in fresh oil (not the oil that i had already fried 10 cucumber slices in). Next time I will add Parmesan cheese to the mixture I think it would make it a lot better.",

I never fry anything and I never use cornmeal so I think it was just my taste and inexperience. I will try again using some of the ideas from other posters and hopefully it will be as I hoped.\n\nupdate: So tonight I gave this another try but changed it a bit. I sprinkled garlic powder on the cucumbers then coated it in corn meal, then dipped in water and then bread crumbs. I then sprinkled with salt and pepper and baked for about 20-25 minutes on 375! they came out sooooo much better. More flavor and crispy instead of soggy. This way is worth 5 stars I think!",
