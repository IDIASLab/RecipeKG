I used fresh (crimini)mushrooms cause I don't believe in using canned shrooms (the flavor just isn't the same). I also added some fresh chopped spinach. I made the mistake of not crushing the cornflakes but I added double the amount asked for instead and the stuffing still came out fantastic! 5 min before the cooking time had finished I topped the stuffing with some extra crushed cornflakes to give it a crunchy top. GREAT! Thanks for the recipe",
