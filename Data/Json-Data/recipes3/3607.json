                "reviewBody": "I have been making this for years and love it! There are a variety of ways to use it and to mix it up a bit as well. I use fresh tomatoes when in season and add canned chopped green chilies (you may need to drain some of the tomato juices if it is going to be too thin). You have to be careful with green chilies if you are heat sensitive, I am not. But if you are, start with approximately 1 heaping T. chilies to 3 large fresh tomatoes (or 1 16 oz can). I also use fresh basil and thyme (2 large basil leaves and large sprig of thyme, leave it whole, cook, then remove prior to eating or chop and leave in the dish). When using the herbs, it is okay to omit the chilies, but I use the herbs with the chilies and love this flavor combination. This also makes a good pasta sauce (leave all your tomato juices in), top it with fresh parmesan cheese...love it! Sometimes I omit the green chilies and add black olives when using it as a pasta sauce, delicious too. Use your imagination, this dish can be varied to suit your taste. To novice cooks: I grow my own herbs, so I am always experimenting. I live in an apartment and grow them and veggies on my deck in the summer. In the winter I have a small herb garden in front of my sliding door. Herbs are easy, easy to grow! You can have a small herb garden in any window in your home year round. It is far less expensive than buying them in the grocery store and SO much better than the dried herbs!",

If you want to send it off the scale great and still be fairly healthy try this: when the dish is completed sprinkle some butter buds over the top add a small amount of grated cheddar (2% lowers the calories) and sprinkle some italian seasoned bread crumbs over it all. It takes a small amount so you aren't adding too many calories or fat. For about a 2 person sized helping I added about a tablespoon each of cheese and bread crumbs - I estimate it added about a 100 calories. As low cal as this dish already is you can afford it. Now it tastes like you are eating a decadent squash casserole:-) I could eat this every week!",
