I've made this substituting potatoes for beans, okra for zuchini, pintos for northern beans, adding rice, etc.  It always turns out delicious and satisfying.  Don't put the spinach in until the last few minutes so that it stays green and firmer.  Frozen is great, but make sure it's chopped.  The big, fat leaves don't work as well.     This soup also freezes well.  We had a pot of it last night that I had frozen two weeks ago.",

A few changes I've made over time:  I add a chopped onion and double the garlic.  I use HOT Italian sausage (do this if you like a little extra kick).  I use 3 cans of beef broth, and make sure it is LOW SODIUM--I think this is crucial to the success of the recipe, because it is too salty with regular broth.  Delete the 1/4 t salt altogether, unless you feel it needs it at the end.  You can always add salt, but you can't take it away.  I also add 1/2 C of small pasta, whatever I have on hand (macaroni works fine, or use something else to be more elaborate) at the end of the cooking time.  If you'd like to do this, make sure you cook the pasta before adding the spinach.  Karen--thank you for a recipe that has become a household staple for us!",

I dislike reviewers who considerably change a recipe and then rate it on their modifications, but this time, I couldn't seem to help myself...  Doubled the recipe, and used one pound of hot and one of sweet sausage, extra clove of garlic, added celery, small red potatoes, cannelli beans as that's the only type I had on hand, diced canned tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic added and omitted the salt.  Turned off the heat and added thinly sliced zuchinni and the fresh spinach 10 minutes prior to serving.  Absolutely superb flavor!!!  Thanks Sallyjun for the submission!",

I made my own beef broth and along with the sausage I included the beef from the meaty bones I used. Added celery, onions and mushrooms with the carrots, along with some Tuscan seasoning. I used cannellini beans since I prefer them, and at the end threw in ditalini pasta (about 1 c. uncooked) which I had cooked ahead of time so the pasta wouldn't absorb too much of the broth.  Instead of the canned tomatoes I used tomatoes I had put up from my garden. There really is no right or wrong when making Italian soups like this, and the fun thing about it is that it never turns out exactly the same way twice! Sometimes I like to add a glug of red wine, or maybe rice, or various shapes of soup pasta. I did use fresh spinach this time, but Swiss Chard or escarole are nice too! To truly be authentic, sprinkle each serving with good, freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese!",

I added the browned sausage and the rest of the ingredients (plus an onion, a teaspoon of minced garlic - and red pepper instead of green) to the crockpot, and cooked it on low for 5 hours.  I seasoned it with oregano, parsley, and rosemary.  Then I stirred in a half cup or so cooked, drained ditalini before serving.  Served with garlic bread, of course, just wonderful.",

Added onion and extra garlic when browning meat.  Like others... I added additional can beef broth and tomatoe.  I eliminated the zuccini and any additional salt.  When I added the beans (which i never thought i'd like but they add a nice touch) I also added some very small pasta.  The result... delish!!!! Can't wait to serve it to my guests tomorrow!!!",

I liked that it used a lot of vegetables I had in the house and the idea of adding spinach on top which I may try on other soups to add in some extra vegetables. But I did not care for how salty it seemed from the broth and for the sausage. But I have never liked soup with sausage even at the restaurants so it may just be personal taste. I wasn't going to add it but other people were going to be eating it. I think I may have liked it more without the meat a low sodium broth and a little pasta.",
