I have a very Ukrainian/Polish step family, and I grew up eating pirogies. I love sauerkraut and mushroom pirogies but they are not exactly health food.  This recipe is great on its own, as you can enjoy the great flavors while not having to feel guilty about the carbs and fat.\n\nI will definitely be making this again.
