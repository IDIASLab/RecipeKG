With these changes it is the butter cookie that has been passed down in my family and is irresistable especially when combined with icing. I used to make a buttercream frosting until this year when I tried the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe here at allrecipes.com. The recipe has Karo Syrup in it which when dry allows you to stack the cookies on top of each other and you don't even need wax paper to divide the layers. But if you want gooey frosting for the cookies and you don't care as much about storing them just combine 1/4 cup butter with as much powdered sugar and milk to make the amount you need (and don't forget the almond extract because that is what makes these cookies special). I would have combined the icing recipe with the cookie recipe because it's the combo that makes this cookie great.",
