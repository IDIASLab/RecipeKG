I like my salads to have a lot of creamy dressing, so I always make an extra half batch of the wet mix and add it as necessary to get the salad more wet because the pasta soaks up the sauce.",

I don't like any of those, so this recipe works out better! To veganize/dairy/egg free, just use a vegan mayo,  I use apple juice, instead of  milk, it doubles as a sugar, to tone down the vinegar taste from the mayo. I hate vinegar,  and sugar, so the apple juice acts as a mild sweetener, to tone down any vinegar acidic taste, without being overly sweet.",
