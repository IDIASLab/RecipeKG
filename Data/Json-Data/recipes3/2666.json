For the potato flakes I used a pre-fab package of homestlyle butter flavored flakes and this made all of the difference in the world. This soup was very flavorful and didn't require the salt that I thought it would have needed. To put it over the top I recommend adding a pinch of cheese green onions or chives and some cooked turkey bacon crumbled over the top and you have all of the makings of a loaded tator without all of the guilt.",
