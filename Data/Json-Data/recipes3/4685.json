To begin any white sauce I always cook the butter with the flour for a few minutes to eliminate that floury taste sometimes associated with white sauces then add the liquid. This sauce thickened a bit more than I wanted so I thinned it with a splash of white wine. Also I didn't use measure the peppercorns just used a few good turns of the pepper mill. Omitted the nutmeg but used cayenne instead. Very good with freshly grated Parm... thanks!",

I agree that it asks for way too much peppercorn I only add about 1/3-1/2 and in my opinion that flavor can be added at the table. I have tried this dish several different ways: firstly marinade some chicken breasts in Italian dressing and grill then dice and toss into the pasta (I like to use angel hair) serve with bread a salad and a nice wine and you have a great date meal. I have also stirred in chopped or whole grilled shrimp or served it on the side with shrimp scampi as well as steak. For a low fat alternative I use 2% milk and light cheeses. Just be creative and have fun with it!",
