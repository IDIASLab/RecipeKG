This makes 4 generous sides. I realized when I was on my third layer that I had forgotten to brush the eggplant with olive oil, so I only got the third layer. Not sure that really made much of a difference. The only thing I'd suggest it adding more cheese. 1/4 cup if very skimpy to cover the top, but that's personal preference. I used 1/2-3/4 cup total.  Next time I might even add a bit of cheese between the layers. Thanks Anthony for the tasty recipe!",

I also used peppers from my garden that were not that meaty and these, too, should have had a little bit of a sweat. \nWhen I tasted the entire dish nothing had married together, so I added a jar of tomato sauce, two dollops of creme fraiche, whipped it all together, sprinkled the dish with parmesan and panko, added a swipe of oil and baked it for some real comfort. I know that some will say that what I made is not the recipe, but I tried that recipe and found it wanting.",
