Mostly because I was out of olives.  Will definately try olive juice though.  Maybe it is a Wisconsin thing, but I always love Clamato the best.  :o)  If you like a very thick V8 style bloody mary, this is probably not for you though.  I added slightly less hot sauce the second time, because I found it to be a bit spicey for my taste.  If you do not like them very spicey add the hot sauce to taste.  We are having bloody marys this weekend, so my husband wanted me to make pitchers of this recipe for everyone! I will use this recipe over and over! Enjoy!",

Like some of the other reviews I definitely add a big pinch of prepared horseradish and a big teaspoon of A-1. As for the olive juice that's definitely an option but my favorite is banana pepper juice...you can go hot or mild depending on your preference. Then I replace the rimming celery salt with a 50/50 mixture of cajun seasoning and seasoning salt. Add a little football and you've got a perfect Saturday morning!!",
