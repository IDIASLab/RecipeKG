I ended up using less of all the spices and just used them to taste, passing more crushed pepper flakes at the table for whoever wanted it. After mixing everything together it was beyond dry, so I added in a can of chicken broth and heated the whole thing through...The family LOVED it! I have to Thank the submitter for the idea, which became a new family favorite, but IMO, it needs some tweaks.",

Honestly it's not written well and it does need some changes. I knew the amount of pepper was going to be too much (you can't really say that you said \"to taste\" because the variance shouldn't so drastic) but I used that much anyway. It overpowered pretty much every other flavour in the dish. I ate the food half an hour ago and my mouth is still tingling from how much pepper was in there. Most recipes have a ratio of 4:1 for salt and pepper. So the amount of pepper in this one should have been 1/4 tsp. That would have been much better. In addition the ingredients say that the chicken should be cut but it should only say that if you cut it before you cook it or if your ingredients say that the chicken should be grilled and you omit that step from the instructions. I might consider making this recipe again but I'd drastically reduce the pepper so that I might be able to taste any of the other flavours.",

I didn't have Parmesan cheese, so, added shredded Mozzarella cheese, instead.  I stirred everything together until the cheesecake melted.  It was wonderful!",
