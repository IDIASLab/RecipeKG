Also added extra cheese on top.  So delicious!  It's a constant request in the house.  Edit:  I've made this so many times and had so much fun playing around with it that I want to share - 1 cup of crackers (Ritz, cornflakes, saltines, cheese-nips, anything!), 1/2c parm chz, 1 1/2c cheddar, 1/2c bread crumbs.  I also dip the chicken in flour before the butter to help it stick.  This is a great recipe to be adventurous with - do not hesitate to play around!!!  Update 2:  I've discovered Panko bread crumbs to replace the standard crumbs.  WOW!  MUCH crispier and gives it that texture that I've noticed a lot of reviews say is missing.  No panko... try coursely crushing some croutons.",

I greased the pan and followed others' suggestions by putting down a thin layer of bread crumbs in the pan before laying down the chicken.  The chicken tenders only took 18 minutes to bake, and then, following others' suggestions, I broiled the chicken for another 2 minutes.  I HIGHLY recommend broiling the chicken at the end because it gives it a delicious crunch!",

I used crushed cornflakes rather than crumbs, and dill for the oregano, but nothing made this chicken \"wake up.\"  On the upside, this is a \"safe\" chicken recipe, as even the pickiest of eaters wouldn't be able to find something not to like here--no unusual spices or blending of flavors. It was a little too buttery, however, so for those who would like to give this recipe a try I might suggest coating the chicken in egg rather than melted butter, and maybe drizzling a little butter over the top before baking.",
