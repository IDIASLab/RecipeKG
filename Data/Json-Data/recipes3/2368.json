I guess it was thanks to Mom's frugality.  The way these are put together is a little thick for my taste.  You can mix the cheese right in if you want and make them the thickness of regular pancakes.  I like the fact that they have a higher amount of crispiness that way.  I also like to mince up some onion into mine.",

I started with the heat on 2, then got tired of waiting longer than 10 minutes and cranked it to 4... went much faster.  Don't flip the cakes early or you will be scraping them back together in lumpy pancake pieces. (check by lifting a piece to see if they are brown) I used a square flat pan so I rotated them halfway through to keep them evenly browned.  Just keep this in mind when you do this recipe!!!",

I also just added the cheese to the mixture instead of adding cheese on top and a second layer of potatoe mixture. Because I fixed these as part of breakfast and had fried bacon I fried them in some of the bacon grease. Not very healthy but VERY tasty!! The cakes picked up just enough of the bacon flavor. My husband was still talking about them the next day! Thanks!",

She fried her's in bacon drippings and it gave them great flavor. I make mine with the cheese but I like to mix it in. I also use granulated garlic(1/2 teaspoon) and a pinch of cayenne. Sometimes I'll do them by the teaspoon so that they make little mini cakes and serve them as an appetizer. You can do a lot of variations with this recipe. Omit the garlic, add 1/2 cup bacon bits and 1/4 cup finely chopped chives, serve with a dollop of sour cream and you have baked potato cakes. Or you can use a different cheese, or herbs. The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.",
