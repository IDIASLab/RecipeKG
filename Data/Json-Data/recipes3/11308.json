I used one large fresh clove of garlic and a couple of tablespoons minced fresh cilantro instead of dried. I used a green bell pepper a red bell pepper and a red onion. I think I may even try pounding out the whole chicken breast marinating it and grilling it before adding to the vegetables next time. I served with lettuce tomato cheese sour cream & salsa. Very tasty and I will make these again. Thanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This were okay but not great. I followed the recipe nearly exactly but left out the green pepper because of my personal preference. I done all the normal stuff that you expect with fajitas; used a deep frying pan with plenty of surface area heating a bit of oil very hot before adding the chicken but the amount of liquid made it where I had to end up draining it even after shaking off excess because my chicken was boiling instead of getting the nice brown grill we expect from fajitas. In the end they were medicore and bland. I finally just added some hot sauce and generic fajita seasoning just to give it a bit of flavor so it wasn't a total loss. Maybe when I had to drain all the excess liquid I also drained out the flavor. I'm inclined to agree with user happyschmoopies that pounding it out and using it as a marinade and grilling it would be good so I may play with this recipe and give it another shot in the future but I'll be grilling it instead.",
