I keep the rest of the ingredients the same but I do change the method! In a large bowl I mix the olive oil with the minced garlic salt and a dash of cayenne pepper and mash them altogether to infuse the OO with flavor. I soak the roma tomatoes (2-3x more than recipe calls for) in the OO mixture since the tomatoes hold more flavor than any other ingredient. I then add cubed mozzarella and the cooked bowtie pasta mix it altogether THEN scoop out 1-2cups at a time and saute it in a skillet over high heat until the mozzarella is bubbly and going brown adding the basil at the end so it doesn't get brittle and overcooked. And I plate it. DELISH! Helped me woo my husband when we were dating; he still remembers this simple dish as one of his faves that I make.;-) Thanks CookinGirl!",

I cut the recipe in half and used more tomatoes a bit less olive oil and added 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes. I topped it with shredded Parmesan before serving. This is a very versatile recipe that you can suite to your own tastes - use your favorite pasta add a splash or red wine vinegar or balsamic throw in some capers feta cheese mozzarella or Parmesan. No matter what you do it's gonna be tasty. Overall a great recipe!",
