After looking at the other reviews I made some adjustments though...I diced up some onion and cooked it with the meat, which I seasoned with garlic salt, steak seasoning, pepper and paprika. I let my son choose between green beans and peas and he choose peas (the kids love corn so I didn't even need to ask on that one). I didn't have hash brown patties so I finished off the bag of frozen hash brown 'chunks' I had and then chopped up some frozen french fries. As I stirred it all up it seemed dry so I added a can of beef broth and let it simmer together for a few minutes. Just before serving I added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Turned out pretty darned tasty and my husband can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!",
