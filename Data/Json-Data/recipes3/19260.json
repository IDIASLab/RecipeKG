I added parsley flakes, garlic powder, powdered grated parmesan(Kraft in the plastic round container),salt/pepper, and a dash of celery salt to the breading. Then baked covered until the chicken was almost done. I removed the foil and baked long enough for the crust to brown and achieve the crisp stage. I then sprinkled fresh parmesan, cheddar, and mozz. cheese on top and let melt in the oven. Served with mashed pot., spinach madeline, mac & cheese (for my daughter), and yeast rolls. Everyone enjoyed this version and it will become a great meal for the kids!\nThanks for the great start with this recipe!",
