First, I made this slaw the day before and that really brings out the flavor. The broccoli slaw remained crisp and did not get soggy. It also made it so easy for Christmas dinner because that was one less dish that had to be cooked or prepped. Secondly, I used white balsamic vinegar so it would not turn brown.  I reduced the oil from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup because other reviewers had said it was too oily. I used olive oil instead of canola oil because i thought it would taste better in this dish. I increased the maple syrup (use the real stuff only) from 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon to increase the sweetness that other reviewers said it lacked. Also I used honey roasted pecans and almonds which also added a little sweetness as well as crunch.  With the tweaks, it tasted great. Making it a day ahead really made it very easy as well. I recommend giving this recipe a try.  Next time I might add a little crumbled blue cheese or feta.  I think either of those would taste great with these ingredients.",
