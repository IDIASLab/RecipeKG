I did add one jalapeno & loved the bit of heat it added...I think next time I might even add 1/2 of another. I chose to use the fresh parsley although I think basil would be nice also. I was going to make this a first-course but decided this would make a better partner to the meal so I served it w/ Grilled Halibut with Cilantro Garlic Butter some leftover rice frome a stuffed grapes recipe & homemade italian bread cooked on the grill & served w/ infused oil. Pinot grigio paired really well but then again I like it w/ just about everything. LOL",

I blended the mango orange juice and olive oil first with a hand blender then added the rest of the ingredients and used the hand blender for that as well. If you want some texture leave part of the ingredients out and stir in at the end. I opted to use cilantro and it tastes wonderful in the soup. I used pre-sliced mango from Costco and it saved alot of time. Definitely try this. It sounds strange but tastes delicious.",

I had never made cold soup so when I first read the recipe I was a little worried that the onions garlic and so on were not cooked or sauted before putting them in the soup. It was a very HOT day so I followed the recipe to the letter and it was wonderful. This is a real energizing soup. My husband called it Live food. I bought the Mango prepeeled and pitted. It was well worth the extra cost. Because of time I put the soup in the freezer for about an hour and half before serving it. I will definately be experimenting with other Gazpacho recipes. It is easy and very tasty. Thanks",
