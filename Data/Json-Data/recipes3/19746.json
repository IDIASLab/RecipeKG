Appetizers are supposed to whet the desire of things to come, but this particular one, makes people want to forget the dinner, and just keep devouring this DELICIOUS warm dip.  Thank you Dayna for sharing. After the first time I made this dip, I did add one extra step, that I think makes a noticeable difference.  Before placing the Pepperoni on top of the mixture, I render out a lot of the orange (not too pretty) colored fat, by microwaving the Pepperoni, separately, for a bit on a paper towel, and then I place it onto the casserole. If I can't keep the \"vultures\" at bay, I may end up serving this as an entree!",

It didn't taste much like pizza.  I even added the spices to the cream cheese the day before. Well, I hated to waste the appetizer so I gave it another chance the next day and it was FABULOUS.  Perhaps it needed 48 hours rest time or perhaps it needed to be baked first and then refrigerated for a day.  All I can say is that after being heated the next day for the second time, it was a totally different dip.  I served it with baguette slices but that wasn't the way to go.  The saltiness of tortilla chips made a big difference. I think if you toasted the baguettes with olive oil and garlic salt as mentioned by a previous poster, that would work as well.  The cooling of the dip was a bit of a problem.  I think next time I'll add a bit of milk to the cream cheese to soften it.  Bon appetit.",

I must mention two of our best friends Tony and RoseAnne and their kids Gina and Andrea. They're obviously Italian and I just knew they'd love this dish. Ro being very dramatic looked at the plate and wanted to take a pic of it! She's a pip! Needless to say this dip FLEW off the dish within no time! I took \"Laura from Al's\" advice and made this two days before. At times flavors really do need to get acquainted. I also added not only pepperoni to the topping but regular Italian sausage and some onion too. I used my jar of Italian seasonings in addition to my regular garlic and onion powders. A thin chip won't work very well with this. Use something thicker like those mini seasoned bagel chips. Excellent Dayna!",

Use Pizza sauce and add extra cheese.  for pepperoni I nuke it for 20 sec on paper towel to get grease off and then cut up.

It was difficult to serve it was too thick the cream cheese layer very heavy and the cheese on the top kept hardening and made it impossible to dip french bread slices and even broke the bagel chips. I put out a small knife to spread with but even then you would get just big blobs of rubbery cheese. I did not use low fat cheese I know that sometimes causes problems like this but I went for the full fat varieties. Maybe if I kept this on a hot plate it might have worked better....",
