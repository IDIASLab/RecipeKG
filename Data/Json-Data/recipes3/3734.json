Instead of adding the chicken later I added everything at once to give more time to cook. I also just used canned drained black beans and threw in some brocolli. The sesame oil ginger and soy sauce I added later made it \"oriental\" tasting. Another idea is smashing the beans with a spoon to make a paste if you're looking to do more work with the recipe.",
