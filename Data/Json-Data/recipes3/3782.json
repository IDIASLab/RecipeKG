He said that he never had the chiles stuffed with meat (usually just cheese)--but he really liked the flavor.  He said that these were as good as what he had in New Mexico.  I used my own homemade salsa instead of the chopped tomatoes, (which has skinned roma tomatoes, onion, green chiles, cilantro and brown sugar,garlic, salt and pepper) I cooked 1 lb. of hamburger, so I had enough meat left over to use to make tacos another night.  Thanks for a great recipe and for helping me to prepare something my husband really enjoyed.",
