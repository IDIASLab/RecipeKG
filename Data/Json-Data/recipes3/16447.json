Unfortunately she may have to wait for the second batch...this is REALLY GOOD! If you want it mild follow the recipe as written. But if you want it kickin try my modifications: use only 1 tablespoon of oil add 1 minced garlic clove to the onion replace the tomatoes with 2 cans of Ro tel AND keep the 1 can of diced chilies use a blend of shredded cheeses (cheddar monterey jack pepper jack colby etc. whatever you choose) use enough black pepper and cayenne pepper to suit your taste (maybe 1/4 teaspoon of each) and add 1/4 teaspoon cumin. Finally seal the deal with a dash or two of cajun seasoning.",

I did make some suggested substitutions by other reviewers and others to try and make this a \"healthier dip\" (as if such a thing were possible!). I substitued NO FAT Half and Half for the real stuff Neufchatel Cheese for the cream cheese and 2 (10 oz.) cans of Rotel Original diced Tomatoes and Green Chillies (drained) for the separate cans of tomatoes and diced chillies. In addition I only used 8 oz. of Monterey Jack. Finally I added 10 drops of Franks Red Hot Sauce to mixture to spice it up a little. I used a 7 X 11-in glass baking pan....it looked great and tasted great even though these changes make it lower in fat. Highly recommed this recipe!",

I didn't use any salt or pepper and I added a dollop of sour cream and used about two cups of shredded cheese Mexican blend with four different cheeses. I didn't add the half n half either.
