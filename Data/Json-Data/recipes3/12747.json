I did add more of all the spices, but I think that\u2019s just personal taste and an adjustment that anybody would make.  Used great northern beans and loved the soup\u2019s creaminess, even when made with skim milk.  Plan to serve for dinner this evening with a double decker turkey club sandwich.  AishaSahar, we enjoyed your soup!",

I substituted jarred minced garlic for the onion powder and some chipotle molido for the cayenne. I was a bit generous with all the spices, just because. Served it with sour cream and some Texas Cornbread cooked crispy in a cast iron skillet in the oven. My son was thrilled, told me it deserves 4 stars, especially the combination. He was breaking apart his cornbread into chunks and stirring them into his soup. He wants me to make them again! Next time, I plan to use twice the beans.",
