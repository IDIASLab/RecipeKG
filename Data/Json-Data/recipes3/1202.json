I had some trouble with the cream of coconut because the ingredients were cold when I added it and it sort of made little bits of frozen coconut cream. However, everyone really liked it.  The second time I used coconut milk as others had said they did and it was less expensive.  YUK! it all came to the top and froze in a discusting glob.  I had to throw it all out and start over.  My advice, use the cream of coconut, and bring all your ingredients to room temurature bfore mixing.  Also, my first batch was not freezing well after 24 hrs so I added a cup of water to it.  It did not taste watered down and made a better slush consistancy.",

Based on the reviews, I prepared the first batch two nights in advance to make sure it would be slushy, which it was in under 24 hours.  After tasting how good it was, I decided I needed to make more.  The second batch, I eliminated one can of the cream of coconut and put in just a little less vodka to compensate.  This batch tasted just as good as the first.  By the time I made the third batch, I was out of vodka and used regular Bacardi rum and I think this might have been my favorite.  We used ginger ale, Sprite Zero and regular Sprite and they all tasted good.  Several people asked for the recipe.  This is something I will keep in the freezer to enjoy throughout the hot southern spring and summer months!  I can also see children enjoying this in a non-alcoholic version - it's very refreshing.",

I could not find CREAM of coconut so instead I actually added Coconut milk...and just one can instead of two. I mixed it with a mixer to get rid of the white specks. I added one of the lemon lime sodas and froze it for a few hours till it was a beautiful frothy slush and mixed it the other ice cold lemon lime soda right before serving. It was a smash hit! I think it was the best thing at the luau! People raved and raved!!!! FANTASTIC... I will make it a zillion more times. It is a keeper for my forever cookbook!",

I tried to short-cut the process with my Cuisinart ice cream maker and it DID NOT WORK. My back was killing me and needed a \"Plan B\" and used the blender w/ ice instead. Mixed it with the 7-UP after it came out of the blender. My wife and I REALLY enjoyed this. She said it reminds her of something called a \"Swampwater\" her crew used to make when she was in the service. The only difference is to substitute the frozen lemon-aid with frozen lime-aid. Medical note: After two of these (2 x 12 oz.) the muscle spasms ceased and the lower back pain has subsided greatly. I also have one happy wife. It went well w/ my chicken dinner I prepared.",
