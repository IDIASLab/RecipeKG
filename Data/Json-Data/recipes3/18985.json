I modified it a tad, starting with using the standard breading method of flour, egg and (seasoned) bread crumbs.  I browned the chicken in a mixture of butter and olive oil to reduce the burning point temperature.  Once I browned it thoroughly I cut into it and noticed it was still a little pink on the inside \u2013 no problem, I just threw it in a 325 degree oven while I prepared the sauce and cooked some pasta.  While I only made two chicken breasts, I hated to waste the better portion of an 8 oz. carton of chicken broth and half a carton of cream, so I thought what the heck, I\u2019ll use it all!  I added the chicken broth to the pan first, reduced it drastically, then added the entire carton of cream and let it go until the sauce had reduced to a thick and velvety smoothness.  I added the Parmesan and pimiento just before serving and topped the chicken with a basil chiffonade rather than stirring it into the sauce.  The chicken was tender and moist, the coating dry, golden and crispy (rather than mushy and soggy), complemented by the luxurious, rich sauce.  The pimiento was a nice touch, subtly enhancing the sauce.  I\u2019m glad I had the extra sauce - it was perfect for some nice pasta!  Since this is a dinner a little on the rich side, I chose to serve it with just a few pattypan squash, lightly seasoned with butter, salt and pepper.  At the risk of sounding corny, this was a GLORIOUS dinner.",

My husband was looking for more of a tomato basil cream sauce so I added a 14.5 oz. can of italian sytle diced tomatoes to some of it and a little sugar and we had it!",

I substituted half and half for the heavy cream used 2 tsp dried basil doubled the sauce and added a little corn starch to thicken it. I served it over fettucini. Overall it was good...my family liked it a lot but personally I thought it was more work than I like (frying the chicken then setting it aside grating the parmesean etc.) I imagine it would be very good with fresh basil and maybe some fresh tomatoes (nice summer dish)",

I thought I'd try the sauce first. The sauce - well I subbed half & half. I used 2c thinking it was going to be fabulous - & so I could have half with basil half without. I just melted a little butter added the half & half & heated. Added a cup of parmesan & almost 1/4t freshly ground black pepper. Stirred till melted which takes longer than I expected; but maybe I just added it too soon. I read in another review not from this recipe about using mozzarella as a thickener instead of cornstarch or flour. Hmmm I tried it. 'Didn't work on this one. I added a half cup of shreddded mozzarella & still had to thicken with 2T cornstarch. Maybe the mozzarella trick would be a trick for when your first choice didn't thicken enough. Sooo it was good then. Nice & thick & yum. I added a third cup or so fresh basil to a cup of the sauce. I love basil. I love it. I love it love it love it; but it just didn't do anything for me in this recipe. I wanted it too. What a great idea - creaminess of parmesan & fresh basil. 'Sounded great but notsomuch. Oh yeah I'll eat it; but prefer it without my precious basil.:)",
