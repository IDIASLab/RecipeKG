My mother adds ham and asparagus to it. I usually use tri-colored pasta in this salad to add even more color. Also I serve green onions on the side. All my friends and family love this so much. I don't think I would be invited on our annual family camping trip if I didn't bring this salad.",

Too often it s just salad dressing but these three together provided good flavor. Would recommend that you mix them together before adding to your pasta salad and plan on making more of it because without it I think you ll have dry pasta (I did). The one thing that I thought was lost in this salad was the cheddar cheese and I used a good-quality one so doubtful I ll include that in the future. We don t eat a lot of pasta salads but we enjoyed this one with its tangy dressing and sweet-dill flavor from the relish and pickles.",
