If you don't like sauerkraut then it is not for you but for us who have Polish roots it's a favorite. A word about the rice unless you are using minute rice always precook your rice or at least cook it halfway to done before putting it in a recipe like this one. I have also made this dish using the suggestion of another reviewer of adding the can of tomato soup. If you really feel lucky then put a layer of fresh cabbage on the bottom of the pot then your meatballs and add a half of the tomato soup and finish it off on the top with one of the cans of sauerkraut (only use one can of Kraut) and finish with the other half can of soup.This is similar to a stew my grandma use to make at New years. Very good but only if you like cabbage!",

You probably won't need that extra 30 minutes otherwise your pork will be tough. Keep in mind that ground pork is VERY LEAN. Therefore it cooks up firm. If you want fattier meatballs that are softer when finished you can mix in some beef which would be yummy too. Or you could use pork sausage which has lots of fat to make it chewier.
