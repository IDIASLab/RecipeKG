I'd like to suggest letting the loaf sit for 15 minutes before cutting, this will prevent oozing of the cheese. \r\nWhen I made it the second time, I dicovered a way to simplify the rolling process and had great success.\r\nI divided my meat mixture into 3 batches and cheese into 2 batches (like a lasagne).  Fill the bottom of a 9x13 dish with the 1st batch, then sprinkle cheese on top, avoiding the edges.\r\nI then pat the 2nd batch on top, taking a little care to seal the edges with a spatula.  Cheese on top of that.\r\nFinally, the 3rd batch of meat on top of that, sealing the edges again.\r\nI then sprinkled ketchup and mustard overall.  It came out tasting the same as the recipe indicated, but saves much time and effort.\r\n",

I didn't have any wax paper, and parchment made it really easy to roll up. There was one spot where I didn't seal it well, so the cheese goozed out. I also baked it in a loaf pan and periodically drained the grease and let it sit for 15 minutes to ease in slicing it. Thanks Douglas, this was a winner in our house! :)",
