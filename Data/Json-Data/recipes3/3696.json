If your hands end up burning rub them in milk not a milk based product..MILK. It takes the burn away immediately and even works on the lips (sometimes it burns there too after eating a hot pepper). My Grandma used the oil method and passed it along to me and also the rubbing of the milk. IT WORKS TRUST ME!!!",

It won't feel like it's burning when you are doing it but a few hours later the burning will be so intense you can barely stand it! Also I tried leaving some of the seeds in as one of the reviewers suggested and they were REALLLLY hot. So if you do that be really careful how many seeds you leave in. Perhaps it was just the batch of peppers that I used...but I think they would've been hot enough without any seeds. My husband and I both LOVED the cream cheese filling with the cilantro and roasted garlic though...it was to die for. I will definitely make again - but I will definitely wear gloves next time and save myself from being in agony all night long (seriously...the burning lasted more than 12 hours...)",

Anyway I enjoyed them and I would make them again only next time I might leave my own addition of chopped jala OUT so that my pussy cat of a hubby can enjoy them too! Haha! Thanks for the recipe!:o) And yes use a ziploc baggie (as someone else pointed out) to pipe the filling into the jala.; it is a BIG help in saving time and its so much less messy!",
