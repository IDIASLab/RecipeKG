                "reviewBody": "I LOVED LOVED LOVED the flavor in these but I did have issues with execution as written. As soon as the cakes hit the oil they completely disintegrated into the grease. The first skillet full was a waste and it was getting late so I stuck the rest on a cookie sheet and stuck them in the freezer and forgot about them for a couple of days. I was hoping the freezer alone would cure the issue but it didn't. I ended up dipping the cakes in egg and then flour/breadcrumb mixture and that did the trick. You definitely need a binder for this recipe. Normally I wouldn't mess with a recipe again if it gave me trouble but the flavor of these are so good that I will most definitely make these again. I'll just be sure to use a binder next time. These are delicious!",
