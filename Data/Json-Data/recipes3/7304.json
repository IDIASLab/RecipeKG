I only used a 16ounce can of red tomatoes and didn't add the red cherry pepper (didn't have any!) The biggest improvement for me was that I blended the veggies in a blender after cooking. (Just a bit!) This made it much creamier and smoother. (Plus my kids didn't pick out the chunks of veggies!) I also added a whole cup (rather than a 1/2) of heavy cream as another reviewer wrote. I also boiled the chicken in chicken broth to cook it (juicier) and then cut it up and added it to the sauce to simmer for 30 minutes. Yummo! Thanks for the recipe!",

My husband is from Mohawk NY near Utica and this is one of his favorite all time meals. I did make a few changes so that it was more like his sisters recipe. For the peppers I used 3 jalapenos 1 habanero pepper and 3 teaspoons of Asian chili garlic sauce (for all of you who thought this needed a kick you should try adding the chili garlic sauce it makes any dish pop!). I also added a small can of black olives a small can of mushrooms (you could use fresh) and I increased the the cream to 1 cup (to save calories you could use milk). The key to this recipe is letting it simmer before adding the rigatoni and cream. Just let everything else simmer on low covered in the pan for about 1 - 1 1/2 hours. This makes everything soft and flavorful. Them after an hour or so add the cream let simmer for 10 minuets. Then cook your rigatoni. Then add the sauce to the cooked rigatoni. Stir well and serve. It's even better the next day after the sauce has absorbed into the rigatoni. Delicious! My Upstate New York Husband loved it!",
