I don't usually make recipes that only have one review but I was on a strict dietary plan and this fit the bill so I decided to give it a try. I am so glad that I did! My sister and her roommate asked for the recipe and ended up making a double batch of the sauce the very next day so they could freeze some to use for meal prep. The only thing I did differently was roast the toin the oven because I didn't have access to a grill that day. Thank you",
