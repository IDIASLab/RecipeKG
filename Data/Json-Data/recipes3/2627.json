Used 1 can of lower sodium chicken broth, 4.) added a can of drained black olive slices (the little can) and 5.) Topped with shredded cheddar. \r\nVERY tasty!

I think next time I will drain corn and reduce amount to 1 can since the corn added a certain amount of sweetness that I didn't care for. I also increased amount of chilli since we like our food hot. I also topped with cheddar cheese and baked till cheese melted. Overall good recipe that I will make again.",

I dont think I'll add it into the tamale next time. I thought there was way too much pork so i will halve the amoutn of pork next time. The meat did come out very juicy and I was happy with that. I utilized the 18cm cristel pot to cook the meat and water in an oven until the meat was thoroughly cooked (I put the water in half way as the recipe stated). The amout of the water left over from the pork for the tamale mixture was not enough so I needed to add 2 cups more water before adding the pork water. The texture came out fine since I listened to other reviewers but if I had followed the original directions then I think i would have a really dry dish.",
