I love it when a few simple ingredients you have around the house come together to create something so good. I used rice wine vinegar vs. white vinegar because it's milder and sweeter. I also used low sugar seedless raspberry jam and upped that a bit 'til I got the consistency and taste I wanted. Poppyseeds would be a great addition but this was fine as is and was perfect over mixed salad greens with thin sliced red onion Granny Smith apple toasted walnuts dried cranberries and a bit of feta cheese sprinkled over top - YUM!",
