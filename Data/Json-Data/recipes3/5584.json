For one thing it was WAY too much pasta for the amount of other ingredients. I could tell that going in so I cut back the spaghetti by QUITE a bit and still somewhat felt like I was eating pasta with a hair of flavoring. Since I think it has potential and I like the combo of salami bacon and Parmesan I might work with this and see if I can figure out a good balance in the ingredients.",
