This one is excellent.  First, roasting the mushrooms rather than saut\u00e9ing them not only simplifies the preparation, it also lends a deeper, bolder mushroom flavor.  The wee bit of rosemary and thyme is subtle yet makes its presence known, and gives the soup definition and character beyond just the one dimensional taste of the mushrooms.  Outside of adding another four ounces or so of mushrooms only because I had them to use, I stuck to the recipe as directed and was quite happy with it. While it may not be a chunky, hearty soup it is deceptively just as substantial and filling.  Nicely done.",

Taste wise the rosemary and thyme were spot on with the mushrooms but I used 1 large onion and it was way too much. Roasting the mushrooms for 15 minutes was not enough to bring out the flavor and added additional fat unnecessarily (with the EVOO). If I try again I would roast the onions with the mushrooms and roast for at least 30 minutes at 350.For mushroom lovers definitely worth a try because it may fit your family's tastes.",
