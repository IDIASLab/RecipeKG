I threw in literally most of our leftovers and it came out great!! About a 1/4 cup diced each: leftover chicken mushrooms onion cilantro bleu cheese and green pepper. It was fan-tastic and was all gone by the end of the evening! I will go to this recipe over and over again to refresh my leftovers!!!",

I also used fresh instead of frozen spinach threw in a little onion some fresh tomatoes portabella mushrooms oregano marjoram and topped each serving with a fresh basil and oregano leaf. I really liked the bread crumb idea...it made for a nice texture. I didn't have evaporated skim milk so I used one can of regular evaporated milk and 12 oz of 2% milk (I doubled the original recipe) however that made it quite moist and I think next time I will reduce the amount of liquid a bit.",
