I used 3 lbs. of red skinned potatoes and because I wanted a little crunch I added 1/2 cup of finely chopped celery and 4 choppped green onions.  For the dressing I used 1 & 1/4 cups each of lite sour cream and lite mayo, 1 Tbsp. of dill weed, kept the rest of the ingredients the same and added a couple dashes of white wine vinegar.  I let it set overnight and the flavors blended together very nicely.  It was a great change from your regular potato/egg salads.",

Using tips from other reviewers I made the dressing using 1/2 cup reduced fat mayo a little more than 1/2 cup light sour cream 2-3 tbs red wine vinegar 1.5 tsp dried dill 1 tsp dried parsley 1/2 tsp sugar 1 stick celery-minced several dashes of cayenne several dashes of garlic powder salt & pepper to taste. It was a little dill heavy but in a good way as my fiance is very fond of dill. Also the amounts I used are more like guidelines. I added a little more of this or that until I thought it tasted \"right.\" And to make sure I had the right amount of dressing to potatoes I added the dressing to 3/4 of the potatoes I prepared and added more until the ratio looked about right. Mashed the rest as to not waste. I would have added bacon bits but we have a vegetarian in the house so we added some to our individual servings. I will certainly be making this potato salad again.",

This was really good with 2 TBS of FRESH parsley. (I kept adding more). I think this made it for I had to use dry dill (fresh would have been better). I substituted a couple TBS. of mayo. This does need an acidic ingredient which I added in the form of citric acid in the homemade dill dip mix I added. Lemon juice could substitute with some instant minced onion and dry garlic. HINT: Make the dressing taste like a good salty dill dip that you like THEN mix in! You shouldn't be disappointed.",
