I usually opt for tart green apples and find the flavour to be just present but not overpowering. I use slightly less broth (4 cups) to avoid having an overly watery soup and I always leave out the cream entirely - the soup is so yummy there's simply no need for it. I've made this soup a few times now and the only changes I made aside from those mentioned above is adding three small-medium carrots if they're on hand and putting goat cheese on top before eating.",
