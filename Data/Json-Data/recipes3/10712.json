Here is what I did to stream line this and eliminate the blender and a couple of bowls. Put the cauliflower on to steam. While the cauliflower was steaming melt the 2 Tablespoons butter in a skillet add the finely chopped mushrooms (next time I would add some finely chopped onion too) Add the flour and cook for a few minutes add the half & half (I use low fat milk instead) stir to create a thick sauce. Mine was about the consistency of Condensed Cream of Mushroom soup. Separate the eggs putting the yolks into a large bowl and the whites into the mixer bowl. Add the green onions Parmesan cheese & seasoning to the yolks and stir well. Add the steamed and slightly cooled cauliflower and using a fork mash and stir until well mixed and the cauliflower is slightly mashed. Add the mushroom / white sauce & stir well. Beat the egg whites and fold in. This fit nicely into a 9\" deep dish pie pan. Grease the pie pan well or this will stick! It baked perfectly in 35 minutes. I omitted the curry powder and next time I would definitely add it. Thanks for a healthy low carb breakfast.",

I think that was the cause of the extra water which I ended up draining by tipping the pan slightly 1/2 through baking.
