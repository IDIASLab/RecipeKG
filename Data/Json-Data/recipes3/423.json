I did make a few minor changes, not so much in the cake but the frosting.  For the cake, I separated the eggs.  I added the egg yolks with the cake mix, but beat and folded in the egg whites once the entire batter was smooth.  It makes for a much lighter cake.  I also added a touch of coconut oil for a little more intensive coconut flavor.  I baked it in three 8\" cake pans.  For the frosting, I used coconut extract and two tablespoons of the cream of coconut instead of the milk.  I added two cups of sweetened shredded coconut to the frosting.  Once it was set up (after refrigerating it overnight), I patted more coconut all over the top and sides.  It turned out so beautiful that my neighbors have put in their orders.  Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!",

This cake only got better after being in the refrigerator...(a great lunchbox treat). Two things to be aware of: The batter proved a bit too much volume for the pans so a little bit spilled over. I cooled the layers and trimmed the lip that the spilling caused. After frosting cake \"settles\" a teeny bit. Probably because of the oil coconut cream and sour cream. Since it was for my daughter I left the top bare for a Barbie \"frosting transfer\" put the coconut on the sides and added some Barbie pink and white heart sprinkles. It was beautiful.",
