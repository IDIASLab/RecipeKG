This recipe comes quite close and was a big hit the three times I served it. I used Vinho Verde for the wine to stay authentic used 2 teaspoon paprika instead of 1 added a teaspoon coriander to the marinade to give it a little more depth and cut the salt back to 2 teaspoons. Clams (littlenecks) will tend to open at different times so remove them from the pan as they open to assure they stay tender. Add them back to the pan for the last minute after adding back the pork.",
