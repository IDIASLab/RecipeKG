I wouldn't advise either of these changes as my patties were a bit too fat and never really got crispy and my husband said they were too floury. I will try them again and update my rating then! Update:Well I tried these again this time following the recipe (except that I added a little grated parmesan!) and they were much better. They never really got crispy maybe because I didn't flatten them enough but I really liked them the way they were.",

I made some changes to this recipe first I increased the eggs to 6 and increased the flour to 3/4 cup because when I mixed according to these directions it seemed way too much spinach for the amount of eggs. I would definitely add cheddar the next time and maybe a few tablespoons of diced tomatoes. This was good fix for a fried craving but I think it may have a better texture if it were baked. I was hoping that the thought and appearance of pancakes would persuade my picky 5 year old to try it but I ended up mixing up a batch of real pancakes anyhow.
