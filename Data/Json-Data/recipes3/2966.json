The second time I made it, I decided to use sesame oil instead of olive oil.  This way, the calorie/fat difference was negligible, but the sesame flavor was included--YUMMY!!  I also doubled the garlic and halved the cumin, as others suggested.  I used 1 T lemon juice and added bean juice, as needed, during the blending process.  For those on WW, 1/4 of this recipe is 2 points...put it on cucumber spears or carrot chips and you can't go wrong!  :)",

After tasting it I knew it needed a little zip and some of the other recipes had called for it. Just what it needed.  I just used the bottled stuff I had in the fridge and that worked wonders!  Also, I didn't actually measure out the spices, so I can't verify that the portions given in this are correct.     I'm pretty positive I didn't use the entire amount of cumin called for.  I also used kosher salt.  If you like garlic, I added an extra clove and I loved it. If your mix is gritty at all, don't fret.  Just add a little more oil or lemon juice and blend more in the food processor.  I think this would have not worked well in the blender.  I served it with homemade naan bread and cucumbers.  DELICIOUS!! (The first time I made I just ate it with some corn chips and it was great with that too.)",

The chili paste gives it a real kick.  I'm thinking kalamata olives and artichokes may work, too.  Awesome recipe.",
