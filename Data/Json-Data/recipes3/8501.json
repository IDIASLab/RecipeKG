I made them generally as written, but with the following minor changes:  used Panko bread crumbs instead of italian (only because I didn't have Italian on hand), used chopped fresh basil instead of the fresh oregano but did put in about 1/2 tsp dried oregano so as not to miss out on its flavor, 3/4 tsp dried rosemary instead of fresh, 1/2 tsp regular mustard (no dry mustard on hand).  \n\nFlavor is great.  In fact, they remind me of italian sausage (yum).  These did not need a broiler pan....the turkey didn't produce any fat or run-off.  In fact, 30 minutes was a little too long and mine were a touch dry.  I had scaled the recipe down to 1 lb ground turkey and rolled the meatballs relatively small, so maybe that had something to do with it.  Next time I'll start checking them at 20 minutes and see when they're done.  I will definitely be making them again!",

I also cut down the crushed red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon which was perfectly spicy enough.  I also have no idea what Melt is so I just sprayed the broiler pan with an olive oil Pam spray.  I served simply over thin spaghetti with a light marinara sauce and a side of broccoli rabe.  It was delicious!",

Plus, I took some advice from Michelle A's comment.  I used 1 pound of 93% lean ground turkey.  1/2 tsp dried oregano, 3/4 tsp dried rosemary, 1.5 Tbsp fresh basil, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (hubby doesn't like spicy), 3 Tbsp finely chopped yellow onions, and 1 Tbsp light butter.  Everything else was as listed above.  I made 20 meatballs and baked for 20 minutes which was perfect. Tastes like a sausage meatball!  Hubby asked me to be sure to not loose this recipe. 1 meatball made with my changes is 60 calories and 2.5 g fat.  Still plan to try the recipe as written, but I had to rate it since it is a FABULOUS base recipe!",
