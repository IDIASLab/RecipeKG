I would cook the pinwheels at a little higher temperature. I checked the pinwheels at 12 minutes and the puff pastry still wasn't cooked so I upped the temperature to 375 for 4-5 minutes and they were cooked perfectly. I I do think I would prefer deli corned beef to pastrami next time. They were best served hot or slightly warm. Be sure to cut with a serrated knife!",
