Certainly not lacking in flavor and rather simple to make. You don't miss the rice at all.  This does make quite a bit of filling, so really pack them tight and expect a bit left over.  I cut my peppers in half and piled them high with filling.  The only thing I wouldn't bother with next time is putting the tomatoes directly into the dish as they don't cook \"up into the peppers\" as stated in the directions, and don't add anything to the overall flavor. The cook time was spot on and left a nice firmness to the peppers. I like to meal prep and these make fantastic lunches!",
