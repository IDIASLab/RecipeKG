I used dark chocolate chips and added a couple drops of vanilla extract but kept everything else the same. These baked up beautifully. I've never made lava cakes before and these came out right the first time. I did end up baking mine about 14 1/2 minutes and probably ended up using about 6-8 oz of dark chocolate chips. I will make these again--and maybe add a little coffee to the next batch for an extra oomph of flavor!",
