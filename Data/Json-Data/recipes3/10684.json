I also used blue cheese, which is my favorite. The texture and the variety of taste is wonderful. The joining of mint and basil is the success of this dish. And just about anything will compliment this recipe. When we served this as leftovers we topped it with a sweet, Italian dressing that really set it off. Definitely a keeper.",
