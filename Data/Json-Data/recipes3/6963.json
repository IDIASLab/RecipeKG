Follow the directions in the recipe but don't put the totellini in until time specified on the package. Mine said cook for 2 minutes. If you put in for the full 30 minutes as recipe states you'll have over cooked pasta! I forgot to buy mushrooms so I had to leave them out but I really want to try it again with them. This was my first time cooking with leeks and I really liked the flavor; I asked my produce guy and he suggested to only use the white part of them.. I also only used 1 Tablespoon of tobasco and it was just right for our liking! After about an hour the tortellini starts to soak up the liquid so you may want to add an extra cup of broth. Hubby loved it and I did too! Will make again and again!..Thanks!",

I used the 3 cheese tortellini but it came with spinach pasta. I used chicken stock instead of chicken broth for a richer base. I doubled the recipe because we have a big family and that made the recipe call over just over a 1/4 cup of hot sauce!!! That would have killed us!!! I used Tabasco and measured added and tasted after each tablespoon and ended up with 2 1/2 tablespoons for the amount of liquid. I added chopped baby spinach just before I served this and it was an excellent addition. I served it with crusty bread and it was a fabulous meal. All of that being said as others have shared I was skeptical at first that this would have any flavor at all. But evidently just the stock with the hot sauce and salt and pepper were enough. I assume that the stock also picked up the flavor of the sausage and other veggies as it cooked as well. Very good soup and hubby says I get a gold star for this one: )",

There's something about the combination of sausage and tortellini in chicken broth with fresh cilantro and hot sauce - WOW! The flavors all mesh beautifully and develop into the most tasty delicious soup I've had in a LONG time. Definitely give this one a try - it's amazing how much flavor you get with minimal ingredients! Oh also I didn't have leeks on hand so I used a whole onion instead and it was fantastic.",
