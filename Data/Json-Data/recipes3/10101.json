        "description": "This is a traditional Canadian dish. The main ingredient is grated potatoes. This was handed down from my family in Nova Scotia. It was always a special treat because originally it was so much work to make but it really was worth waiting for. The traditional method for the grated potatoes was to get a cookie sheet and drive nails through it to create a giant potato grater. After grating (always scraped a knuckle or two), we'd place the mushy potato into a towel and twist it until all the juice was gone. Ouch! Sometimes the towel would rip, shooting the mix everywhere. Now we use our juicing machine.",

I also use very thin boneless chops which adds some great flavor. I bake the chops with some olive oil, salt and pepper. I also find that using a juicer changes the entire consistency of the potatoes. I still do it the old fashioned way with a grater by hand. My one bit of advise is salt and pepper everything!",
