I didn't do anything different except for adding an extra clove of garlic and eliminated the mushrooms (personal preference). I also reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and it was fine. I had to use about a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce. Will make again for sure. Thanks for a delicious and quick recipe:-) UPDATE...Ive made this many times and it has become one of our favorites. I finally tried it with fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and it is just as delicious!",
