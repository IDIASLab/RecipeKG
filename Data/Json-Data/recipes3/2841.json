I do want to make two suggestions.  First, because I was taking this to a family get together, I felt the 6 servings shown on the original recipe would not be enough so I doubled it to 12 servings.  Don't do that!!  It turned out to be more like 30 servings.  Also, I'm not a chef but I love to cook and the \"Prep Time\" of 30 minutes turned out to be more like 60 minutes!!  Just something to keep in mind.  Otherwise, thanks for a great recipe, Heather!  This one is a keeper!!!",

I also seared boneless breast filets then diced them and finished cooking in a pan bringing 1 cup water 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup soy sauce then adding the chicken and stirring constantly until thoroughly cooked then drained and added to the salad. This keeps the chicken extremely moist. The salad was awesome and disappeared in a flash.",
