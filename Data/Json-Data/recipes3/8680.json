I didn't need as much cake as the recipe clearly states it makes so I halved the filling but retained the base as written. I ended up with one 9\" cheesecake and 4 individual tarts. The balance of flavors is perfect I was a little concerned it might be to strong an anise flavor but it isn't. This isn't an inexpensive cake so save your pennies for that super special occasion (mine is my DS birthday) and then enjoy this decadent treat. Thanks Bon Appetit - this is perfect!",
