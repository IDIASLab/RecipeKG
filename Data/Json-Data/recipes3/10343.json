I use red cabbage - they say it tastes better.  We like our cabbage crunchy so we fry it no more than 20 min.  If we have them, we add a chopped apple to the cabbage, then add kielbasa & bacon to warm.  Fantastic quick meal.  Stars are for as written.",

I like this recipe because it\u2018s pretty bare bones, which is generally my preference with cooking and with seasoning.  If you\u2019re working with good ingredients they don\u2019t require a lot of camouflage.  At the submitter\u2019s suggestion, I did \u201cbuild\u201d on this to \u201cmake it my own.\u201d  First, I used our Milwaukee\u2019s Usinger\u2019s fresh Polska Kielbasa, the very best. (As opposed to fully cooked smoked kielbasa which is also very good! I usually like a mix of both, truth be told) I cooked and browned it in advance, refrigerating it until I was ready to put the dish together.  I did add minced garlic along with the onion.  When cooking the cabbage I helped it along with a little water and covered it for a bit.  With the cabbage cooked and the fresh kielbasa cooked, ready and waiting, all I did was combine the two and heat it through, the one hour simmering time, in  my view, not only unnecessary but quite possibly even counterproductive.  Tiny boiled red potatoes with butter and parsley rounded the meal out nicely.",
