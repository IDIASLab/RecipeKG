I wasn't sure about \"brown sugar substitute\" as the only kind I can find is Splenda Brown Sugar BLEND which would call for half of the 1C if following the normal rules between Splenda and Splenda BLEND. So I compromised and used 1/2C regular Splenda and 1/4 C of the brown sugar blend. This equals 1C of sweetness. Anyway that was all I changed and it came out AMAZING. I can't understand a one star review at all. YUM.",
