It needs Italian herbs. The meatballs would have been decent I think if they hadn't been way over-cooked. As written, they get cooked for almost an hour by the time you saute them, the IP comes to pressure, the 20 minute cook time, and then the release of the pressure. Not a recipe I can recommend, sorry.",
