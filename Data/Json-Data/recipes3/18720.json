I was looking for a chicken salad recipe that incorporated curry without a \"sweet\" ingredient such as grapes raisins etc. I left out the celery as the fiance hates it and substitued chopped walnuts for the crunch factor. Oh well he didn't like it anyway. He loves Indian food but he thought the curry flavor in a chicken salad was really odd. His loss more for me! Also added a pinch of salt pepper a bit of mustard and a tiny bit of cayenne pepper for a little heat. Perfect in pita pockets.",

I like curry in small amounts and this was subtle rather than overwhelming.  I would have used for sandwiches but there were nowhere near enough mayo to keep this together for bread.  So I ate just as a salad, and it was pretty good (but not great).  I think it would work well in pita and I'd like to try that.  I also agree that smaller pieces of chicken work better.",
