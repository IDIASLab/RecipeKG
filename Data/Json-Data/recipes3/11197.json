Albeit, the roast was still very soft and not completely cooked, it looked appetizing. After the second time, the roast crisped up on the outside but almost all the juice evaporated. The flavor is very good, though. Thank you for the recipe.",

I substituted paprika for dill, and added a pinch of cayenne.  I rubbed olive oil, then the spice mixture over the whole thing.  I wrapped in plastic and refrigerated over night.  In the morning I put the roast in the oven and 4 large baking potatoes.  After the first hour I turned the oven off.  We went hiking.  When we returned the 3 hours were just up.  It took about 45 minutes to get up to 128 degrees.  Served with horseradish sauce, baked potatoes and a bagged Caesar salad.",
