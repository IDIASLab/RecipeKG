I altered the recipe by omitting the olive oil and using just the bacon grease to fry the onions & garlic. I used Hormel Natural Choice Bacon b/c it does not use hormone added pork or nitrites/nitrates. Also I omitted the red pepper flakes as the black pepper was enough kick for us. My teenage boys gobbled this up! My mom who doesn't like turnip greens like them now! A definite keeper for my family for such a healthy side of greens onions & garlic. Thank you for sharing Chef Scott! I'm looking forward to mixing the greens as the recipe calls for.",
