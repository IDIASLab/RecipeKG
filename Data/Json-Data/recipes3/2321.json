I omitted the poppy seeds because I didn't have any and instead added about a teaspoon of chilli powder. I also omitted the salt as I do with many recipes for a more sodium-conscious diet. Results...absolutely amazing! Beautifully roasted crispy and moist. The honey and chilli powder married nicely for just the right amount of sweetness and kick! I can't wait to make this again! (7/1/12) UPDATE: Well I've made these a few times since my initial review and I must say they never fail. This is a five-star recipe! If I coukd afford it I would make these every week! They always turn out wonderfully and sssooo delicious! A couple of times on special occasions I've done another reviewer suggested and cooked them whole. (I added a little more time and checked for doneness.) They present so well and each guest enjoyed that they had their own little hen! (Most ate half and carried the rest home another meal. Of course I could only do this with a small dinner party. Usually I still cut them in half cook and serve.) (6/5/16)",
