I then sprinkled ground red (cayenne pepper) and a onion and garlic mixture on it (I didn't have fajita seasoning) Then i spooned sour cream on it and smoothed a thin layer on each. I then topped it with some salsa and the remaining cheese. I had thick chicken breasts so I cooked on 350 for 40 minutes. It was incredibly delicious and tender (even warmed up later as leftovers).",
