I didn't follow any of the directions - just the ingredient list and this was amazing!!! Super easy and the flavors were amazing. Coconut aminos mixed with the peppers gave a sweet and spicy flavor. This a very light beautiful dish. I am not a fan of soy sauce (the soy or the harsh flavor) so I was really happy with the result that I got. You can't mess this up.",

I was out of carrots so I just left that out.  I used cooked spaghetti instead of rice noodles.  I'm sure this would be even better with all fresh ingredients, but I really loved all the onions and other flavors, definitely not lacking in taste!  And another big plus-  so fast to make!",
