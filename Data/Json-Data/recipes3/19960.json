When they are done I simply add the cheese close up the foil and when the cheese is melted transfer to a dish this is excellent with grilled skinless boneless chicken breasts basted with garlic butter on the grill. The recipe I used was about 15 years ago and I still use it today. I live alone and its an easy meal to make for one while its cooking I clean up any mess in the kitchen fix me a salad and when its done eat the potatoes and chicken.",
