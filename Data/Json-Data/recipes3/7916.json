I go to make the recipe and then realize that the only thing I halved was the yogurt and kept all of the other ingredient amounts the same but no worries because it was fantastic this way! I also added a clove of finely minced garlic. I will definately be using this recipe again and often very tasty! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I do feel like it's missing something - not quite sure what (lemon juice?) but it's not had an hour to sit yet so will tuck away in fridge and come back once flavors have meshed:) UPDATE: oHHHHHHHH!!! yUMMMMM",
