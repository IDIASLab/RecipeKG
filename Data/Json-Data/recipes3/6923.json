First of all, I did not have any balsamic vinegar on hand, so I used red wine vinegar instead. Secondly, while pureeing the mixture, it became very dry, so I added water until it was the desired consistency. Other than those two changes, the recipe was fantastic! I made this for Christmas, and everyone loved it's amazing flavor!",

Over time I have made some adjustments to suit my particular tastes: I add 2 cloves garlic 3 tablespoons olive oil (this makes it very rich and gives it a great texture) 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar and 2 teaspoons soy sauce. I also add a few squirts of lemon juice. The most important advice I can about this recipe is to make sure you use a packed 1/2 cup of basil. Measure the basil until it fills the 1/2 cup totally packed down. This gives it the perfect basil-y flavor!",
