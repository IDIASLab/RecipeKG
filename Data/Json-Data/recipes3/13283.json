To make this kid-friendly I also stuff the burgers with two slices of aged Swiss cheese. Yum! They will come out square - the kids really like that.",

There wasn't quite as much filling as I thought there would so I ended up cutting them open a bit and adding more cheese. It didn't get melted that way though so next time I will just add more cheese in the beginning. Great recipe!",
