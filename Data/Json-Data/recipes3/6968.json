I didn't use any table salt and only half of the seasoned salt (basically 1/4 of what the original recipe called for. I used minced garlic and added 2 Tbsp. of olive oil. I let this marinate all day. The result was a very flavorful tender smoky cut of steak and sirloin is not the best cut of meat either so I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely try this again but on strips or rib eyes.",
