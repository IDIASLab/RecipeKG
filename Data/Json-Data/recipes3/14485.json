So yeah this is pretty darn delicious and so much neater than making actual buffalo wings which I love. I made this to plan on taking it to work with me during the week. It's gonna work out great!......The only thing I changed was that I used both breasts of a small rotisserie chicken instead of raw meat. I just shredded it and put it in at the end. Everything else I did pretty much to the letter. It's GREAT. I like spicy food but I really enjoyed this more with juuuust a bit more bleu cheese dressing on top. I used a top quality blue cheese dressing and that seemed sort of important...it was creamier than lesser brands. o in all it was just GREAT and I'd definitely make it again. Thanks for combining two of my favorite foods Sandman!",
