Made it a second time with dark soy sauce but reduced the amount and it was good.  Careful with the dark soy sauce because it's very salty.  Overall, an excellent, easy, delicious recipe.\nUpdate 2/23/2010 - I have made this recipe more than 50 times now, both on the grill and in the oven.  Now I skip the dark soy sauce altogether because I don't think it needs it and the regular soy sauce gives it enough flavor.  I also add some sugar for a bit of sweetness and I always let it marinate overnight.  I have made this for BBQs so many times and everyone loves it!  It's a great recipe.",

I think it's because of the quality of soy sauce oyster sauce and sesame oil. If you buy the good ones from an Asian store it won't be that salty. If you buy the ones from a regular grocery store those soy sauce and oyster sauce are SUPER salty and the taste quality is not so good. The brands I used are: Lee Kum Kee (Oyster Sauce) Kadoya (Sesame oil) Koon Chung (Soy sauce - Hong Kong brand) Pearl River Bridge (Dark soy sauce w/ mushroom flavor)",
