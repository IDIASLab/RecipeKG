I put about a Tbsp of olive oil with rosemary and five unpeeled garlic cloves (I was afraid they would burn without the peel and they almost did anyway)on the bottom of the pan. Baked as directed. I used chipotle jam (no currant jelly) and added a bit of agave syrup for sweetness to the red wine mixture. The sauce really did add a nice flavor to the duck; I also added the drippings after I poured off the fat with rosemary to the sauce ummm ummm good! (Only problem was I used kosher salt on the duck and it was a bit too salty; stick to sea salt or use less next time.) Overall very good! Thank you for the recipe seattlelove.",
