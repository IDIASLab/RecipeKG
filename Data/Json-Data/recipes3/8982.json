I did these in batches and played around with the oil part to find out what worked best. I tried spraying with the spray oil (you really do have to coat) and drizzling with oil. these really need to be completely covered in oil so what seems to work best for me is drizzling but then flipping and moving around the oil until completely covered. A pain but better than frying and turns out delicious. I did double the spices and use seasoned salt; glad I did. thanks for the recipe!",
