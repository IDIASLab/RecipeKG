I used Barilla spicy marinara for the sauce and used tomatoes that had Italian seasonings. After the 20 minutes of simmering I ended up needing a bit more flavor (but to each their own right) I sprinkled in some ground coriander seed and a fat pinch of brown sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. Garnished with basil my family was pretty happy.",
