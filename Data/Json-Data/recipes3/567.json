I poured the ranch into a ziplock and threw the chicken in and shook it around and hit with a rolling pin a few times- the chicken came out very moist, and there was no mess from 'dipping' the chicken into the dressing. Will make again, even the picky husband loved it- took about 45-50 mins to bake.",

I use the cornflake crumbs or breadcrumbs but always add some garlic powder and occasionally dried oregano to the crumbs. I found that the crumbs will adhere beautifully if the chicken is just damp. A few tiny dabs of butter or margerine on top and bake 350 for 40-45 minutes. I never seem to find the chicken breasts with the wing attached these days but they are delicious that way.",
