He'd enjoy his with an ice cold beer and I'd enjoy mine with a tall glass of Kool Aid. This definitely is the classic gardener's relaxing meal as the submitter states.

Not only is it good with tomatoes something I don't even like all that much but it's also wonderful if you omit the tomatoes altogether and substitute them with sliced bell peppers (color of your choice) and just a bit of mustard along with the butter on the toasted bread and a thick slab of swiss cheese. It's wonderful on a warm night watching the sunset in swirling gold with an enormous jar of sweet tea between you and a loved one. Thanks so much. t.",
