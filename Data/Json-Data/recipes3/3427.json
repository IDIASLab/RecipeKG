I did modify the recipe a tad bit.  I didn't have garlic pepper as the recipe stated so I used garlic & herb seasoning, I also added garlic, and an extra egg because I was afraid it was going to dry out.  Instead of using an onion I used minced onion in a jar.  (Bill can explain this to everyone) I also added a little more bbq sauce and ketchup.  It was a little dry, but it was very tasty.  I recommend serving with gravy.  My picky 3 year old loved it.",
