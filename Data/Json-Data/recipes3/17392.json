I used penne & I only used 3/4 cup of olive oil and added 1 cup of white cooking (or house) wine or else it was too greasy. I also added in the oil from the jar of sun dried tomatoes for extra flavor (it's only about a tblsp full). I also rinsed and reused my pot after making the pasta. Used a little of my 3/4 cup of olive oil to brown my garlic and then added all of my other ingredients. Then added my pasta at the end. I didn't add any chicken this time but usually use shrimp instead. Every time I make this dish, it goes as quick as the wind! My fianc'e loves Macaroni Grill and they have something similar which led me to try to somewhat duplicate it. It does take some time to prep and can be a bit pricey to make but it is very well worth the time and money!! =)",
