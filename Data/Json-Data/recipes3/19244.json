When I made it as written the first time it was just too greasy for me. The reason I'm keeping the 5 stars is because of all the recipes I've tried from this website THIS is the recipe my family keeps asking me to make. It is simply delicious! Except for cutting the butter in half I keep the ingredients the same. I found that it bakes best covered in foil at 350 degress for the first 30 minutes. Then foil is removed and chicken is basted, basking for another 40 minutes or so until nicely browned. Served with roasted red new potatoes and mixed veggies. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!",

I also poked holes in the chicken and let it marinate in the sauce in the fridge for at least an hour before baking it, then put in the oven - 30 minutes covered with aluminum foil, then 20 minutes uncovered.

I made the following modifications based on other reviews and personal preference:\n\nI cut the butter to 1/4 cup, used spicy brown mustard, and upped the curry powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I also added one large clove of garlic, minced, a scant 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and half and onion sliced very thin.  I used chicken thighs, and there was enough sauce to do a dozen between two casserole dishes.  I coated them well and baked them covered at 350 degrees for an hour, turning halfway through.  I then removed the foil, basted them again, turned the oven up to 400, and baked them skin side up for an additional 20 minutes.  The skin got nice and brown and crisp.\n\nAfter baking, there was a lot of fat from the chicken.  I separated the fat and ended up with a nice sauce.  I served the chicken on a bed of long grain/wild rice topped with the sauce - which was really excellent on the rice.  The changes I made resulted in a mildly spicy background flavor that really complimented the sweetness of the honey mustard.  I highly recommend this recipe!",

As much as I hate people who completely change a recipe and then rate it I'm going to do just that. I make this with chicken breasts cut up into bite size pieces. Drop the amount of butter down to about a tablespoon and increase the curry powder to a tablespoon. Then I add dried fruit (apricots raisins and craisins are my favorite). Throw it in oven and bake it until the chicken is cooked. The mustard/curry/honey sauce gets all gooey and thick and is delicious over rice.",

Changes I made to the recipe: I skipped the butter - figured the chicken skin would impart enough oils during cooking. I used dijon mustard instead of yellow for a little more spicyness. Added a teaspoon of garam masala in addition to the curry. I also used a knife and cut little slits in the chicken to ensure more flavor would get into the chicken. Very good.. definitely a keeper! One thing I should mention is that I'm normally pressed for time in the evening so I made this in the morning and let the chicken and sauce sit in the fridge until I was ready to put in the oven - this marinating probably helps with the taste as well.",

                "reviewBody": "I'm giving this 3 out of 5 stars as written four stars with my changes. I used 6 good sized chicken thighs (with bone-in and skin on) which I parboiled for 15 minutes first. I only used 1/2 stick of melted butter since I was decreasing the amount of meat used but stayed with the 1/2 honey. I did up the amount of curry powder since a teaspoon is such a small amount for the mild curry I had on hand. I kept the salt in the recipe but did sprinkle some black pepper on at serving time. I am a fan of curry - all types and flavors from Indian to Irish. Don't expect a high powered spicy sort of curry with this dish unless you use one of the spicier curry blends (like African or Malaysian) that has more hot pepper flavor. With a mild yellow curry blend combined with the honey and mustard you will get a nice mellow curry dish. I sliced up some potatoes and carrots and baked them along with the thighs basting them and the meat every 15 minutes for one hour at 350. I did cover the pan with foil for the first half and then uncovered it which did the veggies a favor in their cooking but left the skin on the thighs slightly less crispy than I would have liked. This is one of those recipes that you should try and get creative with as there are so many things that you can do with the basic guidelines here.",
