This made a lot, but I came home with an empty bowl. :) Tweakings: 1. I began by using 10 avocados (because of the anticipated crowd) and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. 2. To stretch it, I blended the avocado with 2 8 oz. pkgs. cream cheese. 3. I used bottled lime juice concentrate, fresh squeezed orange juice and the syrup from a can of pineapple chunks. 4. I substituted a sprinkling of chili powder and some cayenne flakes for the cumin (personal preference). 5. Lastly, I added 2 Tbls. Worcestershire sauce. My intention was that my offering be used as a topping for the burgers, but some of the \"guests\" topped their hot dogs with it, too.",

So I tried it: first I made it exactly like the recipe and it was quite good (although yes a little bland). Then I tweaked it my way a little adding grapefruit juice (yum) tangerine juice (!) and crushed pineapple and replacing the hot pepper sauce with a heavy sprinkling of wasabi powder. I refrigerated it overnight and then used it as a sandwich spread. This was SO DELICIOUS! It won't replace my Super Bowl dip but it turned a simple sandwich into a gourmet meal. My luncheon guests loved it and I've got a new favorite in my recipe box!",
