Every time I take it to a potluck I get raves for it, and the recipe is always requested.  You may need to adjust the amount of mayo, depending on the size of the potatoes you use. You will use at least 2 cups, but may need to use a little more for a nice consistency.",

I left the eggs out because he has never been fond of hard boiled eggs but it still turned out really well. I just went a bit easier on the mayonaise. I did cut back on the paprika because of other suggestions and it still gave it a nice color and flavor. I think they were right about halfing the amount. I also used frozen salad shrimp (a whole bag) it was more than the recipe called for but due to the lack of eggs I figured I had room for some give. It turned out nice. I also added some chopped celery. You can alter this recipe to your tastes and it still turns out great. What more can you ask for?",

I read all of the reviews of this recipe took them all into account then ended up making the recipe exactly as written anyway and here's what I came up with. Yes there's alot of paprika but I like paprika and the odd color only adds intrigue. Yes there are alot off eggs and pickles and yes an abudence of celery salt and I'll give you that you don't really get a strong shrimp taste. But! Put all of those factors together throw 'em all in a bowl and add two (yes two) cups of mayo and you've got yourself a potato salad that's off-beat mysterious and strangely unimitable. At the end my guests were eating directly out of the bowl. Yum.",
