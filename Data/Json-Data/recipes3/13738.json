Made the sauce as instructed.  Layered as instructed.  Plenty of sauce for the extra pound of meat.  Pressure cooked 25 minutes as instructed.  Meat was tender enough to eat but not fall off the bone tender like I expected.  Put back in and pressured another 5 minutes.  Much better.  The flavor is very good but when I make this again using ribs with bones I will increase the pressure time by 10 minutes (35 total) and hope for more tenderness.  Overall, pretty good for my first attempt and not having the type of ribs recommended.  Will make this again.",
