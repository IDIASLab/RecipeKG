Otherwise superb!\" I scaled this back to 1 serving for my lunch and used torn baby spinach and romaine. My only complaint w/ it was the instructions saying to drizzle the EVOO balsamic vinegar and honey on before serving b/c inevitably my mouth ended up w/ a cloyingly-sweet honey bite or a too-tart vinegar bite. This would be 5 stars had I whisked the dressing together before adding it to the salad. But WOW! Such a simple mix of salad ingredients plus the pesto chicken - seriously tasty and something that I look forward to packing into my lunch for work.",
