I couldn't find any unsweetened coconut in the store so I just used the sweetened kind. And instead of using regular burger buns I got the Hawaiian rolls. I think the Hawaiian rolls made it all come together quite nice. The coconut flavor isn't overbearing at all. Its good for people that like coconut. But apparently the coconut flavor is present enough for people that don't like coconut at all to hate these burgers. But if you're a fan of coconut like me these burgers are a must-try.",

Reduce the salt to your taste but don't use less than 1/2 tsp. I always use low sodium soy sauce. If you are looking for extra lime flavor try adding lime zest. I hope you enjoy the recipe! And my motto is use my recipe as a base and make it your own:)",
