Mix an egg into a pound of ricotta to make it nice and creamy, and toss with the ziti. Layer sauce first (so you don't need to butter the pan), then ziti/cheese, mozzarella, sprinkle with parm and a little dried oregano or basil, then repeat layers. For a really nice look, slice a brick of mozzarella for the top layer instead of using the shredded kind. This is SO MUCH BETTER than the sour cream version!",

                "reviewBody": "Hey yo, what's up fellow cookers??  Check it...I hate when people give extraordinary recipes ratings that they don't deserve.  I sort my recipies by \"most helpful.\" Every person that I know who knows anything about cooking KNOWS to cover up whatever it is that they are baking so it won't dry up.  Now that I got that off my chest, I just want to say that this is definitely \"HALL OF FAME\" material.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe with the exception of how I layered it.  I read some of the other reviews and decided to put the sauce mixture directly on top of the ziti, then add the cheese, sour cream and so forth.  I even stirred the bottom layer of ziti and sauce together before I added anything else just to make sure that the sauce ran all through the noodles.  I may try Ricotta cheese next time just to see the difference in taste or may mix Ricotta with the sour cream. Grease the pan real well before you put anything in it....or just use a non-stick cooking spray.  If you like your meals cheesier, meatier or saucier, than you can add a little more, but that's strictly on your preference.  Oh yeah.......keep in mind that this meal does make a huge dish so you might want to have a smaller baking dish on the side for any extra that doesn't fit in the first one.  Better safe than sorry.....and trust...YOU WON'T BE SORRY FOR MAKING THIS AT ALL!!!!",

Instead of greasing the pan (I used a Pyrex dish) with butter, I sprayed a light coating of Pam; the pan was a breeze to clean afterward. Per some of the suggestions other reviewers made, I added minced garlic and had put the sauce directly on the ziti, before the provolone. Because I like the pasta to soak up the flavor of the sauce, I did the same for the top layer ziti, (adding the sauce to the ziti before the mozerella cheese). Since I wasn't sure if doing so would make the pasta too soft, I shaved a minute off of the suggested pasta boiling time. It came out perfect, this recipe is a keeper.",

If I could give this recipe more stars, I would, because it's also extremely flexible.  I've made this with Italian sausage or ground turkey instead of the beef.  I've also made a vegetarian version by substituting sliced zucchini and mushrooms for the meat.  Sometimes I add chopped garlic and fennel seed.  (There's something about fennel seed that, to me, is integral to Italian cooking.  It's like cilantro to Mexican food.)  Obviously, the key to the greatness of this recipe is the substitution of a layer of sour cream and provolone for the usual ricotta.  That's what makes the dish so moist and creamy.  Who hasn't make a beautiful lasagna only to have it dry out in the oven?  I like ricotta as much as the next Italian-American, but the stuff is pretty dry and really adds no flavor.  It's essentially just a binder.  Here, the combination of the provolone melting into the sour cream is truly inspired; the sour cream adds moisture and the provolone adds flavor.  I'm planning to use the same combo instead of ricotta in my next lasagna.  The importance of using a high-quality sauce for this recipe almost goes without saying, so I'll stop here.  Thanks, Colleen!",

Just made it again last night for friends (including 2 kids..who including the adults..went for seconds) and family.  This dish makes plenty of leftovers - pack them in tupperware and freeze for another night. Always a fantastic turnout with this dish!!\nDid make a few altercations though...as always:\nDidnt realize i picked up Penne pasta instead of Ziti at the store.  I omitted the onions. Used hot italian turkey sausage (squeezed the meat out of the casings and cooked it like you'd cook ground beef).  Seasoned the meat with pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Mrs Dash.  Added 2 TBS of minced garlic to browning meat.  Added 1 (drained) can of mushroom pieces with stems.  Added 2 jars of pasta sauce and let simmer for 15 mins.  Halved the amount of (reduced fat/light) sour cream and replaced it with (reduced fat/light) ricotta.  And used the rest of the ingredients off the recipe.  Layered PAM sprayed Pyrex baking dishes like so...Ziti, sauce, Provolone, Sour Cream, Ricotta, ziti, rest of sauce and Sargento's Italian 6 Shredded Cheese Blend - Mozzarella, Provolone, Asiago and Parmesan.  Covered with foil and baked for 30 mins.  :) Yummmmy \n**TIP**\nUnless you have a big family or are having company...i suggest if you are feeding up to 4 people to half the recipe. \nThanks Colleen for a great recipe!",

I add 1 TBSP of Italian seasoning, sliced mushrooms and sliced black olives to the sauce. I mix the pasta and meat sauce together, place half the mixture in the pan, then the sour cream and 1/2 of the cheese, then the remaining ziti mixture and top with the remaining cheese. I like the pasta completely coated with sauce. I use shredded Italian blend cheese and PILE it on, at least double what the recipe calls for, and increase the Parmesan as well. Definitely use 2 jars of sauce, it sounds like a lot but other wise the Ziti will be dry. This is perfect for a family gathering, it makes a lot.",

It still came out great, but it was difficult to spread the sour cream.  That was easily corrected by placing the sour cream in a zip lock bag, snipping a corner, and then evenly spreading it over the ingredients.  Everyone in my family loved it!",
