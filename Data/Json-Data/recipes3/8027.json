I'm giving it 5 stars even though I did things just a tad differently: I used Basa fillets (it was all I had) omitted the mozzarella cheese (although I might try Parmesan next time) and only added some lemon zest to the mayo. I also brushed some extra sauce onto the fillets and sprinkled with breadcrumbs before baking uncovered. Very delicious served with some rice and steamed broccoli. Who knew that imitation crab could make plain old fish so yummy! I will definitely be making this again:)",
