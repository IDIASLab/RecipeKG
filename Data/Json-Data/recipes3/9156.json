I only had dried parsley not fresh. Everything else I followed exactly. This was absolutely fantastic. I used Alfresco jalapeno chicken sausages and chopped them up into tiny pieces. The only thing missing is the recipe does not say how much water to use with a 1/2 cup of farro. Fortunately the package did (1 cup water to 1/2 cup farro). I found that I had to cook the mushrooms MUCH longer than 5 minutes more like 10-12. The flavors and textures were wonderful together. I normally refuse to eat spinach but wanted to stay as true to the recipe as I could. I would use the spinach next I cook this as well. This is definitely a weekend meal as it really does take about an hour start to finish. I was really surprised at how delicious it was!",
