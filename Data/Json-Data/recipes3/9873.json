If you don't have sriracha, don't worry you can use another type of hot sauce.  I had originally put the srirache as \"adjust to taste\" but it does not appear to have made it in the recipe.  If you have fresh ginger and garlic, by all means use fresh.  Give it a try!",

Mixed them up in the morning and formed the patties to let the flavors meld. Before grilling I put a hole in the center of the meat so the burger (85/15%) would not shrink up. It worked like a charm and the burger grilled to the same size as the bun. Ten minutes per side was the perfect timing on our grill. Saveur another AR member suggested this burger and I'm so glad I saved it. The burgers were served with 'Mad Hatter Salad' from AR and fresh fruit. It is an Asian based salad. It went really with the burgers. Occasional Cooker you have another award winning recipe to add to your collection. Thanks for sharing.",

I made this recipe as written except I didn't have hoisin sauce so I made my own using a recipe from the Internet. And I omitted the red pepper flakes because I'm very wimpy when it comes to spicy food. But I used the full amount of Sriracha sauce. I mixed the ingredients together formed the patties and chilled it for about 4 hours before grilling so that the meat could soak in all the lovely flavors! These burgers were so moist and delicious! Thanks OC for this fabulous burger recipe that I will use often!",
