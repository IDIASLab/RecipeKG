I subbed  a 12 oz can (1 1/2 cup) evaporated milk in its place. To keep my flour from getting lumpy I used a small container and shook the flour and 1/2 cup of the milk together until dissolved.  Added the milk to the mixture, then the flour/milk to the pan.  Make sure you stir the mixture frequently so it does not burn in the bottom of the pan.  The evaporated milk really gave the soup body and additional flavor!!  It thickened up a little more than I like so I added an *additional* 1/2 cup of broth.  I topped with diced ham instead of bacon.  ",

The addition of the vinegar seemed a little strange but I think it is an essential part of why this soup tastes so good! I did add a bit more seasoning--some ground pepper and garlic powder. Like one of the other reviewers I also used a potato masher to mash up some of the potatoes for an even creamier soup. In addition to serving the soup with the cheese and bacon I also sprinkled some chopped green onion on top. A deliciously hearty soup!",
