I used only 3 eggs and used scallions instead of onions.  Also, my zucchini was shredded not diced because I had extra shredded zucchini from zucchini bread I was baking.  And I used half a cup of clam juice with half a cup of milk.  Sorry, I know these changes might affect the results so I plan to make this exactly next time.  I just had to say thank you for a great recipe. UPDATE: yep, made it again this week and this time followed the recipe to a \"T\" (well, almost, I still had to use shredded zucchini because husband hates zucchini so I have to make it as invincible as possible) but boy, was it good.  I made this twice in one week so I think that speaks volumes.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.",
