Taste wise I would give them at least a 4. However they are very GREASY! Plus they are not only time-consuming to make but very messy! The patties did not want to hold together at all. I am going to blaim that on the zucchini I had. I had to squeeze a lot of water out of it which I had never had to do before. The other recipes use 1-2 Tblsp or butter or oil. The patties hold together on their own. I found the dipping the patty in flour before cooking a little tedious. The flour mixture or more eggs should have went into the bowl to hold them together. I got one good batch but I may not even try making the rest as they are a pain. Unless I can figure some way to thicken the batter which I may finally do. Hopefully I will also be able to use less oil than also.",
