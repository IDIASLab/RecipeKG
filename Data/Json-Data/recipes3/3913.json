I did make some modifications: I first cooked the onions for a few minutes then added minced garlic (instead of using garlic powder) and cooked that for a few minutes. To add some more vegetables (and color) to the casserole I added diced carrots green bell peppers and celery while the onions were cooking - and then added the meat to cook. I also used ground turkey instead of beef. I may consider adding peas next time I make this. I did not add sliced mushrooms since no one in our family likes them and I used 99% fat free soups. I also added some italian seasoning on top of the salt and pepper. Finally as others suggested I used sharp cheddar cheese. My husband had three helpings and asked me to add it to our regular rotation!",
