I'm doing the DIET thing so I use boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Also it doesn't need the butter or the wine.  I put all the dry ingredients into a ziplock bag and with one clean hand sprinkle this mixture on the chicken, flipping it and padding it in with your BAD (chicken) hand.  I then put the ziplock bag into the fridge for next weeks dinner, I can actually get several meals out of one recipe.  Bake at 350 for 45min or until done.  Also use the powdered like parmesan cheese that you find in the isle not in the fridge. It sticks to the chicken better then the grated parmesan that is truly grated into little strips.",
