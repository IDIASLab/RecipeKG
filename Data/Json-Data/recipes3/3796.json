I used yellow whole kernel corn since I didnt' have any white corn on hand and used cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have any cream of celery. Added a jar of canned mushooms and used French's fried onions on top instead of the crackers because my daughter loves them. Omitted the slivered almonds. Everybody loved this casserole. Thanks for the great recipe Aprilynne!",

I used yellow corn and also added some fresh mushroom slices, diced zucchini and yellow squash that I needed to use in something. I also had to sub the cream of celery soup to cream of mushroom b/c that's what I had on hand. We are very much looking forward to the leftovers tonight. Thanks for the wonderful idea!!!",
