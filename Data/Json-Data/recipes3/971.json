It's not a difficult recipe, but just be careful to melt everything together on LOW heat or your chocolate might burn, and stir constantly or it might separate (but it seems to be impossible to ruin)!  Have all your ingredients nearby and measured before you begin.  Also, 1/4 cup *strong* coffee will work if you don't have instant.

I understand why a reviewer would say it was better the next day because then the flavors would have a chance to meld, however this pie won't make it that long in this house.  I recommend using the \"Flaky Food Processor Pie Crust\" on this website - that is also excellent.  I am trying new recipes all the time, (which is why my husband has two gym memberships and goes  twice a day) and this is one of the best  recipes I've found in quite some time.

Today, after it sat overnight in the fridge, I had a hankering for chocolate and thought, heck, let's eat this mocha pie already.  Five-stars today!  When served chilled, the texture changes considerably into a mousse-like consistency that melts in your mouth.  The nuts add just enough pleasant crunch and the coffee flavor is much more subtle.  A perfect blend.  I made the following changes to the recipe:  I substituted 3 TBS unsweetened cocoa powder for the 1 oz of unsweetened chocolate.  Instead of a pastry crust, I layered the bottom of a cake pan with graham cracker crust to a depth of 1/2\" and poured the pie batter on top of that.  This made the pie come out easily as a torte and made a nice display for the table.  Definitely something I'd make again--if I let it sit overnight before serving.",
