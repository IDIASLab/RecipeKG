I made one yesterday for the first time and a hint would be to get the rawest deli roastbeef and have them shave the meat at .04 on the slicer.  I can't get a really good cheesesteak where I live now in AZ, so I got going on my own and it came out great.  I carmelized onions, charred a red and yellow pepper.  Incorporated the prepared onion/peppers with the pan-fried shaved steak, topped with white american and it was delicious.  I will probably expand with pepper rings and different cheeses but this one was great on a sub roll.",

I bought \"chip steak\" which is basically sirloin cut paper thin. It cooks in no time at all! I cut my onions and peppers lengthwise and lighty toasted my steak rolls under the broiler before piling on the ooey gooey meat and cheese mixture. Nice recipe that's perfect for a quick weeknight meal. Goes great with kettle cooked chips and an ice cold beer!",
