I used Sun Dried Tomatoe sauce and garlic tomatoe paste a little brown sugar some hot sauce lots of garlic ect. I didn't mix all the cheeses/sour cream in to the meat mixture because that sounded a little yucky to me. Instead I assembled it like you would lasagna with a layer of the cheese mixture all on it's own. So for that I didn't actually measure the cheeses or sour cream. Just threw what I thought would be good in a bowl and stired it up. I also added half each of a yellow and red pepper and about 1 cup of grated aged cheddar cheese. I then in a greased casserole dish put half the noodles all the cheese mixture half the meat sauce remaining noodles remaining meat suuce and finally topped it all off with some more grated cheddar and a sprinkle of parm. Yumm!!! Loved this at least the way I made it. It's a great idea just play with it to make it the likes of your family. Thanx for this great idea though!:)",
