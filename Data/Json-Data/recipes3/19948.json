I hope this will help someone in a bind or in a hurry. First I shred chicken from a rotisserie chicken. Then for the filling I take salsa and strain out all the liquid and add the \u201cdry salsa\u201d to the chicken> I probably strain a cup to a cup and half. I also chop half of an onion and add that in. Then for the sauce I prefer just mixing the sour cream and jalapeno salsa. Spoon the chicken mixture into flour tortillas. Pour a little sauce into the pan then your enchiladas and the rest of the sauce on top and lots of Mexican blend cheese. This is my quick and easy version of this recipe! It tastes so, so good. I garnish with shredded lettuce, fresh tomatoes, and guacamole. Yum! Yum!",

Bring to boil, then simmer 20-35 mins (longer for large bone-in). Discard onion and garlic, reserve flavorful broth for something else, set chicken aside to cool. When cool enough, the chicken will pull apart easily and it's a great way of quickly preparing flavorful, very moist chicken that doesn't dry out.\r\n\r\n... ASLO, WARNING - before you dump a jar of salsa in with your sour cream and cilantro, give it a taste. Salsa can be \"off\", as in sour/bad - even if it's been in an air-tight jar (this has happened to me), or the brand/heat level may not be to your liking. The flavor of the salsa will determine whether you like this recipe or not.",

I through the entire bunch of cilantro into the blender for the best flavor (stems and all), and have used green enchilada sauce, green salsa, and jalapeno salsa for all 28 ounces of the salsa. I have found that the flavor is a bit different, but always good no matter what I use. I have also used mozarella cheese, monteray jack, or cheddar, and it tastes good with each! To SHRED THE CHICKEN, boil a few breasts in water with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder (or plain is fine too) for about 20 minutes if thawed, longer if frozen, and use either 2 forks or fingers to shred it up. You can just cut up a chicken and use chunks, too. We love this recipe, and the kids like it too, as long as I keep my green salsa mild. Have fun! You can do lots with this recipe and it still tastes good!!!",

The only change I made was to use Herdez brand salsa Mexicana in place of the jalapeno salsa and it still provided plenty of heat. The sauce is definitely what makes this dish I even kept a little aside to use as a dip with tortilla chips. My (and husband's) only complaint is that the onion in the filling was still crunchy after baking so I'd leave that out or maybe use green onions.",

I may try these again w/ corn torts and come back to change the number of stars. Also I think Jack cheese would be far better.",
