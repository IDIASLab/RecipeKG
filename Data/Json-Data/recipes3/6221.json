I made a couple of little modifications: I used sourdough croutons (I crushed them up into crumbs) instead of regular bread crumbs I sauteed some fresh chopped garlic (1 clove) with the onion and chard added a dash more nutmeg and added about 1/3 cup of crumbled feta cheese on top of quiche 5 mins. before removing from oven- absolutely delicious!

I skipped the first two steps because I used a pre-made pie dough and good quality canned salmon (this cut out some time and work). I also used more swiss chard and less salmon because that is what I had on hand. I used olive oil in place of the butter and Almond milk in place of the milk to make this non-dairy. It turned out wonderful and I have made it several times! I also use the core part of this recipe (3 eggs to 1 cup milk in a pie shell) to use up just about any left over veggies. If you have the pre-made rolled pie dough on hand the prep part of this dinner is done in just minutes!",

We doubled the recipe (making one to freeze) and only needed about 3 cups of milk (not 4). (See how later in the recipe you only use part of the milk again.) It could use a little salt when you stir in the eggs and milk. We made it in a whole wheat pie crust (so we didn't use the bread crumbs) baking it 7 min longer than the directions. Wonderful wonderful! Thanks for such a great recipe!",
