I left the margarine and pepper flake amounts as-is, and used half an onion.  (I almost always reduce onion amounts.) I  didn't have enough sour cream, so I used cream cheese to make up the deficit; and I used butter in place of margarine. || Even with these pantry and taste accommodations, this recipe was AMAZING, with a light, balanced flavor. It was a huge hit at the potluck, and I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!",
