I also added more cheese than was called for.\nThe \"impossible pies\" from the back of the box call for 2/3 c mix, 3/4 c milk and 2 eggs - so that's the topping that I used.\nI've made this 1000 times with 1000 different fillings - any cheese wotrks, most any veggie in most any combo.  It's also good with chopped cooked meats!  This is a terrific basic \"starter\".  Thanks!",

I then added the parmesan cheese, the spices I put in are: paprika for colour, fresh parsley, celery salt, onion powder and black pepper.  The smell is heavenly when it's baking!  I sprinkled some grated cheese on the top for the finishing touch!  Great hit with my family!",
