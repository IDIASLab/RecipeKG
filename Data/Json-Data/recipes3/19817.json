The secret? You need to MARINATE in the liquid for at least an hour, but this can still be a last-minute recipe if you do what I do.  When I come home from the store after having purchased my meat, I immediately divide portions into zip lock bags, add the seasonings (and yes, ANY oil based salad dressing works, as well as any seasonings that you feel will compliment the flavor you are going for!!), and then stick in the freezer until I'm ready to cook the meal at which time I simply defrost. This is the fool proof way to bake (or grill) chicken breasts. I promise you will ALWAYS get rave reviews if this is followed. My husband's personal favorite is an oil based greek dressing with a sprig or two of fresh rosemary in the freezer bag. When grilled, it is fragrant, crispy, juicy and tender! Use your imagination to come up with your own signature dish. Yummy!",

The key to this recipe is the SEASON TO TASTE line.  If you don't add seasoning to it you will possibly find it bland. I put garlic in the olive oil, then seasoned with garlic powder, salt, pepper and a little dried thyme.  I only had 1/2 cup of Worcestershire and it could have used the full amount to my taste.  The chicken was moist but cooked faster than the recipe called for.  I thought it was pretty good but the kids really provided the rating for this one.",

And then I sprinkled the worchestershire sauce all over it. I'm not sure I actually did 3/4 cup. And before I put it in the oven I added about 3/4 to 1 c. water because I wanted extra drippings. It was great. and my husband LOVED it. It was a little spicier than I thought it would be (a good thing for us but I know people who would have thought it was too much). When it was done cooking I just poured all those drippings into a little sauce pan w/ flour and water and it made a WONDERFUL gravy. And since it was just out of the over it only took about 2 minutes to make. My 4 year old sat w/ the leftover gravy and ate every bit of it. took the idea of another and served it over instant rice. It was a really quick and easy meal.",

I cut up a whole chicken covered the chicken for the first 45 minutes then turned the pieces and cooked them uncovered for another 10 minutes then covered them again for 10 minutes when I took them out of the oven.
