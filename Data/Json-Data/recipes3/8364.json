I wasn't really planning on using the technique for pork chops again, but I got these super thick pork chops from Costco and I figured that if I didn't brine them there was no way that they wouldn't be at least a little dry. So I found this recipe and went for it. I used Heineken, and apple cider vinegar instead of red wine. I used half Dijon and half Stone Ground Mustard. I ended up not cooking  these when I thought I was going to, and after 24 hours I was worried about over brining them, so I pulled them out of the brine and basted them with BBQ sauce, then cooked them the next evening. They were fantastic, SO moist and flavorful. The brine really kept them juicy. I have more of these chops in the freezer (like I said, Costco special) and I plan on using this brine a lot more in the future! Great Recipe!",
