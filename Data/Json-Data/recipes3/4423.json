I end up having to use a little extra flour because I make this with 1% milk, which is what I normally buy. OH - ONE OTHER THING: The most popular review states that he whisks the milk & flour together & adds it to the sausage directly. The reason the recipe is written the way it is - is because you need to cook the flour in the drippings & butter to get rid of the \"floury\" taste. All successful white sauces are made this way. Following the original recipe as written makes the best tasting gravy!",

I add about 4 Tablespoons of maple syrup after it thickens and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper OR replace maple sausage with chorizo sausage to make it spicy....but you can add either to your liking, I just found that it makes the flavor burst!  Also, I serve mine over buttermilk biscuits...the only way to eat them!  Thanks Bill!",
