The recipe ingredients have been scaled to 1/2 the original and it is stuck at that serving modification but the instructions are for the original yield of 24 (2 dozen - see intro text under \"submitted by\"). So, of course half the ingredients would not really work in a 13x9\" pan. Either bake the current modified version in a 9x9\" or 8x8\" pan or double the ingredients and bake in a 13x9\" pan. They are good!! I would recommend pressing the butter/cracker mix down into the pan. I used fat free saltines and fat free s.cond.milk and pecans instead of walnuts with good success as well.",

I took the advice of others and increased the soda cracker crumbs to 1 1/2 cups and kept the butter at 1/2 cup. I think it created just the right amount of crust. Since I used salted crackers and salted butter the flavor of the crust was just right too. Because our family doesn't like super-sweet desserts I used unsweetened flaked coconut (which you can purchase at a health food store or in the grain-cereal section of a supermarket). We tried the recipe twice once with the semisweet chocolate chips and walnuts and the other time with milk chocolate chips and pecans using the same measurements. Both tasted great. Thanks for a delicious recipe!",

You could use any type of crackers for the crust(well probably not onion or garlic-flavored crackers!)and the rest of the ingredients may be swapped out. For example I used soda crackers toffee bits semi-sweet chips and a sturdy cup of pecans. I melted the butter in the pan while the oven was heating up then just mixed in the crackers and pressed down the crust. I omitted the coconut due to family allergies and they STILL came out fabulous! Thank you so very much for this recipe!",
