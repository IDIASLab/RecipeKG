Here's a little tip that everyone loves.  Freeze the remaining 1/2 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  At the end of stirring, pour in the frozen chocolate chips, give the mix one good, quick, final stir, pour into pan and refrigerate.  (I like it cold!)  The mixture is hot enough to melt part, but not all, of the frozen chips.  It will leave tiny chocolate chunks throughout.  Want another tip?  After preparing as I did above, add one cup of peanut butter to this recipe before the final stirring and refrigerate.  Mmmm!!  (If adding the frozen chocolate chips, always add them last to prevent them from melting totally.)  Having trouble getting it out of the pan?  Line the pan with foil.  After it sets, simply lift it out, remove the foil, and place the fudge on a dish or cutting surface to cut.  ",

My family's favorite varieties are peanuts & raisins peanuts & marshmallows oreos & white chocolate and white chocolate & crushed peppermint. Mix in the candies at the end and then refrigerate. One more thing. Rachel Ray was on Oprah recently and she made a recipe like this one but she made it in the shape of a wreath. I tried it that way (used a jello mold) and it came out fabulous!
