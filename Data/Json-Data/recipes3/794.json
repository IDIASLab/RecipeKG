If these don't sastify your chocolate craving there is something wrong with you! As far as the directions go you really can't whisk in the cake mix very well as the pudding and cake mix gets really thick. You also aren't \"pouring\" the batter into the pan. The batter is so thick you have to scrape it out of the bowl. Do NOT make these in a 9 x 13 pan as they come out way too thick.",

Brownie batter doesn't need to be more than 1/2 inch deep in the pan. I probably could have gotten away with two 13x9's. I used a devil's food cake mix because I didn't have a regular chocolate mix on hand and I only baked the two pans of brownies for 18 minutes. They came out nice and fudgy but next time I might shorten the baking time by another 2-3 minutes to keep them even more moist. This batter (uncooked) would also be great frozen and chopped into pieces then stirred into a fresh batch of homemade ice cream.",
