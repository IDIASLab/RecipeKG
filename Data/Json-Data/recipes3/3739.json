Being someone who likes my Bloody Marys spicy I made sure to add a generous amount of horseradish to a store-bought mix before pouring it over the filets. We served it with rice pilaf and a nice buttery Chardonay. Unfortunately we had no fresh greens in the house but I'm sure asparagus with go great with it. Only suggestion we marinated the fish for almost an hour and it wasn't really enough time to allow the spicy flavor to permeate the salmon -- I would recommend a much longer marinating period maybe over night. Thanks for the great recipe!",

When I tried this one I used an \"extra spicy\" bloody mary mix and very thinly cut some shallots to single layer on top of the filets while I baked them. Came out superb. Definitely marinate these for as long as humanly possible -- mine were done for about 10 hours and I could see letting them go for double that time in the future.",
