Second i used less tomato sauce and did 8 oz of sauce w 1 tomato diced. Cooked ground meat drained did \"rice\" solo using EVOO and some of the remaining meat fat. Maybe 5 minutes sauteed total. Added back the meat and all the other ingredients for maybe an extra 2 min. I did stick w their seasoning recommendations and felt it was under seasoned. Also i regret not using more tomato sauce. Good! Would make again and dont regret not using their frozen stuff but thats why I didnt give it a full 5 stars (because i didnt follow the reciepe that closely!) But figured maybe this could help others",
