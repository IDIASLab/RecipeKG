The meat was a little wet and difficult when I was forming the \"legs\" so I added some breadcrumbs to the mix. Worked perfectly. Teenage boys 3yr old and 1yr old all loved it. I only had ground veal no pork. Was very good.",

                "reviewBody": "Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I grew up in Cleveland s suburbs and your City Chicken recipe was the only one I ever had. The tender ground meats shaped into perfect drumsticks sometimes refrigerated overnight in a coat of home made breadcrumbs and eggs. Well there was nothing like it. My sister and I would hang out in the kitchen waiting for the scrumptious legs to drip and cool enough for us to grab the first ones. I admit we never used crushed pineapple and we used veal a tiny bit of ground chicken and a tiny bit of ground round. So I decided to try your recipe exactly as written. It was delicious and better than my childhood memories. Next time I m doubling the recipe so we have more than one meal. Thank you for this genuine gift. Every City Chicken recipe I came across was Pittsburgh style meaning chunks of pork arranged on a skewer. Your recipe is the real deal and one I plan to make again and again. Yummmmmm!",
