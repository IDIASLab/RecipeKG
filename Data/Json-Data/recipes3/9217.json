It was a big hit for all of us, though I did add a little more avocado because my two youngest are huge avocado fans.  We also did not add any salt, just a little black pepper, and it had plenty of kick for our group.  :-)  We didn't use the Boston lettuce because we can't get that locally but Romaine worked just fine.  I was using frozen uncooked shrimp so I saut\u00e9ed them with a little butter just before adding them to the recipe, and the warm shrimp were great in this recipe.  There's probably a lot more experimenting we'll try with this basic recipe, thanks!",
