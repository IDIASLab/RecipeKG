I used a fork to seal the edges since the bottom crust was already slightly cooked so had to press down harder. It cooked up nicely and my family liked it.",

My husband does not enjoy \u2018meatless\u2019 meals and he commented twice that this was a good dinner.  To me, I heard \u201cOh, yea, you can make this one again!\u201d  I didn\u2019t have quite a pound of broccoli, so I roughly chopped an onion and added it to the last 5 minutes of the boiling potatoes.  That worked perfectly.  I used two Pillsbury\u00ae Pizza Crusts and spread it out to the edges on a large pizza (16\u201d) pan.  I debated pre-baking the bottom crust, but chose not to and the bottom crust baked up just fine.  I did not have Monterey Jack cheese, but did have Pepperjack Cheese, so I used 2 cups of it in this recipe.  This made a very big pizza \u2013 and I cut 8 very large pieces.  This was served with \u2018Marilyn\u2019s Special Salad\u2019 from AR, and we had a very enjoyable dinner.",
