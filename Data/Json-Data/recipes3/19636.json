I placed them in a baking bag.  I mixed the oil and soup mix (Lipton Herb & Garlic) together, then put about 3 tsp of the mix into the bag and shook it up.  I baked the potatoes for 15 minutes while I cut up the other veggies.  I left out the zucchini and added onion wedges.  I took the bag out of the oven and added the rest of the veggies and the oil/soup mix and shook it up good.  Baked for another 30 minutes.  It was excellent!  Potatoes and carrots were nice and soft.  Leave out the salt, you don't need it.  I can't wait to wrap these veggies in tin foil and throw them on the grill!  Thanks for the recipe!",

For our great results, we did this: mixed the olive oil and soup mix together first; tossed the potatoes with a small portion of the mixture and started them cooking; tossed the rest of the veggies with the mix and added them to the potatoes after 15 minutes; cooked them all another 40 minutes (but could have pulled them out at 30 minutes). Also, we added small, whole mushrooms, which we all love. We doubled this recipe to serve 7 people; everyone had their fill plus second helpings, and there were about 3 servings left over. My kids aren't crazy about vegetables, but they ate this and said it tasted like it was hot off the grill! All the adults loved it.",

So has to be changed.\" Before delving into the reviews it was obvious that if prepared as the recipe was submitted you'd end up w/ pebble-hard potatoes disintegrating zucchini and broccoli smoosh. I used the ratio of ingredients as listed but I steamed the potatoes and carrots briefly in the microwave 1st then tossed everything in the pan w/ the EVOO and onion soup. After about 40 min. the texture of the veggies was spot-on the taste was pretty good but the color was dingy due to the soup powder. I served the veggies w/ a little grated parm which was nice and perhaps if I make this again I'd bake it w/ parm (as well as some paprika and garlic) mixed in. This recipe definitely can't be rated highly as written and due to all of the reviewers also making changes to the prep I hover around a 3.5",
