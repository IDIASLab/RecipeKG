Added 1/2 tsp. dried oregano as other reviewers suggested (thank you) and fresh chopped parsley to the mix.  Left out the bread crumbs because didn't use lamb which adds more liquid (oil) to the mix.  Was afraid they would be too dry using ground sirloin only.  They were not at all dry.  Mixed it up this afternoon and let it set for a few hours for the flavors to blend.  Tasted much like gyro meat.  Served in warmed onion pitas w/red onion slices, diced fresh tomatoes, and tziziki sauce.  Thanks LatinaCook for the photo submission, as well.",

If our family disagrees about it being 5-stars... it still turned out to be a decent dish (just not our thing). Please consider a different Gyro recipe. I'll report back when I've discovered a better one but this doesn't taste like gyros at all esp. if you're spoiled and have a good restaurant near you. I'm VERY easy to please and my husband... not so much. Either way we both didn't want to eat this. Followed the recipe exactly and even included the sauce people recommended. FWIW the sauce tastes better w/o blending it. Blending it makes it too thin.",
