I followed the recipe as written except for using 1 1/2 pound of shrimp and took the advice of previous reviews to just top with the mozzarella cheese. The shrimp marinade is excellent and could be used alone for anytime you want to grill shrimp I did marinate it a couple of hours. The sauce was also good without the mozzarella cheese seemed thin but once the tomatoes and noodles added it was just right. We enjoyed this dish and will probably make it again. We grilled some zucchini and that was so good mixed in with this dish that I might make that way next time. The reason for four stars is the order of the directions will have you in a real mess. The shrimp was the last thing we cooked and thanks to another review I had everything ready including the sauce. So we weren't scurrying around the kitchen trying to hurry everything up.",

I think that just a sprinkle of mozzarella on the top of each serving would be sufficient. It would also help to have one person grilling and the other making the rest of the dish. Shrimp cooks very fast and cannot be left alone - the sauce etc.... needs attention too making this recipe was like a race. If making this for company I would make the sauce in advance and keep in warm in a double boiler or enlist the help of someone you can trust to grill the shrimp.",

I just topped each serving w/ some shredded mozzarella instead of adding it to the sauce after reading the other reviews and for the fact that I have no luck adding shredded cheeses to sauces they always end up clumpy and stringy for me. Oh also hubby is not a fan of angel hair so I used spaghetti. I LOVED the addition of the wine in the alfredo sauce! The shrimp had fantastic flavor and I would totally just make shrimp like that even if I was not making this pasta. I did allow my shrimp to marinate about 5 hours or so. All in all this was very flavorful and I will def be making it again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

Shrimp only need an hour or so to marinate so pre-prep the shrimp by pealing cleaning & deveining the night before you plan to serve? Put aside until next day in the refrigerator. Also make up the marinade the night before & keep separate in refrigerator until next afternoon. marinate for one hour or so. Since Shrimp only need an hour or so to marinate & just a minute or so to cook so be sure to have pasta almost perfectly cooked & drained just right seconds before you plan to plate & serve the fisnished meal. As far as the problems with cheese becoming gloppy remember the adage when working with cheese heat it \"slow & at LOW temperature so cool freshly plated dishes with cheese doesn't get too quickly hot.
