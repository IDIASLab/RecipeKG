It's not something you'll see everywhere and it's easy (if you use a processor for shredding the cabbage) and surprisingly delicious. We ate this with fresh grilled brats pickled eggs beer and German potato pancakes (from this site). Since the bacon is crumbled I used bacon end pieces which are considerably cheaper than regular bacon. I also used white wine vinegar because that's what I had. With the high fat content of everything on the menu smaller portions came naturally were enjoyed and satisfying. For something unusual for your guests this one is a winner!",
