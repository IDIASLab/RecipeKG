                "reviewBody": "Tasted amazing! I wanted to post a review to add a few tips for the few people that this recipe did not work for. It would be a shame to set it in the toss pile and never attempt it again.  1) The dough is delicate, I used my kitchen aid dough hook, but when the dough got a bit sticky I added about 1/2 cup of flour 2) When you are rolling out on the counter, be liberal with the flour on the counter and on the dough surface  3) When you cut your rounds, make the dough a little thicker (when you add the filling, you will stretch out the dough a little more) 4) flour your rounds on both sides and stack them on a plate, if you refrigerate your rounds for a few hours they will be easy to work with.  5) Make sure your filling has no juice! If you use the sauerkraut recipe add a bit of mashed potato to pull it together and drain and fry the sauerkraut for a few mins to boil away all of the leftover juice.  6) When making the mashed potatoes it helps to almost over whip them so they start to become a bit \"gummy\", not too much, but enough so you can make balls out of the mixture 7) If the pierogi \"looks\" sealed but you didn't fold it over or use a fork to bind it, it will probably come apart in the boiling water.  8) drop the pierogi's 1 at a time into the boiling water so they cook for a few seconds before the next is dropped in, this stops them from sticking together, I found that 2 mins of boiling was sufficient, and I fried them after.  These turned out perfect!!",
