In a separate bowl I mixed together 1 T honey 5T apple butter and 1/3c brown sugar(or coconut sugar)with 1 egg and 1/4c butter. Then I added the 1t vanilla and zest of 2 oranges. Then mix the dry and wet ingredients together. Then stir in 1/3c 1 or 2T of rolled oats. Then bake on greased cookie sheets for 11-13 minutes. The ginger and orange flavor are amazing!",
