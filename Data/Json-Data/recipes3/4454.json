This is something I'd expect to find in gourmet delis for a bazillion ridiculous dollars a pound. It lends an elegant, unique touch to the table and wakes up the same old cook-out.  It would be terrific  just as is, but because I have a bunch of stuff in the fridge I want to use I added red, yellow and orange bell pepper, which made this look very festive.  For my own personal tastes I changed the white vinegar to 1 T. each of white wine vinegar and lemon juice - I don't like a particularly tangy dressing.  I also gave it a couple of shakes of Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning and a drizzle of white truffle oil.  I so dislike this expression, but I have to say it - this is a keeper.",
