First three serrano peppers is a LOT of peppers particular if they happen to be really hot (mine were) - so I significantly cut back on them so that they acted more as seasoning and I filled the gap with green bell pepper. Vegetable oil didn't appeal to me nor did the ratio of vinegar to oil. I used olive oil and white wine vinegar in a ratio of 3:1 instead. Finally salt alone was not enough to season this but again it was easy enough to add some cumin and garlic powder. Kind of blah and too tangy as written excellent (five stars in my view!) with a little tinkering.",
