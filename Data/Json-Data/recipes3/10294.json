The change I made was I added water to the mix as there was no juice and it would have burned without the moisture (by the time it was ready the water was all gone). Next time I will not use the oven and will make the meat/veggie mixture in the same pot I am going to put the beans/spices in. The bacon never got crispy in the oven and it was just another pot to clean. Also I didn't have fresh bell pepper so used the tri color frozen peppers and I didn't have fresh jalapeno and used dried.",
