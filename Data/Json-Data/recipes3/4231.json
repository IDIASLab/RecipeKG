I added a clove of minced garlic to the sauteed onions to give the dish a little pizzaz. 1/2 cup of creme fraiche isn't enough for all that pasta; I used 1 full cup AND 1/4 cup sour cream. A little shredded cheddar cheese might also be a good addition. Overall this recipe has a nice presentation and texture but the flavor is quite unremarkable.",

I used about 1 1/4 cup creme fraiche based on the prior reviews and I loved the subtlety of the creme fraiche with the ham and broccoli. I also added about 1.5 cups of fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauteed onions for another flavor element but I think it would be good without.",
