Unlike most similar recipes, this one is made without soy sauce and with totally fresh ingredients. The result is a bright, fresh fish with great taste and texture. The fresh ingredients are the star here: Don't substitute with dried, powdered, or frozen ingredients! I served on top of rice and steamed broccoli garnished with green onions.",

I was expecting a bit more flavor after marinating for 2 hours, but next time I would take the cook's suggestion to make extra sauce and reduce it down to serve over the cooked salmon. I found this needed a sprinkle of salt before serving, but other than that, a great way to prepare salmon, especially for those who love eating the crispy skin.  9 minutes was perfect for 1-inch thick center-cut filets, with the last minute under the broiler to help crisp up and brown the tops.",
