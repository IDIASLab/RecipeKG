This needed a little more personalization to make it more potato-salad-y than just mashed potatoes with cheese and eggs. I added three very large chopped celery ribs some chopped garlic dills a bunch of chopped green onion some crumbed crisp bacon a tablespoon or so of dijon a litle Frank's Hot Sauce and some spices (onion powder garlic powder chopped chives). We don't use Miracle Whip so I just substituted Hellman's. It's always good to use less liquid (sour cream/mayonnaise) than what's called for and just add as you go. This way it's neither too wet or dry. We enjoyed it. Honestly I think we like the texture of a roughly mashed potato salad than a chunk to be honest. It just tastes better that way.",

I told them to let it blend all night and try it again if it wasn t to their liking I would doctor it up. Twenty four hours later I found myself adding 3 extra eggs cup of diced onion and 2 stalks of celery. Three stars as written and 4 stars with the added ingredients.",
