Madras curry powder and some cayenne pepper to kick it up as I like my curries fairly spicy.  I found the sauce to be a bit thin so I thickened it up by using a cornstarch slurry.  After making these adjustments, this curry turned out great.  Will be making it again and perhaps next time will add a few vegetables to the mixture.  I served this for dinner last night over basmati rice and with store-bought naan which I brushed with melted butter, sprinkled with minced garlic and baked on a sheet pan for 4 min. at 400 degrees.  The only thing I wish I had to go with this meal was some mint chutney, which I will be sure to have next time I serve this.",

The only changes I made were that I used chopped fresh tomatoes and I added a chopped serano pepper because we like heat. Also I use 2 lbs of raw peeled shrimp. It cooks in the sauce in about 5 minutes. I think cooked shrimp would be too tough and not take on the flavor of all the spices as much.",

I made it vegetarian by sauteing 2 cups of mushrooms with the onions, then adding 1 cup frozen green peas at the point where you would add shrimp.  I also wanted a sweeter flavor and used a can of stewed tomatoes that I chopped up. Served it over rice and it was scrumptious.  For an elegant look you can press a serving of rice into a small rounded bowl and then \"flip \" the bowl to empty it intact onto your serving dish Then ladle the curry mix around the rice, and adorn the rice mound with a piece of cilantro... gorgeous.",
