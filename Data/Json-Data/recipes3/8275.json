I did not use the bell pepper I added some dried minced onion I also added about 3/4 teaspoon of cumin I forgot the garlic powder but did not miss it. I mashed the beans with fork before mixing everything up. I cooked the burgers on a nonstick griddle with a little olive oil. The burgers were sticky to handle but were easy to flip once they cooked a while. I made 6 burgers with this recipe...make sure you flatten them when you put them on the pan as they will puff up a little when cooking. If you don't want them too big make more patties because the ground turkey hardly shrinks at all.",
