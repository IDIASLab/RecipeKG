I even used less than stellar ingredients (name brand peanut butter and a store bought oreo crust) so I imagine that if good peanut butter were used along with a decent homemade cookie crust it would be even better! It was more trouble to make than I thought it would be but that was because my blender is not very good and all the peanut butter was too heavy for it and I had to keep stopping to mix the filling by hand. I ended up putting in 400 grams of peanut butter and adding about a 1/3 cup confectioners sugar in addition to the honey. I also put a bit more salt and topped it with chocolate sprinkles. The texture is a little strange when it comes out of the blender but it freezes up nicely. edit. my husband had some of this and loved it! He said it was as though it were from a restaurant!",

I used a low-sodium peanut butter and I left out the salt because we are on a low-sodium diet. Otherwise I followed the directions. The filling was smooth and tasted wonderfully of peanut butter and honey. The pie was great with no topping at all. It did take a little longer than 4 hours to freeze solid--more like 6 but that might just be the difference in freezer temperatures. Thanks for such a great addition to my healthy desserts collection!",
