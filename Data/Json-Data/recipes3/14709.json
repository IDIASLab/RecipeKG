According to some sources, shrimp de jonghe was invented at the turn of the 20th century by the De Jonghe brothers, Belgian immigrants and owners of DeJonghe's Hotel and Restaurant in Chicago. This garlicky, herbed casserole is one of the earliest Windy City specialties. This dish can be served as an appetizer or main course.",

Luckily the dish wasn t ruined and ended up tasting great anyway. The only mods I made was I added a little more garlic and a little more butter than the recipe called for.
