But as other reviewers noted there is a lot left out in the instructions. I would recommend this recipe to experienced cooks who already know how to toast the seeds roast the garlic and peppers and have a clear sense of the flavour and texture they are aiming for. The only change I made was adding acorn squash which looked great today at the grocery store. And...I never figured out what the 2/3 cup cooked rice was for. Great inspiration gaps in the instructions. Thanks!",
