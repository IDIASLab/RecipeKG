It comes in a 1.25 oz can similar to grated parmesan cheese. That being said, I gave this recipe a whirl. If you use file powder, I'd recommend omitting the tomato paste, because the end result is super thick. Also, it adds way too much tomato flavor and therefore hides all the other flavors. Also, I skipped the flour step, because I felt it was unnecessary. The final result was just okay, all I could taste was tomato. Next time, I'll use more green pepper and onion, and no tomato paste. *12/13/07* So I decided to give this another shot, and still no luck. I did fine making the roux, but it's the darn tomato paste. I should have left it out, AGAIN, but I wanted to retry the recipe step by step. My end result, again was a thick, flavorless glop of tomato mess. You would never know there is onion or green pepper in this thing. Sorry for the poor review, but I guess this recipe isn't for me. Thanks anyway.",

Add powder to gumbo only after it is completely cooked and the stove heat has been reduced. Otherwise the gumbo will become stringy and completely unpalatable. i added a bit of vegetable stock with the tomato paste and a jalapeno to spice it up.. DELICIOUS!!",

The dark roux is key to this dish and it's where all of the flavor lies. Making the roux is a bit time consuming, but it's well worth the effort. Otherwise, you're just making an ordinary soup type stew. I personally don't use tomatoes in my gumbo. Give it another shot and I'm sure you'll see a huge difference in taste.",
