It was still VERY GOOD and satisfied a desire for something creamy and cheesy even though I made it without dairy except for grass-fed Kerrygold butter (the best kind of butter and is a healthy fat). Even my husband and friend -- who have no dietary restrictions -- liked it. We were impressed that the zoodles retained their al dente texture even with re-heating as leftovers. I only had 1.5 lb package of chicken breast and four organic zucchini and that ratio was waaaay too much protein. I bought 6 more zucchini the next day and that ratio was perfect. So 10 zucchini to 1.5 lbs chicken breast... means that I used almost double what the recipe called for. Oh wait it doesn't say 1 lb chicken breast. It says 1 chicken breast. Then I guess I used a similar ratio. That's confusing and in my opinion the recipe should include more exact measurements since chicken breasts come in all sizes. I always buy organic zucchini because zucchini are on the EWG's dirty dozen list for produce meaning they retain a large amount of pesticide residues so organic is best for health. I made my own pesto (EVOO garlic basil parsley walnuts and macadamia nuts S P) and used the whole batch. For the second batch of zoodles I added a bunch of salt and let them sit for 30 minutes to sweat out extra liquid. Then rinsed and dried them in a sal",
