Melt a little butter and add a little oil.  Throw in the diced potatoes, with the skin on, and as much sweet onion as you like.  I use vidalia or mayan.  Skip the green pepper.  Then just get happy with the spices.  We like celery seed, a touch of cumin, a dash of paprika, salt and pepper, garlic powder, whatever we happen to grab.  It always comes out deelish.  Definitely good for breakfast, lunch or anytime.  For dinner we might throw a little gravy and maybe some shredded cheese on them.  Always crispy if I leave the lid on.  I don't have the problem another reviewer has with them not crisping.  Maybe it's the nonstick electric skillet....don't really know.",

I followed another's advice and used regular baking potatoes, which I peeled, cubed and then cooked in the microwave for apprx 10 min (just to speed up the process so that they would better match the cooking time of the corndogs I was making).  Also, I added half of a chopped, red bell pepper. This tastes just like those O'brian potatoes you can purchase in stores and although those are a little more convenient, the taste of these are much better. I sprinkled a little cheese to melt over my serving while my boyfriend and daughter used their extra ketchup from their corn dogs with theirs. A good side to any meal: B/L/D! Thanks Verona!",

Then I peeled(I prefer no skins) and when cooled chopped into little cubes.  Next I chopped up 1/2 green pepper, 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 onion into little cubes and sauteed in my electric skillet with some olive oil for 3minutes then added a couple of dabs of butter and sauteed for another 2 minutes.  In went the potatoes with black pepper, salt, paprika, garlic powder and whatever spice you like and  mix it all up and I added a few more dabs of butter(love butter).  I let it cook for 10 minutes or more on each side on med/low setting.  Easier for me to break it up in sections with spatula in the skillet to flip it over- so each side is nice and brown.  A must try-YUMMY!!!!",
