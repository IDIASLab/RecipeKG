I also added Dijon mustard and real garlic instead of garlic powder. I also cut down on the amount of bread crumbs and made them out of whole wheat to make them a little healthier. I also omitted the soy sauce for the same reason. They came out great. The only thing I would do different next time is to give them just a little heat. Enjoy.",

I pretty much 2/3rds this, but  didn't change the ratios too much.  (2#mixed turkey, 1 1/2c onions, 1/2c breadcrumbs, 1T worcestershire, 1T dijon mustard, 3cl garlic, 1t poultry seasoning, 3/4t dry mustard)  I panfried these.  They even browned like beef burgers - meaning got crispy dark places.  Adding those cooked onions is a good trick - especially with turkey - & if you're using allwhite (which I don't recommend for burgers).  Turkey can be dry & flavorless, but this recipe is worth keeping.  Thanks!  One more thing:  These are some big burgers; 9 from 2#.  I suppose quarter pound is usual, but I'll make 'em smaller next time.  Very filling.",
