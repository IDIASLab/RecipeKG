The vegetables and fresh herbs listed in the recipe are usually what is in supermarket \"soup mix vegetables\" packages here in the U.S. northeast. To reduce the fat I do use skin-on bone-in split chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. There is still some fat under the skin necessary to hold the flavors. To keep the vegetables from becoming flavorless mush I cut them bite-sized but don't add them until 20 minutes before the soup is done and don't puree them. I add the herbs in the last few minutes. My experience is that the split breasts are done and tender after 40 minutes of simmering. So I start the breasts around 20 minutes before the vegetables in lightly salted boiling water w/ a couple of teaspoons of cider vinegar to draw some of the calcium and gelatin from the bones and skin into the broth which enriches it then sprinkle in the black pepper. Personally while I love all the other vegetables in this recipe especially the parsnip I find turnip tends to overwhelm the other flavors so I don't use it. The turnip that comes in the soup vegetable package is delicious mashed into mashed potatoes though.",

Never tried the noodles etc - just good old crusty bread and it was fantastic - in fact about to make it again only 23 weeks later.",

Anyway I cooked a whole chicken in water only (overnight when the night was short anyway). Then I pulled out the chicken to cool turning the slow cooker up onto high. After deboning the meat I returned the bones to the crockpot with some vinegar S&P to taste. By noon time I pulled out the bones and put in the veggies on high to cook throughout the afternoon. When the veggies were tender I didn't only process the veggies with my blender wand I actually misread and 'trusted' the misreading so I blended the chicken into the soup at the same time. The expressions on my family's faces were dubious and they expected to be reaching for the means to make PBJ's (doesn't happen often but when one of my experiments doesn't work out that's the agreed upon default....) anyway when we sat down to eat the soup with salad and nice bread rolls they were astounded with how yummy and filling and how down-right comfort-food this turned out to be. Sorry for misunderstanding... well sort of and thanks for sharing Angchick because this 'new' type of chicken soup really is comfort food and I'm so excited that it's getting to be fall again so I can make this again. just picked up turnips and parsnips at the store this week and had to share!
