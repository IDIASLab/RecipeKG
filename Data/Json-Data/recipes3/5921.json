The secret to good eggplant is to peel and drain it, so it's not soggy.  Serve with crusty italian bread, and a tossed salad, and you have a hearty meal.  It seems like a lot of work but it's not.

The only chane I made was to use canned whole tomatoes rather than a prepared sauce and I dressed the tomatoes up in an Italian seasoning and added a tablespoon of oil. This had just the right amount of cheese and sauce. Almost forgot: I had to cook it longer than 45 in order to get the cheese golden and the eggplant soft. Depending on your oven I guess--it's more like 1 hour and 5 minutes.",

This reminds me of lasagna and I like that this dish includes pasta so it is more filling. I made a few changes. Before doing anything I preheated the oven to 350 to \"pre-cook\" the eggplant. I beat two eggs in one bowl and had another bowl of Italian bread crumbs. I dipped the eggplant slices in the egg and then in the crumbs and then put the slices on a baking sheet. I cooked the eggplant in the oven for about 10 minutes on each side so that it was a little crispy and would hold up better. Then when layering it all together I added a layer of cooked fresh spinach on top of the sauce but underneath the eggplant. I left out the egg in the cheese layer because I had already dipped the eggplant in egg and I just figured that was enough. I didn't miss the egg from the cheese layer it was plenty rich. I used two jars of sauce for this because I like a good amount of sauce and other reviewers said it was dry with the recommended amount. And I added some sauteed onion and garlic to the tomato sauce. Mine really came out amazing and I can't wait to make it again!",

I added some mushrooms onions tomatoes & zucchini to the bottom layer. I used whole wheat pasta & left it out of the layers because I had accidentally over cooked them over the stove & didn't want them to get anymore soggy in the oven. I just served the Eggplant Parmesan on top of the noodles like you would spaghetti. The cheesy layer on top of the eggplant & other veggies was delish! Will definitely make this again.",
