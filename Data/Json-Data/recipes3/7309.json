They get coated much more evenly this way.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

In my opinion, the chili powder alone, let alone the sheer volume of it and combining it with the Montreal Steak Seasoning, would be incompatible and, frankly, inedible.  I mean, it just doesn\u2019t belong.  However....omit the chili powder altogether, toss the vegetables (I added some grape tomatoes) with olive oil and the Montreal Steak Seasoning TO TASTE, add a little chicken broth so this doesn't turn out dried up, crispy and foul, and we've got something here.  Delicious.",
