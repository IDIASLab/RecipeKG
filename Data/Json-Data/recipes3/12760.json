I did just eyeball the rosemary b/c I didn't want to use the whole tsp., as I thought it would be too much for me. No Italian bread in the house, so I used a butter bread that I had on hand. Really, really great....a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I agree with a previous reviewer about the rosemary -- too much for our liking, so I scaled it down a bit. I also used white cheddar in place of American. Easy recipe to tweak according to your own tastes. Love the onions and the idea to add mushrooms. You could also add bits of chopped pepperoni, crumbles of Italian sausage,  or other \"pizza\" toppings. Let the sandwiches cool for a couple minutes so the cheese doesn't run out everywhere.  I quartered them. Serve with marinara sauce.  A big hit! Thanks for submitting the recipe. Great idea!",

I made these classic sandwiches for a group of women at my house yesterday and then another group at a friend's house today because I had leftover ingredients. I prettymuch followed the recipe the first time except used chopped dried onions (some friends will eat these but don't like fresh onion.) Today I used my Italian seasoning and sprinkled it on the butter I spread on the bread slices; then sprinkled the onion and garlic on the grilling bread slices before putting together to flip over. And I think I'll look for sliced mozzarella next time AND remember to put out the marinara which I forgot both times!",
