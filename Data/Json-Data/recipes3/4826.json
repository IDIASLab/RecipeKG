I used 1 ripe plantain - steamed it rather than boiled it, used 1/4 c. natural peanut butter, and added 1/8 c. honey, 1/4 t. salt, and about a tablespoon of the \"steaming\" liquid. Made about 12. It bakes up very nicely and makes a great \"energy\" snack.  The first time I made it I didn't use honey and I thought it was a little bland - adding the honey the second time made a big difference!  Thanks for the idea!!! Just wanted to add that I baked the balls for 25-30 minutes because I made mine smaller than the recipe suggested.",

I thought adding the peanutbutter would help my husband enjoy them more and he still won't touch them.  Make sure you mash the plantains really well so the balls stick together.  I didn't have any honey and he suggested(after they were in the oven) to use pancake syrup to sweeten them up a bit.  I did sprinkle them with cinnamon before baking.  If you like plantains but don't want to fry them then give this one a try.",

I planned on using green plantains but by the time I got around to making these my plantains were ripe so I just decided to go with it anyway. I added some pumpkin pie spice and some honey but I'm not sure I needed to. You don't really taste the peanut butter but the plantains have sort of a tart taste that is really nice. These don't look that appetizing (you'll see from my picture!) but they are a nice little snack. I think that 45 min was a bit too long for mine--some are a bit dark on the bottom.
