I didn't think this would be anything more than just regular string beans, but it really was a lot more than that, it was superb! :)  The mushrooms are really important in order to get the full taste of this so don't forget them.  I used baby portobello.  The carrots add to the taste and make the dish look very appetizing because of the color contrast.  I steamed the carrots and beans instead of boiling.  If you prefer to do it this way as well, then I would suggest to make sure either a) the carrots are a cut little ticker than the beans before steaming all at once, or b) cutting the carrots the same thickness as the beans, but start steaming the beans for 3 minutes first before adding the carrots as the two vegetables won't steam at the same rate.  It's good to have the same texture for both rather than one softer than the other.  Also, as per another review I added 1 tsp of rosemary and 1 tsp thyme to the mix and everything came out great.  Even a little more of the sesame seeds doesn't hurt.  I had no issues with the salt content.  Will definitely make this again!",

I say, without this recipe, I'd never have found the BEST green bean recipe of my life. Hands down the only recipe I have where everyone will eat the hated green beans. I'd happily have absconded with the pan and had nothing else, & I'm not vegetarian. Changes I made, based on my desires & some pointers posted here: split the butter in half and added 2 tbsp canola oil. (Just don't like olive!) Omitted the salt, up the seasoned salt to 3/4 tsp, garlic powder instead of salt AND added 2 tsp minced garlic. At the end, sprinkled the surface with salt, and sprinkled 1/4 C Parmesan on top. I followed procedure, even when I didn't want to. Steamed my beans and carrots, which I had julienned. For anyone doing this, follow another reviewer's advice; steam the green beans alone for a few minutes before adding the carrots. I didn't. No major consequences, but the veggies would've been more uniform. However, as the mushrooms and onions ended up being a similar texture to the thinly julienned carrots, it didn't really matter! I give this a HUGE 5 STARS. The best veggie recipe I possess. I love all 4 vegetables in the medley. I can't express my thanks enough. As one reviewer mentioned, make this when the dish will accompany something that can be made ahead, or in an oven or slow cooker. This will come out perfectly if you give it your attention, and knife skills. BEAUTIFUL! So delicious. Thank you.",
