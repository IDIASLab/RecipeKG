I don\u2019t know what sweet chili sauce is, there was nothing by that name in the Asian section of my grocery store, so I used chili sauce which is similar to ketchup and found near the ketchup. I\u2019m new to the air fryer and wondered if I\u2019d have to turn the shrimp halfway through cooking, but it\u2019s not necessary, and I found the time suggested was perfect. I will definitely make these again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!",

I had to cook a number of batches, and put them into a low oven, 200  degrees, to stay warm. Some got overcooked  and tough. The sauce was good, but I had to make more, and did have to dilute it with water. It did not stick very well to the floured shrimp. It took more pano than the recipe said; luckily I had plenty.

I used more panko because it stuck well and I was running out.. I used raw 16-20 jumbo shrimp that I have never had a failure with in the past. I cooked for 12 minutes. The shrimp looked good as far as browning goes. But they were dry, dry, dry, and heading towards disasterously overcooked, even at 390. The breading was crispy, but dry too on the surface, and a little doughy underneath. Finally, I thought whatever flavor the shrimp had left was stolen by the bam bam sauce. It was an injustice to some nice shrimp. Full disclaimer: this was only my third time with the air fryer. Maybe I'm not so keen on air frying. We shall see.",

After 32 shrimp were dipped in the sauce, it was gone.  So I would suggest just getting 3/4 lb. shrimp next time I made this.  The other issue is all of the sauce was gone at this point and there was nothing left to use when we ate the cooked product.  Luckily I had made Bang Bang Tofu the night before and had leftover sauce from that which we used.  It was super delicious!  It even heated up nicely in the toaster oven the next night for leftovers.  I was only able to get 12 shrimp into my air fryer at a time so it took a number of batches to get all of my shrimp cooked.  My mother-in-law thought it tasted just like Bonefish Grill's recipe!",
