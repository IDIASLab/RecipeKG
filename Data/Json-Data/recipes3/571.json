HOWEVER, with that said, my recipe has been a little bit \u201ctweaked\u201d if you will.  First off, omit the sesame seeds and dried parsley.  Instead of 1-8 oz pkg of cream cheese, put in half a container (small tub) of cream cheese w/ chives and chop \u00bc of an onion finely.  Season the chicken (you only need 2 breasts, not 6) with salt, pepper and garlic powder and cook it with the onions in a little of extra virgin olive oil.  When it\u2019s done (and cooled slightly), chop chicken into little pieces, or shred and add the chicken and onion mixture to the cream cheese and mix well.  Then proceed with regular directions as far as stuffing and baking.  One thing though, if you want bite sized appetizers, simply put a small amount in each triangle vs. combing two to make a square.  Trust me, you and your guests will love it!",

I softened the cream cheese in the microwave to make it really creamy and easy to mix. I thought about adding some fresh chopped broccoli for crunch next time but my husband said not to- he liked them just the way they were. Overall this recipe was quick easy and very rich-- it's not one for someone who doesn't like cream cheese! HINT: leftovers heated in the microwave get a little soggy so next time I'll reheat leftovers (if there are any!) in the oven.",
