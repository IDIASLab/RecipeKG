Grilled the pork on the barbeque using indirect heat until the desired temperature and then glazed it with the pepper jelly until it coated the meat.  As another reviewer noted, this can be quite spicy, so cut back on the seasonings if you need to.  Served with mashed cauliflower and candied carrots for a quick easy weeknight meal.  Thank you Walshmartin for a nice change of pace.",

We have never used a tenderloin, instead we use loin chops with and without a bone.  We also grilled it outside. We set the grill to high heat and waited to get up to temp. We seared the meat for about 5 minutes on each side and then lowered the temp to med and cooked it until it reached almost 145. We put 1/3 of the jelly on at the beginning , 1/3 after searing both sides and 1/3 later. It does cook quickly. Keep an eye on the temp. Very important.",
