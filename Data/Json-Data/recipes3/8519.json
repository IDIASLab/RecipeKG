                "reviewBody": "3.12.17 One comment would be to get your sausage/sauce going before you cook your pasta because IMO ideally you want to mix in the pasta right after you drain it. The sausage/sauce mixture takes a while so if the pasta sits out too long after being drained (like mine did today) it tends to dry out and flatten the tubular pasta. Not a big deal but that s what I lll do next time. After I mixed everything together it seemed VERY dry so I did add in some tomato juice for fear of this drying out too much in the oven. Used hot sausage loved the kalamata olives (probably will add even more next time and maybe some red pepper flakes) and I may even add a small can of tomato sauce. This recipe makes a lot and in this house it s probably 7-8 servings (but we're not big eaters) when served with salad and hot bread. Thoroughly enjoyed and looking forward to some yummy leftovers.",
