I halved the recipe thereby requiring 1/4c sour cream and 3/4c Mayo - a total of 1 c. is a lot for 2 potatoes - the result was more like potato soup. I had to drain/scrape off as much as I could to make this palatable. It also benefits from a pinch of sugar a pinch of salt and a good shake of pepper. Overall I will likely stick with my old recipe but it was nice to try something new.",
