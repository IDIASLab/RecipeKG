I did some of them with the powdered sugar some with white chocolate some with milk chocolate and some are double-dipped... heh-heh-heh.:) I used coconut rum which is excellent and doubled it (1/2c.) because they were otherwise looking too dry. Lastly I used a mixture of nuts - almonds pecans & walnuts. I think this recipe just made the cut for an annual holiday fave!",

Seriously: how did these work out for so many other cooks? Other coconut rum ball recipes include an entire box of confectioners sugar. That would have fixed the consistency but really: they were YUMMY and less sweet w/double the wafers instead. My suggestion: make them with extra wafers and sugar on hand and far enough ahead of schedule to tinker with this recipe. With all good ingredients and no baking these will end up fine if you can achieve the proper consistency. But this recipe as written did not work for me.",
