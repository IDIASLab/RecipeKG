Also, I drained and rinsed the beans, I always do this because it helps reduce some of the sodium in canned beans and it gets rid of that yucky starchy gooey liquid. Even without the bean liquid, I still only used 3 cups of stock and that was plenty. I did mash one can of beans with a fork instead of pureeing it, and I only added about 1/2 cup of cheese to the soup. I didn't think it was necessary to put 2 cups of cheese in it and add all that fat; I left the rest of the cheese out for us to add a little to each of our bowls. My husband ate three bowls of this the first night, so it is definitely a keeper, and I didn't think I would like white chili. what a great surprise!",

I substituted diced chicken pieces for the ground turkey; added more beans; & since i didn't have green chilies, substituted Pepper Jack cheese for the Monterey jack & added a little  Chipotle Chili Pepper for some zing. It's the combination of seasonings that make this dish so awesome. If you're tempted to leave out the cinnamon...DON'T! Threw some corn starch in to thicken, simmered for about 30 min.& served with rice,sour cream, extra cheese & corn chips. Thanks Donna",
