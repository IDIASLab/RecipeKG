Having said that, this was very good! Rather than the full 1/2 cup of rum, I used 1/4 cup of the juice drained from the pineapple and 1/4 cup Malibu (coconut flavored)rum. The brand of cream of coconut I use (Coco Lopez) comes in a 16 oz. can, which is 2 ozs. more than this recipe calls for. Nevertheless, I still used all of the remaining cream of coconut mixed with 2 T. Malibu rum and gradually brushed it all over the top and sides of the cake with a pastry brush. While it was still somewhat sticky I sprinkled toasted coconut liberally on the top, which proved to be a perfect addition both in flavor and appearance. This is a very moist and delicately flavored cake, which I think may have been overpowered by the rum had I used the full 1/2 cup. But it still had that unmistakable cake mix taste.  I think from now on I will substitute either a French Vanilla or even white cake mix for any recipe calling for a yellow cake mix. The flavor is better and these don't have that awful yellow color. *Update* -- Sent this to work with hubby, who called to report that his staff went nuts over this cake!",

I used egg beaters instead of eggs. I used applesauce instead of the oil. I used light coconut milk instead of whole fat coconut milk. I topped with fat free cool whip.

Poked holes with a chop stick in the hot cake and poured the milk mixture all over the top. When the cake cooled I topped it off with fresh whipped cream (you can use cool whip). Yummy!",

I didn't have cream of coconut so I omitted it in the batter and used a small can of sweetened condensed milk in place of it for the glaze. I used a 19 oz can of crushed pineapple and put the juice in with the cake mix etc. before blending then stired in the rest of the pineapple afterwards. I used coconut flavored rum in the cake and in the glaze I used pineapple flavored rum. I toasted 1 cup of coconut in the oven for 5 min and then put it in the bottom of the bundt pan before pouring the batter on top. That was our favorite part of the cake and I would definitely recommend trying it. I baked for 1 hour at 325 degrees. It really does taste like a pina colada!",
