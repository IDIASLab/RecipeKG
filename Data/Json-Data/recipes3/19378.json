Beat the icing sugar in gradually.I used the full amount. 3. I added about 2 oz more of white chocolate. I also toasted the pecans and stirred in some dried cranberries. This year it started to set before I got it into the fridge! Thanks for a great recipe!",

It set up extrememly soft, too.  Perhaps add more white chocolate to give it a more fudgy texture.  I found, however, that substituting white chocolate for the milk and dark in Aunt Teen's recipe on this site made a much better white fudge.  It came out to be the right flavor and texture, while this was a bit like solid icing.",

I halfed the confectioners suguar to 2 cups because I felt 4 cups was too much, and would make it way to sweet. Freezing for a few hours, and using wax/parchment paper (in the pan to set in) also helps a lot. I also experienced stickyness when I'd cut the fudge (I think it may be due the the fact that I halved the confectioners sugar), but I'm rating this recipe based on the taste, and it is definately 5 stars. I think next time, I'll add 1 or 2 more ounces to make up for the 2 cups of confectioners sugar. I think that may make it less sticky and easier to cut. Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe. Although we don't celebrate christmas, it gives me more opportunity to make it several times during the year. :) Definately 5 stars. Awesome taste!",
