Anyway I used Hillshire Farm Smoked Sausage(cut into slices). I also added some cooked onion to the sausage and oil. To the pudding mixture I added some garlic powder along with the salt/pepper. Was crusty and delicious when done I served this with a simple mustard(my family not keen on the onion gravy). Was very simple and a casual meal keeper. Thanks so much!!!!",
