It does make a lot of sauce and I believe I could have made a little more pasta.  It was super creamy and had a soft tomato taste.  I served this as a side dish to 'Southern BBQ Chicken' from AR.  Luckily, I didn't create any flames as the submitter said may happen when adding the vodka to the hot pan.  I had a lot of leftovers, so I froze containers to share with our son and DIL, my in-laws and have a small container for DH's lunch tomorrow.  I love trying new recipes and this did not disappoint.  \nThe next time, I'm going to try adding some red pepper flakes to add a little heat to the dish.",

I poured from a measuring cup not the bottle as suggested in other places. I added some chicken pieces which I had saut\u00e9ed in butter and garlic. Next time I might add some chili flakes to add some heat which we enjoy. Also I might increase the amount of cheese to make the sauce even creamier. I have frozen several portions (the recipe makes a lot!) which I will use over the coming weeks. I cooked up some penne and we had a simple salad with it. Thanks for this recipe.",
