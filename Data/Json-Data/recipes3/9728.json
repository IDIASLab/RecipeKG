For a college student who doesn't like to eat out much, like me, those two things are definitely what I'm looking for. Enjoy! If you're looking for a way to add more vegetables, throw in some diced carrots and chopped celery; add when you toss the turnips in.",

I added the herbs salt and pepper. 1/2 cup lite sour cream and 1/4 cup of low fat yogurt substitued for the heavy cream. I added this mixture to the turnips after the 10-15 minutes cooking time and broth had been reduced. I also added Parmesan at this time too and shut off the heat. We made 5 servings out of it.",
