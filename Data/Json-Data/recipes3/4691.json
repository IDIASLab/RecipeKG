                "reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIPS: After making this for several years, I realized that i never made a review & many things weren't mentioned enough so it's confusing to know what to follow.  1. Just tastes better to have the traditional balls instead of slicing!!! 350 for 30 min or until outside is nice brown color (i just use 1lb).  To make it easier, you can still follow directions and make log (width/height of desired meatballs), but cut PRIOR to putting in oven.  If I do make these into sammies b/c I only have hamburger buns, I make log into RECTANGLE with desired thickness and bake for 30 min at 350 (so tender)!  2nd, DO NOT add a T of pepper. A tsp is fine, and there is no need for salt. 3rd, add a tsp of italian seasoning or make your own combination (oregano, basil, garlic powder).  4th, my husband is not a fan of onions but doesn't mind if I stick green onions in.  Last, if you like more of a meatball texture ...add an egg. I don't.  I DO like that I can make ahead and then when ready, re-heat meatballs in marina sauce which I have in a saucepan.  Then just stick in oven when the men in your family want a quick meal (i have all boys)! For the marina sauce, I use what I have on hand (chunky spaghetti sauce)!",

Popped the meat inside with mozzerella cheese, put on a baking sheet baked until cheese was melted and tops were browned.  The guys loved them, all through football season!!!!!!!!!

I add one egg, and a full cup of mozzarella cheese to the loaf with extra cheese on top. I also leave out the onion. We always serve this on lightly toasted buns with sauteed onions and peppers.
