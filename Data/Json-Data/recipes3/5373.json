I didn't want to wait for potatoes to boil!  It turned out great and definitely became the overall favorite. I enjoy a simple garlic mayonnaise to accompany the cakes but you can pretty much use whatever you desire.",

Following another reviewer's suggestion, I used 2 cans of salmon so it was super easy to prepare and I did not have to get anything special from the grocery store.  This is a terrific mid-week meal.  I do not have italian seasoning so I used oregano, basil, salt and pepper.  I also made a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce by adding cayenne, salt, pepper and some juice from the capers to some mayo.",

What really grabbed my guests...I served this dish with Mango Salsa!!! Wow!",

They used ketchup to dip, my husband and I liked the suggested dip of Mayo, cayenne, salt, pepper, and juice from jar of capers.  Thanks for sharing this one. I just had some leftover grilled salmon I wanted to use for something different.",

This was a pretty easy recipe to make as well. It would have been excellent with cooked flaked salmon as mentioned in the recipe but I only had canned which worked out fine. When you cook these don t be afraid to get a really good golden brown on each side. This way it will have a crispy shell with a tender interior. What really brings this together is the topping. I chose mayonnaise and sriracha which was a heavenly combination for this dish.",
