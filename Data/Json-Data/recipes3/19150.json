I don't have a kitchen funnel so I used a ziploc bag with a corner cut off. These were awesome really simple to make quick to fry...delicious...what else? They are just great. I used two spatulas to flip them over. Whatever you use to flip them make sure you grab them in the middle because the corners will be crispier and break off easily.",

When I poured the batter in the hot oil it expanded and oil poured over the top of the deep fryer. I unplugged the fryer and the funnel cake continued to cook....looked right in the end but we couldn't eat it - it tasted like it was saturated with oil (probably because the temp dropped). Anyone have any ideas on what I may have done wrong?",

Add 1 tsp of vanilla   3. MAKE SURE YOU USE ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR. I used self-rising once and got the same results as a previous reviewer...the cake sinks to the bottom, separates, and fries up as little, hard-to-serve balls/crumbs. It's a mess.  4. If batter is made the night before, and kept in the fridge, the flavors meld together and the funnel cake is even more tasty. Be sure to get it out an hour or so before cooking so it's not too thick...and give it a good stir.  5. I use this batter for deep-fried Twinkies, too. Just dip in your Twinky, place in the oil, and remove when golden.",
