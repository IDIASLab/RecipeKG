I boiled 8 large eggs, grated 1/4 of a med onion, (because I do like the flavor of onion), added 1/4 teas. onion salt instead of salt, added 1 teas. lemon juice and cut the mayo to 1/2 cup.  Outstanding egg salad.  I hardly ever made egg salad but will make it more often now.  Can't wait to share this with friends.",

But when this gem of a recipe landed on my RSS feed I just knew I had to try it. I now have a new favorite way to make egg salad sandwiches. The mustard powder gives it that mustardy flavor without the extra vinegar that's present in prepared mustard. And the dill weed! Oh my - THAT is what sets this whole recipe apart. With a more intense dill flavor than regular dill relish it perfectly compliments the eggs and mayo. And since we love onions I finely chopped about 2 Tblsp. of fresh onion into my salad instead of the plain onion flakes (which can sometimes be more pungent than the \"real\" thing). Try this recipe - you won't be disappointed! Thanks Sara!",
