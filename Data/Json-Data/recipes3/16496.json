UPDATE: used up rest of filling this time made casserole-type dish. put half biscuits on bottom of greased glass dish (had to smush them around some to get it covered) topped with spinach mixture (with extra sauteed onions added) plopped rest of biscuits on top. cooked same amount of time. EVEN BETTER because 1. super easy and 2. MORE spinach-y. have already been requested again and again...",

I made it all for myself and it was my lunch for an entire week (plus dinner once or twice - depending on serving size of course but a little bit will do ya!) I will definitely try this again. I might add mushrooms to it or potatoes - it was really that versatile. Didn't use phyllo dough per se but I used \"baking pastry dough\" - it's basically the same thing. Can't recommend enough!",

I used almost double the spinach with the same amount of cheese and that worked out great for me. As one reviewer suggested I tried using the crescent rolls instead of phyllo. It didn't work out at all to do the jelly roll; the dough just didn't stick together and the filling spilled out. With the second half of the filling I put it in the bottom of a 9\" pie pan and then covered the top with the crescent rolls. Loved the flavor and the ease. THANKS for a great recipe!",
