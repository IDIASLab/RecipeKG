DO NOT PEAK HALF WAY THRU AS THE PUDS COULD COLLAPSE. 3/4 THRU COOKING LOWER THE TEMPERATURE TO LET HEKP STOP THE BASE BEING SOGGY.

                "reviewBody": "Yum these are good! I love Yorkshire pudding but this was my first time trying to make it. Turned out very nice. Instead of a 6-muffin tin I used a 12-muffin tin (smaller muffins than the 6-pan) and had batter to fill 8 of the cups to 3/4. Also I used bacon grease and butter instead of beef drippings (just enough to cover the bottom of the tins). I noticed the bacon grease was smoking a bit so I moved the tray to the middle rack - no problems after that. Followed the other directions exactly with no substitutions. The Yorkies rose to 2x their height and were perfectly golden and yummy. Will definitely make again! Some tips: 1) the tray needs to be very very hot! Keep it in the oven for 5-7 min as recommended. 2) make the batter and let it sit for a bit while the oven preheats. 3) fill the tins as quickly as possible and pop back in the oven.",

First make sure to mix your batter about half hour before baking so it isn't cold. Second mix very well until it is smooth and add milk (I used half and half) just until it's a smooth consistency. I didn't need all of the milk. Third preheat your muffin tin until it's HOT. Add just enough drippings to cover the bottom. I have a very hot oven so I baked the yorkies for 10 minutes at 450 then 10 minutes at 350. They rose SKY HIGH and the texture was perfect. Very light and tasty complimented my prime rib very well.",

Then quickly poured in batter. Took out 5 mins early because it was really browning but I should have cooked a little longer there were a few that were a little wet. Overall excellent and tasty. Will use this recipe everytime we have roast beef. UPDATE: first time I have used the drippings from the roast and I tried using the convection setting for the oven and the yorkshires were the highest and the best ever!!! Was it the drippings or the convection method that made then rise higher?? Also cooked way faster this way. 18mins or so. Update:cooked them on lowest rack setting down with 8 mins left and nice and crispy!! Thanks Michele Cambridge Ontario",
