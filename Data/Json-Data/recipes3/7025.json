For some reason I really wanted jalepenos in this dish so I added 1/2 of a seeded jalepeno diced. I served this over white jasmine rice with sliced avocado. The avocado was so delicious..the cool rich taste blended so smoothly with the acidic tomatoes and slightly bitter swiss chard. I'd like to try this with mixed beans and fresh mozzarella cheese too. Definitely try this one..It's an unusual but very yummy recipe!",

The spices on the chicken really complemented the earthy flavors in the chard dish...and I added a bit of coriander to the chard also - it was yuuummy:).
