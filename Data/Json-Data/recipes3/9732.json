Only things I did differently were to add an additional 1/2 jalapeno and quite a bit more cilantro as I thought it needed a bit more kick (and I'm not a fan of too much kick!). I added about 2 T of tahini and added more olive oil for a creamier consistency. I prefer using a food processor for hummus. A keeper thanks!",

I normally would have used bean juice but I forgot to save it. I added some cumin just cause we love it and this is very good; I imagine it will be even better after resting in the fridge for a while. I'll make this often.",
