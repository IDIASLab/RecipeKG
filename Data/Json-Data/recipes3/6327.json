The vegetable has such a delicate peppery taste that's delightful by itself - I normally don't even add salt (only pepper) because the salt will mask its natural taste. I decided to give this recipe the benefit of the doubt and used 1/4 of the recommended amount of balsamic vinegar - it completely covered the natural taste of the leaves (couldn't penetrate some of the stalks, thank goodness) and all I could taste was vinegar. My advice? Keep it simple. Saute in garlic and olive oil and add some pepper at the end - that's it.",

I diced the ribs of rainbow chard and sauted them with diced onion...this gave the dish a bit of crunch.  I also had a jar of roasted red peppers and slivered them in when the chard was added.  The combo was excellent. I loved the amount of vinegar (our family loves vinegar). I did add a pinch of sugar to offset the acidity.  Topped smashed fingerling potatoes with this colorful and yummy wilted chard. And served with a sliced heirloom tomato! YUM!  My husband and my 17 month old son LOVED it.",
