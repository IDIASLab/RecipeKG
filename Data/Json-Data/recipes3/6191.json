It ended up like baby food. I may just hit the pulse button until it looks well mixed. Also I agree with not adding as much flour. To me (and my husband noticed once I said it) it tasted a little bit floury. Lastly I may just add more spices to give it a bit more flavor. My husband said the flavor was good but I think it needs a bit more. I\"ll try it again though!",

I make quiche about twice a month so this is not a new menu item for us but adding zucchini to and making it without a crust was! I only gave it 4 stars ONLY because I altered the recipe based on other reviews. I reduced the flour to just over 1/2 cup (I rarely measure) and added the a variety of cheeses to include the feta and parmesan as well as Mozerella as well as some white cheddar. I did add a full small onion that I chopped (not grated) and I used 2 yellow squash and 1 zucchini as that is what I had on hand. I also added italian seasoning black pepper a small amount of salt and a LOT of dried parsley...Again...i dont measure. I just eyeballed it all based on the reviews and the recipe as well and our our tastes. I did add 4 eggs and a small amount of milk. Typically when I make quiche I use mayo in it (thus i dont use but 3-4 eggs since it has eggs) but I decided to just up the cheese just for this recipe...it was already filling my pan up quick! It looks great now and smells great! Cant wait to eat! Bread finishing in oven and salad ready! Yum Yum! Hubby wanted a bit less bread (therefore no crust was GREAT!) Thanks for recipe!!!!:)",
