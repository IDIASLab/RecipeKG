Even though I didn't absolutely love it I liked the taste and the ease of this recipe. I could only find Chipolte Chili Powder and not Chipolte Seasoning which I am sure has more to it than just Chipolte peppers. I made the sauce using one teaspoon of the chipolte chili powder and tasted it before adding the regular chili powder. I felt the there was enough heat and smokiness from the chipolte that I did not add the additional chili powder. If you like more kick in your sauce add the regular chili powder. I used St. Louis style ribs and cooked for 8 hours (my pot runs hot). Good summertime recipe that doesn't heat up the house. I would make again because of the simplicity of this recipe.",

Coated the ribs well and cooked on low for 4 1/2 hours. Removed from the sauce and placed on a tin foil lined baking sheet pan and into a 375 degree oven, after mopping with remaining 1/2 bottle of Bar-B-Que sauce, for aprox., 30 minutes.  Came out tasting wonderful, flavorful and tender. Sure beats firing up the grill!",
