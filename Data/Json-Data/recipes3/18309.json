The patties are pretty wet and I was afraid of them falling to pieces once they hit the grill so I stuck them in the freezer for 30 minutes to firm them up. Not sure if this was necessary or not but they turned out perfect so I will do that again when I make them next time. I was amazed at how much these looked like hamburgers on the grill and they even had grill marks. We are not vegetarians and still enjoyed these very much. 5 star recipe all the way!",
