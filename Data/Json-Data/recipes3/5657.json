My husband is a traditional rabbit cooker (you know, hunter style or cream style), which is fine, but I was ready to get out of the box.  My kids and I loved this recipe!  I did tone down the sweetness by correcting it with more chicken stock and boiling it back down (for my husband).  I also cooked everything in a big dutch oven and just pulled out the rabbit to saute the veggies and drain the oil.  I did remove the bones from the rabbit while the veggies cooked; that allowed me to eat my dinner rather than cut up my children's!  AND no child felt badly about cutting up Bugs Bunny :). I think it helped!  5 stars from me and the kids and 4 from the traditional American hunter (whatever!  I'll be making this again!)  YUM!  Oh...I couldn't help but add a touch of saffron.  Just couldn't help myself!  It was beautiful and delicious! I would have taken a picture, but I was too excited to eat!  Even the next day, I had to say to a friend who was over, \"Here, you have to try this!!\"  I know I'm blabbing, but it really rocked!",

First of all, I browned the meat and then put that and all the rest of the ingredients (except I put a small, fresh cayenne pepper instead of the chili pepper) into my pressure cooker and cooked for 30 mins like one of the other people tried. (I just love the taste and tenderness that the pressure cooker gives!)  \nAfter the 30 mins. I took out the meat and deboned it...it was falling off the bone and VERY tender and tasty! I thickened the liquids with cornstarch and water and put the meat back in. The stew had too much heat (spice from the cayenne pepper) so I added about 1/4 c. of extra coconut milk. That helped alot! Next time I will add carrots, celery, and that extra milk. That should be just about perfect! :) Hubby loved it! We look forward to using this one again...thanks!",
