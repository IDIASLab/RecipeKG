I used baby eggplants for the flavor and tenderness used a whole pepper (orange because that's what I had on hand) added 2 cloves of minced garlic used Italian seasoning instead of the separate spices substituted 14 oz of crushed tomatoes for half the diced tomatoes used precooked bacon that I sauteed for a couple of minutes to crisp up nicely added a pinch of crushed red pepper and used aged provolone in place of the swiss cheese which I feel is a bit too mild for the bold flavors of the dish. I baked until the dish was bubbly and the cheese was nicely browned. It was delicous and we'll definitely make again with the same revisions I made the first time. We loved it.",
