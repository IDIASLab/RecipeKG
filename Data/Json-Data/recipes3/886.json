No tomato sauce so I used 15 oz of petite diced tomatoes with a clove of fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder. I tossed the butter in the colander with the pasta and put the pasta right into the skillet with the meat sauce then topped with the mozzarella. Came out great!! I used the called for amount of salt and thought it needed more after cooking- you have to use tomatoe sauce; not a spaghetti sauce. If you use a spaghetti sauce forget the salt. Good yummy recipe.",

I doubled the tomato sauce and cheese and added a little sweet bell pepper garlic and onion to the saut\u00e9ed ground beef before adding the tomato sauce. I also just eyeballed the parmesan cheese as I grated it so I think it was more than 1/4 up. I also baked it for 15 to 20 mins at 350 like others suggested. Will definitely make again!",
