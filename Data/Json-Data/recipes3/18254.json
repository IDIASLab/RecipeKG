Did add a little veg for  nutrition and to make it a meal. I added a few mushrooms to the onion mix in the beginning because they needed to be used.  I shredded zucchini and squash, sweated them in a colander while I made the risotto.  I chopped the shrimp for dietary needs as well as the asparagus. I added a lot more minced garlic too...we love it... Had to throw in red pepper to the risotto, more towards the last addition of broth! I added a little seasoning (Lantana all purpose)  to the broth wile it heated for extra kick (for the rice and the shrimp boil).... after boiling the shrimps and asparagus in the remaining broth I drained them in the colander with the rinsed shredded  squashes.....then just added everything to the rice. Didn't have all the parm (my bad) so subbed the last of the feta. Didn't change too much....just a fan of using what we have and not wasting food :)",

However the ratio of rice to liquid needs to be about 1:3 or 1:3 1/2 (I heat up enough for 1:4 to be safe) which would mean 9-12 cups of liquid rather than 4 and a HUGE amount of risotto.
