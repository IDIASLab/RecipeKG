TEETH CANNOT PENETRATE 1/8 inch slices of quickly cooked Canada goose. IMHO unless the goose can be sliced VAPOR thin no fast cook method will work it's got to be slow/pressure cooked prepped. OK DAY 2.... First: Salt&Pepper seasoned and PRESSURE COOKED thin sliced(perpendicular to the grain/muscle) goose in 2 cups of water for 30 min medium rocking. Removed from heat allowed to cool on it's own then used the original recipe... Others in my family would never dream of eating \"gross\" game food... I never offered to share!... it's way too good to share tender not pulverized. You can tell it's game not farmed... but it's only a sense a feeling not overwhelming. PrePressureCooked... it's a 5 in a different league altogether.",

I didn't change in the recipe other than adding some bell peppers I needed to use and it came out great.  It works well with geese you get earlier in the day as the chili sauce kind of neutralizes the gamey taste.  The only thing I would suggest is to slice the goose as thinly as possible.  But that's just my preference.",
