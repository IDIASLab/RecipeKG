                "reviewBody": "This recipe can be great, with a few modifications. After I pounded the chicken breasts I breaded them is self rising flour heavily seasoned. I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I browned the chicken breasts in olive oil and butter, to give them a really nice golden brown coating. Then I removed the chicken breasts, and deglazed the pan with the champagne. I used more champagne than was called for, (more sauce) and added some minced garlic and dried onions when I added the chicken back to the pan. I then added the mushrooms (the more the better), and simmered them for 20 mins. When I added the cream I did not measure, I just added as much as it took to thicken the sauce. I imagine it was about 2 cups like the recipe suggested. I served this with mashed potatoes and broccoli, however I think it would be great with rice cooked in chicken broth. A very yummy recipe, but more champagne and more seasoning is necessary. Also the self rising flour makes a great coating.",

I also find that flattening the breasts before breading helps with the cooking time.  For this, I just use the palm of my hand.  \r\n\r\nI would recommend browing 3-4 min per side before adding the champagne.  Add the champagne, bring to a boil and then reduce to simmer.  Simmer for 20 minutes so the chicken does not get overcooked.\r\n\r\nFlouring the breasts lightly is key to getting a sauce that has a nice consisentcy.  If you find your sauce is not at a desired thickness, carefully mix a tsp of flour with some sauce in a seperate cup and then add to the mixture.\r\n\r\nI don't use mushrooms in my sauce, but that is only because my DH doesn't care for them.  This is fantastic served over rice (boiled in chicken broth).  It has been a favorite of mine for a long time.",

I took under consideration other people's reviews which mentioned the recipe was a little bland and doesn't \"pop tastebuds\". I cooked everything the way it was specified but at the end I left the heavy cream to cook for about 8-9 minutes in a 13\" skillett (almost boiling the whole time) so that the cream would get a little heavier. I did a taste test half way through and decided to add about 1/3 cup champagne to the cream to make sure it wasn't too bland. The sauce consistency came out \"just right\". The taste was creamy with a hint of a sour (Champagne) undertone. Overall I was satisfied with this meal and Bu thought it was good as well - will make it again.",
