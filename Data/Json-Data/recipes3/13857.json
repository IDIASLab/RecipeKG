The main dish, or 'bouilli' - a platter of boiled meats and mixed vegetables - follows usually with gherkins and a variety of mustards, horseradish, and sauces alongside. The two courses can also be combined into one course. You can serve with more boiled carrots, leeks, parsnips, potatoes, and turnips, as well as boiled cabbage.",
