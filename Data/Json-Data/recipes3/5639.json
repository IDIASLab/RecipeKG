Janet Ballantyne of Garden's Way suggested baking washed beets for about 1 1/2 hours (when you have something else in the oven anyway). Make sure to leave the skins & tap root on and leave 1 inch of stem. Cool in cold water and the skins will slip off easily. Baking instead of boling results in less color and flavor loss.",
