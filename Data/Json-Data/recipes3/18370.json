Initially I was hesitant about the mint but it really blends in nicely with the other ingredients...certainly doesn't POP like you might expect it would. The honey helped with the sweetness of the veggies (I added carrots because i had them peeled and cut already... glad I did for an extra burst of color!) Everything about this was perfect in my opinion. Other than adding more veggies for more color/nutrition/variety I wouldn't change a thing!!",
