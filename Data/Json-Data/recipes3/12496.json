It might seem like there s going to be way too much tomato in proportion to the other ingredients but after everything is combined it s a perfect balance! Mine only sat for approx. 1 hour and we thought it was delicious as is. We have some leftover and I bet it tastes even better today. Paired very well with steaks -- Churrascaria-Style Picanha (from this site). Will make this again!",

The only bad thing about this is that it takes 25-35 min. to wash and dice everything up with only one person doing it. Great to make if you are taking something to a party but I would not recommend making it if you are preparing a party at home and making a lot of dishes. Takes too long to dice and you are ready for a nap after you do that.",
