I used about 3/8 c flour 1/2 tbs kosher salt 1 tbs of freshly ground black pepper & pepper medley. Used two bottles (24 ozs total) of lager beer to give more malty taste. Sub'd 1 10oz can of diced tomatoes with chopped jalapenos for the can of tomato sauce but kept the paste in. Added 1 tbs of Vindaloo curry 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce 2 cloves garlic 2 small chopped vidalia onions 1 cup of shredded red cabbage 1 16 oz package of frozen Italian blend veggies 2 bay leaves maybe 1 1/2 c diced potatoes used olive oil for the oil called for. I would call the result a thickened soup; not quite a stew but without adding any cornstarch or flour roux (beyond the floured meat to start) I thought it thickened up nicely. Thanks to the originator of this recipe and all who contributed other ideas.",
