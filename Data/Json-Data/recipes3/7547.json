I would suggest adding the salt to taste since the parmesan cheese has salt in it. I eat Pesto a lot and when I don't have the preferred pine nuts I substitute walnuts another common ingredient in Pesto. I find Pesto extremely versatile beyond it's common use over pasta and the base for a brochette. Use it as a sandwich spread tossed with vegetables like tomatoes spread over fish bake it on top of pita bread stuff a brie cheese with it. It stores in your refrigerator for several weeks and can be frozen as well. Oh and this whips up in under five minutes! This is part of my regular rotation inspired by what ingredients I have on hand to slather this onto!",
