He did think the dressing was a little heavy on the cilantro for his tastes but I thought it was just fine; in fact I thought the cumin was more prominent. I made this as directed with an attempt to arrange the various ingredients attractively on the lettuce. I also included additional optional toppings of cooked and crumbled bacon and crispy baked tortilla strips. For the meat I used No Name sirloin steaks (1 (6 oz.) steak was enough for the two of us) and for the seasoning I used Penzey's Fajita Seasoning. As for the lettuce (shhhh) I did not use Dole Just Lettuce preferring instead to use romaine lettuce. This was as delicious as it was attractive. It's been awhile since I've enjoyed a salad so much. (Note: So as not to overcook the steak I removed it from the pan before adding the peppers and onions. Once that was cooked I returned the steak to the pan.)",

I put out all of the components of this meal separately on the table (meat mixture in one bowl, cheese in another, tomatoes in another, etc.) along with salad and tortillas so the family could choose how to eat it. I had it just as a salad but I bet it would be great also in a tortilla with the dressing. Would definitely make again.

Except for a couple things: had some very rare steak left over from last night's dinner so I sliced that up and added it to the pan when the peppers and onions were close to being done. I had no Fajita seasoning so I did as others suggested and used taco seasoning instead. I had no plain yoghurt so I figured for the amount required along with the strength of the seasonings I could get away with using some stirred raspberry yoghurt. Other than that I followed the Southwest Fiesta Dressing recipe exactly. It was very good a perfect accompaniment. I served the whole thing on tortillas for an easy-to-go meal. My husband and I enjoyed it very much - I'll be making it again. One caveat - if serving in tortillas cut the meat up into bite-size pieces.",
