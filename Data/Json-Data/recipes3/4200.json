It was amazing. This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be a regular at our dinner table.

I cooked them until they were browned and just cooked enough to lift them without them crumbling. I actually backed off the amount of onion it calls for. I wound up using 1.5 onions and it was plenty! I also added some cayenne pepper garlic powder and sea salt to the beef mixture. It was still a tad bland but the grape sauce was the saving grace!",
