First off I suggest maybe using the pre-bought carmel for sundaes as it was pretty difficult to drizzle the microwaved caramel before it hardened. Secondly I got some comments that it was a bit too spicy and the crust was too hard to cut. I would consider cutting down the cinnamon and maybe the ginger in the filling. I would also probably add a bit of sugar to the crust as I saw a ginger snap/butter crust recipe on the box of ginger snaps and they added sugar to it. It was a bit overwhelming for some. Also I think it was too hard to cut because of the hardened caramel that you drizzle directly onto the crust. Be sparing with that. But it was good Id make it again!",
