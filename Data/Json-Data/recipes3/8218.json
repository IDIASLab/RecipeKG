I added a bit more oil to vegetables b/c they were sticking to bottom of pot, also I added scallops when I put the shrimp at the end. I substituted redfish for the snapper, b/c of price, but everything else I left the same until the end. After I did one last taste test, I added in about 2 tsp of garlic powder and left it that way. Thank you for this recipe.",

I was nervous about making it at first because I had never really made a stew before let alone something with this many ingredients, but it came out really tasty. I used swordfish instead of snapper because they did not have snapper at my local grocery store here in St. Louis, MO. I also added short neck clams, and medium size shrimp. I left all the shells on the shrimp and I'd recommend doing this because they were so perfectly cooked, but the downside is that you have to peel them which can be hot and messy. I added some pre-cooked lobster claws as more of a garnish than anything, but they didn't have any raw ones in the store. Instead of white vinegar I used Yellow Tail Chardonnay and it was perfect. I added a little more wine than necessary because I like my broth kind of runny. I used 3 organic bay leaves instead of 2, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Don't omit red pepper flakes. I am scared of spicy foods but just a pinch is enough to give it the necessary flavor and some of the spices cook off. I couldn't really find fish stock but there was something called \"seafood broth\" in the store so I used that. Clam juice would have worked too, maybe diluted with some water. I added more garlic than needed too. I might experiment next time with other spices but this is a perfect recipe! Use the freshest ingredients possible and follow the directions closely, you will not be disappointed, and there will be many left overs!",
