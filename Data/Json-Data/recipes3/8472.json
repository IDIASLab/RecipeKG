I substituted 2 Cups of whipping cream for 2 cups of the quart of milk, used twice the vanilla, and added a teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves. I also used regular unsweetened lowfat canned milk and added 1/4 Cup Splenda. I also used pasturized liquid eggs (Egg Beaters) instead of eggs for safety. Yummy nog and can be easily spiked, I'm sure.",

I also increased the vanilla. I increase the vanilla on any recipe I try that contains it though.",
