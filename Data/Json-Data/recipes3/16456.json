I have now taken it to two parties and have been asked for the recipe by so many people.  They are surprised at how easy it is.  The leek soup mix is the key ingredient, and tastes so much better than the vegetable (IMHO). I used a full 10 oz. package of spinach (it needs it for texture), and I doubled the recipe.  It works best if you squeeze as much liquid out of the spinach as you can.  If not it could turn out too runny. Overall, it's quick, easy, delicious, and will become a staple in my entertaining!",

I also almost doubled the water chestnuts.  It was so creamy and full of health with all the extra veggies!  Also used low-fat everything.... it was delicious and easy!!
