I did slice the carrots and parsnips in half long-ways and then cut them in half so my pieces were smaller.  I found they needed to cook longer, not sure why but it didn't matter. You could cut the baking time by steaming them a bit before baking if you wanted to be more precise about cooking time. I did stir them around a couple of times while they were baking.  The end result was really delicious.  We ate them along with old fashioned potato cakes (also from this site) -- my husband ate the meat we had too, but I made my meal out of these and the potato cakes.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing your recipe. Beats pickles and ice cream hands down!  :)",

Cut the carrots and parsnips into finger-sized pieces, and double the time, and you'll have lovely carmelized veggies.  In subsequent recipe attempts, however, I've found that adding about 1/2 tsp of crushed dried rosemary puts it over the top and makes it a 5+ star recipe.  The rosemary and honey combination are exquisite!",
