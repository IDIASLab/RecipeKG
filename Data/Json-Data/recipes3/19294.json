But then it's hard to go wrong when you're working with perfect luscious ingredients and proper method of cooking (although I cooked my chicken in half butter half olive oil at medium-high heat not low!) Using the best ingredients is key to getting the best results - no skimping! Use a good wine the same you'd drink. Prosciutto di Parma if your budget allows and the very best fontina cheese. Also being careful not to overcook the chicken results in its being fork tender. Lovely dish - I served it with a rainbow angel hair pasta and haricots verts.",

I added a little olive oil to the butter when cooking the chicken to keep the butter from burning. After browning the chicken I put it in a pan in the oven at 350 for awhile because I didnt feel 2 mins a side was enough and I was prepping the sauce etc. I had pancetta and no prosciutto so I cooked that up and crumbled it on top of the cheese and cooked the mushrooms a little while longer until almost all the liquid was gone. (the mushrooms were awesome!) This is a salty dish I had to catch my husband before he just did his usual shake of salt without tasting. My kids loved it without the mushrooms.

I served this with balsamic tomatoes with feta fresh sauteed asparagus and a caesar salad. I will absolutely make this recipe again. Thank you so much!",
