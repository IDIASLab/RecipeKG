I followed the directions to a T the only thing different was that I used cream of mushroom soup because my grocery store didn't carry cream of onion soup. I think what it was was the diced tomatoes with green chiles - it gave it a spicy Mexican flavor that just didn't jive with the rest of the soup. Also takes a lot longer in the crockpot than suggested. Definitely won't be making this again.",
