Knowing this would be awfully rich I chose not to include the chocolate chips but aside from that I made the cake exactly as directed. I baked it in two 9\" layer cake pans and used the frosting on top and in between the layers. Chopped toasted hazelnuts and Hershey's Almond Kisses garnished the top. It was a lovely and impressive presentation! Uncertain of all that liqueur I skeptically tasted a slice before I gave it to hubs to take to the office. Wow! It was much better than I expected. It wasn't as \"boozy\" as I thought it would be and the three different flavored liqueurs all blended nicely into something really unique. The frosting was creamy and fluffy almost mousse like and complimented the cake nicely. Magnificent different moist and flavorful cake!",
