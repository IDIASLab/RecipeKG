We used everything but the cornstarch and added instead at the end more Parmesan to thicken the sauce and turned the heat up high.  This thickened it instantly.  We also added spinach to the mushrooms for another healthy vegetable.  We LOVED it! My boyfriend said it was better than the expensive Italian food we go out to.",

To thicken it I used the cornstarch (mixed with cold water) and parmesan cheese along with increasing the heat a little. I also added chunks of cooked chicken and served it over whole wheat angel hair. I forgot to add the salt but that way each family member can add it to taste. We will definitely have this again!",
