Like previous reviewers I had to add much more quantity than called for.  I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter, 3/4 cup of dry white wine, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, 4 cloves of garlic and 1/3 cup of grated Asiago cheese (be sure to use the good cheese, I tried using the cheap stuff once and instead of melting it just congealed into a big ball in the sauce - this never happened with good quality Asiago).  I also add 1 tsp. each of dried basil and oregano. I also use mushrooms too.  If you like it spicy try using a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. This makes a decadent sauce that my brother says he dreams about.",

I used 6 cloves of garlic as well.\n\nI would suggest that you don't use pre cooked shrimp. Cooking the shrimp in the sauce takes only minutes and the shrimp absorb the flavour much nicer this way. We also COVERED it with fresh parm! Make this recipe, you will enjoy it!\n\nUpdate: I have cooked this over 10 times now. I still use tons of garlic. And now I add a bunch of cream to it as well. Yes, even more fattening. However, it is delicious this way. The cream helps hold together all of the ingredients so they don't just sink to the bottom. Yummy!",
