The sour cream really cuts down on the heavy mayo flavor that is in most salads.  I believe the celery salt and dill are imperative.  I understand leaving things out or adding things because of a personal preference but I wish those that made modifications would not rate recipes.  Sometimes leaving out something minor could make a big difference.  Trust me, spend the couple extra bucks to buy all of the ingredients for this and you will not be disappointed.",

She\u2019s got the perfect measurements of each of the ingredients.  I wouldn\u2019t alter that a bit.  But while I didn\u2019t change anything (except for using a couple less eggs and fresh, rather than dried dill) I did add some things to dress it up a bit.  Some thinly sliced radishes, sliced green onion, a few slices of cooked and crumbled bacon, about 2 T. creamy horseradish sauce and some Jane\u2019s Krazy Mixed Up Salt really made the flavor pop and made a good potato salad even better.  My favorite part of this recipe is the half and half mixture of sour cream and mayonnaise.  It was creamy and still had a slight tang from the mayo without it being overbearing.",

My two sons helped me make this salad from start to finish. I made a few small changes due to what I had on hand--I increased the celery to two large stalks green onions instead of white used Beau Monde seasoning instead of celery salt (Beau Monde seasoning is basically celery salt and onion powder) and because my son asked I threw in about six chopped garlic dills. This was quite good though I think it could use a little more spicing up. Next time I make this I think I'll add some garlic powder chives and a little Frank's Hot Sauce. As is quite good. The amounts of mayo/sour cream were absolutely spot on. I'm glad that the submitter added the footnote about making it ahead of time. I think that's what makes this salad. My sons and I really enjoyed making this together and we all (me especially) appreciated the ease of this recipe.",
