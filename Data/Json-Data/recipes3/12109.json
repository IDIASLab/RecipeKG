I messed with the veggies, using snow peas and bean sprouts and I didn't have any red cabbage so I doubled the green cabbage. I also added hot peppers. I used marinated steak that I had sliced super thin instead of ground beef (didn't have any on hand). The \"sauce\" is pretty darn tasty. The addition of the lime and cilantro is key here. Adding all the other veggies though, I think, kept it away from being a \"slaw\" and more a stir-fry-still good but I veered it away from its original intention. The taste is addictive, refreshing and crisp. It served nicely with a cold beer. Thank you for the recipe.",

I increased the ginger and garlic to 4 tbsp.  I also used 2 lbs of thinly sliced beef.  I kept the cabbage amounts the same.  The cilantro and lime hits are a must at the end.  I bet those who say that they feel something is missing probably skipped the fresh cilantro and lime juice.  It really does make a difference.  I will likely add cayenne to it next time as we love heat around here.",

I used about 1/4 cup gluten free tamari soy sauce since that's what I had left and used Trader Joe's Coconut amminos for the remaining amount, which were really good and had a hint of sweetness with the savory flavor of soy sauce without the soy. Highly recommend it. Also used Trader Joe's sirracha sauce for the hot sauce called for. Added quite a bit since we like it fairly spicy. Definitely add the fresh lime juice and cilantro as called for, as it boosts the flavor. I also added some sesame seeds and liked that addition. My husband thought this was great and said he'd eat it again for sure! It's a winner a our house",
