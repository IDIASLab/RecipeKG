It makes a great alternative to coleslaw with burgers, or to serve with eastern European fare like pieroge or latkes.",

The celery root is a must I think it adds a pepperiness that is just lovely. I thought the sauce was very sour due to equal amounts of Olive Oil and Cider Vinegar. I've made the recipe a second time and replaced the olive oil with some mayo and added less cider vinegar; the rest of the dressing I left the same. Another wonderful addition is some diced red bell pepper (in my case instead of the beet) this adds crunch and sweetness without adding more sugar.",
