There are a lot of ingredients but it comes together very quickly and is beautiful to boot! That said I had to make some changes... no collard greens or romaine at the store so I used boxed spring mix and more kale; no orange pepper; toasted almond slivers instead of walnuts; half a small red cabbage; cut the oregano to 1/2 tsp (I don't like oregano). Leftovers are okay because the dressing doesn't soak everything. Just incredible!",
