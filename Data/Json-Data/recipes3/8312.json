I whisked the eggs with a bit of milk in order to get them nice and fluffy. I also added some cherry tomatoes for a little color and flavor. I fried the bacon separately and didn't bother chopping it but left it in strips. I cut the pitas in half and filled them then placed the bacon and cheese inside and WOW - delicious! Sorry Heinz but I left the ketchup on the side for dipping... but I must say I'm a huge fan of the stuff!",
