After reading the reveiws, I sliced the tofu to 1/4 inch thickness, pressed the slices with paper towel to absorb moisture, froze for 30 minutes on a cookie sheet, then removed and dipped in flour, then egg, then crumbs.  Rather than frying, I baked the tofu at 350 degrees for 15 minutes each side, on a cookie sheet rubbed lightly with olive oil.  The pieces did not break, and came out crispy and delicious.  I then layered the ingredients as follows in a large loaf pan: tomato sauce, half the tofu, half the cheese, repeat. For those who are interested in macronutrient composition, this came out as 30% protein, 30% carbs, 40% fat (with low fat cheese and baked, not fried). It was perfect, and, yes, my carnivorous boyfriend loved it.  Would be great for guests, as the breading and assembly can be done ahead.",

Some very important changes:  After slicing the tofu, press the slices gently between paper towels to drain the water.  Then BAKE IT on a nonstick sheet until it begins to turn golden. You will thank me. Yes, I bake it before frying it... the baking is not instead of frying.  the extra step just makes the texture SO much better... I cook w/ tofu in this way alot. Also, like other reviewers said, I dip the tofu slices in egg before breading and have NO issues w/ the breading coming off while frying.",

Pat the tofu dry (kitchen paper towel). Then place them in freezer bags or plastic wrap and place them in the freezer overnight or at least for 8 hours. when ready to use place the tofu in a deep bowl and pour boiling water over the tofu. Pat dry tofu the coat it with the breadcrumbs. If the breadcrmbs don't stick spray the tofu cuts with cooking spray. I baked mine in the oven on a cookie tray sprayed with cooking oil. The texture after doing this process makes it a million times better. Good luck.",
