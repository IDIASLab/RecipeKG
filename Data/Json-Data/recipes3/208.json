My only suggestions are to make sure you don't over-mix the whip cream and if you are making this for a party try using individual-sized graham cracker crusts (sold in pckgs of 6 at WalMart). Doing so keeps the presentation looking so much better. This is definitely a keeper!",

Meaning I added 1/4C lemon juice blended in in step one and 1/2C chopped maraschino cherries added with pineapple. It was good but next time I will leave out the cool whip--it iz only to make it creamier and it seemed to really tone down the flavor which was awesome before I added that. And I admit I've never been much of a cool whip person anyway! Will save calories as if that matters at that point LOL by cutting it altogether--will make for a firmer end product too.",
