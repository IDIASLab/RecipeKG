I took a cup of chocolate chips and a tablespoon of vegetable shortening, microwaved it all for 30 seconds, stirred and again for 30 seconds. I dipped half of each cookie in the chocolate and set the cookies on waxed paper, decorated them with sprinkles and set them in the fridge for 20-25 minutes. YUM! Wonderful! Very easy recipe to follow, dough was easy to work with and baked beautifully!",
