I'm not entirely sure I made it right so I wish I could review it without rating it; I used almond paste and I'm not sure if that's the same thing as almond butter. Regardless it came out pretty good. I don't think I'll make this again before winter and I'll probably wait until we have guests over because this was a tad extravagant for just two people and the leftovers were just odd to me.",
