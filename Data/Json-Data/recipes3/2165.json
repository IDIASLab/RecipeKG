I had never made it before but my grandmother used to prepare it like this whenever my grandpa brought trout home from fishing trips. I did cut off the heads and tails before frying. Also frying the fish on high heat generated a lot of smoke and caused my smoke alarm to go off. The fish got so black on the outside and my home got so smoky that I ended up completing the cooking in the oven. However the result was a very tasty fish - my husband loved it as well.",
