The Bunny Bennington orchestra came in to the restaurant at closing time and the chef whipped this up from what he had on hand.  I add a tablespoon of dry Marsella wine while the onions and meat are browning. I beat the eggs together as you would for scrambled eggs and stir into the mix at the end. Just before serving I add pine nuts and Parmesan cheese. Everyone loves it!",

Now I always loved this dish but it is better made with fresh spinach saute the mushrooms with some butter seperatly and then you can top with some shredded cheddar or parmesan cheese and season liberally with salt and pepper. Pretty good and pleasing all around with some practice and something that as a kid we all looked forward to and as an adult is still fun to make. Can also be done with sausage for a different taste.",

I used 1/2 lb ground beef and eyeballed the veggies based on what we had scraps of in the fridge - lots of spinach 2 big mushrooms 1/2 an onion and 1/4 green pepper - 2 cloves of garlic and 2 eggs. I followed the recipe exactly (true with a small variation in vegetables) until the very end. I may have turned my stove on too high in the beginning because by the time the onion cooked clear I thought the meat was very well-done. When the egg started taking a long time to cook I didn't want the meat to go bad so I ended up scrambling it a bit. Next time I'll turn my eletric stove on 5 from the start rather than 7 (medium high). Still it was so tasty and easy!",

When I was a kid my mom made something similar to this but instead of using spinach she used chopped zucchini (maybe because my father LOVED zucchini!). The funny thing is WE called it \"Joe's Special \" and we lived in a suburb of San Francisco! After reading this recipe I have made it now both with zucchini and spinach and it is great both ways! Tonight while we were eating it I thought it might be great with salsa in it and my husband suggested making it with sausage instead of hamburger. As another reviewer said this is a pretty versatile recipe as any number of alterations can be made to it and it is still delicious! Thanks for sharing it!",
