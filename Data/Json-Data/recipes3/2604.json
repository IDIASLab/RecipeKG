I would in that case add even more tomato paste and simmer the sauce until it is a little on the thick side but still has some liquid. Hope that helps.

I was in high school and actually threw dinner parties for my friends and my specialty was lasagna - made from a fab recipe I got, I think, off the box of lasagna noodles. After trying several different recipes from this site, this is the WINNER. If it is not the exact same recipe I used 'back then,' it is very close. Very flavorful, cheesy and gets rave reviews every time. None of the other lasagna recipes I tried (and I tried several in advance of a big dinner party I was having) came even close -they were either bland or runny or both. This is the most like a lasagna you would get if you went to a good Italian restaurant.",

I think if I were to do it again I'd just use straight mozzerella and not bother with trying to make a sauce. I didn't have any tomato paste and I used canned diced tomatoes thinking it would even out. It ended up being very liquidy instead and it made the noodles soggy. I ended up throwing away my portion and my husband thought it was so-so. I give it three stars only because it could have been better were it not for some error on my part. Would have been less disappointing if it didn't take so long to make but that's the nature of lasgne!",
