I couldn't wait 2 whole weeks to give it a taste so I dipped my spoon into it to try and ended up making sandwiches with it as soon as it came out of the blender. I used it on sharp cheddar and pastrami sandwiches and it held up very well against those strong flavored foods. My husband says we will NEVER purchase mustard again. I highly recommend making this if you enjoy a good hardy mustard!",

Try as I might I simply could not find ANY of the type of mustard seed this recipe calls for but since I was too impatient to order online I used simply \"mustard seed\" from my bulk store and \"hot mustard powder\" to replace the Oriental seed (as I gather they are the spicier of the three). The taste is simply incredible and like Rachael I couldn't wait two weeks to try it! I doubled the recipe and got perfectly enough to fill three 500 ml wide mouth jars. I used 1 tsp of \"hot mustard powder\" for the doubled recipe and got a very noticeable ZING (no complaints here!) but for those that prefer a milder mustard (and couldn't find the original mustard seeds called for and must substitute) they may want to start with 1/2 or even 1/4. I am so thrilled with how this turned out that I too will never purchase a grainy mustard again! Thanks so much I am so pleased! Update: This tasted spicier at first now after maturing it is more mellow...still 'tangy' but not hot. So next time I won't reduce the hot mustard powder and may even add more!",

And it was rather easy to make...but I goofed on the 1st batch. I forgot the honey and it was totally a hot firecracker. It still has a bite even with the honey but it's all good. Now I choose to make 2 batches because I have a kid allergic to apples and I wanted her to be able to enjoy the mustard and not be told sorry can't eat it. So I made a batch with Distilled White Vinegar and that's the one I forgot to add the honey. And it was flaming. The 2nd batch with the Apple Cider vinegar is the one I added a sugar free honey and it was also when I realized I forgot the honey on the 1st. I pulsed and grinded the mustard down as far as I could. We love it....You can totally leave out the Oriental mustard seeds if need be that's where this recipe gets it's heat. I'm totally tickled stumbling across this recipe. It's a total keeper and it also helps with other ideas for mustards. Pelicangal I salute your recipe. If I can make my family mustard verses buying it in the store. I've saved some money. Because the seeds in bulk the ingredients that went with it sure makes up the difference. I don't mind making fresh when it's this easy. TY!",
