I found it bland until I got up in the middle of dinner and added chopped orange segments to it.  Next time I will try it with some orange juice mixed into the vinegar/oil.  We also ate it over chopped romaine for a full salad effect. I will definitly make this recipe again, but with changes to add flavor.  Perfect for left over rotisserie chicken.
