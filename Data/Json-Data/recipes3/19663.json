My whole family loved it, including my mother who HATES mayonnaise. It was very light and flavorful, and didn't have the nasty aftertaste macaroni salad usually does. I did make a few changes though.  I found that using only 1 tbsp of (extra virgin) olive oil and vinegar was sufficient.  I also added a tsp of black pepper and half of 1/8 of a tsp of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick, and whisked all the dressing ingredients together before adding it to the macaroni mixture.  I omitted the dried minced onion and cucumbers, and added some scallions along with celery and shredded carrots.  16 oz. of pasta turned out to be too much, so I only used 8.  I will DEFINITELY continue to make this.  Even if you're not a fan of the traditional macaroni salads, which are usually heavy, you will LOVE this!",
