Except for perhaps reducing the amount of fat (butter) or adding salt (depending on the amount of sodium in your canned tomatoes), this recipe is all about the gloriously subtle richness of tomatoes, onion, vodka, and cream.

After I added the cream I added sliced fresh mushrooms and mussels shrimp and calamari rings along with a touch of cayenne pepper to add just a hint of heat. Next time I would use fresh garlic and add it to the onions. I also would use a bit less butter or substitute olive oil instead. I would also add either the mushrooms OR the seafood but not both.
