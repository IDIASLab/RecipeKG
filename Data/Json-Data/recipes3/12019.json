The biggest problem is it calls for way too much cream/milk making it totally soupy and tasteless. I would cut the milk/cream down to 1 cup and add more if needed. The second issue is there is too much cooking time for the shrimp making the shrimp tough. I would add the shrimp in the last 5 minutes of cook time.",
