I used frozen peas and warmed them through with the butter and half the lemon I zested, and used the other half of the lemon juice with the cheese sauce to boost the acidity. The mint is an absolute must - it felt almost like a sharp peppery spice on my tongue. Loved and will be making again in the spring with fresh peas and new veg!",
