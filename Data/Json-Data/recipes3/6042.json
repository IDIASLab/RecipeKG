Then I added the sour cream and it made a beautiful sauce. I served the fish with a side of egg noodles and spooned the sauce over the entire dish. A couple of basil leaves and my family scarfed it down. A and easy to make! Thanks",

I used diced plum tomatoes and per some other suggestions by reviewers added a little more garlic chopped red onion and basil to this recipe. Before I baked the tilapia for the first ten minutes I seasoned it with just a little sea salt and a good amount of fresh ground black pepper then drizzled just a little olive oil over it and a tiny bit of butter. This was delicious. My only suggestion would be to be sure you are liberal with your spices when you make this. Thanks for a great recipe!",
