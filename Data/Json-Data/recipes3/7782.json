This recipe was exactly what I needed tonight &ndash; something that involves a little bit of real cooking, fresh seafood, and a ton of flavor.  I will have to keep this one in mind for the upcoming summer evenings. If scallops aren't your thing, try this recipe with jumbo prawns, calamari, or even grilled octopus!",

In relation to the salsa I replaced the cilantro with half as much dried basil canned pineapple as opposed to fresh and increased the red pepper flakes (or chili flakes as they're labeled here) to 1/4 teaspoon as we like a little more heat. When the shallots were soft I added all the salsa ingredients to the pan and heated them through took them off the heat and placed them in a bowl. This helped keep things relatively at the same temperature and did not affect taste. I decided not to buy safflower oil just for this recipe and substituted canola oil. Overall we felt the ginger was a little too much and that the green beans needed more flavour (maybe a dash or so of salt and pepper would've done the trick). I would definitely make this again especially since it would easily impress guests.",

The only thing I think i might have changed is that we used frozen french beans after having steamed them in the steamer...we had fresh \\green beans in the fridge and I wish that I had trimmed the ends and sliced them in the french style cut. I could say much more but I'll summarize by stating that: The flavor once again was unforgettable and I recommend everyone try this recepie.",

I was worried that the salsa would not come together at first but after 30 minutes in the fridge it was very good. Less oil would have been much better though since I think the honey and cider are enough liquid to bring the ingredients together. I cooked only one scallop by this method and it came out dark brown which I think was the intention. It also smoked up my whole apartment so I cooked the remaining scallops over low heat. The green beans were nothing special just steamed green beans. I think I will try tossing some garlic in with them on the last saute next time.",
