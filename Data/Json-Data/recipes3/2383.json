I cut the celery back to one cup and since I didn't have low-fat plain yogurt on hand I subbed low fat mayo. I added some fresh lemon juice and a bit of dijon mustard along with some parsley. (similar to Tarragon Tuna Salad from this site). I left out the almonds and let this set in the fridge for a couple hours to let the flavors blend. Great on toasted whole grain bread!",

I added everything in this recipe but instead of almonds i added pecans cuz thats what i had. I also added a tspn of mayo to my yogurt and sour creAM for a light tangy flavor w/o actually overpowering it with mayo. I also added freshly ground black pepper and dash or two of onion powder and i used fresh tarragon and dried chives cuz thats all i had onhand. As a person who loves chicken salad but alot of times it either tastes too chickeny or too mayoey this one is perfect and delicious! Screw the deli i will make this from now on! I also didnt measure any of my ingredianets except for the yogurt/mayo/sourcream mix.",
