I browned the chicken and used italian bread crumbs. Then instead of baking it in a bowl I mixed the whole can of soup half the onion soup a very big tablespoon of sour cream about a quarter cup white wine and 3/4 of the can of water and mixed together. After that I poured the soup mixture into the pan with the chicken and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes. I made rice on the side and also made busicuits. There was enough gravy for everything and it was amazing!! Thanks for the idea!!!!",
