In my opinion I think you need more kraut for the amount of meat and potatoes. I used a 36 oz. bag (recipe calls for 22 oz.) and felt there could be more. Next time I'll definitely parboil the potatoes as they were a bit hard. Also I might use a trick of Mom's by adding some shredded cabbage to the kraut to tone down the sourness as well as add more substance.",

Next time though I will use bavarian saurkraut as this will give this recipe just the right sweet-sour flavor I was looking for since it has that flavor to begin with. Slightly sweet but tart-but not too much of either. mmmmm I think that is the way it is supposed to be but with so many different types of saurkraut these days it can really affect the flavor. I also like to add a chicken bullion and a cup or 2 of water for richness and broth. If you don't like the flavor you can adjust it with either vinegar for tartness or brown sugar for sweetness. I like it to taste like New Years day-only with a broth!",
