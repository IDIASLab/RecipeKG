Once that's done we toss the meat in the tequila/lime juice/sauce/veggie and put it in a tortilla with rice, sour cream, salsa, and cheese.  It's AMAZING!!!  This spice combo is delicious.",

I did make changes as I didn't have lime juice, but I did have margarita mix, so I marinated the steak in patron tequila, (which I am sure made a difference, don't use tequila you don't like the taste of) and margarita mix and it was really good!! I also had a pack of fajita seasoning I threw in, and I had never used liquid smoke before but I didn't notice a really smokey or off taste at all from it. I also didn't add as much oil like others said, maybe 2 tbsp, just because I didn't want my vegies slimy, and I added just a little more worcestershire and liquid smoke just so it had enough liquid. I also added a tiny pinch of corn starch because it did seem really runny, like a water consistancy, may have just been from the veggies watering it down, I am not sure...I made some fresh tortillas, and topped with some sour cream!!! My husband and I really enjoyed this!! Thanks!!!",
