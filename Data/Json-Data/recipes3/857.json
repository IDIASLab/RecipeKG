What a keeper! Just make sure you season your chicken well before adding to recipe. I just bake mine with a little fresh ground pepper, poultry seasoning, garlic salt and cracked red pepper before baking. I will make this again and again! (No boil lasagna noodles work great with this and cut the work down!)",

I cooked two frozen breasts in a little broth for chicken which was plenty added the broth to sauce about half cup. I used some leftover evaporated milk and whole milk total about 1 cup. Wasn't sure about the cottage cheese but mooshed it a little with a fork and then combined with other cheeses - I cut down on the cheddar and used some italian mix. Seemed easier than traditional lasagna somehow but probably the same amount of work. My husband liked it but not the kids though they don't like much.",
