If you do make it as is put your toothpicks into the peanut butter balls before refrigerating. I did this and it helped keep them on the toothpicks. The flavor is excellent. They're just a little difficult to work with. I also found that the recipe makes far more than listed. I used a small cookie scoop to keep them all the same size and I got 153 buckeyes out of it rather than the 60 stated on the recipe.",
