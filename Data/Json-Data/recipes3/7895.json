I heard that these ingredients were the secret to winning a chili cookoff. WELL lets just say I'll never make a recipe to serve (especially to be judged) without giving it a trial run first. The people were commenting on the flavor while taste-testing my chili (and not in a good way). Over all the recipe was a flop. People were warning others not to even try this one. So glad it was anonymous! I dumped it when I got home.",
