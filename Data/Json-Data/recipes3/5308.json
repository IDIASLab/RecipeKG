After days of restaurant meals I was in the mood for a quick, good, home-cooked dinner but I wasn't about to go grocery shopping.  This chicken dish was just what I needed.  It contained ingredients I always have on hand.  I love the simplicity of not just the preparation, but of the flavors.  I don't need lots of bold seasoning to please my palate.  A little wine, a little garlic and I'm happy.  I said I wanted quick,  so I butterflied the chicken breasts, which not only reduced the cooking time, but also ensured they cooked evenly. For good, golden color I dredged them in flour before I pan seared them. Served this with the simple and basic \"Parsleyed Rice Pilaf\" also from this site.",

I used a full cup of chicken broth and added water to cut the saltiness. My family prefers thicker pieces of chicken so I didn't thin them and simmered everything together for the duration of cook time. I added some mushrooms and a heaping tbsp of flour to thicken the sauce and at the end topped each chicken breast with a folded slice of havarti cheese and let some of it melt into the sauce. Delicious!",
