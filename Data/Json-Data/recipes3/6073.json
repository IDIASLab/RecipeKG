I also think more effort should be made to thicken the sauce -- 2 cups of milk heated and stirred for 3 minutes gives 3 cups of hot milk. The end result is a very hot runny and fairly colorless liquid soup with tuna eggs etc. If I were to do this again I'd begin with a bechamel sauce and add cream or whole milk a few tablespoons at a time if needed. I'd also skip baking it in the oven.",
