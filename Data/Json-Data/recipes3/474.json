I know it's not a very Christmas-y dessert but I wanted something completely different from the half-dozen things we had for dessert on Thanksgiving. I made the lemon variety and it was amazing! One could make this cake in such a variety of flavors limited only by what extracts you can find. I do have some advice regarding the frosting though. Make this cake the day (or at last many hours) before you are going to serve it. Chill the frosting for at least an hour before putting it on the cake as it will firm up and be able to support the layers better (allowing you to put more between each layer). Frost the cake reserve the leftover frosting and chill. When you serve it frost it again using as much of the frosting as you can. Its not sweet so don't be afraid to use LOTS of frosting. That's why the recipe makes as much frosting as it does because its GOOD. There's no need to waste it.",

My only suggestion is to cut down the recipe for the icing...unless you plan on icing more than your cake. I would say half everything and it should be more than enough without extra containers of it left over. This is the PERFECT orange cream cake and does really taste like the summertime favorite!",

The things changed are: I doubled the amount of extract in both the cake and icing (add to taste), I also added non-flavored gelatin (1 - 2 pkgs) in the icing (icing is a little thin), added food coloring to the icing to make it the color of the orange of a cream sickle and I used a white cake mix. It was perfect!! The icing is a little thin, even after setting, without the gelatin. I love the icing because it is not a real sweet icing. My daughter and I usually share a piece of cake, I eat the cake and she eats the icing. There will be NO SHARING TODAY. lol For an added twist I made a coconut cream version of this as well by: where ever it says water/milk I used coconut milk (canned of course, I'll try fresh next time, lol) and I used coconut extract (still doubling of course), as well as the gelatin, top with coconut and this is a coconut cake to die for!!!",

The frosting really has that creamsicle flavor that is so yummy! I chilled the cake briefly to make it easier to cut the layers.

I couldn't get mine to set up firm enough to stay on the cake (even after letting the frosting sit in the fridge for 5 hours) so I added in a packet of unflavored gelatin and stuck it in the fridge for another 1/2 hour. After letting the frosted cake refrigerate overnight it held up beautifully even when cut. Co-workers raved and it's perfect for the 100 degree weather we're having! I decorated it with orange slice gummy candies so it didn't look like a white blob and people couldn't believe I made it.",

So I used white cake instead of the orange and added orange juice instead of the milk as one reviewer suggested. I still used the orange extract in the cake but made a completely different frosting. I used a cream cheese frosting from this site and added a little bit more vanilla and powdered sugar than it called for to bring out the vanilla and have a good contrast between the orange and vanilla. After frosting the cupcakes I put an orange slice gummy on each (as another reviewer had done). These were sooooooo good and everyone at our BBQ loved them. I will definitely be making these again!",

                "reviewBody": "I rated based on the exact recipe. Makes ALOT of frosting. Which could be a bad or good based on how much you wanna eat frosting! The frosting is also very very runny. It would be great for a sheet cake style cake but NOT a layer cake which I did. I had to make last minute adjustments that saved it! I placed skewers through the cake layers to keep it from sliding. And keep in mind all the layers were chilled overnite along with the frosting and it still was way too runny! I would advise to make a stablized whipped topping (16 oz. heavy whipping cream)from scratch then use only 8 oz. sourcream. I am a seasoned professional baker so I'm not speaking from lack of experience. The flavors are a wonderful combo! And if you need a luscious summer dessert in a hurry go for it! COLD refrigeration is KEY!!",
