There was the obvious hesitation to try from those who don't like liver but the bacon really hides the liver flavor quite nicely. Actually a couple of folks tried it and didn't like liver and they were pleasently surprised. I did use lite syrup as opposed to honey and I liked it much better as did my guests. Overall quite good and I'll use it again. The liver was a little messy to wrap but the end result was quite nice.",
