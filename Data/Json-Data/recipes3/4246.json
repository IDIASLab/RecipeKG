I made it a few weeks before as a trial run and decided that I needed to make some changes.  First change, I baked the DEEP PIE SHELL in the oven (unfilled) at around 325 or 350 for 10-15 minutes.  Second, I reduced the half-and half to 1 1/2 cups and increased the eggs to 5.  We found the quiche to be too custardy during our trial run.  Third, we shredded around 8 oz of gruyere cheese. We didn't use it all, but mixed the amount that we wanted with the eggs.  That way the bottom of the crust doesn't get too mushy.  We placed ham on the top of the quiche and cooked it. (It will displace during cooking.) As far as the cooking temp and time, fool around with it. Drop the temp and prepare to cook longer.  I say drop the temp b/c you don't want your pie shell to get too dark around the edges. I would say that it probably took us somewhere around 1 hr in cooking time. Final result - everyone was asking for the recipe!",

I used prepared pie crusts and half milk for the filling and the results still came out very custardy with a soft, toothsome texture.  In combination with the fillings I added (diced ham, onion, broccoli, mushroom), the egg/milk mixture was enough to fill up 2 quiches.  My husband and kids loved this; we ate both entire quiches for dinner.  Only suggestion was that the quiche needs cooking a little longer than directed: after the 25 minutes at 350, they were still gelatinous and not set.  I turned up the heat to 375 and cooked for 20 minutes more and they came out lovely, fragrant and savory.  Can't wait to try this recipe again with other fillings.",
