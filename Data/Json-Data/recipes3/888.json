Growing up I remember my Dad often made American Chop Suey for lunch with a salad; it was made with elbow macaroni. When I chose this recipe I had only skimmed it very briefly- I had already started cooking the macaroni and had my veggies diced when I took a closer look and saw that the only pasta it calls for...comes from a can??? Like Franco-Americo or Chef Boyardee? I had to tweak the recipe from there but the results were just like Dad used to make! Thanks for the trip down memory lane and the inspiration to recreate my Dad's recipe. See what I ended up doing on my Custom Recipe: on the bottom of the recipe page click the \"Custom Verstions\" tab for Lacky's American Chop Suey.",
