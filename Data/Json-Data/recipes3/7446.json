I never grew up eating fried chicken and my husband had a craving for some good \"Southern-Sytle\" fried chicken so I read through a bunch of recipes but obviously knew that fried chicken has to be moist my on the inside and the breading has to be thick enough to stand up to the frying process so it can be crunchy on the outside. This recipe is perfect because it has a buttermilk marinade. I put the cut up chicken in a glass bowl and filled it with the marinade. I turned the chicken a few times during 6 hours. I drained the chicken in a colander and patted it dry then breaded it in the flour. For the flour mixture I used 3 cups flour, 1 Tbsp. garlic powder, 1 Tbsp. onion powder, 2 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. salt. 1 tsp. pepper. I then follwed the steps outlined in this recipe. We used an electric fryer so our cooking time was a bit less than 30 minutes. You have to watch your chicken closely. I don't know which I like better -fried chicken that's fresh out of the frier warm or cold out of the fridge the next day. Either way, I'm hooked! Thanks for a wonderful recipe that definitely makes \"Southern-Sytle Buttermik Fried Chicken\"!",

Also, it should be noted that this is not a quick dish to make, legs and thighs can take up to 15-20 mins and if you're doing this in small batches, you'll be cooking for awhile.  I did my frying in a cast iron dutch oven the grill - hardest part was regulating the oil's temperature.  Any more than 350-360 degrees and the batter will burn before the chicken is cooked.  Any less and the chicken will absorb too much oil.   Also, I did not double-dip, the butterilk was so thick and held so much flour that I felt it unnecessary.  The baking powder really makes the batter increase in volume while cooking - don't leave it out!  I will definitely make this again but with a bit more spice in the flour.",

I found that if I leave the chicken out after coating for about 30 minutes or so the batter clings MUCH better and you don't lose any in the oil which causes burnt crumbs and shortens the oil's life.  I have started using Canola oil which really seems to handle high temps without smoking.  After 40 years of frying chicken I think I have it mastered.....it took a LOT of trials and errors !!!  You don't even want to HEAR about my first batch of fried chicken....let's just say I found out that you can't fry even SLIGHTLY frozen chicken.  It mat be pretty and brown on the outside but........use your imagination !!!",

                "reviewBody": "Oh my GOODNESS!  This recipe makes phenomenal chicken fingers!!  I used two 16oz. packages of free range chicken tenderloins which ended up being about 18 in number.  I mixed up the buttermilk marinade using 1/2 and 1/2 spicy brown and dijon mustards.  I added about a teaspoon of a spice mixture I use for regular roasted chicken in addition to the spices called for and also used a tad less cayenne because I didn't want overkill for my kids, and it was the perfect amount of kick.  I let the tenderloins sit in the marinade in the fridge for about 6 hours before breading them.  In the breading mixture I added 1 tsp. each paprika, salt, and white pepper.  I grabbed each tenderloin and tossed them one at a time in the flour mixture before letting them \"set\" on a cookie sheet sprinkled with more flour.  To fry I only used about a cup of Spectrum palm oil shortening (it is non-hydrogenated) in a hefty saute pan over medium high heat.  I flipped the fingers when the edges were opaque and the bottoms were deep golden brown.  (It easily took less than 4 minutes per side.)  I did about 6 fingers per batch and drained them on paper towels layered over a cooking rack.  They fried up quickly - the first tenders out of the pan were still warm by the end of the third batch.  These were INCREDIBLE. They FAR outdid the best chicken tenders we have ever had with our kids at any restaurant (even high end places couldn't top this!).  It made a little mess, but at the end it was totally worth it!!",
