Perhaps draining the canned tomatoes would have helped. \n\nIt had odd ingredients (like sweet potato, mushrooms, and ground chicken) for chili but I found it interesting enough to give it a try. \n\nChanges made to the recipe: \n*Foster Farms Fresh & Natural Cage Free ground chicken used \n\n* ground mustard seed used \n\n* 1 teaspoon each kosher salt and black pepper \n\n* substituted 1 orange bell pepper for the 4 jalapenos to make this recipe more kid eating friendly Recommend: making this on the stove to control overall cooking time and reduce the liquid.",
