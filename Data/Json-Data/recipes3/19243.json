With just a few minor modifications it makes an excellent family meal; my husband loved it and my kids (who are very picky eaters) ate it up! I recommend using four boneless chicken breast halves instead of eight roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular variety and water instead of milk. Also I cooked this meal in the crock pot on HIGH for five (5) hours (instead of on low for twice that time) - the chicken was moist and the potatoes were soft with just the right amount of sauce (or gravy). It actually exceeded my expectatons and turned out to be a very flavorful and filling meal! No leftovers!:)",

Rinse, pat dry.\n7 med red potatoes, scrubbed, skin on & cubed (no larger than \u00be\u201d)\n2 (10.75 oz) cans Campbell\u2019s healthy choice (low fat/sodium) cream of mushroom soup.\n1 soup can water (filtered if you have it)\n3 heaping tablespoons of the packaged dry onion mix\n2 cups fresh green beans (tips removed, beans cut in half)\n2 cups baby carrots\nTarragon and garlic powder - divided, sea salt, fresh ground pepper and paprika\n\nLayered ingredients starting with green beans, potatoes, carrots.  Sprinkle over veggies: 1/8 teaspoon Tarragon, pinch of garlic powder, light on the salt & pepper.  Lay chicken pieces over veggies making sure thickest part of chicken points towards crock-pot wall.  \n\nMix together the 2 cans of soup, 1 can water, 3 tablespoons of dry onion soup, 1/8 tarragon & 1/8 garlic powder.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Pour sauce over chicken & vegetables.  Sprinkle lightly with paprika.\n\nCook for 5 hours on high making sure after 4 1/2 hrs chicken isn\u2019t already done.  If it is, remove meat and cover to keep warm while veggies continue to cook until tender.\n\nSorry about the detail \u2013 teaching teenagers to cook.",

I think there was too much chicken for 4 people and I would use 4 halves instead of 8 next time to make the ratio of chicken to potatoes more even. Instead of the milk (I used condensed) you could use 2 cans of soup for a thicker sauce but I just added 4 Tbsp. of flour to 4 Tbsp. of melted butter and cooked stirring constantly for a minute until bubbly. I added to the sauce for the last hour as well as some salt pepper and sprinkled a layer of nutmeg on the top. It tasted great and was plenty thick enough for me.",
