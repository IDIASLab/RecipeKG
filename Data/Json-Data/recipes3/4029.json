The sauce seemed more like uncooked scrambled eggs to me than a sauce. It tasted fine but I was so unhappy with the texture that I wound up cooking the sauce longer until it became scrambled eggs. I used canola oil instead of butter added a clove of garlic used a bland sliced deli meat and used 1 c plain yogurt 1 c whole milk instead of sour cream. Taste wise mine needs some more seasoning but I'll bet with a flavorful salami no extra seasoning would be needed.",
