I still prefer the traditional way of preparing it with fish (i like chef jhons recipe on this website for Veracuz style fish) but I have to admit this was very delicious. My only changes were to sautee three garlic cloves with the onions and peppers after that I deglaze the pan with some white wine added 1/2 tsp of oregano one cup of cherry tomatoes wich I added at the same time with the chicken along with the olives capers and some of the capers juice (I like a little bit of tanginess in this dish) I simmered this for a few more minutes. I think with this changes it's a little more tasty!! Thanks for sharing your recipe Occasional Cooker!",

I did make one mistake I had a jar of Classico Fire roasted tomato and garlic pasta sauce in my pantry and didn't realize until after I poured it in my veggies that it was a 24 ounce so I had lots more sauce. However my mistake turned out to be raved by my husband and son they both said they liked the extra sauce. I served it over linguine noodles. I did pound my chicken breast nice and thin added some minced garlic and parsley paprika when cooking them for added flavor. I'm sure to make this one again we all gave two thumbs up.",
