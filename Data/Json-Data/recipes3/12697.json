I used regular balsamic and made a \"jam\" out of dried prunes that I had. It was so good and easy once I got the chicken in the pan to cook. I wasn't super adept at using the toothpicks to seal in the filling and some of it leaked out during cooking. We scraped up the sauce and put over the top of the chicken when we ate it. The brie was simply delicious with the prunes. It had seemed that the filling wouldn't be a lot but it turned out to be slightly more than plenty which might be why some of it leaked out. Instead of tenting foil over my pan as chicken baked I put a lid on the pan. There was a fair amount of juice but it cooked down during the last step. Although my version may not have been perfect it sure tasted incredible. I'd highly recommend this dish.",
