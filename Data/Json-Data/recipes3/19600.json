To free up the oven while I cooked the turkey and put the stuffing in the crockpot on high a few hours ahead of time.  I stirred once every hour.  To offset the sweetness that previous reviewers complained of, I only added one cup of apple juice and one cup of chickeb broth which gave it a slightly sweet flavor which really complemented the apples.  Did I mention that this was the first time I ever made homemade stuffing and it was REALLY easy?!!",

People love it! Even my must-eat-meat-or-it's-no-good family! I don't even tell them it's vegetarian! Even though we all eat meat, I still make this stuffing because it is THAT good. \nIf you are looking for vegetarian make sure you read the box on the stuffing you add to see it doesn't have dried chicken broth in it. Or substitute similar herbs or veggie bouillon (must include sage!) and stale bread cut into tiny cubes. But if you are a meat eater, trust me... this recipe is worth trying!!! You'll be convinced.",

                "reviewBody": "We've been making this for years! My mom got this from the Houston Chronicle. Here are a few differences in our recipe my notes are in braces: 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon ginger OR poultry seasoning I like poultry seasoning best 1 cup sliced celery 1/2 pound bulk sausage sauteed (optional) 2 cups chopped apples (about three) 2 cups apple juice OR half apple juice half turkey stock The prep steps are the same. If you use the sausage omit the butter. Saute the sausage then add the vegetables. The dressing can be stuffed lightly into body and neck cavities of turkey. Makes enough for an 18-pound turkey. My hints and preferences are... I make my cornbread into muffins. They bake more quickly. I make them the day before. Day-old is good! My cornbread recipe does not call for much sugar (1/4 cup to 1 cup flour and 1 cup cornmeal). You want a savory cornbread not sweet. I have not used the sausage in years but this recipe is good either way. I have cut the butter down and substituted oil for part of it. 3/4 cup butter is 12 tablespoons! I think 6 tablespoons butter and 4 of vegetable oil work well. I up the poultry seasoning to 1 teaspoon. I have left the eggs out or reduced them but I prefer it with the eggs. If you leave them out make sure you have enough liquid so it won't be dry. I usually use half apple juice half turkey stock (or chicken stock). I have increased pecans to one cup. Enjoy!",
