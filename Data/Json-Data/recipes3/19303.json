Well, yesterday, and especially today, the flavors have melded together, the curry flavor has mellowed, the fruity flavors have brightened, it tastes like a great amercian chicken salad for a picnic lunch, but about 20 times better. WOW. TRY THIS RECIPE! But, don't judge until it's had a chance to sit in the fridge for at least 1 day. ..... p.s. I used about 4 Tbs. Miracle Whip Light (25 cals/Tbs) and I don't think it could have tasted better with full fat mayo. To keep the cals to a minimum, remember that 1/2 cup of nuts packs a big calorie punch, so chop them small and reduce the amount to 1/4 or 1/3 cup. And use nuts that are especially healthy, such as walnuts (excellent source of Omega-3 fats), if you want those extra calories to really count for something, nutritionally.",

This version is perfect (as long as you like curry)!!  Boiling chicken to perfection is hard to do so here's my 5 cents worth:  Cut up your raw chicken in chunks and bring to a boil in chicken broth.  Boil for just a couple of minutes and then put a lid on, take off the stove and just let it sit for 15 minutes or so.  It cooks slowly like this and results in a perfect texture and flavor.",

The tasted of curry in this really makes this salad and you definitely need to make sure to let the flavors \"marinate\" for a few hours before serving as the taste is much better then.  I have eaten this stuffed into a pita pocket and also rolled into a wheat tortilla wrap with a green salad on the side for lunch.",

I used a Granny Smith Apple and red seedless grapes vs. green. I also  used dried cranberries vs. raisins. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used 1/2 cup of Hellman's light mayo cut with 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream along with the curry and a bit of salt and pepper. It chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good. Overall, a great combination of flavors! Especially good on whole grain bread!",
