I took the base ingredients and tweaked the steps to make a better dish.\n\n- Marinate Chicken in 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar and 1 T low sodium soy sauce, salt, pepper. Grill, pan fry, or bake - however you prefer your chicken. \n- Make a sweet potato mash with salt and pepper, and 1 t of brown sugar. \n- Make a balsamic reduction of 1/2 cup vinegar (or more if you want to batch). I like to add 1 T of butter and 1 t of brown sugar to my reduction. \n- Lay your cooked chicken on top of the sweet potato mash, and lightly drizzle with your reduction. Tasty!",

It is especially wonderful cold the next day and cut up into a salad. As for this recipe baking chicken breasts at 400 covered for 40 minutes is way too much time. The breasts will stew or be rubbery sometimes both. Easier to pan fry covered about ten minutes on each side with a medium to low flame.",
