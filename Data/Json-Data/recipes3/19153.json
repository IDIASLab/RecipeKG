I also heated up the condensed milk and coconut cream slightly so the sauce would be thinner while pouring over the cake. Poked holes using a wooden spoon handle ... the sauce absorbed right in. The cake came out light and fluffy, not soggy like I thought it would. Fabulous taste ... hubby ate 2 big pieces as soon as I finished sprinkling the coconut! Thanks for the recipe - this will definitely become a family favorite!",

But I was intrigued that the recipe recieved such high reviews and so many; so I assumed it had a cult following and I was quickly seduced -- finding myself in my local grocery store searching for the  ridiculous ingredients.\r\nI made the cake and yes I have to admit again-- it is delicious and very light.   It is much much better than I would have thought and it does not have that coconut tanning product taste that I find offensive.  In any event, the cake, while perverse in its cult status (you should see how weird it looks in my icebox), is a winner.   I altered the recipe slightly by pouring a snifter of armagnac over the top before icing it.  I also used Betty Crocker yellow cake mix rather than white.
