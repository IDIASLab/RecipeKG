I served it with warm crusty bread and garlic, parmesean, buttered noodles, then we made mashed potatoes to go with it the next night. You can eat it just as a soup too. The only change I made was coating the beef in flour and searing it before adding it. This thickened it up a bit and made the beef more tender. I chose to omit the peas because I don't like them, so I only simmered it for 45 minutes, but I had also cut the recipe in half. I will definately make this as a cold winter night comfort food dish again! Thank you for sharing your recipe.",
