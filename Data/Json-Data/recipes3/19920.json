I like the fact that I can throw this together with what I might have on hand, and have a good comfort food meal.  French bread and salad were all I added to round out our dinner!!  Thanks!",

Doing this in a slow cooker it probably needs stirred at least once midway through cooking time as the potatoes on the bottom were a little mushy and the ones on the top were less cooked. But very nice blend of flavors -- would probably like better with a little more sauce as well. Will have to try the oven method next time too.",

It's been a year since I first made this and it has become a regular meal in my house. We have it at leat once a month. We all love it and it comes out perfect everytime. Very eay prep. A long cooking time, but hey, it gives me time to do other things since it is basically set it and forget it.\n\nYou really can't mess this up and it is soooo tasty. Makes it's own gravy too.\n\nThe only thing I might suggest since I do it in the oven id to take the foil of for the last 15 or 20 minutes to let the top brown. \n\nIt is a little too much food for my small family but I still make the full recipe, in fact I might even increase it a bit, but it freezes well, so I don't mind.",

I also mixed the mushroom and vegetable beef soups together in a small bowl before adding them on top. It did taste good when it was done but a little on the dry thick side. I'm thinking maybe something like a cup of beef broth might have helped sauce it up a bit. The French onion soup that other reviewers suggested in place of the veggie soup might have done the trick too because it's a more liquidy soup to begin with. I also think it could have used some spices to jazz it up maybe some black pepper or garlic or onion powder. If you make this in a slow cooker I would recommend keeping the cooking time closer to the low end (6 hours) rather than the high end (8 hours). I went right down the middle with 7 hours and if I would have cooked it that extra hour it would have ended up way too dry.",
