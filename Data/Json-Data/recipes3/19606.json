Didn't add the jalapenos on top but put lots of black pepper inside. We also used half the broth and liked that consistency - I can't say if more broth would have been too much. With half these were kind of the consistency of a creamy bean and cheese burrito. I wish we had more leftovers to make these again!",

I did not have high hopes for this so I started out by halving the recipe which calls for 4 cups of broth. I started out with 1 cup left all of the other ingredients the same and these turned out fantastic. As written you will have issues. You must reduce the amount of broth. With the reduction of broth this is a 5 star way to use up leftovers. It's not the prettiest of dishes but the flavor combo with the addition of pickled jalapeno impressed me. I did end up dicing some of the jalapeno and adding it to the mixture along with adding slices to the top out of personal preference. If you do end up needing to thicken the mixture I recommend doing so with instant mashed potato flakes instead of flour. I would I would gladly eat these over a bean and cheese burrito any day. They were that good. Don't skip the tortilla browning step for it adds another layer of flavor that comes through in the finished dish. Thanks for sharing!",
