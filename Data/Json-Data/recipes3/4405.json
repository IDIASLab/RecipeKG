My husband calls it the classiest meal I serve because it's exactly like what you order in a fancy restaurant!  Very low in fat and calories, and it only takes 1/2 hour from start to finish.  Pairs nicely with roasted baby potatoes and steamed broccoli.",

I would also recommend putting the tomatoes in warm water to let them soften, like others have said  It truly makes a difference and ADD MORE!  Next time I will cut the chicken into bite size pieces, so they can truly absorb the sauce.  Thanks!",
