I've just been diagnosed with celiac disease and I'm so glad I found these noodles. The only suggestion I have is to add a touch of oil to the boiling water and to stir immediately or the noodles will stick together forming an uncooked clump. I learned that the hard way getting busy in the kitchen. We will be having this again.",

I did not have gluten free bread so I soaked and drained some oats I blended in the food processor. This worked like a charm. I did end up adding additional garlic and other seasonings as well. If you like lots of flavor you may want to as well!:) Add grated parmesan to the noodles for an extra kick of flavor!",

My kids and their father have been raised on this recipe and never tire of it. I had doubts about using soaked gluten free bread but it worked. I used the heel of the loaf and let it sit a couple of hours to dry up a bit. It didn't turn immediately to mush and really helped bind the meat lending a moist texture once cooked. I used Barilla GF Tortiglioni instead of their spaghetti and it held up to all the handling and made it to the plate like regular pasta. Definitely a keeper for those of us who must eat gluten free and even a very good meal for those who don't eat GF.",
