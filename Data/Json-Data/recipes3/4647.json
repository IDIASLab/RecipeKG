That is the way I usually make it these days.",

I will be making a lot of this and putting it in my freezer for a quick snack for unexpected guests. I bought 10 pounds of hamburger to make some so I would have it for New Year's Eve. I think I will add jalepenos to one batch. Thanks again for this easy recipe.",
