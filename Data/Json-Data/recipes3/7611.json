My fiance loved it! There are things I changed just to suit my tastes...(I am sure the original recipe would have been just as good.) I added onto the normal salt and pepper...Old Bay, garlic salt, more paprika, a little ground red pepper, onion powder and then I dusted it with flour.  What helped me know that the pan was hot enough was something I learned from the Food Network.  I just took a tiny pinch of flour and tossed it in the oil...if it started to cook or bubble...that's how you know it's ready for the fish.  I did not use the extra unsalted butter.  THIS WAS AWESOME! My fiance ate the whole thing before I could sit down! He said it was better than his mom's! :) He even told his mom about it!  Thank you so much for this dish!",

I added the spices (garlic salt, pepper, crushed oregano) to the flour before I coated the fish as well, which reduced the spices I had to add directly to the fish. Also, instead of brushing the melted butter on top of the fish during cooking, I added about half a tablespoon to the olive oil, and then heated the two together before adding the fish, so the fish seared in the oil and butter. My fish did not need 4 minutes per side either, they were perfect at about 3 minutes a side. So yummy, cannot wait to make this again!",
