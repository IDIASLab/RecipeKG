I guess it didn't matter that it overflowed though. I'm wondering if I could use sour cream or plain yogurt instead of milk for a more stroganoff-like taste. Mushrooms would be a tasty addition too. I'll try that the next time I find zucchini (it isn't easy to come by in Taiwan where I live).",

                "reviewBody": "I had bought a ginormous (is that even a word?) zucchini at the 99 cent store and wanted a stuffed zucchini recipe that could be used as a main dish. This recipe suited my needs perfectly and we all loved it. I added an equal amount of panko crumbs to the Parmesan cheese on top to give it a little crunch. Since the zucchini was so large I doubled the filling ingredients but it turned out I shouldn't have done that. No worries though. I just put the extra filling in a casserole dish topped it with the Parmesan/panko mixture and baked it along with the zucchini. The topping didn't brown very well in the oven even after almost 30 minutes of baking so I put it under the broiler for a couple minutes to finish it off. This will definitely be repeated but I think I'll peel the zucchini dice it all up into the filling and bake it as a casserole instead.",

I chose the recipe because it does not call for tomato sauce which gives him heart burn. I made some minor changes. I doubled the nutmeg and the garlic. Then since the sauce was very pasty I added an extra half cup of milk--much creamier. My husband does not like the taste of parmessan cheese so I used mild cheddar but mixed it in to the whole concoction before piling into the shells. Then since I used BIG squash ( one that had gotten away from me in the garden) I had to toss most of the pulp because the seeds would have been tough. So I took some nice small yellow squash sliced it then and cooked it until just tender in the meat after the meat was all browned. I also had some mushrooms I wanted to use up--maybe about 3/4 cup--so I tossed them into the meat mixture. Then I piled the whole mess into the shells sprinkled a wee bit more cheddar on top and baked it for 30 minutes. The combination of boiling and baking made even the skin on the large zucchini tender enough to be edible. It was really good. I think a person could use the base recipe and experiment with lots of different flavors. I actually forgot to put the paprika in but it was still awesome.",
