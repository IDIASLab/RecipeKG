I also cut the amount of peas, carrots and chicken in half and still made 2 Pies that were filled to the top, I used my grandma's Pyrex Pies dishes so that may be the reason it seemed I had so much.\nI added a little over 1/2 cup of Ora Ida  steamer potatoes to the bottom of the pie before the cooked ingredients because I love potatoes.\nMy family loved it and we all had seconds.  \nThere's no doubt l will make this for many years to come.\nThanks again for sharing.",
