We did have to make some changes based on being in land-locked Tennessee though. All I had was chicken stock unfortunately so I had to use that and the crab legs at the store were a bit dismal so I left those out. The great thing about this is its versatility though because it came out great (I plan on making my own stock hopefully next time.) This was my first time working with any kind of clam/mussel/etc so I was a bit nervous but everything cooked up wonderfully. Also I'm not one for spice but the red pepper flakes gave it a lovely depth that's needed with this dish. Served it with some crusty bread to soak up the yumminess!! Thanks for a great recipe!",
