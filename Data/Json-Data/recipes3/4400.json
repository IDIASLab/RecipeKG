After tossing I put on a cooling rack placed in a jellyroll pan lined with foil. I didn't have any trouble with too much flour as other reviewers did -- probably because I tossed with oil first. Next time I might try adding some melted butter when tossing with the oil for a yummier though unhealthier version!",
