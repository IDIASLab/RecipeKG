And there was no measurement for a seasoning sauce - didn't know what it was, so didn't use that either. \nI did substitute some of the broth with left over roast beef gravy for better flavour. Plus I just didn't want to waste anything.\n\nFrom that point I just put everything in the crockpot except for potatoes - it's quite hearty enough without them - and cooked on low for about 8 hours. \n\nMakes a ton of soup which suits me well as I try to have as many meals in the freezer as possible to suit my busy life. \n\nJust as a postscript - I think the importance of saut\u00e9ing vegetables for any soup is sometimes under-rated. It's a step that imparts so much flavour, and really doesn't take that much time.",
