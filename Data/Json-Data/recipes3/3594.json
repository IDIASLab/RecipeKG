I was surprised at how tasty it was considering the small amount of ingredients involved.  I did have to add more butter to the pan after sauteing the meat, and the flour was a little lumpy.  But I whisked almost non-stop until it blended together.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper for a little more flavor.  This dish is rich, so I would plan the rest of your meal accordingly.",
