I used La Victoria Roasted Pepper Salsa and instead of measuring, I just spooned the amount of salsa I felt was appropriate for him. Otherwise, I felt the amount of ingredients were spot on to yield the burritos. I don't think it's possible to write how to wrap a burrito any better than the recipe author did. It does get easier after wrapping the first one, following the written directions.  Overall, my husband says this is a perfect and delicious recipe as written, but also easy to adjust if you'd like to use a different meat in the burritos (e.g. sausage, ham, etc.). Excellent and I'll be making these or another variant of them in the future for him. Thanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Update 2/7/2019: Okay DO NOT try to reheat these from frozen. I managed to make it work by heating it for 3 minutes 1 minute at a time and turning it after each minute was up. This got the insides fully warmed but made the tortilla overcooked and chewy. Much better to remove individual burrito from freezer put in fridge then reheat for a minute or two. The texture also isn't what I wanted too heavy on the potatoes (using my 1.75 oz egg and potato) I would bump the egg to 2 or 3 oz and just make a lot more eggs than the recipe calls for then 1 or.50 oz of potato. Needs some tweaking basically. Might be a personal preference I like lots of eggs in my burritos however my husband prefers the potato so I'll be keeping the ratio as is for him. ORIGINAL: Overall a really great recipe! Only thing I would change is to season the eggs after they are cooked instead of before seasoning them prior to being cooked makes the end result watery. I also whisked them for a long time to make them airy and did the chef method of constantly and briskly stirring with a spatula until they start forming keeping them as smooth as possible but this takes a lot of effort which I only do because my husband is picky about eggs. I also used heavy cream instead of milk it is high in fat but I had some sitting around that needed to be used up and it is delicious in eggs. Sour cream is actually a better alternative to milk but milk is still more commonly used and in more fridges than sour cream",
