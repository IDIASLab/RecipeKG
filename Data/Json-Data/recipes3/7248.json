I thought the snap peas ended up overcooked using the cook times in this recipe although I will admit I like very crisp veggies. In the future I will immediately add the sugar and vinegar right when I add the snap peas. It was distressing to me to watch the peas loose their beautiful bright green color as the vinegar was reducing. Also I thought it was slightly sweet and would probably only use half as much sugar in the future. I did buy Sugar in the Raw but I'm not sure why you couldn't use regular sugar or even honey. Of course since I had to buy a box of 100 packets of Sugar in the Raw I can make this recipe another 33 times before I have to worry about what kind of sweetener to use... Thanks for the recipe!",
