I threw everything into my food processor expect for the feta as I wanted to be able to see the cheese crumbles throughout the spread. Also, I suggest piercing the eggplants before baking them. I didn't and all of a sudden I heard a \"BOOM\"! When I opened the oven, one of the eggplants had exploded! I'm assuming the moisture is what made it pop. Kind of like popcorn I suppose. Pretty funny; saved me from having to cut it open I guess. Made pita chips to serve with this different and delicious dip. Thanks so much!",

I only used 2 to test but from now on I will use the full 4 cloves. I added lemon zest and lemon juice to add an extra depth of flavor. I also added Cavender's Greek Seasoning for a bit of zip. I did not peel my eggplant because they were so young and tender. And finally I used a fresh organic cracked pepper and sea salt goat cheese. Everyone LOVED this appetizer and with these modifications I will be sure to make it again.",
