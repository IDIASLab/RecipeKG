I used 2 9-inch rounds for this cake.  I did find the frosting for this cake to be a bit \"strange\".  It's mainly just cream cheese, and as a result, the honey \"separated out\" once I had iced the cake.  By the second day, the cake was looking stranger and stranger (a brown, streaky appearance and the icing had split along the line where the two cake layers come together)...but it sure did taste good!  If anyone has some tips to prevent this, please post!",

I've made it twice and I liked it both times a little better the second time when I increased the carrots to 3 cups and the pecans to 1 1/2 cups. It was moister and very dense. If you don't like a dense cake leave the amounts the same as the original recipe. The moisture was there both times I made it. The cream cheese frosting is to die for and to decorate the cake I crushed a Nonni's Gingerbread Macadamia nut biscotti and sprinkled it on top. It is a limited time release biscotti that I bought at Sam's Club and had on hand available for this Fall time of year. It added a nice pretty golden dusting to the top of the cake and although the flavor came through a little it didn't overpower the flavor of the cake. Top Notch recipe!",

Then I served it to some of the most demanding dinner guests imaginable: fellow churchmen eating a pot-luck meal. After one hour it was three-fourths gone. All who tried it loved it and at least fifteen people asked for the recipe. Honey is a flavor enhancer. Refined sugar dominates any mix it goes into so that what you taste is flavored sugar. But honey does not suppress and dominate other flavors; it brings them out. So you can actually taste the carrots the pineapple the spices and the walnuts with a bare hint of extra sweetness. And best of all it produces no \"sugar high\" and \"sugar crash \" nor does it make you drowsy after you eat it nor suppress your immune system as refined sugar tends to do.",
