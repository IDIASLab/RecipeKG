I did follow the directions except adding a few more spices such as paprika onion flakes and cayenne to kick it up a notch. I used my food dehydrator to cook the tofu but it ended up not chewy as expected but just with an unpleasant texture. And this was after only 5 hours in there. It was also way too salty for my and my husbands tastes. I will not make this again.",
