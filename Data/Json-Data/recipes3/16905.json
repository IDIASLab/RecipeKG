                "reviewBody": "Very rich. Since we don't have access to really good salmon without paying an arm & leg for it we tried the \"poor mans\" alternative. We smoked our own cheaper salmon & used 5 oz of Morrey's smoked salmon. We couldn't find creme fraiche so looked up a substitute which I decided wasn't going to happen either by letting heavy cream and yogurt sit out for 6 hrs. (some instructions even said to put through a cheese cloth). Instead as a last minute idea I used a cup of heavy cream 1T milk & a squirt of lemon. Since a yogurt subsitute can be milk & lemon/or vinegar I went with that. Wow it came out delicious. Next time we'll use less salmon & smoke ourselves & try using only a cup of gruyere cheese because I thought it was to heavy in cheese taste. Probably will make once a year cause it is sooooo rich tasting & don't need tummy problems. Definite leftovers when only for 2 people.",
