So I tried them without the oil, and seasoned them when they were cooked and they were the best Ive had them. \n\nApparently the oil keeps them moist longer and the salt holds the moisture inside them pea.\n\nThis works great for any legume, peas, beans of any description - my nieces and nephews eat them by the bucket load and they HATE peas and beans any other way.\n\nA great snack for body builders or just anyone watching their weight - especially when dry roasted as it cuts out ALL the oil!",

I tried a similar Martha Stewart recipe that called for baking at 300 degrees, but the chickpeas never dried out, even after being in the over for twice the recommended time. I decided to see if there was a similar recipe on Allrecipes.com, and I was so pleased there was. Once I raised the temperature to 450 for about 10 minutes, the chickpeas finally dried out, shrunk, and got crunchy, as they are supposed to do. As another reviewer stated, they do taste a little like corn nuts - a tasty snack but with a lot more protein. Next, I decided to try kidney beans, and they were good too, but some burned at 40 minutes. These I'll have to remove about 5-10 minutes sooner. These beans also split open at this temperature, but it does not affect the pverall taste. I plan on carrying these around in my purse from now on instead of pretzels for future snack attacks.",

They're way better if you add the oil halfway through, or else they don't get crispy and crunchy. They're so healthy and tasty this way!",
