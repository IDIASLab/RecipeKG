I took into consideration all the reviewers' suggestions and it came out wonderfully.  \n\nI added an extra cup of cubed chicken and an extra cup of rice.  I used about 2 cups of fresh steamed broccoli and 1 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms.  I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of chicken soup. I left out the water chestnuts and the celery because they just don't do it for me in a casserole. I sauteed the onion and mushrooms then added all the other ingredients, adding shredded Colby cheese only after it was in the baking dish and ready to be baked. \n\nAgain, I'm very pleased with how this turned out.  My only wish is that I had something crunchy to top it off at the end.  Maybe French fried onions?",
