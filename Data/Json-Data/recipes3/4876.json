I took the advice of some previous reviews and made a few changes...three cloves of garlic, 2 carrots, 2 cans of chicken broth, 2 cans of white beans, 1 box of frozen chopped spinach, no summer savory. Didn't want to buy summer savory for only this recipe so skipped it.  Not sure what I might be missing with skipping that - oh well. I cut up two Roma tomatoes and that wasn't quite enough. Will do 4 next time.  Used had blender to thicken right in the pot so could skip the cooling off step - LOVE the hand blender!! Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the great recipe! And a wonderful web site :)",

I made the following adjustments: I added 2 chopped red potatoes as well as a can of chopped spinach, as suggested by previous reviewers.  I also added a few shallots to the onion and garlic mixture.  Additionally, I substituted veggie broth (I am a vegetarian).  My husband and I found the flavor and consistency to be excellent.  He asked me specifically to add this to my 'rotation.'  Plus- it's great for those of us with the infamous \"I will lose weight\" New Year's resolution.  Try it with a crusty multigrain bread- DELICIOUS!",

I also added an additional can of beans. ( for additional bean taste) and added kale ( just because I had some) instead of savory. and I dropped the corn. This made an excellent soup. I used a hand blender to blend some of the beans and it came out just the right consistency. This is definitely a top drawer add on to any meal. Very easy to make and very healthy eating. I highly recommend.",

I made a bunch of small modifications: - threw in a good handful of fresh thyme (3 whole sprigs and the leaves off of about another 4-5 springs) - used fresh parsley - used a can of white beans and a can of white kidney beans. I left a little of the juice in the kidney bean can and all the juice in the white bean can - added a can of hominy (no juice) - cut down on the chicken broth to 2 cans (4 cups) since I had the bean juice - used 8 large grape/very small roma tomatoes - added juice from 1/2 lemon at the end It was so flavorful had lots of healthy veggies and just the right amount of broth! Perfect for a cold evening. Will definitely make again!",
