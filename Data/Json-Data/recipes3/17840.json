I personally cooked the chicken pieces in onion and garlic. I poured the chicken/onion/garlic into two cans of condensed cream of chicken soups and 1/2 C white wine.I added shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream. I then added cheese on top and mixed the cracker crumbs with butter and put them on top of the cheese. My daughter loved it. Very, very flavorful meal!!!  Thanks!!!!",

My aunt was the first to make this for christmas maybe 8 years ago and since no one had a name for it it became Val's (my aunts name) chicken. I actually made this 2 days ago to bring as a dish to work and everyone loved it there as well! What I do to my dish is buy chicken breast on the bone clean it take off the skin sprinkle sea salt on the breasts and let it sit for 10 minutes. While they are sitting I boil water on the stove and cook the breasts for an hour. I also usually use 2 large breasts and double the soup and sour cream (2 cans cream of mushroom 16 oz. container of sour cream). I cant say I've used ritz crackers before I always use the blue bag of Pepperidge farm stuffing (2 cups) with 1/2 stick of melted butter. By doubling the soup and sour cream you can go up to 4 breasts if you dont like alot of sauce or stick to 2 large breasts if you want extra sauce (which is good to serve with a side of egg noodles). My other aunt who also makes this recipe uses 2 chicken breasts and 2 chicken thighs because she finds the chicken breast only is too dry.",

I melt a large package of cream cheese in the microwave and mix it with a can of cream of chicken soup. I shred the chicken and put it in the dish first then I put the cream cheese/soup mixture on top. Then I crunch up Club crackers and drizzle melted butter on top. You can make this lower fat by using non-fat or lowfat cream cheese & soup and reduced fat crackers. It still tastes really good. I've not found a way around using the butter and still get the same flavor (I love the taste of butter) but this at least helps with the fat content. I also sprinkle a little garlic powder into it. My kids and all of their friends who have had it love it!! Very kid-friendly dish!",
