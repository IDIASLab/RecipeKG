Being able to make individual servings made it easy to serve and gave it a classy touch. I did add 1 lb medimum shrimp grated parmesan and used shallots instead of onion because they have a tamer flavor. Seasoned the sauce with 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning which does a fantastic job of enhancing the flavors of the seafood. Most everyone loved it though it is a bit expensive to make for a very large gathering.",

I did make a lot of extra sauce so it covered the fish in the ramikins and then completely covered them in crab and cheese. The ramikins are great for a dinner party because each person gets an individual serving a nice touch. I made this early in the day then put them in the fridge. Then before dinner put on the cheese and browned while everyone had cocktails. Very little work during the actual party. A couple people thought the overall taste was a little like lobster. I am going to try next with monkfish. Great recipe!",

I cut the recipe in half & cooked it in two large ramekins figuring since we weren't having an appetizer w/ it that we would want bigger portions. Not so. Smaller portions would have been perfect although next time I do think that I will serve a pureed vegetable soup as a first course. I used tilapia instead of halibut shallots instead of onions added a can of tiny shrimp (rinsed & drained) & used a jack/colby blend of cheese. Served it w/ pinot grigio (it's what I used w/ the tilapia too) Lemon Butter Snow Peas & a mixed greens salad w/ Lemon Chiffon Pudding for dessert. Thansk for the recipe Carolyn!",

I also use portabella mushrooms instead of button and I used the whole can of milk with just a tab more flour. I had to use imitation crab which was just what was available at the time:( I also subbed grouper instead of halibut. overall I think it was great I still feel like the first step is missing something maybe I will add garlic to wine to give the seafood just a little more flavor.

However once baked w/the fish(used flounder) & crab it was fantastic! I do think the green onions helped too! Excellent! I do feel that this is more of an accompaniment to main dish tho. Maybe a small steak? Idk it just didn't feel like a main dish to me. I served it w/crusty bread asparagus & a baked potato. The potato just didn't go.",
