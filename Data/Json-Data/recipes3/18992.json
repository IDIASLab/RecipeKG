So I mixed Szechuan Spice Sauce (hot peppers, onions, ginger and garlic), honey and a few drops of 'Liquid Smoke' together.  It didn't come out any where near spicy as I thought, though the chicken was excellently tender and moist. Still give it a 5, though next time I'll probably either use fresh jalapenos or  another fresh pepper.",
