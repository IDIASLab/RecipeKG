Used 1/2 butter & 1/2 olive oil for frying then used brandy/milk to deglaze the pan prior to pouring over chix. sprinkled Parm on top. Baked 45 mins @ 350. Tender moist chix wonderful taste & texture: whisked a little milk into the gravy to stretch over Egg Noodles. Definitely NOT for those who like hot spice/kick... but for those of us who like good old filling comfort food it's an absolute winner!!! But adding your favorite \"heat\" to kick it up would be E-Z! Might add a touch of dill weed next time... (and there WILL be a next time!!)",

I used MelCole's idea and did the butter/Olive oil instead and deglazed the pan w/the sauce as well. I was short about 1/2 cup of milk so I tossed in about 2-3 tablespoons of sour cream while deglazing the pan and it added such a nice flavor. Other thing that changed in mid-prep was I only had bonless chicken tenders not breasts they were still wonderful! But I reduced the cook time from 60mins to about 45 and it was perfect. Didn't have noodles but side of Mac&Cheese went awesome. Definately doing this one again and again and again!",

I cooked the medallions for half the time (30 minutes) and they came out perfect: moist and tender.
