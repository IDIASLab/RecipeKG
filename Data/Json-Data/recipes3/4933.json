I cut the fat by a huge amount and used four egg whites instead of two whole eggs (1 egg has approximately 5g of fat, vs 1 egg white which has only about 0.2g fat).  I used frozen spinach which I cooked before adding to the egg mixture.  I used fresh chopped onions instead of onion powder, because I had them on hand so why not?  This is a very good basis for a spinach omelet, and you can easily tweak it to your own liking.  A great way to incorporate veggies into your diet.",

                "reviewBody": "Spinach omelets are one of my favorites and something I make for myself often, slightly varying what I put in them each time. On this occasion I sauteed chopped onion in butter, added the spinach and cooked just till wilted, added the eggs, cooked them until almost set,  then topped with the Parmesan (just a sprinkle), some  shredded Provolone and chopped tomatoes before folding the omelet over. Mushrooms also would be a great addition.  I'm familiar with the combination of nutmeg and spinach which is used often in Italian cooking, but I don't care for it so chose not to use it. (Even so, the amount called for seems like nutmeg overkill - it's flavor should be VERY subtle)  I omitted the onion powder as well.  I would suggest not using the full amount of Parmesan, at least to start, as 1-1/2 T. seems like an awful lot for just two eggs.  Similarly for the onion powder, which I wouldn't use at all, let alone 1/4 teaspoon.  Good start to a great spinach omelet with some modifications.",
