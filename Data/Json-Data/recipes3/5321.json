Definitely follow the \"Fast Chicken Soup Base\" recipe and use that, makes it so much more flavorful than plain old canned broth.  In addition to parsley I use thyme, and depending on what's in my pantry/fridge I replace the white rice with wild rice or fine egg noodles, add parsnips and celery, eliminate the peas (not a fan).  And I simmer it much longer than the 10-20 minutes recommended, more like 2 hours.  Serve with a salad and nice crusty bread or rolls, and you have yourself a super meal!!!!",

I used the chicken broth after I boiled the chicken and then strained it and added 3 more cans of canned chicken broth. Make sure you use dried thyme leaves and not ground thyme like I did. I have thyme growing in my flowerbeds I should have added that instead (oh well). I also added a little tarragon. My boyfriend liked it. I liked it to although we'll be eating chicken soup for days.",
