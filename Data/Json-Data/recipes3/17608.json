My gut was telling me to get some of the moisture out of the shredded potatoes but the recipe did not specify this. I would either wring the potatoes in a towel or put into a salad spinner to reduce the liquid released after shredding. It took an extra 20 minutes to bake off the liquid in the dish. BUT these potatoes were delicious! And if you have a food processor to shred the potatoes and onions this recipe is soooooo easy. Obviously texture was different than scalloped potatoes but the taste was similar. Definitely making this one again. Serene thanks for sharing your recipe.",

Made it as written and served with sour cream on the side because it reminded me so much of potatoe pancakes, just so much easier to make.\nTwo things to be aware of..may take longer to cook than specified and it really stuck to the pan and quite a bit was wasted.  Next time I will try oiling my cassarole dish first, but there will be a next time and a next time... Family loved it as well.",
