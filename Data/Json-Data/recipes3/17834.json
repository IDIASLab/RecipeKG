Nice smoky flavor, however I wasn't a big fan of the bacon's texture once soaking in the soup.   I suggest using less broth.  I used 6 cups instead of the 8 called for (2 quarts) and that was more than enough. There seems to be unnecessary parts to step 2. Just add the tomatoes in with the cabbage and let simmer together, instead of adding them separately.",
