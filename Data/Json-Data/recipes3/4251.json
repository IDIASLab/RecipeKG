I used 1 tablespoon of Italian Seasoning and 1 tablespoon of Oregano in place of all the other seasonings (too much spice otherwise). To give it more of a \"rich\" flavor I added one cup of red wine (Merlot Cab whatever you got). This removes a lot of the tomato-y (sp?) taste and gives the sauce a deep rich flavor and taste. The end result is a sauce that will go well on any pasta. No disrespect to the writer I just put my.02 in the recipe.",
