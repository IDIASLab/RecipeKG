Next time I make it (and I will make it again)I will:\r\n\r\n(1) Saut\u00e9 the garlic. I am a huge garlic fan but the fresh garlic taste in this recipe was overpowering and did not mix well with the other ingredients. I think the flavor would be better if it were saut\u00e9ed for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n(2) Add a few more vegetables...perhaps mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes. You could even saut\u00e9 the mushrooms and the garlic together.\r\n\r\n(3) Add some freshly grated parmesan cheese. The goat cheese was good but I think the added tang of some parmesan would be delicious.\r\n\r\nI re-heated this recipe the next day and it did not work well. It still tasted good, but it was not the same. This is not necessarily a bad thing though! A recipe like this, full of fresh ingredients, shouldn't be saved for leftovers.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a very tasty dish...thanks!\r\n",

When I served it up...I thought it needed something and I sprinkled on about 1/2 cup of Parmesan and a bit of leftover Mozerella.  This was half way through the meal and everyone liked it better with the additional cheeses!  I added them to my recipe card.  I love the ease and I will make it my way again and again!  YUM!",

I added baby spinach to the arugula for a total of 4 cups which I added to the onions to \"wilt.\" I felt like I didn't have enough greens after that and added a little more spinach and about 2 more cups arugula to the pasta. My package of goat cheese was 4 oz so I was a little short on goat cheese - but I don't think it made a big difference. I did add maybe 1/2 cup shredded parmesan. And I used grape tomatoes. Will enjoy this for work dinners for the rest of the week! Yum! (Oh! I did not bother to chopped the greens... )",
