I think this would be great with some shredded cheddar added but I'll expierement with that next time (not that it needs anything else because it's wonderful as is). I used 'Sweet Baby Ray's Original' bbq sauce. This is a definate keeper and one that I will make often YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I made half the recipe since this recipe is a big batch. For the paprika I used a little smoked and sweet paprika along with adding in some italian seasonings parsley and chopped celery. It was pretty good but I still think it needs an extra little something to it. I could barely taste the bbq sauce in it. So next time I may add a little more along with some chopped bell pepper. I also think some bacon and maybe some shredded cheddar cheese would be good in it as well. Thanks for the great recipe! I will make again for sure!",
