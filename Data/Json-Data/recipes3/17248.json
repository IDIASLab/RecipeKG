If you're looking for a fun, and very seasonably appropriate way to cook some pork shoulder, I can't think of a better, or more beautiful one, which is why I really hope you give this a try soon. Season the pork any way you want. I plated mine up with buttery mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts.",

Since I had pork and an extra pumpkin on hand I gave it a try. The seasonings and braising liquid were from the stew recipe. After browning the pork I stuffed as much pork as would fit into the pumpkin and added the stew sauce and some extra apple cider for the braising liquid then cooked as directed. It turned out just like the video and was a great way to show off to the in-laws! In my opinion the pumpkin was the best part as it did take on the delicious flavor from the pork. Great recipe Chef John!",
