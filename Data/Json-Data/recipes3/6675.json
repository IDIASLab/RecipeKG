I did modify it a bit by adding 1 granny smith apple chopped and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. Also I only had chicken stock so i used that instead of broth. I used the mixture to stuff a chicken. Well it came out phenomenal! Kid hubby and some friends absolutely loved the stuffing. The apples n cranberries gave it a nice kick. Will do again.",
