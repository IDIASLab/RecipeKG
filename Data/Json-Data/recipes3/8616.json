It was tasty but I would have liked more filling. There was an awful lot of pasta but IMO it was light on the mushroom filling. From a presentation point of view it was pretty flat unlike a traditional lasagna. And two Tbsp of flour will not thicken 4 cups of milk took more like 5. Thanks for sharing Gina.",

I used jarred roasted red peppers instead of dicing fresh to add a layer of colour. I also added white pepper to the bechamel. Jessica I think it's essential that you incorporate the milk slowly and whisk continuously. Also I cooked it for 45 minutes with just the white sauce on top then removed the foil added the cheese and cooked another 10 minutes then broiled for a few to brown the top. It was good and I will make it again but might add some spinach or shaved Brussels sprouts. Great concept just needs a little tweaking!!",

I find it makes the flavors richer. I added some chopped shallots and green onions also chopped less garlic since it is in the jarred sauce we had. I also used 2% skim mozzarella and normal ricotta as described here though I have successfully substituted even the smooth low fat cottage cheese as a way to have a lower-fat ingredient before and both were very successful! I would add more of the mushrooms as they cook down quickly and perhaps as done before other vegetables including the red and green peppers perhaps squash cut thinly and well-drained spinach as the many-layers idea is great but still they did not fill up the pan as described. One way I do lasagna differently was shared by a great cook her mom used which is to pour a little cream or half and half cow milk though now I use coconut and almond milks along the edges of the pan before cooking it rather than making an often recommended cooked version of this. The flavor was incredibly good and I will use this recipe again. It makes a lot of servings!",
