I'd never bought chicken stock before but I managed to find some at my store. I bought some medium-size (51-60 count) shrimp since the recipe didn't specify a size and I thought they might be too big for this recipe but I thought they worked nicely. Also I wasn't sure if I should have left the tails on (some shrimp recipes do some don't and I don't know what the \"rules\" are) so I took the tails off. However I thought the brandy overpowered the other flavors quite a bit. Maybe a higher-quality brandy than what I had on hand would've tasted better or maybe I should just have reduced the quantity. In the end though this was the first recipe I've added to my recipe box in quite a while. I just may try it again this time with crab/lobster (and sherry) as the recipe description suggests. Thanks for a great recipe!",
