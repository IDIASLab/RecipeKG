I did not make the cheese sauce (too much work so early in the morning) or use shrimp - but followed the recipe - adding only some fresh chive to the eggs - and it was rich and lovely. I had some crab that my husband brought home from Alaska and we were saving for a special occasion. It is always a risk making something for the first time when using expensive ingredients. All I can say that the crab was not wasted on this dish - it was perfect for showing off the decadent nature of the seafood. It was lavish and heavenly. Many thanks for a great recipe!!!!!!!!!",

Also sprinkled some sliced green onion over the top. What a delicious and decadent Christmas Day breakkie. Thanks Jennyw!!",

I doubled the recipe to serve several of us. I also had fresh crab so I used 12 oz. of that rather than 1/2 shrimp 1/2 crab. This was more than enough meat so I did not double that part. I used a few shakes of Old Bay seasoning in the filling sauce a bit of paprika and about 3 shakes of Louisiana hot sauce for some kick. Any time that heavy cream was called for I used evaporated FF milk. As for cooking the eggs I cooked 1 cup of the eggs in a 10\" skillet and just kept rotating the pan rather than trying to flip it. I made 2 large omelets instead of several small ones. I used 1/2 the crab filling in each one on half the cooked omelet flipped it over and topped with cheese sauce. My husband thought it was to die for and it takes a great meal to truly impress him.",
