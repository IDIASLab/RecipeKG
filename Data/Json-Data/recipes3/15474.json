I found it very bland, and then realized no salt was in the recipe. I found it needed 2 tsp. (adjust to taste), and a good grate of pepper. It still was nothing special. I refrigerated it for a day or so and, oh my(!), what a wonderful improvement. The dill became redolent in the soup. I added a squeeze of lemon and a spoon of sour cream and it was irresistible! So - when you first make it - remember - it does need the day or so in the refrigerator. It's on my keeper list!",

It's much faster, adds nice flavor and you can eat it right away. I also added some juices from the can (about 1/4cup). \n2. Add either some water or stock from boiling potatoes. Just until the soup is desired consistency.  I added about a cup. \n3. Fresh dill is very important, won't taste right with dried kind.\n4. It needs a little salt (to taste). \n5. Traditionally this soup is served with dill potatoes (boil potatoes, then lightly fry them in some oil and then sprinkle with dill, salt and pepper to taste.)",

If you can't find kefyras/kefir, add a generous amount of sour cream to your butter milk. If you say buttermilk here, maybe it should say that this recipe is modified \u0161altibar\u0161ciai version. I believe it's probably alright, but I won't risk making my beloved national dish without kefir. After moving in Japan, where they don't make kefir, I had to buy kefir starter and make my own from regular milk (of course, buttermilk's fine to make kefir too). \nAs far as recipes go, we use: kefir, beets, chives, boiled eggs, fresh cucumbers, dills, mix in some sour cream before serving, and actually don't have to wait one whole day before eating it. Serving with boiled potatoes, boiled dill potatoes, boiled then fried potatoes (last one is popular recently in my home country). And congrats to everyone who still remembers, today is a great jubilee of Lithuanian country.",
