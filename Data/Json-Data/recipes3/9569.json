Left some of the broccoli on the side to.add later along with the steamed potato; this added a heartiness that a completely pureed soup lacks.

Garlic only needs about 2-3 minutes. I added shredded carrots and saut\u00e9ed celery with onions. Much needed flavor. Other than that this is a decent base recipe. I always use instant potato flakes to thicken gravies and cream based soups. Healthier, gluten, free and simpler!",
