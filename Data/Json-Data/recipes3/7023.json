I seasoned my chicken \"twice\". Basically I seasoned it turmeric, chilli powder, salt and about 3 tablespoons of ginger-garlic paste and allowed it to sit overnight; then on the day I was gonna prepare it, I made the marinade as per the instructions with the exceptions noted above and let it soak for about 4 hours. I added some cumin seeds before the onions, then basically followed the instructions.",

Note: I had to add a few tablespoons of water towards the end, as the chicken was not fully cooked and was beginning to stick to the pan. Also added a pinch more salt and cilantro for extra flavor. Marinating over night helped too. So easy! A definite keeper :) Thank you for this recipe.",
