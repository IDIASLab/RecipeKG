HINT: to prevent over watery slaw place the cabbage in a strainer and coat/toss with plenty of salt. Put the strainer on top of a bowl and let it sit for about an hour. You will see all the excess water in the bowl from the cabbage. RINSE IT WELL until the salt taste is gone. Then mix rinsed cabbage with the other ingredients and let it sit over night. The \"empty\" cabbage will then be able to soak up the flavors of the vinegar honey and seasonings. This will totally change your slaw taste.",
