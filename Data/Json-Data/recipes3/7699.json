(At least the grill marks looked really cool...) Hubs was less than enthusiastic about these when he learned there were sun-dried tomatoes in them. I on the other hand was excited to try this interesting and mouth-watering combination of ingredients. After setting off the alarm then hurrying to take a picture of them before they got cold I had all but lost interest in them and just wanted to get supper over with. We sat down to eat and our first response was of raised eyebrows and a \"Wow these are really good!\" Hubs ended up not finishing the soup we had with these just so that he could have a second burger and I was glad I only made three so I couldn't have a second one myself. What a delicious unique kind of unusual hard to describe but wonderful flavor these had! And don't think for a minute that these are little mini-meatloaves what with the breadcrumbs and egg - there isn't enough of either to make that error. While these just as easily could be served on regular hamburger rolls or ciabatta bread there was something special about the toasted and buttered English muffins. A little tomato and lettuce was all that was needed to complete this wonderful burger. Really pleased with your recipe Chester! As hubs put it this took the simple burger to the next level!",

I used Italian-style bread crumbs and choppd the green bell pepper very fine (using about half the amount) as I didn't want to have any unwanted \"crunch\" in my burger. The addition of the Tabasco gave it a really nice kick! I got four nice sized patties out this and chose to grill these as burgers fried in a pan tend to be \"greasy\" and don't have the same flavor that comes from being cooked on a grill - personal preference I suppose. I was lucky enough to find the \"sandwich-sized\" English muffins at my grocery store and toasted them which was a nice change from regular hamburger rolls - maybe it was due to those famous \"nooks and crannies\". These were excellent topped with Cheddar cheese lettuce and tomato - YUM!",
