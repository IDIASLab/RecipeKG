He liked it a whole bunch and he likes my cooking but I've never heard him go on like this. So it gets five stars from me.",

I liked the extra twirl over penne. I added one packet of Good Seasonings Zesty Italian when cooking the meat, and used 4oz of fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I put 1/2 the cheese on top.  I also used a Corningware deep white circular dish and kept the glass lid on until the last 10 min of cooking.  This kept the edges moist and let the cheese brown at the end.",
