I was hesitant about the cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, but followed the recipe's instructions, and the end product isn't \"too\" any of that. It's just right. Interestingly, I believe the \"sweet\" spices are what adds the \"comfort\" to this soup--there IS something unidentifiably \"homey\" about the flavor, and I'm pretty sure it's the sweet spices. As far as changes went: I reduced the butter, reduced the salt, and added 5 oz. fresh spinach at the end after I removed the soup from the heat, simply because it needed to go. Thanks for the recipe!",

My 11 year old brother isn't a fan of red peppers and refused to eat them so I put his bowl into the Magic Bullet and made it into a shake for him. If you have young kids who don't want to eat the veggies and you want to hide the goods a hand blender would work well too; right into the pot. My mom thought it would be a smart idea to put grated cheese into the soup: NOT RECOMMENDED! It stuck right to the bottom. But over all YUMMY soup!",
