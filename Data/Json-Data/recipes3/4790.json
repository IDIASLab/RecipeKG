I think next time and there will be a next time I will use the old tried and true method of dredge egg then crumb and I also think I'll do a deep fry number on them. The gravy was just to die for my son the little picky thing just loved it! I used a little more butter in it and I used cornstarch to thicken instead of the flour. It really is a great recipe.

I cantt eat fried stuff so I just tossed them with the spices then sauteed them in bacon grease. Best frogs legs we've ever had. I bet they would be great fried too though. The gravy however I would rate at about a 3. Its nothing to write home about and takes the attention away from the frog. I won't bother with that in the future.",
