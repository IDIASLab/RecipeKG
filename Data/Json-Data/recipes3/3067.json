I made a few changes, however, to spice it up and add flavor after reading some of the other reviews.  1: add 1 tsp. cumin powder to onions/garlic while cooking, 2: add one small can of diced mild chiles when you add the beans, 3: use broth (any kind) instead of water.  Also diminish the amount of liquid to 2 cups instead of 2 and a 1/2.  Hope this helps!  Thanks for a yummy recipe!",

One criticism of most recipes that include rice as an ingredient is that the authors rarely tell you what kind of rice they used. This is of prime importance as it can mean success or failure to the dish. The are MANY types of rice ech with different flavors texture cooking time ratio of water to rice aromas stickiness etc. A variety of rice that is great for one dish will spell trouble for another. SO please in the future ALWAYS include the type and even the brand of rice you used. It will make you recipes much better.",

She swears by Mr. Goudas brand rice (never buy the generic stuff) and her west indian friends buy this brand as well.  Generic rice tends to turn out too sticky 2) I use a ratio of 2:1 of liquid to rice.  My mom always tells me it's better to add more water at the end than to start off with too much liquid at the beginning which you can't fix later.  The rice was the perfect consistency when done.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.",
