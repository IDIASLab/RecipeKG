I melted about 1/3 cup butter and sauted about 3 cloves of garlic and 3 green onions. I added about 4 tbsp milk to get all the yummy garlic flavor out. I added salt and pepper to the butter mixture and added about 1/4 cup sour cream to the potatoes. I mixed it all together with shredded cheddar cheese (1/4 cup). I topped the refilled shells with shredded mozzerella and sprinkled paprika on top. Baked again for 20 minutes. Yum.",
