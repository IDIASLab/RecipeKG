However, you must use olive oil and we also add fresh chopped parsley and 1 small minced jalapeno(no seeds). lemon and salt to taste.  It is best served at room temperature once refridgerated the oil can harden..just let it sit out for few minutes before serving.  Great with warm bread for dipping.",
