I usually just throw this together with however much I have of the ingredients, so trying to figure out measurements is a challenge.  Be sure to suit your own tastes with the dressing using more or less mayonnaise, pickle juice, salt and pepper.",

All of the flavors textures and colors worked beautifully together. You may be tempted to add to it - but for the first batch don't. There are many ingredients that would lend themselves nicely but this is a 5-star salad on its own. Thanks Laurie!",

The funny thing is, I have an account here and didn't come up when I looked up beets and hard-boiled eggs. :( Oh well, I's so happy you have it! It tastes just like what I grew up with, I only omitted the pickles and pickle juice and added a little vinegar instead. I had never heard of pickles until I came here so I am SURE my mom didn't used to put them in there. Thanks so much!!! (PS I still remember my kindergarten class making me bring 2 hard-boiled eggs so we could make this together ",
