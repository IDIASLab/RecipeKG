I followed the recipe except I added 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar to the kraut mix and coated my 2.5 lb roast with 4 oz of unsweetened applesauce to prevent drying. Those little individual cups of applesauce are convenient. Big hit with husband and I'll make again. A good dinner for guests IF they like kraut.",

I was a little concerned about the addition of the mushroom soup (mushrooms and sauerkraut?) but it ended up lending a nice creaminess to the kraut with no obvious mushroom flavor. I hurried the cooking by cooking the pork longer than just to brown sauteing the onions a bit and warming the soup/kraut/apple/cranberry mixture in the microwave. This cut the cooking time to under an hour. We'll be making this again and maybe trying adding a few more spices/herbs to it.",
