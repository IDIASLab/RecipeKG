The objective is to marinate the chicken(which I cut up in 4 pieces)in a paste not a liquid as the recipe stipulates. So forget about the wine and reduce the olive oil to 3 tablespoons. I also added the juice of the lemon I zested. The amount of parsley I used was about 1/2 cup after going through the food processor. All of the other herbs were dried. Also I only used 4 cloves of garlic and 1 tablespoon of pepper. I only marinated the chicken 2 hours.",

I also had a porblem with truely understanding what the marinade was supposed be like. ALthough the chicken turned out fine and I used the leftovers for a soup recipe I found here (5 star) the smell of it baking was a little overwhelming unless you like the smell garlic I wouldn't suggest cooking this when there's a lot of people around.:) Of course I could have screwed something up to but it turned out ok.",
