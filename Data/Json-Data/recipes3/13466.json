Made as written but added 1/4 teaspoon Italian Seasoning. Was concerned the expired chopped Crescents roll dough wouldn't cook fully so added 5 minutes and they tasted great like tiny biscuits/dumplings. The bread crumbs made a very brown crust. Next time will add 1/4 to 1/2 cup each of the turkey and veggies plus double Italian Seasoning.",

                "reviewBody": "I was looking for something to do with leftover Thanksgiving turkey and happened upon this recipe.  I had all the ingredients including a can of crescent rolls which had been languishing in my frig forever.   I made it pretty much as directed except I used Italian Seasoned Panko Bread Crumbs for the topping.  I think this was an important change as the casserole itself had no seasoning without it.  The crescent rolls were cut into approximately 1/2 x 1/2 inch squares but did not fully cook which was somewhat disturbing to be eating raw dough.  I know it was supposed to be dumpling like but it was not.  I wonder if possibly baking them slightly ahead of time would have helped, or maybe cutting them into smaller pieces.  Anyway, I found this to be very good and will try to remember it to make again.",
