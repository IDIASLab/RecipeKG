Now am I supposed to actually make the yellow cake mix according to the box/package that it comes in and then start following the Rolo recipe or only use the yellow cake mix powder itself and then start adding the nuts butter and milk etc.?? If anyone could give a hand it would be greatly appreciated! Good Day and thanks!",
