I wasn't sure whether the recipe called for fresh jalape\u00f1os, but I used pickled slices in brine and they worked great.  The only note I have is to allow for a lot longer initial cooking time for the sweet potatoes: I had to bake them for 50+ minutes before they were tender enough to mash.",

The skin slides off really easily I didn't worry about leaving a base of yam just used a bare skin. 2. I used a full 8 oz. block of cheddar 3. I cooked the bacon in my air fryer and just used a small amount of the fat to sautee the scallions and jalapenos. I thought the grease from that much bacon was just too much to put into the yam mixture 4. I used a full 4 oz. of sour cream I cooked them ahead of time to bring to our family Thanksgiving and just reheated then when we got there. Everyone loved them. I'm going to make them again for my Christmas party!",
