Melt the gorgonzola in the cream adding a little white wine to thin if needed. Add (or not) chopped walnuts to the finished sauce - and that's it! Take care when buying gorgonzola as it comes in creamy and extra salty sand pungent. In Italy we traditionally use the creamy gorgonzola for this sauce.",

I added a small bulb of garlic to saute with the butter used half&half to make it richer 1 and 1/4 cups of gorgonzola cheese heated long enough to melt most of the cheese then tossed it with hot tortelloni and topped it off with fresh dungeness crab...it was an excellent meal fit to be served in a restaurant. My sister who doesn't like gorgonzola or bleu cheese loved this dish!!",

We followed the directions exactly and even added a whole cup of gorgonzola, and could not taste the cheese at all. If I would make this again I would only make half the amount of sauce.  Three cups was way too much for one pound of pasta anyways.  If you cut the milk, butter, and flour in half and use 1 cup of cheese I think you might get a nice flavorful sauce then.",
