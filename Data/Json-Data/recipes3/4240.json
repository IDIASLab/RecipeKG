The second time I made them I seasoned the flour with garlic, ginger, salt, and pepper and they were fantastic! Such a small change made such a big difference in flavor!! My 9yr old that rarely eats much meat ate 6 of these...not sure where he put them ;-) Served with jasmine rice, stir fry veggies(frozen bag of stir fry blend + bag frozen broccoli), and buttered potatoes(chinese buffet style)...but the pork chops are always the highlight of the meal!!",
