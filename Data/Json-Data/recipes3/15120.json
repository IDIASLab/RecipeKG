I had some fresh basil that needed to be used so I chopped that up and put in onto the breasts too. Topped with Roma tomatoes and mozzarella per the recipe. Topped that  with just a pinch of fresh shredded parm and oregano. I used italian cut green beans in place of the broccoli (was on hand) served with brown rice cooked in tomato chicken bouillon. Fantastic and easy to make. Always looking for ways to make chicken taste better without making it too unhealthy and this was perfect. Thanks for sharing.",

Per the other reviewers, I agree to watch both the salt and oil amount for the broccoli since the pesto definitely works it\u2019s way to the pan with the broccoli as well. It\u2019s delicious, but could get overly oily if you overdo the olive oil on the broccoli.",
