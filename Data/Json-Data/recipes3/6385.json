However with okra that needed used I proceeded to see if I could salvage this dish.  I used 1 lb. of okra sliced 1/4\" thick; added all 6 pks of instant grits; salt and pepper, 1 tsp and 1/4 tsp respectively.  I used the 2 eggs and about 3/4 cup of buttermilk.  I did not use the tomato or onion, but in retrospect the onion would have been good--pureed. And if you did use tomato then I'd cut back on liquid.  And cook time is 3-4 minutes per side.  They were tastier if not cooked to death at 5 mins per side.  In the end it was good and my family said they liked it better than just breading and frying okra like it is usually served.  However mind did not look at all \"batter-y\" like the photo provided.  I think that could be the type of instant grits or some flour was added to achieve that--my best guess.  Either way the original recipe is not viable.  But with some adjustments it can be very tasty.",
