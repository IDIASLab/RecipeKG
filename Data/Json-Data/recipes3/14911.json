A piece of advice for the breading that falls off - after coating the wings in the cornflake mixture stick it in the fridge for an hour or the freezer for 30 minutes before baking them. The cold will make the breading actually \"stick\" to the chicken. I can't wait to try this recipe I absolutely LOVE honeyed wings.",

I was hesitant on putting that much pepper flakes into the honey but decided to do it anyway. I am glad that I tried one before putting it on all the wings because it was waaaaaaay too spicy like I lost my breath spicy but maybe that's just me because the other reviews had no issue with the heat. I fixed it simply by straining the pepper flakes out of the honey and starting over with less. I ended up with just enough heat for us. These really are everthing they say they are crunchy spicy sticky and sweet-a GREAT combination! I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
