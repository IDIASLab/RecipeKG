                "reviewBody": "This was very good easy and healthy. It was a bit salty but I think it was because I doubled the vinegar and soy sauce to account for the extra crab meat I had. Also I dipped Wheat Thins into the salad which also had salt on them. I added a little bit of ground ginger. I will make this regularly especially in the summer. I think it would be good as a dip with cream cheese and avocado (there goes the healthy part). I am looking for suggestions of how other people served this salad. Update: I have made this a couple times now and each time I reduce the soy sauce and vinegar. The crab and cuke at the bottom of the dish get very strong soy sauce/vinegar taste from soaking up the juices. It becomes too strong to eat if it has sat for 1 to 2 days or so. So watch out how much you use.",
