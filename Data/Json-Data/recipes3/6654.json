I made it easy on myself and just microwaved the spinach to wilt it adding it little by little to my microwave dish every 30 seconds or so as it wilted down. I loved the bechamel sauce with the touch of nutmeg (I used fresh) but I didn't bother to use hot milk - cold worked just fine - and I found I had to use a little more of it even tho' I didn't cook it for 10 minutes - it wasn't necessary when you scale this down to one serving which was an 8 oz. bag of baby spinach. Also I knew immediately that 10 minutes under the broiler would be far too long - just a couple/few minutes turned out to all it needed. This is a little elegant a little gourmet and very very good not to mention blessedly neither too rich nor too heavy.",

I made it for a Christmas meal everybody said it was good but don't think it was a huge favorite either except for fellow spinach lovers. I made as the recipe stated except didn't warm the milk. My bechamel sauce turned out great but next time I will mix this in with the spinach rather than just put on top. I think that would help even out the flavoring.
