When I reheated the leftovers the cream separated a bit and gave it almost a cheesy consistency and flavor. So the next time I made this I added a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese sprinkled over it at the end of cooking and the flavor was even better. I also added a minced clove of garlic to the onions when cooking for extra flavor. I'm thinking this might also be a good base for tomato sauce instead of the cream for and Italian flavor.",

That amount of salt is probably meant to be sprinkled on the cucumbers in a colander so that they will drain their excess water. I always rinse the drained cucumbers and pat dry before proceeding with the recipe. Maybe the heavy cream was meant to be a substitute for the sour cream. I would imagine that using both would be very good. I used much more than a pinch of dill. Even our most dubious tasters rated it highly!",
