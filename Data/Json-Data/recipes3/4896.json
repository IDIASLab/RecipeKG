                "reviewBody": "This IS a great recipe. I altered it slightly by using the Ore-Ida hashbrowns (the shredded kind) and sprinkling diced tomatoes and green onions just before adding the cheese and gave it great color. I also used 6 eggs for volume and whisked them separately as in the other review. The result was a thicker and fluffier frittata that made a great main course for breakfast. You could also add sliced black olives and a dollop of sour cream for a lunch or dinner dish. The only thing I would change is reduce the first baking time to 7 minutes and once you put the tomatoes, green onion, and cheese on, the cheese takes longer to get all bubbly, so I had to bake it for another 7-8 minutes in addition to the first 10 and it made the eggs kind of dry. Next time I make it, I will try it with the Ore-Ida cubed potatoes. ",
