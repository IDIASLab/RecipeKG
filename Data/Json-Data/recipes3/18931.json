                "reviewBody": "3.30.19 I bought a 10.2 oz can of Pillsbury Butter Tastin Grands which had 5 jumbo biscuits so I just cut them in half and ended up with 10 knots instead of 12. The biscuit dough is very elastic so when you roll it out and stretch it it tends to spring back. It was next to impossible to get a 6 strip which sure would have made it easier to tie a knot in the center. Now about tying that knot there must be a learning curve involved because what I ended up with was not pretty but they did taste quite good. The oil mixture is a very nice blend of ingredients and don t worry about the chili powder like I did because it doesn t overpower. Just keep in mind that you re using a biscuit for quick preparation so don t expect them to taste totally like a roll but I got no complaints serving them with dinner. (Just don t tell anybody you started with canned biscuits and they may not figure it out!) I will make this recipe again and just maybe with a little practice I can get those knots looking a little better. St3ph thanks for sharing your recipe it's an interesting one.",
