I also used a sharp cheddar cheese in addition to the American. I found Ritz crackers were tastier than the croutons, and adding a 1/4 cup of half-and-half to the soup and cheese mix made it a bit creamier. Overall, a very good casserole, just remember a small pinch of salt is all it needs. Enjoy!",

Unlike the other recipes, this once calls for fresh broccoli, which by far is much tastier than the frozen kind, which comes mostly in chopped up little stems.  I used cream of celery and mushroom, and prefer the celery- which has a lighter flavor.  And 1 cup of cheddar was plenty of cheese.  I followed another reviewer's tip and use just a pinch of salt and 1/2 of the pepper, which is much better.  Overall, a great, fresh tasting dish and not too salty or rich.  I used buttered Ritz crackers instead of croutons-- much tastier.  This one is a keeper.  My 4 and 1 yr. loved it- and that's all that matters!",

It was gobbled up in minutes.  I made a lot of changes though, so heres what I did.  I used just half a tsp of salt instead of one and a half, added a can of cream of chicken soup as well as used cream of mushroom and garlic instead of regular cream of mushroom.  I added a cup and a half of fresh mushrooms, sliced and a pound of crispy bacon, crumbled.  For the topping, I used crushed Ritz crackers and a quarter cup of grated parmesan cheese instead of the croutons.  Oh, and I used 3 cups of cheddar cheese instead of 8 ounces of american.  Absolutely to die for!!! will definately be making this again.",

Oh yeah I added a little (and I mean little) bit of garlic powder and about 1/4 cup milk.(The mix of soup and cheese seemed to thick for me)IT TURNED OUT VERY CREAMY AND THE TASTE OF FRESH CRACKED PEPPER.....YUMMY:o) I am attending a X-mas dinner party on the 24th and this is the vegetable dish that I will be bringing!",

I covered it in crushed stuffing instead of crutons. It was not too salty and was moist without being soupy. Thanks for all the suggestions!",

Good enough to sit down and eat a large bowl of this for dinner and nothing else. I did not have the croutons therefore left them out. However I did add 1/2 cup fresh mushrooms to the sauce. It was delicious. I would cut the pepper amount in half next time. It was a little warm. Other than that it was great. Next time I may add some penne pasta and bite size chicken pieces. Would make a great pasta! Thanks for the recipe.",
