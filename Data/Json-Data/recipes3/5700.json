The recipe fails to include the fact that the balls of meat should be pressed flat (think oval-shaped hamburger patties) before the dough is wrapped around them. For the health-conscious even though it's not \"traditional \" the fleishkuechle may also be baked. Around here we would NEVER detract from the flavor by adding cheese but we do love to dip them in ketchup!!",

Growing up I had these at the local dairy queens/restaurants on my lunch break almost daily!  They are made with chopped onion and water in the blender, then add that to seasoned hamburger for a spreadable meat. Then take a dough ball about the size of a lemon and roll out to a circle just slightly smaller that the size of a plate. Spread meat mixture on 1/2 of the dough, fold over and seal by pinching or with a fork. Prick twice with a fork to let steam escape while deep frying. They are flat, and about the size of 1/2 of a plate, but can be made smaller. If made correctly there is a little grease that makes the inside dough slightly oily. That adds flavor. They freeze very well! No cheese!! ONLY KETCHUP!!! :)\nWe pronounce it fly(sh)-keek-la.   ",

She always makes a macaroni salad with lots of pickles to go with it and I think it's a nice way to balance the hearty juiciness of the Fleischkuechle. I know she also got this recipe handed down to her from her German family so anyone who says it's not \"real\" because it doesn't use moldy old bread or whatever needs to let me know so I can be sure to call them a waaaambulance.
