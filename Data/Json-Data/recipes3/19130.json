This was the perfect time to pull them out of the cabinet and give this recipe a test run.  I made half a recipe using 1 pkg of reduced fat cream cheese, and the batter fit perfectly into my single pan.  Followed the directions to the letter, and this turned out surprisingly well.  The texture is spot on cheesecake, and I really didn\u2019t even miss the crust.  My husband said he does enjoy the crust, but he enjoyed this, and it disappeared pretty quickly.  This is so darn easy to make with minimal cleanup, and has nice presentation.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

I used 1/2 Just Like Sugar sugar substitute and 1/2 regular sugar (personal taste). The Just Like Sugar worked great but  since we don\u2019t need to watch our sugars,  I will just use all regular sugar next time. I would recommend cutting parchment to fit the bottom of the pan and placing that on the greased pan being sure to grease the parchment before adding the cheese mixture. This will help the cheesecake slide off the pan. I did have to run a knife carefully  around the inside of the pan to release the sides.",
