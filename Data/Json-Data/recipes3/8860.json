The SCM came out a little runny so I wonder if the Paleta mixture was affected because of it. Final product (before freezing) was rather soupy plus the coconut and pineapple wanted to rise to the top. I went ahead and gave 5 stars because it was easy to make and tasted absolutly divine! Truely reminded of Mexican Paletas. I might make again but I prefer not to use SCM from a can. So if I do then I will just make my own again or try another recipe without SCM.
