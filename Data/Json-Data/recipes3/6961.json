I don t know if this was the submitter s oversight or a deliberate omission but I ve never heard of ice cream without sugar probably because it just wouldn t taste good. I also was uncomfortable with the cooking method (I used the traditional tempering method) didn t care for the addition of the chopped espresso beans and knew the amount of caramel topping called for would be too skimpy for me. So I first scaled the recipe to 5 servings to accommodate my 1-1/2 quart ice cream maker using 2 c. cream and 1 c. whole milk. I used cold fresh brewed espresso which I believe makes this extraordinarily good. We have an espresso machine but if you don t I d recommend just going to your local coffeehouse and buying a cup just to use for this ice cream! I ve made a similar ice cream using instant espresso which was very good but it still didn t compare to using the freshly brewed! I probably doubled the amount of caramel topping and skipped the espresso beans but used them for garnish. Most important I added sugar 3/4 c. for this scaled down 5-serving recipe. In other words for each cup of milk or cream add c. sugar! Words cannot express how incredibly good this is so as this recipe s first reviewer I cannot rate this the 2-stars I feel it deserves as written and discourage others from trying it when I believe the mere addition of a little sugar elevates this to something celestial.",

I have instant espresso powder I use for baking and brewed 4 ounces of hot water then added about a tablespoon of instant espresso powder it gave the ice cream great flavor. I didn't have chocolate covered espresso beans on hand (I mean how many people really do?) so I substituted mini chocolate chips...after all it does say Espresso Chip Ice Cream not Espresso Chocolate Covered Espresso Bean Ice Cream. The mixture fit perfectly in my Kitchen Aid mixer ice cream attachment. I thought the taste was wonderful...I couldn't image making it without sugar and I really didn't add a whole lot. I wasn't crazy about the mini chips in it but everyone else loved them. I really liked the caramel swirl which I probably didn't add 3/4 cup more like 1/2 cup because that was all I had left over of my ice cream topping. I do not suggest making this without sugar.",
