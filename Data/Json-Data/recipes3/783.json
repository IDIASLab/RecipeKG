It's a lot less messy than sprinkles (and cheaper too!) but if you really want the sugar add some plain sugar to the paint or sprikle some on after you paint. This is great for a group to do too. All you need is some of those cheap little water color brushes for kids from the dollar store. Eggs paints let you be creative and even if you your not an artists the cookis look so pretty anyway! Try this if you haven't already;O).",
