I think the amount is necessary to solidify in the refridgerator and hold the cookies together.  \nI did not use the optional cherrys.  I also did them with both unsweetened and semi-sweet chocolate and both tasted good.\nIf you love mounds bars you'll love these because they taste just like them.  I was asked for the recipe by several people.  We all wondered if maybe adding an almond would result in an Almond Joy.  I am pretty sure it would.\nI recommend doing the recipe as stated and you will have complete satisfaction.",

This was quick and almost a one bowl job...which was a plus. I didn't have any chocolate chips on hand but when I dug around I found a package of individually wrapped Dove dark chocolate hearts. I melted these with a little shortening and they worked fine. I didn't use as much butter called for because I didn't want a buttery taste. The only problem I had was my chocolate got a little dry and crumbly after being refrigerated but that's my fault. It certainly didn't stop us from eating them! Thanks June.",
