That worked very well and took less time to prepare than brushing with oil. They turned out somewhat soft after cooking 15 min on one side and 10 min on the other (thinner ones were turning too brown). Even if they weren't crisp I still enjoyed them and liked not having to hover over the stove for frying. I'll definitely make this again and work on the cooking time. I forgot to take a photo I ate them too fast!",

Another thing is that I say \" don't forget to put oil on the bottom of your chips before you put it in the oven or it will stick onto the pan. Other wise it is great and I will be looking for more taro root recipes.",
