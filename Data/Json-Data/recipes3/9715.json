FYI\n\nTo me, 'done' is when you can hole 1 cool bean between your thumb and forefinger and it will collapse totally when you squeeze it. Or you can use a spoon or anything that is flat .... key is there should be little or NO resistance when you push down on bean. You can eat one as well after it's cool .... you should feel NO hardness.\n\nBut, please leave off the salt until beans are done or very close to being done. \n\nNOTE: If you want to use salt, use it in water you soak beans in overnight or for a few hours.  Then be sure to rinse the beans well before cooking.  Some add baking soda as well in the overnight soak.\n\nAnd doing a few minutes in a pressure cooker will reduce total cooking time as well.",
