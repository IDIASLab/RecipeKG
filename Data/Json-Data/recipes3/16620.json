I made them for my sister who just had a baby and froze a batch for myself. They froze well and re-heated great. They were SO moist. The mozzarella cheese is a fantastic addition. \n\nIt was my first time working with phyllo dough, so it took a little getting used to, but just follow the package directions. You have to keep the sheets moist that you aren't working with at the moment, but not too moist or they get gummy and unusable. \n\n2 things to note:  We cut the sheets of phyllo into 3 strips instead of 4. Found they were too small when we cut it into 4 and difficult to fold. The other thing is this recipe says to use unsalted butter between the sheets, but we didn't have any so we used salted. The phyllo dough package didn't specify so I think you would be fine with either.\n\nDELICIOUS recipe, thanks for sharing!!!",
