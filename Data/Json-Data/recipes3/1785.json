Without wheat flour and yeast, it won't be true bread. But if you're off carbs, and have been dreaming about a nice slice of buttered toast with your eggs, this is well worth a try. It tastes relatively neutral, with a very subtle egginess and faint almond flavor, and a texture reminiscent of an extra moist and spongy white bread.",

I used 1/4 tsp. salt  which seemed to be just right for me.  Other breads that use cheese in the mix are good,  but this one is the closest to real bread in  taste and texture.  I think this will make a good 'pound cake' with some vanilla and erythritol sugar maybe. I will make again...and again....",
