I didn't measure any of the add-ins, just did everything to taste. LOVED the fresh basil in this! Oh, I didn't have any asiago on hand, so I used parmesan, which was great. This was a nice, different pasta salad, that I will def be making again! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Contrary to the receipe title I did not find this very quick to prepare and all the yummy and pricey ingredients were lost in a sea of noodles at the end. I also had some issues with the cheese: the thinly sliced provolone didn't agree with the other ingredeints shape-wise and the grated asiago became a little clumpy when tossed in with the dressing. I could see these ingredients transformed into a very yummy sandwich though - just substitute bread for noodles and reduce the vinegar to a splash once assembled.",

I changed the olives to Lindsay green olives sliced in half and used a half a can. I just used about a teaspoon of dried basil and a teaspoon of dried oregano instead of the fresh basil. I mixed all the ingredients together before I mixed in the vinaigrette. I think that makes sure everything doesn't clump together. Turned out really great!",
