                "reviewBody": "Eight oz. of mushrooms for 5 eggs?  A whole onion?  Even more startling, 1-1/2 TABLESPOONS of Italian seasoning?  For 5 eggs?  Especially regarding the seasoning, one could reasonably assume this has to be a typo!  That said, if I were to rate this recipe according to these measurements, I would assign it one star, and according to AR\u2019s guidelines, that means inedible.  If I were to rate this, however, on more sensible measurements, I would rate this 5 stars.  Not only did I not use 1-1/2 T. of Italian seasoning, I used none at all \u2013 because I don\u2019t use \u201cItalian\u201d seasoning.  But if I was to use it, I\u2019d use a more reasonable 1/4-1/2 tsp. \u2013 \u201cto taste\u201d if you will.  Besides, garlic and herb Boursin has quite a lot of flavor on its own and because of it you\u2019d be pushing it with extra seasoning.  I did, however, add some chopped fresh chives to compensate for omitting the \u201cItalian\u201d seasoning.  As for the mushrooms and onions, I added what looked right to me, and it was far less than what the recipe directed.  The Boursin added a pleasant, subtle, herby creaminess, and while the mozzarella didn\u2019t contribute much flavor, it added a decadent gooiness.  So in the final analysis, made as directed with at least one possible typo (the amount of Italian seasoning) this would be 1-star inedible.  With more conservative amounts of everything, we loved it, 5 stars.  In fairness, I\u2019ll rate it midway in between at 3 stars, which assumes the reader takes into account these considerations.",
