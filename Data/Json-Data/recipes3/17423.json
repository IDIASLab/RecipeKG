I don't ususally use a can of crabmeat I like to finely shred a big handful of immitation crab meat or use both if you like one can isn't enough and I definately don't use a whole jalepeno half is plenty. Don't forget to add some old bay or other favorite seasonings either! Put whatever you like in the stuffing just as long as it holds together in a small clump stuffed inside the butterflied shrimp. This stuff is also excellent when warmed up the next day in the microwave. Julie",

My guess is that it will really perk this up a lot! The filling does seem a bit dry but maybe a bit of wine or brandy would help with that.",
