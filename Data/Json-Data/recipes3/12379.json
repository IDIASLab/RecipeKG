I had a medium sized eggplant and I sliced it and used 12 slices (6 stacks of 2) for this recipe and still had a few slices left over for another use. I kept all of the rest of the ingredients as is and substituted green onions for the leeks as that is what I had on hand. I served these over a bed of angel hair pasta tossed in a light marinara sauce. My Italian husband suggested adding a slice of mortadella between the layers next time! Sounds good to me but they were terrific as is as well! Will make again!",
