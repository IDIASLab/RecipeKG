But this recipe was actually quite good and easy to make. The only thing I did different from the directions was to cook it for about an extra five minutes because I wanted the mac and cheese to be a little crunchy around the edges. When I make it again I think I will shred a little parmesan under the tots. The cauliflower Veggie Tots were quite good and I look forward to making them as a side for burgers or brats.",
