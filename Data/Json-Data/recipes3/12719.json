The spelt was factory ground and kept frozen from the time I purchased it. Pancakes had a nice nutty/grainy texture. I used the common buttermilk sub of milk vinegar. I also swapped out 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of the cinnamon. I upped the maple syrup to 3 or 4 Tbsp since we do not eat them with syrup. I added about a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. Delicious!
