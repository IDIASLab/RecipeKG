Accordingly I made a few alterations but overall loved the recipe. I also crisped a few slices of bacon and threw them into the food processor instead of adding salt. I used skim milk and fish stock with sherry to finish in lieu of cream chicken bouillon and white wine. Overall the bisque absolutely kicked butt and everyone was mopping their bowls with bread (I may have even seen one of the women actually licking hers...) Everyone has their own tastes so I imagine that people will prefer their own variations and modifications but this was a great base for a new \"go-to\" salmon recipe for my repertoire. Thanks for a great recipe! Gonzo",
