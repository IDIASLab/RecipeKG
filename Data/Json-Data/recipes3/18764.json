So, I decided to make numerous easter eggs (like the size of a cadbury egg - with a flat bottom so they can stand on their own) and decorate them with different colored chocolates. I changed the recipe just alittle and added 1 t. vanilla. 1/2 creamy and 1/2 crunchy peanut butter AND I added about 1 cup of Rice Krispys.  After mixing, I shaped the eggs (I got 16 eggs from this recipe)  and put them in the freezer for about an hour.  I then dip each egg twice into the chocolate. (This takes a bit of time.) After that, I divided the white chocolate (& shortening) into smaller portions and added food coloring so I had White, Blue, Green and Pink colors.  Using a spoon and one color at a time, I 'sprayed' each egg using a swift motion back and forth across the pan the eggs were in.  I think they look very festive!! Happy Easter!",

We used half creamy and half crunchy peanut butter and used that new Baker's dipping chocolate to coat them. We doubled the recipe and had about 35 eggs. It took 4 of the little dipping tubs to coat all of the eggs, but I found it a LOT easier. We also used a little of the chocolate to \"stripe\" the eggs by going back and forth very fast with a chocolate covered fork. They were very pretty. We put them in paper muffin liners since we were taking them to a party. One more note for the candy novices like me -- when you combine the ingredients it seems very dry, but it really holds the shape so don't be scared!",

I was in a pinch and needed to make my own PB Eggs, my kids said that these were \"The Best\"  I used a good quality peanut butter (Jif) not the cheap stuff. The better brand of PB gives these a more PB taste...which is what we want. Also instead of the semi sweet chocolate and shortening,  I went to a bulk food store and bought Milk Chocolate melting wafers. Very yummy! I already have had people requesting me to make these to sell and orders for next year. Wow! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!!  I'm sure these will become a tradition in my household :)",

I followed suggestions of melting the butter and using crunchy PB but mixture was still v. crumbly so mixed in extra 1T milk and the mix came together. Eggs are very sweet (but SOOOOO yummy) so next time I will use 1/2 c. less powdered sugar and mixture probably won't be as crumbly. V. easy to shape - this batch made 36 walnut sized eggs. Didn't need to freeze the eggs for an hour - 10 minutes chilling time and the eggs were good to dip. Adding melted shortening to the chocolate thins the chocolate and makes dipping easier. 2x10 year olds and 1x4 year old made the eggs and dipped them within 1.5 hours. Excellent recipe - a real keeper!!",

After I made the eggs that turned out VERY dry and too sweet, I revisited the reviews to make sure I wasn't imaging that this recipe had received such high reviews.  I found that the majority of the 4 and 5 star reviews mention having to alter the recipe in some way to make up for the sweetness and dryness!  So, if you're thinking about making this recipe, please take the time to actually read the reviews and follow everyone's advice about adding more peanut butter or less sugar.  Unfortunately, I assumed that 4 or 5 stars meant that the recipe was a winner.",
