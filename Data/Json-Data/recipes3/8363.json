I used a cast iron skillet - didn't use medium heat - I pre-heated the oven to 425 and started roasted potatoes - I got the cast iron skillet hot - hot on the stove top and added Olive Oil and about 1 Tablespoon herb butter. Seared steak on one side until it released from the pan - the first side was well caramelized - flipped and seared for another 2 minutes and then into the hot oven for 10 minutes. The steaks were rare 130 degrees and tender. Let steaks rest for 5 minutes before serving. I served this with sauteed mushrooms - green beans and oven roasted potatoes.",

                "reviewBody": "The recipe above is mine but I wanted to update the recipe a bit since I have modified it quite a bit since it was first posted. Basically I agree with the first reviewer definitely use a cast iron skillet that is what I use as well and it should be quite hot but not so hot that the butter burns on contact... it's a bit of a juggling act as every stove is different as a guide the butter should sizzle vigorously but not burn before you add the steak... once the meat is in the pan you can increase temp to where it is sizzling nicely to get a nice sear. Also to make things simple for the herb butter I just stir it in a bowl these days and omit the wrapping and chilling... plus I increase the tarragon significantly to taste... 1 Tbsp is just not enough to get a good flavour imo... how much more I add depends on my mood but I often double it to 2 Tbsp... personal preference... and I did not specify but the garlic I use is usually roasted tho I have been known to cheat and add some powdered garlic as well. We love our garlic. I also do my steaks for about 7 minutes a side on my stove for medium rare (not 6 as the recipe suggests) but then again I always make sure my steaks are at LEAST 1.25 inches thick these days (thinner steaks than that are much harder to cook correctly to medium rare) but if your steaks are thinner that that (most grocery store cuts are) use the 6 minute time as a gauge for medium rare... for medium I add another minute per side.",
