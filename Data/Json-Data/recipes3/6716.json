Subtley flavored and pretty. Wonderful flavor, and I think to omit the Parmesan cheese would leave this sorely lacking. I can't comment on how this tastes the next day as I made this scaled to 2 servings and hubby and I ate every grain. In fact, I served this with \"Mushroom Stuffed Chicken Rollups\" tonight, also from this site, and I'll have to make this orzo again tomorrow night as hubby requested we have this same meal again tomorrow night! Thank you, kgwen, for your delicious recipe. We were in culinary heaven tonight!",

If you are still unsure about using sun dried tomatoes or if you aren't a tomato lover then try them in this dish or on a homemade pizza. Trust me!",

When using feta I sprinkle it on right before serving then with leftover I add it to the orzo after it cools. I drain my sundried tomatoes (doubling the amount called for) and cut them into 1/2 inch strips chiffonade the basil and add kalamata olives. We personally like the texture and distinct tastes better. This is a great dish as you can serve warm with dinner as a side dish and have a great cold salad for lunch the next day.",
