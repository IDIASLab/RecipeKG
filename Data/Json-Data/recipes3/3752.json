The original calls out 2/3 cup of heavy (whipping) cream, not 1 cup.  And as you might have guessed, the \"corn meal\" is a typo, that should be corn starch.  The prep time has been understated a little - don't underestimate the time required to chop 4 cloves, 1 onion and _finely_ chop 3 potatoes.  This is a wonderful soup, always a huge hit with guests.  Be careful with the cayenne pepper though! 1/2 tsp with a full recipe will make it plenty spicy, add more at your own risk.",
