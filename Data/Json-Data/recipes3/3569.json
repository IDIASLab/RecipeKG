For extra punch thicken with a giant can of undiluted chicken soup instead of flour (which also will stretch the leftovers by the way) If you're garlic and onion freaks like my family double both ingredients (at least). I served the dish with rice pilaf and a very simple mixed-fruit salad and people called the next day for the recipe.",
