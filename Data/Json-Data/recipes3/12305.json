A great-tasting, gluten-free breakfast treat that's great with some blueberry or other fruit syrup. This recipe converted my wife from a non-pancake eater! Keep finished pancakes warm on a plate in a 150 degree F (65 degree C) oven while cooking the rest of the batter.",

I made a second batch using 1/2 cup buckwheat, 1/4 cup quinoa, and 1/4 cup gf all purpose flour and my kids liked those better. They whip up in minutes and cook up quickly, too. They aren't too heavy nor too light and crumbly, just a real pancake you can eat with a fork. The batter seems runny and thin at first, give it a second, as you wait to put them on the griddle, the batter thickens. I made these for dinner and put the leftovers in the fridge. They were perfect the next morning after 1 minute in the microwave. Thank you for the recipe.",
