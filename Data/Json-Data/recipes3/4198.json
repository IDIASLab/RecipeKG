For me this recipe needs improvement. I cut the sausage into slices and set aside reserving two patties to be crumbled and placed back in the gravy at the end. With the sausage being salty already I think that the salt in the recipe is too much. I had to use more black pepper for our tastes than listed here and we don't care for the green onions. You have to play with flour and milk amounts so I think that that is understood by most gravy cooks. Also speed of your wrist (stirring) and heat play a factor. By the way you can sub ham for the sausage and call it red-eye gravy.",

When the gravy was thickened to my liking I just added the crumbled sausage to it spooned it over homemade biscuits and topped each biscuit with a fried egg. Thanks for the memories!

I noticed there is over 50% of your day's sodium in just a single serving of this recipe. Seasoned sausage has plenty of salt in it I would suggest adding a couple pinches of cracked pepper and a pinch of either thyme or sage. I also let the flour gently brown a bit more than called for here and used about twice as much gravy to sausage-it was wonderful. Thanks!",
