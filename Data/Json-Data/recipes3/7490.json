I don't really like spicy so I did not make the sauce. I did use the tomato and mayonnaise on the bread however. The seasoning for the fish was perfect; I added some salt as well. I don't think it would reheat well so it will remain a quick dinner or weekend lunch meal. I served it with vegetarian vegetable soup and pickle spears. Fresh fruit for dessert.",

Use olive oil or coconut oil to cook fish and low fat or fat free mayo and Low fat cheese. Tortillas can replace bread or crumble fish in your choice of greens and low-fat dressing for a delish salad. Ask community for suggestions to make dishes more \"heart\" friendly. We love to share.
