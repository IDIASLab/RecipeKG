However, as a Slovak who has grown up with this dish, I am quite surprised by your addition of baking powder and egg.  None of these exist in traditional halu\u0161ki, and if anything the egg will make these delicious potato pillows tougher.  Please please next time omit the eggs and baking powder, and you'll actually be eating a traditional dish.  P.S.  Mixing sheep milk feta with a bit of sour cream to mimic the traditional bryndza sheep cheese works quite well too.  Dobr\u00fa chut'!",

I did need a bit more flour than the recipe called for but it depends on the amount of moisture in the potatoes. I gauged it according to how the dough held together in the boiling water. I used Bryndza (sheep cheese) instead of Brick cheese because we can get it in Chicago and it is more authentic. Yummy!",
