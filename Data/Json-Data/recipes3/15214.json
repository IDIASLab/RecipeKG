Great for deep frying but not so great for oven baking. If your legs are really big I recommend either soaking them in salt water beforehand to rid them of excess blood or either parboiling them. If not you will end up with a not so appetizing outcome. I hate to even mention it but I feel I must. This recipe is fast and super simple and one definitely worth making. Tyson knows chicken and that makes me proud to live in Tyson capitol.",

This is obvious a base recipe and will need some seasoning. After removing chicken from oven place on wire rack never on paper towels.
