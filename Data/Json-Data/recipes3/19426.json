Made tails out of caramels as suggested by others with great results. A small knife to pierce the dough for the placement of ears, tail and eyes made assembly easy. Used pink pearl candies for eyes. Mice can be made a couple days ahead and kept in the fridge but caramel tails will get soft so do not add until day of the party. Tails can be made ahead as well but store alone. These are well worth the effort. For those unfamiliar with chocolate wafers Nabisco (R) makes Famous Chocolate Wafers. They come in a 9 oz yellow box with a cellophane wrapper.

We made a lab rat maze out of a computer paper box lid and strips of cardboard covered with foil--scotch tape held the strips in to make the maze walls (took about 10 minutes to make). We dripped fake blood on a note next the maze saying that these mice are for the taking and the the hammer (propped up against the maze) is the most effective way of killing them so you can eat them, unless you want to bite their heads off. We dressed as mad scientists. Recipe modification: instead of using licorice, make VERY realistic tails by rolling pieces of caramel into skinny tapering strips. Most of the comments we got at the party were about the caramel tails!",

I used the crushed oreos again to roll them on. For brown mice i rolled them in baking cocoa powder. I did try the confectioner's sugar for white mice but they didn't look right at all because the \"background\" is too dark. I made 4 tails out of one caramel candy by cutting in quarters and heating them in microwave for a few seconds. I attached the tails before rolling the chocolate bodies in the cookies/cocoa. I had to shove some of the tail inside the body so they would stay attached. I made 18 mice out of this recipe Update Made them again and they were much easier the second time around. Try not to handle the \"dough\" too much the heat of your hands will melt them and make them harder to handle. I used crushed teddy grahams for tan/beige colored mice.",

(they didn't look the best but i thought they tasted the best; nice counterbalance to the strong chocolate taste). anyway awesome! thanks for another great halloween idea.
