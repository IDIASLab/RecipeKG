For two ears of corn I cooked in the microwave for 8 minutes on High. I added butter and sea salt. Delicious - perfect for two people!",

You can use what ever, soft rolls work nicely too, main thing is the bread is fresh and soft.  We spread the butter on a slice of the bread and once the corn is clean we wrap the bread around the hot corn and softly coat the corn w/the butter from the bread.  While we let the corn cool for a minute or so we eat the bread w/the melted butter on it.  It is some kinda good!  The fresh bread is slightly heated from the corn and it has the salt  on it...fabulous!  My favorite is to use Jane's Crazy Salt.",
