I used half of the cabbage leaves for stuffed cabbage. I shredded the remaining half of the cabbage and used it in this recipe. I used margarine rather than vegetable oil to saute the onions and cabbage. Finally, I mixed in 8 ounces of cooked noodles into the cabbage and onions and added a little more margarine. I served this to my mother-in-law, who, due to infirmities, hasn't been able to make this dish in over 12 years. My mother-in-law agreed that it was identical to the classical slovak version of cabbage and noodles. The final test was serving this to my wife (who hates cabbage and noodles) and she devoured it and said I could make it again. This is a great recipes. Thanks for posting it.",
