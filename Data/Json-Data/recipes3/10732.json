We used Jiffy cornbread mix and found the sweetness of the mixture was a little bit of an odd combination with the rest of the flavors in the dish - so I would just use one without so much sugar in the mix next time I think.",

I use turkey meat (bc I dont eat beef) I cook the turkey with the onion and add garlic, paprika, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and cumin. I just throw them all In and measure by smell. Once the turkey has browned I throw in the beans and drained tomatoes and cook on high for about 10 minutes to marry flavors and cook down the juices. Once it's done I put a thick layer of cheddar on the meat mix before I spread my cornbread. I use gluten free corn bread because of an allergy that said this works with home made corn bread too (you're basically just omitting the milk and butter and using creamed corn in their place) I top my corn bread with a little cheddar and cook. So good! And super easy. This has replaced taco night in our house because its actually easier and far less messy.",

This speeds things up and insures the corn bread isn't soggy on the bottom. Also, for those of you that don't care for sweet cornbread, buy or make an unsweetend cornbread mix.
