I did not have garlic and herb just plain garlic so I used some Herbes de Provence to season the chicken and lowered the minced garlic to 1 clove as my child might have turned her nose up at too much garlic. These crepes were creamy and smooth very tasty. I may try adding some precooked spinach to the filling to make it more interesting but as they are these were delicious. Oh I did not sprinkle the parsley I just saw that:) I served them with a Mediterranean salad (lettuce tomato a little red pepper and cucumber) and a balsamic vinaigrette. Good combination.",

I did not use rotisserie chicken, but boiled and shredded some chicken tenderloins I had in the freezer. My cream cheese was a different flavor from what the recipe calls for (still an herb blend) and I didn't have fresh parsley but the thyme had great flavor. I popped one batch in the refrigerator to bake later (approximately 20+ minutes to heat through). Excellent recipe that I will definitely make again.",

I adjusted the recipe for 5 servings (1 egg) and had a perfect amount of batter for 4 crepes, which is what I wanted.  Each crepe took about 3 TBS. of batter in my crepe pan.  Once the pan was hot each one cooked in less than 2 minutes.\n\nChose savory chicken filling today.  Will make these crepes again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.  Probably do them again tonight to fill with the rest of my strawberries and whipped cream.",
