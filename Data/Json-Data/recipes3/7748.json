I use almond milk in place of a the cream, and chipotle seasoning powder in place of the adobo. I also like mine very spicy, so I add lots of cayenne and fresh ground black pepper. The perfect topping for this is a TBSP sour cream (I use fat-free) or a dollop of goat cheese. I eat this several times a week in the winter; with the above modifications, it's actually a very low-calorie soup.",

Evaporated milk can be subbed for the cream if you want to lighten it up (and next time may use chicken stock).  Yummy recipe!  Thank you, Chris!",

If you want to add more smoky pepper flavor but don't want the heat of extra chipotles, smoked paprika is a nice choice rather than regular paprika. I made this as directed, subbing chicken broth, the smoked paprika, and slightly less half-and-half. We garnished it with cilantro and avocado, which was a great contrast to the heat and spice. Thanks for the recipe - I'm looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow! :)",

I ended up only using 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 because the roux and the pumpkin were already creamy and thick. And frankly the extra cream would've made it just a bit more bland. The spice is nice the flavors good just needs a little oomph. Maybe some good maple syrup to round out the flavors? I'm not sure. Also I'm not super familiar with canned chipotles in adobo but mine still had the seeds which I put in the soup which are a bit disconcerting when they end up in your mouth. Should I have seeded them? Would've been a mess. Great start though and still very good as is. Thanks!",
