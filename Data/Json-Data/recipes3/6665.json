Changes: I did not soak the squid as I am lactose-intolerant. I was going to hammer them to tenderize but ended up without enough time and it was not a problem at all. The squid were delicious. It was a lot of food for us (I divided the recipe in 3 to serve 2 people). We ended up eating it all anyway because it was so delicious but probably ate too much. I would probably use less sea bass next time. The fish store told me it should be Chilean Sea Bass which was super-pricey. I did do that but it was a tender rich fish and I could have used a different fish I think. I would use less fish then but I would make more sauce as the sauce was fantastic.",
