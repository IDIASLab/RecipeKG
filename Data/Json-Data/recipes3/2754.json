                "reviewBody": "We love this one!!!  Tastes great but admittedly, I kicked it up a bit by adding some Cajun seasoning and using chipotle seasoning instead of cayenne.  I cooked this dish on the stove instead of the microwave (it scares me to microwave shrimp for 10 minutes!!) At any rate, I have a few tips to conserve money and ingredients.  I don't use a lot of celery so I bought what I needed from a salad bar in the market (.37 cents versus $1.50 for a bunch of celery that will wind up in the garbage anyways).  Also, I use a toothpaste type squeeze thing of tomato paste (Amore Brand - supposedly the best) that's available usually at a supermarket near the other Italian sauces aisle.  I use Thai rice as I prefer the taste (Nishan Brand, Jasmine that comes in a 4 lb sack and cooks up nicely if you follow the directions and is just about the right amount for this dish - 1 cup rice, 2 cups water, 1Tbsp butter). The cooking times remained about the same - seems like a bit too long for the shrimp but keep in mind that the addition of the soup cools the other stuff down so 10 more minutes of cooking still left the shrimp tender.  We loved this so much we made it two nights in a row.  The first night we had shrimp and large sea scallops (1Lb total) and the second we had it with shrimp, large sea scallops, and swordfish cut into bite-size pieces and substituted Cream of Shrimp.  We both thought it was somewhat better with Cream of Chicken - also, used butter and not margarine.",

It's important to note that yes, this can obviously be cooked on the stovetop easily and that you can totally play around with the amounts and kinds of seasonings. At home I make this spicier and for a different group I'll make it with less of a kick.  \n\nI love it that people are taking this starter recipe and twisting it to their unique tastes!  I've made this recipe using shrimp, crawfish, chicken, crab and fish.  I've used margarine or butter, depending on what I had more of in the fridge.  It all depends on what you are in the mood for.  \n\n*In recent years I have decreased the amount of time I cook the shrimp in the microwave.  I've been adding it last so that it doesn't overcook. Remember, a \"c\" shape is done but an \"o\" is overcooked.*",

To the seasonings, I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, a bay leaf, some cajun seasoning (to taste), and to thin it out a bit at the end I added some white wine, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup or so.

I microwaved it for less than the recipe called for.  I think I did the veggies for 7 minutes.  Next time I'll try 6 minutes. I used defrosted cooked frozen shrimp so I cooked it for a shorter time when I added the shrimp so they wouldn't become rubbery.
