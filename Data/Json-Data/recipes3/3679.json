I also only used 1 can of tomato sauce and omitted the tomato paste. My husband is vary wary of anything called a \"casserole\" but he liked it too. He even asked for the recipe to take to the fire station this morning and cook for the guys because it was tasty and economical. Thanks for a great recipe!",
