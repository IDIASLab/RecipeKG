Additionally cooking them over medium-low heat was pointless. We think that if they were seered over very high heat or perhaps cooked on a grill they would have been much better.",

It turned out great! I accompanied this pleasant side-dish with Dijon mashed potatoes pork in mushroom Dijon sauce and Cajun deviled eggs which contain lots of Dijon. Great combination! Great meal!",
