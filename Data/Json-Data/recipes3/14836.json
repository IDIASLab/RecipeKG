I poked the chicken with fork put every thing into a ziploc bag and let it marinate overnight (which I highly suggest). I grilled it with a fresh sprig of rosemary and WOW -it came out so moist juicy and full of the delicate flavor from the fresh herbs. It's a definite keeper. I served this with a side dish of \"Bow Tie Pasta with Broccoli Garlic and Lemon\" from this site. Thanks for a great recipe JustDMarine!",
