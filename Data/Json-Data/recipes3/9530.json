I couldn't find my dry mustard anywhere so I used a 1/2 tsp prepared mustard and I found out I was out of garlic salt which was an omen because it was PLENTY salty enough (I just added a 1/4 tsp of plain garlic powder instead). The cucumber was definitely detectable and I used a small one. This was very creamy so I'm thinking I could have added more pasta since we were eating right away or it would be a good make ahead salad as I don't think it would dry out too much over night. Anyway I think it's a nice change from the traditional salads of this sort that use Italian-style dressing and since I've never used a sour cream/mayo base in a pasta salad before I must admit I was pleasantly surprised how well they work together. I would suggest adding some chopped tomato and crumbled bacon though to make it five stars:)...that's what I ended up doing and it was delicious!",
