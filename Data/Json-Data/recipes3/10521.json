I followed it as described in the recipe except I took the suggestion someone made and grilled it under the broiler before breading the eggplant slices. It seemed a better idea to do it that way. Other than that one change I did just what Heather suggested. I'm not a vegetarian so with the left over panko beaten eggs marinara sauce and some boneless chicken thighs I made some Chicken Parmesan to go with the eggplant. I breaded the chicken thighs and sauteed them in some olive oil 3 minutes on each side. Then placed them in the marinara sauce that was left over in the other saute pan and put the saute pan in the oven with the eggplant when there was 15 minutes left to cook. Can't wait until tomorrow to finish the leftovers.",

I confess to making a few minor changes: I lowered the temp to 350 and baked about 30 min before the \"stack\" step and instead of cooking spray drizzled olive oil over the slices. And instead of stacking I spooned warmed-up sauce and cheese on each eggplant round and then broiled for a few minutes. Just a personal preference to the stacking. BTW I used the no-tomato sauce recipe here for the marinara. Overall: YUM!",

And so I used just one cup of regular Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added another cup of grated parmesan cheese. Also added a bit more spice t the mixture with additioal Italian seasining salt and pepper. My egg plants were small and this was enough to cover them. They baked up beautifully in the oven and were pretty much done even prior to the final stacking and baking. I ended up making my own very quick basic sauce with crushed tomatoes tomatoe saue olive oil garlic and spices. I am definitely making this again!!",
