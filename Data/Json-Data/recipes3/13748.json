I have the tendency to be gravy challenged but this turned out perfect for me. It was a little thinner than most but that is how I prefer it. I wasn't sure about the canned mushrooms but I was very pleased with the outcome. Fresh parsley really makes a difference in this one. I will be making this again today so that I have some for all of the leftovers.",

I used 2 tbsp beef drippings from a meatloaf I made 2 cups of chicken tomato bullion broth the 1/4 cup flour a full cup of fresh sliced white mushrooms garlic powder a touch of rosemary and Italian seasoning and some salt and pepper. This was delicious. I mixed the flour with the drippings until it clumped over medium heat and then added the broth and mushrooms at the same time to soften them. I let it boil and thicken while adding the seasonings. This recipe is very versatile!",
