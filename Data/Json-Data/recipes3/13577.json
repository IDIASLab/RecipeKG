I think a 5-lb. chicken is more than 4 servings, but it was good enough that we all ate more than we should have. Very moist, the timing was about right, and the gravy tasted good. I did add a splash of white wine, and put extra herbs on the chicken, but followed instructions for everything else. You could add whatever vegetables you like, of course.",
