I made some w/1 slice of ham and some w/2 slices (my ham was thin and I thought 1 piece might tear when I try to lift them out after cookin'). Added shredded sharp cheddar cheese then the egg and sprinkled some scallions on top and then pepper. Let it cook for 15 min's (the eggs looked wobbly still) then cooked it for another 7 min's. They came out w/the ham edges a lil blackened at the very edge on some but the eggs were done perfectly for me not runny but not completely set either. Added some hot sauce and breakfast was served! I would def recommend making these and adding your own spin on ingredients to make them perfect for you. Next time I'm addin' jalapeno's.",
