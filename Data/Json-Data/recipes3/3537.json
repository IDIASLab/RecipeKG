A little tip, if you separate the garlic\ninto individual cloves, then put them into boiling water\nfor about 30 seconds, then put them into a bowl of\nice water, they are much easier to peel.

I am a great fan of anything pickled, and I am a great fan of garlic, but everything that I tasted in the \"pickled garlic\" world fell very short of my expectaions. I suppose the problem is that so many recipes call for sugar --- and that's just wrong! I mean sugar ... garlic ... ooooooooohh, no... But this is everything you want: a nice little zing with the cayenne, fresh dill. It's a lovely appetizer, and I can't think how many rave reviews I've had.

Turned out absolutely beautiful (for the Fair) and the guests at the Beast Feast really chowed down on the ones I served them.
