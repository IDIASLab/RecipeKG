I dump all of the ingredients in a crock pot in the morning, turn it to medium and it's ready by lunch.  The only thing I do differently is to whisk about 1 1/2 cups flour into the chicken broth.  This gives it a little thicker consistency. I also use dried onions instead of fresh and a large can of chicken (saves alot of time!).  Try it, it will be one of your favorites!",

I also substituted a can of rotel for the salsa as suggested by another reviewer. I don't like creamed corn, so I used frozen corn instead. I garnished with the cheese, cilantro, sour cream, chips and diced avocado. Served with warmed, buttered flour tortillas. Yummy! Thank you for the recipe!",

I left out the cilantro & onion because my fresh salsa contained both and they're not my favorites. I'm a real wimp when it comes to spicy foods, and was so happy that this soup is full of wonderful flavor - but not HOT at all. Don't be afraid to try this! If you like spicy it's easy to adjust using a hotter salsa. I also recommend the Portuagese Fried Bread on this web-site to go with this soup.",
