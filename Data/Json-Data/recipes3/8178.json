I used only 2 lbs. of turkey and 1/2 lb. of mushrooms but even so the liquid measurements all need to be at least doubled. Use 12 TBSP of butter to avoid the flour gumming up and if you don't want the turkey to overwhelm the sauce use at least 4 cups of soy milk and 2-3 cups of checken broth. I discovered that the hard way after scalding my sauce pan (which should be at least a 6-qt size). Finally bake at 350 not 450 for about 45 minutes. It came out reasonably well and I'll make it again but please be sure to use enough liquid!",
