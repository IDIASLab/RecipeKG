Since I would be the only one eating this dish I cut the recipe in half and it made plenty and I had very small zucchinis. I had half for dinner last night and the other half for lunch today. The garbanzo beans and pesto added a lot of flavor to the zucchini. (I will be making hummus with the other 3/4 can of opened garbanzo beans). The trick is not to overcook the zucchini strands and stir as gently as possible. I love this dish and will be making it again. Served it with 'Lisa's Easy Chicken' from AR along with corn on the cob baked potato for DH and Italian bread with 'Basil Butter' from AR. Thanks Allie for sharing your recipe.",

Following suggestions from other reviews, I added some things and I prepared them in steps.  I saut\u00e9ed a small amount of thinly sliced red onion in olive oil and set aside. Then I saut\u00e9ed mini Heirloom tomatoes (Trader Joe's), cut in half with a little olive oil and some garlic and S&P and set aside.  I mashed the garbanzo beans a bit and slowly heated them in the pan with homemade pesto so as not to get too hot.  Then, I saut\u00e9ed the zucchini spirals in a separate pan in a little olive oil until just wilted.  I constantly tossed the zucchini while cooking so as not to get overdone.  (I always cook  my zucchini spirals separately from the recipe so it does not get mushy).  I added everything together and did a quick toss.  Topped with crushed red pepper flakes and grated gouda/parmesan cheese.   The only problem was there were no leftovers!   Next time I would double the recipe so we had leftovers.  It's a keeper!",
