If you make it 5 mins before you need it of course it's not going to have much flavor. I tasted this about 4 hours after I made it and it was very flavorful. The next day it was delicious! I like the combo of the herbs used and the versatility to substitute or add others. I made it exactly as written and I made a half recipe. I love that unlike envelope dip mixes this isn't loaded with sodium and other preservatives. Plus it's healthy! I used non-fat Greek yogurt and it was nice and thick. The only suggestion I would make it to cut back a bit on the fresh garlic because once the dip sits for a while it gets very garlicky!",
