Also I didn't need two packages - one was probably enough. 2) Use a rolling pin to flatten the bread after you remove the crusts but before you cut it. It will roll up much easier! 3) If you flatten the bread you can cut each slice of bacon into thirds. Don't be afraid to \"stretch\" the bacon out before you wrap it. 4) If you are looking to cut your costs or calories even further you can cut each slice of bacon in half lengthwise before you cut it in thirds.",

They were gone before I could get everything on the table with several attendees wanting the recipe. I then made them as a snack treat/appetizer for Thanksgiving. Again a BIG hit! My 9-year old nephew asked for more when they were gone and asked that I make him is very own bag to take home with him when he left that upcoming Saturday. My other nephew's friend who was in attendance asked for the recipe to take home to his mother. Now...my friends have requested this to be made for 2 separate Christmas parties I will be attending during the month of December. Sooo...I would highly recommend this to anyone. Note: While making my nephew's \"personal\" order the day after Thanksgiving I was unable to find the Pepperidge Farm Sandwich Bread because my grocery store was out of it due to the holiday. That bread makes a definite difference...a must! Also I spread the cream cheese spread on the bread slices BEFORE cutting the pieces of bread into 3 separate sections. This just saved some time and made the process a little easier. Thanks for an awesome most unique appetizer!:)",
