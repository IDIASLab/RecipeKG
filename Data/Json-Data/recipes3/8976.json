The best tip that I got was cold cold cold. I made the batter the night before and refrigerated the shrimp in coconut milk (I don't think that added anything). I coated the shrimp and rolled them in unsweetened coconut (Bob's Redmill) and refrigerated them for 6 hours. The next tip is to have your oil the proper temperature. If the oil is not hot enough (357 degrees F) or your shrimp/batter not cold the coating WILL fall off. A lot of people mentioned using smaller shrimp. It seems to me that if you want to get that perfect golden brown color it takes 3-4 min and a small shrimp will be mush. I don't know for sure but I used colossal shrimp and they were PERFECT. I also used as did many the wonderful recipe for the orange marmalade sauce. I did have one guest say that she would have preferred the sauce without the honey. Everyone else loved it and I can recommend it with or without the honey. I did use a deep fryer but with the cost of avocado oil the level was not very deep. What IS great about the fryer is the ability to control the temperature. When it says 375 it IS 375. I have a smaller fryer and only did 4-5 shrimp at a time in about 3\" of oil. They were not at all greasy and the paper towels had very little oil on them. This recipe is a bit time consuming but you can do everything",
