I let it chill for about 45 minutes and it was so good that's all I ate for dinner. I would suggest using avocados that are slightly green so they are not too soft when you are mixing. Also only make enough for what will be eaten at that meal. The avocado's naturally start to brown when cut and the salad is not visually appealing the next day! Good lord this tasted delicious!!
