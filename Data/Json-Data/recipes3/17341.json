At first when I put it all together I tasted it and didn't think it was all that special but after I got there and stirred in the nuts and the parmesan cheese and the dressing flavors had had time to blend it was actually really delicious. I agree with someone else that said it is very expensive to make so I did substitute the pine nuts for slivered almonds but even still everything else added up too. It does make a lot though and I think you could substitute the priscioutto for a less expensive meat as well but I wouldn't leave it out completely it does add some extra flavor and texture to have some kind of meat in there. Overall we loved it!!",
