Before cooking the chicken I shook on some garlic powder Italian seasonining and Spike spice blend. I sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms and diced onions with a crushed clove of garlic. Two crushed cloves in the ricotta sauce and voila - lots of flavor! I left out the broccoli b/c I didn't have any but will add that next time. DH says it's the best pizza I've made AND that it was better than our go-to pizza place. High praise - thank you so much!",
