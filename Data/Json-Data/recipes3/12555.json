Heat on my gas ranger was midway between med and lo, not so hot that the oil smoked. Make the cakes small, not one huge pancake in the skillet, wait for the little bubbles to form before flipping. I made a nice big stack for the week, they are sturdy enough to go into the toaster.  This recipe could be altered to be savory with spices and made a paleo bread side dish!",

I used almond extract for vanilla and almond milk for almond coconut. the pancakes were quite different in texture. They were little dry. Also grainy but that could've been my fault I used Almond meal which is coarser than four. But I loved the almond flavor and didn't mind the low carb version of pancakes. Unfortunately the children didn't like them. And FYI this recipe only made 7 pancakes.",
