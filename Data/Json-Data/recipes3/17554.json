Add as much or as little oil as you'd like, or omit completely if you prefer. Use different fresh or dried peppers to infuse the oil. This reheats exceptionally well; in fact, I find it more flavorful the next day. Serve with wheat crackers or pita chips. Instead of parsley, you can top with crushed pistachios or pumpkin seeds.",
