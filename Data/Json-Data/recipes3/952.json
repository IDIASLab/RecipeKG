Leftovers are also good. :-) Crust: I bought a package of two frozen deep dish pie crusts. I left one in the foil \"pan\" and took the other one out of its container (after letting it thaw a bit). I poured all the ingredients in the one I left in the pan, then I kind of flattened the other crust and tore it as needed to cover the top. I crimped and cut slits as suggested. EDIT: I've since made this recipe again, and I now use the Walmart brand or Pillsbury brand refrigerated dough that's by the canned biscuits and cinnamon rolls. Chicken: I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts. I used a skillet and boiled the chicken in water with 1 chicken bouillion cube, turning as needed to cook both sides. EDIT: I've also used leftover grilled chicken, which was equally as good.",

I also used frozen veggies - carrots, peas & corn - instead of canned (I just boiled them for a minute in the chicken stock leftover from cooking the chicken).

I made a ton of tweaks, so many that I'm not sure if what I made is really the same recipe anymore.  I heated two cans of soup (cream of chicken and cream of chicken with herbs) thinned with some milk and stock and made an additional sauce with 1/3 cup butter, 1/3 cup flour (whisked together and cooked for 2 minutes), 1 and 3/4 cup chicken stock, 3/4 cup milk, salt, pepper, celery seed and fresh thyme.  I wanted to be sure I had tons of gravy.  Once I mixed all that together I reserved a third of it to top the pie and mashed potatoes with.  I cook up a chopped onion, 3 ribs of celery and 3 shredded carrots in some butter. I then sliced up a roast chicken and boiled and chopped up 2 potatoes. I threw all that in along with a can of peas.  Now I had enough for two pies.  I put 1/2 the filling in the freezer for next time.  Used 2 deep dish ready made crusts.  One I poked holes in and flashed baked for 10 minutes at 350 and the other I used to top it all, giving it an egg wash and cutting some holes in the top.  Cooked at 350 until golden.",
