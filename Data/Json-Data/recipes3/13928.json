I added some fresh broccoli florets and before baking topped it all with sliced sweet Italian chicken sausage.  Before the last 5 minutes of baking, I sprinkled on some parmesan cheese.",

This also plates nicely and has an elegant look to it making it perfect to serve to company yet simple enough to make for your every day average meal.",

I didn't have limes or cilantro (unfortunately) so instead, I put the Cauli, Beans, Cherry Tomatoes & also some halved Brussels Sprouts into a large bowl. I tossed them with some olive oil, dry white wine, balsamic Vinegar, Sea Salt, Pepper, Rosemary and minced garlic. This turned out so delicious and the outside of the brussels were caramelized. I drizzled some more balsamic over the top when it came out of the oven and a bit more rosemary. I will definitely be making this again!",
