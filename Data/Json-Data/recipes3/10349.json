I purchased a few pounds of lobster tails (7-8) 6-8 oz size which were about 5.99 a piece. I cooked with with an inexpensive brut champagne that I love. It was a big hit and extremely easy. The cook time for the tails was accurate as I left the meat in the shell as they cooked. I used half and half which makes a sauce which isn't as thick. I served them with crab cakes steamed broccoli and a salad.",
