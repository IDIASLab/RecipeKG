I mixed it more than I should've because I had to add salt to add flavor the tomatoes took away! The end result looked like split pea soup. I will try again next time I'll modify and keep it as guacamole.",

I only use fresh tomatoes but this last time I used the fresh tiny cherry tomatoes and cut them in half(the colour really popped from them). I also add a big bunch of chopped cilantro and only one jalapeno for the peppers. Make sure that you do not buy over ripe mushy avocados for this recipe or you will have a sloppy mess. For best results add the slightly tender avocado's last and gently toss them only a few times so they don't make a sloppy mess. Chill and enjoy.:)It is always a hit at the parties.",
