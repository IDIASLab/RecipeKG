I really dislike the taste of celery but decided to try it and it was suprisingly phenomenal for a celery recipe. However I did substitute a couple things that really improved and masked the celery taste. I used shitake mushrooms instead of regular ones and added red peppers instead of green peppers. I also omitted the butter to make it lower in calories and fat! The flour milk and cheese make this side dish creamy. And the thick bread cumb layer really adds something. Give it a whirl you won't be disappointed!",

I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed all the veggies with the celery. I also cut the recipe in half since there were only two of us for dinner. Thank you for a recipe with a \"real\" sauce and not a sauce made from canned soup. Much better fresher flavor. I think I might try using this recipe as a sauce for a green bean casserole.",

Did 50/50 butter and canola oil for cooking the veggies and made the roux with almond milk. It turned out amazeing. Very flavorful and fresh tasteing. Thanks for a keeper.",
