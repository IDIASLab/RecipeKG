I just ate it as a soup and didn't even bother with the rice. Great flavor all across the board. The one thing I would change and recommend is to not add the shrimp so soon. It got overcooked and a little rubbery. The next time I make this I will toss it in the last 10 minutes. Thanks for sharing!",
