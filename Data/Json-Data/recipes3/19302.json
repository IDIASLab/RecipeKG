With my modifications however I'd call this 4 stars--much better. I dredged the chicken in flour seasoned with Montreal Chicken Seasoning before browning but added no flour to the sauce as I knew it wouldn't be necessary. After removing the chicken from the pan I sauteed shallots and minced garlic before adding the broth half and half some white wine and the Dijon. As the sauce reduced I added some chopped fresh tarragon for added dimension and flavor which really worked nicely. I admit the end result was probably a different dish albeit a better one.",

As a chef, if you really want to make this a stand out dish, then leave out the flour, use heavy cream (although if you're cutting fat, you can get away with fat free half and half, but it's not as impressive), add stone ground mustard (gives it some oopmh in texture and flavor) and tarragon to taste.  Serve it with some type of potato (Duchesse or croquettes are perfect) and a delicate green veg like asparagus.  Preparing the dish this way is not only easier, but these small changes make it a truly French dish that's wonderful in both taste and appearance.  You can also switch it around a bit and use beef tenderloin!",

Once the chicken was sauteed, I merely set it aside and made the sauce. Once the sauce was done, I put the chicken back into the sauce pan and let it simmer. I did, of course add, onion and garlic powders along with black pepper and fresh rosemary. Great Janet and thanks so much for a fantastic recipe that my family loved!",

I cooked as directed though my oven would not go that low. It's great to prepare this meal in advance and then pop it in the oven at a higher temp for the recommended time when your ready to eat.
