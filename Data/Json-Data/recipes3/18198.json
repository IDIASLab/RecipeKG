I added more spices and a whole bag of spinach, fresh peppers and some black olives to boost the flavour. Mine took the full 50 minutes, but I cooked it in a partially cooked pie crust. If I try it crustless next time I think I\u2019ll pre-steam and drain the spinach first, as it was quite runny, but that\u2019s probably because the cottage cheese is so watery nowadays.",

I used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano and added some salt and pepper. Very good and I will definitely make this again.",
