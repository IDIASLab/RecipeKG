The trick to getting the cream cheese and oil to mix is to do it in a food processor. Add the cream cheese and herbs and start pulsing, then very slowly add in the oil while pulsing the machine. If you do it right, the oil and cream cheese will form an emulsion and will not separate. I will make it again, but next time I think I will add feta cheese and garlic salt, it was just missing that extra punch of flavor.",

Since my bread slices were small it only took a few minutes on low to melt.  I also drizzled a small amount of olive oil and grated parmesan after coming out of the oven. ",

It was impossible to get the mixture \"smooth\" - even using the electic mixer once you stop mixing it immediately begins to separate. Not sure if there's anything to be done about that. Anyway that being said it still tasted delicious and was an excellent accompaniment to our spaghetti dinner.",
