I used a 6 oz. bag of baby spinach that I washed & chopped & also used whole wheat penne.  I sauteed the garlic for just a little while 1st.  I added salt & pepper & also added 1/2 a pound of defrosted shrimp, just to warm it up, before adding the pasta & feta cheese (I happened to have plain feta in the frig).  If you keep stirring the mixture at the end, the feta melts & the sauce gets an orangy, creamy texture.  I also put red pepper flakes on the table, if someone wanted even more zip.  I'll try 3/4 of a cup of feta next time as my husband thought the feta had a strong taste, although I loved it & we finished the whole dish.",
