                "reviewBody": "This is a pretty darn good meal. And easy too! The biggest issue I had though was the cook time. Mine took at least an extra 20 minutes for the potatoes to be fully cooked--and watch them closely as they brown on the outside but won't be fully cooked on the inside. I also threw in a couple chopped carrots because why not? For next time I would also either reduce the amount of chicken broth or up the overall honey-mustard amount. I found the honey-mustard flavor to be a tad watered down with that much broth. That's just my personal preference though. I also had a green onion that needed to be used so I threw that in at the end. Oh and I used bone-in skin-on chicken thighs. The recipe didn't specify the chicken thighs used so that's what I went with. Overall a very good recipe! Thank you!",

I don\u2019t like dark meat, so I quartered chicken breasts instead. I still baked it at 400, but only baked it for 40 minutes and the chicken was perfect. Instead of putting the potatoes in the oven raw, I steamed them in the microwave for 6 minutes and then added them to the meat marinade. Someone else suggested using less chicken stock and I agree, perhaps by half.",
