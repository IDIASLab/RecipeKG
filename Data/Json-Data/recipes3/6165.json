So..I did have basil and oregano and I threw in mozzarella parmesan and the end of a carton of cottage cheese. The results were very good and I will make this again. Might try rosemary and gouda instead of the spices and cheeses listed. It's a good last minute bread for soup or salad using ingredients that you would have on hand.",

The cheese gave it a lovely taste (and pretty orange tinge). The only thing I would leave out is the cayenne pepper, it sorta overpowered the other flavors and left my mouth hot for quite some time. BUT, I am not a spice fan, so I'm sure you spicy-food-lovers will love the recipe with the pepper in it. Thanks a lot! ~Bae",
