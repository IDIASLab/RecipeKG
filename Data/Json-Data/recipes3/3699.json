I cooked and crumbled about 1/2 a pound of bacon and added it along with the spinach and cheese and onion. I cooked the onion first as a personal preference, I don't care for the sharpness of uncooked onion. I think this is amazingly delicious! There was a lot of butter sizzling on the top of the batter and around the edges as it cooked and the top looks a little greasy after it is done, so the butter could probably be reduced. The texture is light, almost quiche-like, but not too eggy. Very hard to describe, it tastes delicious though! Make *SURE* you do not undercook this, if you do it will turn out unappetizingly soggy. Good warm or at room temperature. The recipe doesn't say anything about draining the spinach after it is cooked, but I assumed it should be so I squeezed the cooked spinach till no more liquid ran out (do the same with thawed if you use frozen spinach).

It would get five stars with the following tweaks: Two bags of spinach, cooked in the microwave & drained. Use half the butter. Saute the onion.  Add garlic and Italian Seasoning. Use mixed Italian cheese and put parmesan on the top. Bacon was a good addition, but not essential. I think this will be great for potlucks and \"grab & go\" breakfasts. It was hard to stop eating them!  I like the name, because I probably wouldn't have noticed the recipe otherwise, and it's a real keeper!",

I took this to a holiday potluck last week and it was a hit, couldn't find any leftovers!\r\n\r\nI did made the following changes to the original recipe, however, based on previous user reviews and whatever cooking sense I may have!\r\n\r\nDirection changes: \r\na) I saut\u00e9ed the one chopped onion (about 8.5 oz) along with some fresh minced garlic in butter, until onion was translucent, before adding to the \u201cbrownie batter\u201d \r\nb) I used frozen spinach which I just cooked according to the package directions in the microwave (instead of watching a pot and dirtying another pan to prep spinach)\r\nc) I added in chopped roasted red peppers for a kick, and to add some red to the green since this was for a holiday gathering\r\n\r\nIngredient changes: \r\na) Instead of a half cup of butter, I used 2tbsp in which to saut\u00e9 the onions and chopped garlic, and an additional 2.5 tbsp of butter when making the batter -- the remaining half tbsp of butter greased the pan \r\nb) added 2 tsp fresh minced garlic as mentioned above \r\nc) added 1/8 tsp fresh ground black pepper\r\nd) replaced 8 oz mozzarella cheese with 4 oz mozzarella cheese plus 4 oz Mexican cheese blend (Monterey jack, QQ, Asadero blend)\r\ne) Added roasted red peppers (one, 2.5 oz piece) as mentioned above\r\n",

For those looking to cut back on calories and/or fat - there are simple alterations you can make.  \n\nReduced the butter to 1/4 cup (used 1 T. to saut\u00e9 the onion and the remaining 3 T were melted for the 'batter').  \n\nAs other reviewers have done - I would strongly suggest saut\u00e9ing the onion, add a little minced garlic - then wilt the spinach with the onion mixture.  I used 1 1/2 pounds fresh spinach...  \n\nI also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour... this was a great way to incorporate whole grains in the dish. \n\nI also suggest adding about 1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper and an extra 1/4 tsp salt (or a generous teasponful).  \n\nI didn't drain the excess liquid from the spinach mixture (the onion and spinach both release liquid, but not a significant amount) - and if you opt to use whole wheat flour - it typically needs a bit more liquid.  \n\nI only had whole milk on hand, but I believe 1 or 2% would work well too (I wouldn't recommend fat-free milk, but you can give it a try).  \n\nBaked for about 35-40 minutes.  Yieled 20 servings (roughly 2x2 inch squares)\n\nVery tasty!!!\n\nWW users: 2 points per seving (based on 20 servings) IF: you use 1/4 cup butter, whole milk, and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour",

I also add italian herbs, garlic, and typically either chopped red peppers, olives, or both.  I cut the total amount of butter to about 4 tbs, use 2tbs to saute the onion, red pepper, and/or olive & throw the spinach in with the onion until wilted instead of boiling it.
