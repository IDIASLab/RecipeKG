We don't eat wings very often (and never at home) so I just made the marinade (subbing out the sundried tomatoes for 1 tbsp ketchup) and added the garlic powder and chili powder to the marinade on the stove. I also left out the cornstarch (didn't have it). Then I used it to marinate chicken breasts and steak and holy cow! Tons of flavour! I went out and bought sesame oil and white wine for this recipe and I'm so glad I did. Thanks a million!",

I followed the recipe just as it was except i used left over Reisling for the white wine. I did add a few oz. more because i thought my tomoatoe part came out too pasty. We also use Habenero sauce. That wasn't bad. I DISLIKE spicy and he LOVES it and found it was tolerable. Loved it on the grill. This is a recipe for \"special\" friends and would have to make another 5lbs for two more people.",
