If you were to add an egg, you'd definitely need to add breadcrumbs or it would be too wet to form a patty. They held together perfectly without the egg too. I didn't get the idea until after the fact but next time I will leave the egg out of the mixture again and fry it up instead to put on top of the burger. Great recipe and one worth repeating.",
