The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that it absolutely needs a little fresh cracked sea salt fresh ground pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil to take it to the next level (which I added after I took the picture). I used low fat cottage cheese b/c I can't do the fat free and white basalmic vinegar instead of regular. I just eyeballed everything to taste. I could totally picture eating this w/ a few slices of toasted garlic crostini which I did not have today but will next time. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

Lots of tomatoes and too much balsamic vinegar.  I started eyeballing all the ing rather than measuring after I made this a few times- like 6 times in the last week!  I like it heavy on the tomatoes with just a splash or 2 of the vinegar.  Hubs even loves it!  I have added cut up red onion which was a nice addition.  Great way to use up all the fresh basil I have!",
