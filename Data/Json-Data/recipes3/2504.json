I cooked the pasta for 5 minutes before adding the veggies because I knew the pasta would never be done in 5 minuets. It worked out well that way. I also had to use blue cheese because both grocery stores by me are lame and had no gorgonzola. I will definitely make this again.",

I had some leftover from another recipe that called for melted gorgonzola so getting it in crumbled form the flavor was a bit overpowering. I'm not enough of a cheese snob to know of a good substitute (yet) The suggestions: refridgerate the asparagus and mix them in cold. The pop of cold with everything else cold provides a good contrast. Also mixed chives into the sauce which added a nice flavor. Will make again but not with the gorgonzola",
