The cottage cheese gives it a creamy moist texture without being overpowering. I do think it would work better to butterfly the breasts first or at least pound them to flatten them a bit so you can put more of the yummy filling in. I covered the breasts with whatever filling was left over and it was fantastic.",

I sauteed the spinach and onion with a dab of butter and garlic salt and pepper before adding to the cottage cheese. I also added about 2 tbsp of cream cheese to the mixture. I recommend pounding out the chicken before seasoning (I rubbed chicken with about 1 tbsp of cajun seasoning and 1 tbsp of MAGIC seasoning) because this makes it easy to roll the chicken up. I baked at 400 for about 30 min and added some mozzarella for the last 10 min.",
