Baked for about45 min to 1 hour. Was a big hit at Thanksgiving. Thanks.",

I did not have a turkey cavity (made breasts) so I dime store wrapped some heavy duty tinfoil and put the dressing inside. I also added about 1 extra cup of chicken broth to the stuffing because it was a little dry for my taste. I would give this recipe a 3 star rating but since I can t I gave it 4 stars.",
