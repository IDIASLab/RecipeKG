I used 2 packages of jello and used 3 cups of milk (basically because I ran out of milk) this made the pudding very thick when I added in the cream cheese (make sure it's nice and soft) and the whipped topping it made a nice mixture. However there was a lot of it! Couldn't get all the filling in the pie pan. Everyone commented on how rich the pie looked and they seemed to have re-named it \"rich fattening looking pie\"! It was a great hit thanks for sharing Debbie!",

To make a thicker pie filling I did cut back the milk by a half cup. I used a small box of instant chocolate fudge pudding instead of trying to guess measurements. Instead of chilling this pie in the fridge I froze it instead. The end result was very good my family enjoyed it. It's worth playing with the recipe for a quick pantry ingredient pie. NOTE: Don't try to mix the coffee into the pudding after it's firmed up. Dissolve the coffee in the milk BEFORE you make the pudding.",
