Since I'm living a low-carb lifestyle, I decided to adapt it, but the patties were less-than-desirable visually the taste wasn't that impressive. I had one completely fall apart on me in the pan so I just scrambled it up and viola; we had a new fave! You can add bacon and garlic as a yummy addition, if desired.",
