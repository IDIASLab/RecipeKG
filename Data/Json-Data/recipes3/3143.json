The only changes I made were: I didn't peel the potatoes but left the skins on and I cooked them for 3 min in the microwave before browning them. I cut out the olive oil completely and just sprayed my frying pan with Pam. And I added some diced onion. Maybe next time I'll try adding some ham or mushrooms and maybe a little onion powder/garlic powder to give it more flavor.",

I microwaved the potatoes first and added sauteed onions and a bit of cheese on top. I also added about a cup of broccoli to make it a complete meal (I feel a meal must have some veggie and potatoes are not veggies for me) and a couple more eggs. I gave it four stars because flipping via a plate seemed like a bad idea for me. I put in under the broiler for a few minutes to finish it. The cooked potatoes would have had a nice flavor on their own but adding onions just makes it that much more. The end result was gorgeous and delicious.",
