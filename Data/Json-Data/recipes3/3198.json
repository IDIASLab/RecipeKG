However, if you are like me and LOVE those flavors this recipe is a huge winner! My husband said it was just ok, but he prefers a richer type sauce with his pasta. The rest of the family loved this dish and I think the flavor combinations are perfect. Not too tangy, not too salty. I changed a few things only slightly. I used chopped kalamata olives and mixed it into the dish just before serving. I used 5 pieces of bacon and cooked them crisp and added them at the very end right before I added the olives. I sprinkled the chicken with Montreal Chicken seasoning then browned it in olive oil and not the bacon grease. I added about 1/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan and a sprinkling of fresh chopped Italian parsley just before serving.  After I drained the noodles, I tossed them with the sauce right in the sautee pan so the noodles really absorbed the flavor. A+ in my book, thanks for sharing!",

                "reviewBody": "Great blend of flavors, but the instructions don't seem too well thought out. Here's what I did:  1. Marinate chicken for an hour 2. Heat a large pot of water 3. In a large saucepan, add chicken, tomato, and rosemary, and simmer 20 minutes stirring occasionally (I also doubled the rosemary and added marjoram, paprika, and two cloves of crushed garlic) 4. After chicken has cooked for 10 minutes, turn up heat on large pot to bring water to a boil and add pasta 5. When chicken has cooked for 15 minutes, cook bacon (I used 4 slices and it didn't seem to be enough) and drain and crumble. 6. Set chicken on low and drain your pasta. 7. Add artichokes, olives, and bacon. Stir well and cook for about a minute. 8. Either plate the pasta and serve chicken on top or toss everything together and sprinkle feta on top.  My reasoning behind doing it this way is the bacon wouldn't stay crispy if simmered for 20 minutes after cooking, and the crunchiness adds a nice contrast in texture, and the same idea goes behind not cooking the feta, the coldness of it coming straight from the fridge contrasts the fact that the meal will be warm. I added some fresh grated Parmesan at the end, because I think pasta and Parm are synonymous.",
