We added green food coloring to the dough and when I took them out of the oven I added a single chocolate chip for a wart.  We also added red gel food coloring for the severed end of the finger.  The cookies do enlarge when baked (almost double the thickness) so make sure you don't make them to round when you are rolling them out.  The cookie flavor was good on top of looking great, thanks for a fun recipe.",

Also, I add the red gel frosting to the base of the fingers as if they've been pulled out of their socket - gross!  That way, you don't have to mess with the almonds.
