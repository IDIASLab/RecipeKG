A crisp peanut butter Rice Krispies&reg; treat surrounds a surprising candy 'yolk' center, while the sweetness is offset with an eggshell made up of dark chocolate. Of course, if you'd like the treats to look more egg-like you could cover them in white chocolate. You can also use your favorite Rice Krispies&reg; treat recipe in place of the one here.",
