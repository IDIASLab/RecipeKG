The cake browned very golden and inside was very soft light moist and pancake-like. If \"cobbler\" might be a misnomer think of it as something like an apple upside-down cake. The only change I'll make next time is the honey drizzled over the apples-- I'm not the biggest fan of honey so next time I'm going to replace the honey over the apples with maple syrup or date syrup.",
