You have to be careful with the chicken breast because if it overcooks it is dry regardless of how much liquid you cook with it. Making it again I would pound the breasts salt pepper and flour them and then cook them over high heat for a few minutes per side until done. Then I'd remove them from the heat and use the rest of the ingredients to make a sauce for topping the breasts. Cooking the breasts in the sauce was tricky: trying to get the apples cooked as well as the raisins and apricots soft without overcooking the chicken was more than I want to hassle with. But then I am pretty picky about overcooking chicken.",

I mixed the sauce ingredients separately before adding to the chicken. I pounded the breasts but only used 3 the 1.5 lbs package. Cut those in half after cooking which took about 30 minutes. I also used butter instead of oil. Very moist. Only thing i will do differently next time is egg and flour the chicken to give it a nice coating. Great with rice put some coconut on the rice too. I only rated this 4/5 because of the adjustments. I did not like the sauce before making the adjustments.",
