                "reviewBody": "If you've never roasted pumpkin seeds before here are my tips.  When you carve your pumpkins scoop the seeds into a colander and the guts onto newspaper.  Inevitably some of the guts will be mixed in with the seeds but when you run water over them it's separated out pretty easily.  After you drain the rinsed seeds, pour them onto a large, dry cookie sheet and let them sit for 24 hours or so to dry out. Now you can pick out the remaining pieces of pumpkin stuff that didn't get pulled out earlier and they will roast better if they are not wet when they go in the oven.  My family prefers them seasoned with garlic salt in place of regular salt but you can use whatever suits your taste.  So good!",

We had two cups of seeds so I upped the butter a bit and upped the salt even more - used garlic salt instead of Mortons.  I learned from others that it is VERY important to keep your single layer single in order to get the nice toasty seeds - and even then, ours took a longer than 45 minutes on two cookie sheets.  We just watched until they were toasty brown - and they are SO DELICIOUS!  Thanks and happy Halloween!",

I never boiled them as other users suggested. I only put them in a sink of water and cleaned them by swishing them around in the water and rubbing between my hands. This is NOT a complicated recipe so I suggest the 1st time you make these follow the recipe as written and the next time tweak as you like. Also for the ones that say you don't have salt on the inside....this is like salted sunflower seeds the salt is on the outside of the shell so you get the salt in your mouth as you crack open the seeds. PLEASE don't make this more difficult for people trying to make this for the 1st time as there are too many saying you HAVE to do this or that. If you are making this for the 1st time follow the recipe & remember these reviews are personal preferences and like I said you can \"tweak\" after you get the feel for this! :)",
