I added more veggies - steamed cauliflower with the broccoli sauteed mushrooms with the onions and added a diced roasted red pepper. I also added asiago cheese to the tofu mixture as well as sprinkling it on top. Since I don't really do pie crust (never comes out right and I don't like storebought) I did a crust with wholewheat couscous. It was easy and tasty(plus it has a lot less fat than pie crust). Mix cooked couscous (make sure it's pretty dry) with salt parsley or other herbs and a couple egg whites. Pat it into place like a graham-cracker crumb crust into an oiled or cooking-sprayed pie plate. Bake it for ten minutes at 350 before adding the quiche ingredients. Thanks for a fun flexible recipe. Can't wait to try other \"filling\" combinations.",

I used a homemade shortening-based pie crust. I'm glad to have this recipe in case it's needed for occassions such as this again. Doubt I'd make it for myself because I looooove quiche lorraine so much! I was worried when I made this that the filling was way too thick and almost added some more liquid but I'm glad I didn't.

One thing I will change next time (and that's because of personal taste) is to put red pepper to taste as opposed to 1/2 a teaspoon. I actually only used a 1/4 teaspoon and it was still to spicy for me. My co-worker whom I brought a piece to loved it too but she found that it could have used more red pepper. Go figure! Definitely think this should be \"red pepper to taste\" like the recipe calls for black pepper. Will definitely make this one again and serve it to my friends to see if they can tell it's made from tofu! Thanks for a great recipe.",
