Used cream of celery soup a package of no-name mac and cheese(plus some whole wheat bowties as it didn't seem like quite enough) pasta. I used the KD cheese instead of velveeta which I have never heard of. Like others suggested I used only 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs. It turned out really yummy. Reminds me of a cross between tuna casserole and corned beef hash. Mmm.. Good left alone or with some ketchup and pepper on it. Just as good leftover. Will totally make this again if I ever find myself with only with a can of soup some KD and a can of corned beef...:)",
