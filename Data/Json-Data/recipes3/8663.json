I made my own turkey sausage using ground turkey and spices and the milk I used was a mixture of 1% milk and fat free evaporated milk, which made it creamier. I did add some fresh ground pepper to the eggs. This turned out like a mix between a strata and a stuffed breakfast pizza. My family liked this but my husband thought it needed a little more inside the crescent rolls. Next time, I'll throw in some sauteed vegetables and maybe some spices. Good base recipe to make your own.",

I used half mild and half maple flavored Jimmy Dean sausage half mild & half Sharp cheddar cheese lemon pepper seasoning & a zesty season blend. The crust cooked fast and the middle of the casserole was slow to cook. I reduced the temperature to 300 and put the casserole on the lower rack to cook an additional 10 minutes. I still love this dish and plan to do it again but substitute condensed milk with 1 cup of milk instead of the 2 cups of milk.",
