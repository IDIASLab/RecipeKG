In the future when I have a piece of french bread left it will be turned into these tasty croutons. The italian bread at the store did not look great so I switched to a loaf of crusty french bread which proved to be the perfect choice. This salad has the perfect balance of salty sweet and tart. One might think that the combination of strawberries and tomatoes is odd (I did) but when paired with those toasted bread cubes salty feta cheese and a flavorful drizzle of olive oil honey and red wine vinegar WOW! To say we enjoyed this salad is putting it mildly. To say we LOVED it is accurate!",
