I always keep pinenuts in a sealed container in my freezer to add to the flavor of many recipes. I seasoned the hot beans in the strainer before adding them to the garlic and pinenuts. The green beans retained their color and looked lovely besides tasting wonderful. Thank you for a great recipe. Nancy",
