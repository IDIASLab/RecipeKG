Can't say that this tastes like a Creamsicle but it was good. At first it tasted a bit \"boozy\" to me but after the first few sips that wasn't an issue. I guess you get used to it. It's creamy and smooth and just a little orange-y. I think if I have this again I'd have Hubs do something to make it even orangier. He used regular half-and-half but beyond that stuck to the recipe as written - equal parts of all ingredients. He even liked it and he's strictly a classic gin martini kinda guy!",

If you can't find the fat-free version it's also just as good with regular half and half or cream just more calories. Also I would suggest this drink not be made in batches. The cream will separate a bit and make it less visually appealing after it's been sitting for awhile. Best to make them as you're drinking them even if you're serving more than one. Also you can double the orange juice for more of a cocktail and less of a martini if you want to go a little lighter on the alcohol. Lastly I almost always use Simply Orange or fresh squeezed orange juice for this recipe. It really does make a difference in the flavor vs. a reconstituted O.J. Hope you all enjoy this recipe as much as I have.:D",
