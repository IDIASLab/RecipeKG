This would be great to serve with Israeli-style couscous; alternatively, you could add some potato chunks to the pan halfway through the cooking.",

So i substituted the lemons for 2 tablespoons of  lemon juice; the prunes for 2 small plums and 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar. I added a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, and about a 1/4 cup of chopped parsley. I also added 1.5 tablespoons of rice vinegar to replace the wine. I cooked for 2 hours in a tagine(Dutch oven should be fine too). Results were delicious!!",
