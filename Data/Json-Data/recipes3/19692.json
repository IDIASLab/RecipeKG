I used a little over 2 lbs of lean ground beef cause that's what I had.  I used 1 cup of italian seasoned bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of sphagetti sauce instead of the ketchup.  I also used the diced tomatoes with garlic and onion.  This made 2 meat loaves for me.  The texture was perfect; moist but held together well and the flavor was amazing.  I served it with bowtie pasta tossed with parmesan and the rest of the jar of spaghetti sauce, garlic bread and steamed veggies.  This was an easy and delicious meal that my family loved!  Thanks for the great recipe.",

Use a non-stick meatloaf pan with a drainage insert so as to allow the grease from the hamburger and water from the toms to escape. Otherwise, it'll end up too moist to the point of falling apart. I baked mine for about 1:20, removing the foil and frosting the top with ketchup the last ten minutes. Served with egg noodles, buttered with parsley and Parmesan cheese, outstanding!",

I used italian-style bread crumbs, canned tomatoes with garlic & onion, chunky pasta sauce instead of ketchup and added 1tsp dried parsley and a pinch of crushed black pepper.  In addition, for the last 10 minutes of bake time I spread some pasta sauce atop the meatloaf and sprinkled it with grated parmesean.  Served with garlic-parmesean mashed redskins and green beans.

Instead of the diced tomato in the meatloaf I use a can of tomato soup with about 1/2 cup of water and spoon over the meatloaf when it's about 3/4 done. It makes the most delicous gravy! When doing this you need to form the loaf and cook it in a casserole dish that can accomodate the gravy around the loaf.",
