I didn t cook it quite long enough in the instant pot so had to finish it off in the oven which I think was the reason the pork wasn t as tender as I had hoped. I am still getting use to my instant pot. I will definitely try this again. I did make this again and have increased my rating to 5 stars. I used apple juice because I had it and we love the flavors. This time I trusted my Instant Pot and followed the directions and it was tender and delicious.",
