My husband and 3 year old thought this was great! And it heated up well for my lunch the bext day too!

But as far as taste, its overwhelmingly, and I mean overwhelmingly, tomatoes...and therefor VERY acidic even after cooking all night!  I was skeptical about using canned veggies b/c I always use fresh or frozen, but they were just fine.  The recipe has so much potential, I think if I tweek it a little bit, with less tomatoes, maybe a little wine, and some more beef, it would easily be 5 star.  I like the idea from another reviewer to add a little bit of cooked pasta shells at the end. Will try again.  \r\nPS-Get your bread maker going timed to finish at the same time and everyone will think you are superwoman...homeade soup and fresh hot bread!!!",

I was worried because of the reviews saying not to use frozen. I took into account the reviews saying there was too much of a tomato taste. Here's what I did, (and keep in mind it's mainly because I just used what I had on hand) 1 bag frozen mixed vegetables, I cut up 7 small red potatoes in very little pieces because they needed to be used, I also cut up one roma tomato for the same reason, 2 cans of beef broth to keep from getting the watered down taste from the frozen veggies, and 1 can of tomato soup. Everything else I did as directed. I added 1 can of broth first and then waited to see if I needed anymore liquid. About 4 hrs. in I added the second can and the soup to make it more soupy. Hope this helps someone that only has frozen vegetables on hand!",
