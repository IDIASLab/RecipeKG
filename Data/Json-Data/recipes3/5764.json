My biggest complaint is that when you pan fry these the sides remain uncooked if you make the patties the prescribed 1\" thick. They work great if you make them between 1/2\" to 1/4\" thick. The thick ones tended to have their crispy tops slide off. They were very tasty although for personal preference I will cut back on both the garam masala and the ground coriander. Two Tbs. of each is too much for me. It did go well with the cucumber and black bean salad and the peanut marinated chicken thighs. These are worth experimenting with.",
