I halved the recipe and even that made a ton--but the leftovers are just as good. If you have a mandoline I'd suggest using that to cut the fennel nice and thin so it'll blend better with the salad or you could use a food processor with the slicer blade. The only change I'd suggest is to add more cranberries and pecans because they add a lot to the flavor but get somewhat lost with the amount of veggies.",

So I subbed diced dates for the c-berries toasted walnuts for the pecans and added onion and goat cheese. I used a mandoline to slice the fennel and onion. For the dressing I added a crushed garlic clove and 2 tsp. of Dijon mustard. I used white wine vinegar instead of the red and balsamic. I took this to work potluck and the only things that were gone were my salad and the pecan pie. I warned people that the watercress tended to strike some as bitter. One person asked what the\"white stuff\" was and when I told her it was fennel she was surprised since she said she hated fennel. I will use this as a jumping off recipe in the future.",
