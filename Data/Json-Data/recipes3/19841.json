I didn't think they were too sweet, loved the pumpkin flavor and the spicing was very good (I used the recommended by Mama Cass and added just a pinch of clove), I also added a tsp of vanilla to the pumpkin mix because I don't bake anything sweet without vanilla. I also substituted low fat cream cheese with no problems to cut a little of the fat, and used a 9X13 pan, and baked for 50 minutes, it turned out perfectly. I would recommend spraying the heck out of the pan though, because I had a hard time getting them out of the pan (and I used well-seasoned stoneware, which normally nothing sticks to). \n",

He absolutely loved it, and said it's the best dessert he's ever eaten. The next day it was served with whipped cream at a family gathering, and everyone there loved it. I tried it and also thought it was great, even though I don't generally care for pumpkin pie. Before making it, I read some of the other comments that indicated the final product was not really very \"cheesecake-like\". I wanted to make something basically like a pumpkin-pie flavoured cheesecake, so I made a few changes to the recipe, and it turned out exactly like I wanted. I added an extra package of cream cheese (I used two 250g packages) and an extra egg (for a total of three eggs in the batter, plus the one in the crust). I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. For the crust I used a Duncan Hines French Vanilla cake mix, and I made it in a metal 9\" X 13\" pan (I sprayed the pan generously with cooking spray and had no trouble getting the cake out of the pan). I omitted the pecans as we don't like nuts. I baked it for about an hour.",

Made them in a 9x13 glass casserole. They came out much better the second time (the first batch was gone in a couple days) probably because I baked a good 10 min longer and also put the nuts on top of the crust before putting in the pumpkin mix. I couldn't find pumpkin spice at the store so I had to call a friend to go online and read me the ingredients someone else posted... 2 t. cinnamon 1 t. ginger 1/2 t. allspice and 1/2 t. nutmeg. The recipe should be amended with those ingredients.",
