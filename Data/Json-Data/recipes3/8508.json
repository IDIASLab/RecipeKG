If you are trying to introduce people to hominy this might do it. It's good for kids IMO but it lacked umph for me. Maybe some vegetables green onion? Also there was no size of pork so how can you cook it for an hour without the pork being rubber? I could see this used with a pork loin. there was plenty of sauce left over.",

Yellow hominy definitely makes a prettier presentation than white though the taste is the same either way. I used to have a recipe from a book for this casserole and I'm sure it called for onions and bell peppers. That would add to the color. And if you combine the soup and the water in the pork browning pan it makes the \"gravy\" sort of brown which also adds color.",

Instead of 8 pork chops is says 4 and the chops are browned in 3 tbsp butter or margarine along with 3 tbsp minced onion and 1 tbsp minced green pepper. More flavorful I think. Also says 1/3 cup milk.  I think your mom spread the recipe for a larger volume.",
