I used fresh lemon juice and olive oil rather than the balsamic vinaigrette for a lighter fresher taste. For the \"seasoned pepper' I used Montreal Steak Seasoning. That too was a good choice! And simply for a little more crunchy texture I threw in some chopped celery especially since I omitted the corn. Fairly basic but neverless tasty black bean salad which certainly can be tinkered with to suit your own tastes.",
