In 13x9 baking dish spray with PAM heavy, put chunks of unsalted butter and put empty dish into oven until melted.  Remove and put in pieces, bake 25 min - turn and bake 25 min more.  Delicious!",

Marinading in butter milk is a really good idea. (For UK readers butter milk can be found at Tesco). I cooked the chicken in an oven 200C since I don't use deep frying. I sprayed the dish with olive oil put the chicken in then sprayed it as well. Next time I'll adapt the coating by using bread crumbs and perhaps substitute the Italian seasoning with some lemon zest or another strong flavoured fruit some crushed bay leaves and some basil ground pepper perhaps some lemon grass. My wife suggests putting the chicken seasoning into the marinade instead of the salt.",

Absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe or the seasonings. My only problem was getting the chicken pieces to cook throughly. I did use dark meat which takes longer anyway but twenty minutes just didn't seem to do it even tho I used a candy thermometer. I had to place the meat in the oven for about fifteen minutes. Nontheless it was tasty crispy and enjoyed by my gang. Thanks Lora!",
