I used halved shallots instead of pearl onions. I added 1/2tsp of sugar in order to help the vegetables to retain a lovely colour. I reccomend putting it in the oven for 50 minutes instead of the full 1 hour. And remember to take the tray out of the oven halfway through cooking and stir around a bit to avoid burning.",

Well he didn't pick them out. he had a second helping and said they were \"outstanding\":) i didn't have pearl onions so i added some radishes. i had a potato that i wanted to use up so i added that as well. the colour of this dish before and after being roasted is just beautiful. i added pat of butter when they came out of the oven. i will be making this again and will make sure i have pearl onions on hand as i think they would are an integral part of this dish. This recipe is sooooo delicious and looks lovely on the plate. this one is definitely a keeper. Thank you Gemini00 for sharing a superb recipe.",
