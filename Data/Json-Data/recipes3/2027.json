                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe however it needs just a little more zip. Don't forget to add half a minced red onion (or more to taste). That really complements the tomato flavor. Salt needs to be about half a teaspoon and a hint of freshly ground black pepper. Also if you're in a hurry or out of fresh tomatoes the canned tomatoes actually substitute quite well. You can buy whole canned and chop them yourself or buy them already diced. Just make sure you buy the \"no salt added\" kind or you'll have to adjust the salt in the recipe. Oh and I think 1/4 cup of olive oil was fine since I am not too fond of oily textures. I would just add an extra tomato or two to have enough sauce. FABULOUS fresh recipe and I like to also use it as a dip on occasion...sort of an Italian salsa.",

                "reviewBody": "According to the USDA all raw fruits and veggies that have been cut or peeled should be refrigerated within two hours to prevent possible food-borne illnesses. Yes tomatoes are higher in acids than other foods but they CAN become infected with bacteria. The best-practice for safe food handling of cut tomatoes is to refrigerate within two hours and within one hour if room temperature is 90 degrees F or higher. Since 76 000 000 people (76 million- this is not a typo) get sick with food-borne illness each year in the USA and 5 000 of those people die it is a good idea to be safe instead of taking chances. As few as 10 bacteria can make you sick and bacteria can double every 20 minutes at room temperature. 10 accidental bacteria sitting in your tomatoes and olive oil now can become over 5 000 bacteria in 3 hours and over 40 000 in 4 hours.
