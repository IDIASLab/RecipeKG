I made a lot of substitutions (sake instead of wine green peppers instead of red and yellow and canned mushrooms) and a few omissions (didn't have any crushed red pepper left out the salt.) One change I would make to the recipe is to wait to boil the pasta until you are simmering the rest of the mixture. I underestimated the time it would take to get to that step. Also the sauce never thickened so I added a bit of corn starch towards the end.",

The sauce is very light and tasty as is, but I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream to thicken it up a bit. Next time I'll try adding cornstarch to thicken even more.

I modified some things due to what I had on hand. Used bow tie pasta instead of penne (prettier than penne) a whole yellow onion doubled all spices except salt (was a little bland before). Omitted the wine peas and parmesan. Only used one green pepper. Used chicken bullion instead of stock. Also had to add corn starch to thicken at the end. Next time I will be prepared and have the colored peppers on hand to improve the presentation. Deffinately a keeper for the recipe box.",
