Instead of using an onion soup mix, I sauteed 1/2 chopped onion and 1/2 chopped pepper in some butter for about 15 minutes. Then I mixed with the rest of the ingredients. I only used about 1/2 cup of lite sour cream. It turned out absoultely delicious! I'm not usually one for meatloaf since it tends to turn out dry & crumbly, too salty or too greasy and most have a ketchup topping to make it appear moist(not a fave). But this recipe was a great basis for a moist and hearty loaf, and with the alterations I made it is definitely a keeper!",
