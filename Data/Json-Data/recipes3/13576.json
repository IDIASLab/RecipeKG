It was a little too thick for my taste but adding more broth should fix that. When I made rivels for a different potato soup recipe they were made with Bisquick and egg rather than just plain flour and egg and had a nice dumpling texture. These rivels were dry and chewy to me so I'll sub in Bisquick. With those small changes I really look forward to having this again.",
