It was somewhat bland for our taste and the chayote softer than we would have liked which would have been fine for breakfast. I will make it again and substitute pepperjack cheese and boiling the chayote for 10 minutes or less. Or I might add sharp cheddar and a diced jalapeno. This is a great jumping off point for learning how to use chayote.",
