I used italian sausage and added some black and cayenne peppers to add the spice of the andouille. I will definitely make again and next time use the adouille. Really enjoyed it.",

(But on the next day.)\" I was mortified to serve this to company only to find that the beans were still hard as pebbles. I followed the recipe only simmering my beans for more like 3 hrs. and simmered the entire soup for an additional 2 hrs. I couldn't quite get the 1st step of what? Boiling the andouille only to brown it later? Also it doesn't clarify as to when to return the saffron/broth to the pot so I just did that while it was simmering. I was overjoyed at the thought of this recipe as I leap for anything that calls for either saffron (treasured spice that I so rarely use) or andouille (so tasty!) and loved the idea of using kale in a soup. And speaking of calling it \"soup\" - no way this definitely needed additional liquid as others have mentioned in their reviews. Sooo we boiled and re-simmered the soup last night and made sandwiches and I've just now sat down to a \"real\" bowl of the soup and yes it tastes fantastic - very unusual spicy and earthy. I hope to make it again but will just use canned beans and maybe dump everything except the kale in the crockpot to decrease the troublesome steps.",
