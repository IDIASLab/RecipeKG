Since there were no directions for marinating time, or cooking, I marinated in a large freezer bag for only one hour, and then grilled.  DS said \"I like the chicken this way.\"  this is a huge compliment, for he usually doesn't say anything!  I liked the flavor, and DH did, too.  The chicken was moist and tender, with a delicate flavor.  I will likely make this again, though I probably won't serve it in a tortilla.  My only sub was to use about 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, in lieu of the garlic cloves. Edited 1/16/17: I see the time listed in the description of the recipe, at the top of the page, beside the photos.

I also added an extra lime because we love the flavor. I poured over four boneless/skinless chicken breasts and four drumsticks into a plastic freezer bag making sure to get all the air out and marinating for three hours. The results were fantastic. Juicy well seasoned chicken with a tantalizing layer of flavors. The chili powder added a nice smokiness that my family liked. We will definitely use this marinade again. A.",
