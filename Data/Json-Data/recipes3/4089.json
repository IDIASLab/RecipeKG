I sauted diced yellow & red bell pepper first w/ olive oil then 1/2 a red onion (not a fan of shallots) then 3 cloves finely minced garlic. I used regluar white sliced mushrooms (that is what I had on hand) and double the amount of sage. I used 1/2 cup cream as directed but found that it wouldn't cook down. I added a bit of chicken stock (1 turn of the pan) & let simmer. Then added 1 tbl of flour to thicken. Topped with green onions. Turned out to be fantastic!!!! This sauce is very versatile. It would go well with chicken or pork. This is a great recipe. THANK YOU! I am going to put this in my monthly rotation of recipes.",
