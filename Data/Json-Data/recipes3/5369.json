Also added a bay leaf rosemary thyme orgegano pepper and basil to the simmering stew. I think without spices it would be very bland. Also let it cook longer than directed to let the potatos help thicken the stew and simmered for a while with the lid off to let some water cook off otherwise it would be pretty soupy. This is a nice dinner if you want a change from a stew using the regular stew meat and/or have some gr. beef you want to use up. Made it a one-pot meal by cooking all in a dutch oven on the stove top (just drained grease before adding rest). I thought it was pretty good and the husband loved it. Next time I think I'll add some parsley as well and maybe try the cheese suggestion. If you wanted a thicker stew I suppose you could add flour to the harmburger after you drain off the fat. I may try that next time as well.;o)",
