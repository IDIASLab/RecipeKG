I thawed between 15-20 shrimp and removed the tails.  I simmered the tails in about 3/4 cup of water with 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning and 1/2 tsp Onion Salt and 1/4 tsp red-pepper flakes until it was reduced to about a 1/2 a cup.  I then strained the broth from the shells.  I reserved 1/4 cup pasta water and mixed with the shrimp broth.  Added 1/4 cup white wine to the broth.  I used 1 TBSP butter and 2 TBSPs olive oil to saute the onions and garlic to make it healthier.  Then added the broth mixture and asparagus to the onion/garlic saute.  I didn't add tomatoes as I served bruschetta on the side.  I added the pasta at this point.  Simmered on low till most of the liquid was absorbed into the pasta and the aparagus tender.  I then added the shrimp (since it was already cooked).  Heated until hot, then served with parmesan and fresh cracked black pepper.  Hubby said he'd make that again lol!",

I would have liked a little more flavor, so next time I might sprinkle some garlic and/or onion powder on once the pasta's back in the skillet.    I'd probably also cook the shrimp in some garlic or onion powder or with fresh garlic to give it a little more flavor, and even brown the shrimp a tiny bit.\n\nWill make again.
