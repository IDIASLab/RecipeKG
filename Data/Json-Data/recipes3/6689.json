I tripled the garlic that is added to it the second part of the recipe and for the tomato puree I used a can of Rotel and just pureed it in the food processor. I also bumped up the cumin A LOT also added Adobo seasoning to taste and used a little white pepper. I made 6 lbs and left with an empty dish. It was amazing. Thank you so much for the recipe.",
