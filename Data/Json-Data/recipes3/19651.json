Also added 1 1/2 cups mushrooms too.\r\nI also reduced the oil significantly, adding only a splash of oil (and a spray of nonstick cooking spray) each time sauteeing.  Didn't have bay leaf or thyme so I used fresh basil and dried oregano and parsley instead.  Still turned out divine!\r\nAlso, be sure to remove the large pot with sauteed onions and garlic from heat until you finish adding all the other veggies (I have a gas range and the onions ended up burning, even on low heat!)\r\nServe with parmesan cheese on top to make it extra nice!",
