This is a recipe you can really play with...first off I did cheat a little and used a store bought rotisserie chicken cut up. I also used a yellow and orange pepper along with the red and green for color. I omitted the ginger and sage completely and opted for poultry seasoning a little more cumin and some chipotle red pepper. I always use a bunch of different white beans...Northern Cannellini Garbanzo Navy and even black-eyed peas (because I LOVE them). I usually will mash one can to get a thicker heartier consistency. Top with a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cut chives and a sprinkle of Cheddar cheese...it is so yummy and very satisfying!",
