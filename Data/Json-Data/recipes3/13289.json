You re definitely going to be eating a biscuit and a tender one too. One thing that I would do differently in the future is after mixing up the dough I ll put it in the fridge for maybe 5-10 minutes to firm up just a little. I flattened out the dough to a rectangle spread on the topping but rolling up was a bit of a challenge as the dough was a bit soft and started to crumble. I was unable to roll it as tightly as I would have liked. Also would recommend not spreading the honey butter all the way to the edge because you ll have it oozing out by the time that you re just about finished rolling. I had a fair amount of the honey butter left over so I ll try maybe1/3 cup each of honey & butter instead of 1/2 cup. I just refrigerated the leftover mixture as I know it will be a nice spread for a breakfast toasted English muffin. They certainly ended up looking differently than I expected but they were tasty. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

This time I spread 1/2 of mixture on the biscuits before rolling & used a pastry brush to cover tops before baking. Spread the left over mixture over the tops while still warm. It helped to use a small spatula to place the biscuits on the pan. YUM! These are great! Don't want to tell you how many I have already eaten.",

I did follow a suggestion by using a third of a cup of honey and butter and that amount worked well. I didn t however spread half of that mixture on the dough before rolling. There s no way I could have without it oozing everywhere. I will be making these again. (Also I didn t add a picture because lutzflcat s picture looked WAAAYYY better than mine!!",
