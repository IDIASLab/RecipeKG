(Add 1 or 2 Tablespoons whole milk and 2 or 3 Tablespoons sour cream (to taste.) Leave out the Nutmeg Parsnip Rutabaga and Turnip if you want a more 'kid-friendly' version as they all tend to be somewhat bitter to the younger palette. Treat these just like mashed potatoes: Butter and salt or rich gravy. I have even made potato latkes with the left-overs with great success!",

The beets were a little on the firm side but it wasnt as much or an issue as with the rutabaga... which was woody. This would be a pretty addition to a holiday table",
