My trick is to have a glass of very hot water sitting beside the mixture and also a small bowl of confectioners sugar.  I dip a spoon into the hot water then scoop the mixture with the spoon and drop into the sugar.  I then coat the ball with sugar and roll into the balls.  No mess at all!!",

The only difference is that we don't measure anything. We use an entire 1 lb bag of powdered sugar, a regular size bag of coconut and a regular size can of sweetend condensed milk.\n\nAs for tips:\n1. place the dough in the fridge or freezer before you roll them to make it easier. \n2. If you use a cookie sheet covered in wax paper you can roll the balls then store in the freezer so that they don't soften while you are dipping small batches. Which can then be placed back in the freezer to harden. \n3. make sure that the balls are fairly small in size or once you add the chocolate to the outside they will get too big, try a few different sizes to find what works best for you before you roll out all the dough.\n4. the bon bons also freeze well, you can leave batches in the freezer and pull a few out (or eat them frozen - yum) when you want a little treat or have company coming over. \n\nGood luck! You won't regret making these!",

I had to change technique to manage a shape & put an almond in the center of each ball (since the toothpick method was not working for me this time around) and coated one side at a time allowing each side time to firm up. It took more time but was worth it. I made this for my mother she loves coconut wanted to surprise her. I brought a container filled. The next morning there were 2 left:) Up shot is they tasted great like the candy bar. I am making this for my mother again. I'll have to work on technique read up on tips and practice practice practice. Thanks for the recipe.",

I like dipping mine in the melted candy wafers you use for candy making and I prefer to use white instead of chocolate. It also helps to place the dough balls on a fork and dip into the white chocolate sliding the fork against the side of the bowl to get the excess off and place on waxed paper. Depending on the holiday I'll sprinkle little candy decos on them before the chocolate firms up to make them prettier. Like Valentine sprinkles or Christmas ones. Just a few suggestions.",
