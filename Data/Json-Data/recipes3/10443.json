I did some modifications based on my preferences ( I never saute plain chicken...it must always be marinated or seasoned because I find it too bland otherwise). The base and combination of flavours and ingredients were new to me and that is why I am giving this a 5. AND it's pretty healthy!!So I sauteed the chicken first (seasoned and marinated for a 4 hours with salt pepper garlic powder cumin soy sauce and the vinegar) then I took it out and sauteed the onions garlic peppers and rest of the sauce and seasoning with the green beans until they softened...about 8-10 minutes adding the tomatoes chicken and cilantro towards the end to heat through. Sorry to modify as the first reviewer but I really wanted to review and tell you I never would have thought to throw these things together so this recipe deserves 5 stars and for people to give it a try!

Have to eat this over rice to thin out the 'urgh!'\" Made this as directed (using fresh green beans instead of frozen) and should've trusted my gut when using 1 TB cumin 6 TB soy sauce 6 TB white wine vinegar and 1 c. cilantro; yes those seemed just unusual enough of ingredients that I figured they would come together in an interesting flavorful way but in that amount it was OVERPOWERING. I would gladly make this again but would drastically reduce everything or would consider like a previous review marinating the chicken first in some of the soy/cumin/OO. Strangely enough we liked the tomatoes in this best of all and I thought that was the most peculiar addition but what made this edible for us at least was serving it over plain basmati to take away some of the /carton-eyes-popping-out-of-head.",

I used 2T soy sauce, 1 tsp of cumin, 1T vinegar, 1 clove garlic, 1 small onion, 1 small vine tomato. Only had frozen cilantro where 1 Cube equals a teaspoon. I have no idea how to convert fresh  loose cilantro to chopped frozen so I finished my pack and added 6 cubes. I had no peppers at all but went ahead anyway. Cooked the green beans alone first to almost doneness. Then saut\u00e9ed the onions separately, added garlic, added back the beans,  soy, cumin, vinegar, and little salt. Added cilantro cubes at the end. Came out decent. Would definitely make again and try to find some Chile paste to use.",
