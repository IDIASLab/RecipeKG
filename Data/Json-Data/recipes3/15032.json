That flavor may be subtle but you still taste it. If you re looking for a cornbread muffin this isn t it but if you want to step outside-the-box and try something new that has a hint of cornbread this IS it. My diet just would not allow 7 eggs for 12 muffins so the only substitution I made was using Egg Beaters which worked well. The texture is not cornbread-like more like a cake very light. Love the contrast between the spicy jalape\u00f1os and the tart cranberries and there is just the right amount of sweetness. Never cooked with coconut flour before but I was able to buy just a cup from the bulk food sections at Sprouts to give this recipe a try and I m so glad I did. Not sure how to describe this interesting muffin because it s neither savory nor sweet but it is SIMPLY GOOD! Super moist and tender a hit in this house.",
