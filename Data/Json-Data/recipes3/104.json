The pinwheels were light and flaky and packed with lots of flavour from the prociutto and parmesan. I used a mild lean prociutto thinly sliced and reggiano (the type of parmesan I prefer to use in all my cooking) so that it wouldn't be too salty. I also ended up using 2 large tablespoons of regular dijon mustard as the 2 teaspoons the recipe called for wasn't enough to coat the sheet of pastry. Maybe I'll try hot dijon next time to kick up the flavour meter even more...",

I too omitted the mustard and substituted olive oil garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. Everyone loved them. A great tip that worked for me was to refrigerate the uncut roll for about 15 minutes. This gave the dough time to rest and made cutting very easy. Also I think it helped with the unraveling problem that others seemed to have. Thanks for the recipe.",
