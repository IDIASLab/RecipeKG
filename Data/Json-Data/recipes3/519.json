I also increased to amount of scallions to 3tbsp. and used 3 tbsp. of the hommade pom. syrup. Excellent!!",

Definitely a rich dish but very well-received. Shelling the pistachios took forever!",

For those of you who don't want to make the sauce I'd suggest mixing the ground/diced pistachio with garlic powder finely grated parmigiano reggiano pepper and salt to taste. I frequently use this on tilapia and it tastes great! I'll be sure to try again with the sauce - it sounds great (I just had no pomegranate)!",

I think next time I will add more of the syrup. I found Pomegranate Glaze at Trader Joe's. If I need to have true syrup I'd probably go to a Middle Easter market to find it. It was a bit strong on the wine but I loved it. I was hoping for a sweeter taste. I will definitely make this again and I will try it with pork chops like another reviewer recommended. The chicken breast was moist but a bit dry. I served this over basmati rice and found it to be a wonderful dish. I may add just a dash of salt to the suauce.",
