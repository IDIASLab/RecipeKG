This was my first attempt at dumplings and I'm no chef but based on the recipe, there didn't seem like enough liquid to poach the dumplings.  It smelled wonderful and was overall pretty easy to prepare but my dumplings would have made better landfill.  They were rubbery and just overall nasty.  I don't blame this on the recipe but my inexperience - but I still think that there should be more liquid some how.  I'll give this another try, I just don't think I'll use this particular recipe again.",
