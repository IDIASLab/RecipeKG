Peanut oil burns at a temperature much hotter than most vegetable oils, so it's got to be heated on high.  Using your longest tongs, put a small clump of spinach in the hot oil and keep it there- you need to use the tongs to keep the spinach submerged or else it will float to the top of the oil and won't fry correctly.  The fried spinach should be really dark green, light and airy, and it should just melt in your mouth. It's a nice complement to heavy meats and fish steaks. By the way, it so quick that you can make this recipe literally at the last moment, as food is being carried to the table.",

                "reviewBody": "In experimenting with this unusual recipe, my colleagues and I felt that while the idea is novel and the product is potentially shatteringly crisp and tasty, the instructions could perhaps benefit from some enhancement. At the outset, it is essential that the spinach leaves be thoroughly and completely dry. Guard yourself against the normal spattering of oil that can occur with a moisture-laden vegetable such as spinach. Of equal importance is the choice of oils: while peanut oil is a good choice, especially for flavour, if you have access to grape seed oil, do try it for its light taste and high smoke point. Experiment with the frying time; some of the leaves will fry crisp in 5 seconds, some will take longer. The ones that we let go for 30 seconds were overly done. Employ the use of a cooking thermometer as the temperature of the oil will drop with each frying event. Finally, do sprinkle not only with salt and pepper but also with finely grated parmesan cheese.",

I used vegetable oil because I did not have peanut oil. I found that the spinach tasted best when I fried it in small batches for 30-45 seconds and when the spinach was chopped into medium/small pieces. When I put in large pieces of spinach I would leave it in the deep fryer for a longer amount of time but it just did not come out as light airy and crisp as the other pieces. I ate the spinach alone sprinkled with salt and pepper and think it would be great in the future on salads or as a side to fish/chicken with fresh lemon squeezed on top. Thanks for a unique and tasty twist on spinach:)",
