The Cornell recipe calls for gently heating the sauce since it's often made in bulk prior to the big event. All summer long one can smell wonderful fumes from the chicken bbq picnics and fundraisers -- fire depts lodges churches scouts and charities! I made this sauce using the AR recipe for poultry seasoning tossed a Ziploc bag filled with sauce and chicken into a very cold fridge for 2 hrs; used reserved sauce to baste grilling chicken. Everything must be cooked to a very safe temperature. My belief system regarding barbeque sauces: all good some better.",
