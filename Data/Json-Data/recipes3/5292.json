I also thought that the dough mixture was almost too dry; and could definitely benefit from some extra orange juice. It also formed a thick crust that I just wasn't too fond of (I'm thinking it's due to using honey instead of sugar?). I would make it again with some changes and maybe add in some blueberries or cranberries for extra flavor.",
