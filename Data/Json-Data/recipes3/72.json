The first time I made this I dumped everything in a bowl and it was kinda runny. But the 2nd time I made it I drained the corn and it made such a huge difference. Also when dealing with the spicey aspects of the dip I used 8oz of chilies instead 7 I put the peppers and the green onions together in a food processor and spooned in the \"perfect\" amount-- I added more onions and peppers to the food processor than recommended so that way I wasn't limited nor was I adding too much. I've made this twice and everyone loves it and I plan to make it many many more times!",

Definitely refrigerate this overnight because that's when the magic happens and the flavors blend together and the peppers heat everything up.  I like it a little hotter so I don't remove the seeds from the jalepenos and I also add 3 habaneros and their seeds.  Three of each seems to be the best for most people I've made this for.  When it's just for me, I add 5 habaneros and it's not inferno-hot, but just enough to make your mouth tingle for a while.  This makes about 7 cups of dip and you'll need two 15oz bags of Fritos Scoops to go with it.  Super easy, super fast, super yummy!",
