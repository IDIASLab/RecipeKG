I use the refrigerated pie crust that you unroll into the pie pan, just prick it a lot on the bottom.  I also add chopped bacon (I usually cook up a whole package, whatever my husband doesn't steal from the plate goes into the pie, usually about 3/4 of a pound.) I like to use a 4 cheese Italian mixture you can get from the store of parmesean, romano, asaigo, and aged provolone. Use very fresh tomatoes!",

I sprinkle some Monterey Jack cheese, (I prefer this to Morzarella)to the bottom of the pre-baked crust and then added some spinach leaves so the crust doesn't get too soggy. It's important to drain the tomatoes well. The topping is what makes this taste so good so I double the amount. This is a good way to use up those home grown tomatoes!

Because there were a lot of non mayo and onion eaters I left those two ingredients out. Instead, I roasted a head of garlic, squeezed it out, mashed it and spread it on the bottom of the pie crust. I used a combo of Fontina and parm cheeses on the bottom of the crust and also over the top of the tomatoes. To make life a little easier, I baked it in a tart pan with a removeable bottom and sliced with a pizza cutter. When it came out, half the guests thought it was pizza and the other half thought it was a fritatta. Whatever you prefer to call it, the pie was delicious and gone in minutes. Thanks Britt!",
