This has been a staple in our house since before I was born- now my kids love it too!\nIn order for this dish to taste SUPREME you have to fry the cabbage with the onion.  In fact I put the cabbage in the pan for about 10 minutes before I add the onion.  Let the cabbage lightly brown for the most tasty result.  Egg noodles are great but you can use Farfalle, Rotini or Elbows.  ENJOY this comfort food! We tend to use a lot of pepper and salt for this recipe as well as garlic powder.",

Start with at least 1 stick of SALTED butter to saute the onions. Use a stock pot when doing this and add the cabbage a little at a time cause it won't cook down in a timely fashion if you add it all at once. Add the noodles into the cabbage and stir in pot and add more butter as needed until it's all coated to your liking. I usually use a total of 1 1/2 sticks to 2 sticks of salted butter. This is also how my Czech grandmother made it.",

The taste for this dish must be in my blood! I always fry the onion and cabbage together instead of steaming the cabbage... to me it tastes better this way and you don't have an extra pot to clean. I always eat it with a dollop of sour cream on top... adds a creamy texture. So simple yet SO delicious! My very American boyfriend loves it too (although he likes it with Cheddar on the top).
