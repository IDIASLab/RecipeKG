The directions do not specify thickness and I pressed mine out to about 3/4 inch thick. This made a 12\" circle which is a bit large for a scone. Next time I will divide the dough in half to make two circles and smaller scones. I liked the crunchy edges and creating two smaller circles could give more crunch to the middle. I feel that a single dough circle pressed out to a taller scone would have increased the cooking time even more.",
