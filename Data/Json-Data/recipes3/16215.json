I cut them up and put them on paper towels and add some Italian seasoning to them. Let them sit on the paper towel for 5 minutes or so and that takes some of the liquid out of them. Also I do not use milk instead I use kefir or yogurt. Sometimes I also add some torn spinach. It's that type of recipe that you can add or substitute and it's always delicious.",
