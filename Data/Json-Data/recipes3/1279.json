The second the alcohol hits the raw oyster, they begin to \"cook\" and roll off a putrid smell *and taste* that is a cross between rubbing alcohol and lacquer thinner.   I was given this recipe to try from some of my bay friends in San Diego. The restaurants down there that we went to only sell shooters like this.  No matter how bad the taste, I have never spit out food in public - until trying these.  I had to come back to my favorite sushi house in BOISE just to renew my faith and love in raw oysters that were done right.  (Shame on you, San Diego!)  lol",
