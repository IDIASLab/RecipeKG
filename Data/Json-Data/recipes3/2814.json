I learned 4 things: (1) do check your diced tomatoes to be sure they aren't canned in balsamic vinegar - ew (2) large pasta like penne sticks out of the \"sauce\" and hardens (3) this would fit in a 9x9 and keep everything moist and (4) everything is already cooked so the 1 hour cooking time dried it out. Next time I'll use smaller pasta put it in a 9x9 and only cook for 30 minutes topping it with cheese in the last few minutes.",
