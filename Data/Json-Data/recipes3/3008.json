I added a couple drops of hoisin sauce because I read a review that it tasted a bit bland. I'm not even very familiar with the taste of that sauce I hardly use it but I had some on hand. I also liked that this calls for whole wheat bread. I didn't have any sesame seeds so I used bread crumbs. I have put sesame seeds on my grocery list because I think I would prefer them with it. This is my fav appetizer at the restaurant & I usually spend between 2.50 & 4.00 in the chinese restaurant. No more! Thanks! P.S. I wish they could have a video on how to make this. I just want to be sure I am preparing them correctly.",
