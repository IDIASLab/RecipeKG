I used 1-2 cups of homemade ranch dressing (I like my potato salad creamy and they tend to dry out).  It's not fat free by any means but really does make the yummy flavor.  Also, instead of mayo, I used miracle whip.  I feel like it gives it more flavor than mayo.  Also, added a little horseradish and didn't have parsley the 2nd go around so used dried.  It tasted just as good as the first batch that had the fresh parsley.  Everything else I left as is.  This is a keeper recipe!  Thank you.",
