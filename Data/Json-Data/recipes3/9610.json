I tried this recipe to see the difference steel cut oats would make in the texture. As it called for no sweetener I added 2/3 c of packed brown sugar (adding 55 calories per serving). I also increased the amount of fruit in order to use up blueberries. Also when I was making it I got distracted and forgot this was supposed to be an overnight recipe. It turned fine. For breakfast I think I like this one better. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/healthy-baked-steel-cut-oatmeal/",

Even with those extras it was just ok. It's not a cake to heavy. It's not a bar too light and moist. It's like sweet oat quiche. I don't think leaving it over night helps much. I suspect if one baked it right after combining the mixtures together it might be more cake like. I think leaving sit over night loses what ever raising abilities the baking powder had. I am going keep looking for something better to use steel cut oats in.",
