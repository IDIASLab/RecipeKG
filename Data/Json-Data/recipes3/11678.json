First, the positive \u2013 the curry offered just a hint of its flavor and a pleasant touch of sweetness.  The shrimp, too, was a creative touch, but I\u2019m glad I used raw shrimp rather than cooked, which contributed its flavor to the broth as it cooked.  The minced garlic I added along with the onion and leeks helped in the flavor department too.  I did use half-and-half rather than milk and was glad for it as the soup was still a little too thin. And I think there was too much butter too \u2013 I found I preferred to skim some of it off the top of the soup before I served it, so half the amount would have been plenty. But here\u2019s my single, biggest criticism \u2013 I should have trusted my instincts when I saw the relatively small amount of leeks in the recipe for this LEEK and Potato Soup with Shrimp.  I went ahead and followed the recipe as directed, but found that the taste of leeks was just barely noticeable and could easily have been doubled.",

I also used fresh Argentina Red shrimps that really enhanced the broth. I did not continue to simmer after I mixed in the cream and shrimp. The temp is so high at that point all you need to do is mix in these last two ingredients and let is set for about 15 minutes or so...this cooks the shrimp without overcooking it gives the flavors a chance to blend and cools the soup just enough to where it can be served and consumed immediately.",

And while I was musing over replacements I thought about coconut milk. So I added a half cup coconut milk and a half cup heavy cream. By the time I finished the soup I'd used about a full cup of coconut milk a half cup of heavy cream and an extra teaspoon of curry. Absolutely delicious.:)",

After letting the leeks and potatoes simmer for 20 minutes I took about a cup of the soup out and used an immersion blender on the rest and then added the cup back in. This gave me more creaminess without the added fat of cream. I also added fresh corn kernels from two cobs of corn when I added the milk and I let my defrosted shrimp cook in the soup instead of cooking them ahead of time. Finally, my soup needed a little more depth so I added two Knorr vegetable soup bouillon cubes to the pot. Delicious with some crusty bread.",
