                "reviewBody": "Great flavor! Instead of a chili seasoning packet, I used a couple tablespoons of Penzey's Chili 9000 seasoning.   The bacon was a nice addition, however the flavor was almost undetectable, so next time I will add a few more slices. I also recommend using more than just a \"pinch\" of garlic and onion powder.    More importantly, there is no liquid whatsoever in this recipe, so I recommend not draining the tomatoes (I kept it), and I also added about 1/2 cup of broth. Even still, it could use a bit more liquid so next time I will use 1 cup of broth or tomato sauce.  I didn't have time to wait for my crockpot, so after browning the meat in my InstantPot, I cooked everything on the chili setting for 25 mins. It came out perfectly done! The other thing to mention is that these portions are rather small, so I'd say this makes 6 servings max.",

I made a mistake and used 3 bell peppers instead of 1 1/2 when reducing the servings to 4--so I upped the tomatoes to a 28 oz can (I used crushed/peeled as it is what I had) didn't add the tomato paste as it was tomato-ey enough. I'm Keto so I made the Chili Seasoning Mix I instead of the packaged chili mixes as I couldn't find one that didn't have added sugars/starches. My husband isn't Keto and he enjoyed this as well.! I also adjusted the cooking instructions a bit--I used the my instant pot on saute for the meat and veggies and then the slow cooker function--with vent closed and on low temp when I added all of the ingredients to the pot for two hours.",
