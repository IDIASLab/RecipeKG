My husband (who cannot stand egg rolls OR won tons LOVED THESE!!). I did adjust the recipe by adding a bit more worcestershire. There were two things I was confused about: 1) How to roll them. Basically just imagine you are rolling a tiny egg roll - just barely tuck in the sides and them roll them the long way. 2) Should I drain the grease before adding veggies? The original recipe said to add oil to the ground beef & this confused me... DEFINITELY drain before adding veggies. ANYWAY - they were REALLY GOOD and I will DEFINITELY make them again.",

I also added a lot more Worcestershire sauce (maybe 2-3 TB) and some onion and garlic powder for more flavor. They turned out fabulous. I froze them and then baked them just like in the directions for a party and they were a hit. Sweet and sour sauce was the most popular sauce by far. Good recipe!!",
