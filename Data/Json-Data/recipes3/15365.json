You can get 9 scoops out of it that way.\nTry it this way too (for those who like peanutbutter and chocolate!)\ninstead of the 3 &1/2 tbl of butter use one tablespoon of butter and 3 to 4 table spoons of peanutbutter (i like to use Adam's creamy).

I was going to give this 4 stars, but I'm giving a bonus star for this quick, easy recipe of ingredients I had on hand...you saved me from having to resort to eating chocolate chips out of the bag!  I used mini chocolate chips, and they melted really well.  Also, as a previous review mentioned, I had no idea what golden syrup was so I used corn syrup (thanks previous reviewer!).  I've since looked up golden syrup, and apparantly it's a syrup similar in taste and appearance to honey.  It can be used as a substitute for either honey or corn syrup.  In the future, I may try this recipe with honey instead...that might add an interesting flavor, and be closer to the taste of the original recipe using golden syrup.  Thanks!",

I recommend putting Cadbury Chocolate mini eggs on top to make them nests. You can buy mini-eggs at Ralphs any time around Easter.",

In Ireland we call it Chocolate Cracknel (sometimes spelled Cracknell/Kracknell). When I was a kid we would get Chocolate Cracknel as the dessert in school dinners at least once a week. The dinner ladies would make it in big large 13x9\" trays and they would cut them into squares and pour hot English custard over it with a scoop of ice-cream. Because it is my biggest pot I use my pressure cooker (with the lid off) on very low to melt the chocolate butter and golden syrup (Karo syrup is the best US substitute) stirring with a wooden spoon. Once totally melted I take my pressure cooker pot off the heat and add the cornflakes and mix in the cornflakes. Using one pot to melt the chocolate etc and mix the cornflakes saves washing more dishes. I use the 15 serving version of this recipe and put it in a 8 or 9\" pie dish and cut into triangles or put it in a 8 or 9 \" square pan and cut into squares. For my little one I take a 2 teaspoon mini ice-cream scoop and scoop them into mini paper muffin cups. Once cooled Chocolate Cracknel (if well hidden) can stay fresh in a sealed tin up to 2 weeks.",
