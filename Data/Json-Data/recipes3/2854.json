When making the sauce, add 1 cup of milk to your sauce pan and reserve 1/2 a cup cold milk to mix your dry ingredients in.  Mix the dry ingredients into the 1/2 cup cold milk and mix thoroughly--you will prevent lumps this way. Add the remaining 1/2 cup and stir.  I found it didn't thicken very well until I added the cheese.  I kept the cheese on the heat until the sauce thickened.  3. I recommend adding a second cheese.  I added romano but parmasean, monteray Jack or any other sharp cheese would  really enhance the flavour. 4.  I crushed up 2 crackers and put them on top, I sprayed a bit of olive oil onto them to allow for browning.  I also grated a bit of cheedar cheese onto the bread crumbs maybe 2-3 tbsp.",
