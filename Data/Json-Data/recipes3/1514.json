I added a little more sour apple at the end after tasting as I wanted a stronger apple flavour but other than that I made no changes. These are coming with me to a 40th birthday party:D Hope they go over well but if not I'll just have to make the sacrifice of eating them all myself.",

But, the cones will get soft after a while. They still taste amazing but soft ice cream cones are no bueno. I made a dark chocolate ganache and coated the insides of the cones using a basting brush, then chilled for an hour before filling with the pudding. I also upped the vodka content a little. And, the recipe creator suggested using rice to stabilize the cones, but I decided to buy a squeezable package of icing and placed a small dollop on the bottom of the cone, after coating with the ganache, and placing it on a cookie sheet. It worked out really well! Enjoy!",
