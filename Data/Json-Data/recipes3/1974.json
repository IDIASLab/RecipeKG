That makes it probably the fastest sugar cookie to make. These are meant to be iced. I highly recommend using the Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies on this website. Using these two together I have decorated cookies for Valentine's Day Halloween and Christmas.",

I substituted butter for shortening and added a pinch of baking powder to puff them up a little bit. I did need to refrigerate the dough before rolling it out. When they cooled them I mixed up a thin icing of confectioner's sugar corn syrup a touch of juice and some food coloring. The cookie is perfect for a fruity icing since it is not to sweet. The icing hardens and the cookies look and taste as though they're from a bakery. Everyone loved them.",

I actually made it for 144 servings (288 cookies) for family and gift giving. wow. a luscious cutout cookie that improved as the days went on...it did not disintigrate or get crumbly and was a dream to decorate. As it is not too sweet the icing was the treat and it got an A-1 rating by the hubby and kids for dunking in milk or hot cocoa. Very addictive cookies. YUMMY! (Note: blend all ingredients very carefully as you go if you're making a mega-batch especially!)",

This maybe was because the eggs they sell in my country are sort of big well I bet in the US they're bigger haha but I seriously thaught that if I added the other egg I would screw up the recipe:C adding the flour the dough was kind of falling apart a little bit but when I 'kneaded' it a while longer that didn't happen anymore. I was too sleepy to bake them last night so I baked them this morning and instead of icing I decorated them with some colored sugar they turned out really nice! My family really loved them and I think I'm going to use this recipe again for Valentine's or something;! Thank you SO much for the recipe:)",
