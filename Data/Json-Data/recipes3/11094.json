After they eat it their story changes to 'that was amazing!' I know the idea of mayo and mustard on a scrambled egg disk sounds odd, but trust me; you'll love it. I know the cooking method for the eggs may be sacrilege for some folks; I just ask that you try it before changing it up.",

I used toasted whole grain bread and opted to add a slice of cheese. I liked the mayo and mustard combo, but will probably go back to my old standard...ketchup. My husband enjoyed his and of course had to add some bacon! Overall, very good especially with a side of fresh fruit and OJ. Definitely one of those \"don't knock it until ya try it\" kind of recipes - and I'm glad I tried it!",

While doing that I toasted my bread in the toaster. When the toast was done I set both slices on a cookie sheet I turned on the broiler and added the cooked egg and a slice of cheese to one piece of the toast. To the other slice of toast I spread some mayo and mustard on it and then added a couple slices of honey ham. Then I broiled the open faced sandwich for about 3-4 minutes to melt the cheese:) Once done I put a few drops of red hot sauce on it and put it together:) It was absolutely delicious! Never had an egg sandwich with mustard and mayo but I'm hooked now! I usually just used ketchup but the mayo mustard gives the sandwich a new unique flavor!??",
