When I came back 20 minutes later I was left with a thick sticky ooze in the bottom of the pan that could barely be scooped out let alone poured. I had used all of my balsamic vinegar to make this and had to serve it in 30 minutes so I placed the \"ooze\" in my food processor with 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar. I blended that while drizzling in 1/4 cup of olive oil and then strained the whole thing. The final product was delicious but not at all what I anticipated. So watch your vinegar very closely and don't let it reduce too far. But if you do you can try my method to save it.",
