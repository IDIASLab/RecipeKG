As a chef, it's not only hard for me that she can't eat my creations--which have every bit of food we love--but it's hard to find and make gluten-free recipes that suit her needs. I didn't want her feeling left out of family dinners, so when I saw this recipe, I knew it would be a snap to make. The texture is wonderful, and the flavors are fantastic. My entire family loves this, and now I'll make it often when my sister visits. It's delicious, flavorful, easy, and spot-on perfect. Give it a try!",
