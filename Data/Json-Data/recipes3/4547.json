It forgives you your lack of properly calibrated measuring devices, and this commitment to mediocrity is oddly endearing. Sometimes we don't want to feel held to society's standards of excellence. Sometimes we don't want to compete. Sometimes, maybe more often than we'd like to admit, we just want to melt two or three pasty-white ingredients together and look at Facebook for an hour. This dish is almost an act of rebellion, if you think about it.",

I enjoyed the balsalmic, dijon and dill pickle flavors, they blend well together.  I found that the tuna mix was enough for two sandwiches.  What a great idea to have the bread toast in the oven while you make the filling, I like multitasking! I would definitely make this recipe again, I wouldn't change a thing!",

Also be sure to taste this first because you could easily add more mustard and vinegar to what you prefer. I did add a tad more mayo and a dash of freshly ground black pepper.
