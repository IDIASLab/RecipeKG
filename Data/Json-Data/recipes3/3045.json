Second and more serious is that it is way too dry as a couple people here already mentioned. I have checked a dozen or more Skyline recipes on the internet and most of them mention adding 3 cups or 1 quart of water which would make the consistancy more like that of Skyline's. As the recipe is here there is not enough liquid and it is more like a thick paste. Either this recipe has not been tried by the auther or she left something out when she typed the recipe.",

I would suggest NOT browning the meat first; let it cook in the sauce stirring constantly. (hint; use a hand-held mixer to finely shred the meat in early cooking stage). Some folks have suggested adding beans to the sauce during cooking - that's not how we do it in Cincy. the basic chili is \"garnished\" with the addition of beans finely chopped onions & finely shredded cheddar cheese. Adding all of these garnishes yields a \"4-Way\" adding any two = a \"3-way\" etc. I have never seen olives used as a garnish with this dish but I suppose that could work - just not authentic! use plenty of cocoa powder for that Cincinnati-caffeine kick.",

You should mix the dry ingredents with the the liquids and mix in the meat also instead of 2 cans of tomato sause use 1 can of sause and i can of paste bring to a rolling boil the reduce and simmer for about and hour to hour and a half. the meat will melt in you mouth. Try it like this i promise it's wonderful.",

I added petite diced tomatoes (1/2 a 28oz can) 1/2 a 28 oz can of tomatoe sauce 1 1/2 tsp Cinnamon 2 galic cloves and 1/1/2 tsp cocoa. I served this with cheese and sour cream. Yumm!

I do know cocoa and cinnamon is a must have. I lived in cincy most of my life. Anyone from that area knows you always add cocoa and cinnamon.
