Right after I put the ham on I added saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and onions only to half cuz my hubby doesn't like mushrooms. I had some cloverleaf rolls leftover from dinner last night that worked really well. I used only 5 eggs and used half milk and half heavy cream.I also added a little garlic salt and a sprinkle of mustard powder to the eggs. I cooked it ten extra minutes and put tomatoes on top when it was done then salt/peppered them as I don't like hot cooked tomatoes as much. I needed a recipe for an egg bake that didn't need to be refrigerated all night and this fit the bill. I will make again but I'll add a little more spices for more flavor.",
