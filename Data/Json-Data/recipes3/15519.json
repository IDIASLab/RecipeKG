It was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Yum! Thank you!!!",

I put both the dry combination's in large baggies and shook them, instead of using bowls. I could only fit three pork chops in my iron skillet, so I only put in 1 cup of oil. For those of you who had problems, if the oil is too hot, the outside of the pork will cook faster than the inside. If the breading of falling off, that probably means you don't have enough oil. When you're frying, you can't skimp on the oil! Thank you for posting this. We had a lovely dinner tonight!",

The only thing I would do, is add more seasoning to the flour coating and maybe add a little more on the one side as I brown it in the pan, As we do like a lot of spices on everything.    And since I like my husbands meals hot when he walks through the door, I browned them first and finished them off in the oven.  (in case of traffic issues making him late)  Thank you so much harperfamiy, for sharing this with us. I will be making this often and will be trying the coating on chicken next time.",

                "reviewBody": "I bought 4 packages of pork loin boneless rib chops (15) for a great deal and wanted to try a breaded fried recipe. I only cook fried food maybe once a year. This was it. I started with most of the original ingredients though I didn't have saltine crackers or potato flakes. In the first bowl I increased the flour for the additional 11 chops (2 cups was plenty) added powdered sage cumin brown sugar powdered cinnamon ground red pepper and increased all other original ingredients by sight. No change to the milk and two eggs bowl. In the cracker bowl I started with fancy herb and garlic crackers some ritz knockoffs added crunchy honey oats cereal and some bran flakes cereal all crushed. As I tried one chop with the crackers and one with just the flour seasoning and egg I decided the chops with crackers where definitely better. I added some chil powder to the cracker cereal mix to give it what I thought it was missing. I did turn the heat down to medium and flipped at about 4.5 minutes per side to get the right color crust (used canola oil) So here I am with 13 fantastic chops at 2AM I'm not hungry after the first two. Tomorrow I'll do a chicken gravy and rice dish to go along with it and hook up the neighbors and girls at work. Thanks Becca for a great recipe. I'm giving it 5 stars because it inspired my additions and it came out tender and juicy. - Dale",

Well who am I to say no to my love. In an effort to get away from traditional Italian breaded I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Let me just say that supper was a big hit. Only thing I did different was to use ritz crackers cause no saltines and added a little herbs di Provence to the flour with s&p. Made some peppered country gravy with the cooking oil and flour to make a rue and used some chicken stock and milk. DW says this is a keeper for sure. Chops were tender and juicy didn't even need a knife with just the right amount of crispness. Note to others be sure you have enough oil this more like deep frying your chops should almost float and be sure of temp. I used 3/4 inches of oil at setting 7 on electric range and they were perfect golden brown. Thank you for sharing recipe I just sorry didn't get pics will post next time.",

Frying them for 5 minutes on each side made them very dark brown while the meat was still pink inside. So I threw them in the oven like another reviewers suggested which made the juices run out and got the bottoms soggy. By the time we sat down to eat the breading was falling off the meat even on the top. My fiance liked them but he's not picky. Don't know that I will be making these again.",
