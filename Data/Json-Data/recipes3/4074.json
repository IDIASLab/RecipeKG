I also added thyme and extra garlic and I used one cup of bread crumbs instead of two. Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",

I scooped out the eggplant and then I brushed the shells with olive oil and about t0 minutes before i wanted to serb ve the dinner I baked the shells!! Then just beforew they were done i did the rest. Once the shells were done I piled in the cooked BRIEFLY shrimp basil wine and chopped eggplant. This I then piled into the cooked shells and spread the smaller mix of bread crumbs and parmewsan cheese. It was wonderful! The shrimp were not tough.",

I stumbled upon this recipe and couldn't wait to try. I took the advice of others by doubling shrimp and reducing bread crumbs in half. I didn't use all of the eggplant flesh in the stuffing...left out the especially seedy sections. Sauteed (in 1/4c oil) 1/4c chopped red onion 1/2c chopped mushroom 3 cloves minced garlic 1/4c chopped roasted red pepper (canned) 1c chopped eggplant 1/2c chicken broth (instead of wine) 16 shrimp chopped and 1/8c fresh basil. Made sure to add the shrimp at very end so they didn't become rubbery. Used 1/2c parm cheese in stuffing and lite sprinkle on top. Baked for 35 minutes and let rest for 5. They were delicious and filling. Served with supreme spinach from AR and garlic texas toast. Can't wait to make again!",
