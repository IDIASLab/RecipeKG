Yes I tasted the baking soda some now some of you might think I'm alittle odd but the truth is I just like that flavor. But now that we are making it again I'm going to add a little less baking soda see if it still turns out good. I'm thinking if the first few don't turn out well we can easily add more. I'm doing a quarter teaspoon less per batch. But we liked it so well that I'm making it 4 times the recipe this time. I'm so glad to find some recipes that have a good flavor that I don't have to keep trying and failing all the time. Thanks for sharing! I've tried so many different things on my own when things didn't taste really good at all and I ate it anyway as I could not afford to buy expensive ingredients and throw it out.",
