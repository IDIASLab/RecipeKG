I bake it \"crustless\" in a pyrex pie plate (which I \"grease\" with Olive Oil) because I don't particularly care for \"prepared\" pie crusts. I like it with Blue Cheese Dressing but Ranch works nicely too. I LOVE the Tuna/Spinach/Bacon mix but (pre-cooked) boneless chicken breast (instead of tuna) works well too. I LOVE Swiss chees but sometimes I use Provolone Velveeta or Pepperjack. Sometimes I include chopped onions scallions fresh mushrooms and/or bell peppers. One \"pie\" lasts me 2 or 3 days. Sometimes I make toast sometimes I have Saltine or Ritz Crackers with it. Regardless it's ALWAYS good.",

I did use fresh spinach as opposed to frozen because it is what I had on hand but I don't think that changed the integrity of the recipe. I do agree with another reviewer that there was not enough egg to make it have the true mouth feel of a quiche. So next time I will add two more eggs and skip the cornstarch. Thanks Ms. Kitti for posting this recipe!",

I sauteed mushrooms garlic onions with the spinach and bacon! I was afraid to add the tuna and dressing at that point so I basically have a spinach bacon and swiss cheese quiche. I also added a small mixture of mixed cheddar cheeses at the bottom. Like others I reduced the milk. I browned the pie crust for 10 minutes only because my hubby likes it that way. I really like it and I look forward to trying this again over the holidays! I rate it a 4 but I'm sure an upgrade is coming soon!",
