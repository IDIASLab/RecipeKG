I used Italian seasoning, onion powder and fresh minced garlic (sauteed with the fresh onion). I also added 2 tbsp. of tomato paste. One other thing that I had seen in another recipe was to wrap the potatoes and the carrots in their own foil packets placed on top of the roast.  This did keep the vegetables from getting too mushy. Anyway, this recipe will be a keeper.",

I had added an envelope of Lipton Onion Soup mix and I doubled the amount of seasonings and the beef was *still* kind of bland.\n\nAlso, the carrots and potatoes were WAY too soft and the onions just disintegrated.  \n\nI would suggest cooking the beef under pressure with one onion, for about 90% of the amount of time, releasing the pressure and then adding in the potatoes, carrots, and another sliced onion for the remaining time. That way the vegetables aren't mush.  I think two envelopes of the onion soup mix would lend this dish more flavor.",

I also diced some onion into the sauteing oil, just for the heck of it. \nI was a little worried when I opened it up and saw all the liquid in there. I was afraid that it would be as dry as my crockpot roasts. However, I fished it all out, set the pot to saute again, boiled up the liquid and whisked in some flour to make gravy. Best pot roast I have ever made.",

The pressure cooker isn\u2019t the best place for something that needs to be slow cooked. ... Following the advice of some of the reviewers,  I doubled up on all the spices, used fresh rosemary and fresh garlic, I reduced the amount of liquid and included red wine.\u2026 Even with reducing the liquid, there was still too much liquid left at the end. Which I had to saut\u00e9 for an extra 40 min to reduce. \n\nI used 3 1/2 pound roast,  cooked it on high pressure for 70 min, but the inside was still tough. I peeled off some of the meat that came off easy and then put the rest back in for another 30 minutes, it still wasn\u2019t tender enough after that, so again had to cut parts of it and put it back in for longer, while saut\u00e9ing the sauce to reduce it. \n\nI included the onions, and added extra, but I did not put it in with carrots and potatoes as I\u2019ve made that mistake in the past\u2026 They don\u2019t turn out well in the pressure cooker for that long. \n\nThe flavour was delicious, but the texture, tenderness and richness of the beef wasn\u2019t there. There is no substitution to slow cooking, which is what is needed. And at the end, after  all the corrections, it ended up taking just as much time.",
