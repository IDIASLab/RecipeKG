I never use oil with it as it is an oily fish to begin with. This time I decided to poach the fish using 1/2 c water 1/2 wine some sliced onion & tarragon. Only took 5 minutes and poaching leaves NO fishy odor in the house. I made my salad bed with romaine lettuce and added fresh mushrooms (why saute them?) avocado and grape tomatoes. (Had no feta or would have it it too)To save time I used a little of Paul Newman's Lite Honey Mustard Dressing. Wow! What a fantastic salad. Next time I think I'll add some red pepper and a handful of blueberries.",
