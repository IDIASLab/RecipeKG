I was leery of using a slow cooker because to me a slow cooker meal is usually overcooked and is smelly. But I trudged on and made the recipe as directed so I could give it a fair review. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding parsnips my store was out. I put this on to cook at midnight so it would be ready by lunchtime. When I woke up the house smelled amazing. This recipe took all of the 12 hours stated and tasted pretty darn good. I'm not sure brisket is something I want to work with often but I was glad to have the opportunity to work with bison and this cut of meat. This definitely had good flavor and my son thought it was awesome.",

I have to say that the flavor of the root vegetables adds a great flavor to the meat of the bison especially with it's low fat content of 2%. however I think the beer amount was too low I followed the receipt cooking at 325 F and the moisture was almost gone from the pot at the 8 hour mark. I didn't do anything about it because it was too late but I think it needed at least twice the amount of the beer with probably a cup or two of beef broth. my experiment could have been a lot better but the idea is great and remarkable the more you make it better you get at it. I added less than a cup of dried apricots (dark-brown color not the orange ones which had sulfur added to them to maintain the color) and It wasn't that much present in the taste of the meat...",

Since I've made bison stew many times with the same beer and it tastes great I feel like it comes down to the apricots ruining the taste of the whole dish for me.
