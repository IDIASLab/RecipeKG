I didn't have cream of muchroom soup so I used cream of potato which actually gave this a really nice hearty flavor. For the noodles and processed cheese I used a box of velveta shells and cheese and it did the trick wonderfully. I also omitted the green pepper as I don't have any and my kids wouldn't eat it anyway. This is a keeper strictly for \"in a pinch\" but it lacks ebough flavor to keep it in my recipe book for good.",
