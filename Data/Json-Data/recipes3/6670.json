Instead of chicken broth, I use a strong mushroom broth, and then toss a dozen sliced creminis in with the onions to sautee.  Don't be shy with your broth and fat in this dish - it's where most of the flavor comes from.  One note on the instructions:  The way I was taught, you dry-roast the kasha in a hot pan for a few minutes, then bring water/broth to a boil BEFORE adding the kasha.  This way it doesn't get mushy.",
