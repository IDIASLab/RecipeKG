It's healthy and VERY good.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an easier way to cook pumpkin for pie.  Slash three slices in the pumpkin, put in the oven on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 until knife inserts easily.  Then let cool, cut in half, and scoop out seeds.  Then scoop out flesh and process.  It's THE best way to cook pumpkin and preserves the most vitamins.  If you want to roast the seeds cut a lid, remove the seeds, and cook the same. Cooked pumpkins are much easier to slice and work with than raw, which are as hard as mount rushmore!  \r\n\r\n",

I strained the pumpkin in cheesecloth which made the pie perfect. I did not use the spices in the recipe since more then a few commented it was bland I simply used 2tsp of pumpkin spice and it turned out just the right spice. I thought it was perfectly sweet with the honey. Also 55 minutes with foil around crust edge was perfect. It made two whole 9in pies for me. A must keep recipe THANK YOU!",

                "reviewBody": "nothing like fresh pumpkin pie. My best tip is to Microwave the fresh pumpkin by piercing it a few times with a serving fork or something long and sharp. place pumpkin in a plate because it can ooze. for a large pumpkin 10 on high minutes per pound works great. If you microwave 2 smaller ones together it gets tricky with time you will need to experiment. cook til skin is soft and impressionable. LET COOL before scooping out seeds (save 'em to roast and salt and put in candy dishes) or scooping out the meet. the pumpkin will be much easier/less messy to deal with when cooled. Second hint: cover fluting on your pie crust with file or aluminum rings throughout baking. that temp. is high they will burn. I find that it manages to brown through the foil but if not remove foil last 5-7 minutes of baking. yummy! Oh also try serving with CARMEL CINAMON ice cream (or carmel ice cream sprinkiled with cinnamon yummy plus.",
