What's the point?\" Then I tasted it and promise you that this will be my go to pumpkin pie for the holidays. No one noticed it was eggless or dairy free. It sets just like a regular pie. It tastes rich and creamy just like your mom's pumpkin pie. I used firm silken tofu and coconut sugar because I couldn't find vegan white sugar. After turning down the temperature it only needed 40 minutes in the oven. An easy fool-proof decadent guilt-free pie. Excellent recipe. Thank you.",

But I haven't eaten it in years and this recipe looked easy enough. Like another reviewer I used firm silken tofu and coconut sugar. But instead of the spices recommended I used a tablespoon of my homemade pumpkin spice. It took a little longer to bake after turning the temperature down but my oven is often like that. And I used a crust from frozen so it wasn't fully baked through. HOWEVER this was delicious. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone had two slices. Can't wait to make this again",
