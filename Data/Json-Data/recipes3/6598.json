This was delicious and flavorful, and I didn't find the wine flavor to be too strong at all (maybe it's the type of wine I used, sauvignon blanc). A definite keeper!",

I did not have mushrooms or much time so I made the recipe a \"one step\" by sauteing the onion and garlic in the oil then I added the spinach (all I had was frozen) then the quinoa. I then added all of the liquid ingredients and thyme (all I had was dried). I also didn't have any goat cheese or other crumbled cheese for that matter so left the cheese off all together. This was our first time to have quinoa and it was great. The kids loved it! Even the one that doesn't like spinach loved it and had seconds! It was a great side dish with our dinner of talapia and fruit. Thanks for the recipe will definitely make again!",

Absolutely amazing - can't wait to make it for my mother-in-law who's vegetarian and I'm always looking for new things to make for her. The only alterations for me were using a whole (small) red onion more garlic and I diced an under-ripe tomato and added it to the end of the quinoa before the mushrooms went in and Feta instead of Goat cheese. We'll be having this again soon (and looking for more Quinoa recipes in the meantime!) Thanks SO much for introducing us to this wonderful food!",

It needed more oomph for that; perhaps some roasted red peppers and something crunchy to sink your teeth into perhaps some pecans or even water chestnuts. As a side dish however it would be very good. I squeezed some lemon juice on each serving and I thought that brightened the flavor quite a bit. It is not the most attractive dish to ever hit the plate either which is another reason to add some red peppers for color.",
