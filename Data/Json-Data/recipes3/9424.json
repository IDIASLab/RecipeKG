        "description": "My family and I have always loved these during the pumpkin season. Over the years I've come to tweak it to our tastes. More flavor and a little more spice, but NOT overdoing it. I hope you love this as much as we do. Trust me on the seasonings. Seems to be a lot, but SO very worth it. I usually get quite a bit out of these with everyone just passing them around. You can make a bigger batch of these (which I have done many times). Just adjust the ingredients to the amount of pumpkin seeds you have. This a great snack for parties or family night.",
