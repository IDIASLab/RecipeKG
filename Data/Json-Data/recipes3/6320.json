I served this to for a party a while back and the feedback was amazing. This was a bunch of twenty-something year olds and by the end of the night I had given directions on how to get the recipe at least a dozen times. I did make a slight change. I left out the chopped mint on accident as I was rushed to get it out on the table. However I'm not a huge fan of mint anyways and the salsa still went over amazingly. Also I used Tostito's Hint-of-Lime Tortilla Chips and I think they complimented it nicely. One final remark: Don't skimp on the Red Onion or the Jalapeno. I don't handle spice very well but if you de-seed the jalapeno well it won't be an issue and the two especially the red onion give the salsa a necessary \"bite\" to it that you need in order for it to be a salsa and not too fruity. Huge rave and will definitely be using this for parties more often. Make sure to make it the night of if you want it chunky otherwise it gets liquidy within a few hours.",

Well except for my son and he LOVED it. Perect combo of fruitiness and spicyness. I quadrupled the recipe and ended up not having quite enough mango but it didn't matter. And I had to use canned pineapple because no fresh was available. I used the exact recipe and at first it tasted a little salty. But by the next day it was perfect. I think it could have even used more jalapenos. This will be on my go to list from now on.",
