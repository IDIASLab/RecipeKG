The batter was thick - which by itself is not a problem - but it hardly rose at all. The muffins were way too dense. We bake almost exclusively with whole wheat flour so it wasn't the whole wheat texture that was getting to me. Our usual pumpkin muffins are light and fluffy despite being 100% whole wheat. I have a suspicion that the recipe should call for baking powder rather than baking soda as there is really nothing acidic in the batter to activate the baking soda. I checked the recipe 3 or 4 times because I just couldn't believe it was calling for baking soda but I in the end I didn't go with my gut and just followed the recipe as-is. If I make this again I would definitely substitute baking powder for baking soda. The flavors were very nice but they can't quite overcome the rest of it. They're not bad enough to throw out but definitely a big disappointment.",

I also subbed 1/2 cup of the sugar for raw honey for added health benefits and lower sugar (mixed the honey in with the wet ingredients ) and skipped the topping. After 25 minutes at 350 these were golden moist and delicious. I think next time I'll skip the sugar altogether and just use honey.",
