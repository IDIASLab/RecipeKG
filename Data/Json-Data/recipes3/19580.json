I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of broth and for some extra flavoring I used more regular chili powder and a few dashes of hot chili powder because my husband likes a little kick! I used 2 cans of garlic basil and oregano flavored tomatoes and only canned green beans and corn for the vegetables. I decided to add rotini pasta as suggested in another review and my family and I decided this made the chili so much better. If you do add the pasta you will have to add about a cup or two of water. It was delicious and I will definitely make this again!",

I did what some reviewers did by browning your cubed chicken with olive oil lots of garlic garlic salt and pepper. Also I only used one can of chicken broth and added one cup of water. Then during the last 10 minutes of simmering I added half a box of rotini pasta. Turned out perfect and delicious! Thank you!",

I fried the chicken in light fajita seasoning and fresh garlic. I used only green beans and corn. I used regular ro tel. I also fried some fresh garlic with the onions and pepper and used a TBS of chili powder. Even better if you shred some jalepeno jack on top. BOTH my children 5 and 2 ate this!!! THEY ATE ALL THE VEGGIES! Trust me...a must have recipe for any family! Thank you for sharing!",

For the veggies I used some leftover baby carrots and green beans I also added some fresh garlic and salt and pepper. I upped the chili powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons. I also threw in a handful of tricolor pasta for the last half hour. This was really really good. I think maybe next time I will add the extra can of cream of chicken that other reviewers used. I really have no complaints. My kids and I have been picking at it all day. This is a must have for your recipe box.",
