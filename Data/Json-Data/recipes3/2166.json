I reduced the cream cheese to 8 oz, and increased the mayo to 3 4ths of a cup.  I squirted lemon juice on the crab to eliminate any fishy taste ( i do this to all my seafood).  Then I added 2 shakes of cayanne and 3 tablespoons of horseradish.  I baked it for 15 minutes, and then topped it with shredded cheddar and monteray jack cheese and baked it until the cheese was lightly golden.  With these chages it is a def. 5 star recipe.  I think this is a great starter crab dip.  Thanks for posting.",

Well, this is one of them.  I did everything that the recipe called for, but I did add a little sour cream and some sharp chedder cheese in the mixture.  I didn't have any Old Bay Seasoning either so I just used a little Tony Chachere's seasoning salt (it's a Louisiana thang, baby).  I also sprinkled the top of it with a little more cheese once I put it in the pan.  I served it with an Italian loaf that I toasted in the oven for just a little bit to make the bread a little crispy...but don't keep it in too long are the bread will be too hard.  Always make sure that you grease the bottom of the pan before you bake it......or just simply spray it with some non-stick cooking spray.  Clean-up's a breeze and this dip didn't last long at all.  To be honest, I ate it all myself cause I didn't want to share.  I'll share the next one, but this was just too darn good.............FOR REAL!!!",

It tastes like mayo. and the bowl gets soggy. so I changed it..lol I used 3 6oz cans of crabmeat 1 cup sour cream 2 8oz pkgs of cream cheese I sauteed 1 half of a white onion with garlic and a tbsp of butter. added all spice and garlic powder to taste. The secret is adding 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese grated. If I did anything wrong I didn't add enough salt. I also dashed on some lemon pepper before I served it. I served it cold with Seattle sourdough bread toasted. MMMMMMmmm It was amazing! also used ritz crackers. It was gone in 5 mins and there were only 6 of us.:):)",
