I chose not to peel my eggplant, but the skins did look like burnt pieces in my meatballs. I also used 1 tsp dried basil in place of the fresh.  I saut\u00e9ed the onion and eggplant for about 20 minutes, placed in a blender to make a paste, then added the seasonings, cheese and panko. I got 12 meatballs using 1/8 cup scoop.  I prepped them 4 hours ahead of time, placed in the fridge on a cookie sheet until I was ready to bake.  Let come to room temp while the oven preheated.  Baked for 30 minutes turning every 6 minutes. We thought they were good, but a bit flavorless.  So next time I will adjust the seasonings to our tastes.  I served it on a bed of pasta with pasta sauce.  I will make this recipe again, thanks for sharing!",

I added one egg to the room temperature mixture before adding a good amount of parmesan cheese and panko crumbs and then threw them in the oven and flipped every 10 minutes till all sides were browned nicely.  Once they were done i let them cook for 10 minutes in my tomato sauce and served over spaghetti.  Thanks for this recipe!  Saved my meal.",

When I mixed the eggplant onion mixture with bread crumbs (I just pur\u00e9ed two slices of light whole wheat bread) And Parmesan at first I didn t think it was going to stick together but I pressed it together as I mixed and it was the perfect consistency. I turned the balls every 10 minutes. Done in 30 minutes. Thanks!",
