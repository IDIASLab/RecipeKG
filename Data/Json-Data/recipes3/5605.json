It is great for people fighting diabetes cancer or just want good general health. In the recipe I forgot that you should add about 2-3 minced garlic cloves with the onions. You can use chicken thighs shredded chicken or mixed pieces for a more rich stew or go without the meat and add more beans. Add more veggies of various colors. It is a great stew for fall/winter!",

I think that 48 oz is way too much chicken broth if I make it again I will cut back the broth by at least one third maybe even half. I also pulled the chicken out of the pot after simmering for about 15 minutes because it was more than done and I did not want to over-cook it (35 minutes total cook time is way too long for diced boneless chicken). I added the chicken back in after the vegetables were done. Next time I may also consider using chicken thighs whole (with the skin and bone) to provide a richer flavor. It just lacked \"oomph\" but with a little work this could be an excellent dish.",

First I added about five carrots and an extra zucchini two small potatoes and a large onion instead. I also added about a half cup of raisins. I didn't add the chicken because my mom's vegan but instead halved a couple cornish hens, seasoned them with the same seasonings used in the recipe, and roasted them in the oven. This made for a more pleasing presentation, I think. I increased the amount of seasonings probably by at least 30% and the extra veggies helped soak up a lot of the liquid so it wasn't too soupie. For nutritional reasons my mother suggested adding a bit of kale so I'll probably try that next time. All in all a delightful and healthy meal.",
