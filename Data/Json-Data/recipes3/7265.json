Since we've returned home we have missed the delicious dishes from Sweden. My husband bought some fresh Chanterelles recently and he wasn't sure what we should do with them so I came to allrecipes.com and found this unique recipe. The finished product holds up nicely (like a meatloaf) and has a wonderful flavor. I am giving it 4 stars because the salt was just a little over powering. The ham probably adds more salt to the dish so maybe try cutting the salt down to just 1 tsp. I will post a photo as soon as I download them from my camera. Thank you for a delicious recipe.",

This is a recipe for the fresh ones and this recipe didn't disappoint at all! This is fantastically delicious and I'm so glad you submitted it! If I could give more than 5 stars I would!! Thanks!",

I didn't have shallots so I did 1/2 an onion 1 tsp of dried parsley instead of fresh 1/2 tsp of salt just regular lunchmeat ham slices and I could only find dried chanterelle mushrooms and only 1/2 of what the recipe called for so I used fresh portabellas. Everything tastes so good except for the dried chanterelles which I did soak ahead of time to 'rehydrate' if you will and they just tasted really off. I will make it again and if I can't find 'fresh' chanterelles I'll do all ports again. Overall great flavor and something different to make for a change thank you:)",

Salt is the same by weight but not volume. I use Morton Kosher which is less dense therefore less salt by weight. I cut the amount is salt by1/3. I also used unsalted butter. Before I packed the mold I took a bit of the mixture and cooked it in the microwave. I could have added more salt at that point but it was good and the ham was also going to add salt.
