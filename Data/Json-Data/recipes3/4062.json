I was looking for a quiche recipe that would have good flavor and that I could substitute a pie crust for hash browns and I found one that had both! Sweet!!  I definitely liked the hash brown crust instead of a regular pie crust.  It was far less work and tasted much better (in my opinion.  I have never been too keen on pie crusts- making them or the flavor of them).  The over all flavor was yummy and good.  I added a clove of garlic to the meat as I cooked it to give it some extra flavor and it all turned out wonderfully!! this recipe is definitely a keeper. :)",
