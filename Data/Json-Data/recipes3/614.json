Best of both worlds for those people who really like the top of the stuffing (with the crust) but not the bottom (with the mush). People really seemed to enjoy them even the teenagers. I made my biscuits and corn bread the night before let them cool and crumbled them into a large bowl. Covered loosely with a tea towel and set on the counter to dry overnight. Then mixed everything up in the morning. This was a really easy recipe. I did increase the seasonings a bit as we like food with a little more flavor in our family. I would recommend this to anyone.",

The cornbread crumbles nicely but biscuits are much denser and they might benefit from a quick run through the food processor before being mixed in next time.",

It was like Thanksgiving dinner all wrapped up into one neat little package. Huge hit with my kids. I already had biscuits made from \"heart healthy\" Bisquick so I used those and I used \"No Chicken Chicken Broth\" and Earth Balance spread in place of the turkey stock and butter and omitted the mushrooms (kids) and they were amazing. I also upped the spices just because we like a lot of flavor. I'll be making cornbread and biscuits just to make these!",

I wasn't sure how long they needed to bake since it wasn't stated in the recipe but after about 35 minutes they patties still weren't brown. I turned the oven on broil for a few minutes just to get slightly brown and have a little crunch on the top. The patties did not stay together well after they were cooked either. I had to be very careful when moving them to the platter just to keep them together. The flavor was ok but I think they would have benefited from some fresh sage.
