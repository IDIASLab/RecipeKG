The trick to the hashbrowns is to thaw and drain well, then squeeze in a paper towel to remove all the moisture. Add what seasonings you want, press into the pie plate, and bake for about 25 min. or until they start to brown. Then add whatever other toppings you want. I use deep dish pie plates, so I use 5 or 6 eggs. We love ham, green onions, mushrooms and pepper jack cheese. Try this, you will like what you can do with it.",

First I fried the hashbrowns in butter for about 10-15 mins then mixed in some onion and garlic powder along with some pepper then pressed them into the dish.   I used 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk. Added 1/4 cup of diced green peppers.  I also used 1/4 pound of bacon cut into 1\" pieces, remember to fry bacon first! Turned out fantastic!",

Remember to let quiche sit about 5 min. before slicing.  Husband and I both liked this and will make it again.  Thanks.",
