I was a little worried that they wouldn't have a lot of flavor but once they were grilled they had an amazing taste. Mine were a little watery (because I used the entire package of tofu) so I added some crushed Triscuits to soak up the extra water and they turned out great. I will make this recipe over and over again! Thanks AmieO!",
