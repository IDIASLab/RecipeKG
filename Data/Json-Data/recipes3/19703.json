Any steak should be rested for at least 5 minutes after cooking to redistribute the juices. If you cut it you just are letting the juices run out and drying out your steak. Use your finger to test for firmness. Very soft/squishy is rare well done is very firm.",

We don't usually marinade rib eye steaks because they are so tender anyway - but this is a nice change. Excellent Flavor !! And Oh Sooo Tender ! UPDATE - we never use to marinate ribeyes but we use this all the time now - the flavor is so good and it is so tender / just cooking steaks with seasoning just isn't the same.\nThank you for sharing this recipe. Awesome !!!",
