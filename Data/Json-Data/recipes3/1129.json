This is only the second time I found a healthy recipe that I didn't have to tweak to make it taste better.  Also, with most smoothies, you taste one dominant flavor but this was like a flavor explosion in my mouth. First, I tasted orange, then the spicyness from the ginger, then it finished with an ice creamy taste - but none of the flavors were overpowing. I will definitely be making this all the time.  Thank you LIsa for sharing.",
