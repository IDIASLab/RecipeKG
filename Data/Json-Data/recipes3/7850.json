Mushrooms carry so much moisture and they just filled the bottom of the pan with water.  I think if I make these again I will use a rack in the bottom of the pan to keep the mushrooms from the water.  My boyfriend thinks the recipe is worth 4 stars, I said 3.  I will use this again with some changes.",

                "reviewBody": "I don't know why cottage cheese is used instead of Ricotta cheese.  Cottage cheese to me is more of a substitute for cream cheese (same type of flavor).  I used Ricotta cheese and it tasted wonderful.  Also, after reading another review, I tried baking this on a rack to drain the mushrooms.  It didn't work because I believe the mushrooms need to be on the pan for the full heat of the pan in order to cook.  I wound up putting them in the microwave for a minute each because the mushrooms weren't cooked and then put them under the broiler with the sauce & cheese as indicated but this time without that rack.  They did release a lot of juice, but I just poured it off.  It was fine.  \n\n1 more thing: if you change the serving amt, do not change the eggs. i.e. if you want 6 servings, the \"calculator\" will triple all the ingredients.  Do not put in 3 eggs.  You still only need 1 egg.  When I make regular lasagna I only use 1 egg regardless of whether I use 1, 2 or 3 lbs of ricotta.  It's just there for the texture.  3 eggs would be FAR too much.\n\nThanks for a great alternative to using pasta.  My neighbor is disabled and I cook for her twice a month as a treat and a favor.  She is on a gluten free diet & I was getting tired of just baking chickens with sides of rice & veggies.  What a wonderful alternative this was.  She LOVED it!!  Thank you for posting it.  Without the cottage cheese, I rate this 5 stars.  It's a very delicious recipe!!!",
