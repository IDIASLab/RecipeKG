                "reviewBody": "Ajiaco is from the state of Cundinamarca (Bogota), Colombia. After preparing the traditional recipe with the guidance of my in-laws, there are a few touches that this recipe lacks. Fist, you should use papa criolla (small yellow potatoes). And a combination of another potato (regular baking potatoes). Second, the corn should be corn on the cob and not loose pieces of corn. Each bowl should be served with a small cob in the bottom. Third, the avocado is not added to the broth, but served on the side. Fourth, you should also use the herb called guascas. These maybe hard to find, but try looking at an ethnic foods store. I had to bring mine back from Colombia with me. Fifth, sour cream is not a traditional topping. Capers and creama are. Usually you can find the creama by the Mexican cheeses in the US. It might be called creama Mexicana. Those should be all the alterations you will need to have an authentic Colombian Ajiaco. This recipe is a good base, but it would need these alterations to be authentic.",

Sour cream is used usually with mexican recipes not colombian media crema (table cream) is the right one; & like other reviewers mencioned there is a bunch of important ingredients missing (specially the guascas!!!)..cant be compared with the great flavor of a real ajiaco & i should know since im Colombian...by the way other important ingredients that are missing are: -arracacha (yellow cassava) that along with the papa criolla & papa de a\u00f1o o sabanera (the equivalent would be a white potato that will melt baking potato i guess) will give thickness to the ajiaco without anything EVER being mashed!! -arveja verde (green peas) -yucca (will also help thicken the ajiaco but just a bit is added chopped very well so it can melt) Other modifications I would def. make are: -the chicken shouldnt be cooked that long;only about 20 mins & is added when the ajiaco is ready & about to be served. -The corn (cob not just canned corn) is cut into pieces about as big as you index finger and is added along with the potatoes so it can cook properly and give flavor. - The yucca & arracacha are also added with potaoes & corn. -Let ajiaco cook on medium heat for about 30 mins cilantro is added along with guascas when cooking about 10 mins before it finishes cooking -When serving top with crema & dont add the avocados to the soup but leave as a side along with capers & white rice.",

For Crema you can also use thick cream and the capers are optional always served on a side for those that do not like them. You do not need to mash the potatoes since this soup needs to simmer for a long time to let some of the potatoes to melt and there is need for 3 kinds of potatoes: Yellow Red and Criolla this last one and guascas can be found at latin stores (frozen criolla potatoes and dried guascas)",
