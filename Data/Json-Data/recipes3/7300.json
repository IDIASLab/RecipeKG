Then dip the steamed Yucas in a solution of fresh squeezed lime, salt (go lightly), onion powder, garlic powder, or chopped fresh garlic, chipotle chile powder, etc... (whatever you think tastes good) and then broil them real quick on a cookie sheet using no oil.  Once browned flip them over and brown the other side.  They will end up soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Yumm... and no fried oils! Heart Healthy! Plant Strong!  PS. Somebody stated that they eat the skin. Everything I have ever read states that the skin is toxic.",

I've only tried this recipe with the sweet variety. I've never seen bitter in the market but if its not labeled I ask the produce staff to make sure its sweet. Also the skin contains a mild poison so these fries should not be prepared with the skin. I made these fries with garlic -- added slices of garlic to the boiling water and lots of minced garlic was tossed in with the fries yum! Also I seasoned the fries with chipolte pepper and coarse sea salt. This is now my new recipe for garlic fries. Its a great replacement for starchy potatoes.",

My fiance can't eat nightshades so he really misses traditional potato fries, I made these the other day and they were a hit!  I did some research online and found the best way to cook is to boil until just tender (I used water and threw in a bouillon cube for flavor) and then drained, let cool and cut like steak fries, coated with Olive oil spray and tossed in a mix of onion powder, salt, pepper and some Nutritional yeast - baked until crispy turning once or twice.
