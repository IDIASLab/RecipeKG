Based on earlier reviews, I used 1/8 c dried Italian seasoning instead of the oregano and parsley, and two 14.5 oz cans of peeled diced tomatoes instead of fresh simply because it's what I had handy, and it was still marvelous.  I imagine it would taste even better with fresh ingredients!  The feta on top was a great finishing touch.\n\nI may try this with other meats, like diced chicken breast, just to see how it turns out because I liked this so much.  Perhaps I'll also try it with mozzarella instead of feta.  Serving with noodles is recommended and something I'll try next time also, or make pasta, mix the whole thing up, top with a cheese and turn it into a bake.  Thank you, Rose Ann!",

On the vine tomatoes also added to the already robust flavor. \n\nChanges: I let the tomatoes simmer and reduce slightly and cooked the shrimp(sm/med)in the sauce until pink and ready to serve. This added to the flavor as well as added convenience points. \n\nA staple in my kitchen. :)",

With frozen cooked shrimp keep the flame low & not too long or the shrimp will be tough. Also I only had serrano peppers which wasn't hot enough for us so added some crushed red pepper. Took Henny's advice and stuck it under the broiler to melt feta w/ some mozarella too and three of us loved it over spaghetti. The leftovers were great non-melted too. Thanks for a keeper!",
