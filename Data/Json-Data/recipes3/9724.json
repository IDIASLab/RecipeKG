I cooked two chicken breast, seasoned with garlic, onion and Mediterranean seasonings in my pressure cooker, then used the seasoned broth as my chicken broth. I probably had about three cups of chicken. This was so creamy good and had a very nice flavor. I do think I'd cut the broth down next time to just five cups for a thicker soup base. I also threw the spinach in the last 7 minutes of cooking to keep it from reducing too much. I'd like to try it with more vegetables, but really it was perfectly wonderful with just the spinach.",

I cooked my chicken in some heavy spices, and then deglazed the pan with white wine...adding that to the stock as well.  I added celery and carrots as well as onions.  I'm the only spinach eater in the house, so I added spinach to my bowl and let the heat from the soup wilt it.  Instead of sour cream, I added about 3oz of cream cheese--simply because that was what I had on hand.  All in all, this worked for us--my extremely picky 8 year old ate 2 bowls of it without complaint.  Thanks!!!!",
