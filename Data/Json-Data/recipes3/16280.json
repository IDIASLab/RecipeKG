In the other review it was stated that cooking spray was used instead of oil and the butter was reduced. I did the same thing and I had almost NO flavor. That was obviously not the recipe submitter's fault and so my rating is not based on that. The part of the problem for me that caused the three star rating is that I think the breading process is missing the flour step. I did the best I could to get the chicken coated but the egg didn't want to cling to the chicken and therefore the breadcrumbs didn't cling either. As a result I only used about half the breadcrumbs. Since that's where the spices were only half the spices actually got used which is probably another reason why my chicken was bland. I also had parts where the egg did stick but the breadcrumbs fell off leaving cooked egg on the outside of the chicken. So I wound up with a thin somewhat patchy crust and not much in the way of flavor. The recipe submitter says you can tailor the spices to suit your individual tastes and I guess that's really what should be done here. Also if I do try this one again I'll definitely coat the chicken with flour before it goes into the egg.",
