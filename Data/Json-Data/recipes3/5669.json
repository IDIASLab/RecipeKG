I knew it would be good (anything with a whole block of Velveeta Cheese is bound to be good!) but I made this for a Christmas get-together and my guests couldn't leave it alone. Everyone ate so much of it that we had to postpone dinner! The recipe makes quite a bit so if you're only making it for a few people you might want to pare it down a bit. I added a can of crab meat that I had in the cupboard and it couldn't have been better! You can really play with the ingredients add more green onion other seafood or whatever you want. This dip cannot be beat if you are a seafood lover!",

I added twice the Velveeta, half a pound more crawfish,cut the crawfish into thirds so that it went further, and then stuffed it into hollowed out pistolettes.  I then slathered the pistolettes with butter and baked at 350 until lightly browned.  Absolutely fabulous!!  This can be served as a appetizer, side bread, or even a main dish!  Definitely a crowd pleaser!",
