I've made no changes to the recipe except to add about 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips. The second time I made it, I had only 2 bananas so I added an eyeballed amount of applesauce, approximately the same as a mushed banana, in place of the third banana. There was no texture change and only a very slight flavor change to the finished banana bread; it was still very good. Today when I make it, I'll have to do the same thing, since again I have only 2 bananas. \n\nWe live at about 6,300 feet in elevation, and I made NO high altitude adjustments. The gluten-free flour I use is Bob's Red Mill.",
