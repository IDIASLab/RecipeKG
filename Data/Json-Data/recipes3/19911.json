I also doubled the gravy, and used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can golden mushroom.  That really helped keep the dish from having that \"some kind of meat covered w/cream of mushroom soup\" taste.  I also sauteed some fresh mushrooms in the pan I'd cooked the pork in and added them to the soup mixture.  I added some extra garlic and just a couple dashes of cayenne.  I cooked the chops for 20/20.....needed less cooking time I think cause I'd browned them so well.  Turned out wonderful!",

I did not bake them for as long as the recipie called b/c I ran out of time.  They were done after 35 min and everything tatsted great, very tender and juicy.  The sauce textrue was \"just right\", not too watery and not too chunky.  One suggestion I have is to make double the sauce if you like to dip the meat because you'll wish you had more after you try it.  I substituted the white wine with Vermouth, and next time I am thinking of adding more of the Vermouth or white wine and taking away some of the milk.  This I think will strenghthen the taste of the sauce to be even better as the wine/Vermouth seems to play a big part in the taste of the whole meal.  A note of caution: be careful not to burn the pork chops when frying, keep the heat at med/high and check often, I \"saved\" them just in time :).  A+",

I think the breading is just for a little color and flavor.  It was not intended to stay crunchy while being baked in a lot of sauce.  Anyway, I served this with mashed potatoes and asparagus and it was delightful.  Only things I would clarify are that I used Lawry's brand seasoning salt, Chardonnay for the wine, and I only used 4 pork chops with the same amount of gravy in the recipe.  The perfect amount was left to drizzle over the potatoes.  Maybe a little more wine could be added next time.  Thanks again!!",

                "reviewBody": "Breaded pork chops are always a hit with my husband and I've been making pork chops like this for years. I always use Italian style bread crumbs and just eyeball extra seasonings to add like garlic powder, cracked black pepper, dried parsley, Italian seasoning and some grated Parmesan cheese. I always dip my pork chops into the egg/milk mixture then the seasoned bread crumbs and then repeat that procedure (double dipping). This gives the pork a thick breading and keeps it moist while baking. To cut calories and time I spray the bottom of a glass baking dish with Pam, place the breaded pork in (no frying needed) then spray the pork with a little Pam, cook at 350 for 20 minutes, turn and cook for another 25 minutes. They'll come out moist and tender. This recipe has the pork cooking for way too long - it'll dry right out! And, there's nothing worse than dried out pork. I tried the soup mixture over top and well, it was OK.  I poured it over half the chops during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  I think I'll stick to the breaded pork chops without the soup mixture.....",

I followed the recipe, but I did make a few changes........of course.  I followed some others' advice and added golden mushroom with the cream of mushroom.  That, along with the white wine, is the key to this wonderful tasting dish.  I also added some sauteed mushrooms and green onions to the sauce right before I poured it on the chops.  Make sure you use a non-stick cooking spray on the bottom of the pan before you start baking so the coat on the pork chops doesn't stick.  I served this along with the Angel Chicken Pasta recipe I found on here.  It was a very rich meal, but worth every calorie we digested.  Put it like this........I have a cousin who can not stand ANY VEGETABLE KNOWN TO MAN.  You know what...........he had three servings the first night. That was one of the best compliments I could've gotten.  Thank you Dawn for this better than OUTSTANDING RECIPE!!!",

So--using someone's idea of boneless chops, I doused the chops with bottled minced garlic, rubbed them with a bit of Kitchen Bouquet, used sour cream instead of milk, used Lindeman's Chardonnay(an inexpensive but but very good Australian wine, threw in about 1 or 2 T sweet Hungarian paprika, & a lot of fresh, sliced, sauteed mushrooms. Did all that make it any better than the original? Don't know, but I do know it got rave reviews.

I used 2 huge butterfly pork chops (instead of 6). I doubled the sauce-used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 2/3rds cup of white wine (I used Chardonnay) and only used 3/4 cup of milk. I sauteed an onion in a tsp of oil first, then added the gravy mix. Heated that up and topped it over the chops. I also cut down the cooking time-45minutes/30minutes. Turned out increadibly tender. My husband had seconds.",
