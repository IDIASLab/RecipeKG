These baked up nicely at 22 minutes, and the blueberries were evenly distributed throughout the muffin (instead of just falling to the bottom that occasionally will happen).  My husband commented \u201cthe texture\u2019s funny on these.\u201d  I told him I used almond flour, and he said I guess I really prefer just regular flour, and honestly, so do I.  They are very tender, moist, and the blueberries pop with sweetness in your mouth.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
