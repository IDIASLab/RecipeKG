Not sure how these tasted like plastic to the other reviewer? They tasted like frog legs to me and darn good ones at that. I made these along with fried oysters and fried clams for my hubby's birthday dinner and  he said that these stole the show. I preferred them dipped in cocktail sauce but he liked them with the Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce from this site. Thanks for sharing AnimalWhiz!",

We followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using corn oil because that's all we had and they came out nicely. We served them with homemade cocktail sauce and jumped in (see what I've done there?) A squirt of lemon once they came out of the fryer would be good but not necessary. Great recipe and I'll be danged if I don't actually like frog legs!",
