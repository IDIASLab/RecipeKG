A great dish to accompany large, busy meals, as most of the work can be done ahead of time and the asparagus reheated with the tomatoes and garlic at the last minute while the roast (or whatever else) is resting. Also a delicious preparation for green beans in place of the asparagus.",

Add the asparagus tops to the water later, because they need shorter cooking time.    All in all, this is a simple and great recipe for one of the best vegetables in existence: Asparagus!",

I made the asparagus a few days later at home for my boyfriend and I only because it's so much more expensive. It was great with both vegetables! I did add extra tomato and garlic to the recipe just because I wanted to make a more dramatic flavor, but I loved loved loved this dish! Yum!",
