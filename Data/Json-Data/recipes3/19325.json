The next day I baked the chicken at 350 for 30 minutes. In the saucepan I put the sour cream from the cooked chicken 1/4 c chicken broth a can of corn a can of black beans & a 10 oz package of frozen spinach. Served over a bed of whole grain rice.

Great smoky flavor but just beware this has some intense heat. I did add frozen corn and green beans to the recipe and reduced the spinach by 1/2. The kids and I used extra sour cream at the table to cut the fire. I also made cornbread which was a nice addition. Oh as another reviewer mentioned the time under the broiler wasn't nearly long enough to cook the chicken... I ended up baking it for an additional 30 minutes at 350.",

Best advice in other reviews was to use corn instead of spinach -- the corn and sour cream sauce really makes this whole dish come alive and I normally won't even touch sour cream. We served this with refried beans & shredded cheese which were perfect to cool down your mouth between bites! Definitely try this recipe; even if you want to cut way down on the peppers the flavor will be great.",

It was my first time cooking with chipotle peppers and I had know idea jalapenos could be that spicy. Fire. I will definitely try this recipe again but even as a spice-lover who asks for everything extra hot I may use only half a can of peppers or less next time. Also I used frozen corn instead of spinach. This gave it a sweetness that made the chipotle taste yum. I see corn more often in Mexican dishes so it made it a little more authentic-looking. It was very pretty with the yellow corn red peppers and orangy sour cream sauce. Try this but watch out for the heat factor!",

I took the advise of it being spicy and knocked off the seeds (good advise). I also used a frozen box EACH of spinach green beans & corn with a bit extra broth. I put the mixture from broiling (including chicken) in the pan with all this and simmered on stovetop for awhile. This seemed to use it all up in the just right proportion so I think using just the spinach might not be enough for the sauce. But I don't think you can go too wrong no matter how you make it because this is so wonderful for people who love a smokey spicy flavor. Next time I will add cornbread and leave the corn out of the main dish. Thanks so much for this EASY EASY recipe! Oh yes I only had time to marinate an hour and it was still great.",
