I only roughly followed the recipe and didn't use parmesan; it is still very tasty. I also cooked the leaves, mostly separated from the stems, on the stove; it is a bit like kale (seasoned these with some salt & pepper). The bases of the stems have some of the same flavor as the bulb; I chopped those up into small pieces and use the same olive oil + salt & pepper + garlic mix to season and bake those. All good stuff, thanks for the recipe!",

I cut mine in cubes since that is how we always eat them but they took just over 30 minutes to bake. I think it s because I used a thick glass baking dish so it probably took longer to heat through. I will definitely make this again but next time I will add more garlic. I also added some frozen chopped parsley to give the kohlrabi a nicer presentation.
