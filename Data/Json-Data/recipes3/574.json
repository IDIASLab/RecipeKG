I followed some of others' suggestions: Mixed 1/2 tsp. minced garlic with Healthy Reqst. cream of mushroom soup (instead of cream of chix) and put them in a blender with the white wine. Then I lightly sprinkled seasoned salt poultry seasoning and pepper on chix breasts (only used seasoned salt on one side vs. both sides) and tenderized the chix breasts with a Jaccard tenderizer (has 10 little knives in it). I poured a little of the soup mixture in the bottom of the casserole dish and sprinkled 1/4 cup diced onions on the soup. Then I placed the chix breasts in the dish poured the remaining soup mixture on top and sprinkled 1/4 cup diced onions on top. Baked it for 1/2 hr. took it out of the oven spooned the spinach dip on top and baked it for another 1/2 hr. It looked beautiful and tasted wonderful -- it's definitely a \"company\" dish! It IS a little soupy but worked well with the linguine I served. A definite keeper!",
