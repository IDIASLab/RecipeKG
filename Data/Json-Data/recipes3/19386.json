I make this with the recipe on this site: \"The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies\" and it is just fantastic!  If you aren't a big fan of sweet stuff, however, I would suggest halving this recipe-- this really makes way more than necessary for that recipe.  If you are a big fan of sweet stuff, however-- glop it on!  I seriously suggest putting in the shortening, then slowly adding the powdered sugar about half a cup at a time.  Once it starts clumping up, add the milk/ etc, then add more sugar if you want to make it a bit thicker.  I've found that if it gets too clumpy, it won't dissolve the clumps, and you have to smooth it out with a spatula, which takes forever.",

Just keep it a scant measure of the shortening, and whip it up real well and this icing is fantastic. Not only that, but it held up well enough that I could pack these up and pass them out.

I used unsalted butter instead of shortening though, it gives a much better flavor to the icing.  The one time I used shortening the icing dried fairly quickly and I was able to put all the cookies in layers (with tinfoil in between) within 15 minutes of icing them.  If you want to add sprinkles or anything to the top of the icing be sure to do that right away or they won't stick!  If you use butter, the cookies will stick together if you stack them but there's no trans fats!",
