        "description": "This has become our favorite fish recipe. Besides being very tasty, it is a quick and easy recipe. We use black cod (US name) or sablefish. Pollock can be used. A while ago I found a similar recipe in a grocery store; it was good but need some tweaking. Basically I toned down the tomato topping, increased the Parmesan, decreased the mustard sauce and modified the cook time. In our opinion these changes made a better balance of flavors. Despite the four serving count, we found that one pound of black cod is just about the right amount for the two of us. Serve with Pinot Gris and French bread.",

I only had grated parmesan on hand, and it tasted \"grate\"  haha (next time I will use shredded).  The only change we would make is to put in a bit less of the raw red onion, as it carried a pretty strong flavor.  Also, I think there was a misprint in the recipe... it should start out with the fish going in the oven skin-side UP, not DOWN.  Then flip the fish over part-way through the baking process and add the mustard-butter sauce, then back in the oven skin-side DOWN.  \nOverall, a definite keeper recipe!",

This will definitely make a return to our table. I list the substitutions made to encourage anyone else to try this recipe even if you don't have everything in your cupboard or for food allergies etc. The Tomato Topping actually became a carrot and beet mixture (both from canned and then roughly smashed). The Pinot Gris became Pinot Noir (the only wine we had). The fresh minced red onion got roasted (we don't like raw onion). The cod became pollock and my husband noted the pollock had a nice texture to it. He couldn t tell it had wine in the topping - and he didn't recognize the mostly carrot base - thinking the topping was made from tomatoes. Anyone would love this dish who loves a quick dish with a combination of veggies and white fish. Thanks for sharing!",
