Because I like my salsa a little \"wetter\", I threw half of the diced tomatoes in the blender with half of the onion, one of the diced red peppers, half of the cilantro and the garlic. I pulsed it until it was the consistancy I was looking for, then folded the contents of the blender into the remaining salsa ingredients. Very tasty--one of the better homemade salsa's I've made! UPDATED REVIEW: I've made this twice now and I just can't get enough of it. I used some of this today in both a chicken and rice recipe AND a black bean/corn \"salad\" and it was fantastic!",
