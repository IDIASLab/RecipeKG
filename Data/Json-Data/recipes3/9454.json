However I followed the recipe exactly; except for cooking it an extra 7 minutes because the middle was still a bit mushy. I'm sure this is my error but it didn't ever rise properly and the outside was over-cooked (but not burnt) while the inside took longer. I was careful not to over mix and I most definitely didn't leave anything out nor adapt or substitute anything. How do you get it to rise? And how do I keep it from cooking unevenly? I used a 12\" cast iron. Maybe a smaller one?",
