It was perfect with the Boston lettuce small tomatoes roasted corn green onions avocado and corn chip salad.",

                "reviewBody": "Sorry but the measurements are really off in this recipe and what you end up with a thin/watery dressing that will not emulsify and falls off your salad greens. The standard salad dressing ratio is 3 to 1. Also understand that if you start adding a lot more olive oil your fat grams will increase. I'm giving this 3 stars based solely on taste not the consistency. I do like the layers of flavor that the bright lime juice and the fresh cilantro bring to the vinaigrette but proportions need to be modified to reach the right vinaigrette consistency. Very \"Mexican\" tasting to me but I can see using this on a bean salad pasta salad or maybe even drizzled on some nachos. It has possibilities other than just a salad dressing. Maybe even add a little dijon mustard to help the emulsion.",
