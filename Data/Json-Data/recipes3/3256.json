I still gave this recipe 5 stars because it is SO good using regular cheese...my husband said he could eat it that way every day.  Too bad the regular cheese makes it so fattening.  It does need added salt and a good bit of pepper when not using the processed cheese, but it's well worth it.",

This is sensational. In fact I would run out and buy summer squash in the winter to make this recipe. My husband loved it! Thanks so much for a great addition to my squash recipe collection.
