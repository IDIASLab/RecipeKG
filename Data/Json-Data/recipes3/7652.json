Good way to add some veggies for the picky eaters in your family.  You can also make it lower in fat by using skim milk and low fat cheeses.  If you're feeling adventurous, there are many other things you could toss in here such as ham-diced and browned, left over sliced chicken, more potato nuggets or more bacon, spinach, or other veggies hanging out in the fridge that need to be used up.",

I think the problem is that there's way too much pasta. Next time I would half the amount of pasta and keep the seasonings the same; the overabundance of pasta weakens the flavor when made as directed resulting in a casserole that is surprisingly bland considering the ingredients. I couldn't taste the adobo at all and grabbed the salt shaker after my first bite which I never do. All that pasta made it the broccoli tater bacon bites hard to find too. May try this again with suggested changes but not sure. If I do I'll post again.",

It turned out really tasty! I did let the tater tots thaw a bit while i was making the pasta and bacon and still they were a bit cold after 35 minutes in the oven. I'd suggest mixing everything in a bowl before adding it to the pan and then topping with tots and cheese again. I added some fresh cut scallions to the top for a bit of texture and taste. This recipe made plenty of food for 6 people and there are still left overs!!",

As other reviews say mix everything in a bowl before you put it in the dish BUT (a big but) wait until everything has cooled to room temp. There is nothing worse than scrambled eggs and curdled milk. Forget about the butter reserve a tablespoon of the bacon grease the way nature intended. To send this recipe to the next level double the bacon and arrange a layer of fresh whole spinach leaves on top of the macaroni then add the final cheese layer.
