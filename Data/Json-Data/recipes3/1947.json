I followed Juliema's advice and added basil tarragon oregano and used half & half instead of milk. I also used 12 oz. of egg noodles because I had them on hand but they are too heavy for this recipe. It still needed a little more milk (and 1/2 the pasta) but it was absolutely delicious! I will note the additions I made and make it again for the rest of the turkey leftovers. Spray your casserole dish first; makes a lot so as one other person said put it in 2 pans and freeze one for later if there are not at least 4 of you. Great with fresh homemade bread and butter!",

After it cooks for a few minutes I added 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup white cooking wine and let simmer.  This adds so much flavor. I tend to cook a lot with the red wine vinegar.  I added the mustard and chicken broth ( I use the granular) and let simmer until tender. Then I added the flour and I used half and half.  after it was thickened, I added the turkey and cooked noodles and stirred it all together and poured it into a large glass pan. I do not put cheese in the sauce I put it all on top so it can melt. I then broil it at the end for about 3 minutes or until the cheese is crispy. My girls keep asking for this over and over. I just made it 4 days ago and now making it again by request.\n\nThank you for the recipe.",

The recipe didn't indicate whether I should grease the caserole dish so I sprayed it lightly with cooking spray and it was very easy to serve (no sticking). I baked it covered for the first 15 minutes then uncovered it for the last 10 minutes. It's a great unique way to use leftover turkey but I think it would be great with chicken as well.",
