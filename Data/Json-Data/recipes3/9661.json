                "reviewBody": "Very similar to other muffin frittata recipes; this one differing in that it calls for asparagus rather than zucchini, although a variety of vegetables would work.  Also different with this recipe is that it directs you to pre-cook the vegetables before mixing them in with the eggs and then baking.  This is an unnecessary step.   If the vegetables are chopped finely enough, which they should be anyway since these muffins are so little, you can save yourself some time and a pan to clean.  Since the asparagus (or in my case zucchini) is green,  I chose to use red rather than green bell pepper for the color contrast.  I also added fresh chopped dill because I love it. These are nutritious and wholesome but still hearty, delicious and satisfying.  I baked these in free -standing silicone cups that I sprayed with cooking spray.  They popped right out and were a cinch to clean. Good, good for you, pretty on the plate and easy clean-up.  I like that.  (Note: if you want to save a few calories I've also made these without the cheese with equally good results)",
