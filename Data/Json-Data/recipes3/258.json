I also used a large package of vanilla pudding (.5. oz) with only 2 cups of milk (as opposed to 3). This almost filled the crust. If I'd used the 3.5 oz sheesh there would not have been enough filling. Lastly I didn't use chemically altered oils to top it I used whipped cream which was actually cheaper. What I ended up with was a fast easy pie with a taste that was sweet unsophisticated and mildly compelling. After I \"made\" it I let it stiffen up in the freezer for an hour before serving. If you absolutely had to make this as a carry along you could add some gelatin to your whipped cream to prevent it from deconstrucing.",
