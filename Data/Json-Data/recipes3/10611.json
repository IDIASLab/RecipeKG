I learned how to roast cauliflower in only 20 minutes and that adding spinach to marinara sauce is a good easy way to get some greens into the diet. I found the recipe after watching Cook's Country and they recommended Barilla shelf stable 3 cheese tortellini in a taste test. I bought it and didn't really know what to do with it. I don't care for vodka sauce so I used a good brand marinara. I also used a 6oz bag of spinach and the whole head of cauliflower. Just had to chop the cauliflower smaller after it was done roasting.",
