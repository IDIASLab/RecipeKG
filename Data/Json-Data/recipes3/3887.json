I sauteed a clove of garlic with the chicken which added good flavor and threw in a good dose of black pepper. I think the proportions are a bit off. I halved the amount of chicken and pasta leaving everything else the same. Even then the sauce was a bit sparse. I imagine that would need to nearly triple the soup and milk if you were making the entire recipe. This is a huge recipe even with halving it it filled my biggest casserole dish. Anyway I thought this was quite tasty and would definitely make again.",

It wasn't dry or bland. It does make a lot so I put some in a small casserole dish to share with a friend!!!",

Also i would recommend adding some seasoning to your chicken. I added some italian seasoning the 2nd time around and it was great. We will add it to our rotation. Overall good and easy.",
