In this case I used small shell pasta (uncooked) instead of rice milk instead or mayo less cheese.

I omited the almonds simply because my husband does not like nuts! Next time I will probably decrease the mayonnaise by about a 1/4 of a cup and increase the cream of chicken soup by about a 1/4 of a cup. Other than that it is so delicious. Great comfort food. Would be great for a potluck or to take to a sick friend. Will definitely make this again and again.",

I followed the recipe but I cooked the chicken in olive oil and garlic just because garlic is so good. It is very rich and filling. Since it does have so much fat in it if I make it for myself I will use low-fat ingredients. Also you could add vegies if you'd like. Very good and easy recipe!",

I did not deviate from the recipe although I did use low-fat mayo and sour cream (not fat free) and the 98-percent fat-free soup. Also I used one of those Uncle Ben's 90-second packets of rice because it's the exact amount that the recipe calls for and it speeds things up. I used the plain white but next time I'll try a different one maybe the one with some brown rice in it because I did think the casserole could use a little color... it was just so white. I cooked it in a 9x13 casserole dish. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!",
