There is no need for the onions, just keep adding water and keep the sauce from drying out and burning.  The sauce from the pork is rich enough without onions. I cook this meal at least every few weeks, thought I would try this version....not so great compared to other czech ways (season the pork with salt/pepper/garlic POWDEr/caraway..add water and roast slowly for 300-325 for 4-6 hours until tender!  Drain sauce and thicken if desired (some don't even thicken so the dumplings soak up the juice from the sauce!)",

The technique of roasting it covered, then turning, scoring the fat and roasting UNCOVERED  (which I wish the recipe would more specifically state in step 4.  Good cooks can take a lot of knowledge for granted) works perfectly, and the crispy squares of fat were scrumptious.  You crockpot cookers will miss out on that. One thing though.  Check periodically that the bottom doesn't burn, and add some water. If you have a decent meat thermometer, I don't see how anyone can go wrong here.    ",

I would recommend cutting back on the salt, if using beef broth, because the gravy was really salty. But DELICIOUS! The pork was so juicy and tender! I halved the recipe, but used a 3 lb roast. I am so happy with the way it turned out. The rub was absolutely incredible with the pork. I made Fabulous Fried Cabbage to go with it. Simply awesome! I've had this recipe in my box for quite some time, but never got around to making it until now. Thank you so much for the recipe, Sonya! ",

I didn't think I'd care much for the carroway seeds but they blended in nicely with the mustard and spices. Thanks so much for the recipe! Practically a one pot meal!

Within an hour it was around 155. We weren't ready to eat yet so I turned the temp down to 200 and let it go for another 20 minutes. When I checked it again the temp was around 175. I then pulled the roast out an let it sit while I made the gravy according to the directions. My husband said this was the best pork roast he's ever had. I only used 2 medium sized onions",
