I replaced the onion with a very small amount of onion powder left out the salt and pepper and next time would slightly reduce the amount of butter as well. This recipe made a great side dish for Honey Grilled Fish and it would probably go well with any other flavorful fish as well. I didn't personally care for the taste of the raisins but they look beautiful and are easy enough for picky eaters to avoid:-)",
