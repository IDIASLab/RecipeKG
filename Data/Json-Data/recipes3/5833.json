I made it for lunch since it looked so simple.  It was fantastic.  Just enough spice, very flavorful, and filling.  My husband loved it,and I will definitely make it again.  I used 1/4 tsp. of both salt and pepper and about a teaspoon or so of chopped cilantro. We did add cheese, but agreed (as we ate our cheeseless second helping) that it wasn't required.  Next time I might try adding sour cream too, just for fun.  Great recipe, thanks so much!",
