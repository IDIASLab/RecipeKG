Hey I'm from Wisconsin what do ya want?? Side note: I did pierce the steaks a few times before sticking in the bags overnight. Make this recipe you won't be sorry.",

Raved about the savory garlic marinated steaks so will make that recipe instead. PS. I see I was criticized by RELISH for changing one ingredient and still rating the recipe. I agree when lots of changes are made it can be frustrating to read negative reviews. However I changed one ingredient and since many people like VODKA martinis rather than gin I thought it might be helpful to some. Also leaving reviews is helpful for me to remember what changes I made and what worked/didn't. Sorry.",
