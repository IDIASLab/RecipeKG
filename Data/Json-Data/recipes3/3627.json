We had them every year when I was growing up and when I was raising my family. We had them at Christmas and Easter time. It was a recipe only in her head so I went in search of one similar to hers and found this one. It is very similar and what is most important about them is that when she made them she made them with lots of love and family around helping. That is what the season is about spending quality time with family making memories that last a lifetime.",

I halved the recipe and the dough was too dry and crumbly to get it to come together so I added water a teaspoon at a time until it just came together. It still wasn t smooth but I didn t want to make it sticky. I rolled it as thin as I possibly could and although they were not tough they were still thicker than my expectations. Perhaps cutting it in half for a first test run was the problem and it also did not specify egg size so I just used the ones I had on hand. I ll come back with updates after my next try.",
