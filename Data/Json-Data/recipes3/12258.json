The trick here is pureeing the cauliflower in the blender. I added about 3/4 of a cup of the steaming liquid to the blender. This is where the creaminess comes from. I doubled the recipe. I had to make it taste as close to mine as possible because I was trying to fool my kids. So I added a tsp. of onion powder and a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and a Tbsp of prepared yellow mustard to the cheese/cauliflower mixture. All of the dairy elements were low fat or skim. (the cream cheese was Neufchatel.) I also added extra cauliflower. (By about 2/3 of a cup) My original uses 1/2 cup of butter and 6 cups of whole milk. What an incredibly easy way to cut fat and calories. I LOVE when that happens! This is a Dish of Delish!! Thanks so much for posting the recipe!",

I kept the cream cheese amount the same and the cheddar amount roughly the same but added an additional 1/2 cup Jarlsberg and increased the amount of cauliflower to adjust for the increase in sauce.  Very nice recipe, I would make again, and would probably garnish with Frank's red hot sauce prior to serving.",

We made it as called for but did add a more milk as we were making the cheese sauce (a 1/4 Cup) and the sauce was still very thick. Next time I may cut back a bit on the cream cheese and see if that helps create a creamier sauce. Thanks for the very good Recipe!",
