Next time I will not marinade and make the sauce just before the wings are done (slighlty melting the butter in the microwave first). Rather than simmering the sauce just use as is and it will coat the wings better. The simmering thins the sauce too much and is an unnecessary step. And if you make the sauce too early the butter will harden. However the flavor was awesome and we will definately make again and again!",

I've been making these wings for several months now and each time I make them I get tons of compliments and requests for the recipe. I never have leftovers. I don't recommend marinating them in the sauce beforehand because the butter causes the wings to flare up on the grill thus over-charring them. I found the sauce can serve at least 9 pounds of chicken wings. If you use the recommended 6 pounds you will have plenty of sauce left over.",
