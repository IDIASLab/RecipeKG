My grandmother was a good friend of Jennie Grossinger and I spent many happy weekends there in my young single days. Since I do not keep kosher I tend to substitute no trans fat margarine for the chicken fat. I also use about a dozen hard-boiled eggs to one pound of chicken livers to make it taste less like liver plus it makes a much larger quantity. For those like me who dislike liver of any kind you may find you enjoy this version.",
