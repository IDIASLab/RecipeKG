It didn't seem like it was enough beef but then the title did say \"Platano\". Next time I use more plantains. I can see why the previous poster added bell peppers and cumin. I think I will try that next time. Don't skimp on the cilantro in fact add a little more. Cilantro really brings out the flavors in this dish. I will certainly try this again maybe serve it with white rice.",
