Also I used 32 oz of chicken stock then covered the rest of the way with water and cooked the beans with a pork backbone. Then picked the meat off the bone toward the end. I I included the bacon too. I simmered the beans by much longer by accident resulting in what looked more like refried beans than soup. However my family loved it that way and the leftovers made delicious burritos! So the next 3 times I made it, I  continued with the long simmer-time.",
