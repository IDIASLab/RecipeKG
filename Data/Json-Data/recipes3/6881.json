I have to admit t hat I didnt start out telling my daughter it was ostrich--Just called it Bird and let her assume turkey the forst couple times. It makes a great juicy and super lean burger. I didn't have any fajita seasoning but my plan had been to make good ole SOS anyway. This was great. I did add a bit of garlic and extra fresh ground pepper. served on toast triangles. Will try againwith the fajita seasoning idea another time. Thanks for a new twist on ground bird.",
