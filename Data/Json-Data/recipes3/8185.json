There is No way to shake the coating on at the end of the baking time Way to fragile so I used a sieve to add the sugar mixture. It was just enough to make them more lemony. I made them in orange flavor as well. I was taking these to a birthday party at the park and was very concerned they would crumble when someone picked them up they held together and were being fought over by the 5 Yo birthday girls Mom and her sister. The party food was spicy Mexican food and the cookies were a Cool addition. Very good flavor. These would be really nice for a little girls tea party. These cookies spread like Crazy even keeping the dough/cookie sheet in the fridge and using half butter half shortening. Thank You Mariann01",

I thought these were going to be a little bland when I tasted the dough so I added a good 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. I have a lot of powdered sugar/Koolaid mix left. I got to thinking about that and figured that how do you cut in half that small of a package of Kool-Aid--and what would I do with the rest--so I will just save it for another batch. The Kool-Aid gives a sharp taste on the tongue and at first I wasn't sure if I liked that. I'll see how that holds up as the cookies set more. By the way the size of the Kool-Aid package is now.23 oz! The cooking time is right on target but I will make the cookies smaller next time (I used the smallest cookie scoop) so I'll watch the time. I got 36 cookies from this batch. I would definitely make these again.",

I had no problem whatsoever and I followed the recipe adding fresh lemon zest (about a teaspoon) to batter. I used a little more than half the lemonade mix with the powdered sugar and it was just enough tartness! I had no problem with crumbling - didn't ruin one cookie. This recipe is a keeper and will be added to my favorites. Can't wait for my family and friends to sample them for the holidays! Definitely 5 stars",

I measured my flour before I sifted which gave me balls that didn't spread or change much at all in the baking. (The reviewer who commented that they spread may have measured AFTER sifting which I USUALLY do). I needed 125 cookies for Christmas gifts and 4 recipes only gave me 100 - my cookie scoop wasn't working well because of the stiffness of the dough so mine weren't perfectly uniform. I under mixed being concerned about them turning hard. No such problem a few fell apart in my hands and had to be eaten (no hardship believe me). I also wondered if they would be lemony enough and considered adding some zest. I was glad I hadn't though - the sugar coating is very tart and needs the balance of the subtle dough. Also I made 2 recipes of the coating and had most of it left at the end. I will have enough to last me a very long time again no hardship. I did use the bag idea but one cookie at a time and VERY gently burying and unburying it. Give 'em a try if you are a lemon lover!",

Also the 3 stars was because it was very crumbly and fell apart easily but the taste was yummy. This was the first recipe I have made on this site and it was simple. The only other mistake was that we accedently put the confectioner's sugar and butter into the same bowl as the powder mix. It still turned out great but would probably make more carefully.:) Hope this helps!",
