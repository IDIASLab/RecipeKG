Vichyssoise is a French soup that is smooth and for lack of a better description--the consistency of baby food. Nowhere in this recipe does it tell you to puree it and it must be pureed in order to be a Vichyssoise. The next stumper is the pumpkin. How big is a medium pumpkin? I used 2c. of pumpkins that were already cooked and pureed. I started with cooking the dried chiles in the broth and the next step of caramelizing the onions and adding the leeks. After that I put EVERYTHING together EXCEPT the buttermilk. (That included 2 c. of pureed pumpkin.) I boiled this until the leeks were soft. Then I removed the bay leaf and in small batches pureed it in a blender until smooth. I returned the soup to the pot added the buttermilk and served. This soup has a wonderful savory cumin flavor with a bit of a spicy kick. It can be served warm but is best cold.",

The soup MUST be pureed thoroughly after cooking or the chiles will be inedible. The preparation can in other ways be simplified. I used a slow-cooker on high to soften the pumpkin in the 2c broth with the chiles. No hassle! I used a mix of New Mexico and Ancho chiles which worked well. I added a pinch of sage with the cumin. I added the buttermilk immediately prior to serving to avoid boiling it. Sour cream makes a good condiment.",

Also didn't have leeks and used spring onions instead. Caramelized 1 red and 2 spring onions for about 10-15 minutes and removed. De-glazed pan with sherry. Simmered 1.5 cups of chicken broth and added: baked squash caramelized onion 1 tsp cumin 1 bay leaf fresh ground pepper and pinches of: sage paprika and smoked paprika (or garam masala). Bring to a low boil. Remove bay leaf puree in blender. Return to pot add buttermilk and mix well. Serve with sprinkle of cinnamon.",
