I did add a few things to address the \"lack of seasoning\" that is in other review and I think it was perfect. I added one clove of garlic and two serrano peppers to the onion mixture for a little spice. I also did a dash of paprika and I salted and peppered to taste. The cuman was a little powerful when I tasted the mixture before it baked in the dough but after it was all said and done it was perfect. I used three frozen puff pastry sheets and still had scraps left over but that can be refrozen and used at a later date. \nI used my convection oven on 450 and baked for 10 min before I switched racks and then did an additional 3-5 and they came out golden and flaky. I will absolutely be making these again. THank you for the amazing recipe",

And, if you switch the position of the baking sheets betweens racks as suggested, the bottoms won't burn.   I love empanadas with raisins and we put olives (black or green) in our enchiladas too.  Hubby loves them that way.  Our Mexican family makes empanadas differently but I love a change.",
