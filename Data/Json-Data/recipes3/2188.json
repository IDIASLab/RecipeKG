I added a bit more bread crumbs...about 3/4 cup total and served it with some southwestern flavored sour cream dip but tartar would be good. I also made these on my George Foreman grill. Just spray the grill with oil spray and cook about four minutes. No need to flip or anything. Highly recommend.",

Also, use green onion and not regular. I think celery salt can be used for celery, and like other reviewers, I left out the dill all together. I added cajun seasoning, and although it was spicy, we loved it. I will definitely make these again with the above listed alterations.",
