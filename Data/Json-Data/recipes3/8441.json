                "reviewBody": "I had only russet potatoes, so that's what I used, and I had no fresh dill, so used dried.  For our taste, 2 Tbsp cider vinegar was too much because it really thinned out the dressing (it was almost like a salad dressing) and was a little too tart for us...I added a pinch of sugar.  I compensated on the dressing consistency by adding more mayo which yielded a nice smooth dressing that wasn't falling off of the potatoes. This was a nice change from the typical mayo-based potato salad, and in the future, I will reduce the vinegar to 1 Tbsp.  Thanks, bonmot, for sharing your recipe.  UPDATE 8.17.12  I had some left from dinner and was surprised this morning when I looked in the fridge that it held up great!  Wondered if the cukes would break down overnight, making it runny.  It looks exactly like it did yesterday.   Sooooo you can make it ahead of time with no concern that it'll be runny the next day.",

I love dill and decided on a whim this morning to add it to my basic recipe, but then got a little nervous about the outcome. Lo and behold, I found your recipe which confirmed my hunch that it was a good idea! I'm going to add the green onion and cucumber instead of the usual yellow onion and celery. What's funny too is that I also use apple cider vinegar in my recipe. Great minds think alike. Fantastic!! thanks. :-)",

I had to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had:  rice vinegar for the cider vinegar and bell pepper for the cucumber.  We will definitely have this again because it is super easy and we normally have some type of crunchy vegetable on hand.  It paired very well with roasted red pepper grilled chicken and grilled corn - the mild vinegar really complemented the rest of the meal.  We will definitely have again. Update: I have made this more times than I can count. Sometimes I use dill pickle juice instead of vinegar and add whatever crunchy vegetables I have. This is by far my family's favorite mayo based potato salad. You can't go wrong with it.",

After I started making it I realized I only had 1 green onion so I just used that. For the dill I subbed 2 small pinches of dry as it is more affordable and what I had on hand. I also cooled the potatoes ran them under some cold water and then refridgerated them after draining for about 1 hour. For the dressing I used white wine vinegar with lite mayo. However I think I would prefer the cider vinegar and regular mayo. My dressing got a little thin which I believe was from using lite mayo. That was my fault though. Ty",
