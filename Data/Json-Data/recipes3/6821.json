I want to try it as a wrap or as a quesadilla with the mango on top maybe. Pretty messy to eat too. I will use the marinade for chicken often. I made it a second time as a filler during a rib cookoff and this time I made it as a quesadilla. It worked great and got rave reviews. Everyone liked it better than any of the ribs. The tortillas were a lot easier to work with than the french bread. The lime-mayo helped hold it all together.",

This sandwich is delicious and COULD be really easy to make but is a bit complicated as written.

I use a food processor and one of those chopping gadgets to do most of the complicated prep work and I prep all of the veggies at the same time.  It goes quicker than you think with these tools.  I usually bake the bread the day before.  If I need to save time I buy the Dole mango strips in the jar from the produce section and buy the stores french loaves and already sliced cheese from the deli.  Red pepper and onions are cut into strips like for fajitas and grilled in a veggi grill basket.  They can also be broiled in the oven.  The key is to get that caramelizing around the edges of the vegetables.",

My approach to complicated recipes like these is to do things in stages so I marinated the chicken and made the salsa yesterday. Then I grilled the chicken and cut the mango today. I didn't grill the veggies or make the mayo. I don't like mayo and while I like grilled veggies I didn't think this sandwich needed it. After eating it I really like it although the salsa isn't the type of salsa that's my favorite. I also think it is very complicated and as SunnyB suggested it would be a good salad. I love the mango with the chicken. Thanks!",

                "reviewBody": "This was delicious. I don't think I've had a chicken sandwich this good at any restaurant I've ever been to. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because this recipe was terribly time consuming and it created a lot of dishes. I did use French bread like the recipe said but I think it would have been better with sourdough. Either way make sure you have large thick slices. I cut mine too thin and they fell apart when I was toasting the sandwiches. I also made it on a griddle instead of a grill. It didn't seem to effect the flavor at all. My husband is still praising me for making this. Finally I think I should have cut up the mango and put it in the salsa instead of slicing it. It's really difficult to get several good slices off of a mango because of the size of the seed.",
