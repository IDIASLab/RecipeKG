I took someone else's cue and added garlic prior to adding veggies and I don't think I would have liked it at all without it.  I added a little more chicken broth than called for and sauteed the pasta in the skillet with all the veggies before serving to help coat the pasta and give it a nice flavor.  A good suggestion as well is to add the red pepper flakes at the end of the cooking process instead as a topping...the pepper gave it a nice little kick that it wouldn't have had otherwise.  Overall a decent recipe that has limitless possibilities as far as toss ins go.  We'll make it again.",

This recipe hits the mark. I have made it pretty much every week since trying it several months ago. I don't add the oil I just cut up lots of mushrooms asparagus garlic red pepper flakes and throw it in the pan and cook it using as much fat free chicken broth as needed. I tried it with fat free beef broth and it's just as delicious. Once the veggies are to my liking I mix the whole pan in with the angel hair pasta. It is sooo delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe. The nice thing is that this dish goes with any type of meat you desire or no meat at all if you are looking for a meatless meal.",

I made a few revisions: used vegetable broth to make a vegetarian dish; I sauteed the asparagus with 2 cloves of garlic and added the crushed red pepper while the asparagus was sauteeing; I used baby portobellos (criminis); and added red bell pepper slices when I added the mushroom which added a nice flavor and also made for a prettier color to the dish. Using whole wheat linguini increased the health quotient of this dish. A great spring dish!",

I used spaghettini rather than angel air,  added garlic but omitted the mushrooms.  Freshly grated Parmesan cheese makes this stellar! Also, do save some of your pasta cooking water (it's GOLD!) and add it when you toss your pasta - not only will it prevent your pasta from sticking or getting gummy, but because of the starch it contains it will make almost a sauce or rich emulsion, even just with butter or olive oil.  I like to mix up my pasta right back in the pan before I transfer it to a serving dish.",
