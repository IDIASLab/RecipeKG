However, the idea of the paprika just did not appeal to me, so I left it out. I don't understand the need for it, or how it would add anything positive to an otherwise perfect dish. Using the Italian seasoning was new for me, as it's not generally something I'd add to this, but I used a good quality Tuscan blend, and used it sparingly.  No need to measure ingredients, just wing it with a little of this and a little of that to your liking--and finish with some good grated Parmesan or Romano cheese!",

Important:  add the garlic towards the end of the sataueing process -- 'browned' garlic will have a bitter taste.  First, I like to cook the onions and mushrooms together, then chop and add the more delicate tomatoe and zuchinni.  Finally add the garlic for the last 3-5 minutes.  This is a nice and easy dish to prepare, with the majority of the time waiting for water to boil, and slicing/dicing the veggies.  Also, I suggest some fresh (prefered) or dry basil.",
