I made it for my husband and it was not spicy enough for his taste so I doubled up on the sriracha. It still wasn't spicy enough for his taste (he likes it hot hot hot) but the sriracha I have must be salty. I had already added sea salt to the egg yolks and with the extra sriracha they became way too salty. I suggest that if you want to kick up the heat in this recipe that you do it with extra cayenne pepper (not extra sriracha). I also suggest caution with the salt.
