I had only added in 1/3 bunch of cilantro, and although I'm a real cilantro fan, I thought 1/3 bunch was too much.  Can't imagine what it'd have been like with a whole bunch.  I added some fresh lime juice and salt and pepper to unify the salsa.  Served with grilled chicken.  No point in frying chicken when it's just as good grilled with fewer calories.  I agree, this would be great with grilled salmon, and plan to try that next.  Thanks!",
