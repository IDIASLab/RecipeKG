I ate there many times in the 70's and this recipe seems authentic. I always omit the salt as it seems way too salty for me and everyone to whom I passed it along agrees with me, but I included it as that's the way it was given to me. Try dipping in cocktail or fry sauce.",

My Dad created them for his own restaurant in Winslow Arizona before WWII.After serving in the army in WWII he returned to Idaho. Mylo's Original Finger Steaks appeared on the front of the Menu's in \"59\" when Dad was owner of the Torch & until Torch was sold 82 then again in Yuma until 1984 at his 3rd Restaurant before his death.",

Also we never heavily salt our food or eat very many processed type foods that tend to have a lot of added salt/sodium and so the salt content here was just too much. At first I thought that was why we didn't like the recipe so after I cooked the first few fingersteaks I remade the batter using much less salt but then found the herbs to be too prominent. Just not our cup of tea. I did think the batter was a very good texture though. It clung well to the meat and crisped up nicely.",

My husband grew up in Idaho and his family has made finger steaks all growing up and he couldn't stop eating these. One trick: tenderize the steak before battering them-- it makes them soak up the seasonings a little better from the batter and it makes them well tender. Also you could probably cut back to about 1/2 of the salt or seasoning salt-- one or the other. I also followed some other's advice and made the sauce for the blooming onion... WOW! We'll definitely make these again.",
