                "reviewBody": "My healthnut son who eats no sugar requested a birthday cake. I remember attending a class about 20 years ago on how to make desserts with beans. I recall the taste tests to be favorable. So I wanted to try this recipe. I made one layer as per the recipe-subbing honey for the agave because I had none. The second layer I replaced the agave with monkfruit for the sweetener. It was a semi-dry texture and fell apart if not handled gently. I may try an extra egg next time to help it stay together and maybe some applesauce for moisture. I was nervous using the avacado frosting for a birthday. So I chickened out (is that politcally incorrect toward chickens?:P) and used buttercream instead. I will update my review when I make it again with the frosting in the recipe. I didn't tell my family what was in the cake and gave them each a small slice. 9 out of ten liked the cake. My son LOVED it! He took the other half of the cake home to have a sweet treat the rest of the week.",
