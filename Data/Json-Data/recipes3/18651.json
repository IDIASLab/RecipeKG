I don't typically have green onions on hand so I substitute yellow or white onions (whatever I have)and it tastes yummy anyway. I always leave out the sage because we don't care for the flavor. You could use regular hotdogs as they are less expensive but the veggie dogs are healthier. I suggest skipping the step where you reserve part of the hotdog mixture for topping.The topping ends up sinking into the cornbread mix anyway so it really isn't necessary.",

                "reviewBody": "Good recipe. I left out the celery and onion to make mine REALLY kid friendly (if making for grown-ups I'd definitely leave it in) and instead I added celery salt and onion powder. Used a box of Jiffy corn bread mix and turkey hot dogs (watch the celery salt if you use regular hot dogs - might make it too salty) I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan for 20 mins - any longer would've been too much (next time I'll bake for 18mins). Be careful of the timing especially if you omit the onion and celery as they add moisture. I DID use the sage in this. I think that if you use light or vegetarian franks in this it is a good idea to kick up the cornbread. If you use regular hot dogs you may not need the sage...it's a matter of personal cornbread preference I guess (I'm from the south and I like seasoned cornbread) Thanks for the recipe.",
