I instead used 2 tsp of olive oil for the butter.  Instead of using flour, I used 1 cup of potatoes, diced fine (in place of rice), since it will thicken up a stew anyway.  I added 1% fat milk instead of cream, and passed around light sour cream for everyone to dollop on top (which totally was delicious, don't leave it out!)  I used a total of 200g of raw chicken as well.  The calories for me turned out to be 58 per 100g (I weighed the whole thing after cooking and then calculated a 100g serving.) fat 1.2g, carbs 6g, and protein 5.8g.  (These calcs do not include the sour cream on top.)  I'll definitely make it again, husband gave it a 10/10!  And I grated the carrots, since I'm not a fan of them in dice form.",

In my opinion, the cream is completely unnecessay...sooo good w/o it.(and less fattening too) Even my 8 year old and 18month old gobbled it up asking for more...definately double the recipe, or triple and freeze. Thank you so much!UPDATE: I have made this soup about 10 times now....I always double the recipe, add 3 tablespoons of yellow curry (so much more flavor) and I cut the apples in larger cubes cuz you can taste them so much more like that, and I use brown rice instead of white and just let it simmer longer.

I LOVE this! - adding to original review - I used a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of red and yellow curries, and also added the same amount of Garam Masala as I did the curry.  I have also stopped using butter, and switched to coconut oil and all coconut milk instead of cream. Pinot Nior was a perfect wine to have with this!",
