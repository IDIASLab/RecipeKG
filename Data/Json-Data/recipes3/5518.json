I subbed a pound can of diced tomatoes (undrained) for the fresh tomatoes.  I didn't blend it either.  It was fine.  This is a soup you have to finish the day it's made or the shrimp will become tough with reheating - no matter how gently you do it.  I used reduced fat feta & added it to individual bowls instead of the pot.  It sank right away.  Some garlic croutons, or even toasted garlic bread would be a good suggestion for each bowl.  Then, when you add the feta it has a \"raft\" & can be better distributed with each spoonful instead of the last one. Note4Me:  After making. Try with asiago topped garlic bread in each bowl.  Sub Chicken for clam broth.",

It put it over the top for us! It was like something you'd taste in a 5 star restaurant! LOVE THIS! NOTE - I am going to try making the soup the night before I need it BUT will NOT ADD the shrimp until I serve the soup the next day. I'll simmer it 3 min to reheat/and cook the shrimp. I think this will work. NEW NOTE I have since made this using chicken broth as a substitute for the clam juice and I could not tell any difference in the delicious flavor. Chicken broth is much more economical then using the clam juice.",
