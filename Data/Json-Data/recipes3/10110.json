I made these alterations to make them vegan: (1) I used a homemade vegan parmesan cheese substitute (consisting of crushed sesame, garlic powder, onion powder and vegan boullion)(2) 1T Flax seed + 3T water to substitute the egg.\n\nMy husband complained a little that they were slightly dry and had a little too much tempeh aftertaste.\n\nNext time I would make these slight alterations:\n(1) Add some fennel seed (maybe 1 tsp)for added flavor\n(2) Might add a little chopped spinach leaves for color and a little added moisture.\n(3) Double the boiling time on the tempeh from 5 minutes to 10 to hopefully cut down on any aftertaste... in any event, I'm sure once they're served with tomatoe sauce, any after-taste wouldn't be noticeable.  Added to my recipe box!",
