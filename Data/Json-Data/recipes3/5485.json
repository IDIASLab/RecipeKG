I used fresh mushrooms, red pepper and I added some fresh minced garlic and sauteed it with a little butter. I used Johnny's Seasoning Salt (Seattle, reppin' here!). For the rolls, I did spread them with garlic butter before toasting  I did not eat this but my boys did and they really liked it. It was very simple, used on hand ingredients AND I was able to make dinner in no time. I'll use this recipe again. NOTE: It's really sad when people downrate a recipe due to them not being \"authentic\" or not what they expect a \"real\" version of the recipe to be. Everyone has their own take on what they think is good food. For us, we liked this (with a few small changes to suit what worked for us) and we'll make it again.",

I don't usually care for roast beef, but when it was cooked up for these sandwiches---Delicious!  I bought shaved roast beef from the deli and cooked it on the griddle with only Seasoned Salt and pulled it apart with two forks as it cooked.  I sauteed the onions and peppers in a pan with some olive oil and toasted the hoagie rolls under the broiler.  Set the sandwiches out on the table with some mayo and they were gone in no time flat!  My husband even said they were better than the ones he had in Philly on his last trip! We'll be making these again!",
