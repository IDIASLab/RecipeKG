If you do shake it keep in mind that the whole point of shaking is to aerate the liquor which changes the taste - so shake it well not gently. If you want you can add baby pickled onions on a pick instead of an olive in which case it is called a Gibson martini.",

Start with your glass filled with crushed ice and water to chill glass.

Winston Churchill: \"The way to make the perfect Martini is to pour an ice cold gin drop an olive in it and bow in the direction of France\". This is almost definitely a misquote. Winston is correct about the vermouth though if he may be exaggerating slightly. The way I make one is to fill a shaker with ice pour in about the same measure or vermouth as you have there but shake with just the vermouth so that the ice gets a covering then pour the liquid away. I then pour in the gin gin gently as to not bruise it and stir it rather than shake it to retain the flavour. Always Noilly Prat dry vermouth and always a top shelf gin. Stuffed olive or flamed lemon rind is fine dirtyness is to your own discretion",
