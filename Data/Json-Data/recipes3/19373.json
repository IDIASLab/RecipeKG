I think it would be better to bake these in a Pyrex dish instead of a cookie sheet - they produce a lot of grease when they bake and I ended up with a very smoky oven when the grease overflowed my flat cookie sheets. The balls were very hard to remove with a spatula and I had to throw away the cookie sheets afterwards - too hard to clean too much baked-on residue. As for the finished balls I thought they tasted OK a little tough/chewy not crisy as I had imagined. My guests at them all up so I guess it wasn't a total loss!",
