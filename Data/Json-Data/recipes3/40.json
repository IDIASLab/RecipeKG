I put the beef mixture in the bottom of the dish, then layered canned French cut green beans and canned corn (both drained thoroughly).  I can't stand cream of chicken soup, so I mixed a can of cream of mushroom with a can of cheddar cheese soup and poured half the mixture over the meat and veggies. Then I added the tater tots on top and spread the remaining soup mixture over that and baked.  Husband loved it!",

There was no way you could convince to to layer the uncooked beef in my casserole dish so I browned it first with onions and minced garlic. I used a pkg of mixed veggies that included carrots, corn and grn bean, followed by a layer of sharp cheddar cheese.  I needed a little milk to make the cream of chix soup to work a little better but I poured about 1/3 of my \"soup mix\" over the hamburger, then layered the tater tots, and then the remaining soup mix over all.  I baked 1/2 time covered and then another 35-40 minuted uncovered and it turned out really well. When your tired of your tater tot recipe - try this one. Its not drastically different but its still a filling and tasty homecooked meal! Thanks!",

There was no danger in the beef not being cooked through however you must be ready for the \"slab\" effect and be ready to cut through it. I also agree that you might want to season the dish with some of your favorite spices prior to cooking. other than that I was very happy with the dish. I will definitely make it again and probably add some seasoning and shredded cheddar to the cream of chicken soup.",
