You can substitute 6 tablespoons of whole ground flaxmeal for the butter.If you have time hold the raisins and cinnamon until after the first rise. Toss the raisins and cinnamon together in a bowl. Roll the dough out to 10x15 sprinkle the raisin mixture evenly and roll the dough up from the long edge. Using dental floss or thread slice the rolled dough into 1\"slices. Place them cut side down into a pan sprayed with PAM. Cover and let rise for 20' and bake for 20-25'at 375'. Lovely sweet rolls!",

The only bad thing about it is the crust even on the light setting it tends to taste burnt but that certainly doesn't put me off making it. For an interesting variation try replacing the soy milk with Earl Grey tea and soaking the raisins in it for an hour beforehand. Yummy.",

I did cut it down to 11 servings as I only have a 1 and 1/2 pound bread maker. I doubled the amount of cinnamon and I used sugar instead of honey. I also used olive oil instead of butter because I don't like using butter for anything if I don't have to. My bread did not rise but it did not effect the taste. That was my fault though. I used cold soy milk instead of at room temperature or warm. I don't know what I was thinking. I am going to make it again this weekend I think because my sister was on vacation when I made it and she just has to try it. My family also raved about it. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I have used regular milk when I don't have soy on hand. The only thing is I put about 1/2 tsp more yeast so that the top doesn't sink in my machine. Update-I've been making this bread for years now. DS still loves it; however he doesn't like raisins anymore. I make the dough in my machine and then bake in the oven.",
