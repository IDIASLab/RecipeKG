I order poutine when I go to diners, but I also buy fresh cheese curd to make my own at home. Homemade gravy is really easy and quick to make. The only rule I don't follow for authentic poutine is that I don't fry my French fries; I bake them in the oven. Be careful. This is very addictive!",

I've tried it with baked fries and it works well with you spray them with a bit of olive or coconut oil to get that tender crisp texture needed to make the poutine authentic. The gravy is excellent. I am from Eastern Ontario but live in Missouri now and I agree that fresh curd is near impossible to find. If you splurge on some fresh mozzarella in a package with the liquid it is pretty good but try asking your grocer if he's willing to order some curd it's so worth it!",
