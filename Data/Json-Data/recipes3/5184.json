I only added one jalapeno pepper (with seeds) so I didn't think it would be that hot. I don't think this recipe needs the extra hot sauce! I also agree with some of the other reviews that it was salty and had too much cilantro. I love cilantro but it made the salsa really green so it was a bit overpowering. I don't think it needs any salt or garlic powder especially if you are using chips with salt already on them. I will give it 3 stars because I was able to tone down the heat with more tomato and lime juice and was good because it was fresh. But I will have to change up the recipe if I was to make it again.",

Also let the tomatoes sit in fridge for an hour before adding other ingredients and then drain the water off of the top (they're tomatoes...they will get watery) then add remaining ingredients. If your concerned about heat (the hotter the better for me) add jalapenos and hot sauce until desired spiciness. I love this recipe as is. Thanks J-Shep!",
