For those of you who do not know Goat Cheese is very tangy (not sour) with a almost feta cheese quality/flavor/texture minus the \"parmigiano reggiano\" notes and nuances. I sauteed the asparagus as stated the first time but the second time I sauteed it under very high heat with crushed garlic that was browned to a sweet crisp. It brought out the depth of the cheese and allowed a full flavor combination to be experienced as an explosion of varying yet satisfying flavors.",
