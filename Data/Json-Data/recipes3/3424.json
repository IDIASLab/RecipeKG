I decided to jazz it up a little. First of all, I used a chicken cut into pieces (which saved me the trouble of basting since they were mostly covered in liquid). Also, I cut down on the butter by about half (I actually used margarine). I didn't have pineapple juice, so I used a can of pineapple chunks (liquid included). I also spiced it up with some hot paprika & an Italian chilli & garlic spice mix I had on hand (oregano,chilli, garlic, etc.) & stuck some fresh crushed garlic under the skin. I may have also stuck in a quartered onion, though I can't remember! What I do remember is that it was a big hit with my guests. So tender & such a lovely color! Thank you!",

I didn't really measure anything, but I added pineapple chunks with the juice, plenty of soy sauce, minced onion, salt & pepper, garlic (2 cloves), & lots of ground ginger.  I made a thick sauce, using corn starch, with the resulting juice/broth after the chicken was cooked. I liked that, but my husband doesn't like sweet sauces with his meat.  He thought the chicken was good, though.  My 2 toddlers ate this pretty well, too.  I agree that you can't taste the orange juice too much.  Don't be afraid to add ginger; it's the perfect seasoning for this!  And I think the pineapple chunks (or slices) are a MUST to make it tastier & more appealing.",
