If I did anything differently I would mash fewer potatoes leaving more cubes in the soup (personal preference) and thicken with a little cornstarch slurry if necessary. Muenster cheese is not bold (very mild) and the chicken broth adds needed flavor so I'd recommend making this soup only with broth not water. Didn't have an avocado for a garnish but will try that next time.",

For all my cooking experience, I\u2019m still not that great at calculating veggies by weight so after peeling and chopping potatoes; I ended up using just shy of 5 c. I also used a whole onion and extra garlic. When it came time to \u201cmash\u201d - I used my immersion blender and practiced great restraint to get a smooth yet chunky soup. Soup was thick but looked good. Once I added Munster cheese (8oz sliced, not shredded) got even thicker. For us! This is not a complaint! My husband laughed; are we eating potato soup or mashed potatoes? It\u2019s not quite either? Whatever it is, we enjoyed! A lot!! Could see adding crumbled bacon or green onions? Overall, very good!! No idea if my result is close to authentic but dang! Still delicious!",
