I substituted things for what I had on hand (ground ginger instead of fresh crimini mushrooms and 1/2 tsp. of fresh chili paste instead of the diced red chili). I also used more like 2Tbs of soy sauce istead of 1 and threw in juice of 1/2 lime. Huge hit! I chopped mushrooms and spread them out in a 9x13 pan with cauliflower florets (just to add more veggies) and lay the snapper over the top of them. Topped seasoned fish with diced tomato and poured soy/sesame oil/lime juice/chili paste mixture over the top. 400 for 15 minutes. Sprinkled with the cilantro after. Delicious! Best white fish recipe!",
