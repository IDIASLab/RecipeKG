I made a few alterations -- used 1.5 cans dried green chiles instead of 2 and 1 tsp chili powder. And instead of fresh cilantro I used Knorr's dried cube cilantro which worked great for flavoring and didn't leave little green leafy things in the casserole. The only drawback was the preparation time -- it took a lot of time and I sure hoped the recipe would be worth it. Surprise! It was totally worth it! It set up perfectly w/in the cooking time (and for high altitude that's awesome). The teenagers LOVED it. Thanks Johnsonville once again a new family favorite.",

I used the original breakfast sausage from Johnsonville, and even though it does contain MSG, I did not get a headache or retain water from it---a very happy result!

Like other cooks I halved the recipe as it's just the two of us however unlike others that found it too loose we found that my casserole was a bit dry. A dollop of sour cream worked for the first meal. On a reheat it just became drier. Would I make this again? Yes I will with some small changes. Nobody beats the quality of Johnsonville sausage. P.S. Sorry no picture. My dear husband accidently deleted it from the camera.",
