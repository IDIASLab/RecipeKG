I don't think you get 16 servings out of it but it is a very quick and easy meal. I would have given five stars for flavor but when you add everything up it was still a little expensive.",

I also tossed in a whole cut up zucchini to add veggies to this. I cooked th zucchini with olive oil and garlic then added in the salami to get out some of the grease then went from there.
