When I was compiling the layers I realized I did not have enough eggplant and popped some more cut up slices in the microwave for 5 minutes--it was just as yummy as the ones done in the oven. BTW the salting does not need to be done on eggplant prepared like this.  You are not drawing out the moisture--salting is to take out the bitterness.  A step that I no longer bother with anymore anytime I prepare eggplant.  But then, I love it! Thanks for sharing!",

First, don't try this recipe with only one eggplant, you really do need two. Second, I had more luck leaving the peel on...it meant less burnt slices from the oven and a meatier texture of the final product. The slices do easily burn, you have to start keeping a close watch after 15 minutes. I used pasta sauce instead of the tomato sauce/spices, but did add a little extra basil and oregano to taste. I LOVE that this recipe doesn't require \"sweating\" the eggplant slices or breading/frying the slices...SO much work, not to mention we're trying to do low-carb right now, and this recipe fit the bill. I've made it twice now and it's earned a place in the menu rotation...no small feat!",
