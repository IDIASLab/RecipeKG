Perhaps I would add a touch of garlic salt or garlic powder the next time.  Salt & pepper are definitely in order for this recipe.  Remember that anytime you are incorporating egg into a hot liquid, you need to take care that it doesn't immediately cook the egg so that you end up with tiny egg bits.  Take a small amount of the hot cheese/cream sauce (1/4 cup or so) and put it in a bowl.  Slowly add the egg yolk, stirring constantly.  Once you've mixed the egg with that small bit of hot cream sauce, you can add it all back into the pan.\n\n*** Update.  Recently, I made this recipe and I used all parmesan cheese because that's what I had in the house.  What I used was shredded parmesan, rather than the container of grated parmesan (you know it, we all have it in the house).  What an amazing difference this made, the sauce was thick, rich, and amazing.  I went right out and bought the ingredients to make it a few more times!",

                "reviewBody": "People need to remember that restaurant style Alfredo Sauce is NOT LIKE the bottled stuff!  I had tried some homemade Alfredo Sauce recipes before this one, but none turned out as close to what I expected as this recipe did.  First, the taste was absolutely scrumptious!  I only used fresh grated parmesan cheese with no romano, as I did not have that on hand.  I also grated about 2 cloves of garlic in, which made the sauce, in addition to a little dried parsley flakes for color and texture.  I used half and half instead of cream, so I'm not sure how thick this would have turned out if I had used heavy cream.  Because I like my Alfredo Sauce just a little thicker than standard restaurant style sauce, I don't know if this sauce was just a bit thinner than I'd like because I used half-n-half or if maybe I could do something else besides adding more parmesan, which is what I did this time to thicken it up a bit.  Next time I'll use the parmesan and romano, real cream and I think I'll follow the advice given by several other reviewers by adding a tablespoon or two of whipped cream cheese - just to get the texture and thickness closer to what I want.  Hands down, this is the best homemade Alfredo Sauce recipe I found.",

In short, it is the 'EGG YOLK' that gives that 'restaurant' taste one is always looking for.  I cook my Sauce a little differently, but in method only. I whip my egg yolks for a minute first, ('plural' becasue I always make a double or triple Alfredo recipe), then, once the cream and butter are hot enough, I pour that mixture into the egg yolks to temper them. Back onto the stove at the lowest heat possible, I immediately add the cheeses just to melt, and then pour the Sauce right over whatever noodles I'm using.  Every single 'Alfredo Sacue' online that doesn't incorporate 'EGG YOLKS' cannot call itself a 'true' Alfredo and should, in my opinion, be thrown off the web! *lol*  Because 'Alfredo' is such a basic egg/cream sauce, you can tweek it to your heart's content... a little garlic, a little tarragon, a little basil, rosemary, or thyme... whatever is floating your boat at the moment.",

I added some cracked pepper, minced garlic and chopped Italian parsley and I was completely impressed with the flavor!  My second time around, I added steamed broccoli and carrots - YUM.  Thanks for sharing this one!!",
