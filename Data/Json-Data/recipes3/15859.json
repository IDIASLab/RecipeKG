I really liked it and more would have been nice.\n\nThe sauce is very light and thin, but oh-so flavorful and we liked it that way, especially with the warmer summer weather.

For me, I would have liked this much better leaving out the Cajun seasoning altogether!  I did prepare this a little differently - I coated the shrimp in olive oil and rubbed them with Cajun seasoning (just to my liking, didn't measure).  I had them set awhile until I was ready to have Hubs throw them on the charcoal grill.  Meantime, I prepared the pasta and sauce, of course without the shrimp and Cajun seasoning.   Hubs and I are not big eaters, but I found scaling this recipe to three servings was barely enough pasta for the two of us, so please keep that in mind!  I found I had to add more of the spinach as well - except I used baby arugula, since that's what I had in the fridge.   I piled the pasta (again, wonderful as is, without the seasoning!) into big, individual pasta bowls,  then topped it with the grilled shrimp.  For those having trouble locating the orecchiette (they're so darned cute!), you'll find it wherever the DeCecco brand of pasta is sold.",

I used Emeril's BAM seasoning instead of cajun. Not too spicy that way. My 2 year old ate it! Use the right pasta it calls for too. They really soak up the sauce and have a great texture. This is in my top 10! I also doubled the spinach and garlic and green onion.",

I modified it just a bit by doing what the last reviewer mentioned: I cooked the pasta (used a different pasta as I couldn't find Orecchiette in the store) then set aside. Then I used a lot less butter (probably 1 1/2 TB) and 1 TB olive oil in the pan. I added the shrimp and cajun (used a full 1 1/2 teaspoons)and sauted for 1 minute. Then i added the onions and garlic and sauted for a few more minutes. Finally i added the canned tomatoes (drained first) then white wine and spinach (increased to 2 - 3 cups of spinach) and pasta. COoked covered for 6 minutes or so and then i was done. I actually forgot the black pepper but there was plenty of spiciness and it wasn't missed. served it to my fiance and mom with crusty garlic bread and salad and it was a winner! Very spicy but not insanely so. For people who love spicy food this is perfect! For people who are more sensitive to spice just reduce cajun seasoning to 1/2 teaspoon. Yum!!!",
