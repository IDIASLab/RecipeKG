I used diced tomatoes w/chiles added 2c of vegetable broth and 1/2c of chardonnay with the tomatoes. I let it simmer for an hour pureed the whole thing for a smooth texture and then stirred in 1/2 c of heavy cream. For anyone wondering it made me about 7 cups and each cup was roughly 215 calories. I may try fresh tomatoes next time to try and lower the sodium a bit. Also with the addition of the chiles I left out the cayenne pepper and it still had a nice kick.",
