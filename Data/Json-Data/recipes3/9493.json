I had the meat and was just looking for a quick recipe for dinner so I didn't marinate my meat but I bet that is a nice addition. I got my mayo/garlic-basil mixed together; I put the meat on the grill and watched it closely (it's very thin and cooks fast) then I just put together my sandwiches just like the recipe and dinner was done in a flash!! The flavors were so good together!!",
