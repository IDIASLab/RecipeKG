The chicken was very well seasoned and the rice was perfect. It's hard to make a Spanish chicken and rice dish well and I think this more than hit the mark. Loved the use of the frozen sofrito...it was made w/fresh ingredients and I usually by the canned stuff. This was SO MUCH BETTER. Great job Birds Eye and thank you!!!",
