I added sauteed onions and garlic with bacon to the Brussels sprouts added some red pepper flakes and dijon mustard to the bechemel sauce and even sprinkled a tiny bit of lemon juice over the Brussels sprouts mixture. I used an asiago/parmesan mixture in place of the Velveeta (I don't use processed cheese). Maybe an extra sharp cheddar instead would help. I ate this with oven roasted cherry tomatoes which helped. I definitely will not make this again.",
