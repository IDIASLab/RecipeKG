As always, I added some stuff, but not because it needed it, because I love the stuff I added, celery and celery salt (instead of the regular stuff)  And I added some cooked shrimp too.  When I was ready to add the seafood, mushrooms, onions, and celery, I transferred it to the crock pot, and set it to warm.  That's just hot enough to make it hot, without bringing it to a boil.  Delicious Pam Rosterman.  Thank you!",

With that said I think if I were to try this again it would be with those changes. It was otherwise easy to prepare and the base was delicious.",

I followed the recipe as written except that I swapped out one of the cans of clams for a can of lump crab meat. My guests thought this was tasty and my sister even asked for seconds (she's a pretty picky eater). I think I would definitely like to try duplicating this recipe with fresh seafood because I think it will help the overall flavor and body of the soup. This was my first time using canned seafood for anything and I was super impressed with the seafood itself. Overall a very good soup.",
