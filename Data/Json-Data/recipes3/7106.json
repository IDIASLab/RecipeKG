Even bigger, they can be split and filled with ham, chicken, tuna salad, or even more cheese!  These are easier to make than the recipe sounds, yet the result looks impressive enough that you can tell your friends you slaved over them.",

The only thing that was confusing was the matter of the eggs. You're going to separate and reserve 1 egg. The egg yolk you will mix with 2 Tablespoons of milk to make the glaze and the white you're going to beat into the mix. When you incorporate the eggs do so one at a time. Ensure that you mix them all very well after each addition. When I piped them out I just used a Ziploc bag that I cut a 1/2 inch tip off one corner then piped them out. Don't flatten them make nice little mounds. I also added a pinch of baking powder just to ensure they puffed up. It works everytime. I'm too much of a puss not to do that! Happy Baking!",
