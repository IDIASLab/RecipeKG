To get the brown you'd expect, it totally dried out the juice in the pickle sliced. Using pickle spears is genius! I made these exactly as written and they turned out perfect. They had just the right amount of crunch and juice you expect from a fried pickle but without the \"fry\". I had a jar of regular spears opened in the fridge with only two spears left and decided to throw them in the mix. For all of you non spicy fans, they turned out great too and had plenty of flavor. This is 5 stars all the way. Thanks for sharing bd.weld!",
