Once a poor-man's GOP's, it's now considered a cultural delicacy from Jamaica through the Lesser Antilles and onto Guyana. Tomato sauces work but tamarind or fig sauces or - for an awesome American twist try a natural, red jam or preserve mixed with some sriracha to to give it that extra something that this simple food feels like it needs. Also no deep fryer necessary just use a pot with hot oil and a metal sifter/ screen. This dish tastes fantastic with fish entrees that need to be made more substantial. Don't eat too many though, they stick to you!",

I used yellow split peas, which yielded a much more typical looking batter.  I used cumin instead of curry powder, and jalapeno instead of serrano, coconut flour instead of flour (and less than half as much, since coconut flour is very absorbent), and baking soda instead of baking powder.  I also added a coupled tablespoons of olive oil to help the blender blend up the peas a bit better.  I also made mine bigger - dropping the batter in rounded tablespoons instead of teaspoons.  These were fabulous, and everyone loved them, from my husband on down to the 17mo twins.  We dipped them in salsa.",
