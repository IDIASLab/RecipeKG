They are a little tedious for the amount you get, so I highly suggest you double or triple the recipe.

I'll be doubling or tripling when I make in future. tastes a lot like cheese bits crackers. I overcooked some that I made as thin as possible as u can see in pic. anyone know if these can be kept in airtight container in cabinet or do they need to be refrigerated?",
