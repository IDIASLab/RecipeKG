I've modified several times and I'm getting close to what I consider real Italian hot sausage from the neighborhood. Good spices, just needs a little help. Try this: \n * cut back to 3-4 lbs of pork (grind your own) \n * 1/2 tsp salt, \n * 1 tbs garlic salt, \n * 1/2 tsp pepper, \n * 1 tbs paprika, \n * 1/4 C olive oil, \n * 1/2 tbs anise , \n * 2 tbs fennel seed, (fennel is porks best friend)\n * 1 tbs red pepper\n\nTrick: after is sets overnight, fry up a meatball of it and check its flavor. Add what you think it needs and set it overnight again. If it's fresh you should be able to do this several times before you have to freeze it or cook it. \n\nVinnie",

I worked in Italian restaurants for 7-8 years and ours was never this tasty (although we would buy it in from local Italian butchers/deli's. I scaled down this recipe to 4 servings (1lb pork) just to see, I will buy 2-3 pounds next time and freeze in individual portions. I could not find the anise seed so simply left it out and was fine without. I compared this recipe to a few others I saw and could not believe the amount of peppers fennels used in theirs, way too hot, you want a nice hot taste you can enjoy while still tasting the pork like this recipe gives, perfect! you don't want to blow your head off, what for? might as well just cover a plain burger/sausage in tobasco!! I also just had this plain on a portuguese roll(can't find good Italian bread here apart from ciabatta) no butter no onions or peppers, with sausage this tasty you don't need anything else really. Thanks (UPDATE) I just scaled this recipe to 12 portions(3lb pork) don't do it, the ingredients are all wrong! the pork says 3 pounds which is 3 times the original recipe I made(1lb porkbut all the salt and rest of ngredients has been multiplied by 4!! way too salty, couldn't believe it. So, scale down the recipe to 4 or 8 servings but not 12 as it is all wrong.",

I did scale this down to 8 because I only had about 2 lbs of pork and I didn't have the anise so I left it out. I added some onion flakes but made no other changes. I tried this with spaghetti and the sausage was very much over powered by the tomato sauce. Probably won't try again but glad I gave it a shot.",
