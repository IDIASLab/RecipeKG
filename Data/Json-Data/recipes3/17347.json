                "reviewBody": "Okay a few things: Food processor-- Put the nuts in first grind to a coarse grain then add the flour and seasonings. Nuts just kind of floated around in the cup of flour and I had to put it through a sieve to get the nuts. Baking-- These spread about a centimeter in all directions as they bake. Complex or subtly curved shapes (snails hearts multi-stroke kanji) do not survive. Shapes with sharp corners like stars turned out surprisingly well. Either stick to circles stars and certain flower shapes or do your cutting post-baking (I really wanted those snails). The dough was tasty though I'd probably add more lemon zest and maybe some extract or liquer next time. I substituted a tin of peanut with coconut from the oriental grocery for the hazelnuts and they were nice. Any distintively flavorful nut would do well. I misread the recipe as advising \"lemon molasses\" which confused me so I ended up with bootstrap molasses in my cookie sandwiches. It um seems alright. They're not seeping too badly and after they've chillded I think they'll be fine. The holes I made having shrunk in baking actually looked pretty classy with the molasses showing through. Again a star shape worked well although it did not really resemble a star. The cookies were pretty crumbly though again I think that would be improved by more solid shapes. I've yet to try a sandwich but the scraps from my pan were quite nice.",

                "reviewBody": "This cookie is a very delicious cookie and I find myself wanting to lick out the filling and just eat the cookie by itself. The lemon marmalade I had was kind of bitter so I made some using that orange marmalade (better) and Trader Joe's Salted Caramel Sauce. I think that something with dark chocolate or semisweet would even be better! When I put the two cookies together I thought they were a little thick so next time I'd make them a little thinner than 1/4\". I used my linzer cookie cutter so rather than 6 cookies I ended up with 13 cookies because they are smaller (I would have had 14 except I did a little taste testing in there). I also cooked them about 15 minutes at 325. I did as the first reviewer suggested to grind the nuts first using my Cuisinart Smartstick. I forgot to sprinkle them with powdered sugar so next time I'll do that. And there will be a next time! Thank you for a wonderful little cookie Laria Tabul.",
