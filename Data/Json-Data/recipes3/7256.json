Whole wheat noodles hold up well in this recipe.",

First we use ground chorizo in our house so I browned that up instead of using the slices so the outcome was textured like a meatsauce and spicy throughout. The tomatoes I used were fire roasted which added a great flavor to the sauce. I only used about half the milk because the sauce would've been too thin for my liking with more. For the cheese used taco blend not Parmesan. Hubby thought the final outcome was 5 delish but since I fixed it up a bit and didn't like it THAT much I'll rate it 4 overall.",
