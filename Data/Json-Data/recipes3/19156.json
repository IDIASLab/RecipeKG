Then I take the icecream cone and place the open end on the batter. As the cupcake cooks it bakes up into the cone.  I've never had a problem with soggy cones. Then I take the cone out of the tin, peel off the liner, and then frost after they cool.  This leaves a nice round mound on the top of your cone perfect for icing! ",

It only happens when they are overfilled with batter and the batter leaks over the sides during baking.

I must say though that I have never had leftovers so cannot comment on whether or not they are soggy the next day. These are a great crowd pleaser!!",

By far the best way is to bake the cupcake in a regular baking cup/paper after the cupcake is cooled cut the top off the cupcake but leave a small ridge of where the paper was(so you can tuck that part inside the cone). Now cut the bottom of the cupcake in half and put both halves inside the cone - it should fit nicely. Tuck the top of the cupcake into the top rim of the cone don't just set it on the cone or it will fall off too easily plus tucking it in will make a nice rounded cupcake so your frosting will be higher and look like an actual ice cream cone. I used a buttercream frosting with a piping bag and a #2D tip on it to swirl the frosting around the cupcake making it look like icecream. Had I had more time I would have painted some stripes of coloring in the bag and made a strawberry swirl affect with the icing but it was after midnight....things you will do for your kids!",

Most of the cupcakes ran over and were a mess. After cooling I trimmed them and was able to even them out with frosting. The second batch followed the review that said to use a cupcake liner and place the cone on top of the batter. This was more successful but some of the cupcakes turned out lopsided. The final batch was made in a regular muffin pan without liners. I pierced a small hole in the bottom of each cone with a chopstick so that steam could escape during baking then I placed the cone upside down on the batter. Halfway through baking I straightened the cones. This batch came out the best of the three!",
