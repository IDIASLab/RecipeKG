It's one of those things that make me ask \"what made this person come up with this recipe?\"  Anyway, the steak is very tasty and very juicy.  However, the meat was not tender. We bought two steaks so the next one I'll tenderize with a mashed kiwi fruit for 20 minutes, followed by the mustard/tea coating.  As per the recipe, which I followed to a \"tea\", I lightly oiled the grill but the coating still stuck to the grill.  If I can get this work, I'll buy a bunch more of these steaks and stock them in the freezer for the summer.  Apparently, this cut is to become the next IN meat cut, which means the price will rise. I served the steak with fresh green beans and Greek Oven Baked Fries both of which I also cooked on the grill.  Regardless, thanks to Donna, the poster, for the recipe. Update: tenderizing with kiwi, which works for other cuts, didn't work enough with this.  It was still very chewy.",

I was intrigued by the idea of using tea leaves on the steak and although I think I would try it again - I wouldn't use mustard as the 'glue'. We like the flavor of steak but with this method all we could taste was mustard I'm afraid.",
