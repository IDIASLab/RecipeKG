I use checken tenderloins. To save time I put seasoned flour in a plastic baggie and shake to coat. I saut\u00e9 the chicken in a mixture of 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter. When chicken is lightly browned on both sides remove the chicken to a plate. I add one head of garlic (chopped) to the pan. When golden pour in Marsala scrape the sides and bottom of pan to incorporate the flavors and cook down a bit. Add 1 cup chicken broth stir and return chicken to the pan. Add the mushrooms and cover the pan. Cook for a few minutes until chicken is cooked through. Sprinkle with a tablespoon of chopped pasely and serve immediately.",

For my family, I have learned to double the whole recipe, only with more mushrooms!! If you think the tomatoes and the rosemary seem out of place, please, please, please use them and you will see how the flavors simply meld when all is done!! I am celiac and simply use gluten-free flour, wiping the over-browned flour from the pan before adding more butter and saut\u00e9ing the rest of the chicken. Carrabbas is one of my faves, but this recipe out-shines their marsala!! Thanks for a true winner.",

My husband is a mushroom lover so I used about 2 cups. I did double the liquid amounts as someone else had reported trying but with a sprinkle of flour before the addition of liquid to butter I thought it thickened up very well. I served it with garlic /Parmesan mashed potatoes. Family says its s keeper! One change I think I will try next time is that I will grill my chicken before adding it to the sauce. I just love the flavor that grilling adds!",
