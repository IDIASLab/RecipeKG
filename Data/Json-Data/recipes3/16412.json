I tasted it before putting it into the oven, and felt like it needed a bit of something. So I added in mushrooms and peas, and I feel that's what this dish was missing--a few veggies. I could see also adding in carrots, celery, garlic, or bell peppers too. I also used shell pasta in place of penne. Overall, it's a great, simple dish to fix according to what your family likes.
