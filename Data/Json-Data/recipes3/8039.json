I combined the seasonings with a 1/4 cup of flour and dredged the chicken cutlets after pounding them thin; I also steamed the vegetables instead of boiling and blanching... I didn't have mushrooms but next time I'll definitely add them. The cream sauce was delicious and thick like an Alfredo. A very easy weekday dish to prepare. Thanks for the recipe!",
