If you like simple dishes that have rustic flavor, try this. I really, really liked this recipe. As written, it works exactly as stated. Keep your eye on the water. Don\u2019t be tempted to add too much. If you keep it at a stew level, keep stirring, it will produce a lovely sauce to keep the pasta moist. Seasoning just with salt is very tasty. I added a bit of creole seasoning and thought that was nice, too. Thank you for the recipe.",
