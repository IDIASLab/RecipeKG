I use honey instead of maple syrup in the initial mix with the chia pudding.  I also do not mix additional maple syrup/honey with the strawberries before serving.  I simply prefer mine less sweet.  And if the berries are good, I feel they are flavorful enough on their own.  Also I ONLY use greek yogurt when I make this.  I just feel the density of greek yogurt holds up better with the chia seeds.  And lastly, after the initial 30 minute soak, i gently mix the ingredients to redistribute.  I then divide it into pint size jars to sit overnight.  These are perfect size for me to easily grab in the morning and head out the door.  FYI, I also like this without any additional fruit, etc.  On it's own is good, too.  Also, if you like this recipe, consider checking out the recipe for Almond Strawberry Chia Seed Pudding on allrecipes, as well.  It's wonderful!!",

I did not make the \"topping \" either but used just fresh fruit. Calories were pretty high per 1/2 cup serving - about 125 without the fruit. The maple syrup added about 100 calories (25 per serving) so I may use brown sugar Truvia next time. Going to experiment with cocoa powder and chocolate almond milk also. This is great for \"grab and go\" breakfast or for a mid-morning or -afternoon snack.",
