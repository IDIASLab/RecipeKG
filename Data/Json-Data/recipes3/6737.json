The coconut flavor was not overwhelming but it was definitely there. I used it to frost a guava-pineapple cake and it didn't take away from the fruity flavors. I also tasted the frosting at every step of the recipe. Without the coconut or vanilla it makes a great cream cheese base frosting and with vanilla alone it's a very tasty vanilla frosting. The consistency is also great (I ended up adding about double the amount of cream) and it is just like store-bought frosting...but better! My family and neighbors loved it. I will definitely be using this recipe or at least part of it again! Thank you!",
