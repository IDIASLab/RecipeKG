Not the quickest meal.\" I love Chipotle but don't have one near me and whenever I go to one the line's always out the door so I was happy to try this recipe in re-creating their bowls. The chicken and the rice here really need a zip - a marinade or additional seasoning b/c ultimately this recipe's only as tasty as your salsa (or if the black beans you use are a pre-seasoned brand.) I did everything as directed even using my George Foreman too and when every single thing was scooped into my mouth it was tasty but all separate ingredients were kind of 'yawn.' I think I'd make this again but possibly as a do-ahead casserole style but definitely w/ the chicken marinated or cilantro/lime added to rice.",

Problem was I was crunched for time had 1 hour to cook and feed the clan so I decided to improvise only 1 small thing.... Rotisserie chicken pre-made for me by my grocery store and decided to warm t up in a skillet with a little taco seasoning for 10 minutes. The rest was exactly as written. This recipe allows for significant leftovers which I love!!! I first made burrito bowls then with left overs made burritos and for 2nd day I made some soft tacos adding and deleting a few condiments along the way to switch it up a bit.",
