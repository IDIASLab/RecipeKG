I've had chocolate almond bark before, however what makes this recipe so delicious is the sauted to a golden brown almonds that add so much flavor.  I made 3 batches - semi-sweet chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and milk chocolate chips.  I gave this chocolate almond bark as Christmas Gifts, in cute tin containers lined with wax paper.  I kept my gifts in the fridge until I gave them away, suggesting to keep the bark in the fridge as I find it softens quickly. I will make again next Christmas - however I wonder do I have to use chocolate chips or can I use a higher quality chocolate?  I will attempt next time to swirl white chocolate throughout the dark/milk chocolate or vise versa!",

I used whole almonds instead of chopped and made one batch with chocolate chips, the other with white chocolate.  Although it may appear obvious, the instructions for this recipe forgot to include the final step: pouring the chocolate and almond mix over the wax paper, allowing to cool and breaking it into pieces.  An important step since this bark recipe cannot remain in the pot...without wrecking the bark or your pot.",
