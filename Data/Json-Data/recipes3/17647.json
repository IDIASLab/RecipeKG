I did notice that at least one near the top wasn t completely done and was doughy underneath. I think I d add 3 or so more minutes to the cooking time. I used parchment paper which slid smoothly onto the large platter I served it on. I d make it again perhaps not in a tree shape which was perfect for Christmas.",
