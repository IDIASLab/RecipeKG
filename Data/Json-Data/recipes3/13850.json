I had no qualms trying this recipe with no reviews because between the ingredients you listed and your instructions (refrigerating the dough oven temp etc) I knew exactly what to expect for texture (similar to sugar cookie dough) & flavor (salty nutty tang). Deliciousness!! I followed recipe to a T & it was lovely! Subsequent batches I played with different spice/herb combinations & all were successful. You really can t go wrong with such a great recipe it s wonderful as is or with small tweaks if you re craving garlic or cumin or rosemary or fennel you get the idea lol!",
