I ve never cooked with hard apple cider so I thought that I d give it a try. There were some issues with this recipe however. The way that it is written the chicken cooks so long that it is tough and way over cooked by the time the recipe is complete. Perhaps just cook the chicken separately and toss it in at the end. The green peppers take far longer than 5 mins to soften so maybe cook them and the onions together with garlic at the beginning? Better yet.....why not just saut\u00e9 everything separately and then toss it all together. The other major issue is that it was rather soupy so I m not sure whether the sauce needs to simmer longer? I added more tomato paste. It also lacked some flavor. With garlic apple cider salt and pepper there is not much flavor unless you count on the chorizo lending a hand with some flavor. It has A LOT of promise but may just need a little tweaking. Perhaps adding some crushed red pepper and basil may be helpful. I m not sure. It may be worth trying again at some point.",
