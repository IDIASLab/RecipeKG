I chopped all of the veggies quite fine in the food processor and I was very happy with the result. Make sure you cook the veggies very well until all of the water is cooked off.

I used asparagus and canned artichoke hearts. 9 eggs as earlier posters suggested. Asparagus were steamed until crisp before baking.",

I use red bell pepper instead of green; red onion; a package of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained; and WAY more garlic.  I love cremini (also called baby portabella) mushrooms in this.  I believe I've used fresh tomatoes in this, and it was awesome.  Make sure to drain the saut\u00e9ed veggies before and after cooling before mixing with egg and cheese mixture so your end product isn\u2019t watery.  You can up the number of eggs if there appears to be too little to hold it all together, just eyeball it after mixing.  I can't eat wheat, so I skip the bread altogether.  I\u2019ve made it with the 2 blocks of cream cheese, and just one, it was good both ways but VERY cheesy with both.  Adding herbs is always tasty, but for those merely looking for more kick, it\u2019s all-about the hot sauce at the table so everyone can alter exactly to their taste.  Personally, I love chipotle Tabasco on any and all eggs.     ",

Next time I won't add oil and just saute in my nonstick pan (or spritz with Pam). I used chopped mushrooms and with those and the oil I ended up with a soggy mess in the saute pan. I had to drain/press out the liquid. If I hadn't this would have been too soggy to eat. Next time I will add meat and/or veggies to this: sausage chopped ham crab asparagus broccoli Swiss cheese etc. would be some wonderful additions. I used one brick of reg cream cheese and one of fat free. Next time I'll try this with Egg Beaters. Also be sure to butter the 9x13 pan well to help get these out. I took them out when they were just out of the oven; if I had waited much longer maybe they would have stuck a little more to the pan.",

I was glad it is a generous recipe because he put a serious dent in this and there was still plenty for us.
