                "reviewBody": "I LOVE Chipped Beef (we call it Chipped Beefy at our house, for whatever reason). This recipe is fine but it's missing the CRUCIAL step of rising off the dried beef in hot water before adding to the roux. You can always add more salt later, but you can't take it out! Pour some hot water over the dried beef and let it soak for a few minutes. Then, rinse the dried beef with hot water. In fact, rinse it twice! Rinse it with cold water after that, then squeeze and chop up. \n\nTo avoid lumps the easy way, add the beef to the roux after it's done browning BEFORE you add the milk!. Trust me on this. I've made this recipe since I was 10. Then, add the milk and keep stirring. I think because the beefy brings down the temperature of the roux, you avoid cooking it and it becoming lumpy before it is incorporated into the milk. (which is really the only challenge with this easy recipe)\n\nAlso, at our house, we always added a touch of Dijon Mustard at the end, which adds a note of complexity to the roux. (incidentally, the more browned the roux, the \"nuttier\" the flavor. just don't burn it. then it'll be bitter.)\n\nYou can always let the individual diner salt, mustard or cayenne their own slice. \n\nOh! And my favorite toast to serve this on is whatever is the cheapest Wonderbread-y bread that is at your grocery store. \n\nNow I'm super hungry for some Chipped Beefy!!",

It's really \"S*** On a Shingle\" and the first word isn't \"Stuff\".  That's what the military has been calling it since way before my time.  My mom just called it \"Creamed beef\" but even she knew what it was really called.  She was just too polite to use the real name. ;~}\n\n  My mom used to make this with browned hamburger from time to time.  Now I'm the one who does all of the cooking for my wife and two kids and I seem to be the only one who loves it.  I use browned hamburger and a little minced onion and just use the fat from the hamburger to cook the onion and make the roux. Just sprinkle the flour over the cooked hamburger and onion and cook a bit.  Then whisk in the milk.  I add lots of black pepper and sometimes a splash of worcestershire sauce.  It's good over toast but even better over buttermilk biscuits.  It's basically the same recipe as sausage gravy but with beef instead.\n\nSerious comfort food for me but it's also seriously low brow cuisine.  Add a little chopped parsley if you want to pretend it's fancy.  I was a chef in some pretty nice restaurants for years but I still love the back woods, low brow, peasant food like this.  Makes me want to whip up a batch right now!",
