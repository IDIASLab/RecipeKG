I modified the recipe as follows: I used 6oz. fresh spinach chopped, 2/3 cup of smoked Gouda and 1/3 cup Swiss and provolone. I also added 2 crispy strips of turkey bacon crumbled, a tsp. of onion powder, 1 tbsp. of parsley and omitted the nutmeg. This baked up very nicely in 50 minutes at 350\u00b0. My mother thought it was very good - high praise indeed.",
