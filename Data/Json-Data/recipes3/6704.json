After using it on my pasta I do believe that it had a little too much garlic as I ate my dinner a couple hours ago & the garlic aftertaste is still very strong. But all the other herbs compliment eachother very well and I had all of them already in my cabinet! Thanks Misti for this great herb mix!!",

It makes the pasta salad stand out and get noticed. Family loves it so I make a batch to keep on hand. I didn't have powdered Parmesan cheese and don't really care for it so I add the shredded Parmesan cheese to the salad when I remember it. Good both ways! Thanks for the recipe",

I have used this to season veggies, salads,  rice, popcorn, and ice cream (just kidding).  I finally added the chives and it may be a bit to oniony for some but it has a great flavor.  If you cook it or heat it, the flavor is great and a lot more impactful but not overbearing, even if you use more than you thought you should.",
