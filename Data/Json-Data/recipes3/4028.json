The sauce really surprised me: the spices and wine create a mulled-wine tasting base which the mango and honey sweeten and the pepper kicks up with some spice. The mixture of flavors (along with the cilantro) make each bit a little bit different in a good way. I would recommend going a little lighter on the cilantro and skip the olives but that's just my taste. I also made it with chicken (stir fried w/ a few pieces of mango and honey added the chicken to the sauce just before serving) and found that to make a nice addition.",
