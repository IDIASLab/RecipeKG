Another reviewer mentioned that the dip turned out runny and overly sweet; I will say that this seemed to be the case when I gave the dip a taste after taking it off of the stove. But after letting it cool to room temp and then chilling in the fridge for a few hours the dipping consistency was perfect and the taste was caramelly goodness. I'll definitely make this again.",
