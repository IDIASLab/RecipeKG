I'm still making them I have two kids now and this is only 1 of two vegetables they will eat! This is the first time I leave a review (shame on me I use this site all the time) Everyone loved these green beans I was pressed for time so I used french cut green beans cooked them completely and added all other ingredients as per the recipe except the chicken broth (I did not want a sauce )my cousin - as he was serving himself again- kept saying how he just did not like green beans. I've read comments like this before and never got such results but this time I did! Try it! The vinegar sweet taste of the red onion and bacon just make it a great side dish I've made it twice in the last two weeks because my husband asked me to! HE DOES NOT EAT VEGGIES!",
