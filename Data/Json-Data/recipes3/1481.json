I did use frozen cranberries, accidentally found myself without the orange, and let it brew in the fridge. After four days, my only regrets are that I quartered it, and that I discovered this AFTER my Christmas Eve gathering. This looks beautiful and tastes amazing. I can't say enough about this. So far I've had it straight, with lemonade, and even with a little cider. Sipping straight up is my favorite....love it! Thank you for this gem!!!",
