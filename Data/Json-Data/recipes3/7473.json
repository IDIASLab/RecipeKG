I used fruit left from a fruit big fruit plate at work. I didnt have  grapes, so used some dried currants that I wanted to use up.  instead of apple cider, I used a dash of cider vinegar.  Very tasty and flexible.",

I will use this mix on my Thanksgiving turkey!\r\n\r\nSecond - I learned a few things regarding the stuffing - for us personally - we don't like walnuts and will use pecans next time.  Also - we will only use a pinch of cinnamon - it was too strong for us....maybe a touch of all spice instead next time?  I'll have to experiment.  Using the fruits - esp. the prunes - made it very tasty.  I will quarter the grapes next time - so they are not so visible.  Also - NOTE - this stuffing would be fabulous to serve with HAM!!!!!!!.................oh - I didn't find this stuffing expensive to make, as the other reviewer noted....I got grapes and apples on sale...canned pineapple is very cheap...and I actually used drained, canned pears - which are also pretty inexpensive.  The chicken was the expensive part!",
