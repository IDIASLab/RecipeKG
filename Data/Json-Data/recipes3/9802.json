It works well and is how I roast most squash with similar flesh, as some one else said that the olive oil smoked.  You can raise the Flashpoint of olive oil ( don't use extra virgin for cooking ) add canola oil to regular olive oil and you can avoid the smoke and still benefit from the flavor of olive oil.  Hope this helps",

A butter/olive oil blend would work better and add to the flavor too.  Also, I should've cooked it longer after flipping the squash because I would've like it a little bit more browned.  Other than that-simple and excellent.  Delicata has a delicious flavor on its own and a simple recipe like this lets that shine through.",
