I didn't have any Old Bay, so I used a combo of spices I had on hand and it came out great.  Definitely try to get the best steak you can, and I would recommend not letting the lobster brown too much as it can dry it out.  I sauteed it until done and topped the steak so that it was still moist.  Great recipe!",

The only thing I changed was instead of sprinkling the meat with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, I used Montreal's Steak Seasoning. And instead of toothpicks, I used kitchen twine to tie the bacon around the meat. I also cut down on the Old Bay seasoning, only because my man's belly is sensitive to heavy spices. I highly recommend getting with your butcher to find the best cut of tenderloin they have. It is definitely worth the money. Thank you Tina!!!!",
