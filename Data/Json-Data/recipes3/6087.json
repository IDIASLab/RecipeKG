Onions are a great addition and cornbread is a must on the side.",

I initially simmered the green beans for only 45 minutes (adding 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes to the water) then added the smoked sausage and potatoes and simmered another 45 minutes. Green beans were cooked the potatoes were overcooked. I can't imagine cooking this for 6 hours!! However the smoked sausage flavor didn't transfer to the beans and potatoes husband complained that the smoked sausage was \"mushy\" and even with the addition of red pepper flakes it didn't have much flavor. Disappointed since I love southern cooking. Maybe the addition of a little bacon grease to the water would help the flavor?",

I make this dish nearly the same on the stove in a large pot. I start with bacon though and cook that with some chopped onion. When it is mostly cooked I add the rest beans potatoes a splash of water and meat in the bacon grease(if the grease is excessive I will spoon a little out). I cook it with the lid on for only enough time to make the potatoes tender. Usually my beans are perfect too and the bacon and sausage always adds flavor. Great cheap quick easy meal when done right! (you should not need to add salt because the bacon and sausage usually has enough!) Thanks to A. Smith for reminding me of this yummy affordable meal for my family!!",

It was much much better the next day. I'm not sure that it's something I will just want to make again; but if I do it will definitely be made ahead and used after sitting to absorb all the flavor. The company really liked it. I would like to say that we ate this as a side dish and not a mai course.",
