On that note I wanted to share something helpful here. I had all of my chicken coated and was frying in batches when something came up. I stuck the ones I hadn't got to on a cookie sheet and put them in the freezer. The next night I pulled them out of the freezer to finish and they actually did better after being frozen. My point is that this would be an excellent recipe to make ahead and freeze for later use. If you decide to do that be sure to freeze them individually prior to combining them so that they don't stick together.",

I used 2 large eggs and it was barely enough so next time I'll use 3. For me 1 1/2 lbs. of chicken was 2 1/2 large chicken breasts. Some of us used ranch or honey mustard dressings for dipping.
