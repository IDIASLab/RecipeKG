The bad part is these cooks didn't know...or didn't have...the things that make a dish like this excellent. I would never make this without adding onion celery black pepper and thyme...and usually carrots too. These things make the broth taste like a million bucks. So if you're putting the considerable time into making this it's definitely worth a few more minutes to chop some veggies...and it's better for you. Oh and for those watching their fat intake just skim any fat off the top with a big spoon and discard it.",

Easy recipe and absolutely delicious I think some people are expecting this to be a soup recipe but this is something completely different.

Also DO NOT put this in a crockpot when first making as the broth needs to be hot enough for the noodles to form if not they will just turn gummy. Great recipe Clara! 3",

The only difference is they called it Chicken and Dumplings and served it with vegetables not mashed potatos. My mother would never serve two starches at the same meal. If you want more spices then add them...I prefer just salt and pepper for this dish but everyone has different tastes. If you want it easier then get store bought noodles but it won't taste as good and this is worth the mess that it makes in the kitchen. After all the kitchen is supossed to get messed up sometimes otherwise we would all be eating frozen dinners cooked in the microwave.",

I was going to give it one star but the noodles turned out very well. I added a bay leaf and seasoning salt and pepper and minced onion in with the chicken while it cooked. Then added some minced garlic and put the noodles in. I tried the broth and thought it was very bland. So I added quite a few cubes of chicken bullion parsley and a tsp of poultry seasoning. I also thickened it a bit with a cup of water with two tbsp of cornstarch mixed in to make it thicker. But that was my preference. I think this recipe has good \"bones\" but needs some work.",
