Also, one tenderloin picked up all the spice mix, so I made more and blended in some breadcrumbs to extend it a bit and that worked out pretty well. Finally, felt like i needed some kind of sauce, but didn't have any ideas what works, so I wound up making something of melted butter, garlic powder, and honey that went really well with it.  Will be making again!",
