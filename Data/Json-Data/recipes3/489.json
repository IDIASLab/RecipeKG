I wasn't sure about just using 3 eggs to the cake mix since some reviews said it was a little dry. I added 1/2 cup of natural applesauce to the batter. Followed the frosting recipe except I used regular cherry pie filling instead of light. Topped the cake off with 1/2 can of the cherries. It turned out pretty moist and delicious. Definately a runner up on my cake list to make. Thanks!",

First time I made it I only used the one can of cherry pie filling using it in the cake mix. I also decreased the vanilla extract by 1 teaspoon and the powdered sugar to only about 1 1/2 cups I don't like really sweet frosting... The second time I made the cake I decided to try something a little different I used apple pie filling instead only in the cake mix and also made the frosting with less sugar like I mentioned above. Sprinkled the cake with a little nutmeg on the top it was really scrumptious! Next time I make it I might try either blueberry or peach pie filling!!! Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper!",
