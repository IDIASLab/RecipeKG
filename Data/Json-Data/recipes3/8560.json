And what's best it was very satisfying. I made minor changes: 1) to make it vegetarian I used seasoned water instead of chicken stock. a veggie stock would work as well. 2) added basil 3) served with a dab of unflavored yogurt in the middle (if you love sour cream as much as I do this is a nice substitution to avoid heart attack) 4) topped with fried mushrooms (seasoned with salt black pepper parsley flakes and garlic powder) This adds a bit of a kick and crunch:)",
