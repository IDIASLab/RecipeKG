So once I got over my disappointment, I realized that these are those little chocolate covered peanut butter balls my mother made at Christmas when I was a little girl.  I loved them then and I love them now!  I don't have the patience (or the time) to dip all those little balls, so I pressed the filling into a 9x13 pan and spread the chocolate over the top.  Cut into little yummy squares, they are a tasty treat!",

I use my hands to mix the peanut butter, crisp rice, etc...It works a lot better than a spoon, and is just as fast as a mixer, but doesn't crush the crisp rice. I just combined it and then kneaded it so to speak while still in the bowl. The warmth from your hands softens the butter without melting it all the way to create a firm but pliable dough. Also, when coating the balls, i used a spoon and a fork. I dropped a ball in the chocolate, then used a spoon to roll it around to coat, then rolled it onto the fork and lifted it out, so the excess chocolate could drain off. (Oh, and a splash of vanilla in the peanut butter mixture rounds out the flavor) This was my 6th time making these, that's just how good they go over whether you're making them for family, bake sales, etc.",
