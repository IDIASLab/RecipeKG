After sauteing the vegetables I removed them to a bowl added the dried beans (16 oz) to the pot and covered with water by 1\". Cooked on high pressure for 15 minutes NPR 25 minutes then opened the pressure cooker and added the vegetables back in and proceeded with the recipe. I did not use the chili powder (that just sounded strange to me for bean and ham soup) but instead added some fresh thyme and parsley. Overall a tasty soup and one that I would make again.",
