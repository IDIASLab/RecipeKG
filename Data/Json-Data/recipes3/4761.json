Also used Fat Free Mayo (and I always like to cut the calories). But I like a lot of flavor so I also added about a half cup of chopped onion and a half cup of frozen corn. Also put in about a Tbsp of chili powder for more Mexican flavor. Then right before serving I sprinkled chopped cilantro on top. Yummy!! I will definitely make this again. And maybe use black beans as someone else suggested.",

I followed exact recipe directions including the black olives which really added a lot to the flavour and hot salsa (Herr's brand). If I had to do it again I would do it with medium salsa since it was a bit hot for me. I tested it out on college-age friends and they seemed to really like it. The recipe is not as creamy as I am accustomed to in a pasta salad but one could always add more mayonaise if that is desired. I think choosing a good brand of salsa is key to this recipe -- many of the salsas on the shelf looked machine-made. This came out as mostly pasta with a little bit of the veggies here and there -- those who prefer a more varied mix may want to add red and yellow pepper and perhaps even some cucumber. Good constitution though nice proportions and has a very 'surprising' effect on those who eat it. Nobody expects a pasta salad with zip!",

I think a whole teaspoon of garlic powder (the brand I have anyway) would be WAY too much. I used about 1/4 teaspoon.
