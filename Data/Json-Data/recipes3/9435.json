I came up with this recipe to fuse those two ideas, but mainly to appeal to my then 2-year-old, a picky eater who loved finger foods. I serve it with fruit for a complete meal.",

I tasted the sweet potato/bacon/onion mix before I mixed it all together and it was yummy, but the muffin didn't have the sweet potato flavour at all. I thought it was ok (although I wasn't sure what to expect) but my wife really liked it... it reminds her of a ham/cheese biscuit.\n\nI think i overmashed the sweet potato which made it on the overly moist side, I'd recommend cooking the sweet potato just a bit under, so the mash is chunky instead of really mushy.\n\nThis is a completely savoury muffin, no sweetness at all once cooked, so if that's what you're aiming for, this is great, or if you want a hint of sweetness, recommend adding a tad bit of sugar.",
