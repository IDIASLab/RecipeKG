As far as the seasoning goes i just season to taste because everyone is different & some people like less rather than more like me so with all that said i hope this helps with the recipe and to all of you that loved it i really appreciate you taking the time to write a review. On last note i also add different spices to get different flavors so to all of you who do that keep on because its fun trying new recipes on chicken i do it every time i fry it. I ALSO SEASON MY FLOUR TO GIVE A  BIT MORE FLAVOR TO CHICKEN",

I also used a spanish seasoning called sazon goya (about 3 packets) and made 15 large wings. This recipe is incredible. I added some adobo to the flour and used spicy brown mustard. YUMMY.

To add a little twist & make it a little bit healthier (if that's possible with fried chicken) omit the MSG(taste good but DEADLY for you) and use WHOLE wheat flour (not wheat flour). It has 3grams of fiber & whole grains but tastes no different! We all need more fiber in our diet. Enjoy.",

I coated the chicken breast with store dijon mustard and fried the chicken in olive oil. Honestly it was the best fried chicken I've had so far in life. It was savory and salty and just all around amazing. The spices really complimented the dijon mustard and the crust was too well-- crusty! I can't wait to make this recipe again.:-)",
