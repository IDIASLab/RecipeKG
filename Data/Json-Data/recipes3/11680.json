The pasta was not overcooked at it had great flavor cooking it in milk instead of boiling it in water.

I actually think I might even mix in the tomatoes & pesto instead of layering on top next time.",

While I did enjoy this I found some bites a bit acidic for me (and I like both tomatoes and pesto). I'm anxious to try this method sans tomatoes/pesto. I subbed Gruyere for fontina (our grocery store no longer carries it) and also added some milk white cheddar that needed to be used. This is a really interesting Mac and cheese and is definitely worth giving a whirl. Thanks for the recipe PAM!",

I used Penne pasta instead of elbow (just our family preference) and what I got was a lot of \"hard\" pasta that was sticking out of the mixture above the sauce not \"cooked' and therefore not great to eat. It seemed there wasn't enough liquid/sauce to adequately moisten the uncooked pasta. Was this the result of substituting and equal amount but different SHAPE of pasta? I don't know... I'll try again making sure to leave out some of the dried pasta if it seems insufficiently submerged to get a good result.",

I crisp-fried about a half pound of bacon along with about 1/3 cup chopped onions and added that to the milk mixture before pouring it over the pasta and cheese mixture. I mixed the chopped fresh basil with the reserved cheese and sprinkled that on top of the then-crispy bread cubes just before taking the pan out of the oven. I always hate it when people rate a recipe they changed a lot but the only drastic change I made really was the addition of bacon and onions. I m pretty sure it would have been great anyway but the baconated version was the bomb. It was a little runnier than traditional Mac n cheese maybe because of the fresh tomatoes or maybe because the fresh pasta didn t soak up as much liquid as dried would have. A little extra flour or even less milk might have helped. Not really a problem though.... five people devoured the entire pan In one sitting and loved it!",

I baked for 1.25 hours because at 40 minutes the noodles still raw and lots of milk to be absorb. More cheese and Pablo Excellent flavor I have added this to my favorites!!",
