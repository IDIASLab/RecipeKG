If I'm going to use a recipe, I like to follow it exactly.  This endeavor is difficult when the recipe reads, \"1/2 lemon, juiced\".  I juiced half a lemon and, against my better judgement, added the full 3 + tablespoons it yeilded.  My dressing was then so watery and SOOO tangy, making a very runny and tart egg salad.  I guess I'm still confused why a recipe would call for so much lemon when it already calls for so much (vinegar-based) mayo.  That's a lot of acid!  I ended up adding 6 MORE eggs.  In the extra time I had cooking my second batch of eggs, I ended up adding 3 tablespoons FINELY diced red bell pepper for color and crunch as well as 1 stalk FINELY diced celery stalk, 1 clove of garlic, minced and 1 large basil leaf THINLY sliced.  In the end this made a DELICIOUS, not to mention cheap, lunch on whole wheat with baby spinach.  Thanks!",

I probably used half what was called for and it proved to be enough to add a certain freshness but not so much as to be obviously noticeable. I loved the addition of the green onion, and thought the dill and celery I added were nice additions for flavor and crunch. This is a good, reliable egg salad recipe, certainly open to creative touches or additions.",
