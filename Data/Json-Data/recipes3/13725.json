I highly recommend that you splurge on that can of \"certified\" San Marzano tomatoes (look for the D.O.P. certification symbol, which means Denominazione d' Origine Protetta, or roughly, \"protected designation of origin\"). They cost a bit more, but are SO worth it! I made this as directed, but used fresh garlic, basil and oregano (roughly 3 times the dried amounts). I'm sure that dried would work out fine as well, but if you have fresh available, why not use it? This is such an easy sauce to make, and basically how I've been making it for years. I will use this to make eggplant parmigiana, that my son requested for dinner one night this week. Grazie, Fioa, for sharing your recipe! UPDATE (4/9/20): As I mentioned, I used this sauce for eggplant parmigiana, and my Italian husband said it was the best one that I've made yet! I contribute that comment to THIS sauce, as I did everything else the same as I always do, the only difference was the sauce!",
