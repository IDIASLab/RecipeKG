It's trial and error to figure out how much your family will like but you really can't go wrong with these ingredients. We never make that many beans but just a good sized pot with a whole onion, a couple garlic cloves and about 1/2 pack of sliced bacon and lots of s&p. Even if you forget the garlic it's always a great summer dish! (You may find yourself eating it out of the pot when finished.)",
