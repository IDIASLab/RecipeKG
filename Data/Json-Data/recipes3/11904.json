I did not care for the flavor of the gravy mix, so next time I will just thicken the cooked down rich broth. I agree with other reviewers who did not brown the meat for so long. I only browned it until all the outer edges were brown, maybe 5 minutes before adding the broth and braising it the rest of the cook time. I used sirloin tips and they came out very tender.",

I usually buy several pounds of chuck, cut it into cubes, and freeze for easy use. \n\nThe major change I made was in eliminating the gravy mix -- too much sodium and I don't like the flavor. Instead, dredge the beef tips with flour and brown (about 2 minutes a side) before adding liquids. Add either vermouth or red wine in place of the gravy mix and then cook off the alcohol. It produces a more sophisticated flavor with lower sodium.",
