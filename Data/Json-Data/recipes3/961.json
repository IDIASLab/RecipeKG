After reading other reviews that noted a lack of taste, I added 1/4 c. sugar and 1/2 tsp. salt, as well as 1/4 tsp. baking powder to give it a little extra rise and flakiness. It turned out flaky and delicious and I will use it for all of my pies from now on!!!",

As to it having no flavor we thought it had more flavor than traditional pie crust. I made this and used half whole wheat flour then filled it with the Equal sweet potato pie found here.I took it to friends and they all raved a lot over this yummy pie the crust was superior and I just used the heel of my hand and pressed it in pan then fluted the edges it was so easy to shape it looked very nice. I also added salt and shaved lemon peel. Thanks so much Cathy Tagle!",

The crust was a nice complement to the pecan filling I used for my pie. The crust was very easy to handle and had a nice texture when baked. I did not give it five stars because it was not quite as tender and flaky as some other pie crust recipes. However the ease of preparation far outweighs this minor flaw and I will use this recipe often. Thank you Cathy",
