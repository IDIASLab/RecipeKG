Instead of full breats, I cubed it in 1\"-2\" pieces and then followed the recipe directions (including pounding them)--however, this change did require using more flour/egg/panko bread crumbs.  Basically I ended up making chicken type nuggets (only better!).  Places the nuggets over Jasmine rice & topped with Sweet & Sour sauce:  3/4 c. white sugar, 2T. brown sugar, 1/3 c. white vinager, 2/3 c. unsweetened pineapple juice (save chunks), 1/4 c. soy sauce, 1T. Ketchup, 2T. cornstarch.  Boil until thickened and then I added 1 thinly sliced green pepper & cut up pineapple chuncks.  Topped with sliced green onion.  Fed my family of 6 for a lot less $$$$ then the local Chinese carry-out & they said they liked mine better! :)",

As written it is good but a little bland and since several in our family don't want to cover their food with sauce,  the second time we made she used 1 cup of hot sauce, 1/3 cup of cold water, garlic powder, salt and black pepper and three eggs.  She then dredged her chicken in flour then dipped it into the hot sauce mix, then the panko crumbs then fried.  This added a nice flavor, it was not hot.  I just rubbed a mix of spices into the chicken and fried.  Both families loved it with the extra flavors.  The panko crumbs are a must.  We plan on trying this dish by baking.  Wonderful recipe.

We had steamed white rice and stir-fried veggies on the side. My boys asked when I'd make this dinner again... that's the sure sign of a winner! :)",
