If the cookies are too sticky, the butter and marshmallow were not cooked long enough.  I prefer to cook these on the stove (without a double boiler) for more control. The trick to getting the red hots to stick is to work with another person to place them IMMEDIATELY.  At my house, Holly Cookies are a \"team event\".  While one person spoons out the cookies (and tries not to burn fingers :-) ) the other person follows right behind with the red hots -- good kid job!",

You have to work fast once you pour the marshmallow over the cornflakes or as it cools things become more little sticky (what does one expect working with a marshmallow recipe right?). I used real butter made little blobs instead of wreaths with a buttered tablespoon for faster assembly omitted the almond extract(don't like) and melted via double boiler for better control (personal preference) and then refrigerated them for faster setting. It is really a fast and fun holiday treat that gets raves in my house.",

What's different about this recipe from mine is that it uses a  tad more butter and marshmallows, which I thought might make this a little easier to mix with and coat the cornflakes but I learned the difference is negligible. Maybe I do it the hard way, but I neither microwave this nor use a double boiler. I just melt the marshmallows in a big non-stick Dutch oven over medium-low heat, which makes clean-up incredibly easy.  Work fast and get yourself another set of hands to put the red hots on if you can because this sets up very quickly! Pretty and gooey and sweet, these have always been a favorite with both kids and adults alike. In fact, they are still one of my kids' favorites - and they're now 28 and 30 years old!",
