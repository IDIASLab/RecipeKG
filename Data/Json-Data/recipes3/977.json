I did prebake the crust about 15-20 just till golden then added the filling and cooked another 45min and the crust did not burn like other pie crusts have for me in the past...I really can not say enough good things about this recipe....Thankyou!",

I found the full fat cream cheese created too greasy a tart so I used a lower fat cream cheese.(But never non-fat creese cheese which is awful I think)They make wonderful mini quiches. Don't worry if the egg mixture overflows or your little tarts are not perfect they come out looking charming!One suggestion the non-stick mini tart pans are a dream to use. Invest in one of those. The egg mixture is 1 egg to every half cup of milk (or half and half). A generous grating of nutmeg paired with swiss cheese crumbled bacon and snipped chives white pepper and salt to taste earned me rave reviews at the brunch. Oh almost forgot! Bake the tart shells off for 5 mins at 400 add your filling and then turn down to 350 for 15 mins or so. By the way word to the wise... Since I published this recipe on 2009 I realized that my tarts were sticking... annoying to pry out when I was in a hurry. Keep the lower fat cream cheese. Spray the non stick pans lightly.",
