The only other change we made was to blend about 2/3 of the soup in our magic bullet (any blender would do of course).",

I have never had Spanish Garlic soup before, so I can't comment on how this compares to traditional soup, but this was delicious!  Hubby was raving about it the whole time he was eating it. I was surprised, since he's a total carnivore and there's no meat in this soup! He asked me to make it again, and I will! I sliced the red pepper into thin strips using my mandolin.  I garnished our soup with some thinly sliced jalape\u00f1o (I know, likely not a traditional ingredient), but it gave it a nice bite. This makes the perfect soup when you're feeling a little under the weather. YUM!",
