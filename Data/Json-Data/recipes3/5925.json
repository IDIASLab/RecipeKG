Instead of the hotdogs either use boiled chicken breasts (my favorite way) or Bologna cut into small pieces.  Also add boiled carrots, which you can cook in the same pot as the potatoes.  We also add some dill for color and flavor.  You can use green onion or regular onion.  Cut the potatoes when they are still hot/warm and put the mayo in as you cut them, while they are warm. This makes the salad creamier and better tasting!  Enjoy!",
