I had a bowl of cauliflower that I had roasted with garlic and olive oil the other night - so I went ahead and used that in this recipe. I also used only a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes with the juice as that is what I had on hand. We had a busy night tonight with both of our kids winter band concerts and I had this on the table in about 20 minutes. Our tummies were full and we were out the door by 6:00 p.m. A nice quick pasta dish.",
