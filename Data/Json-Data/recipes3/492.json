Since purchased cake mix is not specifically created for bundt usage it's necessary to drop the temp on the oven by 25 degrees bake a little more slowly and test for doneness with a toothpick in the center. Pull it out JUST when done. Nice and moist. Top with the easy SATINY CHOCOLATE GLAZE on this site. We substituted chopped M&Ms. It was a major hit with my company!",
