If your mixture looks more like crumble than dough after combining everything that's ok! When you go to squeeze and shape the kipferls the crumbs do turn into dough. Very delicious. I can't wait to share these with my mother-in-law who loves kipferls! Thanks!",

I made it as stated and the dough was unbelievably crumbly even more so than a pie crust let alone a cookie. I went ahead and baked one batch but the longer I thought about it the more I felt something was wrong. So I searched and found several other versions of vanilleklipfer - all of which had at least twice as much butter. I mixed an extra 4 tbs into the remaining dough I had left and those cookies turned out perfectly. The first batch made as written was dry. If you double the butter these are delicious cookies but please do not make as written!",

They were burnt on the bottom and not cooked in the middle.    So I tried again to make them, after christmas, and did all steps and they turned out wonderful!! I cant wait to make  them next christmas and have people try them.  My husband is from Germany and said that they were great.    If you dont have vanilla sugar, and dont have the time to make it, I found a website that says you can make it by mixing 1 tsp of vanilla extract with 2 cups of sugar, mix it up and try to let it spread out in a large peice of tupperware, or a baking dish.  After about an hour or so it will be hard, and you can just break it apart with a fork.    Thanks for the recipe!",

Since the measurements were all metric I looked for a US version recipe and tried this one trying to incorporate it with the original recipe. What a success! For the ground almonds I bought the bag of Almond Flour at Trader Joe's. It was perfect! In Germany you can buy little bags of \"Vanille Zucker\" (vanilla sugar) but since I didn't have any in my pantry I used Vanilla extract instead and couldn't notice a difference. If any I prefer the extract since it leaves a little vanilla aftertaste more than the vanilla sugar in my opinion. This one's a keeper!",
