Then I sprinkle the fillets with garlic salt and press them into equal parts seasoned bread crumbs and parm cheese (I actually prefer the stuff in the green jar over real, for this dish).  Bake on a foil-lined baking sheet coated with a bit of spray.  Sometimes we spritz the tops of the fillets with spray, which makes the coating a little crispy.  My husband is NOT a fish eater, but he requests this dish at least once a month.  You will be surprised how tasty this is!",

The boldly flavored cheeses are a little TOO bold for the delicately flavored fish. I used grouper filets and because I didn't want all that bread crumb coating I just sprinkled some over just the top of the filets then drizzled them with melted butter.
