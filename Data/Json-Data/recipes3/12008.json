I suspect this will become the basis for a regular soup on our menu rotation.  I topped the soup with homemade croutons and grated Parmigiano Reggiano,  and I served with it a crusty bread and a dry white wine.  Best bread:  La Brea Bakery's Take and Bake Tuscan Loaf.     A great starting point.  I recommend you make it as written before you start improvising.  Have fun; there is a lot of room for experimentation.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I used three cans of white beans and added more broth. I used an immersion blender but left some beans and asparagus tried to get most of rosemary blended. Great flavor and something different that was quick and easy. Oh I used my slow cooker and just had it on low all day. Really a good recipe!",
