I made it because it is so similar to the Norwegian Lefse recipe (there is one on this site) that I make and I was curious.  I made it as directed and it tasted very similar to Lefse.  I rolled some of the dough paper thin, like we do for lefse, and it was identical.  Lefse adds a pinch of sugar, for browning, and some cream for a moister dough and also is cooked on a dry griddle. This recipe is a treat and because you don't roll it so thin, it's much easier to make.  I'll make this again!  It's wonderful to eat plain with a little butter or you can spread it with jam.  Try it, it's a wonderfully tender bread.",

Also it's easily tweaked to suit your family's taste. one of my  favorites alterteration... even tho It's not traditional is to add a nice slice of Monterrey jack on top when it's nearly done..so it's all melty... omg.

Pick a good mashing potato (russet etc) and for ME took more flour. Basically if your dough is still sticking to things, its needs more flour\u2026 I also think adding finely chopped onions and a bit of garlic powder adds to the flavor but that is preference..  Oh and you can use \u201cAll purpose\u201d flour if that is all you have but as recipe suggests use self rising if possible.",
