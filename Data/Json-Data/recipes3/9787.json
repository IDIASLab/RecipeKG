Great dish for those who want to eat more fish but don't really like \"fishy taste\"... when I make it again I will make a bit more of the pecan/coconut. and less of the salsa...I cut the mango salsa in half and still had a half cup left.  Might try using coconut oil in lieu of the butter.  Love butter, just not the cholesterol!",

I did this organic and with gluten free \"rye\" bread crumbs and added coconut flour with the shredded coconut+pecan crust.\n\nAlso added jicama and lemon juice in the mango salsa to make it more of a salad side dish.\n\nI had butter leftover and happened to be drinking red wine ;)  so  added lemon and made a \"buerre rouge\" for dipping just for the heck of it. \n\nAll in all a great meal for the whole family. My kids can't stand fish usually... I used cod and there were no complaints of a \"fishy taste\"--they finished it all!\nThanks for sharing, I will be sure to use and tweak this recipe again!",
