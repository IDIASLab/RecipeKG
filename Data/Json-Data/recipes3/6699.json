I do love baby spinach but I love Swiss Chard even better, so I chose to use that instead, including the ribs, which I sliced like celery and simmered in the soup for ten minutes before adding the chopped leaves and the beans.  On this occasion I also cooked the ditalini separately so I could control how much Hubs and I each put in our bowls. I also added some cooked chicken, a chopped, red-ripe tomato and finished each serving with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. This soup is one of the best comfort foods I know.",

It tastes okay as is if served w/ a generous topping of grated parmesan cheese.  Without the cheese, it's a bit lacking in depth of flavor.  By adding ~1 tsp. of lemon juice and a small pinch of chipotle pepper powder (to give a smoky flavor) I gave it enough flavor to stand on its own w/o the cheese.  Anyhow, thank you, Lisa, for giving me the right proportions of ingredients for a real \"pasta e fagioli\".  I really enjoyed it.",

The only change I would make next time is to coarsely chop the spinach rather than putting the leaves in whole. Even after wilting I thought some pieces were quite large. I also think frozen chopped spinach would work well in this. One word of caution if you think you re going to have leftovers cook your pasta separately and add it to the soup when serving otherwise the pasta will soak up a lot of the broth and you will no doubt have to add more broth to your leftovers.",

Yes pasta in soup will absorb the broth as it sits so I just add some water when heating up leftovers. Not ideal since the pasta does get mushy but when a soup is this great I don't care all that much. I often cook pasta separately from soup for just this reason and store the leftovers separately.
