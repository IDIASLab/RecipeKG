For the tomatoes I used 2 cans of undrained diced tomatoes to save time. When I added the potatoes and other vegetables I added some extra liquid because I was worried about there being enough to cover the potatoes adequately. I then added a bit extra oregano to balance out the extra liquid. This of course made it a little more soupy than stewy so I pureed some of the vegetables after they were cooked and dumped them back in to thicken everything up. The only other change I would make is to use less parsley maybe only 2 tablespoons because I felt there was too much.",
