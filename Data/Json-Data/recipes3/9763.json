It is difficult to get the seams entirely sealed shut with so much filling in them so I finally started using two cans of crescents with one recipe of the chicken filling. I also skip the butter and crumbs on the top. I find that making sure that the crescents stay refrigerated until the last minute makes them easier to handle and seal as well. I even leave the second roll of crescents in the frig until I'm ready for them. This makes a really quick meal if you use canned chicken breast as well--two 5 oz. cans is perfect. I'm not a huge fan of canned chicken but with the other ingredients added to this dish it works well. I also seal mine by bringing the opposite corners up to each other more like a pinwheel. I like that presentation better--but that's just personal preference;) This is not the healthiest meal I make but I just don't make it all the time. My family is always happy when they see it on the table though!",
