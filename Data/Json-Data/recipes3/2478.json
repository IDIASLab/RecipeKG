It\u2019s more like a casserole. This was really yummy. Much better than I had expected. The recipe is very versatile. Use what you have. I used 2 envelopes of brown gravy. It was plenty. I used a can of French green beans and pre-cooked my frozen corn. I made real mashed potatoes. I only made this with 1 lb. of ground beef. This made plenty.  I added a dash of garlic salt (this adds to the flavor a LOT!) and plenty of salt and pepper. For cheese I had a bizarre m\u00e9lange of leftover Swiss, Colby-jack , sharp cheddar, American and a bit of pungent Fontina. Instead of shredding it all on top I made a cheese sauce out of it all by melting it in the microwave with some butter and a little milk. I blended it all together then spread it over the potatoes. Doing with what I had, cooking the corn, making the potatoes, making the gravy and cheese sauce, increased the prep time considerably.  I made this in the afternoon to bake that evening. Couldn\u2019t wait to try the leftovers for lunch..delicious! I welcome different ways to use ground beef. I will make this again.",

The only other change I made was to layer shredded cheese on top of the meat mixture then a layer of french fried onion rings and then home-made mashed potatoes!!! It was a hit! This will definitely be a new regular in our home!!!",
