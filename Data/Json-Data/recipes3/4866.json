To simplify it further, you can cook your noodles, drain them and reserve a little bit of the noodle water in your final serving dish. To that water add your butter, spices, and the refrigerated garlic. Now mix in the still hot pasta and your leafy green thing of choice (I use either a little raw basil or a lot of raw spinach depending) into the buttery mix. The leaves wilt and the butter melts and you can toss it in its final serving dish. Cheese can go in now, or later on the side at the table (I use asiago, a little goes a long way and it keeps forever). ",
