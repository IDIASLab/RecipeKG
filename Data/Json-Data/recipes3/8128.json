Most of the cheese fell off the zucchini and burned on the pan. Second time I was in a hurry, so I sauteed the veggies, including the zucchini pulp, in all 4 Tbsp butter. Then I mixed the Parmesan cheese in with the stuffing ingredients. Turned out I was out of white wine, so I used white wine vinegar. Then I microwaved the stuffed zucchini for 4 minutes. The result was just as yummy as the original recipe. The vinegar added an interesting tang. Next time I may try it with balsamic vinegar.",
