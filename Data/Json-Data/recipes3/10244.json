I was making for one. I had it marinating for about 11 hours and decided to have a taste. Couldn't decide whether I liked it or not. I must like it because I have been back to the frig at least 6 times for another couple of spoons. It would be rather nice at a buffet for a party. I don't know whether it changes anything but my mussels are not bigger than a large thumbnail. Oh I forgot I did add pepper.",
