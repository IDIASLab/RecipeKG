I also added a handful of cranberries which made it look beautiful. I also used more sausage links and less sausage meat as that is how I could buy them again the links were a huge hit and people have requested more next year! I assembled the dry ingrediants the day before and just added the broth on the day. It made enough to stuff the turkey and have a large casserole dish to bake up. It was a huge hit and will now be on our families 'official' thanksgiving recipe list! Delicious",
