In the cube form, the tempeh didn't have much flavor.  Nothing penetrates through the cube, unlike tofu.  Next time I will either crumble it or dice it smaller.  I will add more chili powder too.  I served it with rice and poured the sauce over the rice...delicious.  It doesn't make a lot of sauce, so I will probably double the sauce too.   Thanks for the recipe.",
