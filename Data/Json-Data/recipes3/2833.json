I use the medium sized shell noodles margarine tomato sauce water and cheddar cheese. You melt some margarine or butter in a skillet when it's hot you add the dry uncooked shell noodles and brown them a bit. Then you add one can of tomato sauce to it. Add water until the noodles are covered. Cover the skillet and simmer stirring occassionally and adding water when/if necessary. Once the noodles are cooked turn the stove off cover the noodles with cheddar cheese put the lid back on to melt the cheese then serve. It is not soupy it is not dry. It does have a good semi strong tomato taste because the pasta absorbs the tomato sauce/water mixture but we like it a lot.",
