Instead of throwing everything directly into the oven I fried the breakfast turkey sausage red onion chopped cauliflower(7x8ziplock bag amount) (instead of carrots) and spices in a non-stick frying pan. Added garlic powder and basil less salt and more oregano & pepper. While doing this I boiled the potatoes and sprayed the roasting pan with oil. Dumped everything into the pan and topped with canned whole tomatoes Mozza and parmesan cheese. Baked covered for 20 minutes. It was juicy Absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it. Thanks Michele!",

But I found it to be quite bland, and I was much more generous with the Oregano and pepper than the \"pinch\" of each called for in the recipe. I will more than likely try this one again but alter it somewhat to zip up the flavor, using garlic and possibly seasoned diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes.",
