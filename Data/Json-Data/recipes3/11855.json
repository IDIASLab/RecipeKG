I only cooked the noodles and sausage and mixed the rest in a bowl for the oven. I melted a package 1/2 of cream cheese and a little sugar  into the sauce to cut the acid in the sauce. I also used turkey peperoni, texas yellow sweet onion, and sliced spinach (to hide it from the little one), and put the spices on top of the cheese (pepper, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, basil, oregano) and cooked it in the oven in a 9x13 pan for 30-35 mins adding the cheese the last 5-10 mins. Everyone loved this recipe and I've shared it already with family and friends!!! It is a hit for ANY age and can be changed easily for how you love your pizza.",
