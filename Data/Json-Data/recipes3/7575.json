I used half toasted pine nuts half toasted sunflower seeds. I thought the oil amount was pretty spot on. With all my pestos I add a pinch of red pepper flake for some heat and juice from half a lemon to help prevent oxidation and add a little freshness. If you are storing the pesto for a while it also helps to float about a teaspoon of evoo on the surface to prevent discoloration. We had this over our grilled shrimp and some rigatoni pasta.",

                "reviewBody": "Enjoyed this recipe! Of course made a few changes to compensate for what was available in our garden. Had to omit the oregano because ours chose not to grow this year however we did have several flavors of basil and parsley so adjusted those to make up the difference. Loved the addition of the spinach to this pesto. It helped to blend all the flavors together and in no way lent an unpleasant taste at all. In fact for me it made the dish much more enjoyable by helping ease back on the basil which can sometimes be a bit overpowering in pesto. We also chose to use walnuts instead of the more traditional pine nuts and found them to work well with the fresh ingredients from our garden. Some cold pressed extra virgin olive oil and 3 or 4 cloves of fresh garlic were all that we used. No cheese for dietary reasons. Served over spelt pasta and chicken....WOW what a meal!!! I think this recipe deserves 4.5 stars but no rating for that. Reason: I think some of the measurements are just a bit off. We used more garlic...could be taste specific but I don't think so. Also if substituting walnuts for pine nuts be prepared to use more like 1 1/2 cups. Olive oil more like 1 - 1 1/2 cups. Fresh ingredients can be more variable to work with than dried or canned or boxed so be prepared to add a little here and there. Will be keeping this one in the recipe box to make over and over again!!",

When I first tasted it I was a little put off by the strength of the garlic (raw garlic always has a little bite) but once I put it over pasta it was absolutely delicious. The only thing I might try differently next time (as this recipe is excellent on its own) is lightly roasting the garlic first to take away that bite.",
