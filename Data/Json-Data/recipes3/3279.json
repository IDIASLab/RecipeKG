                "reviewBody": "Excellent!! I tried to save a few calories by using margarine in place of butter and half & half in place of heavy whipping cream. I wanted a little color in the dish so I added one bunch of fresh chopped parsley to the garlic when cooking. We love garlic so I used 6 cloves of garlic and chopped them in the food processor with the parsley. Don't use the parmesan in the green can EVER... fresh grated parmesan adds so much flavor it's worth the extra money. The directions say to cook the pasta first but I always prep pasta last... I don't like to leave it sitting while I prepare the sauce. A trick for pasta is to return it to the pot after you drain it and let it cook just a minute the sauce adheres better to the noodle. This was an easy and delicious recipe. Thanks Jenni!",

This one is easy and highly recommended.",

I pumped it up just a bit by adding mushrooms in with 3 cloves of garlic then deglazed with some white wine letting it reduce to almost nothing then adding half heavy cream and half non-fat half n half to reduce some of the fat.
