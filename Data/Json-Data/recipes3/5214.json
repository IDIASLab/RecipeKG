O.K. guys I watch the Food Network all the time and I know that you're not supposed to put milk into scrambled eggs however my mom always did and I on occasion do and don't find it offensive in any way. Hubby actually prefers his eggs creamy so when I do add milk he's happy. However it's only a splash not a quarter cup. I never ever follow a recipe exactly (except for baking) but I felt this particular one warranted me to do so. \"KANGAROOGIRL\" I'm so sorry but the salt/pepper ratio is so off here. I adore pepper but this was too much and the salt alone will send your blood pressure sky high not to mention making your lips white. For those who don't mind milk or half and half in their eggs I say go for it but just add a pinch of the seasonings and you'll be a happy camper. By the way \"DUNKING DON\" I think you said what everyone else is thinking....",

They had a good balance of salt and pepper. Not too wet not too dry. All around just good eggs. I might have a slight bias in terms of taste because of how my mom prepared them when I was a kid... she used milk also. And so with that I probably can't imagine having eggs any other way!",
