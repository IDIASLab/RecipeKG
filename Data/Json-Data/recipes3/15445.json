It is inexpensive to serve a large crowd, hearty enough to please vegetarians and meat lovers alike, and is versatile enough to be made gluten free in a pinch (just subtract the breadcrumbs). As a bonus, this can be prepared a day ahead and pulled out 1/2 hour before dinner. I paired it with toasted pine nut couscous and mixed green salad, and it was a huge hit!",

I think it would have been far better if the eggplant was breaded and fried- as-is it was somewhat mushy and unpleasant.  We still enjoyed the flavors and the red peppers and goat cheese.  For a heartier dish, I think browned ground Italian sausage would have been a nice addition.",
