I have my own scribbles and scratches on it, so I must have changed it somewhere in time, but this is how I have been making it the last 10 years. It is our favorite pancake recipe. So light, a little tangy, and very satisfying. Perfect with some fresh blueberries or strawberries.",

I have tried other ricotta pancake recipes on this website & have not been too impressed, but this one was VERY GOOD!  I did not have a real lemon to add the lemon zest, so I added a squirt of lemon juice out of a bottle.  Not bad, but I am sure the real lemon peel would be even better.  I will certainly do that next time.  :o)\n\nI also did not have any Canola Oil, so I used regular butter.  Very Tasty!\n\nI also added 1 tsp of baking SODA, in addition to the baking powder.  I don't know what that stuff does, but I had used it in other pancake recipes & they came out light & perfect.  \n\nThe texture of these pancakes was what impressed me the most!  Moist, soft, fluffy, yet had the creamy texture from the ricotta.  They were just perfect, even at my high altitude on Colorado Springs!",
