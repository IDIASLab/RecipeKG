I combined 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs, about 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp dried basil, and about 1/4 tsp black pepper and added this mixture to the bag, shaking to coat all the slices.  Then I baked for about 25 minutes, sprinkled Parmesan cheese over the top and set on a low broil to crisp them up.    Yum!",

Mine came out pretty soggy/mushy, but I can't really fault the recipe b/c I did cut the pieces bigger than stated, so maybe if the pieces were smaller they would have been a bit crispier. I tossed the zucchini in a bowl w/ the olive oil (I used evoo), salt and pepper, and threw in a little garlic powder too. After they were coated, I rolled them into the breadcrumbs, and put them on the baking sheet. The flavor was nice, and I plan to try them again, cutting them the right way, lol.
