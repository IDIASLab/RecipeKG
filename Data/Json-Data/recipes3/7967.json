Haven't ever seen quails in any local stores so I used 2 Cornish hens which are quite a bit bigger than quails; the quantity of marinade etc. for the 12 quails was just about right for the 2 hens and used 3 pancetta for each bird. Served 1/2 hen per person. Also had to cook in oven quite a bit longer (a little more than an hour I think); I used an instant thermometer to judge doneness and ensure the seeds used as stuffing got up to about 160F since they were used in marinating the raw bird. Pancetta got a bit overdone slightly burnt at the longer cooking time so I should have added that halfway through the oven time although it was still very tasty. Anyway bird & sauce had a wonderful flavor. Expect I'll do this again!",

I suspect I will make this again with other game birds/Cornish hens in the future. I chose to marinate overnight and probably will if I make this again. In addition I will likely use bacon over pancetta in the future. The pancetta I used fell apart and therefore was lost in the dish. Thanks for the recipe.",
