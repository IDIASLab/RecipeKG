Substituted chicken Habanero sausage for apple chicken sausage and substituted chopped apple for grapes. Once all assembled I let the pizza dough rise and puff up a bit. I actually forgot to add the cheese mixture but tucked bits of it into the braid after it was assembled and that worked okay. This was really good and I can't wait to make it again for company. It has a great presentation. Would be easy to make up ahead of time get everything cleaned up then bake and serve. Thanks for this great idea and wonderful combination of flavors",
