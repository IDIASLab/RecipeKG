He nailed it the first time. Traditionally served with dumplings but I serve with green beans, shredded Brussels sprouts, or saut&eacute;ed cabbage. To make this Kosher, use schmaltz or duck fat and nondairy sour cream substitute. This uses quite a lot of paprika, but you would expect that from the name, yes?",
