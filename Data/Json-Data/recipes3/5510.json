I submitted the recipe stating thicken to your own taste and/or preference using roux and described how to make roux.  I make it as a chowder and pretty thick,  however some people don't like it as thick as I do.  Thus the choice in the recipe.  It has irritated me forever that many of the comments say the soup is not thick enough as written. This is because it is not written verbatim as I wrote it, you can make it as thick or thin as you want to. The flavors are what the recipe is about, as with all soups.  You can make any soup into a chowder by thickening it with roux.  When I make a roux I keep on thickening whatever I have made until it as thick as  I like it.  I love this soup/chowder and make it every winter!",

I made the roux in the pan with the sauteed veggies and like other reviewers was not satisfied with the thickness of the soup so I added a few tsp of cornstarch. I also used about half of the cheese and ranch mix as was recommended and it had great flavor. Will def. be making again.:)",
