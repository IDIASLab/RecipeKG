I like mine a little more chunky with some of the peas still visible. There was trace of carrots but even the celery disappeared. Next time I will either reduce cook time or else instead of letting the pressure natural release for 15 minutes I'll just do a quick release and get it out of the pot to stop the cooking process. The bacon was optional and I do not like wobbly bacon so I left it out of the IP but did cook some up and use it as a topping for each bowl. Overall good recipe and one I will make again with minor changes.",
