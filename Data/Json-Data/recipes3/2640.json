Maybe the recipe needs a more precise amount of water or a water to flour ratio. I used 2 serranos with seeds instead of habaneros and this was just about right for me. It warmed my lips and the back of my throat without scalding anything. Overall excellent combo of flavors. Served with Mexican cornbread and also with Baked Tostitos. I liked it better with the Tostitos but my cornbread was a little too moist for this soup. It needs a dry bread.",
