But I would like to add that you never use baking powder to make them but hartshorn salt (ammoniumcarbonate) and the quantities are thus: 500g flour 500 powdered sugar 4 whole eggs 2 knife's tips full of hartshorn salt a handfull of ground anice. Otherwise the recipe sounds fine hope some people will try it! It's not so easy and it's the pride of every Swabian housewife when the Springerle come out!:)",

Hers were very hard and served with a cup of coffee for adults. I will certainly try this recipe if they are half as good as hers were I will be happy. Somehow over the years the rolling pin and recipe were misplaced if it was ever written down. I have searched all over for a similar recipe this one is the closest I've found.",
