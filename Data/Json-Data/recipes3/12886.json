While I'm not a huge fan of rosemary, it pairs nicely with lamb and is quite good in this. The only change I made is that I let it marinate for  an hour just to make sure everything got acquainted.

Took out of fridge for close to an hour to bring to room temp. In hot frying pan using high heat, seared for 2 min per side. Then 3-4 min per side on lower heat, to reach 145degF. The pieces of garlic started burning  and I was removing while steak cooked.  Maybe garlic powder would be better cooking this way. Removed steak fromheat and topped with a few pats of butter which helped to make a  sauce. Let rest for about 10 min. Had with Fried Broccoli from this site. Thanks Nichole....nice recipe!",
