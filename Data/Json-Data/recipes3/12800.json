I used a tablespoon of worestershire and to tendorize the meat I threw in some beer in the meat. It was missing some heat. instead of black pepper I added Asian chili paste. about a tablespoon it tasted so good I thinned some of that up to make a very thick gravy. With the extras it seemed perfect.  I gave it 3 stars for the original recipe being bland. that's just me. other people don't like all that. I did not have American cheese but I put a healthy amount of shredded cheddar. It's definitely a keeper and easy to augment to personal taste. To me cooking should be an experience that leaves your tastebuds in an orgasmic state.",
