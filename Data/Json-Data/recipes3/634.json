The recipe says to just bake according to directions and being the novice cook that I am I was worried that I needed to add the oil water and etc. according to the box. But I didn't. I worried until the knife slid effortlessly through the cake. So for any beginning cooks out there--don't be alarmed by lumpy red batter! Merry Christmas!",

I'm NOT a big fan of peppermint but I didn't think it was too minty at all. You need to know that the recipe calls for peppermint EXTRACT not oil which isn't supposed to be used for cooking (although it is edible). Peppermint OIL is much stronger than extract which would explain the bitter taste. An all around great recipe for some delicious frosting.",
