I had been making this for years but it had been so long since I made it....I had to look it up and found this one. You can sub pretty much any cool aid flavor you want. Grape was a little......weird and so was cherry but country time makes some good choices which is what I used last night. Lemonade:) Very nice. thanks",

I couldn't find my \"orange flavored drink mix\" so I used a packet of orange flavored koolaid that's been collecting dust in my cupboard. It gave me the idea to use up all the other flavors since we don't drink koolaid anymore with this recipe. Can't wait to try the raspberry!

It is ready to eat immediately without even chilling because of the thick texture. Don't use the low-fat light or fat-free whipped topping -- it doesn't hold the pie together as well.
