First I am not sure they even make Parmigiana-Reggiano cheese - searched my grocery store high and low and there was none to be found. So I just chose to use plain Parmesean cheese. I thought I could just use crescent dough but not really. The slits where you would normally separate them into rolls come open once it is full of ingredients even after being pinched together multiple times. It doesn't say in the recipe to roll out the crescent dough so I didn't but then it was impossible to get 6 meatball halves onto the dough. I could only fit 5 and still get the top half of the dough on top and sort of pinch it shut. I did make a second batch with a crescent \"sheet\" which is different from the rolls. I tried rolling it out but it didn't make a difference. I still could only fit 5 meatball halves. When it cooked the dough expanded and the finished product was mostly all dough with a little bit of meat in the middle. My kids thought it was ok too bready although the dough did taste good. Even though I had lightly floured the surface it was tough to get the finished rectangles off the counter and onto the parchment paper. I am not going to rush to make this again.",
