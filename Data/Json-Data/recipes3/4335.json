This is definitely easy to prepare and was fun to make with the kids. The aroma throughout the house was spell bounding and the taste is wonderful. For me it bought back memories of when I was visiting my family in Corfu and is the perfect comfort food. I added the extra clams not because of just what the other reviewers suggested but because I love clams as well. I also sprinkled a little feta cheese on top and man oh man everyones plates were clean. I HIGHLY suggest this recipe and will be making it over and over again.",

I used garlic peeled tomatoes and doubled the amount of garlic called for and also doubled the amount of clams (minus the juice on the doubling portions). The flavours in this sauce were wonderful!!!! I would rate this in my top 5 pasta dishes ever. I rate this a 10 star recipe and my husband rated it a 4.5 star recipe. We would both want this again on our regular rotation. I served this with a salad and some garlic bread. I also served the dish over spaghetti with feta cheese. When I make this dish again (which I definitely will!) I will use all fresh tomatoes in place of the canned. I think with all the spices in this dish...the fresh tomatoes would be an amazing enhancement. This was a GREAT one!! A MUST try...especially if you love garlic and clams like we do!!! Thank you!!!!!!",

It takes a recipe like this to bring me back down to earth and remind me that there IS such a thing as a TRUE 5-STAR RECIPE!! This dish is absolutely AWESOME. I would totally go to a restaurant JUST to eat this meal. It's super easy to make it looks pretty and HOLY CRUD does it taste GOOD. The only change I made was to double the clams (extra clams were drained). I served it over whole wheat pasta and topped with feta as suggested by the recipe submitter. Thanks so much to Jennifer AND her mother-in-law for this perfect recipe.:-) UPDATE: I made this again tonight with what I had on hand. I was not able to add the extra clams or top with feta. Man what a DIFFERENCE!! Tonight's version was on the \"good\" side of \"Ok.\" From now on I will ALWAYS make sure to double the clams and top with feta!!",

I halved the recipe as there are only the two of us and had to leave out the celery because I didn't have any. I used small diced canned tomatoes that were already flavoured with garlic and olive oil for an extra little hit of garlic. Instead of salt I added a smidge of sugar which I love in tomato sauces served over pasta shells which seemed appropriate and topped with feta which I grated instead of crumbling.
