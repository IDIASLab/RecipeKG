I substituted chicken broth for the butter, lowfat evaporated milk for the regular skim, and lowfat ricotta for the part-skim.  I also added a hefty shake of white pepper.  The consistency was smooth and perfect!  Also, no need to steam the broccoli separately - just throw it in the pasta pot during the last 2-3 minutes of boiling.",

Anyway, the way I do it is to use full milk ricotta and whole milk instead of skim.  Of course this is super rich but it's not a meal for every day either.  I'm not crazy for the taste of parm, so I don't use that much...I basically throw a small handful in at the end and mix it in.   Also, make sure that the broccoli is fresh and not frozen.  Remember to use salt and pepper to your own liking and not necessarily what the recipe calls for.  Everyone has different tastes.  I'm sure the right amount of salt will make a big difference in whether this dish is bland or not.",

I'd suggest keeping the starchy pasta water to thin the sauce out because straight from the recipe its way too thick and dries out once it's incorporated with the pasta.

I also took someone else's advice and threw the broccoli in the boiling water towards the end of the pasta cook time; it worked out well and less dishes to clean! It was definitely not as rich as a restaurant-style alfredo but I'm guessing that's because of the ricotta which hopefully made it a bit healthier though. It still had a great flavor!",
