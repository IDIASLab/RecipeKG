I just made them for the first time to sell at a local flea market and they were so good that I had to force myself to let people buy them!! I actually dipped the bottoms rather than the tops for a more traditional look and they looked mouth-watering and professional. These will definitely be a new addition to the cookie trays I sell for the holidays and they couldn't be easier to make. Thank you for submitting this recipe!",
