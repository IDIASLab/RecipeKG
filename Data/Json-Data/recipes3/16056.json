I lowered the temp to 275F and kept going hoping for the best. I ended up taking it out at 35 mins and it was way too dark and looked and tasted burnt. Unfortunately I had to waste ingredients and toss it. I tried it a second time and this time I started it out at 275F stirred it at 10 mins and took it out at 20 mins. MUCH better. Next time I might even try 15 mins. Nuts and seeds brown much faster than an oat-based granola.",
