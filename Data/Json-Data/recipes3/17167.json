This had a very nice taste, but Probably because I'm a pumpkin novce, it tok me a long time to prepatre these. I used a whole lot more applesauce and spices for my 3 pumpkins. I ended up finishing these in the microwave due to time restrictions. Almost everyone liked the taste, but not the stringiness of the pumpkin. Dont know if that's the nature of the pumpkin or my baking. Whatever, I was asked to not make again. No more mini pumkins, may just go back to the canned stuff.",

I used kuri pumpkin which has a smokey chestnut flavour and felt this made a difference with taste but also texture as it doesn't have the stringy pulp like a sugar pumpkin. Top with some whipped cream and enjoy!! Not to mention how the whole house smells like Fall all of a sudden.:-) Thank you for the recipe.",
