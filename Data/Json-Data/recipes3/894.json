The second time I made it I read the reviews and made the according changes. I also added a few of my own changes as well... The biggest change was that I did NOT cook the noodles. I just crushed them in the bag and added to the salad raw. I also substituted sunflower seeds for the cashews. I added the chicken hot right out of the pan which wilted the spinach some. As for the dressing I cut the garlic down to one clove and only used one flavor packet. I also added one teaspoon of red wine vinegar one tablespoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. We ate the dressing on the side...because of its intense flavor not everyone liked the same amount of dressing so some used less of it than others. With the changes I made my hubby and I give it a 5 star rating.",

I followed the advice of another reviewer and let the dressing sit in the fridge for half an hour for the flavors to mingle put ONE seasoning packet in the dressing instead of two (which remedied the \"dressing was too salty\" complaint I saw from a lot of other reviewers.) My noodles fell apart when I cooked them so I broke them up with a fork when adding them to the salad. Instead of red pepper I used an orange pepper cut into bite-size cubes since that was what I had on hand. I think I might have a new favorite salad. Thanks so much for submitting this recipe...we love it!",

There are many salad recipes that call for ramen noodles and I often leave them out add extra nuts and seeds (sunflower almond slivers and sesame work well) I 'brown/roast' them in a non stick pan first. You get the nice crunch that the noodles give but the nuts are tastier and healthier. For the dressing I play around with different seasoning salts or chicken or veggie broth powder and get the same or better results as with the seasoning packet.",
