I followed the directions exactly which is pretty admirable considering all the steps with the crust (it's awesome btw) and added shredded parmesan to the top of this. I used a 10-inch springform pan because I don't have a pop-bottom quiche pan and it worked fine. The cooking time for the actual quiche was a little over for me. I had to stop mine at about 25 minutes but it may have been due to the pan I used. Anyhow great recipe - thanks!",

Some of the liquid went right through the bottom of the pan. Was I supposed to put the pan on a cookie sheet? Dripping stopped within a few minutes but I nearly set off the fire alarm and woke up my husband!",
