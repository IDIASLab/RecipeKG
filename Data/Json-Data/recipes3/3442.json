While the dressing came out quite well I think next time I'd cut down the cumin to 1/2 tsp (it's VERY strong) and up the cilantro. I think I must have quadrupled or even sextupled the amount of cilantro in the recipe the second time I made it and it came out much better. All in all people enjoyed it.",
