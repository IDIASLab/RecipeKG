Who would have ever thought that such a simple but unique blend of ingredients could make a potato taste this special? I used regular Yukon Gold potatoes and fresh chives intead of green onion, neither of which would really change the outcome. Other than that, I prepared these exactly as the recipe directs, and will do so in the future. This recipe is perfect as written. Creamy, flavorful, but with no, one dominant spice or flavor hitting your taste buds.  Pretty too!  Simple but extraordinary.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

Use good quality parmesan (not the stuff in the green can!). I've since used this sauce on baked fish or drizzle it over grilled fish and chicken. This caper sauce is so versatile but it's especially good with white fish (halibut, tilapia, cod, sole). TIP- unless your new potatoes are really small, I would definitely cut the potatoes into chunks. The cut-up potatoes releases it's starches and creates a nice thick, creamy sauce once mixed with the caper sauce. The spuds also absorbs the sauce better this way.",

Even though we were using baby new potatoes we still cut them in half after cooking to maximaize the ingredients soaking into the potatoes.  Also, we melted the butter with all the ingredients except the parm, added the potatoes to the warm butter mixture, sprinkled in the parm and then mixed it all together.  Holy Moly were these good!  Very fresh and rich.  Also, only used 1/4 of butter due to diet restriction and they were still perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!  Will make again and again.",

I felt the capers and parmesan alone added enough tangy flavor and decided the next time I would skip it. So tonight was round two - omitted the vinegar and as I was measuring the capers I thought maybe I should add some lemon - after all I love chicken piccata and that has lemon and capers. Wow! That subtle change made this into probably one of my favorite recipes here! Thank you so much for sharing! Never would have come up with this on my own!",

These are SO easy and just yummy! I didn't even add any salt or pepper and I didn't notice anyone at Easter dinner doing it either. I used shredded parm and it looked really nice didn't clump like in the picture. I really recommend this recipe! UPDATE: Leftovers warm up beautifully in the microwave. Also I wanted to point out that the \"sauce\" (prior to adding it to the potatoes) is not thin and runny... it is just softened butter. The heat of the boiled potatoes melts the butter into a true sauce.",
