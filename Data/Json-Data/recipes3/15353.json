I think that you would have to adjust this to your own personal taste for sweetness, salt, spicy etc. I added extra cumin and made sure that I used a good (excellent?)quality Chili powder. If your chili powder doesn't really taste good this recipe won't either.",

It doesn't seem to thicken on the stove, but does in the oven. Only thing I reduced on was the 5 TABLESPOONS of HOT chili powder.... I decreased this to 5 TEASPOONS. Which was spicy and bold enough for my husband, but mild enough for me and our 4 kids. Thank you Anna Marie! This is a keeper!",

I also add 5 cups of chicken broth instead of 4 1/2 cups.  After adding the chicken broth which I add very slowly to keep a nice consistency, I add it to a crockpot with bone in skinless chicken breast and thighs, I then cook the chicken on low heat in the sauce for 10 hours, after this I take chicken out take off bone and shred, add 1/2 cup cold water mixed with flour to sauce mixture and after whisking this in to sauce, I then add chocolate to the sauce mixture, after this is done I set about 2 cups of sauce aside and then mix the rest of the sauce with the chicken meat.  This is by far the best mexican style enchilada sauce that I've ever had!   and it freezes and reheats nicely as well!",

Although we were hoping to have enough to make 8 to 10 enchiladas (and have extra sauce to pour over the top)...it didn't quite work out that way. BUT WHO CARES!! It was delicious. We actually ended up making a second batch so we could pour on top AND freeze some of it for later. The one thing I did do on the second batch was take a hand blender and smooth out all the \"chunks\" to make a smooth delicious sauce. Thanks very much for sharing...GREAT recipe!!",

I ended up simmering it for 30 minutes until it was to the thickness I desired (but I think it just enhanced the taste). I was concerned after tasting it before the chocolate went in - was thinking it wouldn't taste very good at all but the chocolate made all the difference. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of bittersweet. I used it on beef enchiladas (used left-over roast meat). I sprinkled some Mexican blend cheese on top as well as some chopped green onions while they were baking. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe.",
