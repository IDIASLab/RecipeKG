Shaved steak, sharp American cheese, fresh mushrooms on soft toasted scala sub rolls, and I serve them with steak fries with chicken gravy and bread n' butter pickles...and an ice cold beer for the adults. Add ketchup or any veggies like green leafy lettuce, fresh tomatoes, mayo, or blue cheese dressing. We like ours with a squirt of ketchup on the side for dipping. Enjoy!",

After I sliced 8 ounces of mushrooms it looked like a full pound would have been overkill so I stopped there. It wouldn't have been. Use the full pound. The only thing I did not care of in this recipe was the cheese. It didn't melt. If the cheese isn't going to melt anyways I will definitely use one we like the flavor of better next time.",
