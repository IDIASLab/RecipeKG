This to me seems like one of those traditional dishes that are savored by those who grew up on it where someone else who hasn't had it their whole lives doesn't appreciate it as much. It tastes almost exactly like my mother's Filipino version of Torta... only without the rice (which I love!!). So I would say I liked this but I'll just keep making my other dish and probably won't make this again. And I would suggest others to eat it with rice because it adds to the hardiness.
