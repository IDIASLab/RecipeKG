I promise you all....replace 1 Tbs with Emeril's Essence Original.  This is the only change I needed to perk up the flavor without changing the overall taste of the dish.  The sauce is not meant to be a gravy it is more of a sauce.  It also thickens upon standing.  I use brown rice.  I have 2 VERY picky kids.  I mean it PICKY!!!  They will eat this any day of the week, probably even for breakfast!  OOPS FORGOT....ALSO CHOP THE CHICKEN.  IT DOES WONDERS FOR THE FLAVOR!",

I used lowfat sour cream , and I'm sure that didn't help, but I don't think it would have made any real difference to speak of had I used the regular stuff.  Other than that, it was just what I was expecting and hoping for.  My fiance told me that it was good but it tasted like it was missing something.  Then proceeded to help himself to seconds.

Add a cut up whole chicken which has been salted. Stir to coat. Add the broth (or just water)and cook til chicken is tender.\n\nThe biggest difference is making a small drop dumpling that we call \"Hlousky\". It's made with flour, egg, milk. Mix til smooth. It should be thick. Scoop up the batter with a tablespoon and using a teaspoon, spoon and drop into the boiling water. (Dip that teaspoon into the boiling hot water between scoops to clean)\n    When they float to the top, remove, drain and add to buttered dish until all done. On each plate, pour the sour cream gravy and chicken over the hlousky and enjoy. Little bit of heaven!",
