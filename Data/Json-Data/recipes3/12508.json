Followed the recipe with the exception of using lowfat cottage cheese (which has smaller curds and what I had on hand) and mixing the parsley into the entire cheese mixture. It was a nice change but I still prefer good old cheddar mac & cheese. If I were to make again I think I d add a can of chopped green chilis to ramp up the flavor a bit (personal taste preference). Thanks Yagoobian Pfister for sharing your recipe.",

The sauce pairs perfectly with egg noodles. Not sure if the tiny dab of butter on top added anything next time I will either omit it or increase the butter and mix it with bread crumbs for a topping. Thanks for a great recipe.",
