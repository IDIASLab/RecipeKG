Hominy doesn't exist in the Northeast - at least that I could find - so I used beans. I used two approx. 1.5 cups of kidney beans and then used black beans. I was originally going to add only another 1/2 cup of black beans but then I changed my whole approach (which I'll get into) so I opted for the whole can (14 oz?). 2. I let this cook a LOT longer than recommened - approx. 2 or more hours. It was very \"stew-like\" when cooked in the way recommended which they admitted from the start but I decided that I really wanted thick chili not stew. It worked awesome! I think the starch from the beans had a lot to do with that so keep that in mind. Anyway my version rocked. I can't vouch for the recipe in its orignial form except to say that it smelled good from the moment I got it in the pan. One last thing - it's definitiely on the spicy side. My sensitve boyfriend couldn't eat it. I like spice and I could but my nose did run a bit. Modify the chili powder as you see fit.",

I tasted it while the tomatoes were simmering and thought it was terrible. But when I added the turkey and cilantro there was a magic transformation. Suddenly it was delicious. I will make this many times. I used smoked turkey because it was what I had and I think that made it better. I was skeptical about the amount of chili but it was not too much at all. This is an excellent recipe that I will pass on to others",
