Although I loved the way my grandfather made it, I've added a few flavorful ingredients of my own. You'll love the bacon, potatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, and bella mushrooms in a potato bake covered with melted Cheddar cheese. Even extra tasty when served with sour cream! This dish is an excellent side dish at dinner or a wonderful addition to a brunch!",

As I always do with shredded potatoes I filled my salad spinner with water put in the potatoes gave them a good whirl emptied the water and then spun them again to get the water out. There is a typo in this recipe which says to bake for...55 hours (assuming that should be 55 minutes)...sent a note to AR customer service. I didn t understand what purpose it served sprinkling on just a little more cheese at the end and then baking for another 5 minutes so I put it all on when it first went into the oven. I baked for a total of 55 minutes and it was just a little dry; would start checking at about 45 minutes in the future. No complaints about the taste it was good but it s too much work for a weekday side dish.",

My grandfather came over from Lithuania with my great-grandmother's recipe that I still make. I'll post it soon. Until then I'm gonna give this recipe a chance because it's different and sounds good! Oh do not drain the shredded potatoes Kugeli needs the potato moisture/liquid so the casserole doesn't dry out while cooking.",
