I tend to keep cooked grains around that I just reheat and serve it over.  Barley is my favorite, but it also goes well with quinoa, rice, couscous, etc.  The sauce is delectable.  I like to add in a splash of red wine vinegar to the marinade, as I feel it really brings the flavors to life. Enjoy!",

I also didn't have any mustard seed so I just squirted in about a teaspoon and a half of spicy brown mustard. The taste was sensational! Just ta hint of mustard with the spice of thyme and all the other flavors made for a delicious meal. I live by myself and used six thighs so I have two more meals out of this batch. I can't wait to eat them! This would be great to serve any company that I may have. Did I say this was delicious???",
