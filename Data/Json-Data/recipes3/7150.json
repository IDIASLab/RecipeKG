                "reviewBody": "My BF and I made this this weekend. He wanted a soup that reminded him of one he used to get from a Thai woman at a restaurant when he wasn't feeling good. We made a stock with the shrimp shells (used big rather than salad sized which we think was the right choice...at least for us) and added some clam juice and fish stock concentrate to the liquid. In the soup he wanted lemon grass like he was used to in the one from the restaurant. We used the canned mushrooms and also added some fresh shitake. We used a whole tube of Gourmet Garden's finely chopped red chilies because we couldn't find fresh. We like things HOT. This was nowhere near hot enough for us so we kept adding until it reached our desired heat level. We also doubled the cilantro because we love that flavor as well. Many of these ingredients are very salty. I was worried that our stock was not salty enough and a bit too bland but when everything was added it was PLENTY salty so I suggest not adding extra salt until the end. We loved this and he said it was just like the one from the restaurant. We had a blast making this together. I would have rated this a four but my BF was so happy with it that it gets a five:) Thank you so much! Just made this again and added some mussels and used oyster sauce because we couldn't find our fish sauce. Added lots of heat and-again- this was a great soup. Easy to get down when my stomach was upset.",
