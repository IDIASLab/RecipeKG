I used a Jumbo yard egg (we have chickens) three large Mirlitons (boiled peeled and seeded) and three cups of cooked rice. I pinched the dried thyme to release its flavor and boiled the shrimp in Creole Seasoning for a better flavor (no not crab boil that would've been too much). I used Andouille sausage instead of ham and sauteed them in with the onions garlic olive oil and added in the Cilantro and thyme toward the end. Then I mixed everything in a large bowl and poured it into a casserole dish. I poured a cup of evaporated milk evenly over the top and topped with a shredded 7 Italian cheese blend. I baked it at 350 for about 40 to 45 minutes let stand for 10 minutes and served. Shortly after it was GONE!!!",
