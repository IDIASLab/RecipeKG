I would say I used about one cup of mayonnaise, not the 1/2 called for in the recipe.  I also did not drain any of the juice from the relish, just added the whole jar in.  And I only used 10 eggs (8 in the salad and 2 on top) and 1/2 of a medium purple onion.  If you use a food processor on the onion and olives it really saves a lot of time, and also helps cut down on the harshness of raw onion.  I also use the big holes on a cheese grater on the boiled eggs.  I really have never measured the stuff that goes into this before, so please feel free to eyeball it and adjust it to your own tastes!",
