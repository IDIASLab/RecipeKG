A note on the gravy: DO NOT DRAIN THE SAUSAGE. You need the grease inorder to bring the gravy together, adding butter will drastically change the flavor. We use red pepper flakes and toss it in as the sausage is cooking. You can also use the \"hot\" flavored sausage to get an extra layer of flavor. Make sure that you completly stir in the flour and alow it to cook with the sausage and grease for a minute or two before addin the milk, this will take out any \"pastey taste\". Add the milk slowly, I have used skim, 1%, all the way to cream, usually whatever I have on hand. I have found that the less fat your milk has, the less milk you will need to create the gravy! Great on biscuts, toast, cornbread, mashed potatoes, and more...yummmm :)",

NOTE: For most white gravy mixes, I use equal amounts butter and flour and make a roux in the skillet before I wisk in the milk. It makes for a better gravy.",

Be prepared to increase the quantity if you have extra people, many will want seconds! Also, stick with Jimmy Dean, (I use the raw ground kind in a tube, HOT is great!) whenever I try a different sausage, I always regret it! I also like to add a couple Tablespoons of butter before the flour.  If you're like me and only have skim milk in the fridge, you can add a can of FF evaporated milk to make it creamier!  I sometimes make huge batches for big camping parties, Just make at home, freeze in gallon ziplocs and reheat at the campsite (take a big bag of pre-baked bisuits).  Good over scrambled eggs too! Tabasco or Cayenne is a nice condiment for me!  Try these, you'll find out that it's easy to make gravy!",

I'm 4 months pregnant and have been really craving this so I found some nitrate free Jimmy Dean ground sausage (in the roll) and used Grands frozen buttermilk biscuits. The only downside was that because I used a whole roll of sausage I had to double the recipe and it made tons - guess I'll be freezing some as my husband won't eat it. Also, it of course took me longer - about 45 mins to make. I used others suggestions and did not drain the sausage but I did add a pat of butter before the flour. Also, I added the flour slowly and cooked for a bit before the milk, then did the same with that. Great consistency, no lumps! This is just as good if not better than the local diner's and no nitrates!",
