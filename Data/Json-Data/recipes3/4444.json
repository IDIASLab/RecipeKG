Also no butter or breading or you can use egg white and bread crumbs and a little olive oil to brown chicken breast or just brown them in cooking spray. Still turned out great and with a lot less calories and fat. This tasted great and my family loved it. Thanks Anthony!",

Then I put the mustard and BBQ sauce on at this point to prevent the pasta from becoming gummy or sticky. I also use chicken tenderloins that are already skinned and deboned. They are easier to cook.
