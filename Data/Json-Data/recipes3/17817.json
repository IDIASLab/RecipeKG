This classic holiday dessert is a showstopper, but it's often better looking than it is tasting, which is not the case here, thanks to a simple-to-make, rich chocolate sponge cake, and mocha buttercream filling. Garnished here with meringue mushrooms and rosemary.",

I'm not sure if there are differences in coffee liqueur as I could only find kahlua.:) It was pretty easy to make. But I'm glad I have made pumpkin rolls as I knew what to expect and have never made a Yule log before. I would let the cake cool for more than 15 min after it is rolled up as it was almost too warm to work with and then cracked as I re-rolled it with the buttercream frosting in. I think it made plenty of frosting but I didn't save the extra as I made it in advance and ended up using ganache to seal the two pieces together. It makes a lot of ganache. You could almost halve that amount unless you have plans for the extra. I made some little truffles as not to be wasteful. As far as flavor - this is a very rich cake! It was fun to make and if I want another Yule log for festivities this will be the recipe I use.",

I received many compliments on the look of it and how good it tasted. My ganache was a bit lighter than Chef John's because I had to whip it for a bit to get it to thicken up but it turned out fine because the cake was so rich. I left out the coffee and just replaced it with milk since I hate that flavor. This was so fun to make and I will definitely be making this again!",
