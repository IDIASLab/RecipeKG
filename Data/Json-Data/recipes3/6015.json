I had to change a few things as to what I had on hand.  I was trying to use up mashed potatoes so I added 1 T. of garlic powder and the 1 t. oregano to the meat mixture.  Only had 12 oz. frozen corn and the tomato sauce had jalapenos in it.  Had 6oz. Feta that I sprinkled over the meat mixture then frosted it all in a 9x13 dish with about an inch of mashed potatoes (at room temp. to ease spreading).  Next time, I'll add chives or parsley for color and sprinkle paprika on top.  This was SO tasty.  I know it is my husband's favorite but he ate almost half of the whole dish himself.  This will be the only recipe we use now.  Thank you!!!",

I did make a number of changes as follows: - I cut the whole recipe in half and used an 8x8 casserole dish. - I used Italian turkey sausage instead of ground beef (as suggested by others). This gives it a great flavor. - I tried to get rid of some of the grease from the ground turkey before adding the tomato sauce and veggies. - I omitted the can of diced tomatoes (I'm a bit peculiar about where I like my tomatoes and shepherd's pie is not one of them). - Instead of the canned vegetables I used fresh asparagus red bell pepper and mushrooms. I really enjoyed this combination. - I steamed the potatoes instead of boiling them (heard this keeps in more of the nutrients) - this increased the cooking time to 20 minutes. - I added some feta cheese to the potato mixture; I don't know if this had much effect on the final product. - I used the water from the boiled potatoes instead of milk (healthier). - I didn't broil it at the end (my broiler is frustrating - separate from the main oven - didn't seem worth it). Overall I really enjoyed this. And it's a super easy recipe. Definitely a keeper!",
