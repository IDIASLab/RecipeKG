I usually use cream of mushroom and the taste can be overpowering. So maybe mixing the two would be perfect. The stuffing was something I had never tried, I liked that.  The part I didn't like was the canned potatoes, they just had a gross texture.  I think I might try this again using half cream of celery and half cream of mushroom, with boiled potatoes.",
