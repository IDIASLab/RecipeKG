My husband's risotto is hands-down the best I've ever had, but we all came back for seconds on this one, too (even my 16-month-old).  I made it with minor revisions:  (1) I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil for sauteing the onion (grabbed it on accident).  (2) I used ~4.5c chicken broth, and probably ~2-3c vegetable broth.  (3) I added ~1 Tbsp of mascarpone cheese along with the knob of butter and parmesan at the end.  (4) I skipped the dried thyme and black pepper, and didn't add salt at all (it didn't need it).  My hubby and 5-year-old skipped the veggies (I kept them on the side), but the littlest one and I gobbled them up.  It took me longer than 20 min to make (more like 1-1.5h).  I started it out on low (after adding the initial 2 c of broth), but bumped the heat up to medium low after ~30min on my husband's suggestion.  It helped.  The barley was perfectly done at the end - slightly chewy, and a lovely caramel color.",

I also on accident didn't follow directions to a T the first time I made it and while broth was heating threw all the veggies in together to cook. The next time I was more organized but still threw the veggies together, starting first with the carrots, sweated with a lid on for a few minutes. Oh I also just put all the liquid in at once.
