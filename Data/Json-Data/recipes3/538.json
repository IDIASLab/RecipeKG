I was a bit disappointed with how little flavor there was despite the dressing and onion soup mix. I did however love how moist the chicken was and the extra sauce to put over mashed potatos or rice. I WILL make this again and perhaps add some garlic salt pepper and other spices of my own. Thanks for sharing!",

The sauce was delicious over creamy mashed potatoes. This one's a keeper for sure!",
