We couldn't wait till he had them all cooked for 5 kids. His method was to cut his bacon up in small pieces and fry it. He would remove the bacon from the skillet leaving the grease. He then would scatter some  bacon bits back in the pan . Then crack his eggs on top of the bacon, that way the bacon was incorporated in the egg. I try it my Dads way but overlapped the eggs so I was able to fold the  eggs over into a sandwich. After I flipped the eggs I added the cheese and then folded the egg. My Dad past away at 83  a couple years ago and when the all family came together all the kids and  the grand kids wanted Pap-Pap eggs. When reading this recipe it brought so may memories of my Dad on Sunday morning before church.",

An egg sandwich is one of my favorite sandwiches and I enjoyed this one but confess I missed the toasted bread. I did eat mine with a little plain Greek yogurt the tomatoes and a glass of orange juice. It totally filled me up and I didn't get hungry until late afternoon.
