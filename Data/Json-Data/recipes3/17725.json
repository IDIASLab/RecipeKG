Used pepper tops diced instead of the mushrooms and sauteed with the onions and 3 cloves of garlic.  Then added 2 containers of fresh cheesesteak meat and 1 Tblsp. Montreal steak seasoning cooking until almost done.  Added 1- 1 1/2 cups of pasta sauce (just enough to make the mixture slightly wet) and cooked till heated through.\n3.  When filling peppers: put piece of cheese in bottom of each pepper, filled halfway, added another piece of cheese, filled remaining and then topped with cheese.",
