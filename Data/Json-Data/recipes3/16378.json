After reviewing several other recipe comments on line, I made some minor adjustments in the temperature and cooking time:  400 degrees and I watched it very closely. It took about 25 minutes for the sprouts to bake to a golden brown. I shook the pan frequently. Also, we're not crazy about feta, so I used shaved parmesan instead. Yum!!!!!",

I toned down the garlic and only had pine nuts and goat cheese on hand. The roasted, earthy flavour of the brussels sprouts and the delicate cheese just seem to be meant for each other. A wonderful array of warm flavours for a winter delight! Thank you for this recipe.",

I've used pancake syrup when I didn't have maple syrup - still works; omitted the walnuts or cranberries (only when I had to), still yummy (but not as sweet minus the cranberries);  substituted the feta with goat or blue cheese (cuz that's what I had and you can't omit the cheese!) - yumm-o!  (Think I like the goat cheese the best, honestly. )  As far as the temp. - when I used an older pan for roasting, it burnt at 450.  However, I purchased a new pan and magically, the recipe works perfectly every time.  Granted, I check it every 10 minutes and stir it up, but it doesn't burn anymore and caramelizes perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this family-favorite recipe!",

The cook time is too long at such a high temperature at least for my oven. Take a look at about 25 minute mark and pull out when you see the flat tops are golden brown color. Also drain the excess liquid before putting on the sheet to prevent smoke from burning of all those sugars. 450F is scorching hot. BTW I used Almonds although I do think walnuts would be better.
