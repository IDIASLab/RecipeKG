I even used over a pound of ground pork but the salt is really just too much so next time I will def cut that back by at least 1/2. Other than that this had really nice flavor...I also added in 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes for a bit of spice and that was the perfect amount for us. I rolled mine into balls and baked them @ 350 degrees for about 15-20 minutes. The family enjoyed these and I would def make them again (reducing the salt of course). Thanks for sharing.:)",

I didn't have any turmeric which was a bummer because I really liked the nice color in the picture. I also put them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes because I wasn't patient enough to fry them up. Bravo! Will make again for sure.",
