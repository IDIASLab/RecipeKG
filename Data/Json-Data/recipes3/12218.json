Im trying to stay away from refined sugars (including honey) so I replaced the honey by taking a cup of chopped dates and a cup of water & simmering until it was a paste (used an emersion blender to help it along).  I also added a dash of cardamom and used raw pumpkin seeds in place of sunflower seeds.  These basically taste like a really healthy dessert and I keep them in my freezer!  So excited to find these and will continue to change up the recipe :)",

There is a bit too much oil and cinnamon for us so next time I will certainly reduce those amounts. It makes a very large batch keep that in mind. After two hours on the counter it had hardened into a loose granola. I ate that with a banana and some milk like a cereal and loved the taste. and crunch. After freezing it I was able to cut it into bars but they melt quickly. It is summer so it is ok. A nice cool healthy treat is not a problem. I don't know how well this will travel; but on top of cereal ice cream yogurt etc. this is very good. Read the notes first for some good tips. I used dried cranberries instead of apricots. Thank you for the recipe.",

I will use only one cup of coconut oil, and 1/4 cup honey next time though. Before I froze the concoction, wrapped up in parchment paper, I was worried it was too runny, but after freezing it hardened into a pleasant \"candy bar\" texture. Once frozen and cut into squares, it was amazing, very rich, sweet and nutty.",
