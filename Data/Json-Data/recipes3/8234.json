I like to use spinach fettuccine because it adds color to the dish. But it's ALL good! Broccoli or asparagus makes a great accompanying veggie. If you are making this as a company dish, you can serve it 'Family Style' by placing your rice or pasta on a large dish or platter and putting the chicken and sauce over the top.",

                "reviewBody": "What a wonderful recipe and so easy too! I had a few more pieces of chicken than the recipe called for but there was still plenty of sauce without doubling it. As long as they all fit into a 9x13 dish you'll have enough. Instead of buying fresh rosemary I used the dried variation from my spice cabinet. I used the same amount and it worked perfectly. I was a bit nervous that the pan drippings wouldn't be enough but I just kept lightly scraping the garlic/rosemary mixture as I browned the chicken. I was also concerned over the strong wine aroma but it came together and was totally delicious. Don't be afraid to use the whole cup. One thing I will suggest is to just mix the cream cheese soup and wine right into the same pan with the drippings instead of using an extra bowl. Not only does this cut back on dishes but it is so much easier to blend the cream cheese to a smooth consistency over low heat. I almost forgot but I used Neufchatel insted of the cream cheese because it has less fat. The only brand that I will use is Publix though. It tastes identical to cream cheese whereas Walmart's variation tastes like wallpaper paste would probably taste like. As the submitter has said you will need to add some color to the plate with sides. I hope this has helped alleviate possible concerns. By all means this recipe is a keeper. Easy delicious and suitable for company! Thank you so much for submitting this gem.",

I used boneless chicken thighs (this is what I had defrosted) and the neufchatel cheese for a bit less fat/calories. Since the lighter cream cheese is softer I didn't add the wine. It turned out wonderful. Since I make most things from scratch I made my own cream soup from a dry mix that I make. I don't think you can mess up this simple recipe. The rosemary adds something special. This would be great for company.",

The only thing I would say is that it says to cook the garlic in hot oil, and I would say make sure you turn down the heat, because I burned my garlic the first time round.  I also like the comment Mary (posted 3/26 - Thanks Mary!) made about mixing the wine, soup and cream cheese in the pan.  I agree, much easier that way.  I will be making this again, it was simple.  The part that took me the longest was chopping the rosemary.  There has to be an easier way than how I did it!  :-)",
