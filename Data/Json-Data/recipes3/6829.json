I did not add chipotle chili peppers because Ive seen this recipe before and it didnt have them in the recipe and I wanted something I could use for anything. Kids dont like spicy. I used 2 cups of olive oil becauce I like to use the oil for pan frying. Used 1/2 cup lime juice and 1 tsp of salt. Dont waste your time chopping garlic just keep them whole and put them in your baking dish with the salt and oil. Cook this in the oven at 325 for about an hour then added lime juice put it back in the oven for another 25 mins or until golden brown. Slow cooking this is the key. I used potato masher to mash the garlic up. Possibilities are endless with this one. Use your imagination. I made plain spagetti noodle pasta and added this to it with some parmasan and extra salt. Sooo good. You can also make this with popcorn. I also heard this lasts forever as long as the garlic is covered in oil and its kept in the fridge but I cant testify to that because we eat it too fast to know.",

The chipotles gave it a wonderful smoky flavor and the garlic was nice and sweet--not too strong at all (but you have to cook it on low; otherwise it could become bitter). Easy to make as well. It's worth it to try to find the dried chipotles--canned ones in adobo wouldn't give you the same flavor.",
