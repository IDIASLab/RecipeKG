My husband whom grew up eating peanut butter balls was very impressed! His mother never used the graham crackers and it was a great touch! Measurements were excellent not too sticky or soft to eat right after rolling the balls. Thanks for a great recipe! We will be making this one for a long time! I will be trying some rolling variations (coconut powdered cocoa nuts etc) in the future!",

I highly recommend it as a fun rainy-day activity that is also edible--think non-salty play-dough! With a few raisins pretzel sticks sunflower seeds etc. the bored kids can become messy happy creative kids! Enjoy!",
