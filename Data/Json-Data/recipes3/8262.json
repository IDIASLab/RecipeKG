I thought it was WAY BETTER. Still super artichokey but was more diverse in flavor. Also used half heavy whipping cream and half soy milk - didn't turn out as thick like a dip but was still creamy. gluten/dairy free option! use 3 tblsp diluted cornstarch instead of flour - use soy milk instead of whipping cream. worked great!",
