Try some different combinations of additions to make variations, such as roasted broccoli with toasted almonds; sun-dried tomatoes, wilted arugula, olives, and feta cheese; spinach; or scallions and feta cheese.Israeli couscous or orzo can be substituted for the acini de pepe.",

It gave it the crunch and the freshness that I associate with salads. The feta and olives are perfect. Unlike a lot of salads this one actually got better after sitting for a day or two. If your pasta absorbs too much of the dressing which really is a very minimal add more. I also did give it a good shake of red wine vinegar to wake up the flavors. As written it's a 3. With my tweaks it's a 5. Therefore I'm settling on an overall rating of 4.",
