Next time I will double the shrimp and avocado since that was everyone's favorite part. Tastes better the next day!",

The dressing was great (no changes) and could go on nearly any green salad. I would also use the dressing to marinade cooked shrimp for an hour or so instead of using cocktail sauce. I also think the dressing would also be perfect on a taco salad. Will definitely make again.",

I did make a number of changes (please don't boo and hiss.) because I was cooking for 1 person and you can't just have this many fresh ingredients on hand. I'm sure I would love the salad as written but I just can't have 4 kinds of peppers on hand and I can never manage to use up more than a fraction of the bunch of cilantro. So here's what I did. Only one change to the dressing - used mayo instead of olive oil. For the salad ingredients I used orzo pasta scallions red pepper iceberg lettuce shrimp and fresh sugar snaps. Cooked pasta for 6 minutes threw in the raw shrimp cooked 2 more minutes threw in the sugar snaps cooked 1 more minute. Cut up everything fairly small and tossed with the dressing. I believe the flavor profile of my version was the same as the submitter's (except for missing the cilantro). the small size of the pasta and the small chop on the veggies made a lot of surface area for the yummy dressing. Many thanks for a great recipe.",
