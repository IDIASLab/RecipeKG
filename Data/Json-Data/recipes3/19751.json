I do not cook the ingredients.  I add everything in a bowl and let it sit overnight (much better the next day). I also do not add the picante sauce when I do it this way. TRUST ME this is a winner!  I brought it to a Holiday party and it was the first thing gone and everyone asked me for the recipe.  I will have to try it Ingrids way of cooking the ingredients but I am so happy with the way I make it by keeping everything fresh.  It's delicious!",

I added 1/4 teaspoon salt (only because the tortilla chips i used have salt on them otherwise add more salt) and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper I used a little over half a cup pace picante medium salsa. I also mashed the beans more than half-way through because thats how i like them. I followed the recipe exactly how written other than the changes above. Also do not add the lime juice cheese and cilantro until ready to serve. Very important. I will keep this recipe",

As a result mine was probably a little runnier (and also my can of black beans had more water than beans! I was thinking of adding more beans since once I drained the liquid there was less than 1/2 the can of actual beans but didn't). This dip is refreshing and very flavorful! Oh funny - now that I went back to read the recipe I didn't follow directions at all - ha. I didn't cook anything - just blended all the raw ingredients together and it was still good! I'll try following directions the next time to see if it's even better.:)",
