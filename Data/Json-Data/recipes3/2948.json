What I've been doing for years (thanks to a very old Fannie Farmer cookbook) is to pound a small amount of flour into both sides of the meat (but pound it out really really well). Then season as you wish. We like more seasoned food so I use more salt and pepper. Everyone will have a different opinion on the seasoning so do what tastes good to you. For a heavier coating double dip your steaks in the egg and flour. For a lighter coating just dip once.",

I recommend adding the salt & pepper (and any other spices you'll be using) onto the meat before pounding it the flavor comes through much better that way. I'm also considering adding a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the coating mixture next time I make them. I will be making them again though... they are much better than the pre-made kind with processed beef product.",
