One note of caution---the egg whites can easily over cook so I would stick to three minutes of baking the egg whites first even if they are not lightly brown yet, then add the egg yolks.  The egg yolks will  be slightly runny so if you are concerned about salmonella I would use pasteurized eggs.  For the life of me I don't know why they don't just pasteurize all eggs to prevent problems as many people also like runny sunny side up eggs.",
