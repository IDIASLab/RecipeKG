I made as directed except for increasing the sausage by 1/3 and using half bulk and half sliced link for texture - and I used penne pasta because that's what I had.

I followed it pretty closely except I used turkey sausage to reduce fat and I left out the capers because I didn't have any. I drained the whole tomatoes and then mashed them before adding to the sausage. I reduced the pepper(s) to 1/8 tsp. each because my husband is not a fan of spicy food but the wine & spices still added plenty of flavor. I let it simmer for about an hour and it made a thick rich sauce. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!",
