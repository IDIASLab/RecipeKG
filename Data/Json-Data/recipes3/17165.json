One thing I did was to use 1 lb of groud meat instead of 2 and I cooked it with 1/2 an onion chopped and 2 cloves of garlic chopped. Next I added parsley to the potatoes. When I put everything in I drained the whole kernel corn and then mixed everything but the potatoes together. I also added 4 oz of crumbled Feta cheese to the mixture. Next time I will probably use more Feta. I may also use fresh corn and cook it before adding it to the mix. I will also probably add more seasonings. It could also use a little bit longer in the oven. It's a good start but it needed some adjusting.",

I didn't add the creamed corn and used leftover baked potatoes smashed with a fork and a bit of oil. The meat and the potatoes take on the flavour of the pumpkin and really is nice. Let it cool a bit before cutting into it or it will fall apart. I used an organic kuri pumpkin so the pumpkin skin can be eaten. A meal-in-one that is pretty easy and pretty tasty too. Thank you for the recipe.",
