This turned out to be something they could do with not much preparation. To cut down further on the prep work they decided to use baby red potatoes so they didn't have to peel or cube them and used garlic powder in place of the minced garlic. Needless to say they loved 'em and are taking this recipe on the next trip.Its a definite keeper! Thanks Jon!",

I was also pretty generous with the onions and garlic...but we like garlic and onions. Potatoes came out of the microwave just as the salmon was coming out of the oven!
