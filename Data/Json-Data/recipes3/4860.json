We loved this and this is the only hash brown casserole recipe I will make from now on (who needs cream of chicken soup?)!  I did have to lighten up the recipe a bit - I used only 1/4 cup butter, half&half instead of heavy cream, and light sour cream.  Instead of white onion, I used a bunch of green onions for color.  The only asiago cheese I found at my store was a package of shredded asiago/parmesan blend.  It was perfect!  The ONLY think wrong with this recipe, as far as I can see, is that it says to season with salt and pepper after it's done baking.  I would highly recommend seasoning the mixture before it goes in the oven.  I stirred in  1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. fresh ground black pepper.  They were not bland or greasy at all!",

To rectify this on my second attempt I eliminated the butter and heavy cream in favor of a second carton of sour cream The onions were sauteed before adding to the mixture.And I used raw freshly grated potatoes that I parboiled to reduce the baking time. For a variation add 1 cup Monterey Jack and 1/2 cup Cheddar in addition to the Asiago.Add 1/2 cup poppy seeds if your family likes them. Sprinkle top with Panko crumbs and bake. Yum!",

I would've used only heavy cream and butter or even half-and-half to cut on calories and fat. Also after such a long cooking Asiago cheese lost almost all flavor so it's not really worth spending money on it. I agree that Parmesan/Romano (or even some good sharp cheddar) would work in this dish as well. Asiago could be just sprinkled on top towards the end.",

If altered this can be a great recipe just keep in mind to be a litlle \"heavy\" on the butter and sour cream. For a quick trick use chicken stock to add a little more \"juice\" to this recipe.
