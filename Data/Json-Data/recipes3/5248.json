I brought this for a potluck to work and received many compliments. As mentioned in previous reviews I would recommend you saute the tofu in olive oil with a few middle eastern spices for added flavor (I used garam masala cumin seeds and curry powder). I also decreased the amount of yogurt by about 25% and added a drizzle of honey. Served plain (not with pitas) and it was very good.",

This recipe had nice aspects - grapes nuts zing from yogurt & yummy curry flavor- but I found I had to pan sear the tofu first with garlic and curry powder to get any flavor into it & then with the addition of celery (YUCK) I just couldn't wrap my tastebuds around this one. After the addition of additional dried fruit I was able to swallow down a bit of it (mostly felt bad abt wasting the food). Too many textures and it almost had a curried cardboard aftertaste. LOL.
