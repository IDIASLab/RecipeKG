First I used ground turkey instead of chicken which I think is an acceptable replacement. I didn't want these to be as \"bready\" as the recipe calls for so I only used 2 pieces of bread and 1/3 c of oats. I cut the celery seed in half just because of personal preference and I added a good shake of garlic powder and black pepper. I made 4 large patties and cooked them on my George Foreman grill. They came out perfectly and everyone gobbled them up for dinner!:) I made these in remembrance of our dear Cheerios--we will miss his creativity on this website!",
