Cooking the shrimp in the sauce made the whole thing taste a little too shrimpy, and the shrimp was a little overcooked.  Other than those small changes, this is a good dish.",

I would recommend removing the shrimp from the pan once it's cooked through, and then add the half and half to the pan to thicken.  Otherwise, the shrimp can become overcooked and tough.  Just add the shrimp back to the sauce once it's thickened.  Overall, very good.  I've made it twice, and the second time, added some steamed broccoli to the dish.",

Just sprayed some oil into the pan. 3. I added 1/4 cup white wine in with the shrimp. 4. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and just put the black pepper and parmesan right into the sauce. I only used maybe 1/2 of the black pepper it calls for if that. Add some and then taste as it's all person preference. 5. Used about 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of corn starch to thicken sauce. With those modifications it came out delicious! For even less fat try using homo milk and then just add a little more corn starch at the end. Enjoy",

I used !/2 cup butter, omitted onions as my hubby don't like them, used the 4 tsp. garlic, 2 cups half n half only 1 tsp. pepper, 12 T fresh grated parmesan, instead of parsely sprigs , I used some dried parsely from my spices. Used frozen shrimp and added a can of crab meat. I cooked shrimp in butter till thawed and removed from pan. Then added my cream and cheese. To thicken a bit I used about 2 T cornsarch mixed with a tad of water until it was the consistency I like. Then added my shrimp and crab and gently heated. It made a nice amount of sauce so it wasn't dry. Everyone loved it! I imagine everyone could make this to their liking. It's a great recipe! Thanks!",
