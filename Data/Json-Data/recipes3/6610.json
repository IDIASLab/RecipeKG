Served with fresh grated parmesan cheese - this recipe is amazingly yummy!!! Made it for my mother in law's birthday - whole family loved it!",

If I make it again I will add fresh basil or cilantro on the top. Also you need to double the amount of sauce if you have more than 3 people. My sauce was not sweet like other people said, it was perfect in flavor, I think it was too sweet for other people because of the wine they used. My sauce was too watery so next time I will add some thickener to it. The best part of this recipe was the shrimp. ",

Hubby is Italian and makes his own sauces which simmer for at least 4 days, we were looking for a quick and easy dish to take to a potluck.  This worked wonderful for that.
