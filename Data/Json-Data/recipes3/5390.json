I suggested the boiling method because the veggies will cook much faster, but in fact, I prefer to stir-fry my veggies as opposed to boiling. Please do which ever you prefer and feel free to add or take away ingredients at your leisure, this recipe is very forgiving. Also, use as much or as little garlic oil as you desire to toss your noodles in. I will sometimes add some salt and soy sauce to toss my noodles in along with the oil to add some extra flavor. If your not a cilantro lover, I recommend tossing in some extra chopped green onions. Happy Cooking.",

Tossing the noodles with the garlic oil is a must! I doubled the veggie amounts used olive oil instead of the veg oil omitted the cilantro and squeezed a little lime juice over the dish when it was done. Fantastic! I would also recommend using a good quality soy sauce (like Kikkoman) instead of the thick cheap salty stuff. Thank you this is definitely a keeper.",

I did use the pasta water as it was still hot to quickly cook my chopped veggies. I used a pasta spoon to get the linguine out of the pot and then threw my chopped veggies in the water. I served it on a large meat platter and it was beautiful. I topped it with freshly grated parmesean cheese. I used the soy sauce and the lime juice but no cilantro. Great recipe that makes a lot of food and looks great!",

I followed the recipe almost to the \"T\" except that I used a little less oil (and Olive instead of vegetable oil). In the future I would not heat the oil as long before I added the garlic. The problem I had is once they turned \"golden brown\" I removed the pan from the heat as specified - but the oil was still hot enough that the garlic continued to cook going into the very dark brown range. Other than that everything went very well and I would make this again.",
