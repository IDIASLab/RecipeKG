The red potatoes and red onions add beautiful color. The oriinal ingredients while good where a bit blan. This was a huge success and everyone wanted the recipe and got seconds. I also put a side of crispy bacon bits to sprinkle on the top after spooned into the bowls! PERFECTO!",

I also used much more potatoes and veggies as I was really trying to maximize the recipe. Instead of 2 cans of corn I took a previous reviewers advise and used one can of creamed corn and one regular (Del Monte Summer Crisp). I also used 1C 2% milk and 1C half and half in order to add to the creaminess of the chowder. I think the most important step was that I removed about 1/3 of the potatoes after they were cooked as well as a handful of other veggies blended them with an immersion blender and added them back into the soup. It made a super amazing texture. I will be making this again and am already taking requests from my family and coworkers for another batch!",
