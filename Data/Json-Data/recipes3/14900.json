I let it marinate for 5 hours and that was not enough.  Also, be sure to keep the onions- don't throw them away after you have drained the water off! Marinate them with the chicken, bake them, and serve them.  Each time I have made this dish, my guests have gone nuts for the onion pieces, which somehow do an amazing job of carrying the various flavors of clove, cinnamon, and ginger.  The onions are so popular that I now use them to compliment other dishes, such as smoked fish, baked sweet potatoes, and roast turkey.",
