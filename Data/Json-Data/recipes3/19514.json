I cooked it at 325 deg for about 30 minutes - I had a pound-and-a half of the fillet - I thoroughly sprinkled both sides with lemon pepper and brushed about a teaspoon of melted unsalted butter.   I wrapped the pan with foil and sprayed non-stick oil before placing the salmon.  I baked covered with foil for 10 minutes, then removed the foil cover for the rest of the cooking time or until the fish is well done.   I forgot the lemon juice right before serving with brown rice but it didn't make a difference... my husband loved it!!",

Because I also used a thick fillet with the scales still on I just made sure that I first cooked the \"top\" side and then flipped over to the scale side. It had to cook a little longer than I thought and the scale side made quite a mess in the pan and started to burn just a little. The meal itself though was wonderful. When I usually make this I bake in the oven on about 325. I have to say the oven is easier and not as messy but I liked the extra little crunch (for lack of a better word) that the top of the fillet had from cooking on the stove top.",

I don't like lemon pepper seasoning but what I do is that I melt the butter and garlic over medium heat, then I squeeze half a lemon in (sometimes a whole one - depends on how strong a lemon flavor I want) and mix the butter, garlic, and lemon juice together. Then I put in the salmon fillets. The heat is on either medium or medium low (depends on the thickness). Once it looks like it's cooked half way through, I flip it. One time I accidentally over cooked the salmon on one side and I was sure it would taste gross but it was surprisingly good because the butter had formed a crust and locked in a lot of the flavor on that side. Lucky me! Once it's done cooking, I plate and serve. No need to sprinkle with lemon juice because it already cooked in lemon juice. Enjoy!",
