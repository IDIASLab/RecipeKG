The only thing I changed was adding some zucchini squash and carrots that I had run through the food processor. I used the 7% fat ground beef and still had quite a bit of grease that I poured out of the pan maybe from the cheese. The meatloaf did not slice neatly and looked pretty unappetizing so I was prepared for us to look for an alternative dinner. I was wrong it was really good (and remember I don't like meatloaf). My husband took one bite and said \"This may be one of my favorite meals that you make.\" Wow!! I'll definitely make it again.",

I didn't have any \"buttery crackers\" but I did have saltines. So I crushed about 20 and melted a half stick of butter and mixed the two. I also didn't have shredded swiss but I had deli slices! So in the meatloaf I used a parm/oreg cheese blend. And on top I used sliced swiss to melt! Also I used thyme instead of sage and garlic powder instead of chopped garlic. I also added some savory seasoning for added flavor! All in all this was an excellent dinner! Quick Easy and GOOD! Great recipe thanks so much!",
