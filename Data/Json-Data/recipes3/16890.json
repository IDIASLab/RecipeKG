Popping your own popcorn on the stove prevents this and is just as fast.\n2. Put a couple cubes of caramel in the marshmellow sauce, this really makes a diffence! I did one sauce with and one without...the caramels add something that was lacking.\n3. For a more vibrant orange use 4 drops of red and 5 drops of yellow.\n4. Add few loose marshmellows to the popcorn mixture.\n5. To evenly distribute the candy corn and peanuts, pour them ontop of the popcorn and then pour the sauce.",

I did use the licorice and it took a lot more yellow food colouring to get orange. The only problem I had was that there was way too much butter. Next time I would use half as much because I ended up with a pool of it separating from the marshmallow after melting and mixing them together. It was fun though and we certainly don't regret trying the recipe! I will try it again with a few more changes and maybe I'll add some Rice Krispies or corn flakes in with the popcorn.
