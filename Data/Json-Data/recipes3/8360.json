We didn't have broccoli rabe at our store, so I used baby broccoli instead - not sure how much that affected the flavor of the dish (which was really good!!) or the veggie-to-pasta ratio. I will probably increase the amount of pasta when I make it again, but overall it is a very good dish with great flavor that goes well with some warm, crusty bread for sopping up the juice - YUM!!",

The wine added beautiful depth to the dish along with grated Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan. I am infamous for doctoring recipes but truthfully there was little that needed changing here!
