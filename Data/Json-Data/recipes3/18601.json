The difficulty when baking eggs is to get the whites cooked evenly yet have the yolk still be runny. That's why the eggs are baked in two stages: first just the egg white is baked with cream and salmon, and the yolk is added later. Scale up the recipe as needed.",

I did second batch increased the temp and time and this time the egg white did seem to cook but the cream had melted in\u2026 again the TASTE was fine but I have to think you can get this taste without the hassle of a ramekin bath etc\u2026  I personally wont be doing this again.
