Just a few modifications: I used a 12oz package of kielbasa links and a pre-chopped pre-washed 10 oz bag of kale and about double the broth to allow for the larger amount of kale. I also took a tip from another reviewer and let the kale cook longer before adding the beans. I'd recommend using low or no-salt broths as the kielbasa was quite salty already so I added a couple of diced potatoes to offset the salt.",
