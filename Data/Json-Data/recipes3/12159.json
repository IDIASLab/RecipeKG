(I did prebake it) the filling was really good - I might add some hot sauce or something next time.  the veggies were kind of hard to slice - using a vegetable peeler was a little difficult, but it came out OK -- I used zucchini, summer squash, and carrots.  It really was very pretty!  I baked it for about 10 extra minutes.  You need to let it cool for a while before you eat it or the inside is all gooey - it won't come out in a slice.  I will make this again.\n\nETA:  I've made this a couple times now, experimenting each time - most recent change is to sautee some onions and stir them into the cheese mixture .  very good!",

I wish the recipe would have said which setting to use on the mandoline. I couldn't roll the veggies so I had to modify by wrapping the veggies around the perimeter working my way inward. They were still too crunchy after baking for 40 mins plus the 4 mins in the microwave because of the thickness. Wish I could upload a picture. Next time I will slice my veg on the thinnest setting on the mandoline. Other than that the flavor was awesome!! I was very pleased overall with this recipe.",

How much exactly is a pinch of nutmeg and how can a salt to taste if the recipe has eggs in it? So until it was done baking I was just hoping the seasonings were all right. I also had a hard time making the roses. I couldn't get my veggie strips tender enough to role tight roses. What I ended up with was still cute but not exactly what I was hoping for. That all said I'm a sucker or beautiful things so I would probably make it again. I would just try a few this differently next time.",
