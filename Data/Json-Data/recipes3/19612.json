        "description": "This is an Austrian classic. 'Knodel' (you pronounce the \"k\") means 'dumpling' in German.  My mother used to make this a lot when I was small because it's a good way to use up stale bread.  It remains one of my fondest childhood taste memories.  The quantities are approximate, because this is one of those recipes that isn't written down, so I had to follow her around the kitchen the last time she made it.  Be sure the bread is stale.  If it isn't, dry it in the oven after cutting it into cubes.",

But then I formed them into firms balls the size of a small hardball and placed them into slightly salted boiling water.  When they rose to the surface, I turned the heat down to a soft boil and covered the pot.  Ten minutes later they're done and awsome!  Everyone loves them.  A great recipe.  My whole family raves every time I make this and requests it often.  A great way to soak up gravy or sauce.   If there are any leftovers (and there usually aren!t) I cut them up the next morning and put them in the frypan with a couple of eggs and sometimes ham, red pepper, etc... and they are gone!  A real soul food.",

With bacon they are often called Tiroler Knoedel (from Tyrol). Very good thanks for sharing. The only thing is that Knodel are Bread dumplings and are formed into balls.

I didn't know what it was at the time and actually thought they were well-boiled potatoes or something. Now I know! Mine didn't turn out exactly like I had in Austria but it was good. I didn't have a pan larger than 9 x 11 so I turned the oven on to 275 degrees and had a big pan full of water heat up for an hour to steam. Then I put the pan of knodel in the oven with the foil wrapped tightly on it. The bread was still pretty firm. The taste was good but the texture was slightly off. I'm sure it was my cooking technique.",
