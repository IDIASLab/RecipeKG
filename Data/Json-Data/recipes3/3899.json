It is also a non-hassle recipe for you working folks, single folks, or even for kids to make! You can even make it ahead of time by preparing the casserole and then freezing it - for up to 3months! My family loves this casserole and we change things around in it, by adding or taking out different things. Have fun with it, and I would love to hear comments on what worked for you and what changes you made! Serve with dinner rolls or French bread and a salad!",

Just make extra sauce and toss it with the noodles before you put them in the baking dish,then do your layering. When you layer it and add the rest of the sauce,all of it will be moist and delish. Problem solved. This recipe is just a blue print. You can do anything with it. Add fresh garlic,thyme,rosemary, or use a shallot instead of just onion.

Like others, I tweaked a few things. I baked 4 chicken breasts that were sprinkled with garlic powder, lemon pepper and dill, cooked the pasta in the broth that went into the sauce, chopped and steamed a head of fresh broccoli and mixed everything together (including all of the cheese) rather than layering. The sauce melted the cheese and created this wonderfully cheesy gooeyness all through the dish :)! I didn't bother doubling the sauce, and didn't think it was dry at all. Last, I cooked it for 35 minutes to get everything bubbling nicely. Yum!",

I was afaid we wouldn't like it, since we like very spicy foods with lots of flavor, but this was great & very simple. After reading the reviews I made a few changes. I used fesh broccoli, we don't like frozen (to many stems) & used swiss & cheddar. Instead of layering the ingred., I mixed them all together w/ 8oz grated swiss cheese. Then I doubled the sauce & poured it over the top, finishing w/ the grated cheddar. Wow.  I love to cook & try different things so we rarely eat the same thing twice even when its really good, but this is definetly something I will make regularly.",

Also I put about 1/4 of the mixture right on top of the noodles before the chicken so that the noodles wouldn't be dry. I also added some garlic powder and onion powder in with the soup/onion mixture. Last I layered about 1/3 of the cheese right on top of the chicken to get that flavor throughout and used swiss in addition to the provolone and chedder.

After cooking & removing the chicken from the pan I sauteed the onions in the same skillet and also added a couple of cloves of chopped garlic. When I added the chicken broth I scraped up the brown bits left from the chicken in the bottom of the pan. I also added a few hearty dashes of cayenne & cumin to the sauce. I didn't have any provolone cheese on hand so I substituted some mozzarella & swiss to go along with the cheddar. I also used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. I ended up with a great dish that I'll most likely try again. I think that there is an endless possibility of variations that can be made to this dish depending on what you have on hand.

For the sauce I doubled it and added a generous dash of cayenne and curry. Then I added shredded cheddar directly to the sauce until melted. Next I layered the ingredients as recommended but sprinkled parmesan (instead of provolone) on top of everything before pouring on the sauce. I then put a bit more shredded cheddar & parmesan over the top prior to baking. It was very tasty and had just the right \"zip\" without being too spicy. I would definitely make it again.",
