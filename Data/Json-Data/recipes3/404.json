As I mixed the batter up it smelled strange. As it baked it smelled no differently - but I kept my fingers crossed while thinking \"I'll bet it's the Jell-0.\" I plowed on glazing the little egg cakes I made decorating them and then I took a bite - and it tasted exactly like it smelled. It was acrid and artificial tasting almost chemical-y. I had a vague memory of some medicine I had as a child. Maybe it's just that I don't care for Jello-o in cake batter but it...was...not...good. Very off tasting. Unfortunately.",
