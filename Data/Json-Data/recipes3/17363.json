Substituted a double amount of wheat germ for bread crumbs. (I always find this tastier than bread crumbs in recipes) And spiced the meat to our taste. Topped with thawed and drained chopped frozen spinach and then the final Mozarella. Baked for 40 minutes and then changed the oven to top grill at a higher heat to brown it off for ten. Came out looking and smelling fantastic. Family ate every last bit!",
