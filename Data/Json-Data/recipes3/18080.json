Other than these slight changes, I followed the recipe, exactly.  We will have leftovers for lunch this week, and I'm happy about that.  Thanks for the idea.

I added 2 chopped up Roma tomatoes which I can't say I really tasted or so take it or leave it. The frozen corn seems like a good idea and maybe some tortilla s strips. I added 3 medium sized potatoes cut in chunks when the onion peppers tomatoes etc. was added as the dish needed some starch (pasta or rice as others suggested). The boiled chicken taste rubbery to me even though it was easy. I suggest buying a rotisserie chicken and adding it at the end no skin.",

I did change the procedure a bit. I cubed the thighs and cooked them before the pancetta to seal the chicken. After adding the broth I added both the pre cooked chicken pieces and the pancetta to the mix and proceeded to simmer as directed. The soup was flavorful. Just keep in mind that doing this will require you to be careful with the amount of additional salt you add to the recipe. Pancetta is very salty so you can reduce the amount of salt that the recipe calls for. The broth might \"taste bland\" but once you take a spoonful with the pancetta the salt amount is actually just right.",
