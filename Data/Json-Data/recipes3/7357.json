I tweaked it a bit: used half the avocado (I like a salad to have more of a varied texture) fresh garlic fresh roasted green chiles instead of jalapenos and just a drizzle of olive oil (the avocados add enough of a creamy texture). I thought it could have used more lime juice for more of a vinegary bite but my lime was pretty dry. I added hot sauce and that put it over the edge.",
