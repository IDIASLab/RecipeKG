I make this when company comes over, and they all rave about it. It's the feta cheese that gives it a gourmet flavor, and the crust comes out very flakey and buttery. Marinated beef cuts also work well.",

I used a medium sized tomato and drained off as much grease as possible before adding the tomato. After adding the tomato I ran off enough excess liquid to keep the pies from getting too sloppy and the remaining juice was 90% from the tomato and flavored with all the great spices thrown into the meat. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and set the oven to 375 and cooked everything for about 20 minutes. I also ran out of pie before filling like other reviewers so next time I'm getting more pie dough or halfing the filling and just making enough for two people. Still this recipe got a great response. My boyfriend says I have now hooked him on feta and I thought the pie was really rich with the cayenne pepper and other seasoning coming through beautifully.",

I also use Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts and cut them in quarters making the pies with thoes instead of cutting circles No waste!!! I will add black olives next time. also I found that the pies were brown after 18 mins so I might lower the oven temp next time to 375 so the cheese gets a chance to melt more.",

Secondly I doubled the spices (except for the red pepper). Thirdly after reading the reviews and discovering that I didn't have any tomatoes anyway I substituted salsa for the tomato. This worked out great - the pies weren't dry at all. I added the salsa last so I just kept adding until the mixture had a good consistency. I used at least a half-cup of salsa by the time I was done. I also diced the small onion instead of just slicing it. Finally I added a small handful of grated cheddar to the top of each pie before putting on the upper crust. While it's hardly necessary I think that made them even better -- I love the combined taste of cheddar and pie crust. I'll be making these again soon. We have a lot of ground venison and this is a great way to use a pound.",
