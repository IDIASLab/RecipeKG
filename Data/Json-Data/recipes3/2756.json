I had to double the recipe to feed everyone so I sauted the garlic with some chopped onion in the olive oil until soft.  I then added 1 can of low fat chicken broth, a little white wine and both sun-dried tomatoes and some chopped Roma tomatoes and let this simmer while the pasta cooked.  The smell was unbelievable!  I used fresh basil and tossed in some sliced olives. Tossed all together, and then gently stirred in the cheeses at the last.  My son said it was a gourmet meal!  We might try throwing in some shrimp or chicken strips next time, although with a salad and some french bread, its a complete, wonderful meal.  Thank you for sharing!!",

By idea and suggestion of a few other users I sauteed garlic onion tomato basil and olives in a little bit of olive oil before adding to the pasta. I then added the feta and stirred. The only other things I added were salt and pepper. I did sprinkle parmesan on one serving and none the next - I liked it better without.

It can be served warm or cold. I found I really enjoyed it better the next day and added some red pepper flakes kalamata olives and a splash of balsamic vinegar.
