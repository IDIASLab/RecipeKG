I followed the advice of many of the other reviewers on here by adding 2 large, sliced, granny smith apples, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and 2 16-ounce jars of sauerkraut.  My crock pot seems to need extra help with roasts, so I cooked mine for roughly six hours on low with an additional four hours on high.  The meat was falling-apart-tender, and the kraut had just the right amount of sweet and sour to it...served this with garlic mashed potatoes.  Looking forward to the leftovers tonight!  Thank you for the great recipe!!",

Well, here is my recipe!  The only changes I make personally is that I start the stuff on New Years Eve before we go to bed and let it cook all night and all day before we eat it.  I add brown sugar to take the bite away from the kraut (about 2 tablespoons).  The longer it cooks, the better.  It gets nice and browned and my family loves this once a year treat.  We serve with mashed potatoes and applesauce and dinner rolls.  This is THE lucky New Years Day dish to be served for good fortune.  Even better reheated the next day.",

I took one 16 oz. bag of Boar's Head Sauerkraut and layered that on the bottom.  Then sprinkled some of the caraway seeds and put the pork in with some salt, pepper, and a little brown sugar. I cut up a large granny smith apple and put that over the pork and then added the other bag of sauerkraut and sprinkled some more caraway seeds.  I added just a little bit of water and set the crock pot on low for 8 hours.  The pork was falling apart.  It went great with Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes and some sweet peas and for dessert Nutty Apple Crisp.",
