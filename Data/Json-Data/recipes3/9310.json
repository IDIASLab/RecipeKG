I would reccomend using a large non stick Dutch oven.  I used a stainless saute pan and had to keep waiting for the kale to decrease in volume before I could add more.  I was afraid all the spices were stuck to the bottom of the pan and there would be no spices left for the kale, but this was loaded with flavor and truely unique.",

I had a feeling kale and potatoes would be good together, so I looked for recipes using both.I reduced the amount of curry powder just a tad, and I'm glad I did. I meant to add cayenne pepper but forgot. I don't miss it even though I like spicy food. My only complaint is the amount of butter. I thought this was too fatty overall, and will adjust the butter and oil amounts in the future. Great recipe, thanks! EDIT: I made this again, but forgot to check my previous review and used the full amount of butter. still too much, lol! definitely reduce the butter unless you want it pooling in the bottom of the pan (waste of butter). I used a mandolin slicer and yellow potatoes so I didn't have to peel. I used some nice aged white cheddar for the topping. The diections don't say to cover while baking, but I found mine cooked perfectly and right on time with it covered, and only uncovered for the cheese to bubble and brown. This recipe is so cheap and so easy!!",

I ended up using 4, two of which I would consider extra large. Made 3 layers of potatoes in 9x13 pan. Came out perfect. I think the recipe needs some salt and pepper added. Maybe just sprinkle on the potato layers as they are being added. I ended up using green beans instead of kale since that's what needed used up from our garden share.With only potatoes and one veggie, it seems lacking as a meal. And I got to thinking, you know what would be great in this? Some ground beef! And some carrots. Maybe mushrooms.  A very versatile dish that I will play around with.",

I didn't bother to melt the butter I just dotted the top with about 2 Tbs of butter and I didn't add the cheese. I served mine with a spoonful of plain yogurt which I really liked. My 7 year old daughter ate hers with ranch dressing...kids are so weird...and loved it. I like what the other reviewers said about maybe adding chickpeas for protein next time. It has only been an hour and a half since lunch and I'm hungry again...could just be me though...maybe the cheese would have kept me satisfied longer. Thanks for the great recipe!",
