The daikon pickles are decent though certainly not the same style as you'd get at one of the few Chinese restaurants that have them. As for how I made them I peeled the daikon (the recipe skipped this step) then chopped it. Because the recipe didn't say I chopped it into 3/4 inch cubes. It took about half a large daikon to make 1 1/2 cups of chopped daikon. And indeed in step one they did release two tablespoons of water. In step two I skipped the optional sesame oil.",
