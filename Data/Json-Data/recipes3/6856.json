I had a hectic family day and knew dinner was going to have to be fast and on the fly so I took a chance on speeding it up. I doubled the recipe and \"made\" buttermilk by adding 1 Tb of white vinegar for each cup of milk and let it sit for 10 min before adding it to the recipe. (You can also use lemon juice.) I put every single ingredient except the meat in a large bowl and beat the tar out of it until it was a thick batter and free of lumps - like pancake batter. It required a little more flour to accomplish this so I added more spices to compensate. I cut up the meat tossed it in the batter mixed it to coat then covered it and threw it in the fridge for the afternoon. When I got home I heated up the Fry Daddy and mixed the meat/batter again. WARNING - using the frying basket did not work for me at all!! The batter oozed into the drain holes and the meat stuck to the bottom of the basket. I could not get it off until the basket cooled and I could safely take a fork to it and break the meat/batter apart. However removing the fry basket and putting the battered meat directly into the Fry Daddy worked like a charm! It took a little longer than 5 minutes per batch to get that beautiful brown coating but it was so worth it! The kids were waiting in line by the fryer because they were eating them faster than I could cook them!! Thank you so much for the great recipe!",
