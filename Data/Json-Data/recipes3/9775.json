Crunch instead of the cereal and candy bars. I also bumped up the peanut butter to 1/2 cup and the pretzels up to 2 cups (since I was taking out the Chex) to make it more nutritious and sent them with my hubby on an eight day bike ride. All his friends thought I was wonderful!",

However, I used no Chex; I doubled the pretzels and added 2 cups crisp rice cereal (Rice Krispies). Instead of butterfingers, I used about 1/2 cup of Skor bits I had. I increased peanut butter to 1/2 cup of crunchy natural, unsweetened peanut butter. I used margarine instead of butter. I used coloured mini marshmallows instead of plain. I only used the melted 1 cup of chocolate chips, and didn\u2019t add the remaining 3/4 cup as chunks. I am happy with every change I made. The only thing I\u2019d like to try different is what it would taste like using the right kind cereal. I love that it\u2019s not as sweet as the original recipe might have made it. And I love the salty-sweet combo so much! I might even add chopped peanuts if I make it again. It was a great way to use up some items in my pantry that had been there too long.",
