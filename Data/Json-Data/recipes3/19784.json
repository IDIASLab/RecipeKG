Finally there is no need to thaw hashbrowns as you could break the frozen potatoes down with the hot soup mixture when mixing.",

I know it is a vegetarian recipe and is good as is as a side dish however for this to be an easy and complete meal we added a cup or so of cooked cubed ham. We also added a can of cream of chicken soup. The result was a creamy and tasty dinner. Good amount of everything and will make again. i must also add that it is really easy. Worth a try with meat or not. Thanks Linda!! My family appreciates it!!",

My boyfriend a meat and potatoes kind of guy loved it served with steamed broccoli.",
