Its a lot of work to shred a pound of cheese but the package stuff just does not compare. If you are going to serve it as a spread for crackers (as opposed to a sandwhich spread which to me is odd but lots of people like it that way) don't add all the juice from the pimentos. It will be too runny. Drain and save the juice and add as much as you want to make it a nice considtancy to serve as a cracker spread. To me a little bit of pepper and salt goes a long way...but thats a personal preference!",
