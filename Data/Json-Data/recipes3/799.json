You will use a little over half a bag of powdered sugar. More if mixture is still to wet when you try and remove it from the bowl. You will need to use powdered sugar to kneed the mixture like bread dough. When no longer tackey put powdered sugar on rolling pin and roll out. Follow recipe. Place wax paper between each layer of cookies(candy)to keep from sticking together in air tight containe. Hope this advice helps.:)",

They are great if you use enough sugar but VERY hard to roll (at least for me). My husband ended up re-rolling them after sticking them in the freezer for 30 minutes... that's why mine don't look like pinwheels (see photos)- but at least they ended up semi-round and edible and not in the trashcan which was where I was ready to throw them. I remember my dad's friend's wife making these when I was little and they were perfect pinwheels... if you do it correctly. So GOOD LUCK!:) My best recommendation is be patient and when in doubt stick it in the freezer for a little while to stiffen it up!:)",
