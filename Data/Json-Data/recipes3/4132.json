To make this recipe AMAZING double all the ingredients (other than the pasta) and add a chicken bullion cube. When adding the olive oil add a few tablespoons of tomato paste and let the sauce come to a boil before adding the pasta. I've even added a litte heavy cream to the sauce and it's great that way too.",

This time I added a pound of medium sized shrimp..next time I think I may try some chicken. I also love the fact that this can be eaten cold or hot! Now for the \"adjustments\" I didn't use a red onion only because I am not too fond of them so I used a yellow onion instead and the whole thing not just 1/2. I also used a whole red pepper instead of 1/2 and a few more mushrooms than that what was called for. A note for next time though....the recommened amount of veggies and pasta ratio seemed to be a little off..A 1 lb box of bow tie pasta makes a lot. I think next time I will add 2 zucchini and 2 squash instead of 1 each and a lot more mushrooms (we just love mushrooms) along with the whole onion and the whole red pepper..Maybe even a whole yellow pepper added to the mix would be nice. I also wonder how this would taste using a can or two of rotelle tomatoes (chopped tomatoes with green chilis) instead of the cut up roma tomatoes....Might give it a nice \"bite\"",

Used angel hair dried basil instead of fresh and cooked all the tomatoes rather than reserving any for the top.
