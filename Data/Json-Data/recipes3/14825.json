While the tots were baking, I sauteed the green pepper and green onion in butter, scrambled my eggs in a bowl then added to pan when the pepper and onion were getting soft. I placed baked tots in a bowl, covered with cooked scrambled eggs, drizzled a spoon full of hot salsa on top and then sprinkled with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I will definitely make it my way again but I appreciate the recipe idea.",
