She chopped up a large onion and put it in the pasta water allowing it to boil about 10 min. before adding the pasta to the pot, when the pasta was cooked she left about a 1/4 of the cooking water and the onions in the pot. The tomatoes were then added to the pasta with about 3/4 tsp. of baking soda then the milk, butter, salt & pepper were added and heated gentley.  This still remains one of my familys favorite comfort food.",

We don't think this is horrible or anything but we just couldn't get passed our prior expectations of what tomato soup should taste & feel like. I used the petite diced tomatoes and did add a small can of tomato sauce. I think it could use a little more spices but I can't off-hand think of which ones. Ofcourse I served with grilled cheese sandwiches but I'm not sure if I'd make this again. Thanks anyways!",

I had some sun-dried tomato pesto in the pantry and added about a teaspoon. I added a bit of half & half to make the soup a bit richer and creamy. I also added some dried basil onion powder a handful of fresh minced parsley a couple of shakes of dried chives and chili powder too. I loved the slight garlic taste the pesto gave the soup. I had my bowl of soup with some fresh buttermilk bread. The whole meal really hit the spot and was a real tummy-warmer. Thanks for the great and so easy recipe Norma!",
