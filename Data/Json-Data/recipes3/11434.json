Since I like mine seasoned more, I used 3 cups of dried black beans (instead of 4 cups) and used the remaining ingredients as stated above for 4 cups.  I used a hand blender to emulsify the beans instead of a food processor so I can control the consistency better.  In addition, I added about half a cup of the reserve water to slightly thin out the emulsified beans.",
