You have complete control over how you like them cooked - still crunchy or soft and tender, it's all in the bake. The flavor is a crowd-pleaser around our home. I've never seen these healthy vegetables disappear from my table more quickly than with this recipe! If you like your sprouts extra saucy, you may want to double the amount of glaze you make.",

After 20 minutes they had the perfect doneness and crispness but didn't have that perfect flavor. I recommend baking them for 10 minutes and then coating them in sweet chili and soy and then roasting them 10 minutes. At that time they should be done and have a good crisp to them. Roasting them for 20 and then broiling them was just too much in my opinion.",
