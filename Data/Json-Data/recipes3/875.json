Used canned white corn rinsed and canned green beans rinsed. Also didn't have fresh linguine used boxed and cooked aldente before folding it in. This is delicious but keep a little chicken stock or pasta water aside to add if your family is eating at different times of the night. It tends to dry out but no problem. This pasta will absorb all the great flavors....... Yummy",
