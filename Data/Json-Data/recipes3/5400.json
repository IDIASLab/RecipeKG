I also salted the whole dish after it was baked and added lemon on the fish which really made it delicious!",

I would instead add more garlicky salty seasons to the sweet potatoes. The salmon turned out beautifully & remember - TOAST the almonds. I did...and they tasted excellent with the dish. Toasted almonds have such a fuller flavor. I will make this again but probably not until the fall when the colors of this dish really accent the time of year.",

I followed the guidance of other readers and reduced the orange juice to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of water to that. I also reduced the orange marmalade to 1 Tblsp to the sauce and 1 on the salmon. I added a chopped clove of garlic and used powdered ginger instead of fresh as I was all out of fresh. I left the salmon steak in one piece so it took an extra five minutes to get it cooked all the way through. We served it with a fresh Belgian endive salad (w/ apples oranges walnuts and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing) which was a very good complement to the potatoes. Overall a very good recipe that we will enjoy again!",
