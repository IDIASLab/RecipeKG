It was suprisingly good and though I did not use the banana in the recipe; instead I rolled the cookies into sifted powdered sugar before placing them on the baking sheet and let them cool-they were so soft and tender. I made a home-made strawberry frosting and put that on the flat side of the cookie and made \"sandwich\" cookies out of them. What a treat!",
