The dough is coarse but that's how it is meant to be so it takes a little bit of practice to roll out the long strands and then shape them. The final cookies are pretty fragile as well but they melt in your mouths!!! the original German recipe (in metric but if you have a scale no problem) asks for 300 g flour 250 g butter 125 g sugar 150 g almond flour (ideally the white one Costco sells it) and the 3 egg yolks.",

The dough was rather tasteless so I added a touch of almond extract which made them better. Cookies broke when making crescent shape - on the last roll I just sliced them turned out ok. And wait at least 5 minutes to cool on the pan - any earlier and the cookie breaks. Won't make these again.",
