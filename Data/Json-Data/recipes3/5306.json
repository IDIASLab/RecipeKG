Make the dumplings with WET HANDS..rinse after each one! Wonderful fried in butter the next day. Someone said 'remove the salt pork'??? Sacrilege!! I've just set down to wait for my 'Freskies' to finish cooking. I thought I'd add a few notes to this review. For those of you who didn't have a mom or grandma to tell you a few secrets about cooking this wonderful dish: Do this next to the sink where you can have a slow stream of water to rinse your hands well. Your hands need to be really wet to avoid sticky messes. Work Quickly. After every 2 or so dumplings are added to the pot use a wide spatula to keep the dumplings from sticking to the pan. Soon they will float but 'til then keep using the spatula. Have a butter knife nearby when mixing the dough. You'll need it to scrape away the thick dough from your hands. I try to do as much as I can with one hand leaving the other free to add flour. REMOVE ALL RINGS AND BRACELETS (don't believe me-try it-you'll see why) Have an extra pan of water simmering on the stove to add hot water if necessary. I'm not so sure about the ratio of potatoes to flour in the recipe. This is a 'by feel' recipe. We don't use baking powder. Clean all surfaces and yourself WELL Nothing worse than dried paste stuck to hairs on your hand & arm. Practice to get the feel-not too sticky",

The Klubb was served with a sauce made with Geitost (brown goat cheese), hot salt pork bits and fat, and, for some, syrup! with boiled potatoes and rutabages on the side. Yum! it was delicious on a cold winter evening after skiing all day. the brunost sauce was basically a thin white sauce with plenty of shredded melted brown goat cheese (to taste). ",

I was raised on this stuff which is my favorite food in the world. Just a note: We eat it exactly the same was the first day but the second day is even better. I fill a frying pan with about a cup or so of milk. As the milk is warming on a medium burner cut the potato Klub into bite size pieces. I just slice with a knife over pan. Cook until the milk has formed a \"gravy\" consistancy stirring constantly. Serve on plates with dabs of butter. Yummy! I can't wait to make this again!!! Thank you for sharing this great receipe!!",

I then stuff with salt pork and drop into salted boiling water for 2.5 to 3.5 hours. this recipe/technique has been in my family for over 100 years and so far my klub has never fallen apart:).",
