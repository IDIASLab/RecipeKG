It's a shame a submitter can't list measurements of ingredients like butter or herbs \"to taste\" rather than precisely measured amounts. I measured nothing just mixing the pasta all up with the butter fresh basil parsley oregano and thyme as it suited me. I used a rainbow angel hair pasta. For those complaining this is dry first you must save some of your pasta cooking water and add it accordingly to moisten your pasta! Second a little extra butter never hurts.",
