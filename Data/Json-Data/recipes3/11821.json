The simplicity of saut\u00e9ed veggies and pasta tossed together are the epitome of Italian food. No extra seasonings or heavy creams here just taste the fresh crisp veggies and pasta. The fact that the pasta is gluten free is simply a footnote a little scribble in the margin. This will please your GF group as well as your wheat eaters.:-) Thank you or the recipe.",
