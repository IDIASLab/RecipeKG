I love the combination of caramel chocolate and pecans! I used semi sweet chocolate chips in place of the milk chocolate to cut the sweetness. I used a homemade pie crust with 1/4 cup Carmel spread over a baked crust and 1/4 cup chopped pecans. I than put in the filling. I frosted with whip topping and drizzled another 1/4 cup caramel sauce and sprinkled 1/4 cup chopped pecans. A small serving brings a satisfied smile!",

The filling is rich yet not heavy making it an ideal dessert for a big meal. I used Hershey bars for the chocolate but in future I think I'll try a different brand there is somethng about Hershey's milk chocolate that has an almost sour-milk flavor when melted that I don't taste with Lindt or Ghirardelli.",
