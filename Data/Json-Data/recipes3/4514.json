Based on some of the reviews I did the following: after scooping insides I salted the tomato boat and turned upside down (salt draws the liquid out and helps give flavor at the same time!). I mixed the corn with tomato insides eliminated the butter and added salt pepper chili powder and cayenne pepper. The spices worked SO great with the dish - and helped tie it in with enchiladas. When spooning into the tomato boats I kept mashing it down and draining allowing the excess liquid to come out. If you let the mixture sit for a little while with the salt added it will help draw out the liquid. These were flavorful healthy and really colorful! I will definitely make again.",

I added oregano for extra flavor but it still didn't have the 'wow' factor I was hoping for. When hallowing out the tomatoes leave the sides rather think. Thinning them out too much will make a mushy mess. Also I don't have a muffin pan so placing it on a baking tray worked fine as long as you pack the corn mixture into the hallowed tomato - this gives it weight and prevents it from toppling over.",
