We serve them along side and they were pretty and delicious",

I omitted the almonds alltogether because I personally do not enjoy nuts in my food. For the spices send herbs I added fresh basil smoked paprika and a dash of cinnamon. In the filling I also added a squeeze of lemon juice and smoked cheddar cheese in addition to the ricotta and parmesean. The recipe turned out great! Creamy cheesy smoky and herby!",
