Will have to try with sharp cheese just to see how it turns out. Enjoy!",

I don't even think you'll get credit for making it yourself since I'd take the box over this. I told my husband what this was called (Restaurant Style Mac & Cheese) and he said \"Whose restaurant?\" lol If you're looking for restaurant style you may want to consider something else. If you're in college and love your velveeta this is it except a load more of excess cheese. I love cheese... heck it could be my middle name but even with 2C of macaroni... it was too much. Sorry!",
