The scallops I had to work with weren't the highest quality but that isn't her fault. The dish lacked that punch of flavor I thought it would have. I felt if I hadn't followed the recipe to a T but had thrown in some more wine garlic. That some more something my taste buds were waiting for it would have been really good. It is a great starting point though.",
