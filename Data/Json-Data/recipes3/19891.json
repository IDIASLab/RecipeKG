I am glad I did.  It was so good. I have no idea why another reviewer said it wasn't good. Mine came out perfect. I followed the recipe for the dough exactly the way it is printed. It does liquify at first but by the end of adding all the sugar it is a nice dough. One suggestions would be to microwave or bake the potato instead of boiling them.  It keeps the potato drier so you don't have to add extra sugar. Also I started with 8 oz of chocolate and figured if I need more I could add it as I went, but that was enough for me.  I rolled them into balls and dunked the bottom half in chocolate. It was easier and less messy that way. Then I rolled them in crushed peanuts, mini chips, coconut, and crushed pepperment.  Then I set them white side down on wax paper. The toppings you can use is endless. We liked the peanuts the best. Also instead of using vanilla you could add any flavor of extract you like or some rum or brandy.  I will be making this again.",

My mother-in-law is getting up in years and decided that this Christmas she wouldn't be making her candy. I questioned her about how to make it and then checked with \"all recipes.com\" to compare. Its the same ingredients and is just as good if not better than what we've had for years. I've made this twice this Christmas. The second time I used my mixer to blend in the powdered sugar. It saved time & energy. After it was mixed I put in the frig for 2 hours. Next I used my small cookie scoop for even amounts and rolled into balls. I put these back into the frig so they would firm up. This made dipping much easier. I used 1 1/2 lb. of dipping chocolate 22 oz. Spanish peanuts (chopped fine in my food processor). Makes approximately 5 1/2 dozen. Note: Don't salt the water when boiling the potatoes or your candy will be too salty.",

I did find you had to add more sugar than the recipe called for..You just keep slowly adding sugar in small increments until the dough gets so stiff you're not able to easily stir it then cover and chill..Then I dusted my surface and dough with powdered sugar rolled it out & divided the dough into four sections to make it easier to work with..Then section by section I spread peanut butter on the dough rolled it up and made the roll very thin(much like you did with playdough when you were little making skinny 'wiggly' worms..lol)..Cut into small pieces and..yum!..enjoy...Overall a great recipe but makes ALOT of candy..I'm going to half it next time..",

This one is just the same...DELICIOUS!!! Every time I make this I am suddenly thinking I've done something wrong when first adding the powdered sugar it truly liquifies but turns into a very special treat. Thanks again for this one.
