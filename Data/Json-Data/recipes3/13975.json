The texture and taste of the cauliflower mash makes this creamy, filling, and comforting -- and there's still plenty of cheese to get your fix! It's a great source of veggies, a perfect meatless Monday option, and freezes well (if you have any leftovers...which has only happened once). This is actually requested over full cheese versions among my friends now!",
