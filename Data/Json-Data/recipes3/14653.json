Suffice to say, it was fabulous!  I did not have any blackberry jam, but I did have a bottle of Manischewitz Blackberry Wine.  I used that in place of the red wine and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  Did not add salt, but seasoned with ground white pepper.  This was good over the venison, but I can envision this sauce over a bacon wrapped filet Mignon and topped with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.  Will be making this one again.",
