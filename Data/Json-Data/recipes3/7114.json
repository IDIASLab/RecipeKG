For new bakers a make-shift double boiler is easily concocted by placing a just smaller pot or bowl inside a little larger pot of water. I think an Oreo crust might be even better. Oh and I just used regular Cool Whip twice instead of chocolate no problem. Don't be intimidated by all of the ingredients it's not hard...okay maybe a little time consuming but worth it.

I also used the chocolate pudding mixed into my whipped topping. My family likes the dark chocolate layer so we made a pie with just that layer and it was wonderful. I would definitely recommend you use a deep dish pie crust if you make all three layers! The one layer pie fit perfectly into a regular pie crust. Also substitute a chocolate cookie crumb crust and it's much better. I used chocolate animal crackers butter and sugar for mine.",

Here is what I did: I melted 5 squares of Baker's chocolate (2 dark; 3 semi-sweet) with 2 cups of mini-marshmallows and 1/3 c. of half/half cream in the microwave. I put this in the microwave for one-minute on high. I whisked the mixture until all of the marshmallows were dissolved. I then refrigerated the mix for 30 minutes. Added 2 cups of Cool Whip to the mixture. I also added a little bit of chocolate mousse mix from Dr. Oetker (about 1/3 of a package)to help things stiffen up a bit. Poured into prepared pie crust topped with remaining Cool Whip. My sister the choc. pie connaisseur thought that this had a really dense chocolate flavour and would have liked a bit lighter or creamier filling. However I thought the flavours were spot on and the texture of the filling was almost perfect--next time I'll cut out the Dr. Oetker (or cut it down to 2 tbsp).",
