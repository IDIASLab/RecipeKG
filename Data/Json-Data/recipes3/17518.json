If you've changed things, it's no longer that recipe.\n\nI'm trying to eat healthier and my nutrition coach suggested trying sweet potatoes instead of rolls/bread for my carbs. I'm hooked now!! I personally don't care for sweet potatoes and wasn't looking for a recipe that calls for adding molasses or brown sugar or anything like that to it. I don't personally like this by itself, but I eat it with meat (chicken and steak) and enjoy eating a bite of it with the meat. It's actually addictive eating it that way in my opinion. It's still sweet because it's a sweet potato. But I really like the spices that are included with it, especially the garlic!",

At first I thought the recipe was too heavy on the garlic and I think I would use a tad less if I made this again but my family ended up really liking it! Even my brother who doesn't like mashed sweet potatoes had two helpings and says it was really good. Overall 4/5 stars for this recipe! The spices really help jazz up these mashed potatoes and complement each other well.",

If you have to add sugar to your vegetable to make them taste good there is something wrong with the vegetable. I would definitely allow them to drain completely before mashing them.
