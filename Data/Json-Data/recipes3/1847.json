                "reviewBody": "This is close to my own recipe but I've always used all butter. I was never quite happy with the results because the frosting was always a bit too sweet for me. Following Rick's recipe, but using half salted butter & half regular Crisco, 6 cups of confectioners sugar, about 4 to 5 ounces of heavy whipping cream and 2 teaspoons of pure Vanilla, I found the PERFECT BLEND. Great spreading consistency and just sweet enough. The Crisco seems to cut the sweetness, while giving the frosting a bit more stability, which is great if you're going to use it for piping borders around a cake or making rosettes and leaves on top. Be sure to beat the frosting with an electric mixer on high speed, a minimum of 10 minutes, or until nice and fluffy. Had enough to GENEROUSLY frost 24 cupcakes, with about 2 cups left over. Can\u2018t believe using Crisco would make all the difference. Thanks Rick!  *UPDATE 1: The whipping cream is a MUST! I forgot to buy whipping cream and used milk instead, big mistake... the frosting wasn't as fluffy and creamy. *UPDATE 2: I wanted a peanut butter frosting for a Reese's chocolate cake I was making, so I added in 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter with the Crisco and butter. Turned out great, with just enough of a peanut butter taste to do the trick.",

I also used real vanilla powder (less color than extract). With 6oz heavy cream instead of the milk it becomes a terrificly rich light and fluffy frosting that spreads beautifully. You could beat in slightly more sugar to part of the finished frosting if you want to use it to pipe roses (but don't use that much sugar to cover the whole cake).",
