I covered it for a few minutes to wilt down the spinache, added a little crushed red pepper, gave it a toss, and it was to die for!

I used some blackening seasoning on the scallops with some garlic pepper and pan seared mine in a bit of olive oil and butter. This will be made again in my home w/o question.",
