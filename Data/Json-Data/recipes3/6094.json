I used a bit of kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper to season. I love the fresh basil on these. Definitely serve hot off the stove as these cool down quickly. You could add a little shaved Parmesan or feta cheese to this to take it over the top - great with grilled steak or grilled chicken.",

I added Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper while the tomatoes were sauteeing shaking the pan frequently. In mere minutes they were done. I really like how the sweet juices of the tomatoes bursts in my mouth along with the sauteed garlic and fresh basil. Oooh what a wonderful blend of fresh flavors! The sprinkles of fresh basil over the tomatoes stand out-very pretty. This is a terrific side dish and a good way to use up grape tomatoes. One that I will keep in mind for use again in the future. I served this along with \"Portuguese Pork with Red Peppers \" \"Lemon-Sesame Asparagus \" and \"Parsley Red Potatoes \" all from this website.",
