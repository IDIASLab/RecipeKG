The recipe didn't say what type vinegar to use so I used white balsamic and added some fresh dill which always partners well with green beans. I steamed the green beans for 2 mins and 20 seconds in the micro on high which left them perfectly crisp. This was a welcome change for a nice side salad with dinner. This didn't knock-my-socks-off but I did enjoy it.",

Then let the concoction marinate for a bit (like overnight - but not necessarily that long - depends on your taste and/or how strong the radishes are). Lutzflact's choice to add dill made a lot of sense to me as does adding some black olives: those ingredients were in another radish recipe I have learned to love (with added sweetener): matchstick celery radish slices minced onion dill S&P and... that bit of sugar.

Just as others have said in their reviews this was lacking the flavoring of the vinegar when made as stated. I then tried adding an extra tablespoon of vinegar but still found it a little on the bland side. I then began by just sprinkling small amounts of vinegar on, tossing, then tasting until I had the right flavouring. I didn't want to put a full tablespoon on each time as I feared that would end up being too much. Ultimately I ended up loving this salad but I wasn't going to rate it that way. The rating is to be for the recipe as written, not for how it gets fixed up, and I wish people would rate things accordingly and stop rating how well their food tastes once they get done playing with the recipe!",
