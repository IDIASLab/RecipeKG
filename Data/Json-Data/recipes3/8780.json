The sauce was so tasty I made mashed potatoes so I could have more of it. There was enough sauce for three breasts and potatoes too! A keeper!",

Having never cooked with them before I immediately opened up my All Recipes app to see what I could find and this recipe was first on the list. I followed to recipe exactly except I used cubed chicken versus chicken breasts. I was concerned the chicken would get too dry but simmering it in with the mushrooms and chicken broth prevented that. The flavor was excellent! Not bland as other reviews had mentioned. I served it with fettuccine noodles and sauteed squash and zucchini it was so delicious! My husband loved it and I will most definitely be making this again.",
