Cooked in an hour but I had to put foil over the top to not burn the onions half way through the cook time.  I will definitely make again with the above changes.",

Some adjustments I made:\n- I replaced the summer squash with butternut, which I peeled and cut into very thin slices.\n- I sprinkled some paprika and turmeric between each layer of veggies. Tastes great with curry powder too, or whatever other spices you like.\n- I added some cloves of garlic, cut into \u00bc inch slices, under the top layer of veggies\n- If you want the dish to cook in about 25 minutes, slice the potatoes and veggies really thin (less than \u00bc inch thick), pour about \u00bd cup of broth into the pan, and cover the pan loosely with foil before putting it into the oven.\n- I found the butter really didn't add much to the recipe, so if you want it to be vegan (or just a lower fat option), cut out the butter and pour a bit of veggie broth over the veggies before baking.\n- I sprinkled a mix of breadcrumbs and spices on top right before putting the dish into the oven. This gave the dish a really nice texture and taste. Make your breadcrumb mix with any spices you like! I used salt, pepper, turmeric and paprika.",
