I made it as directed and it turned out the way it should have but the taste just wasn't for me... first time ever having tarragon for me and I think that was the issue. Just a little too bitter. I may replace it with Italian seasoning and minced garlic instead of the mustard in the future. It has a lot of potential just not necessarily my style. I do have to admit though that I had fun cooking it!",

I would suggest putting a very thin smear of mustard on the fish in addition to salt and pepper. And add mustard to the meringue. I used panko and it gave a nice texture. I think you need to use a fish that gives a flavor contrast to the egg which is more of an edible garnish. This does serve to keep the salmon moist as it finishes cooking so it's important to watch your timing on the first round of cooking. Beautiful presentation if done correctly. Next time I will try cooking on alder plank.",
