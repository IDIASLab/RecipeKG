I varied the recipe by using 2 tablespoons of Mexican Rum and Expresso Coffee Powder instead of Strong Coffee. Jackpot!!! This recipe has potential in that a lot of variations of the theme is possible. I could try Whiskey Maraschino Amaretto... The reason that I did not give it a high Kid Friendly rating is because Coffee is an ADULT taste. Kids do not like coffee that much. Of course I also discounted this on my overall rating....on the other hand my son liked it. This is great on Chocolate Cake and a good recipe to experiment with!",

I made a second batch and lightly melted the butter, and added about a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder.  Perfect!  The color was also much better, and the texture was creamy, fluffy, and wonderful!  It's a good base to work from, which I appreciate! :)  ",
