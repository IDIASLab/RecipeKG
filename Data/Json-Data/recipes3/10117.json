After it was done, I added cayenne pepper and black pepper to our taste.  This recipe is easily doubled or tripled.  I made it the first time to see if we would like it  and then immediately made a triple batch to freeze.  When you read the recipe, it doesn't sound like anything special but it is wonderful.",
