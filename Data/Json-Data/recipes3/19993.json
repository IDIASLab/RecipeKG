This got absolutely RAVE reviews from my boyfriend, to whom every mean is usually the same: \"good.\"  I did make a couple adjustments, though: shook the chicken up in a ziploc bag with the oil (added a little more), vinegar (and used some balsamic as well), garlic, and some seasoning salt (Alpine Touch), then put in the greased dish with more vinegar, oil, and garlic sprinkled over. Dusted with cajun and black pepper and cooked, then added a bit of chicken broth and red pepper flakes with the mushrooms/green onions.  A tip: to reduce shriveling and browning of mushrooms, put the green onions over top the mushrooms.  This recipe is really versatile;  it was fine in the oven an extra ten minutes (with the oven shut off) while i finished up the rest of the meal.  Served with Asiago Sun-dried Tomato Pasta (see review) with farfelle pasta tossed with parsley, olive oil, parmasan, and red and black pepper.  I'll DEFINATELY make this again!",

I used a plastic bag and put the oil vinegar garlic and some seasoning salt in then tossed the chicken in and gave it all a good smooshing around put it in a greased dish topped it with some Creole seasoning (all I had) and then pepper then tossed on some red pepper flakes for good measure. Chucked it in the oven as the recipe says after 30 minutes I took it out and topped it with some baby bellas and the chopped green onions and cooked it 15 minutes more. When it came out I topped it with the sliced swiss and let it sit whilst I whipped up some rice-a-roni angel hair pasta as a side toasted up some BBQ bread (hubby HAS to have bread) and then it was ready to eat! We all agreed it was quite tasty fairly simple and made for a marvelous presentation. It DID look like something from a restaurant. Hubby even stated I should add it to my keeper file. That's high praise around here.",

He doesn't like just any kind of food but with this one they all really liked a lot. I tried some too and it was yummy. The only thing that I did differently was that I put the oil vinegar and seasonings in a bag like some of the other reviews mentioned then i added the chicken to the bag and I left it like that in the fridge for about 4 hours to marinate. It really was awesome. Will definately make again. Can't wait to make it for my husband he'll love it. Thanks a million.",
