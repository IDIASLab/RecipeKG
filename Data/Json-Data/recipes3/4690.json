I increased the amount of bacon to 6 strips instead of 4 because bacon makes anything better.  I added a little olive oil and season all to the cabbage and onion while they were sauteing.  Everything else was done per the recipe. I think they have an aprodisiac kind of effect to them because my wife couldn't keep her hands off of me after I made these.  I made them with another recipe found here for meat loaf and it was just scrupious.  Hope you all enjoy my review and remember, don't let your meat loaf.",

I omitted the bacon and subbed olive oil and butter to saute the cabbage mix and added 2 lg cloves of garlic to compensate for the flavor.  I boiled the potato in veggie broth for the same reason.  I also increased the relative proportions of cabbage and onion to potato.  Lastly, I added about a 1/4 c. or so of aged white cheddar with a little extra as garnish with more dill too.   Next time I will try carrots, turnips or rutabagas with the potato for a change of pace, or perhaps try some Guiness Stout instead of the milk for a vegan dish.",

I used some baby yellow potatoes since that was what I had on hand & a bag of shredded cabbage for coleslaw.
