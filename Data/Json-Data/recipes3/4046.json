It's a yummy recipe and great to serve as finger food. I like to use both beef and pork but you can substitute one for the other. VERY EASY!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is great, but there is no need for the additional salt because the soy sauce has a lot of sodium.  Also, if you like garlic, use fresh crushed garlic instead. I tend to use ground beef instead of ground pork because the ground pork takes longer to cook, and when I make a huge batch of these, I don't have time to make sure the pork is cooked well and at the same time the lumpia wrapper is not burnt!  My extra ingredient that gives the taste a special twist is to use sesame oil too.  I use sesame oil that's more an asian style, and it has a strong scent, but a lot of people will say it tastes good and ask what that extra ingredient is.  I also add an egg as well.   This recipe is good w/sweet and sour sauce or w/soy sauce and a little vinegar for dipping.Another good sauce to eat with this is Thai sweet chili sauce for a little hint of spice.  OH YEAH ..they're great for freezing in case you have unexpected guests... like the other reviewer said, you don't need to thaw before frying, just be careful of oil spatter.. don't turn the heat too high or it will burn quickly while the middle is still frozen.  If you want to  make  sure the amount of soy sauce isn't too salty for you, don't add it all at once, and you could do what my mom does, throw a little tiny bit of the meat on a pan and fry it and then taste it to get your flavors right.  a tip i got from my cousin is that if you are freezing them, spray the bag or container you keep them in with baking spray  and lay",

The extra salt is not needed at all. I cooked some when fresh and froze the rest. They work great when fried after being frozen. Just put in hot oil without thawing. Next time I may try adding some veggies to the mix for some variety. These are a lot of work but so worth the time and effort.",

                "reviewBody": "I have been making lumpia for years now  using all pork, all ground beef and even all ground turkey for the filling.  The pork filled lumpia came in first for taste with the ground turkey coming in second. Check the lumpia wrappers for mold before you check out in the grocery store. Experience has taught me that the lumpia wrappers either need to be used almost immediately or frozen for future use as soon as you get them home.  They mold easily and I have bought my fair share of unchecked moldy wrappers home. It is really important to only put about a pinkie's worth of filling in each wrapper as these cook up pretty quickly and you want to make sure these are done completely. Sometimes I cheat using store bought shredded carrot and cabbage cole slaw mixture and a half a medium onion for the vegetables. Oh and dont forget to pull all of the wrappers apart before you start rolling (a huge time saver).  Just remember to cover them back up with a dry dishcloth as to prevent drying out while rolling. I always create an assembly line using about 7 wrappers at a time  quickly stuffing, rolling then sealing them. Sweet Chilli Sauce is a must have for dipping.  It can usually be found next to the sweet and sour sauce of any grocery store while the wrappers can be found in the frozen section.  Both can be found at just about any international grocery store. Cook some lumpia now and freeze the rest for a later date.  ",

These are excellent!!! I will DEFINITELY make these again (probably weekly)!!! I also used egg roll wrappers instead of spring roll wrappers (didn't have them on hand at the time). I have also found that I can brush them with peanut oil and bake them in a 425 degree oven for 25 min to reduce the fat content turning the lumpia after 10 minutes. The peanut oil also adds a nice flavor when deep fried. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!",
