I was a little unsure of how they would be recieved because it did not look like traditional bruschetta but they are SO much tastier and there were no leftovers. I added some diced mozzarella to the tomato mixture for that complimentary taste. I will definately make these again...One problem though- the recipe made way too much pesto and i did not even use the requested amount of almonds. Thanks for the recipe Maryanne.",

I started using my blender but it couldn't do the job so I had to get out the food processor. It makes too much pesto but it tastes great! I ended up only using about half the pesto so I need to find something else to use it for. Next I used two medium tomatoes and it just wasn't enough. Between the caprese salad and this I was out of tomatoes. I would increase your tomato amount if you like it more tomatoee on top. If you are using good tomatoes omit the olive oil in the mixture. I was using wonderful tomatoes and thought the oil took away from the fresh flavor. Make it easier on yourself and make less pesto and more tomato mixture without the oil. Excellent!",
