I didn't have fresh oregano so I used dried. I let this marinate for 8 hours and skewered this with red and green peppers cherry tomatoes and red onion.",

I'm so tired of chicken marinades that don't really permeate the meat but not here. The lime garlic and pepper were very present. Sadly the pepper flakes only ended up on half of my piece. Next time I'll use cayenne or hot sauce to make sure I get an even coating of spice. I served it with rice pilaf and grilled pineapple spears and was told to \"Make this again!\" We loved it! Update Made this for Mom and she only let put in a dash or two of hot sauce afraid of too much heat. It was much worse for the change tasting like lime chicken with not much else going on. Do not omit or reduce the pepper flake or sauce it's really needed to make this dish shine.",
