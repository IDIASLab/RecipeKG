With these changes i assure you, you cant go wrong. the directions are a little vague so here is my way. i mixed 2 1/2 cups of flour with 1/2tsp salt and set aside. then i mixed 1cup of butter with 1 egg white and 1 1/2tsp vanilla. Then i added 1/3cup of powder sugar(aka confectioner's sugar) then i added the flour mixture and 1/2-1cup of finely chopped walnuts. i rolled them into small balls, a little smaller than a golfball and baked them at 400F (205c) for 8-10min then i rolled them in more powder sugar (confectioner's sugar) to coat. these are great cookies with a slight crumble. full of flavor if you fallow the changes i made.
