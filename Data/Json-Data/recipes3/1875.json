I love it all, but was glad I reduced the amounts of all three by nearly half. I loved the subtle flavors they contributed, but can't imagine using the full measurements called for! Not sure of what pureeing the celery was, but I did, but I also added some sliced celery as well for texture and crunch. I served this over Romaine lettuce leaves with hard boiled eggs and sliced tomatoes on the side and it made for a light, but satisfying lunch.",

I have a fear of overcooking chicken white meat, so I let the residual heat finish the cooking, and the meat was nice and moist.  I boned and skined the meat and cut it up small.  I chopped 2 of the celery stalks very finely and added them to the chicken, and pureed only one of the chopped stalks.  I also added chopped red onion to the puree as suggested by other reviewers, and used reduced fat mayonnaise and grated fresh Parmesana Reggiano.  I served the salad on sandwich sized croisants with sliced tomatoes, and this was nummy!  Much better than the run of the mill chicken salads with nuts and fruit.  I will definitely make this again and again.!",

I love chicken salad and I had one leftover herb grilled chicken breast and some fresh basil in the fridge and didn't know what to make for lunch. What a pleasant surprise this little recipe turned out to be! I cut the amount of basil in half as well as the amount of celery. I put everything into the food processor along with a bit of onion powder. I used light mayo and light parmesan cheese to lighten it up and let this chill for an hour before serving. This chicken salad was creamy and delicious. It was perfect in a wrapped in a tortilla with romaine lettuce and tomato! Thanks for a really great recipe. I will definitely make this again!",

However I used the full amount anyway and once I pureed it with the other ingredients it came out a great consistency. The grated Parmesan really helps to soak up the excess moisture. I chopped the chicken up pretty finely and the end result was almost a paste-like consistency (but in a good way)--closer to the consistency of tuna salad than the usual chunky chicken salad. I liked it. My only criticism is that I really can't taste the chicken at all. It's overwhelmingly Basil/Parmesan/Garlic. It wasn't because I had bland chicken. I used the breast of a rotisserie chicken and the chicken was extremely flavorful. It would have been nice for some of that flavor to come out in the salad but it was totally overpowered by the other ingredients. I think next time I'll try halving the amount of Parmesan and garlic. I didn't even use the full amount of basil this time... just however much was in the little package I got from the store. I may use less basil next time too. I think the ingredients would complement the chicken quite well in less abundant quantities.",
