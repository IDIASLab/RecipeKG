I would have given this recipe a much higher rating, but due to the raw vegetables, I only am giving it three stars.",

I used a dribble of buttermilk rather than the 1/2 cup milk only because I had some to use. I sauteed the onions before I added them because they would only get heated for 15 minutes and I wanted them cooked. One jalapeno rather than two was friendlier to Hubs' sensitive innards. I used more butter and sour cream than called for and added some of the Cheddar and bacon (I used the real thing) to the potatoes rather than just sprinkling it over the top. The results were a real taste sensation odd since there is no seasoning! The peppers and bacon not only make these potatoes colorful and festive they add a zippiness of flavor. The recipe is very worthy of being repeated but I will keep in mind that 2 c. of shredded cheese was way more than I needed even after adding a good amount to the potato mixture.",

I submitted as is due to the fact that I like raw vegetables but since this posting (2006) have found that it would be best to cook the onion and peppers first. Wonderful suggestion! My intention for the sour cream is to top the potato and is optional but it does taste great to add it into the potato mixture as well. I submitted the edits about 2 years ago it takes a while for it to be processed. Also use real bacon not fake bacon pieces if you can. Thank for all of the nice reviews. I'm glad you all have enjoyed is as much as I do.",

Otherwise I liked these. I used a little more sour cream than was recommended and a little less milk -- because we prefer the flavor of sour cream. The texture was not compromised. This is easily customizable to your personal tastes. I suggest using kosher salt and oil on the outside of the potatoes during the baking stage so that the skins are flavored too so you can slice and eat the ENTIRE thing! Thanks for the recipe. P.S. I subtracted a star because the recipe doesn't tell you when to use the onion and sour cream. It's apparently been like that for at least 3 years now and no one has bothered to edit it:(",
