I made this for a recent dinner party/barbecue and got rave reviews. I rarely follow recipes to the \"T\" when it comes to proportions (other than baking) but I know I used a full pound of bacon. It was not too much because so much volume was lost in the cooking. I used more potatoes than called for. Although I didn't measure it out I'm sure I did not use 2 cups of balsamic. I added it about 2 Tbs. at a time and then tasted until it seemed right. I liked the fact that this recipe is not loaded with oil or mayo. As I said everyone loved the potato salad and this will be added to my regular repertoire.",

I drained off most of it for health reasons reserving just a little for flavor.
