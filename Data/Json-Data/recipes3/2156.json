I made a couple minor changes... i didn't have any cilantro (well ok i admit it i did but... it had spent too much time mashed in the back of my crisper L ). So i used a big handful of baby spinach. Nice mild flavour and great color combination with the red pepper. I also had to used lemon zest/juice and i tossed in a small minced garlic clove for extra zing. Some reviewers have commented on sourness... not a problem in my case.. i found the dish quite sweet actually (probably depends a lot on the zippiness of the oranges used and maybe lime juice would have been tarter than the lemon i used?). I was thinking a few pitted/chopped kalamata olives might have made a nice garnish.... i'll try that next time and yes there will be a next time. Thanks for the great recipe... it's a keeper!",

My friend is not a fan of cilantro at all so I left it out- although I believe it would have made a nice addition. I made this recipe with 4 large scallops for 2 servings. I served it sans the pasta and it was perfect as an appetizer for us. The scallops I cooked separately than adding it to the peppers and green onions cause I wanted that nice crust on the top of the scallop. It was a good balance between the sweetness of the orange the tart of the lime and the hint of spice with the incorporation of the red pepper flakes. The red peppers sucked up the citrus from the orange and the lime. It added a slight crunch to the dish and complemented the scallops very well. The scallops were like butter! I will definitely make this again!",
