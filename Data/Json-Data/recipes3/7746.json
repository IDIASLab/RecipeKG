I made it and took it to a church salad potluck this weekend and got rave reviews. I made the salad the day before and added the dressing the morning of the potluck as I was worried the rice would get mushy if I added it too soon. There are two things I did differently. One was to add a large can of mandarin oranges which was not a good idea. My husband liked it with but I think that was the one thing that did make it a little too juicy and I would not add again. Sorry honey! The second was I did add another half cup of cranberries (I just really like them and it added some extra sweetness) and I added in some extra cashews for more crunchiness. The salad was awesome! I will be making this all summer as a side dish for grilled chicken or pork. Yum!",
