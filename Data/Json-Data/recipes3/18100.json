        "description": "The inspiration of this recipe came straight from the video game Fallout: New Vegas. I have, however, made a few changes to enhance its overall quality. This is a hearty, spicy, and very tasty stew that has gotten me through some rough times; the ingredients are all relatively cheap, healthy, and filling--ideal for the starving student type-- not that I'd expect anyone else to enjoy it any less. Serve, optionally, with a dollop of sour cream. This will keep in the fridge for 10 to 14 days, and reheats quite well.",
