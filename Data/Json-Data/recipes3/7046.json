Cooked it for an hour or so then it was even better the next day. Didn't need any salt or pepper. The tomato juice and chicken stock are salty. Wonderful soup more like a stew!",

I did change up the sauteing method since throwing veggies in a pot over high heat with no oil would turn into a burnt mess.  I used about 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat to saute, then added in the rest of the ingredients, except for the turkey. I added that in during the last 3-4 minutes as it doesn't need to cook, but rather just heat through.  Instead of chicken broth I used the turkey broth I had made from my leftover carcass. I also used green salsa.   There is nothing spicy about this soup, especially since the recipe calls for 1 drop of hot sauce. You will definitely need to add much more if you like things spicy.  I think I would have liked this a little more with tomato juice instead of V8, but overall it was a nice change from the usual turkey soup!",
