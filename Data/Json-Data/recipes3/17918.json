First, I cooked about 6 slices of bacon in a cast iron skillet. I saved a bit of the grease to saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic. I omitted the bell peppers (6 grams of carbs). I added chorizo because I had it on hand and it sounded good. I saut\u00e9ed all of this with the cauliflower and a bit of the broth to get the goodies at the bottom of the pan. I followed directions as written on the rest in the instant pot, except I did half heavy cream and have 1/2 and 1/2 to cut carbs again. I also did half store bought shredded cheddar and half fancier English cheddar block. \nAll my family loved it and they are not doing keto diet (They topped theirs with lo mein noodles).  I have enough left over for three lunches this week as well, and I\u2019m looking forward to it.",

Anyhow I followed recipe except did it on my stove top which means it took more time & before adding the cheese and half & half I did have to blend it in my ninja blender to make it a soup consistency. So if someone else doesn't have an insta pot you can do it on the stove with a regular pot but you will most likely need to blend it to make it soup consistency. \n\nWe will keep this recipe & make again even when not on the Keto diet.",

Tasted great. I wouldn't make this by itself as directed for the family since only two of us like cauliflower but with the addition of the broccoli it became something all of us could enjoy. Only big change I would make is to double the turkey bacon. Regular bacon may have enough flavor but turkey bacon is a little blander.",
