If it is too oily, you have added TOO MUCH SESAME/CANOLA OIL.  If it is not spicy enough for you, the ingredients listed are NOT spicy.  You need to add red pepper flakes, curry or other spice of your choice to GET IT THAT WAY.  Not enough flavor for you?  Rummage through your spices and have at it!  A nice twist to the hoisin sauce is to use black bean and garlic paste.  Throw in a little fish sauce.  Play with the veggies.  Have FUN with this recipe!",

This is only a suggestion but we thought use less ginger (1/2 tbsp would be good) less pasta (probably 4-6 oz) more soy sauce (about 1 tbsp more) more hoisin sauce (about 1 tbsp more) more chicken (I used a 9oz time trimmers box so I would double that) and add about 1 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms. I'm going to try that variation next shopping trip. Otherwise thanks so much for sharing this recipe it's totally awesome! and once you get all the ingredients together...totally easy to cook!",

The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think it needs more vegetables.It is a great base recipe and if you like more flavor- just add it! I personally like more of a sesame flavor so I added more sesame seeds. More Bok choy is absolutely necessary! Thank you for the recipe! My husband and I really enjoyed it.",

I agree with others that it's low on veggies so we always add more bok choy sometimes snap peas but usually just enjoy its simplicity as is. Suggestion: slice the chicken into thin bite-size strips instead of cubing it (helps if meat is slightly frozen). It allows the meat to soak up the sauce better and over a greater surface area.",
