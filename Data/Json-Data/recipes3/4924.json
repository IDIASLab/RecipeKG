While there we visited her friend in Liguria and was served this dish as it is very popular in that region. I loved it and make it often in the summer when I have so much fresh basil from the garden. I make it the way it was prepared in Italy. I boil the pasta add the potatoes to the pasta during the last six minutes of boiling and then add the green beans to the water during the last three minutes. Everything is drained and the pesto added and tossed. I didn't use the yogurt but that might be an interesting addition.",

I added walnuts and sauteed them in butter along with the potatoes and green beans as directed. Used just a bit of sugar with the yogurt to balance the tang.

I've been irritated more than once when there is a long string of people who have rated a recipe really high and then someone gives it a one star - I just don't see how that can happen. You should have a sense of what you're getting when you try a recipe and if it has things about it which you know you don't care for (eg it's spicy and you like bland)- then don't bother cause you're going in with a negative attitude. Well this is a long way of saying I reallllly did not care for this recipe - and I don't know why. It is adventuresome - interesting mix of ingredients all of which I like individually. Partly I think it was the potatoes - their texture was weird with all the other ingredients. I used frozen green beans and I added some chunks of white chicken meat - other than that followed exactly as written. This just did not work for me.",
