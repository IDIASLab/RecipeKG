Here's what I did: Crisped the bacon in a pan and removed. Dumped all but a Tbs of grease and fried mushrooms in pan for a minute. Added 1/4 cup of chicken stock and scraped up the bacon bits. Added broccoli and garlic and covered to steam veggies. Added very al dente pasta to pan and 1/2 cup more chicken stock. Reduced by half and finished w/ a dash of cream and some parmesan. Then I sprinkled the bacon on top and served with more parmesan. Soooo good.",

I saw that Kez a good friend made it and enjoyed it and decided I had to try it. I cooked the bacon first then took it out and added onion in with the 'shrooms and I used some roasted garlic I had on hand. After they began to get tender I added a bit of flour before I put the chicken broth in. I added the bacon back into it with the pasta and mixed in some Parmesan cheese. My hubby said next time add some asparagus I think that will be great! Thanks Onyx78 for sharing!",

The reduction of the \"sauce\" (which wasn't a sauce so don't be expecting that!) was the only ridiculous part of this recipe. There is no way that would have ever reduced to a few Tbsp. without turning my pasta to baby food. Here are the changes that I will make next time...1)I'm using MORE bacon...this is the main flavor in this dish and we love bacon so the more the merrier! 2) Either add flour or cornstarch to thicken the sauce or reduce the liquid. 3) A green veggie would be nice. I'm thinking the others had it right...either broccoli or asparagus. 4) Drain the bacon grease...at least drain most of it. 5) Remove the bacon and mushrooms after sauteeing and add them right before serving. I think after making these changes we are definitely looking at a contender for a simple easy relatively inexpensive winner!",
