It already has the crushed tomatoes, onions, olive oil,..,I did still add a couple of drizzles of olive oil. My gnocchi had to cook a bit longer to rise to the top. Then I let it boil 3-4 minutes more. I doubled the Parmesan and mozzarella, only because my jar of sauce was quite large. I\u2019ve never put fresh mozzarella in a broiler. I didn\u2019t feel it melted that well. It mostly kept its shape. I would like to try this again with hand shredded whole milk mozzarella and maybe even adding sausage. Ty, for an easy week night recipe.",
