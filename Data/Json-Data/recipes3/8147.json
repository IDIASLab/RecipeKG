It is almost the same as Kevin's except he does not add the onion ( I am going to try it though) and he grills the sandwich after it is assembled (like a grilled cheese). There is just something about the combination of flavors that is just amazing. The fried egg with the mix of condiments and the pickle OMG Yum!!! If anyone has access to Finnish mustard this is what we use and prefer to yellow mustard.",
