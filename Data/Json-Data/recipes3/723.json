I couldn't bear to pollute it with shortening or any other fat - and quite frankly the thicker chocolate coating was perfect for me (but had to use 3 bags of choc chips).  I microwaved the chocolate to melt it, stirring frequently, and used a spoon to dip the balls - much easier than a double boiler and toothpick routine.  And if you're wondering - use creamy peanut butter!",

The scary part is they were way too easy to make. As several other reviewers mentioned chilling the dough after the little balls are made works perfect. Something I didn't read that made it easier for me. Second batch I chilled all the little balls and during that time is when I warmed up my chocolate chips in the microwave that way it was timed perfect instead of the chocolate setting a bit before the balls were chilled. Very good recipe thanks!",
