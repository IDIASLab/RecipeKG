I added lots of grated parmesan cheese, lots of garlic powder and a little onion powder.  I also didn't measure the seasoning salt or the bread crumbs (just eye balled them both).  I think I'll use roasted garlic bread crumbs next time.  I just put it all in to taste.  I also microwaved the cream cheese briefly to make it stirable.  The casserole would be way too bland without some tweaking.  I would definitely make it again if for nothing other than it's ease.",

I ended up dicing up 1/2 of an onion, mushrooms (about 3/4ths of the carton of button mushrooms) and a red pepper. with those additions not only did it look christmas-y, it was FANTASTIC.  I made it again for a New Year's Party, and people devoured it.  I'm sure it's really really good with just spinach, but I do feel like it would be too much like a dip or spread and not a casserole.
