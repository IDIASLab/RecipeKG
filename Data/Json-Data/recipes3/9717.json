It's basically a hybrid of two all time favorites pizza and cheeseburgers- what could be easier or better, right? I added a little garlic to the ground beef and sauteed the onion along with it. I used all reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese (about a cup and a half) and left out the mozzarella altogether. I definitely added the optional shredded lettuce and chopped tomato along with the dill pickle slices. And, while I have to admit that while I love pizza and I love cheeseburgers I think I'll stick to them separately. (Even though my husband loved it) This a really good recipe for a quick meal!",
