The almonds cost $4 and the sugar was probably $2, plus two egg whites and a little almond oil - maybe anyother buck. So it turned out to cost about $7 a pound making it myself, plus the time.\n\nIt was pretty easy to make. When the ground almonds, sugar and eggs are combined, the mixture looks quite shaggy and needs a good kneading. \n\nIt's hard to understand what 12 servings means; it would be better to say how many cups or pounds it makes. \n\nI used it in pignoli cookies, which calls for more sugar and eggs, plus pine nuts to cover the tops. They came out great. ",
