My husband who only likes corn as his vegetable of choice (unless forced to eat something else) and if I do manage to get him to eat a salad his first response for a dressing is \"ranch\" as if it's the only kind ever made. Well we have a winner because he not only tried it but ate an entire bowl of salad plus asked for more and declared it a keeper. I did use 1/2 c. olive oil and 1/4 c. veg. oil (basically switching them) omitted the garlic salt and used 1-2 cloves of minced garlic 1/4 tsp. of onion powder and added a bit of sugar until I got the desired sweetness. I would suggest a name change for this one to get more people to try it \"Mustard Oil Dressing\" is not nearly as appealing as \"Dijon Vinaigrette\".",

Grate onion from your grater and dice garlic for a much more flavorful taste, I make this all the time. I also never buy salad dressings and make all dressings from scratch and people talk about them all the time. Once you master the basics you will always be able to create a dressing not only for salads but many other dishes.  If I could share my recipes I would but I do not measure anything because once you know the ratio's it is very very easy.",

I ground minced garlic (store-bought) salt and pepper in the mortar added the rest of ingredients and whisked. Also I topped with sliced olives. Very good!! Thank you!",
