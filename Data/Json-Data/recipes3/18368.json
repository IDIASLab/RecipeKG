The technique simply involves soaking wings in a sweet, spicy marinade, baking them wet, and then tossing them with a finishing glaze.",

I've made this twice now and definitely recommend finding the ancho chile powder. The second time I made this I ran out and had to substitute half of the ancho with regular chili powder and it just wasn't the same. We like to serve ours with blue cheese and celery but they really don't need any dip- we just like to call that a vegetable side to make it a balance meal.;) Go Bears",
