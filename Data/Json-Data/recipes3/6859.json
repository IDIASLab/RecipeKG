I would reccomend OMITTING the salt. It is plenty salty enough using the soy sauce. I would also recommend slicing (very thin) your cabbage rather then buying the pre bagged stuff. It adds more flavor and juiciness. I also add my dressing right to my bowl of salad right before I eat it.I am going to start using Braggs liquid amino acids. It has 1/3 of the sodium then soy sauce and is actually good for you and tasts the same. Look for it in the health food section by the cider vinager.PLEASE, PLEASE make this. You wont be sorry! I make it at least 2 times a week, and I am not sick of it yet! Also, add the cilantro righ to the dressing, otherwise it stick to the sides of the bowl instead of being\"IN\" the salad. Enjoy friends. I know you will love it.",

I tried to make this recipe according to the directions, then realized I didn't buy the red peppers so subbed carrots, which were good, but I think the recipe as written would be even better.  Still, it was a 5 star recipe.  Use natural peanut butter if you can-it really is easier to work with and tastes more like peanuts.",

I also used aged tamari soy sauce which has much more flavor than the standard supermarket brands.  This was served with sliced pork tenderloin and was the perfect accompanyment.  Will make this one again and again.  Also, followed everyone's advice and made this the morning of my event instead of an hour before.  The longer it sits the better!!  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I used a handful of match stick carrots, no cilantro or sesame seeds (personal taste).  My friend came of to taste test it with me and we both loved it.  I sent 2/3's  of it home with her because my husband won't eat cabbage.  She called later to tell me her mother loved it too.  Now I don't have enough fo myself.  No prob though, it is so easy to make.  I'll just make another half batch and keep it all to myself!  Thank you so much Dawn, for the new addition to my reipe box.  This will be going with me to the next pot luck dinner.  I'm sure there will be lots of guests wanting the recipe.",
