I found all the tastes very distinct: like I was eating haddock onion cream of mushroom soup and cheese rather than a dish where those elements combined nicely. That didn't bother my husband though. I think the onion needs to be sauteed before adding. If you leave the onion raw (even thinly sliced) it's still crisp and raw tasting after cooking. I think adding some crushed ritz crackers on top would have improved the taste as well. While I won't be making this again my husband is certainly glad we tried it once! Thanks.",
