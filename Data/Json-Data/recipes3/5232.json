The dressing was going fine until I added the remaining dressing to the pan where it promptly separated and turned into one big disgusting gloppy mess. (The heat was turned to low...) It was unusable as salad dressing. If one is going to make this I don't recommend heating the remaining dressing but just stirring the heated onion mixture into the room-temp mixture. I am saving the onion mix to hopefully use on chicken or something. The only thing I was able to use was the toasted pine nuts- those were wonderful. I'm kind of upset about the whole thing because it was very time-consuming and then it didn't work (and wasted my good olive oil balsamic vinegar and bacon).",
