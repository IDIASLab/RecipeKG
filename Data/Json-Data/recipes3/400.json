This dessert is usually called \"Banana Split Dessert.\"  My recipe came from my aunt years ago.  I revised it to suit my taste.  Another problem people have is with the filling not setting.  Beat it for a very long time.  I came across a recipe on the internet that suggested beating it for 20 minutes.  I add 1 tsp vanilla extract so I can actually taste the filling.  Lastly, you have build the banana split to your liking.  I like bananas, strawberries, and nut topping.  I also drizzle the fudge or chocolate syrup on individual servings.  You could use milk chocolate chips or chocolate sprinkles instead of a sauce.  Make it your own.  Good luck.",

I did use a different graham cracker crust because I couldn't get recipes crust out of my pan. The graham cracker crust on this site that you had to bake was good. A few tips would be to use 20oz of pineapple. Put the pineapple in a strainer and really get the juices out so your pie doesn't get soggy. I also rinsed and dried my cherries so the red wouldn't run in the cool whip. 8oz of cool whip was plenty. My Mom made the comment that strawberries were missing so I now drizzle strawberry syrup over the filling before the banana and following toppings! Delicious! One more thing I just used a 9 inch pie plate and you need a strong mixer I burnt one up making the cream cheese filling. Now I add a tablespoon of milk and I let the cream cheese soften.",

Make it in a springform tin. 2. Make the crust and cheescake base the night before. 3. There is nothing to \"set\" the cheesecake so add two teaspoons of gelatin (predisolved well in 1/2 cp of hot water) to the mix. 4. Add the final toppings 4 hrs before serving and refrigerate well. 5. Drain the pineapple in a seive first. 6. Use banana slices not quaters 7. USE WHIPPED CREAM TOPPING...YES...GET FRESH CREAM AND WHIP IT WITH TEASPOON OF VANILLA ESSENCE. Don't use premixed toppings. 8. We also found it a bit too sweet and halved the amount of sugar. This makes it just perfect!!",
