I also added a little more cheese since the flavor was not as bold as I had hoped. Since I had no more gorgonzola I used 2 tbsps. or Pecorino romano. Also double garlic and sherry. Bottom line good jumping off point but needs more punch.",

Homemade chicken stock more garlic sherry and a bit more Gorgonzola just perfect this recipe. More soup recipes please \"Bunchkin\"!",
