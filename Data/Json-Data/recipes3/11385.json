They were the favorite by far! I used both mild and cheddar cheese and made a Chive Cream Cheese instead of the butter since I was making a breakfast treat. Super easy to make, they had a great flaky texture and the cheese flavor was so delish. Best served warm so they are melty but I ate plenty at room temp and never complained once!",

My oven also may be a tad under baking. Also, I used a muffin pan and made round biscuits instead of the squares.",

I rolled the outside of dough square a bit too thin before cutting so the outer pieces a bit more dense but the middle biscuits were perfect and had the fluffiest texture!

I used dry chives and need to cut down the amount to 2 Tbsp next time and a hint less cayenne but it was delicious as is.",
