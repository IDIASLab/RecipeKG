As a result, I gave it 4 stars.  I have since made some changes: I divide the oil between sunflower seed and sesame seed oils which gives the dressing a deeper, nuttier flavor.  I also brown the seeds and nuts.  Instead of dried cranberries, I added pomegranate (although this takes more time so if you're in a hurry, I'd skip).  Finally, to speed up preparation, I slice/chop the brussels sprouts in a food processor.  Quick clean up with just a rinse of the food processor.",

Also, I think it could use more dressing, maybe another 1/2 recipe or so, but that's just my opinion. I suggest mixing this and allowing it to 'marinate' in the fridge for a couple hours b/c to me, it was even better that way. Next time I'm gonna add some chopped green onions b/c I think that would be a great addition. Even got hubby to eat Brussels sprouts this way, lol! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I had some leftover crushed pineapple that I served at dinner tonight so I tried combining the two on my plate and it was WAY better - so I suggest to others that either you do not skip the honey or you add sugary fruit (like pineapple) because it really does need the sweetness.",
