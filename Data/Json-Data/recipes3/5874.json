I used a bit more cilantro than called for and added a little light mayonnaise to the slaw rather than oil to make it \"creamier\". I served it with fresh pita bread from a recipe on this site - so easy. I was worried about the burger falling apart so I added some extra breadcrumbs but it actually stayed together really well and the whole concoction just tasted so fresh and wonderful. We re-heated two of them to eat the next day and it tasted just as good as the day before. I can't wait to make these again!",

I also made a thai satay sause to serve with the burgers. I served cous-cous made with canned lite coconut juice and pine nuts as well as the slaw. Pickles onions etc. I shall keep this reciped FOREVER. May I suggest also trying Salmon Burgers. FANTASTIC!!",
