This pan has 24 holes, so we made a batch of 24 and then a batch of 6. We thought they were good, and understand the reviews left here. I agree that this is a BASIS recipe and is wide-open to tweaks and taste chnages - like add chilli, and/or garlic, use other cheeses etc etc etc. But they should carry a warning ... we nibbled these as we chatted over a glass of wine and were shocked toi find that 18 had disappeared. And then we remembered the second batch still in the oven! They weren't burnt but severely sun-tanned. And we actually thought that they just might even have tasted better. Slightly thicker outer skin, but the cheese came though much more strongly! I will be making these often. And by the way, after consuming 18 between us, we weren't hungry any more, so we put all the stuff for dinner back into the fridge for use today!",

I added a clove of garlic to the pan with the onions and added a pinch of paprika to the mixture and they turned out quite flavorful.

I didn't have the self rising flour so I made my own from Canadian Mama suggestion :) I didn't have large zucchinis so I used two small ones, 2 carrots, real bacon bits, 1/2 and 1/2 cream and bacon drippings instead of olive oil. I made them to go with soup for lunch and my 2 and 5 yr olds didn't even touch the soup, just the \"muffins\" ;) I also made them in the reg size muffin cups and it made a full dozen. There's only one left for my husband to try, and they came out of the oven an hour ago lol. I think I may try to double or triple the batch and freeze them for quick breakfasts or to go with soup.",
