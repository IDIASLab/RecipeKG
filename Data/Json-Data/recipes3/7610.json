I did make some slight changes to it though. I replace the pork with boneless skinless chicken thighs and added an extra jalapeno for heat. Then I added a two more tablespoons of honey to up the sweetness to balance. Finally I found the sauce simply too runny so I thickened it at the end of cooking with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with water. Served over hot cooked rice even my three young picky boys gobbled it up. I will definitely make this recipe again",
