I'm usually able to make it with leftover rice and produce we just tend to have around the house, making the only \"cooking\" the chicken.  I throw 3 chicken breasts in the crock pot first thing in the morning, season them heavily with kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, cayenne, chili powder, red pepper flakes and paprika.  After 4 hours I put them in a bowl and just pull them apart with forks.  I also add a can of  rinsed black beans to the mix.  Serve it over butter lettuce which is often in abundance in folks backyards in summer.  We're big fans.  Great, easy, refreshing summer lunch!",

Instead of using plain white rice I used some leftover Mexican Rice I had on hand which turned out great and gave it even more flavor. Due to personal preference I cut back the amount of Jalapeno I used to only 1/3 the pepper and the Chili Powder to only 1/4 tsp which was spicy enough for our palates. I also used half the amount of Cilantro recipe called for as I felt entire amount would've given it too strong of a flavor. Husband loved it and said this recipe's a keeper and I agree with him! Update to review: we were only able to eat 1/2 the filling for one meal so I saved the other half to serve the next day. I found the lime juice in the dressing made it a bit sour after sitting a day so in making the dressing the next time I added about 1/2 Tbsp Honey that cut back on the sourness. Much better this way.",
