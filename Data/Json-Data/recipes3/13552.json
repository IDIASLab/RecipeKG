My family loves pizza but we have a gluten sensitivity so to find this recipe has brought pizza night back into our menu. We thank you for sharing your recipe! My suggestion is don't rush the process. Cook the crust a bit longer so the crust is crispier on the edges. So good! I don't use cheese on our pizza either, instead I make a nice vegan cheesy sauce & drizzle the top with that. I also use a vegan egg substitute. Love this recipe!!!",
