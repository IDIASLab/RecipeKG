After simmering for an hour I had to add probably close to 2 additional cups of water to make it a soup. I pureed 2 ladles full of the soup in the blender and mixed it back into the soup for some creaminess in the texture. The soup is thick and hearty and nutritious great for a cold day. Some fresh warm bread and a green salad makes it an easy meal. Next time I may experiment with some spices because although it was good I felt maybe it needed a little kick or a subtle spice in the background. But all in all a god recipe. It makes a lot of soup and it's very economical so it was great to make on a Sunday for lunch at work during the week.",
