I used 2% milk instead of almond milk (2 1/2 cups instead of 3) I used 1/2 a cup of sugar instead of 2/3 I put blops of cream cheese (about 1/4 cup total) on top before baking. I baked this covered for 1 hour and then uncovered for an additional 10 minutes. No sogginess in the middle at all after that.",
