With 1 1/2 cups it was very 'grainy' but the extra 1/2 c milk gave it a smooth creamy texture and still set up perfectly!",

I couldn't justify not using all of them though so I mixed all but 8 of the berries in with the top layer of whipped cream layered on top of the chocolate pudding layer and then garnished with some sliced almonds that I had left over from another pie some toasted coconut and the rest of the berries. Had I had some extra chocolate on hand this would have been very pretty lightly dusted with cocoa powder and with some chocolate curls. One thing though I have never heard of whipped topping envelopes in my life. When I asked about them at the grocery store no one had any idea what I was talking about. I decided to go ahead and use two 8 ounce packages of fat free cool whip instead. When I initially added the chocolate pudding mix to the one 8 oz package of cool whip it was kind of pasty so I decided to add some 1% milk. I added a cup and it was still kind of grainy so I added another cup. It was good but didn't set up as well as I would have liked. Next time I think I will try using only 1 1/2 cups of milk.",
