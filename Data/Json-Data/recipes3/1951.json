That was way too much (you may not need to add any) so I used some potatoes to remove some of the salt flavor which seemed to work pretty well (though it sounds like a myth to me). I really enjoyed this combination of flavors. I used more sausage than what was called for close to a pound which was a good choice. Next time I will add more oysters or not chop them as finely.
