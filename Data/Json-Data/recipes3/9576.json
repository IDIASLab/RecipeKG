I called my local supermarket and had them special order them for me just to make this recipe :-) I thought it produced a very juicy tasting chicken. I was surprised that it did not have an overwhelming orange taste to it. The sauce is yummy, and I didn't have any white wine, but I did have red wine, so I used that in the sauce and it still tasted great. That is the only thing I did differently about this recipe, otherwise, I followed it exactly. I wouldn't change anything. Great dish!",

I did made a few alterations, the first was using blood orange flavored olive oil that I already had in and second  I did not use two separate pans. Rather removed the chicken to rest then added the onions and garlic to the same pan. After softened, i added the wine, chicken stock and using a flat whisk scraped all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. before returning the chicken to the pan to finish cooking through. Then I added the honey and some Corn starch (mixed with cold water to make a paste) to thicken\n the sauce. This turned out great, and I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!!",
