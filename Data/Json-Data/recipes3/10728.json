I made these for father's day with ground sirloin and used King's Hawaiian Rolls for the buns and added some baby spinach leaves for greenery. I did NOT add the yogurt to the mix rather placed a dollop on the burger as it was being assembled. The brie complimented the yogurt well and the dijon added a good spice to the mix. Everyone (even the less adventurous eaters) loved them. Next time I think I'll add some carmelized sweet onions to the assembly as well.",
