There were 15 people there at the most and the dip was gone by the end of the night! I will make this again and again!! Thanks for the great recipe!",

Throw that in a crock pot with 2-8oz. Bricks of 1/3 less fat Neufchatel/Cream Cheese (To those of you that said Lite - BAD idea it works absolutely perfectly I never use full fat cream cheese anymore even in cheesecakes it comes out great - the non-fat is a different story) And 2 cans of Rotel/Diced Tomatoes with Chilis... throw it in the crock on High til it bubbles turn it to low and leave out for the party!",
