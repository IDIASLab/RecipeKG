I like it spicy so I left the seeds in the habanero when making the harissa. Make this recipe exactly as is but keep in mind that the longer you marinade the chicken the more flavorful it will be. Between 3-8 hours if you have the patience to wait that long. Also Cut the final cooking time down by 5 minutes or the chicken will come out on the dry side and the veggies will be overdone. At least that was my experience. Making the harissa is a little tedious but sooooo worth it! One of my favorite sauces and can be put on anything.",
