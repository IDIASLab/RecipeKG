You can use pork or ham instead of the chicken to change it up. You can also add fresh grape tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, or broccoli. I am sure there are many other varieties; these are just what i have used in the past.",

Also be careful with honey as it can easily get too sweet (and horrible). Perhaps you can omit it altogether. Instead of lemon zest and sherry vinegar I added 2 tbsp lemon juice at the end and it was just right. Also instead of heavy cream I used no fat half&half and thickened it with flour--the texture and taste were still perfect.",

I used whole wheat penne instead of spaghetti added the juice of half a lemon with the chicken broth and substituted the heavy cream with 1% buttermilk. I needed to add a little cornstarch and water for the sauce to thicken - probably a result of using the buttermilk. Small price to pay to save a whole lot of fat and calories. Tasted great thank you for the wonderful recipe.",
