(NB: I also added oregano and basil to the tomato sauce and nutmeg to the white sauce so they smelled and tasted good.) The spaghetti though slightly undercooked still got mushy in a 335 degree oven for 25 mins. (lower and less than the recipe called for). I like the layered idea and may try it again but I'll use a thicker pasta (e.g. mostaccioli or penne) and make more of both sauces.",
