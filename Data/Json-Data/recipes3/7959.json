Don't let the applesauce scare you off; you can't taste it, but it keeps the meatballs tender and moist. Add mushrooms and/or pearl onions for an even heartier 'comfort' meal! Serve over hot buttered noodles or rice. We like a salad and garlic bread, or a plate of sliced tomatoes and cucumbers. Enjoy!",

I only had 1 pound of 85/15 sirloin. I had homemade ww seasoned bread crumbs so I used a bit less milk. I only had monterrey jack. I always sneak veggies in so I added garlic carrots and celery with the onion & chopped very fine in the food processor. I cooked them at 325 for longer just to make sure the carrots cooked. We are eating it over ww penne. Delish! I'll make meatballs with natural applesauce often!",

Used one can of cream of celery and one of cream of potato and 1% milk (added 1 T. of flour) for the sauce because that's what I had. Very tasty sauce over either mashed potatoes or noodles and served with steamed asparagus. Definitely a keeper!",
