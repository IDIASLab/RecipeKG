We didn't have any malt vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar which was probably a mistake as the biscuits were rather vinegarry.

I certainly didn't notice ANY vinegar taste - it's only a 1/2 tbsp after all.  Though I don't know why it's in the recipe - I will try it without to compare.  One of the reviewers commented negatively on the Baking Soda.  There isn't any, so is it fair to penalize the recipe?    Good flavour  and texture in these biscuits, which I made with my own biscuit mix.",
