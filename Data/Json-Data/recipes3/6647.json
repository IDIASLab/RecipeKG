But with a few small additions these are easily elevated to five stars particularly if you re an artichoke lover like me. (I love artichokes so much that Santa used to put them in my Christmas stocking when I was a kid but I digress) More butter a chunk of cream cheese and fresh parsley sage rosemary and thyme made these exceptional. Ahhh for summer when otherwise expensive fresh herbs are plentiful right in your own back yard! I d like to try other herbs as well fresh oregano dill or rosemary are all interesting possibilities. Very creative recipe.",

I roasted a few cloves of garlic and threw that into the food processor with the artichokes and milk.
