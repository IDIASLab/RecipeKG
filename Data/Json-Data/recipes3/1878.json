To the simmering chicken I doubled the amount of garlic powder and onion powder and added 1/2 teaspoon of fajita seasoning. To the pitas I added monterey jack / colby cheese and diced onions to the pitas. I made these changes because previous reviewers commented on the chicken not being flavorful enough. My recipe was scaled to 4 servings. Even though my pita did fall apart (I always try to pack too much in), I really enjoyed these. My favorite part was the avocado. Delicious! In the future I plan on doubling the amount of salsa used to make it a little more saucey.",
