I've made several changes, and it turned out beautifully: 8oz. of egg noodles were boiled and placed in the bottom of a casserole dish.  I then put in the frozen broccoli along with a few sliced carrots.  I browned the meat with the onions and added a few cloves of garlic as well as a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  I used a Cheddar-Jack mix and reduced the cheese from FOUR CUPS (woah!) to about two.  This recipe is very versatile and there are a countless number of things that can be added or substituted.  Delicious and very easy to make!",

I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt for a little more flavor.",

Both times I have to half the measurements for the beef (1 pound), broccoli (14oz frozen chopped broccoli), onion(1/2cup)because it's just 3 of us in the house. Tonight, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, 1 can of cream of broccoli soup, 1 cup of sour cream, added seasoned salt and pepper to the meat while browning along with the onion and 2tsp of minced garlic. I sliced 4 small red new potatoes (skins left on for color contrast), microwaved for 5 minutes with seasoned salt and pepper sprinkled over them to help get them done quicker. Mixed soup/sour cream mixture, meat, and potatoes into a 9x13 casserole dish stirred well then sprinkled with 1 small can of french fried onion strings for some crunch. Left out the cheese this time as it is creamy enough with the soup mixture. Baked uncovered at 350 for 20-30 minutes. Thanks for a great base recipe.",
