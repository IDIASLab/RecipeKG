I gave this one 3 stars because it does have the potential to be great. 1st and foremost if you make it as written you better like salty foods. Next time I'll add the salt after the quinoa is done cooking before it cools. Black pepper could be switched for white pepper or eliminated all together. Instead of garlic powder and salt try a good solid 1/4 tsp garlic salt or what I'll be trying next time is Garlic gourmet Zesty Garlic. I added apricot because my mango was pretty small next time though I think I'd like to add some color intstead cranberries has been mentioned but I think strawberries or tart cherries would also freshen it up a bit. I also toasted some almonds and gave em a rough chop. I'll definately try it again but absolutely not as written.",

I didn t find this recipe too salty but that is very dependent on the broth that you use (so taste test before adding the salt and add a little at a time). I made the recipe as is and taste tested each step of the way (just to see what adding each thing did for the flavor). I used an African curry that I brought back from Morocco which really complimented the sweet mango flavor well. For texture I added pine nuts right at the end. I also confess I didn t wait for this to cool down I ate it hot and loved it. I ll experiment a little with the leftovers (trying it cold for one). I think adding a squeeze of lime and a little cayenne could step this up a notch but this was delicious as is.",
