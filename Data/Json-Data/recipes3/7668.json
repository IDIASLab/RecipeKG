I didn't fry it first mostly because I needed my hands to do other things to get dinner ready in a hurry. I followed the direction exactly except after I floured them I also dipped them in panko.  I put them on a greased cookie sheet and baked on 450 for about 20 mins.  Once they can be pierced with a fork, I took them out and put tomato sauce, a generous amount of parmesan and then grated mozzarella and put them back in at 350 for about 5-10 minutes to melt cheese.  Baking them made them plenty crispy and really delicious!  My guess is too much oil could make them soggy if you weren't careful.",

I coated the eggplant in eggs and breadcrumbs rather than flour and since they were seasoned it gave the pizzas a bit of flavor. When I fried them I used just enough oil to coat the pan and they dried them w/ a paper towel before baking 2). I added veggie italian sausage, mushrooms and onion and I stir-fried the veggies a bit first so they were tender.\n\nThis recipe was even liked by my very picky 5-year old daughter (of course I just told her they were pizzas, but after she ate 2 I told her it was eggplant and she didn't believe me!).",

I changed the ingredients a bit because I used crushed plain Cheerios Ritz crackers and a touch of cornmeal to bread then let them bake in the oven for about 15 min for each side (I cut very thick slices a little over half an inch but don't recommend cutting so thick; I got knife happy lol) then took them out and added the sauce cheese and mushrooms (sauteed). I let them cook for ten more min. then took them out. Great recipe and I'll definitely try it again!!",
