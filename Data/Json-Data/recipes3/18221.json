Beef stew is usually reserved for the crock pot in my house so it can simmer away all day - but no need to wait hours when the instant pot will have veggies and beef super tender with just a 20 minute cook time. I thought this was delicious. And you can certainly play with the seasonings however you like, but I didn't change anything.",
