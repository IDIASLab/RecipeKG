Great with hash browns and toast for a weekend breakfast, lunch, whatever! My daughter likes to dip this in ketchup. Excellent in a sandwich. For a low-fat version you can also bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) on a nonstick baking sheet for 15 to 20 minutes.",

I ate the tofu slices as is just with a side of veggies but I think I will definitely use this on a sandwich or in a Buddha bowl. The only issue I had was to get the yeast to stick. It stuck to my fingers more than the tofu at one point. So next time I will use the plastic bag method to help get the coating evenly over the tofu. Thank you for the recipe.",
