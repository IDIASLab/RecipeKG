Baking causes water to evaporate, leaving an intensely sweet and flavorful potato.  Absolutely no sugar needed.  In the past, I've boiled my sweet potatoes, which made them lose a lot of their flavor.  Pureeing in a food processor gave them a creamy and airy quality that I never got with mashing by hand.  The only changes I made to make it healthier was to use fat free buttermilk, 1% milk, and half the butter.  It was still unbelievably creamy with these substitutions.  My husband, who doesn't care for sweet potatoes went back for thirds.",

It wasn't spicy or sweet but more buttery just like this recipe. I used to always order it. I started with 3 sweet potatoes. After they were baked I weighed them and they came out to be 1lb peeled. So, I just halved the rest of the ingredients. I added everything but no pepper. For the buttermilk I just did 2% milk and a couple drops of vinegar and let it sit. With the butter I used whipped butter to cut the saturated fat in half. I always roast sweet potatoes at 410 deg., for about an hour, and did the same with this recipe. I don't have a food processor, so I used the blender but I had to stop and stir a few times. I will definitely be making this every year. Thank you for posting a simple, basic, creamy recipe for mashed sweet potatoes.",

It was really creamy and looked pretty but I thought that there was something not quite right about the flavor. Perhaps I just don't care for the buttermilk in it.

It was the perfect consistency for me. When I was growing up candied sweet potatoes were always served with greens--usually turnip or collards--so I sauteed some collard greens with onions and a spalsh of Dale's a drop of liquid smoke and a nice splash of apple cider vinegar. Took me back to my childhood only it was better! I would suggest adding a little of the milks and then checking your consistency--mine would have been a soup had I added a whole cup of milk!",
