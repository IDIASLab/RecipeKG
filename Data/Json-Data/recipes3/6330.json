I also added a tomato some chopped red onion and about 1/2 cup chopped cilantro. The salad part was very good but the chicken was only ok. I put it all on rice for dinner and used it in a wrap the next day. I will deffinately make this again maybe using a different recipe for the chicken. The salad is amazing though and my 7 year old ate it two days in a row cleaning her plate. Very good!",

I made this for a baby shower for 40 women. I would suggest using half the beans and either use more mango or add pineapple. I even had a little marinade left over for another time.",
