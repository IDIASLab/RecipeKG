We don't use it very often and maybe that is due to how expensive it is to buy in the store. Why is it so expensive anyway when it is this easy and affordable to make? Going into this recipe I just knew it was going to be a big fail and I would get my answer as to why store bought was so expensive. Negative. I actually made this last night and the end result was so impressive that I couldn't stop thinking about it all day today at work. I wanted to tell everyone around me but they are not foodies and would have had no interest in listening. I did let it sit too long and it was a little too thick but that was my own fault.  This recipe is excellent! Once you try this you will never go back to store bought again.",
