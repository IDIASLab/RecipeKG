Because of the longer cooking time I used shrimp that were large, size 16/20. I cooked the shrimp for a few minutes then added the garlic until fragrant. I didn't add the salt to the mushrooms until they were cooked, adding salt at the beginning will draw out the water, total cooking time will be 15 minutes. Should I make this again I will add 1 tbs of butter, at the end, to make it silky. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

I also added more salt and pepper to taste and some dried onion. They both loved it. I will be making it again (but with the half and half):)",
