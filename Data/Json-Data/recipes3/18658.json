                "reviewBody": "Sorry this salsa didn't suit me at all! I was very disappointed w/ the outcome of this. As the recipe directed I prepared everything in advance allowing time to sit overnight so that I could serve it w/ chicken tacos the next day. I was a bit worried about how this would turn out b/c it tasted VERY bitter (I \"tested\" tiny spoonfuls as I was making it) despite adding extra honey to compensate. Something about the jalapeno seemed out of place to me as well. Hoping that the flavors would \"meld\" overnight I took another \"test\" sample b4 making dinner and at that point decided to toss it all (my fiance didn't try this; he HATES cranberries so therefore topped his tacos w/ \"traditional\" condiments). I 1/2'd the yield amount so I have plenty of cranberries cilantro and honey left to use in other recipes (as well as the booze I already had in my pantry - for drinking!) but the 's spent on jalapenos and limes were a total waste. I think this recipe needs sugar to sweeten it NOT honey. If you think about it the tartness of traditional cranberry sauce is balanced w/ sugar so why mess w/ what already works (?). Oh and I did freeze my cranberries 1st and then allowed them to thaw b4 processing (which I don't think made that much of a difference IMHO). Too bad! This would have been a nice fall salsa to add to my recipe box. It seems that most people enjoyed your recipe Bluestocking but unfortunately it wasn't to our liking:(",

So for the reviewer \"Mickey\" I think I understand your disappointment and fresh chopped onions is what was missing for you. I also used the salsa for our holiday dressing rather than traditional cranberry sauce and added cream cheese of course for a spread.",
