                "reviewBody": "First off I LOVED the flavor of this soup and how easy it was to make. I used Jennie-O Italian sausage (3 links = 3/4lb). I used fresh spinach instead of frozen about 2/3 of a bag and that's just because of personal preference. I did not add any salt and it was plenty salty. I can't imagine having added 2 tsp. Of course if you use unsalted chicken broth or low sodium you'll want to add salt to taste. The issue I had was that because you are cooking the barley for so long to get it tender a lot of the liquid evaporates leaving you with 6 very small servings (about 6oz each). I had even added 1 cup of water to the pot. In my opinion this makes 3 lunch size portions so plan accordingly. I will definitely be making this again though with the extra liquid. Thank you Juli for the tasty and healthy recipe!",
