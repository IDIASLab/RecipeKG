I intended to make the recipe as written and I pretty much did just a few small changes: I cut back on the cream cheese and monterey jack in the filling to try to trim the fat and calorie numbers; I didn't add anywhere near 15 oz of tomato sauce - I bought an 8 oz can and didn't use the whole thing it seemed like it was definitely liquidy enough with this small amount and tasted tomato-ey too; I accidentally used basil instead of parsely but it still tasted good; and I can never find canned enchilada sauce and I didn't feel like making a proper one so I used tomatillo salsa mixed with some sour cream as sauce. Thanks for the recipe! I enjoyed:)",

I was amazed that the cleanup from the onion, cream cheese, cheese...mix was so easy. I kept the heat around 3 (pretty low). Other than those mods I made it as written. This would be a great dish to make for company. Serve with Spanish rice and refried beans - oh my the guests will be more than satisfied! Thanks!!",

I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of green peppers and tomato sauce which added a nice heat. I would also omit the Monterrey Jack cheese in the filling due to the salt it adds to the dish and just use the full amount of cream cheese using more chicken. I used twice the amount of chicken the recipe called for, and it made the consistency of the filling just right....I will try this again with these minor adjustments and see how it goes.",
