I added a pinch of pepper to the sauce when it was done cooking. I cut the shrimp in smaller pieces once they were done cooking. The overall taste of the sauce was quite pleasant and different from the cream sauces I've had. The orange zest added a little something that made this sauce quite unique. I think it needed a little more garlic in the sauce; the shrimps were seasoned nicely. I served this over store-bought porcini mushroom-stuffed tortelloni. We like out pasta dishes saucy so we will double that portion of the recipe next time. I would definitely make this again!",

I split the sauce between the two meats,so very very good, the orange is a nice flavor and not at all over powering.I asked my husband to rate he said 10. I asked why he said because I made scallops LOL I asked what about the sauce, he replied it was banging and then I put the scallops in and made it heaven.",

I also didn't let the scallops heat for 5' it took about 3' and then I pulled them off the low heat. They were perfect. I followed other reviewers advice and added a little more pepper to the sauce.
