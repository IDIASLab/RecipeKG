I love it that no one had a clue about the lentils (tiny red ones cook up unrecognizable) and the spinach (they thought it was \"herbs\").  The only changes I made were to use just lentils instead of the soup, and half a jar of pasta sauce + one chopped tomato, and a bigger pasta shape (it's all I had on hand).  Add your own spices and you've got a big hit!",

The few modifications I did were: 1) added more red pepper flakes (to make it more spicy) 2) used whole grain rotini instead 3) added a few sprinkles of lemon juice to give the pasta a slight tangy flavor. Overall it was wonderful! Will definitely make it again...and again!",
