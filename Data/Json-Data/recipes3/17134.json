They like avocado guacamole so I figured I was safe calling it a veggie dip cause they will not eat asparagus. I would never have thought to do this with asparagus.  Also, the neat thing about this recipe, you can work with what you have on hand and even add sourcream to make it richer if you like. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

Made the recipe as is but found the end resulting color alittle gray I think maybe I over cooked the asparagus. Also the mouth feel was not buttery like avacado. So I had some frozen peas cooked for a few minutes and threw them in the food processor with a bit of EVOO took care of the color and added richness without blowing the calorie count.",
