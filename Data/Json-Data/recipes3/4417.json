For those of you who are as skeptical about the peanut butter as I was don't be...it works and you can't really tell it's there. I think I would still stick with 3 tbsp peanut butter instead of 4 otherwise the peanut butter taste might be more obvious. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I found that the sauce was still too spicy for my family's taste (even my husband thought it was too spicy which is rare). I also thought there was too much sauce you could probably cut the recipe in half. Then again maybe if it were less spicy we would have used more sauce. I loved the spices used on the chicken and I really enjoyed how everything tasted together. In the future I will probably use only 1 pepper maybe even a little less. Thanks for the awesome recipe!",
