I do love variations of basic egg salad with different and even unusual add-ins.  But it was nice this time, to stick to a more pedestrian version.  I did make the basic recipe, including the green onion, but substituted sour cream for the plain yogurt, which I have never used.  It was delicious!  I do have to say, however, that the best part for me was to use the ingenious suggestion of the potato masher!  I\u2019ve never done that before and now that I have I won\u2019t forget it!  Makes quick work of chopping the eggs!  Finally, all of the listed variations sound interesting and delicious as well.   I look forward to trying them all.",
