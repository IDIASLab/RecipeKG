Since I never have heavy cream on hand, I substituted about half 1% milk and half cream cheese, and once the cream cheese melted it worked really well. This would be gorgeous with chopped scallions on top (if only I'd had some!).  Next time I make it I'll serve it with rice to soak up more of the yummy sauce.",

The only changes that I made were that I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream (it was all I had) and I didn't add salt. I fried then simmered the chops on the longer side of what the recipe suggested as they were bone-in and very thick. They were crispy looking (I don't eat pork) and the sauce reduced nicely. They smelled amazing while they were cooking. I will be making these again and again. Thanks Tina C.!",

I think the 3/4 C of wine may have been a tad to much.  In the end it was the predominant taste in the gravy.  Also, my cream curdled as soon as it hit the pan, which I thought was odd.  Finally the garlic powder never fully incorporated into the gravy.  If I did this again I would use fresh garlic and sub chicken stock for the wine.",

I did take the advice of another reviewer and did everything up to the end of the recipe but then stuck them in my dutch oven and put them into the oven for an hour at 250. They just feel apart! No knife needed!!!! Then I made a gravy from the brown bits left in my fry pan by using a little butter to get all the bits up then added some flour just a teaspoon at a time to thicken. Then I added some of the same wine in prob. 3/4 cup and brought to a boil and lastly I turned it to low and added some cream to make a gravy. (Used all the same ingred. of the pork chops besides the garlic for the gravy. Although I did add some salt and pepper to the gravy.) These pork chops are truely one of my favorites now!!!! My son even said it was just like a meal from a fine dining restaurant!!! I will make again and again! Thank You!!",
