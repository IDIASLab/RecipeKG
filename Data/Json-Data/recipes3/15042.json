        "description": "This is a simple and easy lunch or dinner recipe for chicken curry with kabocha pumpkin and eggplant. It's delicious, and the ingredients used are simple and easy to find. It's a great way to incorporate vegetables with meat in a dish so you get a well-balanced meal. This dish is very easy to make and is ready in less than 40 minutes. For this recipe, I've used chicken wingettes which can be cooked evenly in a microwave because of their flat shape. Serve over rice.",
