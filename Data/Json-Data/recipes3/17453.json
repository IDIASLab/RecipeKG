It's super easy to prepare and the flavor was solid. I butterflied a few chicken breasts and seasoned them with Salt Pepper and Garlic and then I followed the recipe exactly after that. It really is as easy to make as the recipe sounds... from start to finish it took 15 minutes at the most. If you need something quick tasty and family friendly this is a good meal for you. Cheers!",

Because I worried about the chicken being cooked thoroughly I cut it into smaller pieces and cooked it some more. I would suggest pounding the meat prior to browning to make sure they're all the same thickness. This recipe was easy to make and a hit. I will definitely make it again and perhaps throw some frozen vegetables into the chicken/soup/milk mix and let it cook on the stove a bit longer. The rice was excellent - I'll use that part of the recipe again and again.",
