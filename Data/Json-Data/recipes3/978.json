There is one difference in her recipe though, and I think it makes a big difference. For the crust on the bottom, she used 1cup flour, 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup walnuts. after you mix and press into the bottom of the pan only bake 20 minutes tops. This recipe gives you a crispy crust that not only tastes better (in my opinion) but holds up and spreads without crumbling into your first layer.  Otherwise, this recipe is great and I am glad it is here!  You'll love it!",

I added 3 Tbsp sugar, added almond flavoring and vanilla flavoring and used chopped pistachio nuts instead of walnuts.  I baked it for 25 minutes.  The crust then had a cookie taste and everyone liked it.  I found that I couldn't really taste the cream cheese layer so next time I will double that layer.",

This is a wonderful recipe; I'll just make it with real whipped cream next time.  It will really make a difference (as might some shaved chocolate, either white or regular).  Nice complexity, with the crunch crust, rich cream cheese layer and creamy pudding & topping.  Took to a work potluck and people went crazy.  Brought the few remaining pieces home and they were devoured for dessert.  Delicious.  I also only added 3/4 cup powdered sugar vs. the prescribed 1 cup and glad I did.  Was not overly sweet this way.  Highly recommend (but remember the real whipped cream!).",
