Remember that if the liquid reduces by half on the stove it will be twice as salty as it was originally and most canned chicken broths are too salty in the first place!",

If you reduce 64 ounces (a half gallon!) of broth to a stew-like consistency of course its going to be salty,  not to mention it's going to take forever to cook down!  I used half the amount of chicken broth called for.  I cooked it at fairly high heat rather than a simmer, and didn't return the chicken to the pan until it was almost the consistency I was after, tho' I did add a little cornstarch slurry to give the sauce some viscosity. As for seasoning, I wanted more than just the salt and pepper called for before dredging the chicken in the flour, so I gave it a good sprinkle of Montreal Chicken Seasoning as well, which worked well with the thyme (I used fresh).  This was delicious.  A simple mirepoix (or soffritto in Italian) was transformed into something sublime - and it took about half an hour from start to finish.  I served this over rice alongside steamed zucchini.",

I knew I wanted to mix in pasta so I needed the chicken to be smaller. I actually returned the chicken to the pot after cooking the mirepoix and let everything go on low for 2 hours. I used half the stock called for (a reduced sodium brand after reading the other comments) to create a thicker consistency. I cooked off 8 oz of radiatore pasta and mixed it all together. I topped it with  grated Pecorino Romano cheese for added bite and with the rest of the bottle of wine, my husband and I had a fantastic meal.",

I love it that it has this delicious thick gravy that you don't have to make with butter flour and cream. I followed ingredients exactly. For salt and pepper to taste I added 1/2 tsp of each. Since I used store-bought broth next time I'll nix all the extra salt (for chicken and for sauce). Simmered exactly how long they suggested but it was still too watery so I boiled it on high for another 30 minutes (on top of the 120 minutes) and it was perfect. The chicken is amazingly tender and the flavor of it all is superb. We served it over mashed potatoes and were sooooo pleased.",
