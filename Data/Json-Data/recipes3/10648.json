Of course I added some additional spices as I do to every recipe (garlic pwdr onion pwrd white pepper) and did use some jarred ginger paste and hot pepper flakes. But it was delicious! Good base recipe! I would ensure you don't cut the chicken into too small of pieces or they can get overcooked by the time bigger ones are done thoroughly. I even used frozen Normandy mix veggies with the fresh zucchini since that's all I had and it still turned out good! I also just used a 90 second packet of microwave brown rice/quinoa from Costco to save time. I will definitely be making this again and again. Tip: if you are watching salt use some unsalted chicken broth/stock and less soy and oyster to taste!",
