My girlfriend's husband is from El Salvador and her mother-in-law gave me the recipe but there were no radieshes or red pepper flakes. Oh well to each their own. To me radishes are very potent. The longer the lemon juice blends with the tomato juice the more flavor you get. The cilantro adds the perfect zing. I usually put this on top of yellow rice although it can be used with chips. I have even eaten it w/o anything else lol!",
