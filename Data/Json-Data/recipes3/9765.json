The trickiest part was baking until \"lightly browned\" since it has honey and cinnamon it's that color to start with. So to be safe I baked at a slightly lower temp and tested the nuts at 15 minutes. Ended up taking about 20 minutes to get done. I substituted oil for butter and a mix of pecans and cashews for the almonds.",
