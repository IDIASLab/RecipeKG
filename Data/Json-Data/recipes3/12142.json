I made per the recipe though I did leave my cucumbers a touch bigger than \"minced\" and used white pepper in place of black pepper per personal preference. The only person who didn't care for these was someone who doesn't care for goat cheese which is to be expected. I can see myself making these again for a last minute snack for unexpected guests. THANKS for the recipe!",

The thin Pretzel Crisp underneath helped ground it and add an extra touch of salt while also providing texture. My entire dinner party enjoyed this!",
