Strangely enough, after spending a few days in the fridge, the aftertaste was almost gone.  I have since discovered, when comparing Swerve (Erythritol) to Splenda (Sucralose), that Splenda is about 30% sweeter.  So next time I bake these cookies with Splenda, I will use about 30% less.   That might help with the aftertaste.  Because it wasn't specified, I used unsalted butter.  Next time I'm going to try it with sated butter to see how that affects the flavor.   Also, I thought that 12.7 grams of carbs per cookie listed in the nutrition info was very high, so I did the research and crunched the numbers.  With Swerve there are 2.1 g of carbs per cookie.  With Splenda granulated, there are 3.1 g of carbs.  That makes more sense.",

I did cook these for the minimal time & I made them slightly bigger than 1\u201d because I like cookies really soft. Spray your fork with cooking spray before crisscrossing on cookies to avoid sticking. The only thing I might try next time would be to add a little almond extract. Overall, my husband & I both liked them very much. Which says a lot since he never eats or drinks anything with artificial sweetener in it!!",

The sweetner I used was 1/3 Now brand Erythritol and 2/3 Betterleaf powdered Stevia, I dislike the cooling effect of Erythritol over slight bitterness of Stevia, first time I\u2019ve split like that, read other recipes that suggested and it worked. I had neither effects from either one. Would like tad sweeter next time, I was just under measure on both sweetener because I was afraid it'd be cool/bitter with my concoction. I even cooked them in my toaster oven as my big oven is under the weather, came out perfect, didn\u2019t flatten as in pic, even though I flattened as stated, but didn\u2019t press with fork for two reasons, I wanted some volume so don\u2019t get why you\u2019d flatten them to begin with and also I was raised with the crossed fork press was only for Peanut Butter cookies growing up, so I\u2019ma gonna keep it that way, seems everyone is fork pressing every flavor . My house smelt divine for hours after, I let them cool, kept one out and stored remaining in container in fridge, got more than 12, got 16. I used Costco almond flour, Kerrygold butter, Egglands Best Eggs from there as well, such a bargain. I could see where non-keto\u2019ers would enjoy and not know. Also I prefer room temp or slightly warmed to bring out that warn cinnamon vibe. Great for the holidays or not, get an awesome cookie and with the smell of Christmas in the house, win-win.
