I didn\u2019t have the lime flavored seasoning, so just used some Tone\u2019s Zesty Country Seasoning, and increased the amount to 1 tsp. in the crust mixture.  I also used Italian seasoned Panko. It was very easy to mix so no blender was needed, Yay! I baked at 425 for 15 mins. just until meat turned opaque and crust browned, and that kept the fillets from drying out.  I think this recipe would work well with any good quality halibut or other firm, white fish.",
