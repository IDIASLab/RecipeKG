In the morning (midweek)I toasted SLICED almonds while I made up the egg mixture (as I am a fan of almonds but not almond extract and to go with the hawaiian bread, I substituted coconut flavoring), dipped about half of the precut bread and put in a pan in the refrigerator while I went and did my hair and makeup, came back pressed the almonds into the sticks and layed them all at the same time on my new electric family-sized griddle, cooked them about 15 mins @ 300 degrees, dusted them with powdered sugar, handed each family member an individual cup of syrup (available at my local 99 cent store) and off we all went! Delicious, fun and easy. Leftovers heated for 20 seconds in the microwave were terrific the next day, too. Next time, I'm going to try it with toasted coconut! Thanks. This one is a keeper!",
