The veggies were already a good texture but might have benefited from being just a tad softer. Regardless still a 5 star dish I would make again.",

I cut my potatoes too small which resulted in them not holding their shape but the flavor was still there. With all of the cheese in this dish I was expecting a little more ooey gooey madness but it was still good.
