I usually have to make a lot more and add 1/3 more ingredients. The raisins make this recipe taste as if I used wine at least that's what my dinner guests tell me.",

If you follow the recipe as written it makes a LOT of dressing-- definitely more than will fit into a 2 quart baking dish (8x8) as the recipe calls for. I put it in a 9x13 pan an it was almost too much for that! I used a 16 oz package of Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix (right at 7 cups) and a little less butter (I poured some pan juices from my baked chicken over it) but otherwise followed the rest of the recipe pretty closely. The apple in it was very good and that's what my husband particularly enjoyed. Sunmaid now makes \"baking raisins\" which are already plumped up-- no need for soaking which was very convenient. I think if I try this again I'll make only half and will try to use plain bread cubes instead. It was good just not as yummy as I had hoped for.",
