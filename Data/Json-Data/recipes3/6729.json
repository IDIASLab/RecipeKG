The Real Carbonara is simply 1 whole egg gently beat and added to that 24-36 month aged parmagiano-reggiano until you acheive a thick consistency or how you prefer with a pinch of salt and a twist of fresh ground pepper and of course the smoked pancetta not cooked till its crisp.Then add to that your preffered pasta . We use Tagliatelle egg  pasta.  This is a true recipe from Parma, Italy. But I am sure the other is nice too but is not an original.",

I used this recipe instead of the other carbonaras because of the pancetta, which I think is a step up from regular bacon- especially in this dish.  The only changes I made were fyring the pancetta first and then cooking 1/2 an onion, 1 large shallot and 2 cloves of garlic in the drippings.  And I omitted the pine nuts just because I don't like nuts in savory-type foods and the salt, as pancetta and parmesan are salty enough already.  Thanks KMOMMYZ... good stuff :)",
