I did however make a couple of changes but the base recipe still deserves 5 stars. I added 1/4 cup of dry white wine 1 tbsp of lemon juice and 1 cup each diced Roma tomatoes and white mushrooms to the garlic for the first 5 minutes of cooking. I also added 1 bag of baby spinach leaves at the end with the parsley until it was just wilted. It was pretty to look at as well as delicious. My husband who is a certified carnivore actually enjoyed this and suggested maybe adding some cooked shrimp next time I make it. UPDATE I made this again last night with a few additional changes and it became an outstanding dinner!! I used the basic recipe. I added the baby spinach leaves mushrooms roma tomatoes 1/2 cup white wine and 1 tbsp lemon juice like I wrote last time I made it but last night I added diced cooked chicken black olives roasted red peppers onions some capers sun-dried tomatoes (drained) and pine nuts to the mix...What a HUGE difference!! It was already a great recipe but these few simple additions took it WAY over the top!! I sprinkled a handful of shredded Mozzarella cheese over top just before serving and served it with an artisan cheese bread and there wasn't a drop of leftovers!! Like the old Alka-Seltzer commercial said... \"I can't believe we ate the whole thing\"!!:)",
