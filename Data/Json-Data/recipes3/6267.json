When I went to fry the first batch, they disintegrated in the oil and were not salvagable.  I devised this fix: I added 1 beaten egg to the remaining mixture (I had enough remaing for about 2 dozen more balls) and baked the balls in a 400 degree oven on a well greased sheet pan with more oil lightly sprayed over the top of them.  They baked for about 30 minutes, and when cool, were just firm enough to stir into gravy.  The gravy, by the way, was outstanding on its own - would be great with paneer or chicken, too.  I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of paste.  Served with basmati rice and Naan(recipe from this website).",

So, I added about 4 oz. of tomato sauce and increased the milk to 1 cup.  I also added some white raisins to the \"gravy\" which really made it taste spectacular!  As for the kofta balls, I first diced up 1 1/2 potatoes into small cubes and cooked them until soft in lot's of Indian spices (such as tumeric, masala...).  Once the mashed potato mixture cooled, I beat one egg and rolled the potato balls into the egg and then I fried them.  They didn't fall apart at all this way!  It was very tasty made this way...",
