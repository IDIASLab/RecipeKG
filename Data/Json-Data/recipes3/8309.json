Next time, I will add flour to the mix and I think that will help prevent this problem and help the breading to not clump on the fish.  This recipe had nice flavor and walleye is a meaty fish, so my husband didn't have as much a problem with it as he sometimes does with other kinds of fish.",

After putting the first fillet through the pecan meal, the remaining meal turned into a goopy sludge and it was difficult to coat the other fillets.  It still tasted fantastic - just not very uniform or as appealing in appearance as it might have been.  I think next time I might try dipping the fillets in the egg mixture and then spooning the coating over each fillet.  Also wondering if it would be good with a coating of 2/3 pecan meal to 1/3 panko crumbs?  Pecans sure ain't cheap.",

I followed all the ingredients and steps, except that I used walnuts (I crushed them with a mortar) and then put almost the same amount in blanched almond flour (so about 60/40 of each).  Like some people said, if you use your fingers to take the fish dipped in egg to the flour, your fingers will get mushy and then the stuff doesn't stick to the fish as well, so perhaps use a fork to move the fish in the flour plate. I did also put much more oil in my pan so that it was about 1/4 inch high. The nutty flavor was fantastic and almost had a chicken nugget type feel. If I had kids that were difficult with fish I think they would be ALL OVER this stuff. Try it my way, you won't regret it!",
