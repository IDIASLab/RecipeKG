I grated my zucchini skin and all instead of chopping it & after I sprinkled it w/ salt I wrapped the zucchini in a few paper towels and squeezed out all the liquid over the sink...its MUCH faster than waiting for the liquid to drip out on its own in the fridge! I did the same thing to the artichokes. I had some hot salsa seasoning on hand so I used that instead and I skipped the hot sauce because the seasoning I have is super spicey! I think I doubled the amount of olives added a dash or two of garlic powder and I used mayo instead of sour cream (I was out) as well. This tasted good right after everything was mixed I'm sure it will only get better as it sits and the flavors blend... thanks for sharing!",

I found it in the area at the store where they sell other kinds of packet seasonings such as chili meatloaf taco etc. I added an extra dollop of sour cream (no reason I just felt like it) but other than that I made the recipe as is. I served it with a variety of crackers. If you prefer I'm sure this recipe could be lightened-up without affecting the taste by using reduced fat cream cheese and light or fat free sour cream.
