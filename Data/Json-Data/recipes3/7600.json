If the tuna and sauce combo weren't so good we would have tossed the whole thing. But since the dish is yummy we wound up picking the noodles out of it.",

I made it per the recipe and I agree with one other reviewer who said that the sauce should be doubled. My suggestions are: - Double the sauce recipe - Put sauce on the pan then add on top of the tuna mixture for each layer. - If you are feeling like more cheese add mozzarella cheese with the layers and add more cheese on top. - I prefer peas and corn for the vegetables and I usually have those frozen. - Bake covered for 35 minutes. Don't broil (it seems unnecessary in my opinion and is more to worry about).",

I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8\"x8\" dish cutting the lasagna noodles in half and fitting into the dish. Half a recipe would have been six servings but in this house it was four. The recipe doesn't say to add sauce between layers. I did put a little on each layer but it just wasn't enough. The minced garlic adds fantastic flavor to the sauce. Nutritionally this is a superstar and I know that adding more sauce will change those values a little but it also will take this from a four to a five star recipe. We liked it and I will make it again...with more sauce to make it creamier.",

As a casserole dish I rate this a 5 star recipe. I substituted 5 cups mafalda pasta (bite-size lasagna looking noodles) for lasagna noodles. I'm also allergic to egg white so omitted it but you wouldn't need the egg if making this into a casserole. I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the liquid and had no problem with dryness. I only had two cans of tuna but that was plenty. I mixed everything into the cream sauce except the crackers and Italian seasoning and then poured the cream mixture over the cooked pasta and combined before transferring everything to a 9x13 baking dish. I didn't have crackers to make a topping with so I topped it with a mixture of Panko and 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning instead. I baked as directed above but because I wasn't layering I saved all the cheese for topping at the end. Scrumptious!",
