I've used this SO many times and it is the BEST! I use regular Ranch dressing (not non-fat) more fresh basil (about 1/2 cup chopped) and fresh ground pepper to taste. I also pound the chicken first then marinate. The longer the better sometimes overnite but a few hours works as well. It is fork tender cooks quickly and does not get any easier than this. TRY IT!! For those that thought it was bland (?) try a pinch of cayenne possibly.:-)",
