It will fall flat and be gooey inside everytime with the wrong/butter mix.  Hope this helps ; )",

Sift the cake mix and pudding, in a separate bowl mix all the wet ingredients, then mix the wet in with the dry.  You can bake this cake in any type pan you desire.  I bake most my cakes (this one included) at 325.  This cake came out moist and delicious.  We frosted one layer with chocolate frosting (my daughter insisted) and left the other plain.  I prefer plain.  The frosting was too much sweet for my taste, however my 4 year old daughter wouldn't have it any other way.  Try it, you can't go wrong!",

Using a Duncan Hines Butter Fudge Cake Mix....I substituted some of the water with coffee(1/2 cup)then used 1/8 cup water and the 2 tsps vanilla. I gently folded in the sour cream just until blended. I put the batter in my NordicWare bundt pan and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. The result was perfectly formed cake, moist and good texture.
