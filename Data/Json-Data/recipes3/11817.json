I did use gluten free rotini because I coudnt find the elbows. The shape held onto the oil dressing nicely anyway. I cooked it until the softness I like. I used safflower oil for the olive oil as it is what I have 2 tblsp of lemon juice and no zest kosher salt and pepper 1 tsp of dried oregano for the fresh pearl sized mozzarella 10.5 oz pack of the yellow tomatoes quartered and a basic brown mustard without horseradish to keep it mild. This was easy to make and looked fresh. It would work well for a summer salad with other add-ins in particularly for those that cant eat wheat products. Note though as another mentioned it does soak up the dressing overnight. I would consider making extra dressing if re-serving the next day as leftovers.",

I highly recommend using a small lemon a large lemon would be too strong. The only changes I made was to not put the pasta on a baking sheet. I just put it in the mixing bowl after draining water off and rinsing it just a bit. Also I mixed the dressing in my blender. It would be a great dish for a potluck. The Barilla Gluten Free noodles tasted just like regular pasta and I couldn't tell the difference.",

I did add some cubed mild cheddar cheese garlic finely minced dried basil and a smidge of dried oregano. Next time I make this recipe I might try using a red wine vinaigrette because after refrigerating the pasta salad overnight the pasta was hard. I think it was due to using the olive oil.",
