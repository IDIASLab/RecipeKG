If you don't like a lot of \"heat\" I suggest you leave out the red pepper flakes or only use 1/4 tsp. I only made half of this recipe as there is only 2 of us eating and with 1/2 tsp we had the heat. We like heat so that did not bother us. I used Barilla Marinara for the sauce. We will make this again. You want to serve with a slice of bread for the \"heat\". My kitchen smelled wonderful while cooking. I did this meal in my wok that goes on top my stove. I did use olive oil for browning the chicken. Also it says just heat through after adding sauce I actually let it cook for about 15 min or so. I wanted all my flavors to meld. LEFTOVER IDEA.. MMMMM... I am thinking taking the sauce mixture with chicken and putting on sub bun with moz or bleu cheese and under broiler.. wow.. or in a tortilla for a wrap..",

I would recommend using two bottles of sauce if you use a thicker pasta. I used a vodka tomato sauce instead of a basic spaghetti. Next time I would only use 1 tablespoon of cajun seasoning because i thought using two made the chicken kind of salty.... Overall it was a really good recipe that you can tweak to your liking.",
