Per the optional instructions, I blended the mix into a fine powder (using a food processor). Freshly blending the dried herbs and spices in small batches makes for a wonderfully pungent and flavorful seasoning for just about anything. I considered making a large batch of it, but I like the idea of making the suggested amount as needed; it'll last about a week in our kitchen, and it's totally worth making a new batch every few days in order to get that \"just ground\" flavor.\n\nI used this recipe as a seasoning for grilled chicken breasts today, and the flavor was fantastic. I'm fairly confident we won't be buying the big \"C\" again any time soon. Thanks for a great recipe!",
