If you don't want it too hot, then definitely scale back on the jalapenos. I didn't have any Mexican tomatoes on hand, so I used the same amount of canned plain, diced tomatoes and added some garlic powder, chili powder and a little cumin to taste.\n\nDon't miss down in the footnotes that water may needed to be added. I missed that and ended up adding water after it had already been cooking for 45 minutes. Mine took about 1 1/2 cups of water ( I was making a double recipe) and took about 70 minutes or so to cook. It probably wouldn't have taken that long to cook if I had added the water at the beginning. It would be nice for the water to be in the recipe rather than in the footnotes.\n\nIt might seem like I barely followed the recipe, but when I added my spices, I was just trying to guess what Mexican tomatoes had in it. I must've guessed pretty close, because it really was good! Thanks for the submission :-)",

I wasn't sure what Mexican tomatoes were, and believe I used the right kind. It just kind of tasted like rice, tomatoes, and heat. The sour cream and cheddar, is definitely needed! It added flavor, a creaminess, and took away from a tad of the heat. I made only 1/2 recipe and found at 20 minutes on low it started to near burn on the bottom. I had to add some additional water which was optional.",

I ended up having to add about 1.5 cups of water total throughout the cooking process since it was taking longer than expected for the rice to cook, and to make up for the reduced liquid from the smaller cans of tomatoes.  The rice had a good amount of heat to it. If you don't like things spicy, definitely omit the jalape\u00f1os.  It was perfect for me and hubby though. I highly recommend the Mexican Lime & Cilantro flavored tomatoes. They lend a great flavor to the overall dish.  Make sure you eat it with sour cream and cheese. SO SO good! Also keep an eye on this once the water gets low because it burns easily! This one's a keeper!",
