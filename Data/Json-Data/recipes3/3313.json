I made a few revisions: I plumped the raisins in warm water before adding added chopped pecans and increased the cinnamon to a teaspoon. Next time I'll increase the other spices as well and try to use more applesauce and less oil. They are not too sweet a lot of carrot texture without a lot of muffin cakelike texture. DEFINITELY spray the muffin tin or liners the muffins tend to stick.",

Not too sweet and the longer they sit (so the flavors can meld) the better they get!! Love this recipe. Thanks Sara.",
