The possibilites are endless in terms of seasonings you can but on top - I've also kept it simple and light and just used butter spray! This is a great snack especially when you just want a little something to munch on... Definitely won't be going back to the pre-packaged stuff sorry Mr. Redenbacher!",

                "reviewBody": "Yes this is less expensive and healthier than the premade microwave popcorn bags and uses less oil than if popping on the stove. With this paper bag method you must be take care with the details & pay attention in order to get a good final product and for safety. This paper bag method is best for small batches only 1-2 servings. Use the brown paper lunch bags that come in a pack of 50-100 or so. Fold the 2 open ends together and over 2-3 times make two little vertical tears in the folded portion to create a small tab. Fold the tab over and this helps keep the bag closed. Watch the popping carefully the first few times till you get the hang of the amount of time needed the power of your microwave etc. Once the popping slows to near stop stop cooking immediately or it will burn or could start a fire. Some kernels will remain unpopped. Longer cooking may pop the rest but will burn some of the already-popped kernels so it is not recommended. Use caution when opening the finished bag as the hot steam can cause burns. Children should always be supervised by adults for this paper bag cooking method. I pour the popped corn into a bowl drizzle with oil sprinkle with salt and then mix around. Garlic olive oil and finely grated parmesan cheese is a tasty topping.",

Without any seasoning it taste like air-popped corn. I used a 10x5 brown bag and it was perfect. You have to be cautious when judging the time because you don't want to burn the popcorn that has already popped but you don't want too many \"old maids\" left behind. Every microwave is a little different but once you know your microwave's time it's a cinch!",
