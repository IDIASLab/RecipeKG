Do NOT overdo the thyme as I did. It gives the dish the signature flavor but overdone it will overpower. The prep time seemed to take a bit longer than 10 minutes but I have little experience paring apples and that took more time and I chose to cut the chicken breasts into bite-size chunks rather than use the whole breasts. The overall flavor is not spectacular but it is nice over rice and very different. Definitely worth a shake!",

Not wanting to waste the chicken breasts I coated them with a thin marinade of dijon and a touch of garlic flavored olive oil then cut them in strips over a big leafy romaine and spinach salad. I suppose the fact that they had chilled and combined nicely with the greens made this a better luncheon salad than it did a dinner. Thanks Isadore.",

I have prepared similar dishes from this site - chicken with peaches chicken with apricots and they both went over well so I thought I'd give this a try. Very easy to put together - and I think we'll be making it a LOT this fall when our apples are ready for picking. I would recommend seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking it - I have found that helps a lot of recipes (I think some writers think seasoning the meat is just a given and don't include it as a step but as a novice cook - I can tell you it wasn't something I had ever thought of doing w/o instruction until I met my husband who always does it at the start of a recipe) Great dish for fall - although just as tasty served with sweet peas and mashed potatoes in the spring too!",
