The changes I made was to leave out the mushrooms substitute cream of chicken instead of the mushroom soup (the BF hates 'shrooms) season the chicken before dicing and add 1 1/2 c. cooked rice to the mixture before baking. The rice made it a more filling meal. Next time I will cut the sliced water chestnuts into smaller pieces. They were a little big.",

Added 1/2 block of low fat cream cheese cut into small pieces and about 3/4 c. shredded cheddar cheese. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used low fat/low sodium cream of celery - taste was great. Also used low fat mayo. Will make this again soon.",
