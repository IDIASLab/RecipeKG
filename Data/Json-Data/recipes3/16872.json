The texture is not creamy and the finished product is not sweet at all....bittersweet in fact. I noticed that the Ghirardelli recipe for fudge on the inside wrapper of the chocolate baking bar has the same ingredients but only HALF the chocolate chips and one baking bar with the same 14 oz of sweetened condensed milk. That would probably be much better. I won t make this one again. Perhaps someone who loves bittersweet chocolate would enjoy it.",
