I don't know if it makes a huge difference but, after I egg/coated the fish, I let them rest for about 5-10min. before frying--I just think they set up better.  Served w/ tarter sauce.  ",

My 5 yr old thought i bought them from the store because they tasted like our favorite brand of frozen fish sticks! DH the fried fish snob complimented me on how crunchy they were even after they were reheated. Great recipe. Will make again.",
