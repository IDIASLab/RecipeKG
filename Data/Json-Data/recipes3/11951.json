Cheesy, subtly spicy, and bursting with nacho flavor--it rivals any store-bought nacho cheese sauce. Just be sure to save some aside for yourself! Serve warm immediately over or with tortilla chips, on tacos or burritos, or as any other dip.",

I know I hate reviews where they don't make the recipe per directions/ingredients, however I had forgotten to add the cream cheese and sour cream since I was going by memory..ugh. I really wanted to follow the ingredients. BUT, it still  tasted extraordinary without those two ingredients because the spices were so good! I did add a lot of milk which made it thinner so it's easier to pour over the chips (maybe the cream cheese and sour cream would've done just the same, but tasted more creamier?) . I loved the review of someone saying they added salsa to theirs instead of Rotel tomatoes because I, too, don't have Rotel handy, but I did have salsa! The salsa was really good in it. I just added a few tablespoons.  Very great recipe and next time I will do it the way it's written and I'm sure it will still taste 5-star worthy! :) Thanks for this recipe!",

If you use medium low heat and take your time with the steps, your patience will be rewarded. I\u2019ve made this several times, and I always use more milk, so maybe I just like a thinner sauce. The best batch I made I used three cheddar cheese shreds (white cheddar, yellow cheddar, and sharp cheddar mixed in one bag) , one can of hot Rotel and one can of mild Rotel because the grocery was out of Original Rotel. The spices are spot on. This makes a lot of sauce, so be prepared to share! It refrigerated and reheats well. I\u2019m glad I found this recipe.",
