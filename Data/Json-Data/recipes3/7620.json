Though it's not for the faint of heart; 1 tsp of chipotle powder made this a bit too spicy for my girlfriend. This recipe could be improved by some form of complimentary sauce. We attempted making a reduction of the marinade but it was again a bit too spicy for some. I personally loved the flavor and found the spiciness acceptable.",
