Without embellishment it fear it would not have been soup but rather a bland sloppy mess of zucchini meat and onion. I made sure to add the liquid from the can of tomatoes fresh chopped garlic and mushrooms. Most importantly I added additional herbs and spices. 1 teaspoon each dried tyme and parsley (fresh is better but double the amount) 1/2 teaspoon salt pepper to taste one can of beef broth and about 1/4 cup of water (broth and water actually made it a soup). Last but not least I added a half teaspoon of cumin. This really made the soup sing and gave it a backgroud flavor that wasn't over-powering.",

There is zero liquid in the ingredients, so if you want it to be soup, I\u2019d suggest adding at least one 32oz carton of broth and adjusting the seasonings. It should really be called Ground Beef & Zucchini Skillet or similar, and as such, it would be an ok recipe. It makes for a quick weeknight dinner that you can throw together and serve over rice or noodles, or just as is, as a meat & veggie bowl. This could benefit from other seasonings and maybe some minced garlic.",
