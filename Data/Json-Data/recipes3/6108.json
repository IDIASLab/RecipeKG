I left those out in favor of whole wheat seashell noodles. It was still pretty good though. And yes it does make a ton! Update: All it was missing was time. I had some for lunch today and it was unbelievable. The flavors really meld together well. My preschooler who refused to eat anymore after her two no-thank-you bites last night begged for her own bowl after tasting mine today. Her eyes got huge and she pronounced it delish. I do however wish I had stuck with my instincts and froze half of the batch. If you cook the starch (potatoes or noodles) separately the soup should freeze beautifully. Then just add noodles after you unthaw your soup. There is no way we can eat all of this before it spoils.",
