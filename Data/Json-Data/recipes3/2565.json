I give this 5 stars after these modifications: substitute 2/3 of the oil with apple sauce use 1/4 cup eggbeaters for every egg use low or no-fat yogurt use skim milk. This brings the fat% to less than 15% without hurting the flavor. Using whole wheat instead of all purpose flour will increase the fiber 3-fold and adds a robust flavor. I grind my own which means that it is fresh & chocked full of extra flavor & nutrients too. Whole wheat has fewer calories and more protein too. Addressing the comments of others we thought the cinnamon was not overpowering -- in fact I might add more next time. It only took minutes to prepare just the time to quickly peel an apple which is a breeze with the good peeler Santa brought me. And as far as knowing when to turn the pancakes give them a little shove with the spatula -- if they easily move around you can safely turn them. If they seem to be cooking too fast turn the heat down a little. I found that medium high but more towards medium than high was the best setting for me after making all of these changes.",

My ONLY complaint is that they were not as fluffy as other pancakes I've made before. Still I would make this again and I loved the way my house smelled from these! Thanks Bonnie!",
