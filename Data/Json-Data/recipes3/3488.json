Although first time trying I admit that I tweeked it a bit by adding a 1/3 cup more of sherry 1 1/2 cup milk 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and 2 cups Kraft finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Once butter is melted on low heat I found that by turning the heat up to med./low you must stir and watch carefully after adding the initial ingredients and before adding cheeses as the mixture will lump up terribly. Should this happen don't dump and start over simply stir a bit vigorously mashing out any lumps that have formed for about 5 min. once mixture is smooth again you can begin to add your cheeses and lower the heat some and continue to stir. I found that if you add too much cheese such as the cheddar it may be a bit too much taste wise but adding some extra milk not too much will get it just right. Poured it over some steamed broccoli and it was simply \"DELISH\"...Thanks So Much Glen. Can't wait to try it again!!!",
