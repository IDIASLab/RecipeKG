I was a little worried about this dish since we are not big mushroom people but it turned out awesome!!! Will definitely make it again and again!  We did do a couple things different:  1. Expensive cuts like sirloin not necessary- we used cube steak because that was what we had in the freezer. Turned out great!  2. We cut the steak into bit size piece vs the thin slices. Made it nice to cook and easier to eat. We also cooked the meat in the bacon fat and added a tbsp of butter at the end for flavor.   3. We chopped the mushrooms in a food processor. Made then into tiny pieces which is easier for non-mushroom lovers to eat. Had to add a little extra wine to the mix to cook.   4. Used penne pasta because it was smaller. The rigatoni at the store was huge.   A couple changes we will make next time:  1. Worcestershire sauce when cooking the meat. Just for a little extra flavor.   2. Add steamed broccoli to the oven mix for a veggie component.",

I made it as written except substitued fat free half-n-half for the cream (just what I had on hand) powdered ginger for fresh and too much mustard (accidentally). I also used proscuitto for the bacon which was a plus. Unfortunately the sauce would not properly combine. The butter was floating on top even after simmering for the full time and even after it baked in the oven. It was way too mustardy (my fault) and just seemed to have too many strong flavors for one dish. I think it could have been better if I made it exactly as written but still not a keeper for me.

I was not impressed. I followed the recipe exactly so not sure what happened...I thought it didn't have enough sauce for one thing...I might try it again though -my husband and youngest daughter both liked it. (Might just be personal taste? I love feta cheese but am not used to feta and steak...)",
