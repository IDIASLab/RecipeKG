I used fresh baby spinach that I sauted with a bit of onion and red pepper doubled amount of goat cheese added about 1/2C seasoned bread crumbs and one egg. I didn't add salt or pepper. The cheese is salty enough and I used 5 peppercorn goat cheese I bought at the Farmer's Market. It wasn't super easy to form the patties but I got the hang of it and was able to get 5. Put them on a cookie sheet and into the fridge for a couple of hours. Fantastic surprise of flavors. Very very good. UPDATE-I have found that it is important not to over cook the burgers in order for them to stay moist. I have also made them without an egg and I prefer the texture.",

Half of the burgers went into the freezer for another meal and the others I broiled in the oven.

Next time I will definitely add some grated onions cayenne pepper salt and maybe a splash of Worchestershire sauce. I enjoyed the moist texture of these burgers! I ate it without the bun and mdae sweet potoato oven-baked fries to go along with it. If I would have had time I would've topped with grilled onions no doubt. I had no trouble forming these into nice thick patties and I placed on a lightly greased baking pan lined with foil. I put them in the oven at 450 F for 10 minutes and then \"broiled\" at 500 F.. and they were perfect. Thank you for the recipe!",
