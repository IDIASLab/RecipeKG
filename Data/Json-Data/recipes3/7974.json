I was cooking chicken in the oven and put this in the oven also. They cooked for approx 40 min. covered and then under the broiler for about 5 or 6 min. They were still very raw and crunchy but the thing I objected to was how much water there was in the dish once I uncovered them. At least if it were pan sauteed they wouldn't have been swimming in liquid. Overall okay flavor but still missing something.",
