This is THE kind of food we like...traditional dishes with a slight twist not so overpowerful that it obscures the original flavor intended. In this case the crab flavor mixes wonderfully with the slighty more than subtle taste of ginger..and the aftertaste of the ginger lingers in your mouth. If you do not like ginger you will not like this recipe. If you like adventurous recipes you will like this. Be certain to use fresh ginger NOT ginger spice. The only other hint is to cut down on mayo just a bit. Otherwise the same old advice about not handling the cakes too much applies as they easily break apart. (I held the patty in one hand and used the other to cover it with egg then breading. Gets to be a mess but would rather have a mess than broken patties). Thanks Dakota for this WONDERFUL keeper!",

I used canned crabmeat. For me - that's fine. I used 3 cans once and 2 another time. They were slightly smaller and made only a few less. I got about a dozen hamburger sized cakes with 3 cans. GRATE The Ginger to maximize the flavor and omit chunks!! The big change is that I beat the eggs and added panko bread crumbs right into the mix. You can add even more bread crumbs to stretch the recipe a bit more without losing flavor. This keeps it together well and I think allows for the canned crabmeat better. Certainly easier to cook up. I don't usually leave feedback when I change up a recipe so much but I was hoping it might be found helpful. Now to find the sweet cream sauce that went with the original recipe I had!!",

I made a yogurt sauce with lime and more cilantro as my husband likes sauces. Also as I was dipping the cakes in the egg/bread crumb mixture I patted an ever so slight amount into the cake thus holding it together better. I also used french bagette for the crumbs and served the leftover cakes (it was just the two of us) on toasted bagette the next day for lunch. Fantastic recipe!!",
