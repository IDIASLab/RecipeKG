I put the feta and cream cheese in a food processor and added fresh spinach roasted red peppers garlic and basil to make a filling with which to stuff the chicken. To the pan I added about 3 T of extra virgin olive oil and 3 T of lemon juice. I wilted some fresh spinach added some feta and mixed it with a lemon rice and it was great. My dinner party guests raved over it and couldn't get enough of the \"lemon sauce\" for the chicken. If you are experienced with roux you could thicken the lemon-chicken stock after cooking and that would be great too.",

The only change I made was after brushing the rolled chicken with melted butter to sprinkle each piece with a mixture of bread crumbs and parmesian cheese. The little bit of cheese that oozed out during cooking time was excellent spooned on top of the chicken. I served this alongside gnocchi with browned sage butter sauce. Too good!",

I seasoned the chicken really well (I did what a lot of people have done and just made a \"pocket\" for the stuffing.) I put sliced mushrooms on top of the chicken, 1/2 lemon juiced over everything, poured some extra virgin olive oil over the top seasoned and popped in the oven for about 40 minutes. This was AWESOME over Linguini I poured the sauce that was in the bottom of my chicken dish over the pasta-PERFECT!!!",

I increased the baking time to 40 minutes to factor in the thicker pieces of chicken. We will definitely make this again and again!",
