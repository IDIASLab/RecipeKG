It's not the consistency I was hoping for when I think of cream cheese frosting. I added some more cream cheese, and that helped. Just keep in mind that this is very sugary - not butter or cheese based like many. \nIt would definitely be great for icing cinnamon rolls or drizzing over a bundt cake..but the texture just didn't work well for frosting an entire cake.",

At that point, it was plenty sweet enough and adding the rest of the juice would have made it too runny. It still needed more flavoring though, so I added another 1/2 teaspoon of zest. The yield was substantially shy of 3 cups, and I can't see leaving out the 1/2 cup of sugar affecting that outcome. Good to know if you are expecting or needing the full yield. I would make this again, but may try increasing the cream cheese and using orange juice concentrate instead of juice.",
