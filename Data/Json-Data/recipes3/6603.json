The taste in general is fantastic but there are two minor glitches--one is that by cooking the garlic in the oil first it tends to burn before the alligator is cooked all the way through if you have larger pieces. Also the sauce made from deglazing the pan with the white wine is fabulous but there's hardly any of it left. It is likely the perfect amount for a light dinner for two to feed a hungry family of three there just wasn't enough to go around--and let me assure you there should have been because it's delicious soaked into the rice once the alligator is all gone! Thanks for this one I'll definitely make it again next time I wind up with alligator meat!",

Gator was tender and I served it over rice. It was A to the awesome! Word of advice the original recipe won't make enough sauce and even my adjustments left me a little short so don't be afraid to go big on adding wine juice etc for your sauce.",
