As to the moistness, I added kernels of corn as a variation; I wonder if that was what might have helped with the moistness (others who have reviewed this recipe have also complained about the lack of moistness).  The honey on its own is definitely not enough to sweeten them...I was wishing I would have added sugar as well.  This was my first attempt at homemade corn muffins, and I must say, I will NOT use this recipe again. =[",
