This recipe has the potential for greatness but there are some changes necessary. \r\n#1 Reduce the breadcrumbs; I agree with one of the previous reviewers~ 2/3 cup is way too much, it absorbs all of the liquid. \r\n#2 Use a combination of cheese mixtures; Cheddar and American, Cheddar and Jack etc..it works! Last, feel free to use frozen cauliflower, if you like. I encourage the folks to give this recipe another try, it is a delicious way to get the family to eat \"white brocolli\".",

Without using any butter, I blend the parmesan, salt and pepper, then top with the bread crumbs and more parmesan.  Both ways make a great way to make cauliflower yummy!",

Maybe next time I ll add more bread crumbs and less butter. Also adding broccoli is an excellent idea it will give it better color too. It was a little overpowering to get a bite of just bread topping so instead of sprinkling the bread topping on top I ll mix it in with the cauliflower/broccoli in a bowl before adding to the casserole dish this way every bite of cauliflower also has the tasty topping. Also the casserole layer was too thin so next time I ll make a double batch thus it ll be a layer of cauliflower/broccoli with bread topping cheese sprinkled on top followed by a second layer of cauliflower/broccoli with bread topping finished with cheese on top. With these changes I think it ll be a hit at the office Christmas potluck. I can t wait!",
