My favorite Mediterranean place shut down and I have always wondered what spices they used for their meat and veggies. I made sauteed veggies (onions tomatoes and bell peppers). I took the reviewers' advice and didn't measure being careful to go very light on the cinnamon and nutmeg and I was amazed that it turned out just like the restaurant! I am giving this 4 stars because I haven't tried the exact recipe measurements. If I try the recipe quantities I'll update my review. UPDATE: I'm sorry but I have to bring my rating down. The quantities in this recipe are WAAAY off- the flavor exactly as TinHouston described it. Glad I only wasted an onion instead of adding it to the meat. The ingredients are good- just not the quantities. I can't remember exactly how much I put last time but I'd recommend equal portions of cumin & coriander (1 tsp each) salt and pepper to taste and just a pinch or max of 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon & nutmeg.",
