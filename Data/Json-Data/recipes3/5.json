I added some dried cranberries (and forgot to add pecans when taking the pic---but did add them before serving) and used a combo of blood orange and navel orange. I also only used about 3 tbsps of orange juice in the syrup. The one issue I had was that adding the marmalade to the cool syrup didn't work so well. The marmalade congealed, and didn't want to mix in--even after warming it up. So I strained that out, and would probably leave out the marmalade entirely as the syrup tasted fine without it. I would simply add some orange zest instead next time. I also sliced my apples, oranges, and bananas, then placed the dried fruits on top; and drizzled everything with the syrup. It was delicious! It's going to taste great with some Greek yogurt for breakfast tomorrow! Thank you for the recipe!",
