The stuff I bought was the crumbly kind so it behaved like ground beef but it was still great in our steakless cheesesteaks! I added some garlic powder to the whole mix. Quite tasty and only took about 25 start to finish. P.S. I'm a meat eater and served this to my meat eating family and it was a hit.",
