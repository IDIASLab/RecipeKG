                "reviewBody": "This dish came out light and fluffy and very tasty. However I am not sure crock pots are the best way for me to make egg casseroles. When eggs cook too long they water out and that is exactly what happened to mine. When I got home and checked the temperature of the center it was 190 degrees. When I bake egg casseroles in the oven I take them out when they reach 165 and never have trouble with watered out casseroles. Had I been home and caught this dish at the right temperature I feel confident there would have been no watering out. Now I must say I did not add the flour and I am \"guessing\" that may keep this recipe from getting watery in a crock pot. I just wasn't willing to put flour in my egg casserole. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the taste and texture of the dish. It was a winner recipe. Next time I will add some roasted red peppers to just give it added color. I do disagree with the 15 minute prep time. I assumed the contributor of the recipe meant for you to chop the spinach even though it was not mentioned. If you do that there is no way I can prepare this dish in 15 minutes. Plus I grate my own cheese since I do not like the ingredients that are added to pre-grated cheese to keep it from sticking together. I will continue to make this recipe but will prepare it in the oven. It was truly an amazing dish and I just loved the taste. It will make a great brunch recipe for company. If you don't mind using flour and the flour",

I had to get up early to turn It off. Don't let it cook to long or it will brown too much. I used fresh spinach I chopped up. I substituted gluten free flour for wheat flour. Also I had two extra eggs so I tossed them in also. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added turkey bacon and jimmy dean turkey sausage. That was my mistake. I will use Hillshire turkey kielbasa sausage next time. I don't think the ricotta made a difference.",
