I sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil drained and rinsed beans tossed in the beans and a can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings. Then I added the drained pasta (reserving a 1/4 cup pasta liquid) and tossed this all together. I sprinkled with a little extra olive oil parm cheese red pepper flakes and balsamic vinegar.

I sauteed the onion and then added about 7 or so cloves of minced garlic.  I added salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and basil before adding the tomatoes to bring out the spices.  I chopped one tomato and added two cans of tomatoes with garlic, basil, and onion and 2 cans of beans.  I used whole wheat elbow pasta although penne would have been perfect.  When the pasta was ready, I threw in a bag of baby spinach and shut the heat off.  I took about about 1/2 cup of the cooking water and added it to the beans.  Drained the pasta, threw it in the pot with the tomatoes and beans and combined.  Fantastic and although I doubled the recipe and added a few changes, it was a delicious vegetarian meal that even the meat eaters loved. ",
