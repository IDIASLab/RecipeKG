I'm always looking for a way to mask the gaminess of deer and this did it. I didn't have wine so I added a little vinegar. I also added several splashes of worchestersire sauce and fresh crushed garlic. Toward the end it mixed a little water and flour to thicken it. I will make it again. Thanks for sharing!",
