I poured  Ortega medium chunky salsa over top and light Mexican blend cheese (a bit more than called for). I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes since the chicken was uncooked. After it comes out of the oven I pretty it up a bit by topping it off with some sliced black olives and thin sliced green onions. The chicken is tender, juicy and delicious! It's great topped off with dollup of light sour cream - YUM!",
