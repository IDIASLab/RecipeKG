The cheese has to be added when the pot is simmering lightly or when turned off because if you have the pot boiling away you will get cheese goo!! The cheese melts best when it starts out at room temperature not cold. I always brown the sausage first in the soup pot and then the onion because it adds a layer of flavor. If there is too much grease for your taste after browning the sausage and onion you can remove it with a paper towel before the liquid is added. I also add a can of diced tomatoes with juice but that is because I like the combo of cabbage potatoes and tomatoes with the cheese. Thanks this is a great winter warmer-upper!!",

It was really tasty but still more watery than a chowder should be. I will use these ingredients again but maybe make a cheese sauce to add instead of the cheese alone.",

I made it with 2 boxes of low sodium chicken stock instead of water and filled the pot to an inch UNDER the veggies. They give off water as they cook so when I pulled the lid (oh yeah I cooked the first 15 minutes with it covered) the liquid was just right. I still added the boullion. I added 2 onions and 2 cloves of garlic. I too like the combo of tomato and cabbage so I threw in a can of diced stewed tomatoes with their juice - it could have used one more. I also added quite a bit of dry mustard as someone else suggested. I liked this recipe and with the adjustments I made I'd give it 4 of 5 stars. I heeded the advice of others who had issues getting the cheese melted in and made a sauce of sorts with the evaporated milk a little hot broth and the cheese and whisked like mad to get it to come together. it sorta did but not well. If I made this again which I will I'll probably saute the veggies first in some butter add flour to make a roux then add in the broth. The broth tasted good in it but it left me wanting it more creamy style rather than soupy.",
