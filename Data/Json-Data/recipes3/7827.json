With that being said please forgive my photo of this recipe. As far as the recipe goes it is delicious. I love the incorporation of the potatoes in this omelet. I used Egg Beaters (gotta watch that ol' cholesterol) and omitted the salt peas and raisins as I don't care for any of those things. Oh and I also used imitation crabmeat as that's what I had on hand. Thanks for the recipe lola.",
