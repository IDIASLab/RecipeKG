I will try and fry what I have left over and see if that improves the flavor.",

I did make one major substitution though...I used regular potatoes instead of sweet potatoes b/c that's what I had on hand and they worked great in this! Also I did not use 1/4 cup of lemon zest just the zest from 1 lemon. I served these w/ sour cream and we thought they were tasty. I think some onion in the mix would also be a great addition but not necessary. I fried mine. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I substituted kefir (smooth Turkish yogurt) for mayonnaise to cut down on fat content and as a result I got hash/stuffing instead of proper cakes...but it was DELICIOUS. I could only eat maybe 1/4 of the recipe because of how filling it is so I'm saving the rest back as a side with turkey or some other gamy meat.",
