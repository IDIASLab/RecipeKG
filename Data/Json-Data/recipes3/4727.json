I definitely recommend this recipe for anyone and it goes well with veggies potatoes stuffing or anything else you can dream up! Very filling!",

This was fantastic as a meat loaf and it's versatile too. Using a cookie scoop it also makes wonderful \"meat\" balls. Just bake them about 20 minutes and they're perfect. I put a couple on a hoagie roll with some marinara and parm and it makes a great meat(less)ball sub!",

Like the other fantastic reviewers noted the soup mix would've been too much so I used half a packet. Also used 2 pckgs Smart Ground from the fridge section instead of frozen. I've tried both and neither hold together. Also used sunflower oil instead of veg and added sauteed onion garlic and grn. pepper instead of powder. Glazed with 3/4 c ketchup 1tbsp mustard 1 tsp worsh. sauce 2tbsp brown sugar. I served on a bed of mashed red potatoes (5 potatoes boiled and mashed 1/2c mayo 1/2 c milk 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tsp salt) and a side of steamed carrots. Very hearty meal will definitely make again. I'd love suggestions on how to make it hold together better.",
