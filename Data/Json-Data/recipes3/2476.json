If it tastes like flour it means that the flour wasn't cooked off with the butter before the milk was added. Throw it out and go again, the temperatures of the mix once the milk is added are not high enough to cook the flour.  What I prefer to do is to melt the butter first and then add the flour - equal parts butter to flour by weight. Cooked off properly, this will not taste like flour.",
