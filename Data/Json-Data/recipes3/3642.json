I ALWAYS substitute boneless skinless chicken thighs in all recipes that call for chicken. I trim off most excess fat from the thighs. I used fat free half and half for the heavy cream and then just thickened the sauce with a LITTLE cornstarch.  Also, I prepared extra sauce to pour over the pasta when served. I think the sauce is best made THE NIGHT BEFORE so the flavors can blend through(it's also easier that way if you're potlucking at work as we often do). Keep the sauce and pasta separate until serving or the pasta soaks up too much of the sauce. I agree with many about bumping up the Pesto.  I make my own Pesto so it packs plenty of flavor punch. Fast, easy and not fussy to make.  A hit with the crowd.",

I always make my own pesto, as  I did this time, but this was the first time I've ever mixed it with cream and I was SO impressed that I probably will always make my pasta with pesto like this from now on. I also liked the fact that the recipe calls for a subtle amount of pesto and it was just right.  Too often I've experienced such a ton of pesto in dishes (restaurants, actually) that it is literally sickening. Not this time--and I think after this dish my husband has actually made friends with pesto!  ",
