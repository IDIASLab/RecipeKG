I'm about a 6 or 7 on a scale of 10 for spiciness and I actually added a little more Sriracha (personal taste preference). The Sriracha and honey work harmoniously in this recipe perfectly balancing each other and the garlic gives it a good zing. Served today on some toasted garlic crostini I had left from yesterday but I'm thinking of all kinds of food to partner with this butter. Very nice recipe.",
