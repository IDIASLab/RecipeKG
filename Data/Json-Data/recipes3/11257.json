It definitely wasn't - the cheese melted into an oily mess that tasted ok but looked unappealing. In general, substituting a soft cheese for the pecorino is probably a bad idea.\nAside from that, I sauteed 4 shallots and 4 cloves of garlic, and added them to the sauce with a few teaspoons of truffle oil. Those modifications were really necessary, because even after all that, it was still pretty bland. Next time I'd add more garlic/shallots, definitely pre-order the correct cheese,  and probably double or triple the cayenne and nutmeg. Rating it 4 stars because the bones of the recipe are good and can tolerate a lot of modification.",
