More like 45 mins. \n\nEveryone likes the way I make mine so no complaints here! ",

It just took a few minutes to put it together and I already had all the ingredients on hand. It was so simple but tasted wonderful. Exactly what I was looking for. The only change I made was not to top it of with onions at the end. I didn't want the onions to overpower the green beans. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It will become a favorite in our house.",
