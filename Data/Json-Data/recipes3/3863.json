I made the dressing following the recipe exactly and would do so again. For the salad itself I would have appreciated the addition of corn which I had intended to do and forgot. I used shredded Cheddar cheese rather than the Parmesan because I felt it was a better match for this salad. Instead of crushed or whole tortilla chips I used tortilla strips specifically made for soups and salads. This salad has all the Southwest flavors I enjoy right in one bowl. It's colorful crunchy festive refreshing nutritious and delicious.",

I only used half the black beans. The biggest change that I did was that I made double the amount of salad dressing and I used half of it to marinate the chicken tenderloins for approx. 1 hour.  This really made them so tasty and I believe added to the overall flavor of the salad.  I will definitely make this again.",

I also added a little garlic salt to the dressing. I seasoned a couple of thin chicken breasts with garlic salt chile powder and cumin. I baked it for 20 min. at 350. I cut the chicken into slices and it was sooo good. The flavor went perfect with the salad. I left out the tortilla chips and cheese to make it healthier. My husband kept raving about it too. It's a keeper! Thank you for the great recipe!!!",
