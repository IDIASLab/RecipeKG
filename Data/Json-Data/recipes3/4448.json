I was so tired of the same old \"gambotto\" (zucchini with onions, tomato sauce and sausage), so I searched to find something different. I found this recipe and tried it. My family loved it. We ate the entire pan in one night. I did change one thing: I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and not white plain and I baked it in a baking pan so the batter was a little thinner than if I used a casserole dish.  I also shredded prosciotto over the top and that made it a little extra special. (add about 5 - 10 min before it's done). I made it another time with pepperoni on top, which was added about 5 minutes before it was done.\nNow that the season is over, my family actually had me BUY zucchini just so I could make it again.",

I havent' used the fresh Parm before and Jean you are sooo right.  It makes a difference. When dieting this is a \"go to\".  I just use Eggbeaters, less Parm and spray pan with Pam.

I have made it a couple of times since tweaking it to my personal tastes. When I made it by the recipe I don't know if I didn't extract enough moisture from the zucchini after cooking it or if I did something else a little wrong but the end result while tasty was much more souffle like than appears to be the case in the photo on the recipe. It still tasted good but as others have mentioned it is fairly bland for my taste. Easy fix - add some jalepeno peppers. I quartered then thinly sliced my Zucchini. I halved seeded and thinly sliced the jalepenos. Rather than boil the squash I sauteed everything; onions and garlic first followed by peppers then zucchini. My most recent modification is to add a little cumin to the spice mix. I can't agree more with the recommendation of using freshly grated cheese. Bottom line is I find this recipe a great starting point to which you may add ingredients or spices to suit your personal preferences. Wow I just had a thought... what about some halved cherry tomatoes? Or maybe some halved black olives? Now I have to make it again soon just to see.",
