I did use the recommended 1c. vegetable broth (from cube); I mixed the curry powder and 1 tsp ground cayenne (our family loves spicy food!) into the broth along with two T whole-wheat flour to help thicken it back up a smidge; might should have used cornstarch instead. Stirred the broth in with the tomatoes (I used canned diced... much easier). Served over steamed basmati rice with naan (gotta have those carbs). Was even better next day reheated... flavors merged nicely. Thanks very much!!!!!",
