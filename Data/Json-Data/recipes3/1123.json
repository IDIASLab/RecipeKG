I had it on hand; 2. slightly lower sodium content), and I could only find a 16 oz bag of coleslaw mix so I added the whole thing. Otherwise, to the letter on this recipe. I served it with cauliflower rice and sauteed mushrooms. Sprinkled a few sesame seeds on top. Heaven! It went together very quickly. Holds well in the refrigerator.  My mind is whirling with ideas on how many different ways I can serve this - over cauliflower rice with a poached egg, in lettuce cups, in coconut wraps, over zoodles, a little egg and some almond flour for binder then cook them up in patties....oh my! Go make this. Thank you Chez Gnar.",

Trust me, if you have 5 extra minutes, shred your own cabbage! It's cheaper per ounce and the texture was almost buttery but still had crunch!
