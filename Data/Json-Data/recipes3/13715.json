Since I didn't have poppy seeds and all purpose flour on hand substitutions included 1 c buckwheat flour instead of whole wheat flour; 2 teaspoons of cardamom seeds instead of poppy seeds; and added 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom powder after reading a recipe blog about a banana bread paleo recipe which incorporated cardamom. Next time will try adding the optional blueberries since the cardamom spice jar recommends using cardamom in blueberry muffin recipes.",
