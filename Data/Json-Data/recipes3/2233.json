However I agree with other reviewers that the dough was super sticky. I could not roll out the dough no matter how much extra flour I used. I ended up dropping the dough by pinched handfuls into the boiling broth. They turned out excellent and full of flavor! Hint: If you don't like extremely doughy/thick dumplings you need to pinch off very small amounts of dough to drop into the broth.",

I have tried many other recipes and this one is the best!  The dumplings have an awesome flavor and consistency and they definitely made an excellent pot of chicken and dumplings.  They are meant to be rolled out flat but you will have to use a lot of flour for dusting the dough as you roll them out avoid having the dough stick to your roller. I then used a pizza cutter to cut them into squares rather then circles, I find that to be much easier.  Thank you so much for a recipe that my entire family loved so much. There were none leftover!!",
