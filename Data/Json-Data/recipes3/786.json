The filling was light I'll give you that but it was also quite runny. HOWEVER... I did not give up on this recipe. Instead I played with it a bit and prefected it. for a 5-star filling omit the milk and use only whipping cream. This way it still stays light but is thick enough to work with. The modified version is amazing in cream puffs! Thanks Kit for the recipe!",

If I wanted to end up with something that tasted exactly like whipped cream I would have just whipped the heavy cream and had done with it with less trouble than this recipe. Final product was was very very soft light in texture and delicate. It didn't stand up very well to the 3-hour delay between filling eclairs and serving them.",
