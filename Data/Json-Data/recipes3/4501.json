I prepare it with the following changes: use a 15 oz. can of diced basil seasoned tomatoes (not drained) instead of the fresh tomatoes, use the entire package of basil feta cheese, stir approx. 5 oz. of shredded asiago cheese into the pasta prior to mixing with chicken.  DO NOT CUT THE PASTA IN HALF as other reviewers have suggested. This spaghetti isn't super saucy and liquidy like many Americans expect and that could be why people suggested using less pasta. The asiago cheese adds texture and flavor to the pasta.  If you use the amount of pasta called for, this meal will go a long way.  Enjoy!",

I didn't even know it had been posted until I \"googled\" my name the other day (just curious, ya know?!?!)  Anyway, having read through the reviews and suggestions, I would like to make a few clarifications to the recipe.  I always use Paul Prudhomme's blackened redfish magic, and I realize now that I usually only use 1/2 to 2/3 box of angel hair pasta.  Hope that helps, and thanks again for the good reviews.  Enjoy!\r\nPS:  I didn't know how to post notes to your own recipe, hence posting here in reviews.\r\nThanks again, \r\nMolly",

I'm married now and still making it- even my husband who is somewhat choosy about food loves it and actually requests that I make it. I will say that it is much better with the freshest tomatoes you can get... during the winter tomatoes from the store can be a bit bland and because tomatoes are a huge part of this recipe the dish will be a bit bland because of it. So I think it's best during the summer with fresh farmer's market or your own garden-grown tomatoes (which are tangier and more flavorful than anything you'll buy in the store) or canned diced tomatoes with plenty of Italian herbs in them. All else being equal though the fresh tomatoes will taste better and have less sodium than canned. Try this recipe!",
