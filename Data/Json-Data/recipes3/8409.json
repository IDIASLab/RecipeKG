It reminded me of a can of diced tomatoes (even tho' I did use fresh) with a boatload of herbs added. That's it... tomatoes and herbs. Moreover I just didn't see topping this with gorgonzola and adding the cinnamon wasn't even a viable option. Gorgonzola and cinnamon? Three stars I say - and that's withOUT the cinnamon and gorgonzola. At least Hubs agreed with me on that much anyway - no way was I going to serve him a bowl of soup with cinnamon and gorgonzola in it. \"Thank you \" he said. But he LOVED the soup rating it 4 stars which for anyone else would mean 5. He said that most often tomato soups are pureed and include cream; that this was interesting and different for its chunkiness and herbiness. In the end it doesn't matter what it's rated really. It's a matter of description and individual tastes pure and simple.",

                "reviewBody": "Delicious. Passed it on to my mom right away. Notes: I halved a large sweet onion and sliced it thinly with the grain so it would stay together better during carmalization. I'd say I took the caramalization level to medium 20 minutes. I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes plus one large fresh tomato roughly chopped with skin on to add some brightness and texture. We don't mind a little skin in our soup and its faster. The cloves of garlic I used were very large prob. closer to three regular sized. I used sweet vermouth because I prefer it. I omitted the fresh oregano as I didn't have any on hand. I tried the soup at this point and it was already good but it was the combination of cinnamon and Gorgonzola that drew me to this recipe in the first place. I love this combo with pears and red wine in risotto. My cinnamon is a particularly sweet variety so I used 1/8 tsp and stirred it into the soup after the cooking was done. I added Gorgonzola to the individual bowls prior to serving. The cinnamon added a subtle complexity and aroma that were just lovely and complemented the salty nutty cheese beautifully. My husband who doesnt like tomato soup said this one was great. Thank you for this recipe.",
