Baked at 350 for 40 minutes on a broiler pan then switched it to a shallow dish and poured extra sauce over it( I made two seperate batches of the marinade). I used more chipotle peppers than just three ( the whole can between the two batches of sauce that I made) because I love Spicy. I was very happy with the way the chicken turned out!!! Thank you!!!",

Perfect heat in the background that you know it is there. I usually look at a recipe and change it. The only thing I changed was the chicken. I used skin-on-thighs and marinated overnight. I cooked indirect with a pecan chunk for a little smoke for 1hr 15 minutes at about 350 degrees. Very good marinade for sure. Even for the people that don't like \"spicy\" food this a great recipe! I will be doing this one again!",

What remained was a flavorful tender piece of chicken excellent served alongside \"G-ma's Rice\" recipe from here. The only difference that I did was using boneless breasts instead of drumsticks and bottled lime juice (I know! I would much rather of squeezed fresh but it's all that I had on hand!) but this was an absolutely delicious marinade that I am anxious to try again.",
