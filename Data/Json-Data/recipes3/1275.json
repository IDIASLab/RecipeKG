I recently hosted a NOLA themed luncheon and served these as the cocktail. It was a huge hit. Be forewarned! It does pack a huge punch with the final product being about 50 proof (as much liquor as a straight shot of most whiskeys). I've made this as directed with great results and I suggest trying it that way first before changing the recipe to taste. I've also though made a few alterations to taste (and liquor availability). Adding an additional part orange juice doesn't change the taste that much. I've also substituted raspberry schnapps for Chambord when it was out in my local store with no taste change. If you want to make a big batch as I did for a get together it does keep very well pre-mixed in a sealed container in the refrigerator for about two days.",
