I had my doubts, given there was no sour cream in the recipe, but the higher proportion of buttermilk to mayonnaise took care of that.  As for the mayonnaise,  these type dressings do need it, but what I so appreciated in this recipe was that it did not  dominate as I\u2019ve found it does in some recipes I\u2019ve tried.  The recipe lends itself well to improvisation with any number of fresh herbs \u2013 in this case I used parsley, basil, and tarragon, already growing fresh in my Wisconsin garden.  Dill would have been a nice choice too.  Fresh thyme and/or oregano might also be interesting additions for a bolder taste. (I don\u2019t think Hubs or I would have cared for the cilantro but that\u2019s just our preference, I\u2019m sure)  The fresh garlic was apparent and I loved it \u2013 so much better than garlic powder, tho\u2019 that would certainly work in a pinch. Great dressing Michellejo3 \u2013 we\u2019ll use it often.",

I'm used to ranch dressing recipes that call for a mix of mayo, buttermilk, and sour cream but this was a pleasant surprise as I didn't have any sour cream on hand.  I opted for low fat buttermilk and Hellman's light mayo - I think any mayo you use would be fine.  I also subbed dill for the cilantro and wow - perfect over mixed greens!",
