For one thing green chile and feta cheese are really not terribly good together. I substituted a combination of bleu cheese sharp cheddar and parmegiano-reggiano with some sundried tomatoes and essentially followed the recipe as is. Like I said it was pretty good and with a few more tweaks could be excellent. Trust me though feta cheese and green chile are a very strange-tasting combination and the resulting aftertaste may put you off which would be a shame because this is a very good basic recipe.",
