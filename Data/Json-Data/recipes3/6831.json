I just threw my snap peas in with the pasta for the last minute of cooking and then did the cheese sauce in the pasta pot while the pasta was draining - saved myself some dishes... The sauce was way too thick for me so I did add quite a bit more cream- then I added a little gorgonzola to the top since it had weakened a bit. Even the kids both liked it. Thanks for the recipe!",
