It is difficult to form the crescent roll triangles into a circle (since they are canned together in a rectanglar shape) so I used a 13x9x.5 cookie sheet.  The first time I made it on a flat pizza sheet, and the edge of my crust was not sealed well enough and I had egg leak all over the bottom of my oven.  This time, the cookie sheet had just enough of a short edge to give support to the crust.  Additionally, I baked this at 350 (vs. 375) for 20-25 mins so that my egg will bake without my crust burning (which was my first trial mishap).  Third time is a charm and this was great.  I used sausage, onion (skilleted both with garlic powder and tabasco), then topped with the cheeses, sliced mushrooms, and thin sliced tomatoes.  Very easy.",

I didn't want to overcook the crust so I ended up just putting the pizza in the microwave for about 20 seconds. Very good and hardy.",
