There's no way you need 4 cups of chicken broth...that's why some people's came out \"soupy\". Really, one can (or 2 cups) is all you need. You need to be familiar with the right consistency of stuffing for in and out of the bird to not make that mistake. Anyway, I thought it tasted delicious WITHOUT the marjoram..not the right spice for this. Also, FYI, twelve cups of bread cubes should be about 1 large loaf of white bread cut into cubes. That should help some people get it right. It's the perfect stuffing for a chicken because I can never get enough into a small chicken for us! ",

Here's a way to save more: I just used a bag of Pepperidge Farm \"Sage & Onion\" stuffing, which allows me to skip the spice ingrediants. Ofcourse, I used fresh mushrooms to the celery/onion saute and  I also browned and drained 1 lb pork sausage & added that in!  In the words of Rachel Ray: YUMMO!! This recipe works great almost year-round. I will NEVER make traditional stuffing again! Thanks a ton!",

When you are mixing in  the broth into the mixture .... the stuffing should NOT be too  moist because the slow cooker will bring out the juices and make it soupy.  Also if you have a black crock pot do not  put it on high for 45 minutes.....just do it on low  because  the outside will be very crisp and stick to the sides and even with PAM it is a pain to clean up.  Just check the stuffing after a few hours to make sure it isn't too soggy.  If you see that it is getting soggy just remove the cover and let the excess moisture evaporate.  If that doesn't work ..you can stick it in the oven at about 200 for 10 or 15 minutes and you will have great stuffing.",
