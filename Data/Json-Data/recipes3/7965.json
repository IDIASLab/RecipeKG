The soup is made with a variety of fresh spring produce and ground veal. If you can't find the fresh ingredients or don't feel like shucking peas you can use them frozen. If you want to make a vegetarian dish, omit the veal and pancetta and replace the meat broth with a vegetable broth.",

It sounded very interesting and I had everything on hand except for the fresh thyme. I halved the recipe made it as is and it has a lot of interesting flavors going on and is a very filling soup. My personal preferences: I found the beef broth too heavy for all the spring veggies. When I make it again I will try it with chicken or veggie stock and switch out the veal for ground chicken. Definitely worth trying!",
