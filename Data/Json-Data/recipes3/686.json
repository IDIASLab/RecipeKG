I used almond extract instead of vanilla and I used and about 1/2 the pecans it called for and the other half were almonds (in which I toasted both before crushing them.) I crushed them to a sandy texture for better flavor. Through trial and error, I discovered that the balls should be about the width of a nickel, no bigger than a quarter, for them to bake for 10 min. I tried larger ones, baked them longer, but I couldn't get them to bake evenly. Be sure that they are completely cool before rolling them in the sugar!",

I've had them with chunky nuts and with finely ground nuts, and I have to say the finely ground nuts are the way to go. \n\nAlso, since these cookies easily come together in a ball shape, we've put toffee, butterscotch, and sometimes chocolate in the middle. All you need to do is take three or four chips (of whatever you prefer), flatten out the cookie in your hand, place the chips in the middle, and fold the dough over into a ball shape and bake.

I reckon, 100g of walnuts is more than sufficient- too much nuts will result in the cookie breaking up more easily. Use lightly salted butter n omit the confectionary sugar in the batter. The mildly salted cookie and confectionary sugar coating is a perfect marriage of flavours! The trick to making these cookies melt in ur mouth is to avoid overbeating it and handling it as little as possible. After beating the butter (make sure it's not too soft, rather, slightly firm) with vanilla, add in the flour n beat till just blended/mixture forms a lump. Very easy and addictive!",
