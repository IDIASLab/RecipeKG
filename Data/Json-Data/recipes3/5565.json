I pressured cooked the chicken breasts and used my favorite chicken soup spices sage bay leaf thyme rosemary etc. I used regular barley instead of quick cooking because I like the firmer texture. I had never put almonds in a soup before so I was anxious to try it. They were ok but didn't have a \"wow\" factor so I won't add them again. I also had parsnips and lentils on hand so I put those in as well. It turned out to be a hearty comfort soup. I will continue to keep making variations of this recipe. So because of my personal preference I am giving this a 3.5 star rating. Go ahead and alter it to your tastes and ideas. Others love it exactly the way it is written but the possibilities are limiitless.",
