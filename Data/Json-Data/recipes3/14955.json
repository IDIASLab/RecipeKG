They are as versatile as traditional pancakes and can be dressed up or down as the meal requires. My favorite is to serve them with a pineapple-coconut-macadamia nut relish, but they're just as good served traditionally with butter and syrup (agave nectar is a great syrup). Maybe add a dollop of whipped cream on each stack.",

I ended up adding an extra cup of milk and it still wouldn't spread at all . . . so I'm standing there trying to spread out the pancake playdough and then when I try to flip it of course it falls apart. The basic idea of milk, butter, eggs, coconut flour and rice flour might still work, but this one didn't work for me.",
