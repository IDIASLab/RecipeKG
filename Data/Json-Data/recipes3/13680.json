Cauliflower is not a bold-flavor veggie, so I wasn\u2019t surprised when I found the soup\u2019s flavor a bit weak, so I did add more cheese and more salt and pepper.  I used the slow cook feature on my Instant Pot\u00ae and was happy with the way this recipe turned out.  And it is indeed easy to make, a definite plus!",

I made a split between chicken broth and veggie broth, both low sodium, so I could control the sea salt I added.  I added about 8 grinds of sea salt.  I added 10 grinds of black pepper.  I also added a nice yellow curry powder and smoked paprika, both 1 tablespoon each.  I used 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar for more flavor too.  I also like using the immersion blender, as I think it makes for easier clean up and a smoother and more controlled blend.",
