I added some canned diced potatoes about 1/2 tsp turmeric 1/2 tsp cinnamon and I didn't have any coconut. Also I used canned diced tomatoes because I didn't have any whole tomatoes. Still really good. For my kids I added some sour cream just to their individual portions just to mellow out the taste. It added a nice creaminess and my kids loved it. served over white rice.
