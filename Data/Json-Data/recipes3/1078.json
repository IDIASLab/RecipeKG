The only thing I did differently from the instructions was to leave out the black olives an ingredient I don't usually have on hand. I should have used my green stuffed olives. I chose to put this over capellini rather than the suggested couscous. Be sure not to overcook the chicken. Mine cooked quickly and I had to remove it to finish off the sauce. This is a nice meal that was satisfying. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
