This was good and I really enjoyed all of the fresh veggies but it was in need of herbs in my opinion. Maybe some oregano thyme or parsley? I absolutely love cilantro and very much enjoyed it as a garnish to this soup but I'm not sure everyone would agree with me on this. If you're not a big fan of cilantro I suggest replacing it with fresh parsley instead. All in all this was a good soup but I would add some herbs or maybe even a bay leaf if I were to make it again.",
