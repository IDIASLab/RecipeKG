They are traditionally handmade by rolling out potato dough on a board and cutting the dough into noodles. Simple and easy to make, they are delicious and go well with almost anything: roast pork, racks of lamb, bits of bacon, sauerkraut, and any cabbage dishes.",

Then, your input of flour will be lower and result in fluffier nudeln. Be careful of overmixing and/or adding too much flour you'll end up with gloppy, dense noodles. Also, a restaurant trick is to bake the potatoes in the oven, and it's very important to mix the egg in while the potatoes are still warm, otherwise the albumen won't react with the starch and it'll be harder to get a good quality nudeln",

I cooked the potatoes with the skin on peeled them after they had cooled slightly and added the other ingredients (just a 1/2 cup of flour) just as the recipe says and my dough was fine. If you keep the skins on while cooking it keeps the water out and you'll only need that 1/2 cup of flour otherwise they get soggy and then it's necessary to use more.",

The directions for the recipe do not work! I'd highly recommend peeling the potatoes before cooking as I lost half to the trash trying to peel soft potatoes! Also the amount of flour suggested is bogus! For 6 servings it said 1/4 cup. I needed to add 2 cups before my potato mixture would even roll out on a heavily floured surface. Tasted good but didn't get very good \"noodle\" shapes due to low flour content. I'd recommend upping the flour. My grandmother made these for years and never gave a recipe before getting Alzheimer's.",

Like others I had to add more flour to get it to a texture to roll out. Probably 1 1/2 cups or more. Since I don't like things very bland I added just a touch of garlic powder and paprika and thought that enhanced the taste. Other recipes had mentioned dropping the noodles in boiling salted water for about one minute (until they float to the top). I did this lifting them out with a slotted spoon and draining them before putting them in the skillet to fry. I made these with seasoned saurkraut and chopped bacon and onions (like in Germany). My husband and I really enjoyed it. I had a lot of the uncooked noodles left over so I put them on a cookie sheet and froze them then put them in a plastic bag for another meal. Don't know yet how that will work out.",
