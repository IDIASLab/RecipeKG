And I did finish the dish at the end with a couple of good swirls of butter to enrich the sauce, making it all luxurious and velvety. This has all the flavor you'd expect from a braised meat, yet it takes a fraction of the time.  The combination of the balsamic vinegar, Dijon and Herbs de Provence obviously work together to create something pretty extraordinary.  I served this tonight with Parmesan Garlic Orzo (tho' it was a toss up with just a pasta with garlic and olive oil) and fresh green beans sauteed with red bell peppers. It was a beautiful plate and a truly delicious meal.  (Note: Don't have provolone?  No worries!  Any good, semi-soft cheese will work just fine!)",

I did not have a large shallot so I subbed with half of a medium sized red onion and grated it. I also marinaded the chicken for about 6 hours. This really intensified the Dijon mustard and balsamic vinegar flavors. I would not recommend the faint of heart cooks to do this as the flavors were bold. A nice change from the usual delicate French tastes.Thank you!",
