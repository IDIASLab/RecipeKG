I froze the burgers not eaten for use later.\r\n\r\nI had no problem with these burgers falling apart.  The problem with the original receipe is too much moisture (potatoes have a lot of water), the amount of the additional ingredients prevents the beans from holding the burger together,  and no binding agent other than the eggs.  Substitute bread crumbs if you don't want to use oatmeal. \r\n\r\nThis made 6 burgers instead of 8",
