Afterwards he said I would definitely need to make this again, as he had four helpings. When I told him that it was goat cheese all he could say was 'REALLY?' and kept eating. I would say this was a winner; how about you? Just pour finished sauce over your choice of pasta, potatoes, or whatever you like.",

I added more milk and pureed the sauce to smooth.. much better although i didnt have any more goat cheese so that flavor was diluted by the additional milk. I posted two photos.. one with the thicker sauce and one with much more milk and pureed. I realize the recipe says milk too taste but doubling the milk is way more of adjustment and also results in less goat cheese flavor..",
