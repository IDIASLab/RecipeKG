The worst problem was that after a day the ritz crackers took up moisture from the caramel sauce (which never hardened and was always gooey) so they were no longer nice and crisp. My friend made these a few years ago and I thought they were great. She must have used different ingredients!",

And I tried to be very careful to not make a mess. They are very tasty though with the salt from the crackers & the pecans mixed with the sweet choclate & caramel---yum! I'll probably make these only when I want something kind of special for a party good finger food--but kind of sticky around the edges.",

The carametl never seemed to set all the way and when I tried to use the tongs to dip the crackers in the chocolate it was a big mess! Instead what I did was just spoon the chocolate over the caramel on the top. I think it worked out perfect that way because then the chocolate hardened over the caramel. No more messy caramel! I think it was a lot easier and less messy than using tongs! Everyone loved these!",
