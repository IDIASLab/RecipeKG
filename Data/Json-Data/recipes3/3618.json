When I checked the taste and consistancy after 2 cups of sugar and about 1 tbsp of milk it was perfect. The frosting wasn't too sweet which is the way we like it. I suspect 3 cups of sugar would make the frosting very sweet which you may need when baking for kids. But here we are not too fond of extra sweetness so I stopped with 2 cups. I also added about a cup of chopped nuts which made the frosting extra special. I didn't add any vanila but added another tsp of instant coffee. The coffee taste was perfect and not at all overpowering which I was apprehensive about. I used this frosting with a coffee cake and the end result was fabulous. Will def be making this again probably with a chocolate cake the next time. Btw this recipe is not enough if you want to fill as well as frost a cake. I just frosted and it was just sufficient.",

Thanks to all the other reviewers for the suggestion! I don't keep instant coffee on hand so when I brewed the very strong coffee for the cake I brewed a little extra and used about 2/3 milk and 1/3 coffee where the recipe called for milk. I definitely think that if you are having trouble reaching the desired consistency do NOT keep dumping in powdered sugar as it really takes away from the buttery cinnamon flavor that's to die for. Instead I suggest using a minimal amount of liquid to get started and add more if needed. My next use of this recipe will be to top my homemade cinnamon rolls! (At hubby's request) Thanks so much for an awesome recipe! --since then have made it a couple time the right way...wow!! I actually now use more coffee granules for an extra flavor boost and a splash of butter flavoring if the consistency comes out funky and I have to add extra sugar (weird how that happens sometimes!!) and it's a definite family favorite!!",

First I wasn't spending 4 on instant coffee for one teaspoon I am on a budget here. So I took a measuring cup and put one part milk one part REALLY strong brewed coffee and a big spoonful of sour cream. I wanted the consistency to hold up as my first batch wasn't stiff enough so I did add some shortening. 1tbs Cinnamon 1tsp 100% maple syrup 2tbs Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa powder teeny tiny splash of vanilla extract and rum. Fabulous texture consistency and the flavor was amazing! If your frosting is too thin try using some Crisco.",
