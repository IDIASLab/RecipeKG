I used Moscato wine (dessert wine) which brought out a very unpleasant sour/pickled taste in the fennel - assuming this is my fault for not heeding \"DRY white wine\". Goat cheese and herbs go well with both the fennel and wine. Took off 1/2 star for not listing the size of the baking dish or explaining \"arrange fennel\". I used an 8x8 dish for 3 regular-size fennel bulbs (sliced) I have never seen baby-size in any store; the slices were layered like a gratin. Another 1/2 star off for the excessive liquid - the end result was submerged. I will make this again but will try replacing the liquid with 1/2C of the water used from boiling (to increase the fennel taste) and 1/2C of Sauvignon Blanc.",
