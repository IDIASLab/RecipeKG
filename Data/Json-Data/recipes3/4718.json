The only reason I didn't give it FIVE stars was because I was swearing I'd never make it again when I was in the browning-the-chicken step. That oil pops like crazy and the pressure cooker is deep so you have to get your hand down in there to turn it which leads to burns. I discovered using a flat spatula (pancake flipper type) was easier since it has a longer handle and you can quickly loosen the chicken pieces from the bottom of the pan. I might consider doing the browning in a skillet first then transferring everything to the pressure cooker. Besides that technicality it was AMAZING. My kids and husband ate it all and practically licked the plate. Thanks for a great recipe!",
