I did use the Mexican blend today and I will say that s a very subtle flavor in this gratin. Using a mandolin this was a snap to make and I will add some of those buttery crackers to the top of the gratin next time. Really good way to use up some of that abundance of summer squash.

I doubled the cheese and did not have the blend so I used 1/2cup of mozzarella and 1/2 cup of cheddar. I used ritz seasoned crumbs didn't have the crackers. I used all yellow squash and instead of the shallot I used a yellow onion. I also added crumbs on the top for an extra crunch. It was delish!! Thanks for sharing your recipe!!",
