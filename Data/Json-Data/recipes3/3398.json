Here's a tip for you that will save you lots of time. Trim the crusts spread the shrimp mixture on both sides coat with the breading and THEN cut into triangles. My hubby said he thinks these really need dipping sauce so we tried traditional cocktail sauce and peanut sauce. We liked both but I'll play around with some other sauces to find the best. I don't fry often but these were worth the splurge and we thoroughly enjoyed them.",
