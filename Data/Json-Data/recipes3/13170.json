When it hits hot oil it will spatter everywhere if you don't .  You could get burned badly and if it hits your floor it may cause slippery falls.\nAlso, instead of straight flour add lots of cornstarch and the bites will be nice and crunchy.  I use only cornstarch  with a little salt and they come out great.  You can also make a batter using soda water and they will come out puffy.",
