I zested the lime then juiced it. added 1 Tablespoon honey,I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander instead of the cilantro as it is the seed of the cilantro and has about the same taste and mixes into the marinade easier. Chicken breast would be fine but I used thighs. This was great ! ",

I've made this a couple of times now and it's a family favorite.\n\nI added one beer (Miller Light) doubled the amount of honey and lime juice (also added a couple of squirts of lemon juice), mixed together & set aside.\n\nAfter rinsing off the breasts & patted them down with a paper towel, I scored them and seasoned with adobo (puerto rican seasoning salt - but I think any seasoning salt would be fine), pepper, minced garlic (garlic powder is OK too).  I didn't have cilantro either time, but that would also be a great addition.\n\nI poured the wet mixture over the chicken and let it sit for 30 minutes, turning the breasts over halfway.  My husband grilled them on medium heat for about 9 minutes per side and both times the chicken came out very juicy.\n\nThe marinade goes thru the entire chicken!!  I've made many marinades before but this one is tops because it takes very little time, easy ingredients & perfect result!",
