I would use sliced olives next time and use 5 medium potatoes. Using only 3 for 6 chicken breats was not enough. I did not like the cocktail onions so I ate around them but I think they gave the dish the nice flavor. I probably would try this again but not very often.",

                "reviewBody": "This was really tasty. The broth was good and rich. One problem I had as written is that the mushrooms and peas get overcooked in the end. The next time I make this I will wait to add the mushrooms when I add the potatoes and there is really no reason to cook the peas that long either. If they are already thawed as recipe states they really only need dropped in for a minute or two and stirred. I also pulled the chicken out before adding the potatoes and chopped it into cubes out of personal preference. With all of the other stuff going on in the recipe I think it would have been awkward to try and eat with the bone in the way. On that note I think boneless skinless chicken breast cut up would work just fine in here seeing how there is plenty of flavor going on.",
