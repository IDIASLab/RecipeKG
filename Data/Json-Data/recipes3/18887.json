Importantly, what makes a Cuban sandwich a true Cuban sandwich is not just the correct filling ingredients.  It\u2019s those ingredients on AUTHENTIC CUBAN BREAD.  Not French Bread, Italian, or anything else.  If the bread isn\u2019t authentic Cuban, it\u2019s not a Cuban sandwich.  Additionally, the so-called store brand \u201cCuban\u201d bread is not authentic - too doughy. I\u2019m a Tampa native who relishes the local history and traditions.",
