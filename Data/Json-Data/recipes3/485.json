I just made one box of pudding and layered it on top of the pan of brownies, added the cool whip and then the  candy topping. I like making it this way because it is easier to store and transport for those potluck dinners. I have also found it to be yummier if it is refrigerated over night.  I have also tried crumbling oreos on top of the whipped cream instead of using toffee or it is also good without the candy layer at all!  Defintely a winner!",
