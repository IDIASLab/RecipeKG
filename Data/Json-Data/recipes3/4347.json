I was also attracted to the healthy additions of oats, bran, buttermilk and egg.  I wasn't sure of the necessity of the baking soda, why dry milk powder in addition to buttermilk or why oat bran in addition to rolled oats. I also used one of my two bread machines, the new one, that I'm not all that familiar with, particularly in what order I should PUT all these ingredients!  This was a true experiment, much as I now understand it must have been for the submitter, who remarked that this recipe is \"the end result of trial, error and continuous tweaking.\"  Well, it paid off.  I really liked this hearty, oat-y, but soft bread.  I don't know how or why all the ingredients work together but they do. This is a great bread, something a little different than just plain white, and I actually prefer this to the heavier, more strongly flavored wheat bread. It's a beautiful creamy beige in color, with flecks of the oat bran throughout, reminding  you that you're eating something a little healthier for you than just plain white bread too. (Though just plain white Italian bread will ALWAYS be my favorite!) I'm not sure why in more than seven years only nine people have reviewed this recipe - the last review nearly two years ago -  but be assured this is a wonderful, grainy, flavorful bread I hope more people will try in spite of the long list of ingredients.",
