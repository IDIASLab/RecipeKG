I followed instructions as written but added 2 extra minutes to the end time to cook the peppers a little more. My only suggestion is to make sure you salt the caulirice and the avocado, and warm the salsa (especially if you use more than the recipe calls for, as I did). This recipe is really full of flavor and amps up the caulirice, which can sometimes be bland.",

Some paprika, chili powder, garlic and onion powder, coriander, cumin, and oregano is what I'd use to make taste more fajita-like. I also didn't bother with using 1/3 of each kind of pepper---I simply sliced 2 whole peppers and used that. I also served it on regular rice in place of cauliflower. I would make this again, but with additional seasonings. Thank you for the recipe!",
