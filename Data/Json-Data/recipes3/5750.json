Looking the recipe over again before I submitted my review I saw where CANUCKLEHEADMOM suggested using \"Really Good Scalloped Potatoes.\" My suggestion was going to be that the next time I try this soup I was going to add Cheddar Cheese Soup instead of the Cheddar cheese but after looking up the recipe I see that cheese soup was used in the original recipe of \"Really Good Scalloped Potatoes.\" I think it would make good soup with any scalloped potatoes using a can of Cheddar Cheese Soup and chicken broth. I would only use garlic powder to taste. As it says \"add omit experiment!\" Thank you CANUCKLEHEADMOM for the idea of making soup out of leftover scalloped potatoes.",

We made a couple of changes to the original recipe. We used 3 cups low sodium chicken broth instead of 4 cups and in lieu of that added a cup of light half n half. We had some leftover ham so that was easy to cut up and add. But we also added 1/2 cup finely chopped celery and 1/2 cup finely chopped onion. We made it just like the recipe said but we did not add the half and half until AFTER the soup came to a boil (did not want to curdle the milk). We added the half n' half along with the Parmesan Cheese and Shredded Cheddar Cheese. This soup is low-cost delicious and you could use either left over scalloped potatoes or do like we did and make the box of scalloped potatoes up fresh and use it right away. The scalloped potatoes in a box were only 98 cents so it's easy on the pocketbook. We loved this soup so much while we were eating we said Let's take some to our neighbors so we did. They kept thanking us over and over. They had bad colds and we figured since this soup has chicken broth in it it might help them.",
