We had no bread crumbs and so I altered the recipe by just laying out the chicken flat in a large casserole dish, topped with the swiss cheese and then the ham and just baked it for about 15 minutes.  Then I topped it with the soup and cream sauce and baked it until the chicken was done.  It turned out wonderfully.  Next time I will try it with the bread crumb coating :)",

After I rolled up chicken I coated with egg wash and rolled in a mix of half flour half bread crumbs with paprika. Did not need toothpicks. Then I browned rolls which locks the moisture in the chicken. Baked without sauce for about 30-40 minutes. On the stove top I combined cream with cream of chicken with herbs soup and added swiss and cheddar to the sauce. we love cheese. Very good next time i will just use milk for the sauce as cream is so fattening and did not taste much differnt. THANKS for the recipe.",

Changes I made were to dip the rolled chicken in buttermilk before breading and refrigerating the breaded chicken for 30 mins so the breading would stick better. I also baked the chicken without the sauce as we wanted the crust to be a little crispy. I didn't have any cream so I just used milk added fresh ground pepper garlic powder and dried basil. It was wonderful spooned over the chicken.",

I also added 2 cups of sauted fresh mixed mushrooms. Me and my son wait until chicken breast goes on sale and then make a ton of these bread them wrap them in saran and freeze them. The breading stays on great but do not defrost them in the mic as the cheese will melt and leak out.",

I followed all instructions pretty much to a tee, but used no salt, used thick cut sweet ham from the deli, used reduced fat cream of chicken. I had to cook quite a bit longer than 15 minutes, I would estimate I cooked it about 45 minutes. It was very moist on the inside & the outside breading was wonderful! The cheese melted a little out, but not much. I did use swiss & monterrey jack & it tasted great. My fiancee kept telling me how good it was. As a side, I made plain white rice & chopped broccoli seperately & when they were both finished, I combined them, added some pepper & butter & scooped some of the sauce from the chicken dish into rice. It was soooo good.",
