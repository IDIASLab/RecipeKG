I think I did improve it by blending the cottage cheese before mixing it into the shredded Velveeta. btw I shred my own but it does come shredded and packaged. And instead of pickle relish I used actual pimentos! Go figure. It's definitely a low calorie version of the traditional pimento cheese as that uses mayo or miracle whip!",
