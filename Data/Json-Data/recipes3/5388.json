The hand blender worked perfectly to puree it right in the pot and the soup was delicious! Perfect for a rainy day!

                "reviewBody": "While this is very good, it is also a fairly common tomato soup recipe with the standard chicken broth, tomatoes and cream.  It's certainly easy to throw together in a pinch with pantry staples, but if you want to really make this special use homemade chicken broth (I had some in the freezer), homemade marinara (also in my freezer, put up from my garden) and heavy cream rather than the half and half.  I did use the half and half this time for comparison's sake and found that the soup is just not as good as it is with rich, heavy cream - and for some reason it even looks better made with cream too!  Loved the pesto swirl at the end -again, I used homemade that I'd frozen. Reducing the chicken broth really isn't necessary, and I don't add the cream until after the tomatoes and broth have simmered a bit.  Great soup for little time and effort.",

I then added a can of homemade tomatoes and a can of condensed soup. I let that simmer for another 10 minutes to let it thicken up. I ran it through the blender to take out the chunks and then added the half and half. I also used much more pesto then what the recipe calls for. I stirred it right into the pot rather then spooning it out into the bowls...probably about a 1/4 cup or so. Turned out delicious! I served it with toasted chicken salad sandwiches for lunch.",
