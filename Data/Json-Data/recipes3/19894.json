AMAZING I didn't have tarragon or chili powder. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of oregano cumin and crushed red pepper and about 1 teaspoon of kosher salt. I doubled the amount of beer - I used Dos Equis. I backed off on the hot sauce - Louisiana Hot Sauce We ended up using this beef for tacos but it looks like it would be amazing for just about any shredded beef application - sandwiches enchiladas or burritos.",
