I couldn't make mine the night of, so I ended up sticking it in the fridge until the next night. The veggies were pretty soggy looking, but I fried them anyway (since I went through all the work!) and they were delicious! Even the fried onion rings which didn't take the batter as well as the zucchini were yummy! I did double the breading recipe since I had more zucchini than the recipe called for and used half cornmeal, half italian seasoned bread crumbs with the normal, proportional amount of flour. Also added 1/8 to 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, probably 1/2 to 1 tsp of italian seasoning and increased the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp or more. (I am not an exact measurer, so bare with me here...) I premixed the dry ingredients and put everything in a gallon ziploc bag. So easy! The mess is minimal compared to traditional methods of frying zucchini, so that was a pleasant change! The fried result was crunchy and very flavorful. My husband and 18 month old loved it too! ",
