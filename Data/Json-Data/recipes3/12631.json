We love having it the next morning for breakfast served with eggs over easy - wow nice filling farmhouse-style breakfast. Usually I make it exactly as written and I m never disappointed. Last time I made this I added a couple cloves of garlic. That was good too. I ve used red onion instead of green and that works well. I don t even measure ingredients anymore. It s really a reliable ingredient combo. Sometimes I add more butter - a few tablespoons probably. If I m reheating it in the oven I ll stir in some cream and that works very well. I might try a few diced jalape\u00f1os in it next time. I think one could even sub sausage for bacon? This is a great recipe to make as-is or change it up from time to time. Always fantastic.",
