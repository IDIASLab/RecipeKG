I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the salt.  I cut the salt amount in half, as I was unsure if omitting it would affect the recipe.  To be honest, the next time (and there will be a next time) I make this recipe, I will omit it completely, as I don't normally use salt in my cooking, and I don't think it will be missed.  Thanks for the great recipe!!",

I didn't have quite enough vinegar on hand so I made up the difference with apple juice. Also cut the salt down to 1 tablespoon. It does have a very strong odor when boiling so keep a window open. Next time I may try boiling it on my grill's side burner - no smell in the house and I can transfer it right over to the grill when it's done boiling.",
