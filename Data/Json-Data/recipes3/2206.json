I read some of the other reviews and thought that the celery salt sounded good. So I added salt, pepper, celery salt, and garlic powder to the potatoes while they were cooking. I then added a bit more pepper, celery salt with the dash of Thyme when I added in the milk/soup. I stirred in about 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese before serving. Garnished with additional shredded cheese and crumbled bacon. It was sooo very good. My boyfriend went back for seconds - that never happens. Later that night he told me he can't wait for lunch the next day so he can have leftovers. I will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks!",

I covered the potatoes with just enough water to cook them and I didn't drain the water (like the other person said) it wasn't necessary. Plus that would've drained off the onions. Instead of 2 1/2 cups of milk I used 1 1/2 C. and 1 C. of sour cream and 1/2 C. of cheese. When serving I added the bacon and more shredded cheese. It was DELICIOUS!!!",

I also lowered the milk to 1.5Cups added a cup of sour cream and stirred in 1C of Cheddar just before serving. EVERYONE loved it and the leftovers were great too. Adding to original review: I was short on time so I didn't cube the potatoes (just cut into big chunks) but right before adding all the creamy ingrd's I used a potato masher to smoosh up the softened potatoes. Worked GREAT and made the soup nice and thick! Also I've saved some bacon grease so when I don't want to use (or have) bacon I just use the grease when cooking the onions and still get the great flavor!",
