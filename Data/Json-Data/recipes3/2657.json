These will be mushy if the muffins are not toasted prior to spreading on the mixture. Also:taste taste taste! The olives and curry make this extremely salty. Extra-sharp cheddar can add to the saltiness so I always use mild. You can almost halve the curry without losing the flavor if curry isn't your favorite.",
