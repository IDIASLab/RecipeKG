This was quite the turkey! the stuffing was a bit wet for the bf and he complained that there were no seasonings on the turkey itself but otherwise he liked it. It is a very moist turkey. Mine took 5 hours to cook but it was also an almost 20 lb turkey so I am not surprised. If not horrendously flavorful it is nice and moist. If I do this again I'll salt and pepper the bird itself and rub in some poultry seasoning as well. Thanks for the recipe. Spot on directions!",

The turkey was moist and wonderful and the apples (I used green) were a great touch. I did use salt pepper and garlic powder on outside of the turkey before putting it in the bag. The hardest part of the recipe was finding the oven bags the day before Thanksgiving the first 2 stores were sold out! Thanks for sharing!!!",
