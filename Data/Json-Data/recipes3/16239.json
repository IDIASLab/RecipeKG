For extra flavor I also added 1t garlic powder to the meat while it was cooking and 1/4c parmesan cheese and 1t garlic powder to the mashed potatoes. My family gave it \"two thumbs up\". My hubby has asked me to make it for his fishing campout with his buds! Now that's a compliment!:-)PS I used all frozen veggies since we don't care for the canned version.",

I added some sharp chedder cheese. The one complaint I got was the WHOLE tomatoes I will use the chopped can of tomatoes when I cook it for church Sunday. I may get brave and add some sour cream with the potatoes to give it a perk!! There was alot of crust but I like that. Made it really pretty too. I suggest to those who don't like much crust to just make less crust. I like crust of the top and bottom. Just grease your dish with butter or spray and it won't stick. I think this is so far the best recipe on this site I've come across so far... but I have plenty to try.",
