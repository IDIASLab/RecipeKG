This is a good base but it needs a little help. As another reviewer said it does have a chemical taste. I think that's because it's way too much pudding mix and not enough cool whip. The cool whip needs to be doubled as with the fruit cocktail. Also I reccommend not draining the fruit cocktail as the pudding mix will thicken it anyways. I also added mini marshmallows and coconut to mine and topped with a maraschino cherry. DB ate it all up and demanded heaping seconds! I will keep this recipe around but will have to keep tweaking it to get the right consistency.",
