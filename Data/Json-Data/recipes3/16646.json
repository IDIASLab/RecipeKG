What I love about it is that everyone has an individual serving and service is simple. Toss up a salad and dinner is done! Servings can vary depending on how hungry everyone is. Kids usually eat one and hungry husbands can easily eat two. You be your own family's judge. Rest assured everyone will love these.",

I also used part skim ricotta & mozzarella to make it even lower in fat  & calories. I like using the spinach to add extra nutrition. You can add or subtract spices according to your tastes, as well as add more or less jarred tomato sauce (or make your own tomato sauce) according to your family's tastes. Overall very good & much healthier than regular lasagna roll-ups! Thanks, Babs.",

I used 3/4 of a 15 oz. container of ricotta and 3/4 cup of mozzarella because the mixture seemed a little dry. It had the perfect consistency and rolled without the filling coming out of the sides. Very important you follow the recipe submitter's advice and leave 2\" on the end of the lasagna noodles. As you roll the filling will push to the end - if you don't leave the extra room the filling will push out the end. Thanks for the recipe Javaqueen - I will definitely be making again!",
