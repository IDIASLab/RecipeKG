I dipped in flour first, then egg (and left it to marinade for about 20 mins), then flour again, then egg and then finally coated in flour and tossed in the pan.  I heated the pan first, then the butter, then put the chicken in and it browned quickly.  I also pounded it pretty thin.  The coating was perfectly crisp and it even stayed pretty decent with the broth, but next time I think I will keep the broth separate and instead pour everything over linguini.",

On my first attempt I should have\r\nrealized not to follow the instructions so closely and use a little more common \r\nsense, because when I poured the chicken stock/lemon juice mixture over the \r\nsauted chicked breasts and simmered it caused the coating to undo itself from\r\nthe chicken.  It would have been better to have kept the chicken separate and\r\nprepare the chicken stock/lemon juice mixture separately and pour over the \r\nchicken at the last minute.  Also I found thickening the stock/juice slightly with\r\na flour and water mixture improved it (clings to the chicken better) and also I \r\nadded a little bit of lemon zest to both the egg batter and the stock/juice.  \r\nThe presentation of my first attempt was not attractive, but the taste was \r\nsuperb so I'll have to thank Paula for this recipe.  My second attempt will most\r\ndefinitely be c'est magnifique!  ____________________________________ Joe Marx",

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely TA DIE FOR!! Seriously out of dozens of recipes I've tried on allrecipes this is by far one of THE BEST. I took the recipe a little further. I marinated the chicken breast in lemon juice & lemon pepper spices first for about 15-20 min. at room temp. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the skillet before throwing the chicken in. And I added more paprika on the chicken after putting it in the skillet. After the chicken was cooked I took it out and put in on a plate then wrapped it in foil to keep it hot. Then I made a sort of gravy/sauce out of the leftover chicken broth etc in the pan. I just mixed in corn starch milk and a little chicken stock. To serve I put cooked egg noodles on the plate first then the sauce and then topped it with the chicken. Served with sweet corn & it was an amazing meal. It would also have been really good if I cut the cooked chicken up and mixed the sauce egg noodles and chicken all together. Oh & I did have to make extra sauce - the egg noodles soak it up. Finally I did not put the sauce/gravy over the chicken. It didn't need it - it was incredible without it! The author's description of the chicken said \"Heaven\" & it's really true this meal was HEAVEN on a plate. My fiance kept saying over and over \"THIS IS AWESOME!\" He couldn't eat it fast enough & kept asking for seconds. His friend who was a Caterer for the stars also LOVED it! THANKS!!!!",

First you heat the pan, then heat the oil.  Make sure the oil is hot, then  flour, egg your chicken then add to pan.  The trick is, you can only flip your chicken once, after the shell has formed on the chicken and is golden brown.\n\nVery delicious!! I omitted the garlic powder and paprika.  Will definitely add next time as well as white wine.",

I simmered the chicken in the sauce until it reduced to the point where I wanted it to be. We thought this was outstanding but I can see how the original instructions would yield a somewhat bland product with potentially no crust sticking to it so that's why not 5 stars. But if you add additional herbs (I used 1/4 tsp. Mrs. Dash 1/4 tsp. paprika 1/4 tsp. pepper and 1/8 tsp. salt) and dredge flour-eggs-flour I think everyone would come up with the same fantastic result. Too bad it isn't written that way -- this is a hidden gem which lacks only a little seasoning \"to taste\" to make it outstanding. Thanks for sharing!",

Use 1/3 cup of lemon juice to intensify the flavor. The coating sticks much better if you first coat the chicken in the flour mixture, then dip in the egg mixture, then coat in the flour mixture again. Combine 2 Tbs butter and 2 Tbs olive oil in a medium hot skillet. Hot frying oil prevents greasy coatings. When chicken is browned on both sides, add half of the lemon juice and broth, cover and lower heat to a simmer (medium-low) for 20 minutes. Turn breasts after 10 minutes. Near end of cooking time, add rest of broth and lemon juice for a wonderful sauce. Remove chicken, and sprinkle capers into skillet to liven the sauce further. Turn heat to high and stir until liquid begins to boil. Pour sauce on serving platter and place chicken with lemon slices atop.",
