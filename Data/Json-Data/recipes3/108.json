It is then topped with thinly sliced provolone. It produces a red white and green layer effect like the Italian flag! When you turn the torte out of whatever receptacle you've molded it in (I've had it in a small round cake shape) stick herbs such as fresh minced chives and basil to the sides (it will stick to the cream cheese). This has been served at our company functions several times...it is very elegant if done right. And it is seriously good!",

Very easy to make and can be prepared a cday or two ahead of time whioch is awsome I added 2 pieces of provolone cheese to the top then added the peppers chopped fine pretty presentation! Thanks for sharing. I have a suggestion: when reviewing or even sending in a recipe please state how far in advance it can be made or if it can be frozen when you are having a large party this information is SO HELPFUL!!!!!",

Then after flattening each slice of cream cheese I layered first the cream cheese then pesto then cream cheese then peppers until all were used up ending with peppers on top.
