I don't use any celery and I omit the condensed golden mushroom soup. I add 1 small can tomato sauce to the rotel tomatoes. Also I add 2 cloves of garlic in with the onions and bell peppers. You can use frozen crawfish tails or shrimp too! For spices I add 1 bay leaf cayenne pepper black pepper and Tony Chachere's to taste. My whole family loves it everytime I make it and it is a great recipie to double for company.",

For one it's missing a roux. \"Etoufee\" is French for burned/burnt which means you've gotta burn something (hence the roux). Also traditional Cajun/Creole cooking does not involve any condensed soups. If you're looking for an etoufee there are plenty of good recipes on here (look for butter or oil and flour in the recipe). But if you just want to have a nice creamy crawfish dish this'll do.",
