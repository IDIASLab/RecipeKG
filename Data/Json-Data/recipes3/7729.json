I did make a couple of minor changes mostly out of necessity. For instance I live nowhere near a metropolitan place where the suggested cheese is available so I shredded in pepper jack cheese instead. I also thought it would be nice sprinkled on top so I shredded a liberal amount there. (It made a wonderful golden crust! I did cut down on the baking time by about 10 minutes though...so as not to burn the cheese.) I was out of cayenne pepper so I threw in some red pepper flakes instead.",

In a sheperd's pie you only need potatoes for the top but in a pastel de papas you need it for top and bottom and this was barely enough for a top. A WORD OF WARNING: if you're cooking less than 8 servings check the amounts you're given! From the 2 tbsp of cheese in the 8-serving recipe I ended up with 5 CUPS!! for a 4-serving recipe! In Uruguay neighbour to Argentina and Chile our pastel de papa doesn't take cheese but I enjoyd the taste of cheese in this. We skip the eggs too and the result is a more solid mash potatoes but just as good.",

I added about 1/2 t cumin and a few shakes of chili powder, and went a little heavy on my pinch of cayenne pepper.  Lastly, I used Monterey jack cheese into the ground beef mixture, and then in the last 10 minutes of baking, I added about 2 T more of the same cheese to the top of the pie.  Smells great as it cooks.  Conclusion: Good comfort food for a cold autumn evening!  The boyfriend has never had Sheperd's Pie, and he enjoyed this.  Will make it again...",

Oh in the interest of time I do use garlic instant potatoes; two 4 serving envelopes. The other reviewer is right it could use more potatoes - depending on preference.

I used the egg despite some reviewers saying they did not as I wanted the potato to set firmly and get that nice little crust layer it does when you use egg. Hubby said it was a 2.5 - 3 star recipe as something was off in the spices but he is not sure what or he would of rated it higher. Still did not stop him going back for seconds though.",
