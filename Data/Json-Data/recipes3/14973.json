I really like the sauce and will no doubt use this sauce over chicken pieces in the oven for BBQ chicken indoors. As for wings I would use it again but with 2 improvements. When I turned them at halfpoint I had to resauce the skin side. If cooking indoors I feel they would be better on a rack over a pan especially at the end when broiling them for crispness. The other thing is I would cook them on the grill rather than in the oven to help hold the sauce on the wings. Sauce leans toward sweet which is good on the wings but I would use bluecheese or ranch for dipping. Tasty!",

They looked good but since this was the first time I've made this I tried one without the dip...bland. Then one with the dip...ketchup! So I threw the dip out and went back to my stand by Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Much better. I don't know if grilling would make much of a difference.",
