I subbed a mozzerella/provolone blend for the American cheese called for. I only used two eggs and omitted the salt and garlic, as the bread had enough. I also added Frank's Hot Sauce, as I like my food to jump in my mouth.\n\nReally good sandwich for a mom who\nnot only needed something quick but also\nwanted to use ingredients on hand. \n\nNommy!",
