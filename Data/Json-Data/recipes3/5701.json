Five stars for being a good basic recipe to use as a starting point for your own creativity with endless possibilities. What I liked best was not having to boil the orzo first drain it then proceed. I sauteed chopped cremini mushrooms along with the onion and garlic in both olive oil and butter. For a little more dimension in flavor and creaminess I used a mixture of chicken broth cream and a good glug of white wine. In addition to salt and pepper I seasoned this with some fresh thyme. Delicious!",

Nice to be able to put it on and leave it while you're doing a quick steak/chicken breast/fish fillet. My tip: I grate the garlic on a micro plane (instead of mincing) and throw it in with the onion (no chunks of burnt/bitter garlic).",
