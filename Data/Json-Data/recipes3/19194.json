I used bottled lemon juice instead of squeezing a lemon and everything was fine.  The only problem I had was with the cooking time which seemed to be a hair too long so I just took it out early.  I also mixed the pan juices into some plain white rice and it was absolutely delicious.  Overall, this was fast, easy, and good!",

I used one third to marinade some red potatoes and carrots and the rest for the chicken for about an hour. I then threw the veggies in the oven at 400 for about half an hour then added the chicken for another 40. Served over rice....mmmmm...",
