Instead, I cut it in half, placed it open side UP, sprinkled it with seasoning salt, garlic powder, dried minced onion, and oregano, and then placed half a stick of butter inside each half of the squash. I added a whole package of turkey (20 oz.) then followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. This puts any type of pasta recipe to shame! My boyfriend was  excited to have leftovers for the next day as well. I will definately be using this recipe again!",

I didn't have ground turkey on hand, so I removed the casings from 3 reduced fat sausage links, sauteed separately and drained the grease, then added to the sauce as it simmered.  I also added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings (undrained), which made the sauce extra hearty.  Next time I'm going to try adding some mushrooms, or maybe using cannellini in place of the turkey for an even healthier (and Lenten appropriate!) version.  Word to the wise - don't skimp on the grated cheese!",
