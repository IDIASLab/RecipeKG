Even the ones who passed on it HAD to try it b/c of all the raving over it. Not a single kid disliked it (it's cake for crying out loud). I made it into a 2 layer. I should have doubled the recipe then. I frosted it with whipped vanilla. The frosting was overwhelming. From my experience I would definitely follow Harriet's recommendation about sprinkling it with powdered sugar. And leaving it as a sheet cake. It's the perfect amount of cocoa and the chips add a nice surprise for a cake. I meant to add an extra half of a banana but forgot. I recommend more banana in the recipe. It IS a very yummy cake! Thanks for submitting it. It made for a memorable cake.",

I didn't have a cake mix on hand so I just found a recipe for a white cake in a cookbook and combined the dry ingredients then added everything from this recipe. The dry ingredients I added were 2 cups all purpose flour 1 1/3 cup sugar 1 tsp salt and 3 1/2 tsp baking powder. Turned out fabulous! Highly recommend it with or without frosting. Will make again.",
