I most often use thighs (with or without bone) and I don't usually brown the meat, but if I do the chicken is seasoned first and browned in a bit of olive oil. I do use more seasoning on the meat, especially the paprika and I also add seasonings to potatoes. I often add onion and always put the potatoes (cut fairly small, so they cook faster) under the chicken (they cook better in some liquid and soak up the chicken flavor too) and add a bit of water 3 to 4 Tbsp. ( more if it dries out) Then cover and cook on low to med low. Can't be too high a heat, just a simmer.",

Used boneless skin less chicken breast, a bit more butter (1 tbsp) and a small amount of olive oil. I cut a large onion and put that in the pan, the onion got very sweet and added a great flavor. I also doubled the paprika and garlic. Very easy and very tasty - nothing bland about it.",

To my family and I this needed no tweaking at all! The potatoes were SO yummy as they were flavored by the chicken and the carrots were so sweet! The chicken of course was super tender. My kids were asking for more veggies. I did have to use thighs though as that was the only chicken I had and of course they worked perfect! Some are saying this didn't have enough flavor for them, I feel that it is a simple yet flavorful meal. I grew up in the country and I prefer a meal that is allowed to flavor itself with a \"little\" help from spices. Oh and a added bonus for this dish? 1 skillet cleanup! !:)",

I them let all of them cook together with the rest if the ingredients for about 5-10 minutes and noticed it was looking a little dry so I added some chicken broth and white wine. I then let it simmer for about 20 more minutes when it came out it was perfect and very tasty!!",
