Something my mother and grandmothers passed on to me was this (if I can word it properly!)  \"Keep the numbers the same, for whatever amount of gravy you want to make.  If it's 2 Tbsp. of grease, use 2 Tbsp. of flour and 2 cups of milk.\"  I have always made my gravy following this rule and have NEVER had gravy that was too thick or too thin.  Also, do NOT add your milk all at once.  Add about 1/3 cup at a time and stir until smooth...and let it get warm before adding more milk.",

I usually buy an entire pack of thick bacon and make it all. After it's all cooked and crisp, I mix flour into the grease little by little until it becomes pasty but not clumpy. Last, add the milk little by little stirring between each addition until the gravy reaches it's desired consistency. You have to wait inbetween each addition because the consistency of the milk will change when it is heated. Remember to crumble the bacon into the gravy BEFORE seasoning with salt and pepper. If you have not made bacon gravy before, the best thing to do is to take a few teaspoons of it out, put it in a cup, and season those few teaspoons until you like the taste... then season the whole pot until you match that desired taste. This way, you won't ruin an entire pot of gravy by overseasoning it.\n\nThe most important thing to realize about making gravy is that it's more intuitive than it is following a specific recipe. ",

In my house, we always ate bacon gravy and biscuits, sometimes as an evening meal!  It is so simple and absolutely deliscious, but I would suggest that you buy lower sodium bacon, it does help cut down on the sodium count.  If you use regular bacon, make sure to add it to the gravy before you test it to season it or you will make it taste briney.  This is also deliscious served with scrambled eggs and fried potatoes.  I would suggest upping the recipe by at least double, as the suggested amounts would make a very small amount which won't serve many.  Enjoy!",

Even if you had her sitting right their next to you it wouldn't guarantee that you'd be able to make it! Gravy is difficult to learn at first, but once you've learned it you never forget it. I can't tell you how many times I ended up w/ a skillet of lumpy \"oatmeal\" \"elmers glue\" etc.... It's all in the process of learning. There is no exact amount of flour, oil, or milk to put in. It's just kind of one of those eyeball things. Sure you can have a pretty good gestimation. Oh and there is no set time on how long it takes for the oil/flour to get to the right consistency,or when to remove from heat. If your new to this you're bound to end up w/ a skillet full of lumpy mush. If not way to go you mastered gravy a lot faster than most of us. So the moral of this rant is chill out peeps and quit criticizing her! I give her 5 stars for having the melons to put her recipe out there. You go girl!",

Other than accidentally over salting it a bit, it tasted delicious. I added a couple dashes of steak seasoning. Next time I will use less salt and pepper and more steak seasoning.
