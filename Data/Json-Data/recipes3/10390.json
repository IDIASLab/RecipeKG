Also I added a bit of garlic powder to the breading mixture.  These were so yummy and soaking them in the milk mixture really brought out the sweetness in the onion when you ate them with the crunchy breading.  I just used some regular yellow/white onions and they were perfect.  I served these on top of some mini burgers and we also ate some on the side.  They are very addicting!  Thank you for the recipe!  I will be making again and again!",
