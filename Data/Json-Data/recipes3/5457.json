The third time, I ran out of pine nuts, so I subbed some walnuts for a portion of the pine nuts, and I did mostly kale with only a little basil for the flavor, and it was still amazing! This is a fabulous recipe -- thank you!",

Really excellent pesto - and I imagine it would be just as delicious with basil or any other greens variation.  The amount of garlic was perfect, not overpowering; the nutritional yeast (which I love) adds a wonderful cheesy taste.  The arugula lent a slightly bitter bite that I enjoyed just as much as I like regular basil pesto.    So, I posted the review anyway to encourage others to try the recipe - even if all they have is arugula.    UPDATE:  I have now made this with just regular basil from my garden.  Served in a grilled veggie pasta salad to hordes of hungry coworkers.  They loved it.    Also made it with lightly toasted almonds and basil.  I believe this was the best batch yet.  Freezes exceptionally well.",
