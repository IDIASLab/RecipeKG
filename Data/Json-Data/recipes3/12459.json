I ended up using 2 squash and 2 zucchini's since their size was not specified in the recipe and my 13x9 pan was getting full. I did cut the rosemary down to 2 tablespoons and it was plenty. I used the full amount of cayenne but in the future I would cut this in at least half. We like spicy in our house but it was a bit much for some I would adjust this based on your personal taste. Finally I would adjust the cooking temperature. As written it took over 1.5 hours for my chicken to cook After 1 hour I removed the veggies and cooked the chicken separately until it was done. I would raise the temp to 375/400 instead.",

That being said I think veggies like broccoli carrots cauliflower and potatoes are best suited with this method of roasting. I added more spices like basil & oregano to the mix with the rosemary. Good basic recipe to adapt to your own tastes.",
