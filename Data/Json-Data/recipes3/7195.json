Having read the reviews first I used equal parts of balsamic and maple syrup and a little bit less olive oil(proportionately) but kept the mustard (dijon because that's what we like best) pepper and a pinch of the salt. I used my mini-food processer to blend everything together and it has stayed emulsified (yet not thickened like mayo); don't know if the processer is what did the trick but the dressing sticks to the greens rather than sinking to the bottom of the bowl. Thanks for a great recipe! This will be wonderful with winter salads (sugared nuts goat cheese)... yum!",

Plan on at least 1/2 a cup then begin adding to taste. And, DO use REAL Maple Syrup. And I prefer a thick honey mustard (the ones in a jar) over a thinner mustard but that is just my preference. We added Pears, Blue Cheese, Walnuts, and fresh mixed greens. This dressing is the star of a great fall winter salad! This would be good with Apples, goat cheese, pine nuts etc... Great with any fall fruits.",

The only change I make to the original dressing is to add a tad less maple syrup. As a few other readers have said 'using a good balsamic' makes quite a difference.
