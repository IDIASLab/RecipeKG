I used six boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 2lbs) seasoned with garlic powder, pepper, and a little salt.  I put a little bbq sauce in the bottom and then I layered the chicken.  I covered the chicken with about 28 ounces of Sweet Baby Rays bbq sacue.  After four hours on low it was done.  The chicken fell apart and the sauce was delicious!",

It turned out PERFECT.  As noted before me, the meat fell off the bone, and was not dry at all.  Nothing short of delicious.",

Took skin off and any big ol' hunks of fat. Also stuffed inside and on top with green apples and green onions. If possible find a way to \"raise\" the chicken up from the bottom of the crockpot to get it out of the juices (bowl or bunched up foil). So good!! Be sure to let the bird rest after you pull it out and before cutting so it will retain its juiciness. Yummy!! Definately a regular!!",

The 1st time I made it the sauce thinned out and it took away alot of flavor. So the 2nd time I made it I took the skin off the meat and it made the sauce much thicker and tasty. The meat fell off the bone and my husband loves it. I plan on making it again with boneless skinless cuts of meat in the future.",
