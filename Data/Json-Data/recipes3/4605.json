Heat the oil and popcorn together until the first kernel pops. Take the pan off the heat and stir in 2-4 Tbsp. of dairy-free margarine. As soon as the margarine melts put the lid on and put the pan back on the heat. Shake frequently. The buttery flavor will be evenly spread over the popcorn, and the popcorn will pop up large with fewer \"old maids\".",

I did not opt for butter thinking that the oil alone would hold the seasonings to the popcorn - much of the toppings did end up at the bottom of the kettle but were again on top when I poured the popcorn into a bowl. Next time I will spray some Bragg's on before adding the seasonings and then exclude the salt. I'm surprised that my 3 year old liked this popcorn it wasn't too spicy for her. This popcorn is so rich in flavor that you may find that you don't need to eat a lot of it to feel satisfied. Update: I now make this with air popped popcorn - use Bragg's Liquid Aminos to stick the dry ingredients to the popcorn leave out the salt and presto a dieter's delight!",
