I enjoyed it however it didn't remind me of the traditional stuffed omelet. So I think next time what I'll do is add half the eggs to the bottom of the pan and bake for a few minutes to solidify the egg. Then add the \"fillings\" and bake a bit more to melt the cheese around the loose ingredients therefor creating a second layer. Then add the rest of the eggs and finish the cooking as normal. That way I can have mini square stuffed omelets to take with me! I ended up using 6 whole eggs and 4 egg whites and used a 9x13-inch pan (and was able to get 8 good sized squares). 2 cups of ham is a little bit too much for my taste...I will probably only use 1 cup next time and add other ingredients to make it a western omelet. Also I used fat free cheddar and upped the amount to about 1 1/2 cups.",
