I started making these before I realized I didn't have any tomatoes in the house. I also had put the last of the ginger in the house in with the swordfish I was baking so I didn't use that either. Curry leaves? Who has curry leaves just laying about? That being said what I got as a result was pretty tasty. I'm definitely going to make sure I buy some curry leaves when I go out for tomatoes and ginger! Thanks for a great idea for a side dish. Oh and I used an Anaheim chile. I'll likely use something with a little more heat next time.",
