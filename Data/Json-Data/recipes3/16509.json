It says 12 servings--but my ladle holds about a cup and my bowls hold two ladles-ful. I think we can get about 18 bowls out of this recipe estimating. I make it for dinner then we have lunches out of it for several days plus dinner the second night and we have a family of 5 (and four of us are male). One important adjustment I made--I use half and half instead of the cream. It's perfect like that IMHO--I've made it twice and have never used the cream. Even with the decreased fat it's very rich and can cause some digestive issues if you know what I mean so I know I could never use the cream in it (plus you'll save about 2 with the price difference between a quart of cream and a quart of half and half!). I also don't use 8 tablespoons of butter to saute the onions--3 is sufficient and takes a big bite out of the calorie and fat content. You won't miss it. Thank you Ron!!!!",

I tried this before adding the cream,(half and half), and it was very tasty without it, as well!  The flavours are NOT oustanding until the next day. Hubby said the first day it tasted like just cream, but the second day, WOW!! Added fresh basil at the end for a lovely flavor, and also a titch of sugar(oops). I just prefer my tomato base recipes to have a touch of sweetness.  I also think when you use that much cream in this soup, the tomato paste needs to be bumped up a bit, as I found myself adding about 1/4 cup.   So in light of my few minor changes, I can only give this 4 stars, as I tweaked a bit for my own personal preference.  I HATE it when people change the whole thing and then still only give a 2 or 3 star rating, or tweak it so it is nowhere NEAR the original and then give it 5!!!  As this recipe stands, it is truly a 4 star!! Thank you for a lovely soup!!",

We used to go to the one in Detroit but that one burned down (or something arsen related) many years ago. I have to agree that your soup is very very similar to Lelli's. I did not make it with the elbow pasta and so I only put in 1 cup of heavy cream!!! I do have to admit that I threw out the first batch I made because the Fat Free Half & Half I tried to substitute for the heavy cream was just horrible!!! The second batch I made with the heavy cream was perfect!!! Thanks for giving me a new recipe I will make over and over again! Hubby loved it too he said he was looking forward all morning to coming home for lunch and eating more of this delicious soup!",
