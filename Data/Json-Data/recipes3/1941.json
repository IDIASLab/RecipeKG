I thought that the flavor and smooth texture was not compromised at all by reducing the whipping cream amount.  My husband and I found this almost as good as the gourmet pumpkin soup that we at at Sandals in St.Lucia.",

This recipe also freezes well and doesn't change consistency when thawed for use!\r\n\r\nTip:  When creaming the soup, use a handheld blender (like a handheld smoothie maker) and just put it directly into the pot instead of transferring everything back and forth to the blender!",

First, I cooked my pumpkin in a glass dish at 375 for about 90 minutes (cut in half, cleaned out, cut side down, covered with foil).  I cooled and scraped out the pumpkin.  I then sauted onion and garlic in a little olive oil.  I then added broth, mashed pumpkin and seasonings ( I substituted 1/2 teaspoon pepper for the pepper corns).  Simmered for about 20 minutes, pureed the mixture with submersion blender (hand blender)and then added just a little 2% milk to make a little creamy.  It was really good.  I might play with the seasonings next time.  I might forgo the thyme and season with curry or pumpkin pie spice.",

I added the parsley and nutmeg prior to simmering for the last 30 minutes. This soup was so delicious that even the biggest skeptics helped themselves to more. I have made it twice and served it to all ages 2yrs to 85 yrs and everyone LOVED it! So yummy even for people who do not like the taste of pumpkin.",

Make sure you get canned pumpkin, not canned pumpkin pie filling. I sometimes use half and half instead of whipping cream, and I sometimes leave out the thyme and use cinnamon and ginger in it instead. It's also good with a little curry powder in it along with the ginger.\n",
