I followed the recipe except added maybe a little more butter to the potatoes when I browned them and some sausage along with the bacon that I had on hand. Otherwise I followed the recipe and got a very yummy dish! I think next time I'll let the potatoes thaw a little more but that was not a problem---just a little more time browning them. We already have plans for making this again! Thanks Cindy! You rock!",

I sauteed the mushrooms and onions together with a half tsp of minced garlic and three jalapeno peppers that had been de-seeded and minced in butter. I used O'Brien Potatoes because they already have Green Red and Yellow bell peppers and diced onions. I used both Pepper Jack Cheese and Sharp Cheddar and I diced up about a quarter pound of fresh asparagus and I used Egg Whites with just two Yellows in them. I realize this completely changes Cindy's Recipe but for me it helped. When it was served I also had a bowl of fresh made Pico De Gallo (Salsa) for those who wanted more spice. I haven't tried it with Spanish Style Chorizo yet but it does sound promising with Cilantro.",

One suggestion is, I put the bacon in the freezer for about ten minutes then I take it out and cut it in small strips starting at one end of the pound of bacon to the other end then I fry it. This way you don't have to break the bacon up after it is done. You can cut it to the size of chunks you want and it is ready to go for anything you need small pieces for. I always do this when I need chunk's of bacon for salads or really anything.",
