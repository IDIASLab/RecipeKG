With my husband on a diabetic diet, I immediately knew the regular mayo had to go. I replaced it with Hellmans Just 2 Good, used skim milk, and added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the dressing. I used a mix of Romaine, Spinach and Red Leaf lettuce, Halved cherry tomatoes and in place of the bacon (that pesky diabetic diet again) I used one bag of the Hormel Real Bacon Pieces. I also tossed in 1/4 cup of finely shredded sharp cheddar.  It's also great with shredded or sliced chicken breast added, it makes it taste like a chicken club salad.Even my extremely picky 6 year old loved it. Wonderful!!",

                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe for a holiday get together and it was a hit! I did modify the recipe a little based on others reviews. First I baked the bacon on a foil-lined cookie sheet at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. It took 2 batches to cook 1lb of bacon. Baking the bacon seemed to work well for this recipe b/c I was able to do some of the prep work while the bacon was cooking without having to constantly check and turn the bacon. Second I used 1 cup Hellmans lite mayo and 2 tbsp daisy sour cream. I added garlic and onion powders then added just enough 1% milk to get a good dressing-like consistency. Without the milk I thought the dressing would be too thick. I chopped 4 roma tomatoes and placed them on a plate with paper towels to soak up the juices. I chopped and peeled 1/2 cucumber. I used 1 and 1/2 heads of romaine lettuce and gave a generous sprinkle of finely shredded cheddar cheese. I mixed the lettuce cucumbers and cheese in the serving bowl. I placed my crumbled bacon in a ziplock and my chopped tomato in another zip lock. I placed a lid over my dressing and took a bag of Texas Toast garlic croutons with me. Once at the party I threw the bacon and tomato in the bowl tossed with most of the dressing and sprinkled croutons on top and viola! As a side note when I tasted the dressing before I put in all together it didn't taste all that spectacular but mixed with all the ingredients it was delicious. Also I think only real bacon (not precooked/bacon bits) wi",

Then I poured out the bacon bits and mixed them thoroughly with the chopped tomatoes so the bacon and tomatoes could flavor each other. There were lots of bacon bits still clinging to the side of the blender which I then used to make the dressing. For the dressing I used 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and 2 heaping regular (non measuring) teaspoons of sour cream but no milk (I did not need any additional salt). I also used slightly less garlic powder than the recipe called for even though I LOVE garlic. I used some bagged romaine lettuce this time but next time I will use green leaf. This was really really good! The mayo/sour cream/bacon bits dressing was delicious. I kept the lettuce tomato and bacon mixed together but added the dressing and croutons at serving time.

The dressing was 1-2 cups mayo mixed with 1/3-1/4 cup bbq sauce. Add 1 tsp. lemon juice.(use own judgement on how much dressing to use). Minced onion is optional(I don't use it).
