I used about 1 1/2 C water total then reserved about 1/4 C of the Jell-O mix to add to the frosting to give it a slight orange color. I've made a lot of poke cakes in my time and find a wooden skewer or toothpick work best for poking holes the cake won't stick on wood. Of course the orange flavor is artifical but so is it in dreamsicles so if you like more natural flavors this cake is not for you. Two thumbs up!",

However upon making it I've found that I had to improvise a bit to get it the way I had hoped it would be. I used a vanilla cake mix as suggested by other reviewers & agree that the presentation of the jello stripes looked very nice! As for the topping I wish I had omitted the jello packet or maybe just used half of it because it was way too overpowering sweet & artificial. I ended up mixing an extra box of pudding an extra envelope of dream whip (which I had already substituted one envelope for the whipped topping) & when it was still too sweet I mixed in an 8 oz block of cream cheese which seemed to do the trick in making it \"dreamsicle\" like. It went over well and I would make it again but next time I would go easy on the jello in the topping or omit it all together and add some orange extract.",
