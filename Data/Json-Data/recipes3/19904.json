First I browned the ribs in the olive oil and then dumped them into my crockpot with all of the other ingredients, cooked for about 4 hours on low and they turned out PERFECT.  These ribs were such a hit the first time I made them, I've made them several times since.",

I wasnt sure how hot the chili sauce would be and wanted it to be ok for my husband so I only added about 1/3 cup instead of the 1/2 cup it'd asked, but we couldnt taste the chili at all so it went great.  I did try using crushed pineapples like others recommended, but I didnt have a preference, but husband would of prefer the chunky afterwards.  Since it was very stewey, which, at first I was not sure about, but was GREATLY surprised by the results, I'd made jasmine rice to compliment it.  I highly recommend having the ribs and its sauce served over white jasmine rice for a complete delicious meal!  You will not be disappointed with this dish!  I'm a beginner in cooking and this is a definate keeper in my recipe drawer!  Thanks Adrienne!",
