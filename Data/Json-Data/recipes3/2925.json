It appears that the bouillion cubes need to be dissolved in water then added. The extra 2 cups of liquid would have made a huge difference as would covering the pan. Additionally it says to drain the peas then add them with the liquid. The taste was good but as written it is a disaster. Probably would benefit from a bit of cilantro as well.",
