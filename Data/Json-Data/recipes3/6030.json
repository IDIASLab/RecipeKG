I added in 1/2tsp of sugar as suggested by another reviewer and I found it to be necessary. I also added in fresh basil which definitely kicked this sauce up to the next level. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti. For my tastes I had to cook the sauce about 35 minutes the last 15 mins with a lid because the onions weren't quite done. Next time I will try this served over bread as suggested. Very simple!",
