We buy 1/2 sides of Black Angus raised on pasture with no hormones etc. It is very lean and must be cooked low and slow. This recipe was perfect for this beef. I made it while my husband was out-of-state to see if there was too much pepper for his tastes. (Translation: I get it all to myself - YUM!) I thought it was perfect as is but will probably will go a tad lighter on the pepper for my husband s tummy s sake the next time I make it. I have forwarded this recipe to Beam N Boys - where we buy our beef - so they can share it with their customers. It really is that good. Thank again Chef John!",

I did have to adapt the recipe since I could only find strips of 1 short ribs for braising. I just cut them into pieces and followed the rest of the recipe. The only difference was that the cooking time until fork tender was 3 h 15 minutes. And a lot more bones to pick out! I served it over Maple Chipotle mashed sweet potatoes and it was devine. Will definitely make again!",

I thought this deserved a 5 but the hubs wasn t a fan so I knocked off a star. Perhaps the slow cooking reduces the peppers bite and wouldn t need to be strained for the little one. She did however love it as well:) this was really easy to put together and was super tasty! For those who might want the bone in option but the meat looks thin just ask the butcher if they have any in the back. When I buy it I only buy the really thick ones. I served with polenta which was an excellent choice for the sauce.",
