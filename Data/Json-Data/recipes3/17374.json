Maybe I used too lean a bacon or something but the livers pretty well soaked up all the oil in no time flat forcing me to turn down the heat and cover for the last 10 minutes to prevent scorching. To deal with the minor dryness issue a little sour cream on top would go nice. I'll make this again.",

Instead cooked sliced garlic and pearl onions in olive oil until they released the taste and used that to cook the livers. This was another fantastic option for chicken livers. It really really made a huge difference to use fresh organic livers instead of frozen. Adding a few to morning eggs can be a luscious option! Thanks for the great recipe.",
