                "reviewBody": "This recipe took longer than the stated 1 hour and 35 minutes. From stove to table it was about 2 1/2 hours for me. I don't know how you could do it in 1 hour and 35 minutes unless you have pre-cooked bacon and a stick blender. If you have a regular blender or food processor it takes some time to puree the batches. And the result of the pureeing was a consistency of leeky Cream of Wheat with too much milk added. Not visually appealing or texturally desirable. I followed this recipe exactly and found that the delicious flavor of my smoked turkey legs was almost completely masked by the taste of the leeks. I would have been better off not putting those delicious guys in the soup at all and using them in another recipe so I could enjoy them. If I were you I would find another potato-leek soup recipe. If you happen to have it the leek and potato soup recipe in Dorie Greenspan's \"Around My French Table\" (page 66) is a good one. Otherwise look elsewhere friend look elsewhere. This \"Meaty Potato Leek Soup\" recipe is not awesome and it takes a ton of time.",
