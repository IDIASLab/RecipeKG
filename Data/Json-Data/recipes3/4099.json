Next time I make this I will probably halve them. All in all a good simple different way to make green beans rather than just with bacon and onion. I didn't have chives for this recipe but instead just used ultra-thin slices of white onion that I tossed with the beans. I then just microwaved them with the sauce and onion for about 1 minute which caramelized the sauce a little and that worked well. I served this with steamed salmon--yummy combo.",
