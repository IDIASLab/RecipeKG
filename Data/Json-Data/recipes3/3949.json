It used items I usually have on hand and made a huge huge pan full. I topped half of this with biscuits at my husband's request. This was okay and will fill you up but it isn't something we would fix again. It needed something for flavor as the vegetable soup taste was pretty dominant. It was easy to fix and made a decent comfort food. Thanks Dawn I enjoyed trying out your family recipe.",
