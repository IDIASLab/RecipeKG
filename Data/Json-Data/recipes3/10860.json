Maybe it\u2019s because I love spinach, mushrooms and garlic, and particularly when all three are used at once.  Or maybe it\u2019s because these eggs sort of mimic an omelet I make a copy-cat version of from a now defunct breakfast/brunch restaurant in Milwaukee.  It\u2019s distinctive ingredient?  Cream cheese.  Little creamy, gooey, slightly tangy bits of cream cheese.   Put all four ingredients into the eggs and it\u2019s no wonder I said yummy.  Even Hubs, who rarely rates recipe five stars, said that as far as eggs go, this couldn\u2019t be any better \u2013 five stars from him too! (Note: With six eggs I didn't bother to try and cook this without stirring and then flipping this big panful.  Rather, I just cooked this as scrambled eggs, in long, fluffy curds)",

After adding the eggs, I turned the heat to low and covered the skillet to help the eggs set, it is not easy to flip this if the top is still runny.  I would suggest a cheese other than cream cheese.  Maybe a nice white cheese that melts well.  The cream cheese didn't melt well and looked a little messy.  Thanks for a delicious breakfast.",

I enjoyed this one so much that I made it two days in a row last week:) I went to Costco today to buy the ingredients so I can make it for the husband this week. You are going to need a big spatula to flip this one I just fold it in thirds once it starts to firm up. Perfect as is but I sprinkled grape tomatoes that I cut in half right before serving (see photo;) Thanks Kel Kel for sharing your delicious recipe!",
