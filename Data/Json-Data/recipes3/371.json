The only change I made was to add some grated lemon and lime zest for a little flavor. It is a heavier cheesecake and should be served in small slices or it is just too much. But that's the way we like it here! This is a good base for other flavored cheesecakes and is thick enough to swirl in other ingredients. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
