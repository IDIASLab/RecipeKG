It s peanut butter and chocolate- what s not to love?! I almost couldn t find the peanut butter syrup but I got lucky and bought the last bottle of torani sf peanut butter syrup at a local kitchen store! It really does give it more of a peanut butter flavor!",

The peanut butter is the first pop of flavor that you get then the milk chocolate kicks in more in the background. I like my smoothies on the thicker side so I did add more ice. I had peanut butter powder on hand but the peanut butter syrup was a tough find in my area and I had to settle on one that was not sugar free. I drink a lot of smoothies and I did give this a drizzle of chocolate syrup just to be a bit indulgent.",
