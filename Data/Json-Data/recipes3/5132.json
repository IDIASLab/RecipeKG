The recipe did not specify type of mustard to use and I only had yellow so I used that. Maybe next time I'll try brown. The peanuts added a great crunch and the peas added nice color. (I left the peanuts whole.) I will use this in place of any other coleslaw recipe if the I need to make coleslaw again arises.",

I thought I'd try this for a different change of pace. It was delicious. My husband and I both love curry flavor so this was right up our ally. Here are my changes: add a small tart apple cut into little pieces use only about 1 cup of peas tops less salt toast the peanuts to bring out the flavor. I also added a little fennel seed. My husband and I ate almost the whole batch just the two of us it was so good. I made it again the next night because I still had more cabbage to use up. Brought the leftovers to a neighbor and she called exclaiming how much she liked it. I think it would be great to take to a potluck because it's different. It holds up well too. Still good after a day in the fridge. If you need to thaw peas in a hurry just put them in a bowl and run hot water over them from the tap. It thaws them out without cooking them. I hope more people try this wonderful recipe.",
