It is very similar to \"Sean's Falafel\" on this site but with split peas instead of chickpeas (which is traditionally what falafel is made of) so I thought I would like it (\"Sean's\" is great!). But having never had split peas I wasn't quite sure about it. My only changes were that I used parsley in place of the mint and baked the falafel at 400 for 10 minutes on one side & then 10 more on the other side. It is very earthy tasting and a little dry. If nothing else it is a very filling and healthy snack (if baked not fried). That warranted an extra star. I don't know if I'll try it again though.",

I modified the recipe slightly: After about 20 hours of soaking the beans were definitely not mashable so I cooked them until they were an appropriate consistency and then proceeded with the recipe. The recipe makes a LOT of falafel and I added two eggs instead of one to get the batter to come together. I also added about 50% more of the spices than the recipe calls for. I deep-fried the falafel and they looked beautiful. I might try baking or pan-frying next time to cut down on oil. The falafel were very tender and crumbled easily. I thought the flavor was great. I had them in pitas the first day and atop a salad with dill-and-yogurt dressing the second day. Both very yummy.",
