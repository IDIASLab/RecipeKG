The onions were really good done that way but I felt that the mustard sauce was missing something---I can't really put my finger on what it was. It could be that the onion wasn't really sharp enough to add the needed flavor that I thought it needed. Maybe I've been eating too many full-flavored foods lately! We did enjoy our dinner tonight so thanks Shelbylyn!",
