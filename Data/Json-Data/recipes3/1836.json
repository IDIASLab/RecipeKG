I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of honey (none in the pantry = / ) and 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the vegetable oil (for healthier AND added apple flavor!) Also, I added one packet of instant oatmeal (to boost protein and texture!). After filling the muffin cups i made a mixture of - 2 TBS butter substitute (melted), - 2 TBS brown sugar, 1/4 cup granola cereal and sprinkled on top to make a sort of crunch topping. The turned out very tasty! A bit denser and less moist than a normal muffin, but c'mon people! It's a VERY healthy recipes, don't expect it to taste like the 800 calorie starbucks muffin! I will definately make them again! ",

For raisin bran muffins I substituted half of the flour for bran and switched the apples for raisins. I also put much more cinnamon in there. Another variation I enjoyed was substituting half of the flour for corn meal and using bluberries instead of apples. Omit the cinnamon in this variation. Add some vanila instead. I've been making these muffins vegen by using soy milk and a vegen egg replacer. Works very well. One other thing I found is that the recipe is really small. I like having larger muffins with a nice size head on them. I either double or tripple this recipe. A very good recipe and an excelent place to start creating your own muffins.",
