The only 2 things I did differently were to use Jack Daniel's Dijon mustard which gave the chicken a nice smoky BBQ flavor and I used 2 extra large chicken breasts that I pounded down to about 1/2\" thick. A quick note: Don't overdo the preserves. I put 3-4T on the first chicken breast because I thought the chicken breast was bigger and would need more. Not so! The preserves didn't caramelize as nicely as the breast I only put 2T of preserves on.",
