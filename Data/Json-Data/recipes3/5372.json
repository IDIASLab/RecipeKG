I really liked the sauce so I am glad I made the change to plain yogurt as I think the key-lime yogurt would have made it way too sweet. I feel like something was missing though. It probably was the almonds but maybe raisins would be good as well? I'm not good at figuring out the magic ingredients that make dishes extra yummy.",
