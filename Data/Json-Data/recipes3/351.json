I followed the directions to make the cake (3 eggs and 1 can crushed pineapple with juice)but decided to make a pineapple upside down cake. I put 1/2 stick melted butter and 3/4 cup brown sugar in the 9x13 pan then placed 2-8 oz cans of drained pineapple tidbits (didn't have rings) and lots of marashino cherries. Then poured the batter on top. It baked at 350 close to 50 minutes or so...I kept baking til the center raised as high as the sides...it came out as moist as can be for all the baking...and has that extra pineapple taste too.",
