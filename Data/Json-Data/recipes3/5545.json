I made these several weeks ago and my husband was extremely skeptical. However after trying them he asked me to make them again. They may not be a \"crave\" food but they are a great taste-buds adventure. I will be making them many times in the future. Note: I always do my yams in the microwave as I seem to always be running short on time. Two yams 6-8 minutes on each side should do it (instead of 40min-1hr in the oven). Don't forget to poke holes in the yams first though! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I found this recipe and after reading the reviews thought I'll try it! After talking to some people who love yams I was having some reservations with the combination of ingredients. I made this and decided to just cut one potato in half first and we'd try it. It was absolutely the most delicious potato I have eaten in my life!!! WOW! We're having the leftovers tonight! My boyfriend was very impressed and he now calls them \"Yam Jammers\". The only thing is I made two Yams and it took double the time to cook..but I think the secret is to put the Yams directly on the rack of the oven and a cookie sheet underneath to catch the drippings. Thank you so much for an awesome recipe!!",

The savoury and garlicky flavour of the guac just doesn't compliment the sweetness of the potatoes that well. I guess we're used to a more sweet pairing than this.
