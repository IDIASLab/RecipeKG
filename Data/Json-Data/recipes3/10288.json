I've found that the key is to place them low in the oven so that you get a good caramelized side. Don't move or flip them, but keep an eye on them so that you don't go past 'caramelized' to 'burned.'",

To the person who gave it 1 star and said they were burnt to a crisp, it says to keep an eye on it so it doesn't go from caramelized to burnt. Common sense. Every oven is different. They also say to cook until caramelized and cooked through, ABOUT 45 min. Thank you very much for the recipe, will definitely make it again!!",
