Instead of sherry i used marsala wine (double the amount it called for) and fresh garlic and basil fettucine. I did use a yellow pepper but a white onion was what i had on hand. my husband and i were both impressed with this meal and i let him take the leftovers for lunch!",

I used a red bell pepper and just regular cream cheese. I also added some fresh cilantro after the cream cheese and it turned out pretty good...and tasty! To finish it off I sprinkled fresh parmesan cheese over top and served with garlic bread. If I could make a suggestion it would be to let it sit on the stove covered for about 5 minutes before you serve it so the sauce can thicken up a little (as mine was initially a little runny).",
