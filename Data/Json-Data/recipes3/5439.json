The cheesy green beans are really good even for leftovers. I use fresh green beans and I cook them down to where they are soft before baking them in the casserole they have lots of good flavor and are a must at our holiday table. The only change I make is I line the bottom of the dish with the fried onions and then top with them as well to add a bit more flavor. Besides you can never have too many fried onions!",
