I put BBQ sauce on in and ate it but my best recipe using 3 ingredients cannot be beat. Remove membrane over ribs. Take baking sheet and 2 layers of Aluminum foil. \nSet oven to 350F. Put ribs rib side  up. Sprinkle garlic powder, any dry BBQ spice you like. Then drizzle warmed honey thinly over ribs. Bake 1 hour 15 min. Pour off grease into coffee can.  Turn ribs over and repeat garlic, BBQ spice and drizzled honey. Bake another hour. If it is getting too brown, decrease the temperature. Awesome! I went from electric oven to gas and it cooks quicker in the gas oven.\nMonica Sanders",
