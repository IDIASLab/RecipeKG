Sauteed spinach with the onions/celery and added pepper and lemon with the hot sauce/mustard combo. Split the chicken breast length wise like a sub sandwinch but not completely and stuffed the breast that way keeping it closed with bamboo skewers. Added a little oil lemon and pepper to the pan again then sauteed the breast the entire time rather than on the grill. The juices helped keep the breast tender with the pan covered.",
