I find this makes for a firmer baked tofu. The first time I coated the tofu and baked it according to the directions. The second time I coated the tofu then fried it in just a little oil on both sides just till golden then I baked it. I found this made a pleasing crunchy coating. I used my bottled barbeque sauce as is rather than adding the additional ingredients. I like the coating and the addition of the bbq was good. I serve this with homemade coleslaw and corn on the cob for a summer bbq treat. I will make this again.",

As some other commenters suggested. I fried it up in a pan with just some spray oil then baked it. It then occurred to me that with the Italian seasonings and bread crumbs maybe pasta sauce would be a more appropriate topping than barbeque. So that's what I did and it was FAB. My husband said it was just like eating lasagne. I felt like I was eating cubes of ricotta and my subconscious starting telling me I would get fat! But no it's just tofu. Delish!",
