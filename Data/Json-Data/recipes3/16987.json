I used swerve sweetener an extra 2 tablespoons of coconut flower doubled the cream & milk 4x baking powder and no baking soda. I also added a 1/4 tsp of almond extract but I will Probably add less of it next time I bake them as it overpowers the coconut quickly. No issues with the salt for me. The consistency was good. Soft and chewy. I ll Make again with my modifications.",
