I did make a few changes and additions though.  First of all, the tortellini shouldn't be cooked IN the soup.  The starch from the tortellinis only causes the soup to thicken like a stew and they end up being overcooked and mushy.  I cooked them seperately and added them to the bowls at service time.  This soup was also lacking color, so I added some shredded carrots to the simmering broth to add both flavor and color.  With all this being done, the soup was wonderful.",

I sauteed a whole chopped onion, 3 cloves of garlic, and 1 whole carrot, cut into matchsticks. I ended up using 3 cans of stock and 3 addtl cups of chicken boullion. Once the broth boiled, I reduced the heat and added 2 chopped tomatoes and almost a whole bag of chopped frozen spinach. I only simmered it for about 5 minutes, so the spinach would not overcook. I boiled the tortellini seperately and added it once the soup was off the heat. This is a fabulous meal! I got veggies into my husband!!

My changes: 1. I added a can of corn drained. 2. Used Italian flavored diced tomatoes and eliminated the other spices. 3. Cooked chicken in a skillet shredded and then added to pot. 4. Only cooked the tortellini for 3 to 5 mins. My suggestion would be to make the soup and keep the tortellini separate - especially if you're anticipating leftovers. Simply add the pasta you're going to eat immediately for a few minutes before storing. Allows the rest of the soup to keep better for eating leftovers. The pasta starts to fall apart after being in the fridge for a day.",

Doubling the recipe I used a bag of cut frozen spinach and color wasn't an issue with my tri-colored dry cheese tortellini. I was skeptical of the basil and garlic powder but it was fine. However I'd suggest low-sodium broth as it got salty at the end (the tortellini?) as well as adding more broth. Still something seemed to be needed so I brought to the table hot sauce lemon parmesan cream...trying to discover the missing ingredient. Parmesan was great as was the TJoe's hot sauce and lemon but the real winner surprisingly was my 10-year-old's addition of lemon pepper! To my amazement it really worked (Lawry's brand anyway...)!",
