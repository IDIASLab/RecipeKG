Also, for people who may have felt it didn't have enough flavor, try using a little extra ginger, a little cayenne pepper, some cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice.  Adds a little more Thai / Latin American influence.  Hearty and reheats really well; we'll be making this again.",

I had some preparation problems with not having a pot large enough to hold all of the ingredients together for the tossing so I ended up dividing it in half and tossing it in the pan I cooked the chicken in and the other half in the pot I cooked the noodles in. I might use penne pasta next time though I liked the change in using rotini. Instead of heavy cream I used 3/4 cup of lactaid skim milk and 1/4 cup margarine. The sauce isn't as thick that way but it cuts down on the fat and is lactose-free:)",

The chicken is only okay for me but Im not a big meat eater and I think this would be just as good without it. I guess I will be doing some experimenting of my own! Lovely dish!",
