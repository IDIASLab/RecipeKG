Two suggestions I picked up from other reviews were using the fat free cream of chicken soup and the \u00bd cup chicken broth and \u00bd cup of Marsala wine and I am glad I did.  I did dredge the chicken breast in flour mixed with the ground pepper and  \u00bd tsp. of garlic powder. Doubled the mushrooms using 8 ounces and also used a whole shallot chopped fine instead of the onion.  I browned the chicken separately , removed and set aside.  Then saute'd the  shallots, some fresh garlic minced and the mushrooms. Added the Marsala, chicken broth and chicken soup, blended well in the same skillet, brought to a light boil, turn down to simmer then returned chicken to the skillet.  Let it simmer about 5-6 minutes.  Perfect!  Chicken does not get over cooked this way.",

I used \"Akadama\" which is a sweet red wine and I substituted \"shitake\" mushrooms for the cremini mushrooms. I gave it 4 stars but my partner who is Japanese would give it 2.5 stars and the reason is that the first few bites are really delicious but after that the flavor is a bit \"persistent\". (Japanese people in general prefer more delicate flavors...) I would definitely make this again. It was quick and easy! For the pasta I used \"fresh\" fettucini pasta.",
