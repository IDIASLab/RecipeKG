But as I prepared my sauce I realized I had no mushrooms or bell pepper. I decided to give it a go anyway and oh my word just the red onion (and 3 small cloves garlic) in the sauce and it was incredible! The wine and the sweetness of the red onion when it cooked down worked so well together. I used fresh asiago and a little fresh tomato between the chicken and spinach (which I didn't wilt since the dressing was still simmering when I poured it on the spinach) then topped it with some green onion...It was so easy and looked beautiful and tasted phenominal! I can't wait to do it right with steak and blue cheese! What a perfect recipe!",

OK....so I made a little deviation from the recipe....I grilled my peppers red onion and portabello mushrooms and reduced the dressing and wine mixture seperately. I used a little evoo salt and pepper on the meat and grilled. Plated the salad added the sliced grilled veggies topped with the steak crumbled blue cheese and the dressing....and a few crutons. What a meal! The steak was tender and juicy and it was just all around a satisfying dinner....will definately make again!",

So I mixed the wine and a 1/4 cup dressing in a small sauce pan and simmered 'till syrupy as the recipe calls for. Next time though I will let the dressing settle first and remove most of the oil as the wine sauce was a little oily (I used Robusto Italian by Kraft). Also I will wilt the spinach just barely before topping with everything else. The blue cheese was amazing on here and the cooked veggies were a nice change. Will make again with those 2 changes! Thanks for the recipe! Oh and before plating I thought the wine sauce tasted a little odd but it was delicious once on the salad and mixed with everything else!",
