My husband and I saw the idea of fried bacon on the travel channel where they just battered and fried it and we decided to make it.  It was so good.

Usually I can never make enough bacon because everyone fights over it and because it lacks so much in nutritional content I don't make it often. However I won't make this again. The flour coating is just too bland. I added more pepper and salt than called for and it still lacked flavor. It actually made the bacony flavor of the bacon sort of disappear. My family of seven kinda picked at it and broke it into pieces and mixed it with the gravy. The white gravy is what made this bacon somewhat tolerable. Like I said we LOVE bacon and I don't even mind greasy foods but coating and frying this bacon made it bland.",
