It was fairly to very good as written. However the next time I make it I would change the following: probably 1/2 of the cayenne pepper as it was pretty spicy. Since the spices go in last the vegetables were highly seasoned and the chicken was just plain chicken so I will try rubbing the spices on the chicken before browning to spice it up a bit and tone down the veggies at the same time. Finally it may just be the temp. I cooked at but there was LOTS of liquid left when everything else was cooked so I will try cutting the amount in 1/2 and see how that works. All in all a great recipe that just needs tweaked slightly.",

I chopped the chicken and brown and I also sauteed the vegetables and took it off the heat.  I brought my potatoes to a boil in beef broth(the recommended amount).  When it started to boil, I added all the seasonings and let it boil for 10 minutes uncovered).  Then I added the chicken and the veggies stirred, brought to a boil, then covered and simmered for 20 minutes.  This should work.  It was like stew instead of watery.  Since the liquid had a chance to evaporate when boiling the potatoes.  I hope that this helps.",

I got excited at first because the sauteed vegetables looked really good. But once you simmer it it just tastes like canned green beans. I really hate the taste of canned green beans. I thought it would be OK mixed in but it's not. I added a ton of garlic salt and that made it edible but I didn't like it. Even my 13 month old daughter refused to eat it. It might be OK with frozen beans. And it is soupy like everyone said but it kind of has to be in order to cook the potatoes I think.",
