The flavour was good, sort of like the fancy, savoury flavours you could get from a packaged rice as a side.  However, it didn\u2019t taste anything like sushi rice (which is what I was looking for originally) and of course it wouldn\u2019t since the recipe didn\u2019t have any vinegar.  Otherwise, I\u2019ll keep this recipe as a side dish to go with a main dish or even as a base for a savoury rice bowl.",
