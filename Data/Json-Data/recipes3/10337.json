Avocados are a favorite, and it's normal to add tomatoes, lime juice, and green onions for a \"normal\" guacamole, but the capers gave it a nice salty bite and the tuna adds more!  I don't know where you came up with the idea for this recipe, but it's one I could see myself noshing on with wheat crackers for a healthy and delicious lunch.  YUM!",
