It is an excellent sauce you can add other spices or herbs depending on what your using it for I myself added garlic and Italian spice in the reviews people complained about vinegar in the recipe and they need to re read it as it states red wine no where did I see red wine vinegar as they complained about as I think that's all they had on hand their mistake not the poster of the recipe this is truly amazing sauce give it a try and use RED WINE not red wine vinegar!!!!",

The ingredients call for red wine vinegar but the directions say to add the red wine. Hmm I chose to go with the vinegar but used half the amount. I was worried about the acidity of the tomatoes and the vinegar so I added two large bay leaves at the start of the simmering time. After an hour of simmering I tasted and the sauce needed a boost so I added 2 cloves of minced garlic. With these few changes it was an excellent sauce. I do wonder what the submitter intended..vinegar or wine? addendum: I see that the ingredient list has been corrected to include red wine instead of red wine vinegar which was listed in the original ingredient list. I made it again and again I added the fresh garlic it just seems to be missing it!",
