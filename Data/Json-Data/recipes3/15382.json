Truffles are pretty simple and easy to make but I will put the chocolate mixture in refregirater more than for 1 hour because it was a little sticky. I didn t microwaved the cream just cooked over low heat until hot. I used dried lavender and I didn t coat the truffles they looked beautiful just dipped in chocolate. My only complaint is that this recipe makes only 12 truffles.",

I used 1 oz per batch and they were much better. Food grade lavender in bulk is the way to go. These are amazing. Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!!!",
