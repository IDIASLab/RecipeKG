I sliced the onions and  mushrooms and mixed up the meat patties (including the pork) in the morning, put them in the fridge, and then this was just a breeze to make later for dinner in the Instant Pot\u00ae.  The gravy is absolutely delicious, and that little bit of red wine adds incredible richness and depth of flavor.  Do use a good-quality beef broth/stock (the only one that I buy is Kitchen Basics\u00ae for beef, chicken, and vegetable), and it\u2019s what has been used in every cooking class that I\u2019ve ever taken (well, I haven\u2019t taken that many, but they\u2019ve always used Kitchen Basics).  Not sure what happened to my onions, as they seem to be barely visible, but their flavor contributes greatly to that crazy-good gravy.  Some might say \u201c\u2026hey, this is just salisbury steak,\u201d but this turned out exceptionally well, that\u2019s why I\u2019m raving about it.  This one\u2019s going into my Favorites, definitely a \u201cmake-again\u201d recipe.",

The only changes I made were due to dietary restrictions (omitted egg used Ian's panko bread crumbs for Gluten Free Dairy Free and Egg free and subbed the red wine for marsala wine as that's what I had on hand). The patties held together perfectly and the flavor of the sauce with the mushrooms and onions was so spot on perfect for Salisbury Steak! Even my mushroom hater just pushed aside the mushrooms and said this dish was super good...not once but twice! Served with mashed sweet potatoes and to my surprise the sauce goes well...complimented and cut the sweetness of the potatoes nicely imo. My husband had some corn too. Perfect all around meal! Thanks for another great recipe Bren!",
