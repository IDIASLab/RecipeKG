I used oil (and only 1/4 cup) in place of margarine and unsweetened almond milk. They come together really quickly (especially if you use oil--you don't even have to heat it up in the microwave like you would with margarine) are easy to make and taste delicious! They also don't get overly browned when cooked but that doesn't affect the flavor any. They are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside--perfect to me! I topped them with sliced bananas and maple syrup. Great and easy recipe! Thank you!",
