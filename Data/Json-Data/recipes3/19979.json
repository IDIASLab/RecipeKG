I used a London broil as my meat; it was a very nice cut I might add! I did not use fresh parsley, all I had on had was dried, but it didn't matter, it was still great! I have put this in my personal cookbook! I just want to add to anyone who wants to try this, please remember this and make it a rule of thumb, my mother always told me, never cook with a wine that you wouldn't drink, because when the alcohol cooks off, all you have left is the flavor, so please, make sure you use a good wine. I recommend CK Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon. It is a great wine and reasonably priced.",

I have seen several comments about adding beef broth to replace some of the time wine.  Although, that may not be a bad idea I think it is important what type of red wine you use.  This recipe originally in France calls for a dark burgandy wine which cooks away nicely.  I love the deep rich flavor and would not advise a Chianti for instance or Zinfindel.",

I used a fantastic French burgundy (Louis Jadot for those who care) which I'm sure made all the difference. I never cook with a wine that I won't also have a glass of while cooking. My non-drinking wine-hating fiancee loved this meal and I loved that it was easy and made the house smell AMAZING. I would recommend going a little easy on the butter though especially if you have really good non-stick cookware and don't need it since the fat and the wine separated and was a tiny bit yucky to look at. Fantastic meal though and one I'll be making again and again. It's probably best saved for a weekend when you have lots of time for it to cook though. I made mine on a Tuesday night after work and we didn't eat dinner until 9 o'clock - oops!",

It originated with a type of burgundy wine hence the name! However I do think 2 cups red wine is a little much so I used 1 cup red wine and 1 can beef broth with mine. I also seasoned the beef with a little salt and pepper before adding the flour mixture to it. And also I didn't have canned onions so I just omitted it. It came out amazing! Love this recipe!",
