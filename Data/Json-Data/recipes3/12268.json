The texture is a bit hard after freezing overnight but if you manage to scoop some and let it rest a few minutes in your bowl it's wonderful. The flavor is seriously perfect. I made it with a mix of 70% and 85% chocolate and plan to try it with sugar-free chocolate next time. It's wonderfully rich and chocolatey with that hint of espresso that takes it up a notch. I used full-fat coconut milk suspecting it wouldn't taste nearly as good if I used light coconut milk. It needs the fat.",
