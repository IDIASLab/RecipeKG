                "reviewBody": "This is the easiest pie crust dough I have ever made or used.  Unlike some of the reviewers, I did not find this sticky at all, it rolled out easily and did not tear readily.  I used it for a pecan pie, and the only thing I did do differently was brush the floor of the pie crust with some egg white to make sure the bottom of the crust didn't become soupy after baking.  The crust was flaky and cut well.  I did use more than a \"pinch\" of salt (I used approx 1/8 teaspoon for a single crust).  This recipe is easy to reduce to 1 crust worth of dough.  Next time I plan on adding a little vanilla and 2-3 teaspoons of sugar for a fruit pie.  I absolutely love this recipe; it is now my \"go to\" pie crust recipe!  Addendum:  I think people may not be mixing this long enough and that's why it seems dry.  I cream my butter and cr. cheese and then mix in the flour and salt with my hand mixer and literally beat it for 3-4 mins - it will eventually turn from looking like bread crumbs to doughy in appearance.  It's at this point that you should stop and make a ball of dough.  It's not the least bit sticky and it's possible to roll it out immediately and not use wax paper - it rolls easily.  Don't let the reviews scare you away from this recipe - it's easy and is not sticky if you mix it long enough (and it's still flaky when I bake it).  Good luck!",
