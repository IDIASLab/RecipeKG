How can anyone make lasagna without baking it? Well, trust us - this one is well worth making. If you have a 6- or 7-inch springform pan and you kept the trivet that came with your Instant Pot&reg;, you can make a delicious layered lasagna pie in 30 minutes. And if you want to make it ahead, you can prep the lasagna, put it in the freezer, then put it right into the Instant Pot&reg; for an easy dinner.",

Based on the other reviewer and my own thoughts, I did use marinara instead of tomato sauce and I added 2 tsp Italian seasoning to the meat as it cooked. I used ricotta instead of goat cheese and added an egg to the cheese ( also some Romano cheese). I didn't have fresh spinach so I used thawed, frozen spinach which I mixed with the ricotta cheese. But...back to my rating. I am the first to admit that I have never made more than a passable lasagna until now. This was the best lasagna I've ever made. The texture was spot on. Soft, but firm and not at all sloppy gloppy. The only thing I will try differently the next time I make it will be to use 1/2 lb ground meat and 1/2 lb crumbled sausage.",
