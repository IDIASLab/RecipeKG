I used tomato basil linguine instead of fettucine as other reviewers stated it was bland. I also added some salt to the sauce and a very small amount of sherry (after tasting per recipe). With those changes we loved it. Oh I also used extra garlic (we love it) and less lemon zest. A very nice meal but a little rich. I will make it again though.",

I also found it wasn't \"saucy\" enough but rather dry. However something about it made me want to try it again so this time I used 2 huge cloves of garlic increased the cream and sour cream to 1 cup each and added a cup of fresh grated parmesan. It was better yet still not as flavourful as I had hoped. But my 2 young kids ate it without complaint and I enjoyed it enough to finish my plate. I'll probably make it again sometime maybe with smoked salmon instead of fresh and see if that adds to the flavour. Thanks for the recipe Annas!",
