                "reviewBody": "I used all of the ingredients listed (except i used 1 minced garlic clove instead of the garlic powder) but followed a different prep method. First I used frozen peeled and deveined shrimp so I didn't need to boil them first and then peel them. So with that in mind I sauteed the onion (red onion) in olive oil till soft then added garlic. I added the crushed tomatoes and parsley and let it simmer on high until most all the liquid had evaporated. I then added the raw defrosted shrimp and cooked them for 3 mins in the tomato sauce. I then added a cup of white wine. This is where I would alter the recipe - 1 cup is too much liquid to add at this point as while the end result was tasty it was too watery - this dish shouldn't be soupy and with 1 cup of wine added that was the consistency I got. So after adding the wine and letting it simmer for a minute I added the feta and transferred the skillet to an oven preheated to 400F. I cooked the dish for a further 5 to 7 mins till bubbly and the feta slightly browned on top. All in all the taste was delicious but next time I will just start with 1/2 cup of wine and add more if necessary. Served with crusty bread it made a great supper and was surprisingly easy to make! I am also thinking of using a few shots of ouzo next time instead of the wine. NOTE: I did not add any stock as the recipe calls for and I agree with the previous reviewer that one shouldn't add it otherwise this recipe would be for soup!!!!!",

I only used a portion of the stock, then added 1 1/2 Tbsp. of cornstarch to thicken up a bit. Most of the flavour came from the feta cheese . The next time I'd add chopped kalameta olives along with some greek seasoning and fresh chopped  tomatoes.   Recipe does have great potential.",
