                "reviewBody": "I agree with the other ratings.  This is a nice, healthy recipe, but it definitely has flavor components missing.  First, it needed more salt.   It is important to the flavor and texture of the slaw.  Replaced the lemon juice with lime juice for a more authetic flavor.  (Or try a combo or lemon, lime and orange juices.  Add a seeded and deveined jalepeno or two for more \"zip\".   Tthe missing key flavor was onion.  Add some finely chopped red or green onion.  (1/3-1/2 cup depending on how big the cabbage head is.)  It also needed a tablespoon of oil (olive or vegetable oil) to balance the slaw and give balance to the acids in the mixture.   Don't add the tomatoes until just before serving or they will be mushy.    Adding more salt, jalepeno and onion, substituting lime for lemon and adding a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil make the difference.  All in all, it is a pretty, healthy slaw.  I'd give it three and a half stars, but there is no 3.5, so four it is.",

I love it's simplicity because everytime I make it I'm using it as a topping for tacos that already have tons of flavor and spice. There's no need to pump it up with extra ingredients if you're serving it with seasoned meat. In my opinion it's simple fresh citrus flavor is just right to compliment any taco filling. Try it with Dee's Roast Pork For Tacos recipe and you'll understand what I'm talking about.",
