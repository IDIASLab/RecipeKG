I used boxed couscous with pinenuts and added some dried cranberries. I thought it was pretty good. I didn't add more couscous on top because I think it looks nicer with just the preserves. If I make again I'll smooth out the preserves with a little OJ. Another thing I better mention is that the recipe suggests to use a small dish but when I did that about halfway through the cooking time they were swimming in pork fat (yuck)... I had to transfer them out so the couscous wouldn't soak it up!",
