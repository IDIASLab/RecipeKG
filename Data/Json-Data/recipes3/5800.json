I can't understand why the previous rater didn't like it. Maybe the bell pepper/cranberry combo wasn't to their taste. I'm not too crazy for bell pepper either but in this recipe the bell pepper does not over-power the other flavors. We had to make the serving size for six people. It called for 1 1/2 cans of the whole cranberry sauce. We thought-what the heck- and put the other 1/2 can in the sauce. It was too runny but other than that it was great. My son is a quasi-vegitarian and even HE loved it.",

In a sauce pan combined the cranberry sauce garlic and vermouth. Poured it over the chicken and baked it at 375 for an hour. Was delicious. Next time am going to try sherry instead of vermouth. We loved this Cherokee chicken and will probably fix it about once a month. The cranberry sauce was homemade from Thanksgiving.",

My additions...fresh Rosemary a little cinnamon some red pepper flakes and a very little curry powder. Cooked on low for 7 hours.
