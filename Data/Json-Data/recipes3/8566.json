Ask your butcher to cut the roast for you and leave in the bones! (I asked for a four-bone roast. It cost a lot, but could serve 12-15 people.) Season with Montreal Steak rub. At 2 hours, 20 minutes, the roast reached 124 degrees. I removed it, covered with a foil tent and let it rest for 20 minutes. The internal temperature was 134 degrees just before I carved it. WOW! It was a nice, deep pink color. Cooked but not raw. I was so happy I did a couple of cartwheels around the kitchen. (Just kidding.) My neighbor came over to see what I was cooking and agreed it was perfectly seasoned and cooked. I would use this recipe again. I made the Jus, but the meat was so flavorful, it really wasn't needed. Just a sprinkle of French salt to finish it. Thank you Campbell's!",

I rinsed the roast, patted most of the water off and rubbed the outside  with dry Lipton Onion Soup mix. After skimming off most of the fat, the soup mix,  a little flour and water made a wonderful sauce to serve with the meat. Like others, I had the butcher cut off the bones and then tie them back on to be used in a soup later.  Very easy to slice! It turned out perfect. This is a great recipe for a beginner too because  if you follow the directions, you can't mess it up and will look like royalty when you present it to your in-laws!",
