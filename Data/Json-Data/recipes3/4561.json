Thanks for helping me make sure I was making mine right (and delicious). REVISED 8/27/09: STILL a great recipe. Made this last night into \"muffins\"...used 2 lbs. Ground Turkey...omitted the egg and added a can of Cr. of Chicken...used poultry seasoning \"to taste\"...kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Popped into muffin pans and baked an hour at 350. Note: Don't worry that the recipe is extremely moist before baking...that's the payoff...cripsy on the outside tender and moist on the inside.",
