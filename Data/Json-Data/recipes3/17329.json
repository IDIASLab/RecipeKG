Fresh bean sprouts were not available and I had to resort to can which is a shame because fresh would have added a nice crunch. These were different and a nice change of pace. The one recommendation I have is to heat your tortilla's on the stove so you get that toasted tasted instead of heating them up in the microwave.",

So the 2nd time I used sirloin and sliced it thin across the grain. I marinaded it in the Awesome Korean steak marinade from AllRecipes: \n \nI didn't have the Japanese Mirin so I made it with: Sherry, Marsala, Dry white wine, sesame oil, rice vinegar, white sugar, soy sauce + splash of orange juice and 4 squirts of honey. You MUST adjust and taste the Korean marinade to get the right balance of sweet and savory. \nI marinated the steak for about 2 hours turning once. I dredged it in flour and shook excess off. Then I flash fried it in a bit of vegetable oil and drained on paper towel. The meat turned out \"melt-in-your-mouth wonderful. My daughter wouldn't stop eating it. Everything else in the original I kept the same. All in all this is a very good recipe I will continue making.",
