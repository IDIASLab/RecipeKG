I had to change it a bit since I didn't have agave (used honey) or champagne vinegar (used red wine vinegar) but I think the biggest problem I have with it is the amount of truffle oil. I love truffle oil but it's overpowering in this dish. I think a sesame oil would be a better bet for this salad.",
