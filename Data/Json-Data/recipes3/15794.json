I had half a zucchini in the fridge, so I scaled this recipe down to 8 servings to use it up.  Baked for 32 minutes @ 350\u00baF in a 6-1/2\u201dx8-1/2\u201d baking dish.  It ceases to amaze me what shredded zucchini brings to baked goods.  Nobody, NOBODY ever knows there\u2019s zucchini in there.  Don\u2019t tell the \u201czucchini haters\u201d because they\u2019ll never know.  I used all purpose and white whole wheat flours, and this cake baked up beautifully moist and tender, perfect texture.  Might just add a little more carrot next time because that layer of flavor is subtle.  This was very good, thoroughly enjoyed it.",

I doubled the cinnamon, & used macadamia nuts, as I was out of walnuts-still awesome! \"One large zucchini\" is a little vague (I've grown some LARGE zucchinis!); I had 2 smallish but fat  zucchinis & thought I'd just use those but after grating one, I was afraid the second one would be too much.  It was about 2-ish cups worth. Same with the carrot, tho not as essential to the end product.  I will definitely make this again!",
