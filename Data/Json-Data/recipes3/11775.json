Linguine is a sorry substitute for 'reshte,' the traditional noodles used in this dish. The reshte is featured in its name. Now, I really don't want to debate the practical purposes of using Italian pasta, fine if that's what you like, but it is never going to taste as perfect as with reshte. And in an ever increasingly cosmopolitan world, you owe it to yourself to eat the dish in its authentic, more aromatic and lighter original version with reshte.",
