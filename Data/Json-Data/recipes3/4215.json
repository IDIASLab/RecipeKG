However I read over the reviews just before eating it this time and noticed something: this meal has anti-flavor. There's something strange about it: normally when I add spices to plain food the spices determines the flavor. In this recipe the plain dominates. It's hard to taste even the avocado unless I really try. I don't know why... perhaps it's the dressing? Next time I might try using store-bought Italian dressing in place of the olive oil and rice vinegar. Notes: I added garlic powder and yellow bell pepper and omitted tomato slices. Also my rice vinegar was not seasoned. The fresh parsley is an important component of the flavor -- dried isn't nearly as flavorful.",
