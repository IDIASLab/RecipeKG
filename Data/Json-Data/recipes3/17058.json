Add a little cocoa powder or melted chocolate, to taste, for Chocolate Cream Cheese frosting.",

I made a basic white cake with strawberry preserves between each layer frosted with this frosting for my husband for Father's Day.  I served fresh maserated berries on the side.  Excellent!

I like this one.  I, like some other review varied the powerded sugar.  Since I wanted my frosting \"stiff\" I used more sugar, which was great.  For those who want to frost the entire cake, (I am a former professional cake decorator) here at some hints for ALL cakes.  Freeze the cake.  Use the frosting between layer and cover the entire care with a thin coat of frosting. (This way the crumbs are only in the coat and it acts as a seal on the cake.  Once again freeze or refrigerate, and then put on the final layer of frosting.  This way you won't pull the crumbs into the frosting and it looks fabulous.",

The biggest problem I had was the frosting LITERALLY ran right off the cake as soon as it reached room temperature. This caused the top layer of cake to slide about three inches to the right. Once re-refrigerated, it was fine and hardened right up. Sorry, this one just wasn't for me.",

I also added about a cup of chopped nuts for more of a tropical flavor.  I spread this on top of a Mexican Wedding Cake while it was still warm (my mema's recipe) and wow...soooo good.  Thanks JJ",
