My test cookie didn t flatten much so the rest of them I flattened a bit before baking. Not very sweet so if you like sweet cookies you might want to up the sugar (unless the low sweetness was due to my use of monk fruit but I won t think so.) As is I d say it s an adult cookie a unique but pleasant flavour. Good texture hold together well.",
