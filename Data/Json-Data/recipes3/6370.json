The raw grated potato is supposed to give this some texture so that was alright but the result was just bland and uninteresting IMO. For my actual meal I used leftover mashed potatos which had been cooked in salted water and mashed with butter and milk. I had cooked extra knowing I would use the rest for Boxty. I added 2 grated medium red potatoes 1 cup of AP flour 1 tsp baking soda and 3 tbs of reserved bacon drippings and enough milk to make a pourable batter. This was then cooked in a cast iron skillet which I had lightly greased.",

I felt like I had added a LOT of salt and pepper but they still needed more. Also the raw potato doesn't get cooked very well so I might adapt the recipe next time by par-cooking the shredded potato before mixing it with the other ingredients. Other than that the flavor was good. I too \"baked\" my potatoes in the microwave instead of the oven to save time. I had to use a buttermilk substitute (milk vinegar) so I'd like to try them with real buttermilk next time. I served them topped with sour cream and a little shredded cheddar cheese.",

I substituted milk and vinegar for the buttermilk and I cut the recipe in half. I used a 1/4 cup measure to make 7 patties. I cooked each side 5 minutes as the recipe stated. I tried them with just butter then with butter and honey and finally with grated cheese. I prefer the ones with cheese.

I used the powdered buttermilk I thought they were really soupy but they cooked up ok. Used 2 medium size potatoes for each set of potatoes. I thought they tasted pretty gummy and floury but as I said maybe I was expecting more. They did taste better with a little sour cream and some butter and/or cheese would be good.
