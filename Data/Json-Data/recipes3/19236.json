Doubled the stuffing (on top) and added some basil (made presentation nicer with the green flecks and added a little more flavor). LOVED IT. The whole meal in ONE DISH! Mine took longer than recipe stated (to get chicken to done temperature-65 minutes). I will try baking at 375 degrees next time-seems to me it would be quicker and just as good.  I used a white Merlot wine. My family thought the wine was a little too strong-I will use (just a little)less next time or maybe a different kind. Also, this would be great for company-as you don't have to \"babysit\" it. There WILL be a next time for this one... Thanks, Darlene.",

Easy to prepare, and good enough for company.",

I used four cans of cream of chicken for more sauce but used 3/4 cups of white wine.  Also used 3 boxes of Stouffers Savory Herb dressing which I prepared before adding to the pan.  Doubled the cheese as well.  Covered the pan with foil while baking.  Can uncover for last 10-15 mins if you want dressing crispier.  Excellent taste for such little preparation!!!",

I just wanted to say that I wish people wouldn't knock down the stars on a recipe (for instance see review on July 1 by bpmj) when they didn't make the recipe. I really depend on the star ratings and it's frustrating when somebody essentially makes a different dish and then leaves less than 5 stars. I've wanted to say this so many times while reading reviews on this site. I just do not understand why so many people do this. If you didn't make the recipe shown here why review it at all? What's the point? You changed it completely then weren't wild about YOUR dish and then leave a less than great review? Why? The next Day: My review - as we've now eaten the meal - it was wonderful! The wine added such a lovely taste when you were expecting more plain crunch from the stuffing.This is absolutely on my \"do it again\" list! My husband also loved it and wanted to know I'd really start one of those weekly menus where every one knows Sunday is Roast Beef night and Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti night. That's not happening. We ate this with plain old Pennsylvania Noodles corn on the cob and some sliced up thin patty pan & sliced round zucchini squash that had been marinated a short time (1/2 hour maybe)and then cooked along in a pan along side the chicken. Everything was so good! I should have taken a photo but we were starving. Thank you Darlene!!",
