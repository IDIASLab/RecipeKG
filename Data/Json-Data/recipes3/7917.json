I used rosemary paprika and red pepper roasted chicken. I thought I wouldn't care for the raisins but they were perfect- salty and sweet. The salad would be still be great without the chicken. This reminds me of the salads served at an upscale restaurant where I used to work. Greens fruit chicken or fish cheese a sweet and tangy vinaigrette and nuts all combined perfectly to make so many delicous salads!",
