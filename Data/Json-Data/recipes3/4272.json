                "reviewBody": "Lovely, earthy flavor to these muffins, due to the molasses. This recipe is less sweet than most, because there is no sweetening other than the molasses. For those who don't appreciate a strong molasses flavor, consider using half dark corn syrup or honey to replace half of the molasses called for. But leave in at least half for the subtle flavor contribution and deep color. If you like a sweeter muffin, add 2 Tb sugar, either brown or white. For those who had trouble with a runny batter, allow the bran to soak in the milk for 10 minutes before mixing. I used sour milk and cut the soda back to 1 tsp, which is sufficient for a recipe of this size. 1-1/2 tsp, particularly if you use fresh milk (as opposed to buttermilk or sour milk) could be contributing to the off-flavor some have reported. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, because I just like it in my muffins. I brushed the tops with a drop of honey as they came out of the oven, adding a slight punch of sweetness and a beautiful sheen. Already ate one fresh from the oven, and it was stellar! Be aware that these do not rise very much. What you see when you spoon the batter into the muffin tins is pretty much what you get coming out of the oven. So don't be afraid to fill nearly to the top. It made 12 very full muffins. All in all, an excellent recipe! Edited 10/14/08 to add that these are excellent keepers. Four days after baking, they are still remarkably  moist, almost as good as freshly baked. A+",

I did change it up the 2nd time around to create a low fat muffin. I used sugar free instant flavored oatmeal instead of the bran no additional sugar needed but if you wanted to you could sub it for splenda. And instead of using 2 tbl spoons of oil I used 1 tbl sp oil and 3 tbl spoons of applesauce. The muffins tastes better hot. And each muffin comes out to 3 grams of fat and 92 calories. 2 muffins a day for a week brings your iron back up and your energy as well. And it also helps with those who have IBS like myself.",
