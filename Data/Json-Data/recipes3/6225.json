This can be made ahead and stored in 200 degree oven until the rest of the meal is ready. For those of you who like less spicy, remove the seeds of the chipotle or cut down to one pepper and one tablespoon of adobo sauce. You can always add more later.",

Per another review I used only 1 Tbs. butter. You can also cut the fat by using evaporated milk. Sooo good. Find the chipotles in the Mexican section of your market. The leftover chilies can be placed in Ziploc squeeze out air and put in freezer for another use. They are great in homemade salsa too.",

I was in a hurry so nuked the sweet potato before mashing and baking but I do like the taste better of potatoes cooked in the oven so will do that next time. Also I like really spicy food so added extra chipotle. I almost always have sweet potatoes around and since I froze the remaining chipotles in seperate containers I can whip this up on a whim. Will definitely add this to the side dish rotation.",
