Traditional chicken fried steak uses top round or bottom round steak, sometimes cube steaks, and is always served with cream gravy, mashed potatoes or rice, and turnip greens (I prefer fresh spinach cooked).  Some people used a combination of beef broth and milk in the cream gravy, but the traditional cream gravy uses only milk and is well peppered and salted.",

Tonight I used a can of cream of mushroom soup for my quickie gravy. Cooked in one of my trusty cast iron skillets made this a lip smacker with no leftovers. Thank you!",

My daughter her boyfriend and his parents were headed back from Six Flags last night and while on the phone I asked my daughter what \"Arnie\" wanted for dinner Sunday night. He proclaimed \"Chicken Fried Steak\"! I've made it before but wanted to find a different recipe and I'm so glad I did. It was a huge hit for he's the pickiest twenty year old I've ever met. In my flour mixture I used garlic and onion powders paprika salt and pepper and a bit of cayenne. If it wasn't for the fact that he also requested fetticini alfredo (low fat dinner right?) I would have used some of the drippings to make a gravy. After coating the cube steaks I used for this dish I let it sit for about ten minutes and had no problem with the breading falling off while frying. Thanks again Virginia for a great recipe!!",

I scaled the recipe down to two servings and mixed 2 teaspoons of garlic powder a teaspoon of onion powder 1/2 teaspoon salt and a dash each of paprika and cayenne pepper into the flour before breading. Instead of frying in oil I liberally coated the pan with olive oil cooking spray and I used steak instead of veal. I cooked each steak for four minutes on each side and that was perfect. My husband was thrilled. The only problem was that I forgot that I wouldn't be able to make gravy without the oil and the steaks would have been best with a gravy of some sort.",
