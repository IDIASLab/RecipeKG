We are used to spices- not terribly hot chili spice (he's actually very sensitive to chilis) but just lots of cumin coriander turmeric ginger etc. But when I made this recipe even though I added twice the stated amounts of each spice (as Manisha said the spices could be increased and I knew the amounts were very small for our tastes) AND I added chopped fresh coriander it was still disappointingly bland. I also used about 1/2 of the recommended oil. I gave the recipe 2 stars because it still has some of the basic ingredients for a good okra dish and it may be good in a pinch (when you're not in the mood to chop/measure out a bunch of ingredients).",
