                "reviewBody": "2.8.19 Sadly this recipe has convinced me to never try making meringues again because this was a disaster. I followed the instructions to the letter and ended up with a bowl of runny/soupy egg white-cocoa. No sense in even attempting to drop this onto a baking sheet because it would have just puddled into a runny mess. I thought maybe more confectioners sugar would thicken it up a bit so I started gradually with 1/4 cup sugar another 1/4 cup another 1/4 cup and finally two additional tablespoons to no avail then stopped! Since I d added so much additional sugar I did add about a tablespoon more of the cocoa powder so as not to lose the cocoa flavor. Well the consistency still wasn t even close to stiff so I added a bit of cream of tartar but that didn t help either. My best effort resulted in meringue patties but I went ahead and put the patties into the oven and took them out 1-1/2 hours later And that brings me to another point how can you have a recipe that has a baking time of 1 to 2 hours WHAT? This recipe looks like it was tweaked from Authentic French Meringues on this site with cocoa being added to this recipe. If you decide to make this I would recommend adding vanilla because all I could taste was the confectioners sugar. Also if you use parchment paper you dont need to butter and flour the pan. Not sure what went wrong here but I WILL NOT be making this again",

Then I impatiently tried to bake them at a higher temp for a shorter time as I have with other meringues - 250 for 45 min - and the outsides are beautiful but the inside not fully cooked. They are delicious nonetheless and far smoother in appearance than meringues I've made with granulated sugar. I'll definitely be making these again!",
