I made a few substitutions:  \r\nshredded mozzarella for slices,1/4 c. butter instead of 1/2 c., italian bread crumbs, and chicken broth for white wine.  Still came out wonderful.  I baked it for the full 45 minutes for a crunchier coating.  Also, I used unwaxed dental floss instead of toothpicks.  Will make again and again!",

Instead of pounding chicken breasts, I always slice chicken horizontally to make two thinner breasts, which makes double the number of roll-ups.

The pounding and rolling up of the chicken was a bit messy and troublesome- maybe next time I'll just cut each breast in half thickness-wise, and put the cheese in the middle. Also, the bread crumbs got a bit soggy from baking in the \"sauce\"- maybe next time I will fry them in some oil to crisp it up a little, and possible use a different sauce to bake them in. But the cheese inside was delicious! (PS I substituted chicken broth for the wine).",
