Peeling and cutting beets is so much easier when they\u2019re tender after roasting, so don\u2019t even think about peeling before roasting.  Golden beets are sweeter than red, and they're just about the only beets I buy now.  They\u2019re getting easier to find locally, so I\u2019m buying them more often.  I had some golden beets on hand, and my plans were to turn them into a dinner side dish, but when I saw this recipe, just knew I had to make a traditional golden beet salad.  And I\u2019m so glad I did.  I just topped my greens with the sliced beets that were infused with that tasty dressing, garnished with some feta cheese and pomegranate arils, and enjoyed a really nice salad for lunch today.  The dressing has a nice balance of sweet-tart and infused lots of flavor into the roasted beets.  Next time, think I\u2019ll try white balsamic vinegar which should lighten the color of the beets a little (presentation thing only, no big deal).  Thanks for sharing your recipe, will be making this recipe again for sure!",
