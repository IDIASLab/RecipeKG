My recipe is a bit different--I use almonds (very finely chopped), and 1/4 c regular sugar for the mix.  (My recipe doesn't call for vanilla bean).  I bake at a low temp (300) for about 30 minutes.  The cookies should be rolled in powdered sugar twice--the first roll does absorb, but the second stays white and fluffy.  I use a plastic bag in a bowl filled with the powdered sugar for easier rolling.  My brother used to call these \"fuzzy cookies\".  A great cookie no matter!",

For the chocolate use Belgian Chocolate instead of chocolate chips a world of difference.",
