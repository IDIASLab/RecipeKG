Also, I used freshly ground \"Medley Peppercorns\" and 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic for a litte extra pizzaz.",

I think they added color and a bit more flavor without overwhelming the dish.  If you love cilantro and shrimp, fix this!",

Used 1T. chopped garlic in olive oil.  Served over buttered, garlic pasta (noodles) and garlic bread.  Instead of sprinkling pepper and lemon juice on top, sprinkling w/parmesan cheese.  Great flavor do recommend this recipe to others.  Will make again.",
