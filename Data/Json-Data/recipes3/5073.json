I scaled it down for 2 servings; combined 1% milk and quick oats in the microwave on high for 2 minutes added the maple syrup and fruit returned to microwave for 1 more minute and then added the walnuts and coconut. It was perfectly sweet without the added honey. I love the combination of walnuts and coconut which gives this oatmeal just the right amount of interest and pleasant crunch. Next time I am going to try it with steel cuts as I prefer them over regular. Thanks for a great recipe.",
