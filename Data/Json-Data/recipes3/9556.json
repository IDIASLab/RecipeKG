I pretty much followed the recipe.. but did make these changes: used 1 lb of gr. venison and 1 lb gr. wild boar as that is what the butcher stocks in packaged 1 lb portions. I used 1 lb sliced mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and kept it out of the meat mixture - using it to top the burgers. Did not do the butter-thing to the buns just toasted them in the toaster. This made enough patties for 3 dinner meals for us. My family thoroughly enjoyed these burgers! This is definitely being added to our monthly dinner rotation!",
