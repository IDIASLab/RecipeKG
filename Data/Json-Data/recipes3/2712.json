I tried this as a recipe for my husband who loves broccoli and cheese in return i found and easy and quick recipe that every one loves. One thing to keep in mind is that this recipe uses a lot of oil so make sure you have adaquete room to drain. I used a cooking cooling rack. Places napkins on the rack and below and served on a plate with multi colored napkins to brighten up a bit green and yellow do the trick:) Michelle",
