Defienately do all the prep work before you begin frying.\nFor the seasoning part, instead of using a shallow dish, I put my seasoning in a shaker for an even distribute of flavor. And then, instead of a shallow dish for the flour, I used a produce bag from the market or grocery store. With a generous amount of flour in it, I'd add one by one each of my seasoned salmon to the bag, twist and wrap around my finger. With the air trapped inside, I used that to shake the contents. This works very effectively.\nI added cilantro to the Chipotle Chilie sauce after tasting it. I love cilantro and felt my sauce needed it.\nThis dinner was exactly what I wanted for Taco Tuesday.\nWe will be eating this dinner often. Definitely!",
