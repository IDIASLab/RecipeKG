Our friend's mom takes food to families who have suffered a death in the family.  They take all sorts of things but this always goes first. It is tasty. She uses kielbasa but we use brats.

I made a few changes: I used one bottle of beer instead of water I added garlic to the onion sautee and I added a chipotle seasoning as other reviewers said it needed something. I also cooked it covered since it didn't seem to be cooking the brats well with the lid off. I would make it again we are a family that loves brats and we're always looking for something a little different!",
