        "description": "Ahh, 'Vina Dosh,' a Portuguese dish and tradition of my family during Christmas. It started getting passed down more than 80 years ago when my grandparents came to America from the Azore Islands! Easy to make, but lots of patience to wait for the marinade to make its magic. But, oh so worth the wait! As it was passed down to me, I share it with you. Serve with Portuguese Linguica, a pot of semi-sweet, bacon-laced baked beans, and some Portuguese sweet bread. Hawaiian sweet bread works in a pinch. You can use white wine or red wine in the marinade.",

His father would use Vina Dosh marinade for rabbit and chicken. Unfortunately he passed away and so did the recipe. When I tried this and my husband ate it, he was so happy. He said it is as close as I could possibly get, I am sure a different wine would make a different taste, but this is the real deal. THANK YOU SO MUCH CALI-CHEF. Also, I have a portuguese beans recipe I submitted that will be perfect with these, if Allrecipes doesn't post it, find it on justapinch.com Thanks again !",

The only exception that I made was adding some Hawaiian salt. Marinated those steaks for 4 days and grilled them on the outdoor barbecue. The result was CHRISTMAS IN APRIL!! Thank you for sharing your version! By the way some people call this Vengadalsh too. Depends on where the Portuguese grandmother was raised. Thanks again!",
