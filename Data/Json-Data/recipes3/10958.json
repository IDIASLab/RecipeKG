Maybe drop the temp?\" I think in the end we'll always prefer a simple steamed broccoli w/ butter salt and a lemon squeeze but roasting is a nice change and we squabble over the pieces that are the brownest b/c they're the best. But w/ this recipe where some pieces were browned nicely at 20 min. others remained squishy and the garlic was a little burny. Maybe a lower temperature and stirring more frequently would even everything out. Ohh I had a lonely squash that needed to be eaten so I added slices of that too nothing remarkable just yellow alongside the green broccoli and we ate it w/ mashed potatoes and AR's \"Mark's Surprise Meatloaf.\"",
