As a meat tenderizer you couldn't have better - before marinating I had two pretty tough cuts of beef but by the time they were on the plates the knife went through them like soft butter. I marinated them for about 2 1/2 hours and then poured the leftover juices into the pan to bubble right along with the meat for about 5 minutes and I think it made the difference in sealing the flavor. I wasn't real wild about trying this recipe (I HATE beer) but I think this one's a winner! Next time I may attempt it with garlic cloves and onion powder. A keeper!",

I used garlic pepper, better for beef than lemon pepper. I added Montreal steak seasoning. I made tracks in rae steak with fork. I then rubbed the spices into it. The tracks help retain the spices. I poured the beer over it slowly. I didn't lose my spices this way. (My grandma thought me that trick.)",
