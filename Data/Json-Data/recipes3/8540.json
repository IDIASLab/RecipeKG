(Get your fresh halibut now! The new season has just begun!)  So I knew this recipe would be a sure thing, not likely to disappoint us.  And it didn\u2019t.   It is a true gem and I know I will return to it often; not something I generally say about ANY recipe.  After drying the filets I rubbed them lightly with olive oil, then salted and peppered them.  I did not add salt to the topping, nor did I measure the olive oil, just added enough so the panko crumbs were lightly coated.  Duncan, you have outdone yourself.  This is a fresh tasting dish that allows the flavor of the beautiful halibut to shine.  No heavy seasonings, no heavy, rich sauce.  Excellent, especially served with a wild rice pilaf.",
