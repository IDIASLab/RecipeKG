Fixing gravy this way will always prevent lumps. Flour has to be cooked a bit before adding to a hot mixture. Cornstarch doesn't.",

I added a little Italian seasoning to the chicken with the salt pepper and flour and although I made it scaled it to one i minced a whole clove of garlic. (okay not exactly made as the recipe said). If you added lemon juice it would be close to chicken piccata! It was easy and had that rich taste that I think chicken broth brings. Next time i will flour the chicken more so it browns more and serve it over rice. And yes i used more flour than the recipe called for. All in all i really liked it and i will make it again for sure!",
