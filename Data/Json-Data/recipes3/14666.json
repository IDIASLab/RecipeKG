Instead of chocolate protein powder, I used vanilla protein powder mixed with cacao powder and I think that it worked really well. I also didn't have any coconut extract so I used vanilla extract. When I rolled the balls out, I did not put any cocoa powder on the outside and instead of making 30 one inch balls, it made about 60. I also used sweetened coconut flakes because I ran out of unsweetened coconut flakes. Last, I used pumpkin seeds that I broke up with a mortar and pestle instead of flax seeds. Even with these adjustments I found that they still turned out really well and are very worth making.",
