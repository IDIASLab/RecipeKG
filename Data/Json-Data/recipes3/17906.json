We would use a meat grinder to grind the ham.  Now, a food processor works nicely and saves time.  I process the egg whites and save the cooked yokes.  The yokes are mashed and mixed with the mustard and mayo and then mixed into the ham mixture. (I also start with a smaller amount of these ingredients, so the ham salad is not overly moist.  One can always add a little more to reach the desired consistency)  We serve it between two slices of toast with a couple leaves of lettuce.  Chilling it prior to serving is best, giving the individual flavors time to blend together.  Be sure to refrigerate the leftovers.",

I was also careful to choose an \"upscale\" ham to begin with.  \nI served this as part of a holiday buffet with mini-rye breads and crackers, and it went largely ignored, although people who tried it, liked it, but did not rave as they did over other items on the buffet.  My husband does love the recipe for sandwiches -  a good thing because we had lots leftover.  \nWhy three stars - I don't think you should have to change a recipe from its original, and if sev Still looking for the perfect ham salad, like MY mother used to make it!",
