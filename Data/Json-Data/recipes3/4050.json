The tomatoes I used had Italian spices added already. Instead of goat cheese I used Boursin gourney cheese with herbs which is what I had on hand. When it melted along with the sauce it tasted very much like La Madeleine's tomato basil soup with chunky veggies in it of course. I served it over whole grain rotini pasta. Even my husband liked it a lot even though there wasn't any meat in it. Thanks for the recipe!",
