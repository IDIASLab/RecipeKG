I think the whipping cream may have had something to do with it...I don't know. And 9 eggs is just too many. I think I'm going to stick with my old tried and true recipe. 3/4 C. of flour 1 T. of sugar 3 eggs 3/4 C. of good old fashioned milk and 2 T. butter melted in a 10\" Oven-Proof Skillet at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes.",
