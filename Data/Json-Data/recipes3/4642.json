I used 3/4 teaspoon of cajun seasoning instead of salt, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. Tasted great the next day warmed and served on plain crackers. I could have eaten a plateful!

I made as directed with the exception of adding a bit of sauted fresh chopped spinach and small amount of red pepper for some color. I served this DELISHIOUS recipe in phllo dough cups which I made in my muffin tin along side a beautiful med rare ribeye steak which I blackened prior to grilling. The combination of the richness of the lobster newburg and the heat of the blackened steak was a definate winner!!!  Will most definately make again and play around with the versatility of ways to serve this recipe.  Next timme I am considering incorporating crab and scallops and tripling the sauce and making a nice seafood lasagna........Oh My...  I am so drooling on my keyboard!!!!!! LOL!",
