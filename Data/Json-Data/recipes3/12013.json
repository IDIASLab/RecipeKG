Overall it tasted good but the smell when I added the fish sauce was soooo nasty and it just permeated throughout the house. And even when eating it you could still smell the fishy smell. Just for reference I like anchovies which is what fish sauce is mostly made out of so I can\u2019t explain why I found it so foul smelling. I did use slightly less fish sauce then the recipe called for and if I make it again I will use about half the amount and see if that makes a difference.  So I gave the recipe 4 stars because it did taste good (very flavorful) but I just don\u2019t know if I could make it again. If I add the experience of the smell it\u2019s more like a 2 star.",

Cut back on the lime and fish sauce a wee bit.  Added a bit more mint b/c I think it freshens the dish.  Again, overall, good and easy.  Served it with kow neow - sticky rice - the way it's meant to be!  But if you're low carb, it certainly will work with lettuce!",
