They cooked quickly because of being cubes so I took them out and put in the veggies to saute a little (10 minutes) before adding the white wine and chicken back in. I left it on med. high to high so it would cook down then after about 15 minutes added in a little cornstarch I had mixed with water so it would be more saucy. I put the tomatos (only two romas) and parsley in last minute and cooked for another 3 minutes with the lid on. The dish was spicy full of flavor and a complete meal when served over rice. It's easy too -gotta love that.",

Instead of using olive oil in the pan we just cooked the chicken in the Italian dressing it was marinating in (Paul Newman's). More specifics are we didn't use blackening spice. Instead we used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning and our white wine was Prosecco. Also used red and orange bell peppers (it's a prettier dish that way). Don't put parmesan on top and I could deal without the tomatoes as they just become lukewarm and mushy on top. Great dish.",
