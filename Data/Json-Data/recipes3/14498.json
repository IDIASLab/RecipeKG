If you\u2019re looking for family friendly keto recipes, this is it. Some people mentioned it was a little runny or thin and I\u2019ve found that the leftovers are actually better because it has time to \u201cset up\u201d. We ate it for dinner and I added a handful of shredded cheese in the pot to thicken it up a bit and add some more flavor and that made a huge difference. We are now eating it for lunch  and it definitely seems thicker today. I added some sour cream to my one year old\u2019s to tone down the mild spice for her. Overall we loved it with just those couple adjustments!",
