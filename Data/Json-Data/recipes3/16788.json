I ended up using 2 chilis, 3 cloves of garlic, and a 1-inch segment of ginger and just dumping it all in instead of using a teaspoon, and I think that was the right call. Overall, pretty  delicious.",

I had zero kick back from this recipe.  I changed a few ingredients because of what I had available in the house.  I used mostly thawed mixed veggies that I had on hand ... it was delish!!!! A no brainer recipe!  It will be a staple at my house....kind of the way meatloaf was when I was growing up!",

I found this about 3 years ago when I went vegan and have made it countless times since then. IT. IS. PHENOMENAL. The only changes I make is doubling all of the spices (yes even the cayenne - I like my heat!) and adding mushrooms! It\u2019s SO flavorful and delicious and comforting! It is absolutely my go-to recipe! I cook a pot of rice as well to go along with this, and I\u2019ve even made homemade naan - spectacular with this recipe! I have shared it with many vegans and non-vegans alike, and everyone raves about this curry! Thank you for the splendid addition to my recipe book and tummy :)",
