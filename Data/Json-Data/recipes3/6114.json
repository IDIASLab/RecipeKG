I felt the tomato sauce and feta would overpower the diverse flavors of the arugula cauliflower garlic and olives so I left it out completely. I added a tablespoon of diced sundried tomatoes and served with parmesan. It was surprising how well this unlikely combination of ingredients melded together in taste. I'll keep this recipe on hand for when I'm in the mood to change up from the standard pasta tomato or cream-based sauce.",

I had to eliminate some of the ingredients cause I didn't have them on hand but the basic penne cauliflower (and broccoli I added) spinach and cheese combo was awesome. I left out the tomatoes although my sister added some sauce to hers and liked it. If I had the olives and pepper it would have been even better. Oh I added a can of cannelinni beans too.
