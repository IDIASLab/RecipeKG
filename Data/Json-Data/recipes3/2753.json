I used 28oz. can Contadina crushed tomatoes in puree. Omitted onion soup. Used 1/2tsp garlic powder,1/4 tsp onion powder. Franks red hot sauce & one half of a pound loaf velveeta. Used rest ing. as listd. If you use Velveeta becareful W/ adding additional salt. I put sauce ing. in bowl so I could adjust flavors,then added to meat untill cheese melted. Pored into 3 qt. oblong dish and slowly added pasta. Bake as directed. It came out creamy and not dry at all. Delish! Thanks Rhonda!",

Also added bread crumbs to the cheese topping.  Everyone loved it and ate and ate until there was no more.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks!",

I also diced up some green bell pepper and added it to the frying meat. This is a good basic recipe that's easy to modify to suit your needs.",

                "reviewBody": "I thought this recipe turned out good. This is a recipe where you can make a few changes to suite your preferences and it wouldn't matter that much so thats what I did. When browning the meat i added peppers to it. Depending on your taste you could either use hot green or whatever kind of pepper you like. INstead of using garlic powder I diced up a few garlic cloves and put that in with the meat and peppers. We think fresh garlic gives it food a better flavor. I used rotini noodles and they worked really well. I read how the other users said it was a little dry so instead of using a small can of tomatoes i used a 28 oz can. I used about three fourths of it and saved the rest to top it when we ate it. Next time i make it I would definitely use the whole big can. This is also a good recipe to make if say you don't have time to cook like me on that particular day. I made it that morning everything but tossing it in the oven and when people were ready to eat while i was at work all they had to do was toss it in the oven and put cheese on it presto they have a hot meal in half an hour. Its not the best meal ever but it is a really good quick family meal. We used leftover sour cream tomatoes and cheese to top it before we ate it. The last change I made was hot sauce i wanted to add hot sauce to it before it was baked but i forgot to so we just added it to our portions as we ate it. If you like spicy things it added a really good flavor.",
