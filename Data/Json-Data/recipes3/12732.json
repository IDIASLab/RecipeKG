I could not find the herb and jack cheese so I used half pepper jack and half colby jack (half a slice per burger) went great with some mac and cheese.

I had never heard of garlic herb cheese before and was excited to try something new on my burgers. I had some frozen roll dough that I baked up for the buns. Prior to grilling the buns I brushed with melted butter instead of using the spray and sprinkled with garlic powder. I also used the butter on the veggies before grilling. When I think of slider I think little but these \"little\" gems were far from little. Even though it is a 4 oz. burger they're quite large. I'm not a huge fan of warm tomatoes but decided to try the recipe as is. The warm kind of \"mushy\" tomato was a delicious addition to this burger no need for ketchup and much fresher tasting. The method for cooking the onion is spot on not crunch and not mushy just perfect. Love the gooey 'hidden\" cheese in this. I made one without bun for me and hubby gets the buns! Good either way! And the grill marks! Love the grill marks! Cook time was spot on all the way around! Great job Cliff!",

To the meat mixture I like to add a tiny bit of water to keep them moist and make them easier to work with. I couldn't find garlic and herb pepper Jack so I had the deli thinly slice me some garlic cheddar and pepper jack cheese separately. I cut each slice into quarters and paired them one with each. Heirloom tomatoes didn't look great either so I bought mini orange and yellow tomatoes instead. I used olive oil and salt and pepper to season the tomatoes and onions instead of cooking spray and I added 2 minutes to the onions after flipping them. I used Hawaiian rolls and brushed some butter on them before cooking them. When I assembled them I added some sriracha mustard to each mini burger. These turned out fabulous! The Panasonic oven makes these so easy to put together.",
