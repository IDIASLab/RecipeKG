After all, who eats PLAIN cheeseburgers? (My little cousin, but that's besides the point.) I dressed this as I would my regular burgers. Layers were: hamburger (seasoned with garlic and onion powder), crumbled bacon, raw onions (mm, crunchy), chopped dill pickles (trust me), cheese, homemade buttermilk biscuit (dough that I had in the fridge). When it was cooked, I plated it on top of whole leaf lettuce, would have added tomatoes if I had 'em, and thousand island dressing. It was tasty, casserole-y, and cheeseburger-y. Get out there and experiment. Recipes are not set in stone. (Unless it is creme brulee, I'm pretty sure that's set in stone somewhere... in France.) Thanks for a good start to a decent supper. ",

I should have used a little salt, although I don't salt anything any more. I whisked the Bisquick with milk & eggs & it was very runny. Finished dish was a little bland, improved with ketchup &, while the Bisquick did creep into all the nooks & crannies, it tasted under-cooked. The second time I made this I cut the milk to 1/3 C. & added 3 eggs. I also placed 1/2 ground beef in pie pan, added the cheese then remaining meat. Baked it for 20 minutes, added more cheese to the top & returned it to oven to finish. I also added salt this time. Perfection! This is now in my permanent rotation of meals.",
