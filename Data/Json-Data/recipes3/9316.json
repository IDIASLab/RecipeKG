Mostly because I am not sure what century I put them into the pantry to begin with! When I saw this recipe I knew I had to try it so the cans stayed out on the counter until Sunday morning. Sunday morning rolled around and within no time at all these little guys popped out of the oven. Such an easy recipe (my favorite kind on Sunday mornings) to put together. I have to confess I used collard greens because the market was out of spinach (how is that even possible?) and I used heavy cream instead of milk because I had some that needed to be used up. None the less these little guys were really easy to throw together looked great and tasted wonderful. This recipe is a keeper and I know I will be making these little guys again in the future soon.
