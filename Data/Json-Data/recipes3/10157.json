I seasoned the chicken with some garlic salt as well as the salt and pepper and  cooked it  in a combination of olive oil and butter for a little extra flavor.  One and a half teaspoons each of honey and balsamic vinegar seemed a little skimpy, so I increased that to one tablespoon each and it was just the right amount.  I combined the two before I added it to the chicken and it blended in easily.   I try to limit my carbs, so I served this with fresh green beans and sliced tomatoes but frankly, this would have been even better with some hot cooked rice.",

First, there was not enough sauce to suit my husband. I started by saut\u00e9ing a couple of cloves of finely minced garlic after cooking the chicken (removed chicken to a plate and kept warm while making the sauce.) I then reduced 1/4 cup dry white wine by half, and added 2 Tb of chicken stock, along with the doubled balsamic and honey. This rounded out the flavor perfectly to suit our palates. Simmered the sauce for a few minutes until it started to get a little syrupy. Added the chicken back in and folded it gently into the sauce for 2 minutes to rewarm the meat. Sprinkled liberally with a chiffonnade of fresh basil at the last minute. Served it over rice cooked in chicken stock and it was a fabulous summer dinner.  Although those steps added to the prep time, it was still pretty quick to throw together. The flavor advancement made the few extra minutes seem like a good trade-off.",

The package of chicken I bought was enough to triple this recipe so I made the whole package, and I'd say that made a good amount for 3 people. I will make this often! YUM!",
