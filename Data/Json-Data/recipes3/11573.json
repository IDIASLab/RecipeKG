                "reviewBody": "First off this salad is DELICIOUS. Honestly one of the best I've had in quite a while. The flavors go so well together - the peppery arugula the sweet and tangy peaches and the grilled chicken. Yum. The directions are a little confusing. In Step 2 you are making the dressing for the salad. Set this aside. You then take the remaining (plain) oil and use that to brush on the cut peaches and chicken before grilling. That said this really doesn't give much flavor to the chicken. My recommendation is to just mix all the oil together into the dressing then take a couple teaspoons of the dressing and brush THAT onto the peaches and chicken. I mean you're mixing up dressing anyway why not give the chicken a kick? This makes 6 very small servings especially once you toss the arugula with the dressing as it shrinks down some. In my opinion 4 chicken breasts is a lot for 8 cups of arugula. Here are the proportions I recommend for 2 entree size portions: keep all the ingredients the same except use 2 (4oz) chicken breasts. Given the adjustments I had to make this is still a 5 star recipe not only for it's ease but for the impressive payoff! Thank you Trisha for sharing your recipe!",

Poured the dressing over chicken tenders in a 9x13 pan. Baked the chicken till done - about 30 minutes at 375.  It was amazing. Served with rice and broccoli. Quick, easy, yummy dinner.",
