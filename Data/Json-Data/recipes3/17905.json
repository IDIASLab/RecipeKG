        "description": "My mother, Pauline, made really nice thumbprint cookies, but I never wrote down her recipe. I knew the ingredients, but unless you have the right proportions, you won't get that perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture. So, I did an image search and found a recipe that looked very similar, credited to a great-grandma named Mitzi. Since my last name is Mitzewich, that pretty much sealed the deal. In case you can't decide between a shortbread-focused cookie and a more jammy one, here's how to make both.",

I have tried many others over the 20 years of baking and giving special holiday bakes as gifts. In fact I had all but abandoned the prospect of finding a good thumbprint dough recipe. After 5 years of experimenting I stopped trying because of the irritation with the waste of home made jams and jellies in the trial process. This recipe has changed my attitude toward these beautiful and colorful cookies. I even went out and purchased some high-end jelly for a second batch!! Love it!! Thanks for sharing.",
