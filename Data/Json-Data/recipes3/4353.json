Because this is such a basic recipe this fit my needs perfectly. I omitted the onion and cheese and substituted frozen green peas for the lima beans keeping all else the same. My roasted red peppers were particularly mushy so they didn't stay in chunky pieces--but actually it made the salad take on an attractive color and speckled appearance that made it very pretty! Good and satisfying tuna pasta salad with much room for flexibility with the ingredients. Hubby was a happy camper!",
