                "reviewBody": "Just for the record -- this is not a traditional P\u00f6nnuk\u00f6kur recipe. In Iceland we do not use sour cream or nearly that many eggs. You would need to use a special crepe pan to get the correct thinness (that is key for authenticity). We also do not typically serve it rolled with brown sugar or icing sugar but it is traditionally served either regular granulated sugar in the middle and rolled up(for the kids) or with jam and whipped cream then folded into triangles (served at get-togethers w/coffee). While this recipe is delicious it is not the same as Icelandic P\u00f6nnuk\u00f6kur. A more traditional recipe is more like: 2 c flour 1 tbsp sugar 1/8 tsp baking soda 2 eggs 1-2 tsp cardamom (or vanilla) 3/4 c margarine (melted) and milk added until it has a somewhat runny consistency. A good P\u00f6nnuk\u00f6kur pan is passed down from generations from mother to daughter and is already well \"seasoned\". If you are starting out with a new one you may have to go through several pancakes before it forms well. Melt butter on the pan and add to batter before frying. The thinner you can get the pancake to fry without falling apart or with holes the more admiration you get;)",
