I seasoned with salt and pepper when I added the vinegar and dill. My mum would salt the cucumber and onions first and let them sit in a sieve for about 15-30 minutes then squeeze out the excess water before transferring to a serving bowl and adding the dressing. Doing it the way it says in the recipe just cuts about a half hour of prep time, the result is the same. Yummy!\nTo give the salad a bit more colour I also added a bit of thinly sliced red bell pepper.  \nAnother option is to also add some cherry tomatoes, crumbled feta cheese and kalamata olives. The salad goes from Hungarian to Greek!",

It improved the flavor. For some reason this salad tasted like non tart pickle slices. It tastes great cold and just made but like most salads with salt I didn't care for it after it sat.
