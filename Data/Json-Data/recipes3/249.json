I found canned peas to be a little too mushy, even when added at the last possible second, so I think we'll just have them on the side next time.  My only question is why this is called \"One Dish Chicken Noodles\" when the recipe calls for two large pans?  Oh well, it's still easy, fast and even nutritious if you choose the ingredients well.",

I started out by using 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, to saute 1 clove of fresh garlic and half of a medium onion.  I added my chicken was the garlic began to brown along with a little Seasonal Salt, sweet basil, and pepper.  From there I followed the directions to a \"T\", but once finished, I added a coating of Parmesan cheese.  This is a great dish and a do over in our household!",
