I skipped the butter and reduced the oil by at least half.  I used less cheese than called for and split the cheese between mozarella and parmesan and used some red chili pepper flakes to spice it up.  When it was time to add the sauce to the rest, I had to add a little more broth and milk to get the right consistency, but it tasted great, regardless. So far as the bulk of the recipe, I used tri-color veggie rotini, ground turkey, again FAR less oil than called for, and added in four cloves of garlic. My biggest change? For me, it remained a skillet casserole only! I did not take the final step of pouring it in a pan, adding even MORE cheese, and sticking it under the broiler. That step is simply unnecessary as it should be absolutely delicious straight from the frypan!!",

I diced the breast and browned it, then I added the broccoli and followed the recipe from there. I don't think there is a need to use two skillets, one worked fine for me. I also chopped the broccoli in the food processor, and I used more than called for. I didn't add the chili pepper, but I did use the sour cream. My picky 5-year-old ate it and my husband finished the leftovers the next day. I suggest adding fresh garlic. Next time I'm going to add celery and garlic with the chicken, and add carrots with the broccoli. ",

My husband and I both liked it and we will be eating the huge amount of leftovers.  We liked the spice but thought it might need some lime juice to finish the flavor.  I also like the sorta low-fat easy sauce in the recipe, which I might use as a base for other recipes. Here's my main problem with the recipe- I make casseroles to cut down on cooking steps, casseroles are supposed to cook in the oven.  This recipe still has you cook everything and then combine it and broil.  I may as well have just eaten it out of the bowl once I mixed it all together, since it was already hot and everything was fully cooked.  I sprinkled it with bread crumbs to make it more crispy, which I liked.  ",
