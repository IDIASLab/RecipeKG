I used less corn added some green beans used 2% milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and seasoning salt instead of plain salt. I also sauted all of the veggies not just the onions. I was afraid that they wouldn't soften enough for my toddlers' tastes. I really didn't think I was going to like this but wanted to try something new. It was really good - no left overs even!",
