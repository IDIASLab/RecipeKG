However, with all these cold, mayonnaise-based salads, I always cut the mayo in half and use a light sour cream for the other.  To me, it makes it creamier and a lot healthier without sacraficing taste.  Everyone appreciates it, too.  With the added mustard, it is really perfect.  I salt (everything) very lightly and sprinkled a really good layer of pepper over the potatoes.  Also, I used only half the eggs.  The celery adds a welcome crunch.  Make a big batch so you can enjoy it for a few days!  Thanks Dee.",
