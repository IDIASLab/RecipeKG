I use Mexican nacho cheese in a can instead of the shredded cheese. (The shredded made it too stringy in the slow cooker)I added some jalape\u00f1os half an onion and a cup of salsa. I served with corn chips and nacho chips. Had lots of good comments. Just make it a few hours before people arrive set it on low in the slow cooker until hot/ warm. Easy to throw together.

Next time I would also add a 4 oz. can chopped green chiles or maybe even a 4 oz. can of chopped jalapenos depending on the crowd. I served it with both scoop corn chips and scoop tortilla chips. Now this is coming from a gal who prefers tortilla chips but we all thought the corn chips were the clear winner. They are the perfect compliment to the flavors in the dip. Best served warm in a crockpot on low.",
