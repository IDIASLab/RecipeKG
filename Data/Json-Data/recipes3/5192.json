My only complaint is that cooking/mashing the squash left the batter too moist (because the squash takes on water, which only gets worse if you boil it too long!), and that in turn made the puffs greasier. My suggestion would be to either add more flour/cornmeal, OR only puree the *raw* squash and use that instead of the cook/mashed squash (use 2 cups of puree just like 2 c. of the mash). I've tried this with zucchini and it worked wonderful. Also, if you want to use something in place of Jiffy cornbread mix: 2 T. of sugar, an extra tsp. of baking powder (3 tsp. total), up the salt by 1/4 tsp. (1 tsp. total), and use 2/3 c. cornmeal (or a cornmeal/white flour mix if that is too \"corny\" for you).",

Instead of simmering and mashing the squash, I grated it just like the onion, and then instead of deep frying, just sauteing, with 2 tablespoons of butter. Somewhat like a  pancake, loosely speaking.  While it isn't puffy like a deep-fried fritter, it was quite good and with a little less in the fat calorie column.  The fat content is the only reason I didn't give a full five stars, but that is just a personal thing.  Thanks for a great idea!",
