I only had yellow peppers to use instead of the green. Since I had no white wine handy I had to use some vermouth. I also added a Tblsp. of sliced black olives because I wanted to use them up. They actually added a bit of extra color to the dish too. Before browning my chops I seasoned them with premixed Italian spices. The end result was a delicious meal. I served this over a bed of tricolored pasta and sprinkled fresh minced parsley over the whole dish. Thanks for a wonderful recipe Dan!",

The sauce is definitely tangy - I added a wee bit more Worcestershire sauce - and it complements the veggies nicely.
