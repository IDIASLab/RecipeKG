They stick to the cookie sheet so recipe could indicate to spray sheet with non-stick spray. I got better baking/browning when flattening slightly with the back of a spatula (sprayed with cooking spray) or oiled fingertips. I was testing this recipe as a possible gift for a friend with diabetes and I don't think the result is gift-worthy. However I will enjoy these with tea in the morning without regrets. They are certainly a healthy option.",

I made a few changes: used twice the amount of cinnamon and also kicked up the nutmeg and cloves.  Didn't have walnuts on hand but did add about 1 cup chopped up prunes along with the cup of raisins.  I used cinnamon applesauce and margarine instead of the oil.  Because someone said they are not really sweet, I added 1 T honey for good measure.  The batter was thin so I decided to bake them like I would brownies, in a cookie sheet (for about 20 minutes).  The aroma that came from the oven was heavenly.  They fit the bill for what I was wanting.  Best thing about this recipe is you can add whatever suits your tastes.",

People who don't like this recipe may not be used to home-baked sugarless goodies. They are not designed to be very \"sweet\". I doubled all the spices added 4 \"Splenda\" packets (I didn't have honey) and 1/2 tsp salt. The dough is thin but firms up a little upon standing -- the oatmeal soaks up some of the excess moisture. No this isn't a crunchy cookie. I flattened out my spoonfuls for a cookie shape. Baked about 8-10 minutes then let them cool. My result was a nice soft chewy cookie. And a healthy treat for my husband's lunch box. If you are trying to duplicate a sugar free \"store bought\" cookie or get a result like Mom's this isn't it. I'll keep making these healthy snacks every week!! Try a cookie sandwich with a small amount of peanut butter in the middle!!",
