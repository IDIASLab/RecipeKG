The skin ended up really soggy so we took it off (and therefore lost all the seasoning as well). I have to imagine that the salt and pepper amounts were a typo...I used far less than 2 tablespoons. The onion was ok but it didn't particularly add anything to the chicken nor was it anything special by itself. If you're looking for yummy baked onion try Vidalia Heaven on this site. This recipe wasn't bad it just wasn't special. On the plus side this was a quick and easy recipe both in prep and cleanup. If I make this again I'll make the following changes: use skinless chicken add some paprika for color and add some carrots and green beans along with the onion for additional color/flavor. Thanks for the recipe.",

This is by far the most delicious way I've baked chicken. The aluminum foil is a great idea as it really allows the spices to infuse into the drumsticks. I would probably take the foil off the chicken 5-10 minutes earlier in the future because I like my drumsticks a little crispier but they were still fabulous. Also I used kosher drumsticks which I have found to be juicier. Great recipe and I will definitely be making this again soon!!",
