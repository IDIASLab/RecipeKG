Several years ago, we decided to forgo our traditional big sit-down dinner for a buffet because of everyone's increasingly different visiting/family obligations on that day. Everyone could eat whenever or if they chose to. I'd had this soup, which I loved, at several different restaurants over time. Through trial and error, I came up with my own recipe, which has been a hit.  I serve it with a dollop of creme fraiche.",

I changed a couple of things, used fresh basil instead of dried, added chopped onion and garlic, spooned in tomato paste to kick up the color and add a little thickener, bought canned roasted red peppers (way easier), and added a splash of sherry in the bowl before spooning in the soup.

I can't wait for crab to be in season so I can use big chunks of Dungeness, instead of the flake white crab meat (which was lovely, but not the same...). Thanks for the recipe - a definite keeper!",

Peeling the red peppers was easy enough, but it was still quite tedious and took about 40 minutes to do.   I found that the places where the skin was blackened peeled very easily; the places where the pepper pieces didn't lie flat did not blacken and so did not peel as easily. I used only 1/2 tsp salt, deciding to let the guests add more if they wished. I used the full 1/4 tsp of cayenne knowing that our friends don't mind spicyness.  When I tasted it, it was quite spicy, but not overly.  I refrigerated the soup overnight. I added the crab when starting to reheat the soup about 30 minutes prior to serving.  The cayenne had mellowed overnight. The soup's flavour was absolutely lovely.  It was worth all the effort.  Thanks.",

However when you consider the effort involved (I not only roasted the peppers but made my own chicken broth as well) and the expense (crab meat is not cheap particularly the jumbo lump crab I used) hubs and I both agree this is a mediocre soup boring bland and uninspired. Sherry might have been a nice addition as well as maybe starting this off by sauteeing the \"holy trinity\" of carrots onions and celery. Fish stock or clam juice could be used as well and would have complemented the crab. It definitely needs more depth and rounded out flavors. As is it basically tasted no more than what it was - pureed roasted peppers and half and half with some crab meat thrown in at the end.",
