The result is a mildly sweet substantial muffin with almost a carrot cake like flavor. They taste good the next day too. I will be baking these again with the modifications described above.

They are extemely fluffy for whole wheat muffins not necessarily very moist but light and airy. They're also not very sweet even with the Splendas but I'm surprisingly pleased at the light sweetness and spice-cake flavour. My roommates loved them and I had to hide the extras.
