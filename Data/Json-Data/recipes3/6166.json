This recipe halves nicely. The first time I used vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk and added a few teaspoons of sugar to make sweet farls. I sliced the farl in half horizontally while it was hot and spread butter and raspberry jam inside. The second time I followed the recipe exactly. (Since the recipe doesn't specify how much salt to use I used 1/8 tsp salt for a half recipe - I think next time I will use more.) It made the kitchen smell good and kind of like pancakes. I will definitely make these again.",
