I used 3 slices of 2% American cheese and 3 slices of muenster that I needed to use up. Very flavorful, and I liked how the cheese made sort of a 'crust' on top. Super simple...a definite keeper~YUM!

Moisture aside the meat eggs and cheese together were a little much for me. I think I would prefer a vegetable-egg combo but this is just a matter of personal taste. Also if you decide to make this use very little salt on the eggs. The ham provides more than enough saltiness.",
