Instead of filling the crepe with mixed berries I filled it with melted chocolate sliced almonds and sliced bananas. I also took other reviewers advice and used applesauce instead of vegetable oil. I found the ratio of flour and milk to result in thicker than expected batter so I added about two tablespoons more milk. Not only did the crepes come out thinner but made it easer to spread the batter in the pan. Also I found that a dash of cinnamon and half a tablespoon of vanilla extract really adds a nice flavor to the crepe. The last alteration I made was cooking the batter in coconut oil instead of using the recommended cooking spray. It s healthier and tastier! I decorated the crepes with powdered sugar and served them with vanilla yogurt sliced strawberries and blackberries.",
