So I used much less sugar (to taste) and melted two oz. unsweetened chocolate with a handful of semisweet chips and a tab of butter. I then added this to the frosting, making it dreamily rich and intense. To bring out the chocolate flavor even more, I stirred some instant coffee with a bit of water (one could also mix it with the extract) and added to taste. The result: sinfully rich and uber chocolatey frosting that holds its shape and is perfect on Chocolate-Zucchini Cupcakes (also on this site). It couldn't get any better.",
