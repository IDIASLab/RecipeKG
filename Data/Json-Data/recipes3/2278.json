I have also altered the water ingrediant and used a can of cream of mushroom so that there is some \"gravy\" to pour all over. On occassion I have seen some people wrinkle their nose at the thought of eating bear meat but when I serve this they change their minds! Many times they can't even tell the difference! A stomach doesn't care as long as it's good and this is one of the best. Add/subtract you favorite veggies and enjoy!!",
