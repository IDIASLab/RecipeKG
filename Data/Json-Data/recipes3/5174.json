Then I used the water the chicken boiled in and used that in place of chicken broth the recipie called for and also added 1/2 boullion cube. I did add the broth when I added the zuchinni since I had cubed them in large pieces and needed them to have some liquid to become tender. I ommited the red pepper and added a bit extra cream cheese to make the sauce thicker. Very good and will make again with all the zucchini growing in the garder!",

The chicken makes it heartier and more substantial but I left it out for some vegitarian friends and it was still delicious. Even without cream cheese (for a lactose intolerant friend)this dish wowed them all. The only alterations I made were replacing half of the broth with vermouth (a white wine will work well too) and adding mushrooms just before the broth/wine. This recipe doubles/triples well and is very forgiving to mismeasures (I've lost all of my measuring spoons in a recent move). I served with some bruschetta and a white wine/citrus spritzer. My guests are still raving about this pasta.",

I wouldn't recommend using penne pasta because it's hard to eat with all the chicken and veggies to get it on your fork was impossible it seemed. So maybe bowtie or rigatoni or something. Penne is just kind of a stiff pasta. But super tasty and I'll definitely be making again and again. Excellent summer dish.",
