I've spent a lot of time in Louisiana around the coastal areas and have eaten more than my fair share of dirty rice without believing it was as simple as this recipe.  The flavors seem so complex!  When my husband requested dirty rice to be served alongside my shrimp etouffe, I tried this basic recipe, thinking I would later make changes and create my own using this recipe as the structure. Wow. Completely unnecessary!  The ONLY thing I added was a 1/4 t of white pepper and 1/2 t of salt. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",

I got over how the pureed livers looked in the blender. I make a big batch now. It seems to get better and better the second and third day. This is a great recipe.",

I used a pound of chicken livers and 2 small vidalia onions sauteed with the chicken livers.  I sauteed them in bacon grease too.  I added Mrs. dash spicy pepper blend, it has cayenne in it.  I also added a decent dash of garlic salt.  My husband ate 3 servings of it, \"jethro bodine servings\"!. My kids even ate it and they hate chicken livers and wont eat rice, but they liked this.  I didnt tell them it was livers in it though.  Hats off to you Kathleen and your elders, who invented this recipe!  It is delicious!!!!!",
