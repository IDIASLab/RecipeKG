We all agreed it needs a bit more flavor. Next time we'll try draining the tomatoes so the veggies aren't as watery and perhaps add red pepper flakes more capers and a little more pepper. The vegetables would be better sauteed in some of the olive oil before adding to the baking pan - they were undercooked and the fish would have been overcooked if left in the oven long enough for the vegetables to catch up. Precooking the celery and onions etc. would also enhance the flavor. A good healthy main course that just needs a bit of tweaking to personal tastes.",
