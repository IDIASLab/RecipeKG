It turned out that I did not have a full half-cup of salsa, so I added some Chi-Chi's salsa vinaigrette dressing that was in the fridge. Lacking orange juice I added some Best Foods Oriental Orange salad dressing, and that was delicious. All in all it was a great meal, but the salad dressing did make the sauce a little bit runny. I am going to use the full half-cup of salsa next time and see how I like it then. Delicious and thanks for sharing!\n\nI've also made this several times since I posted the first review, and my favorite variation thus far is to use a jar of peach-pineapple salsa, cut the chicken breasts into cubes, and let it simmer in the salsa, then serve it with brown rice. I love this stuff!",
