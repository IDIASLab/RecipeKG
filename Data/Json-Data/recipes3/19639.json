I made double the amount and had too much sauce (Best Marinara Sauce Yet, here at AllRecipes), which made it a little sloppy when serving, but nonetheless yummy.  Everyone was happy that there was plenty of sauce to mop up with crusty bread!  And hubby has asked that I make it again at the earliest available opportunity.\r\n\r\nDegorging (ie salting) is done only to take away bitterness (not make eggplant tender as some reviewers believe), and it is not necessary when you have wonderful tight-skinned, fresh young eggplants.  Degorging actually might contribute to the greasiness of the dish.  (Drawing moisture from eggplants with salt makes the temperature of the oil drop too much when adding them to the pan, hence they absorb more oil.)  I didn't degorge my eggplants, and used a non-stick pan with a smear of extra-virgin olive oil.  Very little fat, and no bitterness.",

Dipped slices in egg then italian bread crumbs then browned in skillet for about 2 minutes each side.  I used Classico Tomato Basil sauce, therefore I didn't add as much basil, like the recipe calls for.  For cheese I used a sm. tub of ricotta (15 oz) and a 8 oz bag mozzerella and a sm. bag parmesean.  My husband loved all of the cheese and told me this one is a keeper.",

I sliced the eggplant about 1/4 inch thick and allowed it to sweat for about 2 hours. I also cut way down on the oil for frying the eggplant - just a smidge in a non-stick pan. I used my own homemade sauce. Although not difficult per se there are quite a few steps to this recipe and I wanted it to be worth the time so I made several smallish tins of it and froze them. They defrost great and are a wonderful and quick work-night treat! Thanks for sending this in - it will certainly become one of my regular dishes!",

When assembling instead of trying to smooth out the ricotta mixture I just put a dollop on each eggplant round then put another eggplant round right on top of that then added another ricotta dollop. Instead of having an even casserole I had 12 individual eggplant mounds that were easy and attractive to plate.",
