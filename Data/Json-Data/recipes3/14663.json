I was looking for something different to do with fresh salmon and recognized this recipe as one we used as an appetizer that I had forgotten about. I don't understand why the low ratings because this was more popular than any other appetizer we offered. The only change I made was to bake fresh salmon and then use my hand chopper to finely chop the onion and salmon before mixing everything together. I think that will make a difference in blending the smoke and other ingredients into a salmon lovers dream dish that is beyond perfect for any special occasion. I also would recommend doubling the recipe to make sure there is enough to go around. Thank you Shuffcow for a blast from my past!",
