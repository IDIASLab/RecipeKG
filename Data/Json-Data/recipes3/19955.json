Finally instead of rolling individual enchiladas I layered small corn tortillas then the chicken mixture then more corn tortillas and finished with cheese and enchilada sauce. I am a vegetarian so I did not try the dish but it received rave reviews and was gone before I knew it!",

One guy was complaining to me that \"he doesn't like to try anything new\" and that this dish looked suspicious (because of the olives on top). His wife browbeat him into trying it... and he RAVED about it and even went back for seconds! This is a great recipe; I really liked it. I cooked the chicken in the crock pot all day while I was at work (just 3 frozen split chicken breasts and a cup of water) to avoid having to cook them at night and then shredded the meat. Came out great! I also used mild salsa because we don't like things too spicy. I'm definitely adding this to my rotation at home.",

I have been looking and looking for a red sauce type enchilada because the one I was making used Cream of Chicken Soup and it just wasn't very Mexicany. After reading other reviews I made a few minor changes. I didn't have green onions but I sauted some regular onion in some butter and added it to the mixture instead. I also added Cumin and garlic pepper to both the filling and the sauce. I also added a little bit of cheese in the filling and used a mexican blend cheese on top. It made a whole lot of filling and I was able to use 8 tortillas instead of 6 and probably could have used the whole 10 even. I did double the sauce which I was glad I did because it wouldn't have been enough if I didn't. I did't use any olives because I didn't have any and I can't stand them anyway. I did drain my can of tomatoes and the enchiladas weren't soggy at all! In fact DH said that the filling melded w/ the tortillas extremely well and this is the recipe he wants me to always use! And believe me I sure will! I can't wait for supper tonight to eat some more!",

He is on his second plate right now. I did half the recipe. I ended up with 5 stuffed 10 inch tortillas. I used a \"full\" recipe of sauce so I recommend if you are doing a full recipe to double the sauce and make sure you cook it down so the flavors meld. I would add some more cheese if you do the \"full\" recipe. I used the Rotel diced tomato/green chilis lots more flavor.. also make sure you \"drain\" them I am sure that is why some are ending up with soaky/watery. I forgot to add that I cooked my chicken breast in skillet with cilantro flavored oil after I flipped to second side to brown I then added some water to the skillet put a lid on and turned down to med and steamed it the rest of the way. This chicken came out so moist and easy to shred for the recipe. Don't skip the olives and if you don't like your onion with a little crunch then saute before hand. Excellent!! Thank you!!",
