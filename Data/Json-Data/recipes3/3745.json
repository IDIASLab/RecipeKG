I guess you could use diced canned tomatoes instead as well. I reduced the temperature to 400 degrees as I used cooked shrimp instead of the uncooked shrimp. If you do this you may want to experiment with the temperature & cooking time as you want to make sure not to cook the dish too long. You want to heat up the shrimp but not have them rubbery. I also left out the oregano as my husband isn't a big fan. Next time I think I'll try a flavored feta (garlic/herb or tomato/basil) for a little more of a flavor punch.",
