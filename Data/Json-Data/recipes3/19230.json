One way is to wrap one or two slices of dried beef around the chicken breast, then wrap a couple of slices of partially cooked bacon around that. I've also pounded the breasts and rolled them with the dried beef, wrapped the rolls with bacon and then browned them to crisp the bacon before baking in sour cream mixture. If I want to be lazy, I'll wrap the chicken in the bacon brown to crisp and then finely chop a few slices of the dried beef and mix it into the sour cream soup mix. With all methods I always make extra sauce and always add sliced fresh mushrooms and a bit of sherry.This is really one of our favorite recipes. I'm not sure that I'd like it with the whole dried beef slices underneath it all. I think the beef needs to be more incorporated into the dish.",

I have loved this ever since he made it for me the first time, and I like being able to make it myself now.  \r\n\r\nOur ingredients are basically the same, but the assembly is a little different.  Instead of dried beef, we use the inexpensive thin sandwich beef (Carl Buddig brand in our area).  I have never felt the recipe is overly salty, so the luncheon meat must help with this.  In addition, I use chicken breast tenderloins instead of the whole breast.  \r\n\r\nFor assembly, we wrap 2 slices of the beef around the chicken tenderloin, then wrap the bacon around it, then pour the sour cream/soup over the top of the assembled pieces.",

Since my first time I've experimented and have placed either chopped spinach aspargus or sliced carrots on top of the breast before wrapping in the bacon. I also layer swiss chesse on top of the bacon prior to covering in the soup/sour cream. If I've used spinach I use cream of spinach soup; aspargus cream of aspargus etc. This recipe can really be changed added to and it comes out great every time.",

I fix this the day before put it in the fridge over night thereby freeing up my time when I have company. I also leave out the bacon entirely since tere is plenty of salt and taste without it and my family complained about the 'grease'. I increase the sour cream to a pint per can of soup. It also reheats like a dream even in a microwave. Also you can cook it at 250 275 300 350 just try and see which result you like. I think it is better the longer it cooks so I opt for 250 and 3 hours. Enjoy!!",
