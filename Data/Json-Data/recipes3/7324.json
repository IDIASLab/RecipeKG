I did include the corn for added crunch, sweetness and texture...it complimented the sweetness of the carrot nicely. I did use roasted chicken as opposed to popcorn chicken, as I felt it was a healthier option...though the fried bits would have made it incredible. Thank you ally-gator for sharing. Next time, I might just sprinkle the cheese on top of each portion as I did with the corn.",
