I've never seen pork loins come in 1lb roasts so I'm assuming this recipe is for tenderloins - they usually are between 1-1.25 lbs each. Also 1 lb of meat does not serve 6 people so I highly suggest making at least 2. I didn't have honey dijon so I used regular dijon with great results. I also added some olive oil to roast the vegetable mixture. I didn't use the full amount of thyme because it sounded like a lot but that is personal preference. After reading through the directions 45 mins 25 mins of roasting at 450 seemed excessive for vegetables so this is what I did: I roasted them for 20 mins added the pork then roasted an additional 30 minutes until the pork was at 145. Everything was done to perfection! Thank you starsmed for the wonderful recipe! I can't wait to make it again!",

I started it all at the same time instead of the veggies first. I think the veggies would've been way over cooked had I started them earlier. I also added some water to the pan during cooking as the pan was dry. Awesome flavor though!! Will definitely make this again.",
