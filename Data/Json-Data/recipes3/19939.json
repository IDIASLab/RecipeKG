This would be easy to make for a big crowd, and it would make an impressive presentation without killing yourself over it.  Everyone loved it, including my sister's not-quite-one-year-old baby.  Zatarain's Creole Seasoning has the perfect spice for this recipe, and it turned out great even with substituting ranch dressing for bleu cheese, a Hillshire Farms smoked beef sausage instead of andouille and plain ol' produce section mushrooms.  A very big hit at my house.  Cannot recommend highly enough!!",

I tasted the sauted mixture before adding it to my Magic Bullet for chopping and it was SOOO GOOD!I would eat that over brown rice any day!  My whole family loved it! The next time I fix it I will bake it covered and take the foil off for the last 10-15 min just to make the chicken more tender and seal in more juices! It's a great recipe, thanks Mike!",

Those are just personal preferences though this is a great recipe. Also I only puree half the stuffing then stuff the breasts and the unpureed mixture goes over the top.I usually serve with a wild mushroom risotto and make it as often as I have time.",

I followed the recipe precisely but would add to the instructions that the most of the fat from browning the sausage should be drained off. I used 8 oz. of smoked sausage and it was delicious. Would also suggest Tony Chachere's Famous Creole Seasoning as the seasoning to sprinkle on the chicken. It's my husband favorite and I have no trouble finding it at major grocery stores. With the entree I served herb and butter wild rice (prepackaged)...made a nice side dish. We're adding this recipe to our list of family favorites!",
