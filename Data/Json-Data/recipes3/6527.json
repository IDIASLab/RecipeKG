I used a bag of dried Chile Colorado, poached it with the tomatoes and garlic cloves, added about a cup of water and blended it with a chicken boullin instead of tomato boullin. Then I added it to the chopped chuck and let it simmer for 15 minutes, it was AWESOME! I am now going to use this same adjusted recipe for sauce for enchiladas!",

Use carne de pulpa (or pulpa negra) you can find this at any mexican grocery store it's better than flank for this recipe.2. I don't cook the meat all the way through before adding the sauce. Once you put the meat in the pan with the oil cover it. This allows for the meats juices to be released once I see the juice released I add the sauce it really gives it extra flavor.",
