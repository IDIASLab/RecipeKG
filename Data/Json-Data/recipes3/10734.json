I had a piece of young ginger (totally different from ground ginger or even regular ginger root so I changed the recipe a bit) that went perfectly with the salmon and grapefruit. I also used fresh garlic that I made into a paste with a bit of salt and I added a pinch of monk fruit sugar to balance the bitterness of the grapefruit. Regular caster sugar would have been fine but I happened to have a sample packet of monkfruit sugar on hand. I'll make this recipe again.",
