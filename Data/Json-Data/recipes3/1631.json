I was afraid this might have a processed taste and it did. I'm not a food snob and I have nothing against using can cream of mushroom etc. soups. But it has been my experience that unless really diluted with other things it can give a processed food taste. But I was craving white rice and gravy and thought I'd give it a try. It wasn't at all horrible but it's not something I'd make again. However it gets 3 stars for being easy and convenient. I think substituting one of the cream soups most likely the celery and upping the broth (Cook the rice separate). Removing the chicken when done and thickening the gravy with a butter and flour roux would greatly help with the processed flavor. But to each his own.",

Use NON-STICK COOKING SPRAY on that glass baking dish too; a light touch of it really helps out!! My family LOVED this dish...and I was getting creatively inspired!! I went full-throttle rouge my 2nd time making this: Made several large baked potatoes--and shredded them ( skin and all!! ) covering the baking dish covered with \"savory herb and garlic\" flavored soup mix. I hickory smoked the chicken and subbed Cream of Cheddar over cream of celery--and added green beans to the sauce mix!! 30 min. in the oven--I tore off the aluminum top and baked on for 15 more minutes!! As the dish cooled down I ground down some flavored croutons and lightly topped the thick sauce with it. Major hit with my family--and my toughest food critics!! TARAWVU you are indeed a genius--thank you for this great dinner dish!!",
