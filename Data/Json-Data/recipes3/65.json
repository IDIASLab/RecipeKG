(In retrospect I should have gradually added the basil to taste). The second time I made these I used just one oz. package of fresh basil which seemed perfect. All my family members liked it (hubby parents and siblings). With this amount you can taste the basil but it s a good mix not too overpowering and the amount of cream cheese was adequate. Good taste! I did follow one person s suggestion of putting the basil sun-dried tomatoes and cream cheese in a food processor --- this worked out nicely. A note about the tortillas: I noticed that the La Mexicana brand tortillas were a little firmer than the Azteca brand. The Azteca brand seemed to crack/split more easily when rolling since they re softer but they still ended up rolling nicely. It helps if you take the rolls out of the refrigerator maybe an hour before serving to allow the tortillas & cream cheese to soften a bit so the pinwheels aren t too dry.",
