These turn out yummy chewy and they are the easiest cookies in the world to make. I have found the trick to make them perfect non-spreading and non-sticking. Instead of adding the eggs and oil separately; beat the eggs and oil together in a small bowl first then add it to the mix and combine. Now you can do your additions. Butterscotch semi-sweet milk chocolate heath bits coconut nuts or whatever your fancy. I use a small cookie scoop and cooke for 12 minutes. Crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside. They turn out perfect",

Plus these cookies have a great shape and thickness for ice cream sandwich cookies. Just soften some ice cream shovel some out with a spoon and place it on a cookie. put another cookie on top stick the whole thing in a zip-loc bag then immediately in the freezer. Take out and serve whenever you want. This is a great treat for a party (nothing fancy cuz it can be a bit messy while eating) or for any hot summer day.",

I refrigerated the dough for about an hour. There is nothing wrong with the taste of these cookies but the are very difficult to work with. All the time you save with prep you waste after baking. You have to watch like a hawk in the oven because they go from under to over very quickly. You also have to time your removal from cookie sheet precisely...too short cookie literally falls apart in your hand making a yummy mess. Too long and you need a crow bar to get them off of tray again yummy mess. I ended up only getting about 10 servable cookies. the rest were a yummy crumble.",

I made sure though to line my baking sheet with parchment paper---easier clean-up and makes sure the cookies won't stick! I also baked this for ONLY 8 MINUTES. It will look a little undone but will continue to bake when you take it out of the oven. Leave the cookies on the sheet for a minute and transfer to a wire rack. My cookies came out looking crackled and flat (not a bad thing) crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. Really good! (Store leftovers in an airtight container.) TIP: Everyone's oven is different. Try baking one small batch at 8 minutes another at 9 or 10. See what works best for you. 8 minutes worked best for me!",

I would definitely use parchment paper for these and err on the side of caution with the time. I also noticed that these spread differently depending on which brand of brownie mix you use. When I used Duncan Hines mix they spread really flat and crispy and only needed 8 minutes to bake. Pillsbury brownie mix resulted in a puffier cookie that needed about 9 minutes to bake and came off the cookie sheet easier....another reason I couldn't quite rate these a 5 the recipe is not consistent. Not a fault of the poster just a matter of fact based on my making them two times with different brands of product.",
