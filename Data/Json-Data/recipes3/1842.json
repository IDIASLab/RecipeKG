It's pretty good as is but as Reynbow correctly pointed out it lacks a little flavor. For those that prefer a subtle laid back flavor--this recipe might be okay \"as is.\" For me next time I make these I intend to add about 1/8 cup sugar and maybe another half can of pears. One thought; Holly may have intended for this recipe to use vanilla yogurt which already has sugar and offers more flavor than plain yogurt (without sugar added). I've only been cooking for a few years but I've learned that the best recipes are usually specific so the cook doesn't have to guess. Finally I wonder if bumping up the nutmeg and cinnamon would help the cause also.",
