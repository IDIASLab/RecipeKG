I went with the majority and decreased the mustard.  I scaled the servings down to 10 since it was just 2 of us eating this.  I added some oregano and granulated garlic instead of garlic salt.  I didn't have any celery, so I used some celery salt.  My spices were dry..I didn't have the fresh, and it was delicious.  One word of advice...make the full amount..you'll want leftovers for later!!

It was tasty and the pepper sauce melded so nicely. I added (yesterday) more parsley & some chopped green onion and like Josie used garlic powder and had no celery so used celery salt and cut the mustard to 1 tbsp. (even though I love mustard) YUM!
