I only had the frozen chicken breasts (like you buy at Sam's Club) I threw them in the pot frozen (didn't pre-boil) and took the advice of some of the others and cut down on the liquid and the butter.  Instead of water I used a can of vegtable broth, but I think it needed just a tad more liquid than that.  I also cooked it longer (like 6 hours).  The chicken absolutely fell apart and had a wonderful flavor, probably from the veg.broth).  Overall, it was great!  Will definately make again.",

VERY good recipe! Reheated in the microwave the next day is wonderful!!",

I used half white and half whole grain bread. I also threw in a handful of orange-flavored dried cranberries and some sliced raw mushrooms (which will add their own liquid while cooking!). Next time - I'll use really tough french bread and whole grain bread and will add even more dried cranberries - they made it really \"Thanksgiving-like\"!!!!",

I followed alot of their suggestions of cutting back on the butter and liquid which IO did. 1/2 cup of butter is more than enough. I also toasted the bread light brown before cutting it in cubes. I used 1 chicken boullion disolved in 1 cup of the fluid left over from poaching the chicken. I had chicken backs that I wanted to use instead of breast. I took off the skin but left the bone in to hold the meat together. I put the meat on the bottom of crock pot then covered with the dressing. Dried cranberries were the added touch this needed. It was so nice to come home from work and only have to prepare a vegetable to go with supper. I will certainly make this again.",

I also put frozen chicken leg quarters in the slow cooker first and then boned and skinned the chicken before adding the rest of the ingredients. My family raved for days about this recipe. Thanks Peg! This will definitely be on my list of \"best\" recipes! Update 1/2/2017: Fourteen years later this recipe is still used in several of my nieces' and nephews' Thanksgiving and Christmas BEST stuffing recipes! It has been adapted by some to be more vegetarian by leaving out the chicken. Other families have made it more low-carb by using low-carb bread. But Peg's original recipe definitely ranks in the top ten of my family's holiday MUST HAVE recipes! Another UPDATE 11/22/2017: Over the years I've had the best luck with this recipe when I've used the best tasting bread I can find. The absolute ultimate was when I mixed Russian Black Bread (which is slightly sweet) with toasted English Muffin bread. (That year even the teenage nieces and nephews who wont talk to me smiled at me in appreciation!) Unfortunately Franz Bakeries has stopped making the Russian Black bread so this year I am trying Kings Hawaiian Bread (slightly sweet) with toasted English Muffins and homemade white bread. However the only time I really regretted my bread choice was when I used the pre-packaged dried cubes which are sold for stuffing. Don't do that!",
