It was one of my favorite meals, and I had no idea we were eating it out of necessity. Times aren't so tough now, but I still make this about once a month. It's great when you're in a hurry, or have limited supplies on hand. My kids love it too!",

But, you absolutely, positively must have frozen baby peas added to the recipe, and if you are feeling rich, then butter your toast before adding the creamed tuna.  This is pure comfort food for me, it was something that really only my mom and I liked.  The rest of the family are it, but only because there was nothing else.  I loved it, and I still do, but my own children won't touch it.   I still make this when I'm sad or lost; my mom has been dead for 20 years, but she's at the table with me when I serve myself this dish.  Thank you for posting a happy memory for me.",

I always thought I was the only person on earth that ate this growing up in the 70's. and then I just now stumbled upon the recipe on here today. I come from a huge catholic family and my mom made this probably once a week. We all loved it then as kids and most of my siblings still make this now as adults.. My mom always served this with white rice. She often made the creamed sauce from scratch but in a pinch you can substitute cream of mushroom soup which is just as tasty. I make it the same way my mom taught me with diced celery peas parsley and dill I also use at least 3 cans of tuna with the water its packed in this really boosts the flavor. This is a really forgiving recipe and you can use ingredients in any amounts that suit your own personal taste. I highly recommend this served with the white rice instead of toast.",
