I did change a few things around...I used a 32 oz Box of Chicken Broth to boil Cauliflower in but after accessing everything ink re I wanted thicker soup so I then took 8oz of Broth out the pot before putting the cheese mix in. Also you don t really need the fresh herbs...I moved around my weekly food budget thinking I needed them and I didn t but it was a nice touch. Overall I loved and the cauliflower as cheese mix great beginning to a roast or mashed cauliflower potato dish!",
