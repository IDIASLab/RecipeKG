Save the juice when slicing the tomatoes and add the pepper red pepper and salt to taste as this will become the marinade otherwise the salad is just to dry to stand on it's own. As written this recipe is completely overwhelmed by the basil onions and cilantro. Herbs would be much better reduced by half so the flavor of the tomatoes is not \"lost\". With changes good use of summer produce.... Ummm!",

Ok so I have not been able to find the yellow tomatoes but that's no problem. Just add extra red. I find that I'm still slightly nervous about the garlic getting distributed evenly so I still juice a few of the tomatoes into a little bowl and stir the garlic into that. Then pour over all. What a pleasure to find a wonderful wonderful salad that the whole family loves and have it be fat free too! I've had this recipe for about 2 weeks and we've already had it 4 times. Thank you so much for sharing this!",
