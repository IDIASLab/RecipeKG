It is so yummy and different and probably pretty good for you because it is as green as spinach. I've been scouring the vegetable aisle for months trying to figure out what exactly the stuff is. Lo and behold, today I found it at Superstore. Of course I didn't know exactly until I actually cooked it, but there was no mistaking it. They are snow pea shoots! Yumm yumm!",

The sesame oil in the chicken is excellent - I would double it next time.  It really doesn't need the 3/4 Cup broth - as the Pea Shoots wilt quickly (like spinach) and release a lot of water.  If I were to make this again - I would add more sesame oil to the chicken along with some garlic chili paste,  also fresh ginger along with the garlic - add no or just a tiny bit of broth or water - a pinch of salt or soy sauce and a pinch of sugar to bring out the flavors.",

I always read reviews first just to find out what others think of this recipe and I used suggestions. I doubled the amount of sesame oil and am glad I did because it wasn't super strong and I love the flavor of sesame oil. I also added 3 cloves more garlic another bunch of pea shoots used homemade veggie broth in lieu of the chicken broth half a small onion diced some ginger soy sauce some sherry and a bit of sucanet to sweeten it up (I don't use regular sugar - only Sucanet which is also knows as Rapidura). I thought this was so delicious and I wouldn't hesitate to eat this again and again! I do think that the flavor would have been lacking but I think it has great potential to add flavors that you enjoy. I also served this up with Lundberg Wild Blend (a combination of long grain brown rice sweet brown rice Wehani Black Japonica and Wild Rice). I would have used another rice (Brown Basmati is my preferred) however the one I used needed to be used up. Really you should try this it is FANTASTIC!",

Delicious - especially when paired with Kale and Adzuki Beans (on this site) and served with rice. Next time I'll add more garlic and maybe ginger and other spices if I plan to serve alone. Very nice and flexible dinner.",
