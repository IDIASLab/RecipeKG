I made the turkey exactly as stated, except I made them into smaller \"patties\" rather than \"burgers.\"  They were incredibly tasty and added lots of zing to a boring old turkey burger.  I made the cucumber/lime/cumin salad and served it on the side.  Instead of pitas, I used Indian \"chipatis\" (or parathas), which is a yummy, flat Indian bread -- sort of like a tortilla but softer, fluffier and more tasty in my opinion -- got them frozen from the Indian grocery store and heated them up on a skillet.  Everyone was cleaning their plates and complimenting the dish.  The biggest compliment came from my brother in law, who grew up in Kenya around lots of real Indians who make real Indian food.  This recipe is a keeper.",

I served it over cous cous with sumac sprinkled on top and cucumber yougurt sauce on the side. It's my favorite meal.",

I will try to make this recipe true to the letter next time just for kicks. Had to make a couple of modifications due to lack of ingredients: subbed 2 Thai chilis for the jalapeno and subbed homemade habanero jelly for the chutney adding mint and cilantro to it to approximate the flavor of mint chutney. Oh and I had a brain toot thinking the recipe called for a couple of tsp plain yogurt -- must have confused it with another. Therefore the mixture couldn't support the entire 10 oz of spinach; it was just too wet. Know what though? I think the addition of yogurt and the reduced amount of spinach worked out really well... a fortuitous mistake. LOL Thank you sooooooo much for sharing this recipe!
