It doesn't make the cut but it wasn't bad. I chilled all ingredients first (a must when making punch) and thought it tasted too much like pineapple juice. I also added vodka to each individual glass that way you can control how much liquor you get and make the drinkers and non drinkers happy. Also that way you don't have to make sure the kids stay out of it! It was refreshing I may make again but if I do I'm scaling WAY back on the pineapple juice. Also added just a touch of grenadine to make it pretty.",
