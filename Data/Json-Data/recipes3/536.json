I have two teenage boys who require a hearty meal to sustain them for at least 1 hour (maybe less).

Serve as a sandwich, skip the pasta, mix with leftover cooked rice; add small green peas or broccoli. I doubt if anything you try will go wrong. Mangia!",

I used garlic and cheese sausages (we don't like spicy or fennel). My method for the meat is to brown the chicken and sausage completley in the garlic & olive oil. Cooking it now this way prevents the meat from becoming overcooked during the boiling and simmering process when making the sauce. Remove the meat and set aside than go on with making the sauce in the same skillet. I used red wine and chopped about 5 roma tomatoes (I don't like canned tomatoes). and let it simmer a bit. Once the tomatoes reduced a bit, I added a little cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce along with salt, pepper and 1/2 cup light cream (I got that tip fom other reviewers). I simmered the sauce for about 20 minutes, added the meat in and simmered another 20 minutes. I than added the pasta and a lot of chopped basil (we love basil) and the dish was very very tasty. I am not sure what people are doing when they say it comes out bland. This is very flavorful! \nThanks for the recipe!!",

Added the chicken and sausage. Cooked until done. Took meat out. Used 28 oz crushed tomatoe sauce 1/2 cup red wine 1 T italian seasoning and S & P to taste. Simmered added meat and simmered for another 20 minutes. Added 1/2 cup cream with 5 minutes to go. Spooned sauce over noodles. Topped with parmesan cheese. Yum! You could use a jar of spaghetti sauce with a splash of wine if in a hurry. Very good for a simple recipe.",

Since I don't like chunks of tomato I used spaghetti sauce from a jar and just added a little red wine to get that flavor. I cooked the meat in the sauce much longer about double the time. I added dried onion mid way through. I added cream as one reviewer suggested and I liked what that did to the texture. We will definately have this again!",

I added the zucchini pretty early in so it could cook with the sausage which gave it amazing flavor and even my little brother who doesn't care for it said it was tasty.
