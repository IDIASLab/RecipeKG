Usually I prefer to try a recipe exactly as it's written before fiddling with it but I found this recipe while trying to avoid a trip to the grocery store so I used what I had on hand. Instead of green onions I used a small yellow onion minced and a scant 1/2 tsp. chili powder substituted for the cayenne. I also cut back on the butter and used the cheap canister parmesan rather than fresh grated; however I don't think these changes altered the character of the dish. Perfect for a quick and flavorful weeknight dinner! Edited to update: I still make this fairly often. I never add salt (there's enough in the pasta and salami) and I usually leave out the butter. Olive oil seems essential to me but I think using cotto salami rather than hard salami makes it less greasy.",

Perhaps also next time I will try heavily salting the pasta when I cook it so I don't end up putting extra salt on top of the already salty salami. Update: Made this again and I took another reviewer's advice and fried the salami then used the salami grease to fry onion etc. Came out a lot less greasy. I didn't add any oil or butter and it was fine although if you wish you could add a bit at the end.",
