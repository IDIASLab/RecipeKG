Thanks to previous reviewers I didn't include any milk at all. However there is another problem - the two teaspoons of vanilla turns this an unpleasant dingy shade of off brownish-white. Fine if you're tinting your frosting undesirable if you're not. In hindsight I'd say use no vanilla at all or at most 1 tsp. use imitation clear vanilla or almond extract which is clear. Finally while the flavor was nice I wasn't totally pleased with the texture probably because of the flour. I wasn't nearly as pleased with this recipe as I've been with others from this site.",

To fix the problem of the frosting being too runny, like other reviewers mentioned, I just left out the milk. There really is no need for it. Perfect spreading consistancy and I was also able to decorate w/ it for borders and piping scroll work. This is a lightly crusting recipe also. Be sure to refrigerate your cake with this as it has raw egg whites in it. Highly recommended. :)",
