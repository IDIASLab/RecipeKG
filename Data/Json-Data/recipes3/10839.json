I halved the recipe and chose to use cheater bacon bits rather than fry bacon. This. Is. So. Good!! It truly tastes like a baked potato. You could personalize this with any of your favorite baked potato toppings. I also chose to leave the skins on all my potatoes and chopped BEFORE boiling (seemed easier to me). THANKS for the recipe; this one's a keeper!",
