I think the recipe was supposed to instruct you to toss the vegetables in olive oil before putting them in the oven as 1/4 cup olive oil is listed in the ingredients (in addition to the oil for the dressing) and I have never roasted vegetables without tossing them in oil first. Great recipe Emily!",
