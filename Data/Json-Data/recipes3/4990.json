This is a great appetizer dish to prepare ahead of time as giving it time (overnight) allows all the flavors to mix. I Didn't have tostada shells so I used tortilla chips instead. I once used the lime juice in a plastic lime container and this worked fine. Just make sure you have enough lime juice to submerge all of the shrimp and stir/mix at least once or twice while the shrimp is \"cooking\"",
