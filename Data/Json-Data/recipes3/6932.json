I have worked in many kitchens on the Mediterranean side of Spain, and learned there how to make a mean tortilla.  There are two ways: with or without onions, and many restaurants offer both.  You can cook the potatoes and onions together, in a deep pan, adding a little more oil and draining it when it's done. You know the potatoes are done when they are soft enough to be broken by the weight of the spatula. The tortilla will come out moist and tender if the potatoes are just a bit mushy, but don't mash them.",

I always grate some manchego or parmesan cheese into it at this point too.   #4 = cook on low heat after you add the eggs.  #5 = when it is ready to flip over simply place a big plate on top of the pan, hold it in place, flip the pan over, put the pan back on top of the burner, and then slide the tortilla back into the pan.  Don't be scared, just do it with gusto!  Trust me, you can do it!\n\nSides: It tastes great with a side of cut tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt on them paired with a few slices of serrano.",

The ingredients don't need to be covered in the oil, just keep turning until they are all soft.  Then drain them before adding them to the egg mixture.  Let that mixture sit for about 10 minutes before placing in pan.  Now you only need to add enough oil to coat the pan.  don't forget to add oil again when you flip it.",
