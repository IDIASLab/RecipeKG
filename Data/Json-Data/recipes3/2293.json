I also topped them with gruyere cheese and parmesan before baking. FYI I made this 4 hours in advance,melted butter in a casserole placed them in the casserole and refrigerated until ready to bake and serve. Sooo easy and so many wows!",

I substituted sausage, used seasoned bread crumbs and put swiss cheese x's across the tops.  I also used a mini chopper to grind the sausage finely.  This really made the recipe simple, because I did not have to stand over the sausage chopping with a spatula to keep it from clumping into big pieces.  5 giant stars from me and my husbands super picky family!",

It makes a wonderful spread, so from now on I may just bake the filling in a casserole dish and serve as a dip.  5 stars plus!",

Definitely the fastest appetizer gone from the Thanksgiving spread!  Will definitely be making these again.  Also, I didn't have any chili powder so I just left it out.  :)",
