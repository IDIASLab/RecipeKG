My recipe cooks the tails, twice and the result is a crispy crackling covering the tail, that you can eat or save for crackling in cornbread.  The crushed red pepper can be used liberally for a spicy taste.  Be sure to buy pig tails that have a lot of meat around the upper part.",

Serve with some collard greens mac & cheese and cornbread and you'll slap yo' self for not making this sooner. This also works with fresh ham hocks but the pigtails are awesome.",
