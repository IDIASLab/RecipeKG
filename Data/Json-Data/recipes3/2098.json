I have made it twice now and will keep this super quick sauce recipe. I did decrease the amount of basil called for using only about half of the 1/2 cup. I also made the mistake of using crushed tomatoes the first time. The pieces were too small. The second time was much better with the whole tomatoes.",

For the water I heated 1/2 cup of tap water in the microwave and just threw in my leftover noodles to the sauce which really speeded up the process. My hubby did not want cheese on his so I simply used the Grated 100% Kraft Parmesan in the shaker container on my portion. Thank you for a quick and simple recipe!",
