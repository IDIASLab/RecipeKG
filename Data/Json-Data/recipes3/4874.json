These had a perfect texture-a delicate crispness outside with a tender inside exactly as both hash & waffles are supposed to be.  On our old wafflemaker (makes *aprox. 4x9\" sized* rectangular waffles) it made 3 waffles which is perfect for us.  My DH liked them with maple & Mrs. Butterworth Lite syrups, but he likes sausage w/ syrup, too.  I enjoyed them with just butter & can see adding garlic, thyme, & cayenne or hot sauce to the batter as well.  Wish I would've found this recipie while I was still in my 20s-pair this up with a white or cheese sauce & some eggs sunnyside up & you've got the perfect post-bar breakfast!",
