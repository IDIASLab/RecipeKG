I made a few changes: I sauted the onion in a bit of oil first and then added chicken breasts carrots and broth. When it came time to fry the chicken and carrots for 2 mins I did it in about a teaspoon of oil instead of one and a quarter cups. (I used a slotted spoon to get most of the chicken and carrots out fried them and then put them back into the pot with the broth.) I layered the rice and seasoning mixture on top of that. I also added about a cup of frozen peas and they worked really well with the recipe. I toasted the almonds in the toaster oven instead of in the oil. My modifications did change the overall presentation (more \"mixed\" chicken and rice than \"upside down\") but I cut almost 2 cups of oil from the recipe. And it was still really really good.",

This is a recipe I'll definitely use often - easy for weeknights. I read the reviews and mostly followed the recipe. I used 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts - the whole chicken parts with bones in would probably add flavor and have made it a bit better. I boiled the chicken carrots and onion in 4 cups chicken broth then reused the broth for cooking the rice. I sauteed the chicken and carrots in a few tablespoons of olive oil before adding the rice and I only added 2 1/2 cups rice after reading other reviews. This required 5 cups of liquid but I only had 4 cups of broth reserved after boiling the chicken so I added 1 cup of water to the rice mixture. Next time I'll only use 2 cups of rice so I can use the 4 cups of broth and make it more flavorful. I also like the idea of adding raisins and will try that in the future.",
