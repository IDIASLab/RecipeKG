After mixing in the egg soy milk and salt I had a thick goopy mess similar to biscuit mix. I have no idea how you could get a \"thin consistency\" unless you add at least twice as much liquid. I added an extra half cup of milk. When I added the corn I also added the corn liquid. I still could not get a good consistancy. The fritters were flavorless and I couldn't taste any curry --- just salt and flour. Sorry but I'll never be making these again.",

It was also missing some sort of leavening. Second time I added a tsp of baking powder to the batter but it was still missing something. A good basic concept but the proportions need work and there is a missing flavor component (like a little heat or citrus or something to brighten the flavor).",
