First of all when you are cooking the meat onions and garlic add some RUBBED SAGE CAYENNE PEPPER CUMIN and a small dash of PARSLEY FLAKES. This gives it much more flavor. I also used a half of a can of tomato paste instead of tomatoes. Add a can of kidney beans too...YUM! It does turn out a little mushy if that is not what you are looking for don't add the egg milk or cornmeal to the rest of the ingredients. Instead make a cornmeal batter (you can even use the boxed one--follow the recipe on the box) and poor the batter over the top so it will form a nice cornbread over the top. This will solve the mushy aspect (which I didn't mind so much)And yes it is rather ugly to behold....but give it a try. My husband wolfed it down.:). Hope that helps.",
