First off the eggplant must be soaked in cold salty water after being cubed for at least fifteen minutes then rinsed before cooking. This alleviates the stringy bitter toughness you often get with eggplant. I doubled the amount of mushrooms in this dish. I sauteed the onions and garlic together until translucent then added the mushrooms and eggplant together instead of cooking separately. I also splashed some white wine on them while they cooked. I'm pescetarian so I subbed vegetable stock for the chicken and cut the amount in half. The liquid cookoff from the veggies seemed pretty ample already! I added a cup of cooked brown rice in addition to the wild rice and it still seemed like there was more than enough liquid so I used only 1/4 cup of evaporated milk to replace the cream whisked it with the cream of mushroom (I used a lowfat version) and added that for the simmer. I also subbed 2 tsp. Greek seasoning for the Italian seasoning. I was going to top it with some crumbled feta but I was out so I garnished with a dollop of Greek yogurt and it was fantastic! Mine came out great and I give it a 4. Since I didn't follow the instructions exactly it is hard to rate this recipe but it seems as though it would have turned out overly liquidy with all that cream and stock considering I doubled the rice and the mushrooms and had to cut back on liquid.",

It was a nice creamy sauce I liked that texture after I doubled the amount of wild rice. The seasoning was great. On the other hand the canned soup flavor/stickiness didn't work that well here. I think a homemade bechamel would be a better flavor/texture balance if we are looking for creaminess. The eggplant was completely lost. If I didn't cook it myself I would never know eggplant was even in there. To recreate this better for me I would leave out the soup and make my own thinner lighter cream sauce. I loved the idea of eggplant with these ingredients so I plan to revisit this with the tweaks I mentioned.",
