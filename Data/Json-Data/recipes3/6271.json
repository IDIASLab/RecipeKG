However I did make some changes due to personal taste as well as what was on hand. I made a Quadruple batch so I used 4 large cukes 2 md white onions 5 Roma tomatoes 1 cup mayo 4 Tbl white vinegar 1 tsp salt 2 tsp pepper and 1 tsp minced garlic. I highly suggest that you whisk the dressing stuff first...then pour over the veggies and carefully stir. Otherwise it's not going to mix very well and it absolutely must sit for AT LEAST 1-2 hours before eating plus this is even better the next day as the flavors then have enough time to truly blend and set especially after the water is pulled from the tomatoes (which is what some people think is \"runny\" but that is actually your \"dressing\" so don't drain it! It has all your flavors in it!). I must say though you absolutely have to check/taste the cukes for wax if you buy from a grocery store. If you can't wash all the wax off then you must peel them completely or your salad will be extremely bitter.",
