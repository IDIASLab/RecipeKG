                "reviewBody": "Delicious! I'll be making this one again! I love that this uses corn instead of sugar to sweeten it. Next time I probably won't bother straining out the corn in the first step as it just seemed unnecessary. I'll probably just dump everything into the pot blend with an immersion blender then stir in the cream at the end. Also I'm not sure the cornstarch is even really necessary. I make a ton of creamy soups and have never needed to use it. The pumpkin and corn mixture combined with the cream are plenty thick on their own. I used freshly squeezed orange juice (about the juice of 1 orange) and that worked out perfectly. The coriander and nutmeg add a wonderful component. I swirled a bit of extra cream over the top and sprinkled nutmeg to serve. Thanks for the great recipe!",
