Next time I will score the skin side in a crosshatch pattern to allow the fat to render.  I also added some oil to the pan to sear it better. I used an oven-safe pan so that I didn't have to dirty a separate dish. The cook time was spot on for how I like duck cooked, but I would have liked a better sear on the skin so I put it under the broiler for two minutes. Next time I will adjust the sear/cook time a little. I will also use a little less salt. I also think you could save a step by just putting the garlic and rosemary into the meat right at the beginning, instead of after the sear and before putting in the oven. Will definitely make this again!",

I then made a rub of garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt and pepper and rubbed both sides and cooked skin side first allowing the meat side to sear in the duck fat. The most important thing is to make sure the breast is not over cooked. I did not cook it 10 minutes, but 5 minutes skin side up, flipped it and cooked it another 3 minutes skin side down. I served it with cauliflower/cheddar latkes topped with scallion and balsamic glazed brussel sprouts.\nYUMMY!",
