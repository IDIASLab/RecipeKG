Also I think there was way too much margarine; it made everything overly greasy. I suggest not using the margarine in the inside and perhaps even cutting the other 1/4 cup to less and dotting the chicken skin with it so that it browns more (my chicken skin did not brown and crisp as much as I would have liked). The \"stuffing\" was messy once the chicken was sliced so next time I'll use quartered onion and halved lemon.",
