I'm not a big fan of swiss cheese but it sounded like it would go perfectly with the veal chops I was going to cook and my suspicions were correct. I followed everything in this recipe and my sauce came out a bit too thick and grainy but no one made any complaints. I think I may end up cutting the Parmesan down to 3oz next time as I suspect that the Parm is my culprit for the grainy texture because I may have been a bit over 4oz. I ended up adding about 1/3 cup of milk to try and thin the sauce out a bit but with all that cheese it would have taken more to get it the consistency I wanted. I even cooked the roux longer to ensure it wouldn't thicken the sauce to a molasses like consistency with all that cheese but no luck. It may sound like complaints but I have nothing to really judge my sauce off of as I don't often eat french cuisine. Despite this batches shortcomings I'll be using this sauce again and again.",
