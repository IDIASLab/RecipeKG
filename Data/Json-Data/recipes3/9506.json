I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I'll do a couple of other things.  First, I'll try very hard to get my chicken pounded out a little more---I have such a hard time with that without getting holes in it---but maybe I just need to pound it out and then roll it with a rolling pin after it gets looser.  Second, I would use Papa's Seasoning Salt on the chicken before putting on the filling.  It needed just a little more seasoning I thought.  I wrapped one piece of bacon lengthwise because I was afraid of the filling coming out, and so I needed one more piece of bacon to wrap crosswise (in my opinion).  Hubby thinks I'm too picky, but that's just what I'll do the next time I make it.  Oh, one more important thing.  I didn't think one hour at 400 was going to work for me, so I did the first half hour at 350 and then moved it up.  That was perfect!  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!",

I also wrapped a piece of bacon lengthwise just in case any of that delicious cheese mixture wanted to try and escape.  It worked and the chicken was wondeful. I plan on testing out how to make this with the chicken cut in smaller pieces so it can be served as an appetizer.  I'm thinking I'll fold the chicken instead of rolling it.  Yum-yum!
