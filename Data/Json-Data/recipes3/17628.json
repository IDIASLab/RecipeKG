Instead of slicing the puff pastry roll and baking the slices I baked the whole roll and then obviously it didn t slice very well with cream cheese running all over the place...my bad! Today I used what I had in the fridge so that started with Dill Feta and Garlic Cream Cheese Spread (a recipe on this site which by the way was delicious in this particular recipe) instead of plain cream cheese. I didn t have quite enough ham so I added some salami as well. The taste on these pinwheels is delicious and my apologies to superchef for not following the directions. Next time I make these I promise to cook the way the recipe is written and post a better picture!",
