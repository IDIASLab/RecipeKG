The ones I had, I would have put on a sandwich, but they had to be doctored quite a bit for this sauce.  I love the idea of not have to wait hours, though, to have sauce.  I just used more sugar to tone down the sourness a bit, added some tomato paste because it is sweeter, upped the spices per the kitchen note, Italian sausage, because that's what my family likes, and ended up adding a little canned tomato sauce just to loosen it up, as my strained tomatoes were pretty thick.  Overall, love the recipe idea and using fresh ingredients.  Looking forward to summer and ripe tomatoes!",
