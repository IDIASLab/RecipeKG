I followed the tweaking given in the reviews used 3/4 cup buttermilk 1 1/4 tsp double acting baking powder and 4 over-ripe bananas. These were fluffy with the creamy banana in the middle and full of banana flavor plus they smelled fricken' awesome when cooking! Here's a hint people: when mashing the bananas use an actual \"masher\" not a blender or food processor. Also mix this by hand with a wisk not a hand mixer. That's how this becomes too liquidy. Don't over mix just mix until all the dry ingredients are incorporated and the batter is lumpy. Let the batter stand while you get your skillet heated up ( 1-3 minutes). Also make sure you grease your skillet or pan and use low to medium heat otherwise these will get burnt before they are done in the middle. Follow these tips and this recipe WILL be awesome! Next time I'm gonna put cinnamon and chopped nuts in it and it'll kick butt!",
