I think this replaces my box. I did add a TB of cream cheese in the cream phase (partly because I had 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy.) And I tossed in a little Dijon and garlic powder and left out pimentos (because I am a purist when it comes to Mac and cheese). So delicious. so easy. I will no longer go to the box. THANK YOU.",
