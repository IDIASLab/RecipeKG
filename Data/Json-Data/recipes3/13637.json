I used gluten free flour which has never been an issue with other crepes recipes that I have converted. Regardless the chicken filling is delicious. I wrapped the crepes in packets tying them with kitchen twine to serve them for a party. They were easier to dip into guacamole that way. I used Sarah's Easy Shredded Chicken Taco Filling. Thank you for the recipe.",

Well getting ready to make dinner and gathering the ingredients and looking up the recipe big oops not hamburger but chicken! Well as my husband says they aren't recipes for you they are just guidelines. So I made it with the beef threw in chopped black olives can of enchilada sauce can of chilies some kidney beans sour cream cheese spices and used that for the filling for the crepes. It was delicious. My husband raved and put it on his top ten list. Okay so the only thing I didn't change were the crepes but the crepes tasted so good with this bet they taste good with the chicken too.:-)",
