I used canned \"seasoned\" black-eyed peas and Hormel bacon bits instead of cooking bacon but it was fantastic! Definitely a keeper! It was SO easy too.

You can use fresh dried canned or frozen peas and it still taste great. I always cook my bacon pour some of the bacon fat from the skillet and saute the celery & onions in the remaining bacon fat. I then add to the pot of peas that are cooking. We love it hot and spicy but since there are still some little ones eating we serve the jalapeno on the side. Great recipe thanks!!",

I adjusted for personal taste: more garlic less tomatoes added a small can of diced green chilis some diced red bell pepper and diced ham. For simplicity I tossed everything in a crock pot and let it cook for several hours so the flavors would mingle. I served it right in the crock pot. SUPER EASY and delicious! Definitely a recipe to add to our favorites... Thanks!",
