I cut the Cayenne pepper back to 1.5 tsp. and added some plain yogurt at the end and it was still VERY spicy. I realize heat is a personal preference but this just seemed a bit much. It was also quite thick - I ended up adding water to thin out the sauce so I could simmer without scorching it. Aside from that this was super! My husband declared it \"really REALLY yummy.\" When we make it again we will probably cut the cayenne back to 1 tsp. We found that roasted vegetables (carrots broccoli onions and potatoes seasoned with olive oil salt pepper cumin and just a touch of cayenne) went with this very well.",

I generally use beef, prepare as directed, then add to my slow cooker with a can of diced tomatoes and a bit of water then set on low for 6 hours or so.

I added chopped cabbage leaves from the garden (but would use kale spinach or some such green). I did add about 1/4-1/2 cup of water after adding the leaves and then let it all simmer for about an hour. The last 5-10 minutes the lid was off to allow it to thicken slightly.
