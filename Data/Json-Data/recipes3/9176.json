                "reviewBody": "As we had an overly successful zucchini crop this year I was excited to find this recipe! My husband likes very few vegetables and he will eat squash so I'm always looking for tasty zucchini recipes. This is a very nice easy recipe that uses quite a bit of zucchini. Easy clean up too! (I was concerned the mixture would stick in the pie pan but it came right out cleanly.) I would have liked it to have been a little more set up on the interior - the moisture of the zucchini is probably a little bit of a variable - and of personal taste (I prefer egg dishes a little dryer.) I'll definitely be making this again with the addition of a little more \"baking mix\" I think. Also I doubled the \"Italian Seasoning\" and added additional garlic or it would have been extremely bland. There's a lot of potential here. I'm looking forward to experimenting with some additional ingredients. Aug 2017 -- We have another overwhelming zucchini crop so I pulled this recipe up and tried it again with the changes above which included an additional 3/4 C of Bisquick. I also squeezed as much liquid out of the shredded zucchini as possible. I browned crumbled and drained Italian sausage and used shredded mozzarella cheese along with doubling the seasonings. I greased 2 8\" pie pans with olive oil and divided the mixture between them baked for 35 minutes and they were PERFECT! We ate one and froze the other!",

I simply skipped the salt and oil and only added about 1/4 C any low fat cheese. I also drained the zucchini. Have added fresh cilantro and other spices as well to change it up.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion to add more of the biscuit mix--well I didn't have more so I used the cup of Bisquick that I had plus another 3/4 cup of flour and 1/2 tbs. of baking powder.  I also did not use as much salt or oil as the original recipe called for. I probably used a tablespoon or so of olive oil and a few sprinkles of salt. Instead of a pie pan, we used a classic 13 x 9 pan so things wouldn't bubble over. I must say it is important to squeeze the shredded zucchini as much as possible even if it seems tedious. Great recipe overall. Thanks for sharing!! Next time I may add onions or sweet peppers.",
