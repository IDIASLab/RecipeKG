Divide 4 cups of the dry ingredients into zip bags so you don't have to measure again. To each batch, stir in 3 c of milk and 3 eggs (add more water/milk to get the right consistency).  I don't need to know how many are coming.  The dry bag ingredients can be frozen till the next breakfast. To me, this is superior to mixes.",
