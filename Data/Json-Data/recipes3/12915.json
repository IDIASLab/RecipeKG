I much prefer this type of lasagna to the heavy cheese and sauce laded versions you usually find. I use a mixture of Parmigiano Reggiano and either Percorino or Asiago. I also like to use the no-boil lasagna noodles which makes it lighter and is more like using fresh pasta sheets.",

I made it to 12 servings because that is what size the meat came in and I used a cheese blend instead of just Parmesan but kept everything else as is. I was a little skeptical when I could smell the cinnamon when the meat was simmering but the taste was fabulous. This will definitely be added to my lasagna rotation (yes I cook enough of the to have their own rotation haha).",
