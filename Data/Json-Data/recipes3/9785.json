This got me through many nights traveling in Guatemala and Mexico on a very limited budget. I still like to make it even with a full kitchen because it reminds me of camping at the Mayan ruins. The tuna with oil is preferable, and if the avocado is good quality and ripe, you might not even need any salt.",

I really want to experiment more with this recipe by adding spices to olive oil and then mixing that in with tuna packed in water. Not a huge fan of the IDEA of packed in vegetable oil although the taste was great. Anyway thanks for this new idea! edit: My new favorite way to eat this is by mixing in a few chipotle peppers in adobo sauce with the tuna.",

I believe they mixed chopped onions and tomatoes into the tuna with olive oil before  filling the avocado, then sprinkling with finely chopped cilantro and a small dollop of mayo. They then placed the filled avocado over a bed of lettuce with slices of firm boiled potatoes with a drop of mayo on each. Funny combination, but I got hooked! They call it \"Palta Rellena\".",
