I did not double the dressing and it covered everything just perfect.  I could not really taste the dill or pepper, so I may add more of each of those.  Also, I added another can of tuna - there was no way 1 can was enough with all that pasta!",

Also in reading the other reviews I'm pretty sure the recipe was supposed to say 2 cups of uncooked pasta. It looks like one reviewer thought that was how much cooked pasta should be used.",
