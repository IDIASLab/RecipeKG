I used Rao's marinara sauce and served these over shirataki noodles. Delicious! This is going in my regular rotation! The only thing I would suggest is if you are serving these over shirataki noodles so use a bit more tomato sauce. I will also try these over mashed cauliflower but they'd also be tasty on their own!",
