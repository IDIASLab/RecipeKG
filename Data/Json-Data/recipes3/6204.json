Wasn't sure about what to do with them after I poured the pickling liquid into the jars so I just put lids on them and into the fridge they went. I uploaded a photo on 5.20.15 but I just knew that I couldn't wait 6 weeks to sample these onions. So I'm coming clean with you I cheated and opened a jar today. Seriously the best pickled onions I've ever had. The thing that makes this recipe unique is the malt vinegar and the hot chili peppers. I not only added some crushed peppers to each jar I added a couple of the whole dried chilis. That malt vinegar-chili pepper combination is just crazy good. I vow to never not have these on hand in my fridge. Hmmmm wonder how those onions would be in a very dry gin martini (is that called a Gibson??). Five-star recipe in this house!",
