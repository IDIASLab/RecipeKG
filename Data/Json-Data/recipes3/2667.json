I will decrease the amount of oil and/or butter by about 25-50% because there were pools of oil on the top of the sauce at the end. I will also use a combination of half and half and milk combined with flour to thicken the sauce instead of heavy cream. The mushrooms I added were a great addition. This is a great recipe for company!",
