This is very tasty and easy to make if you have a onion slicer (its like an apple one) you just put on onion and push down.  I would recommend trying the ice bath with onion to get to bloom open more.  I got mine to bloom but not quite as much as I had hoped.  You want to make sure your grease is 350 and you want to fry it core down first then flip if your grease does not submerge the whole onion.  DO cook for the 10 Min.. I thought mine was done at 7... but no, its not because it wont peel off to eat if not tender...We had a lot of fun making this.  We only made one and I have left overs for another one.  Dont skip the refrigeration part of the onion.  THE DIP:  Well lets just say you should put everything in the bowl excep the \"horsey\" and add it 1tsp at  a time to your liking.  I had pure horsradish and my son was making the dip, we ended up doubling everything but the horsey and it was still a little to much for us. Thank you for the recipe. Take a look at my pics and you will see the cutter I am talking about. ",
