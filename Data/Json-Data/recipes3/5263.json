I would have never put all those flavors together. I just sauteeded my chicken in some olive oil and salt and pepper in piece I did not flour it. I think that \"Italian Sausage\" would be good in this recipe also. I chopped up my veggies as I wanted the kid to eat them but he still found them. He loved the flavor though.. I only made 1/2 because there is two of us. If you are looking for this to have more sauce I would double the cream and maybe the parm. THANKS SO MUCH.. LOVE IT!! N R...",

I would say to add more veggies and if you want sauce you need to add more cream as 1 cup is not enough. I use 2 cups of cream with 3/4 box of the fettuccine. All in all it is worth making and I will be making this again it is a quick week night recipe.",
