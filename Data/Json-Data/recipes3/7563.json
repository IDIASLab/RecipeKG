I used two pounds of cooked tail meat and the sauce was just the right amount to cover. Another problem I had was that one of those pounds of crawfish were frozen from a boil we'd had earlier and were very spicy. The other pound was purchased and had no seasoning at all. Even after cooking...one bite had good flavor then another bite was rather bland. If unseasoned tailmeat is used I'd suggest at least a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning to be added. Also more celery and perhaps more bell pepper would add as well. As is this recipe barely makes a four.",
