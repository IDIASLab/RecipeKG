The asparagus perfectly cooked crisp tender and had a lot of flavor. I used plain goat cheese because that is what I had in the fridge but I think the herb variety would be even better. I will make again but I think next time I will add the goat cheese just the last few minutes instead of cooking the entire time. Thanks for the recipe!",
