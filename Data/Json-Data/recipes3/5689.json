We only had French bread to soak up the sauce, and I think it would be good to cook some pasta with the remaining sauce and add a little butter to it.  I did let kosher salt and pepper sit on the fish for a half an hour before cooking time.  The juice from a lemon should be about 1/4 cup.  Thanks for a nice recipe.",
