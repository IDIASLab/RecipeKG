The veggies were willing and waiting at about the time the potatoes were done. I did need to add much more milk - I think by the time it was said and done I had used a total of 2 1/2c of milk. Also I added apprx 2oz of Velveeta cheese a small handful of bacon bits a few dashes of dried parsley and S&P. Stirred together until the cheese was melted and all was heated through. My family was very pleased with the soup and my daughter had 3 small bowl! Thanks Tina for the basic easy & tasty recipe!",

I had a half can of cream of celery to use up so I added it and it added an additional layer of flavor. I liked that the celery and carrots were still slightly crunchy. I'm not fond of mush. I also added a small hunk of Velveeta (probably about 1 ounce) to the soup at the end right before serving. I will make this soup again.",
