The thinner you can slice the plantain, the better; I have used a mandolin-type slicer in the thinnest setting possible. You can do it with a sharp knife, but it takes forever and can be tricky.  We also sometimes let them stand in salty water for 10-15 min and drain them well before frying but if you do that you have to dry them off or you could have hot oil splatter everywhere. Make sure you fry them until crisp without overbrowning. If the plantain has started to turn (rippen), the flavor will be sweeter. If it feels soft, it is too ripe for this recipe - you can fry it, but it will be a different texture and flavor.",
