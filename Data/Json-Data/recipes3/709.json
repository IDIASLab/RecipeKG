I used butter instead of margarine and used 2 tablespoons less than the recommended 1 cup and it still came out fine. I couldn't find cherry chips so I substituted chopped maraschino cherries. The dough was a bit dry and wouldn't stick together so I added about 2 teaspoons of the maraschino cherry liquid with the chopped cherries. Because of the dryness of the dough, I found that I had to scoop some up in my hand and press them into balls before placing them on the cookie sheet. I also left the cookies in the oven for about 5 minutes longer. The oats give this cookie a nice crunchy texture. Thumbs up.",
