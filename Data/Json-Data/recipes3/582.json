                "reviewBody": "Balsamic vinegar is rarely more than 1/4 cup for a LARGE recipe b/c of it's pungent flavor. Some common sense adaptations on the part of this long-time cook were to add 1/4 balasamic vinegar and 1/2 cup red wine (a good flavored shiraz was what I used) instead of the measurements of red wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar given in the recipe. Also 2 Tbsp. oregano will give an overpoweringly strong oregano flavor. Substituting fresh basil and omitting the oregano altogether was also another no-brainer substitution. We also added some reconstituted sun-dried tomatoes (1/4 cup dry or 1/2 cup reconstituted) chopped and some sliced mushrooms (we used portabella's due to their mild flavor and ability to hold up to high heat & long cook times). After making those changes this recipe was fantastic! A lot of the previous reviews claim too strong a vinegar flavor which makes sense when you take the strongest flavored vinegar on the planet add too much and then cook it down to make it even MORE so.",

I followed the advice of others and used 1/4 c. balsamic vinegar along with 1/3 c. of red wine vinegar. I mixed this in with 1/2 c. chicken broth and poured it over the chicken after it had browned. I also added a dash of basil with the oregano and 2 teaspoons of Italian dressing. Also I did not have a fresh onion on hand so I used dried minced onion. It was great served with garlic mashed potatoes and black-eye peas. I will make it again!",
