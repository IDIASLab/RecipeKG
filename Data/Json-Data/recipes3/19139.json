I didn't have any liquid lecithin (a binder) so I used one teaspoon dry guar/xanthan gum another binder per cup of flour (a total of 2 t.) and upped the \"milk\" by 2 T. Also I didn't have arrowroot powder so I used cornstarch which is similar in property. I have to admit I was a little hesitant to add cinnamon to the recipe since this is not a dessert bread but I did anyway and it was wonderful! This would still be a wonderful bread without the cinnamon. The texture was a little crumbly so I am going to make this again and I will add an extra tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot and I think I'll try it without the cinnamon and see if it makes a good sandwich bread. Thanks so MUCH for this recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I made a loaf a few days ago with a few changes because of soy allergy. I subbed almond milk for soy xanthan gum for lecithin and garbanzo bean flour for soy flour. Some had complained of crumbly bread so I added a tablespoon of ground flax with 2 T. water. The batter was quite wet but I went ahead with it. On second thought I would add a little more flour for a drier batter. I thought the loaf was done after 40 minutes since it was brown and a toothpick came out clean but definitely should have left it in longer. I let it cool put it in the fridge and started slicing it the next day. It has a fabulous taste but I find the bread to be a little too dense. However I'm going to try this again since I made some errors and work on making a less dense loaf because the taste is worth it. The tiny bit of cinnamon and a flavorful local honey make it a real pleasure to eat.",

I checked it at 40 min. and it was already done- 35 min. early. The recipe said the batter would be stiff. It was runny. So I added flour until it was somewhat stiff. I did make a few minor changes to fit my diet but I don't think the changes altered the recipe enough to cause the batter to be runny. I used rice milk instead of soy extra brown rice flour to replace the soy flour and agave nectar instead of honey.",
