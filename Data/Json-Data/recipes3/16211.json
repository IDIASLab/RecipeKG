I usually follow the recipes as written but in this case I simply had to add some sliced onions in with the apples. It was a good addition. After browning the chops I saut\u00e9ed the onions and apples. Removed those and then added some white wine to the pan (rather then open a whole container of chicken broth) then added the thinly sliced potatoes and let them simmer a little (nothing worse then over cooked pork with under cooked veggies). Then proceeded as written. I was tempted to add a bit of sage or something but resisted.  It does not knock your socks off but quite simply is what it is!",
