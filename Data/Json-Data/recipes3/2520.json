I decided to make spiral cookies instead of the checkerboard pattern so I rolled each type of dough out a little thinner (roughly 6 X 10) than in the original recipe put the pistachio rectangle on top of the chocolate one and rolled it up (from the longer side) to form a \"log\" of spiralled dough. After refrigerating I sliced the dough 1/4\" thick and baked the cookies about 11 minutes. The cookies themselves are pretty tasty--not too sweet. I added a little almond extract to the pistachio dough which made them a little more flavorful I think. These cookies are certainly visually striking!",

Also to cut down on fat I used 3/4 cup butter for each colored dough and you cannot even tell the difference. Also - chill them in the freezer; they don't chill very well in the fridge even after 2 hours.",

It roughly took me 14 to 15 minutes to get them properly done. 5 drops of food coloring is also not enough to notice a green colour in the cookies when the baking is done. The calculator for the servings is off in the metric systeem. In the US version the amount of sugar used is more than the in Metric.",
