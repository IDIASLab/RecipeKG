A few things i would do in the future would be: a) start out at a higher temp to seal the juices in. b) put some hickory or apple chips in to add a smoked flavor. c) if you have a gas BBQ put some briquets into a metal container and burn them as well to add the unmistakably great BBQ flavor.",

Will try this again but next time I will take it off when the internal temperature is about 125 degrees F... remember that it continues cooking during that 20 minute rest before slicing. This seems especially true when cooking on a rotissary or grill probably because the direct heat makes the outside of the meat hotter than when cooking in an oven. Also if you want some well done and some rare set the rotissary on high instead of medium and cook to internal temp of 120F to 125F: This should result in well done outside slices and rare inside slices.",
