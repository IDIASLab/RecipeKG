Basically like what some would use for a meat loaf mixture. Also I brown a chopped onion with about 4-6 slices of bacon and add to the meat/rice mixture. When you boil the cabbage leaves save the water that it is cooked in and use instead of chicken broth. My mother in law insists on this step! Great to make a day ahead of company and reheat the flavors are even better:)",

To perk up the flavor I used 4 cloves of garlic. I also seasoned the meat well when cooking with onion powder garlic powder a pinch of celery seed salt and pepper. To the meat/rice mixture I included a few splashes of V8 (until moistened). To the tomatoes I substituted the chicken broth for water in which the cabbage was cooked in. I also added approximately a cup of V8 to the tomato sauce. I only made one pan and it cooked perfectly in 1.5 hours. Served with sour cream and it made a delightful meal with plenty of left overs.",

Because some of the other reviewers said it came out bland I did add some spices to the meat mixture as well as the can of V8 others suggested. I put in Basil Rosemary and a little extra dill weed. I also omitted the extra 1 1/2 pounds ground beef and was able to squeeze it all in one pan. I didn t have veal and didn t want to completely overwhelm the pork flavor with too much beef. My husband loved the way it came out. I was looking for a Sarmale recipe because he is from Romania but this came pretty close. The cabbage just isn t as salty as Sarmale but the meat was delicious. oh one more thing! I would recommend serving with a dollop of sour cream. It really adds to the flavor.",

As for the critical review this recipe is very traditional except for the sage pork sausage and comes from poor regions in the old country (Europe) and is bland because there was very little money for anything. I like to perk up the flavor myself. For a recipe this size here's how first don't drain the meat dry in a colander leave some fat in use at least 1-tsp salt in the meat in the sauce add the following 2-tsp salt 1/3 cup brown sugar and my secret ingredient is ketchup to taste about 3/4c. However you could also use 1/4 to 1/2c apple cider vinegar or a(small or large) can of sour kraut instead of ketchup. The ketchup vinegar or kraut really step up the flavor and give that little twang to the taste buds. I feel the need here to remind people start with less you can always add more.",
