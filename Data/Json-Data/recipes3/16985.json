I had a large chicken breast so I sliced it lengthwise into two pieces Thinking that 1 hour at 400\u00baF would be too long I set the timer for 30 minutes checked the temp and it already was at 194\u00baF. It was so dry and overcooked that I actually threw part of it away. I will try this again simply because what was edible actually tasted pretty good. I love the ease of preparation and this would be a good choice for a weeknight meal but in the future I ll start checking the temperature at 10-15 minutes. I did not have peach preserves so I used orange marmalade and this recipe definitely has potential just needs that cooking time cut waaaaay back!",
