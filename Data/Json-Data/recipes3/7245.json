Made it again (again absent bacon) the following weekend using Tuna steak and Cannellini beans and -- while not especially embraced -- was better received. In the VERY unlikely event I ever attempt this recipe again (regardless of the fish/seafood I attempt) I think I'll attempt adding some rice and some salt to the general recipe and sprinkling either grated Parmesan and/or Cheddar Cheese over each individual serving. My family (4 adults me) did not care for this recipe.",
