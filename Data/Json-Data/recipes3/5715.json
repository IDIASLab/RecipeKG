When you squeeze out the water from the potatoes into a bowl let it sit for a minute then drain off the water carefully and at the bottom of the bowl you will find the starch from the potatoes. Take that and return it to the grated potatoes this will help to hold them together. I like to serve them with fried salt pork onion (fried nice and brown) and cream mixture. Just pour it over the dumplings after they are cooked and enjoy! Yummy! Yummy! P.S. Also adding some evaporated milk to the potatoes will keep them white.",

The Lithuanian language gives gender to the noun. Kugelis is a masculine word ending it with an \"a\" would change it to a feminine word and therefore it is incorrect. But thanks for sharing the recipe..it's a pretty good one. For anyone who thought it was bland..yeah it's supposed to be that way all Lithuanian food is bland and there is never ever any kind of cheese or garlic salt in Kugelis.",
