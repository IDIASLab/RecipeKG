BUT to make it serve-worthy, I suggest the following additions: 1-2 hard boiled eggs, 1/2 c finely diced celery, 2 tablespoons sweet relish, 1 c thawed peas, & a couple shakes of celery salt.  Also, use a bit less dill than suggest.  (I used 1 1/2 teaspoons.)  Do not leave out the pickle juice and use a good, homemade kosher dill brand for best results.  I used a little more than suggested (3-4 tablespoons). Finally, do not eat it right away: Let the flavors marry for at least 2 hours (simply follow directions). Whew...That seems like a lot, but it's really not too complicated.  My husband, co-workers, & I all enjoyed it.  It's simple, keeps for a long time, healthy (if you use light mayo & skim milk, which I did), & cost-effective.",
