I altered the ingredients a bit to what I had I used 4 oz of each by weight of fresh mushrooms red pepper onion pork sausage and cheddar cheese. For seasoning I used onion powder garlic powder Mrs Dash herb and garlic and black pepper. I used my # 50 scoop which yielded 19 muffins that baked in 20 minutes. I did not use liners just sprayed the muffin pans really good with Pam spray. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #FacelessNoMore",
