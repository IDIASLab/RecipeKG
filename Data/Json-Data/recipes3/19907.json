The steak was so tender and it smelled amazing while it was cooking. The only changes I made was to use diced tomatoes instead of crushed,and zucchini instead of the pepper, just because that's what I had on hand and they worked perfectly. I served this over egg noodles with grated cheese and even my picky toddler ate some!! Thanks Melissa for a dish I'll be making very frequently!",

Additionally you can further perk it up by adding almost any variety of canned tomato.

All in all I thought it was very good and I'll certainly make it again.",
