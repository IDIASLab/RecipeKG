My burgers fell apart in my pan since i am not a very good burger cook. So i chopped all of the ground meat up Hamburger Helper-style. The aroma was interesting but i wasn't totally convinced that it was going to be very good until all was cooked through. In a spur of the moment inspiration i tossed the meat over 2 pieces of naan bread topped it with a slice of pepper jack cheese and popped them in the oven for a few minutes for an open-faced melt. WHOA!!! AWESOME! My side dish was Cameroonian Fried Spinach (another member recipe) which i botched so it was kinda gross. But my intentions were pure! I will definitely do this again and hopefully perfect the spinach recipe since they seem like they would go so well together on those nights when i'm craving something easy yet non-Western. Thanks for the recipe!",
