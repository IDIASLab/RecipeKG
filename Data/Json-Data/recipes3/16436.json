The next time I make this recipe I will use half the required onion use a sweet white onion only 1 clove of garlic and probably only 1/3 cup mayo and 1/3 cup sour cream. The taste of the onions are still on my tongue 12 hours later after brushing twice rinsing with mouth wash twice and eating mints. Yikes.",
