For a glaze I made a powdered sugar glaze and then added the same amount of caramel syrup (for ice cream) and drizzeled it over top. Fabulous!",

I cut the sugar back by 1/3 cup (I also used granulated instead of icing sugar - 2C). I increased the apples to 3 medium granny smiths - but didn't chop them fine enough. I should have added the whole bag of caramels too. I note that there is no leavening agent in the recipe which is why most are saying that it is heavy. 2 tsp of baking soda fixed that - the cake is not heavy. I also added 1/2 tsp of salt for flavoring. The cake is not too sweet now so I am adding a caramel frosting to improve the flavor.",
