I spent a lot of time searching the web and all data points to you ADD the water from the can of corn.  ADD THE WATER!  lol  I have made this recipe numerous times and it is best as written WITH the corn water.  If you don't want to add it I've done things like up the sour cream, add an extra egg, more corn bread mix.  When you do that it turns out just like corn bread.  The recipe as written I serve with a spoon.  It's bread-like, but not like regular corn bread.  Now for the taste.  Phenomenal.  Not one person in my family doesn't love this dish.  It makes a lot, but no matter what it is all gone.  This is great for any holiday meal or any general everyday of the week meal.  My family is always thrilled when they see me making this dish.  Thank you!  Wish I could give it 10 stars!",

We weren't sure what to serve with this and had it by itself. It was great but next time we will serve steak or some kind of meat with it since it kind of covers the veggie and bread for the meal. Wasn't sure whether to add the juice from the canned corn or not. I went ahead and DRAINED it before adding the corn and it turned out moist and delicious. If you are looking for more of a corn pudding type of recipe you might wanna go ahead and add the juice with it. Overall a great recipe.",
