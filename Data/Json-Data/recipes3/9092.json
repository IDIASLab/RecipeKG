Cook\u2019s Illustrated suggested replacing pancetta with bacon, but recommended blanching it in boiling water for 2 minutes, so  that\u2019s what I did.  Doing this removes some of the fat from the bacon, so it browned up more quickly.  Both the soy and hot sauces were good additions and really set this apart from other fried cabbage recipes.
