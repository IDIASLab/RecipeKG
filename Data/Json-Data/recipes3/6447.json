                "reviewBody": "The flavor of the meat in this recipe is really good but the cooking time is way way WAY off!!! At 45 minutes my leg of lamb which was only THREE pounds was only about half done. I think the recipe meant to say cook 45 minutes turn and cook 45 minutes more. That'd be more accurate though I'm still thinking it'd be a pretty rare dish. It took almost 2 hours for mine to cook. My family (including my carnivorous dad) really thought it came out very moist and loved the flavor though so I will make it again just keeping in mind that it takes a lot longer to cook. The gravy is kind of grainy because of the bread crumbs but the meat almost doesn't need it. Next time I may just add some beef broth to the drippings and thicken it a bit and call it good.",

First of all a 5 pound lamb serves a lot more than 4 people unless you're feeding sumo wrestlers. Second of all like a turkey or other roast you can't fully cook 5 pounds of meat in 45 minutes. You do need about 1 hour per pound of meat. In light of needing about 5 hours to cook I recommend that you add the bacon somewhere in the last 1/2 hour of cook time.",

I used red wine instead of white and I thought the entire thing was amazing. I also sprinkled \"Herbs de Provence\" all over the lamb before putting the bacon on it and it was spectacular! My piece of lamb was only 1.4 lbs but I used a thermometer and set it for 140 F. It was PERFECT! Just the right amount of pink and OH SO GOOD!!! I paired it with an Israel couscous pilaf and some roasted broccoli carrot and cauliflower mix. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",
