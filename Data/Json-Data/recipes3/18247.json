I took the advice of others and used Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien.  I used one extra egg and 2% evaporated milk.  I used cheddar cheese vs. pepper jack. For people who complained that this was not \"spicy\" enough, it's a breakfast casserole it's not supposed to be filled with a bunch of spices unless you want heartburn all day.  This is a great recipe because of its versatility.  You can substitute another breakfast meat for the ham or put some in addition, add veggies such as chopped fresh tomatoes or mushrooms.  You could also change the pepper jack cheese to whatever cheese blend you prefer.  It's up to you.  I would suggest making the recipe once first then play around with it.  It's definitely a keeper!  I served it with fresh fruit, toast, and bagels. ",

This turned out just OK; not great but not bad either; just kinda ho-hum.  I usually make a breakfast casserole that uses crescent rolls and no potatoes that I love and I think I will continue use it instead of this recipe.  I think the combinatin of the evaporated milk and the potatoes gave this a strange texture that we did not care for.  Not really sure why the recipe calls for the evporated milk instead of just using regular milk.  This also took much longer to cook than stated in the recipe.  I had to bake it for an hour and 30 minutes before the center set up.  Sorry, this one is not a keeper.",

We keep a kosher home so instead of ham or bacon I substituted chopped frozen (defrosted and drained) spinach. It was delicious.
