This also depends on what flavoring you use in the fondant.:) I didn't have light corn syrup so I used dark. The color was modified to a light brown but was perfect because I will be making rock candy geodes. Anyway it was a great consistency and if you need it to be firmer just add more cornstarch.:)",

This was my first time making or using fondant and this recipe did the trick. I appreciated the simple ingredients too. I did experience some cracking with mine. I used the fondant to make flowers to decorate a cake mostly rolling it cutting out shapes and then molding those shapes. The largest flower was about 4\" across and cracked slightly at the interior corners of the petals though it still held together. To avoid this I would advise that you gradually add extra cornstarch and powdered sugar; I made one of my batches a little too dry and that one had problems with cracking. I think getting the right consistency just takes practice. I didn't have clear vanilla so I used a spare amount of vanilla extract as well as a generous splash of almond flavoring.",
