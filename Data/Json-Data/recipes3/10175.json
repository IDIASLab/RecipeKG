                "reviewBody": "I have really enjoyed this jerky and think it is perfect. My kids like it too. I took other's recommendations and only used 1 teaspoon of salt per pound and that has worked well. I have deviated just slightly. First I included in the 1 Tsp. salt some \"Curing Salt No. 1\" that I bought on the internet. It is intended to help the meat last longer and since I have been eating the jerky within a couple weeks I probably don't need it. However I do store it at room temp in my desk at work to snack on so I will continue adding it. Second I have been smoke cooking the jerky in my smoker for four or five hours until it reaches the right dryness. Not hard and crunchy but having just a little moisture left. This is also probably not necessary as I have prepared ground jerky in the oven before using purchased mixes and they were good without the addition of smoke cooking. Third I am using ground venison. I recommend the addition of 1 pinch cayenne pepper per pound. I left it out on my first batch and my impression was that it needed more pepper. So I added the recommended 1 pinch and it was perfect. By the way I have a measuring spoon set that includes \"1 pinch\" and have used that. I tried rolling it out between two sheets of wax paper. It works fine but I have gone back to squeezing it out of a jerky gun. I have tried both flat strips and round. My kids like the round jerky the best and it seems to load up the tray better. I think they like round from eating purchased round jerky.",

I'm really surprised how good this is for using cheaper meat. I'm definitely saving this and coming back to improve it to my taste over time. (Perhaps less garlic/onion and a bit more spice.)
