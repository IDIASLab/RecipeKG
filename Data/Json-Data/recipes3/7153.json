                "reviewBody": "This soup was excellent and an superb way to use up our Christmas Eve prime rib.  My family of 7 loved it and I loved the idea of not wasting a single ounce of an expensive prime rib (including the bones).  Made as directed, but next year I will try simmering the bones in my crockpot overnight and then the next day doing the reduction.  This might save on time because like another reviewer stated this took longer time period to reduce than the recipe called for.  Since there were no measurements on the amount of water to cover on the bones, this time would vary person to person, depending on how much water they used.   I simmered for about 2.5 hours on the stove and then finally ended up just boiling to reduce.  Hence my idea to use my crockpot next time then either do a boiled reduction or do a simmering reduction.  Thanks Emily!  It was a hit with all 5 of my kids, and it was a hit with me because I finally have an awesome recipe to us with prime rib leftovers.",

                "reviewBody": "Loved this recipe. I had a 12 pound prime rib so I had 5 bones. I upped the recipe accordingly. I also knew I would want more meat so I cleaned and cubed a steak sized portion to add to the ribs so we could have more meat in the dish. So I guess I made it a stew/soup. Yes it is time consuming, but what good soup or stew isn't.  Because I heavily season my prime rib roasts, I waited until after I added all the cooked ingredients before adding any salt or pepper. I did not add mushrooms because even though I love everything else, that is one thing this cook doesn't eat! lol I also chopped about three quarters of a bunch of green onions and threw them in about 5 min before it were finished to get some of the flavor into the soup.  Bottom line is... the flavors were great, it was worth the effort and I look forward to making it again after my next prime rib. Thank you Emily!",
