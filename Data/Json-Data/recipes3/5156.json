Green peppers tend to have a stronger flavour so try substituting red peppers or better yet..roasted peppers!! Bottled Italian dressing is usually salty pungent and generally nasty. Suggest that a vinaigrette such as Dijon Lemon or Balsamic be used as a better tasting and wonderful alternative. Throwing in some chopped sun dried tomatoes is also a nice addition. Pasta salad is so versatile that it lends itself to a variety of additions.",

Also subbed canned asparagus for the fresh(none to be found at the market) a roasted red pepper for the green(more mellow taste) regular hothouse tomato instead of cherry(ditto on the lack thereof) frozen broccoli florets(added to pasta water) added a few secret spices of my own and used asiago cheese(more mellow flavor and not EIGHT DOLLARS A POUND!). After sampling sold for 25 at our Kiwanas auction. Definately a keeper with tweaking!",

I didn't have any tomatoes. I used a little parm and shredded low fat monterey jack. For the dressing I cut it in half and did a 1/4 cup honey mustard and 1/4 light zesty Italian dressing. I chilled it and when we got home from a late evening in church we had a wonderful dinner!",
