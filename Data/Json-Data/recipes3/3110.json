I used a package of chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, 1/3 Cup frozen corn, and roughly the same amount of chopped carrots and celery.  Did add about 2 tsp cornstarch to the half&half before adding it, and followed the Bisquick box directions for dumplings.  Perfection!  Licking our chops still!  Thank you for the great recipe!",
