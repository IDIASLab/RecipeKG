It's a tad time-consuming but it's easy to make. The chicken turned out very tender. I used only one very large sweet onion because that's all I had on hand. The amount of black pepper as written produces a very peppery dish as a warning. Try this recipe!!!!",

I made a few changes to accomodate what I had on hand. I used 1 large onion 1 zucchini no squash no rosemary because I forgot it:) I didn't use tomato sauce I used a can of diced tomatoes and half a jar of spaghetti sauce. It is peppery as another reviewer said but that was a plus for me. It does take a bit of time but just boil up some pasta and you have a fairly easy delicious one-dish dinner. Oh and it took about an hour in Calphalon dutch oven for me so I'd definitely check before letting it go 90 minutes. Will definitely make many more times.",
