In that recipe they add some chopped red pepper, red onion instead of white, and don't use garlic.  So, I use red onion, add chopped red pepper, and omit the garlic.  It is very refreshing, and I now have mango salsa cravings!  Hint:  If you don't want to peel and dice mangos, many grocery stores have bags of chopped mango in the frozen fruit section, however it is a little pricey. ",
