First, as other reviewers did; I did a rough chop of the broccoli and put in the pot with the potatoes.  Also, in the same vein of decreasing number of dirty dishes; I used an immersion blender to pur\u00e9e in the pot.  As I didn't have any cheddar cheese, I used about 1/4 c Monterey Jack and about 1/2 c of Parmesan. I also added a little fresh dill as I had it and I love dill.  All in all, a good recipe to customize based on preferences and what you have in the house.",
