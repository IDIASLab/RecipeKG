Also didn't have the mushroom soup so used onion soup mix and added about 2/3 cup of water in addition to the 1 1/4 cup of Marsala. Added a splash of Marsala wine near the end of cooking to give it a little kick! Served it over rice with a fresh salad. Delicious!!!",

I had never sauteed mushrooms until tonight. It all went well. I used chicken tenders and cooked for about 25 minutes. I tasted them after finishing them and added a little bit of garlic salt, which was a great addition. I also used 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning and more butter than the recipe mentioned. Good groceries!  Update 2/25/18. Made it again. Used a little over a tablespoon of seasoning in the flour and added garlic salt and black pepper to my taste. Also used 2 cans of the golden mushroom soup, which helped balance out the strong marsala taste. It produced a good blend between the soup and wine flavors.",

I followed it almost exactly except that I added only 3/4 cup of the wine because I've got kids. I know that it gets cooked out but you never know. Needless to say, this will be in rotation and maybe even replacing something much more mundane like souperior meatloaf. I'm very glad that I tried it. Oh, and one more thing, both of my picky  kids rated it a ten.",

After browning I put in oven on 350 to keep warm while cooking other items. Also used good chicken broth thickened with corn startch for the wine mixture. Simmered for about 40 minutes. Turned out great. Thicker meat slightly increased cooking time. Surely well worth the time. Great week night dinner.",
