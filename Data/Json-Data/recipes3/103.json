The thinner cheaper bacon crisps up way better, and the thick stuff stays soggy. Also, we don't even bother with terriyaki inside the rollups and it's still delicious. Instead you can dip them into a dip of your choice after cooking, and we usually choose warmed BBQ sauce. My mom used to put a dab of ketchup in there while rolling up, which also adds a yummy sweet touch without being overwhelming. Try these!",
