I don't tend to salt my food at the table and prefer things less salty but this could use about another 1/2 tsp. I decided to slice my meat instead of shred and that made it better for burritos. Next time I'll add more salt and more cayenne to give it a bit more bite.",

Making the above adjustments I will be doing this again.  I served this burrito style with black beans and cilantro rice with fresh tomato salsa and guacamole.",
