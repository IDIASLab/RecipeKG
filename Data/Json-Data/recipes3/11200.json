Since we like spicy-hot \nfoods, I substituted the 1 tbsp of Chili powder with 2 tbsp of a recipe from this site, \"Homemade Taco \nSeasoning Mix.\"  The only cheese I had on hand was sharp cheddar. Used lean  ground beef.   My loaf pan is 9x5in, so I cook it 45 minutes and it was thoroughly cooked and still moist. I used no -salt added Tomato sauce.  We will be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe, Kiran.",
