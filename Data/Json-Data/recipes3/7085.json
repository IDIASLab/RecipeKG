However, the sodium content is alarming: over 1,100 miligrams per serving!!! Not cool! So I altered the cooking method to bring out more flavor sans sodium. I used frozen turnips with greens & added celery. I sauted onion, celery, carrots, and a bay leaf in a tsp of oil. Then added the other veggies and about 3 Tbls of roughly chopped garlic. Sauted a about 10 min. Then added 12 cups of water and 4 Tbls of Better than Boullion (which brought the sodium to over 2,400 miligrams for the whole pot, or 240 per serving). I cooked the barley on the side to save time and skipped the flour/butter to save calories and because I prefer a brothy soup. Hearty, filling, and, with a few modifications, healthy!",

So...just an FYI. If you want to try a little perhaps you would want to quarter it. It's not bad actually and certainly full of veggies which is what we're going for right now. But I have to say that I don't really like brussel sprouts and this soup isn't going to change my mind about that. Happily they are easy to pick out if you decide you don't like them but have someone else in the house who does like them (bf) and they don't make the soup taste like cabbage or anything (I don't like cabbage so that would be a downer for me). I made this in the crock pot and it was done after 4 hours on high which is exciting bc you could probably let this cook on low while you are at work all day. (Well that's exciting to me anyway). It didn't really thicken up much with the crockpot though so keep that in mind if you like thick soups--if you do you are better off sticking to the recipe. All in all a nice fall/winter soup chock full of veggies and easily adjusted to taste. Thanks for the recipe!",
