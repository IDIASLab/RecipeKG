Don't be too exact with your spices though, just flavor as you go to your own tastes--personally, I never measure mine out.  These pizzas are great to put in the fridge overnight and grab as a quick lunch the next day with a dollop of plain yogurt on top!",

The first night I made it using homemade pizza dough; I don't recommend this b/c by the time the crust was done cooking (on a baking stone no less) the topping was too dried out. I wasn't very happy! Thankfully I had leftover topping so the next day I made it on shop bought pitta bread. I also spread the topping on a bit more generously. The result was tasty and fabulous! Recommended. Note that I did not use fenugreek feta or lime. I did add more chopped fresh mint and actually added it to the topping while cooking.",

We bought fresh made plain and garlic nann and used those in place of pita bread. It crisped well during cooking and was really tasty! My feta cheese did not melt during cooking. If I make this again I would take the cheese out of the fridge earlier and let it warm up some. Don't be afraid to be liberal with the lime juice - it really adds a nice kick at the end.",
