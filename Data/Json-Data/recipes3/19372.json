Freeze them for about an hour or overnight before you dip them and take them out ONLY when you're ready to do it!  This will produce a much cleaner, prettier patty.  I've never used this recipe here, but I have my own personal recipe I use that turns out every time.  Use white almond bark and a rasberry flavoring for Valentine's Day or as a nice color ensemble with the chocolate/mint patties in a holiday basket!  And I gave this 5 stars because of the people that followed the recipe as directed, it turned out great for them.  I don't believe in giving someone a bad review just because I messed it up.",

I didn't have any wax paper so I used an oven liner (new of course)--worked GREAT. When they filled the oven liner I used half of my cutting board--Bad idea-they stuck and I had to chissel them off. I didn't have time to let them sit overnight becaue I made them the day before Christmas Eve so I put them in the freezer like another reviewer suggested--worked out perfect--HUGE time saver. I used a lot more sugar than the recipe called for and I added a few drops of green food coloring for Christmas. Gave some out with cookies in Christmas themed tins. My daughter (5) helped make the patties and we had a ball! Will definatly be making again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.",

I froze them before dipping them in the chocolate. Knowing my family I will be making these every year at Christmas. I also did some using raspberry flavoring and a little red food coloring.
