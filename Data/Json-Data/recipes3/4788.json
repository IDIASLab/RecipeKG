Of course I ran to allrecipes and found this recipe.  I made this with penne and since the market was closed in the middle of the night, I didn't have access to fresh basil, so I  used dried.  We had this with the left over flat beer from Hooters and after the two imbecile's passed out on my futon, I let the air out of their tires.  That'll teach them to wake me up for spaghetti!!  Enjoyed this very much, thanks for sharing.",

I used dried basil and it was way too much.  I doctored it up by doubling the garlic and parmesean.  I added two whole chicken breasts and that saved it.  It turned out okay despite too much dried basil.  I will make this again with fresh basil in the future!  Peace and blessings, people.",

I       prefer to saute my garlic briefly in the EVOO first, add just a a pinch of   red pepper flakes, add no salt (but use salted butter) and I do prefer to use Locatelli or Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan, as the flavor is a tad sharper and just lends itself perfectly to this particular  combination.

The entire family enjoyed this, even my uber-picky 7-year-old daughter. I served the pasta on a plate as a \"bed\" for chicken breast seared in garlic lemon butter, and my husband said it looked like something they would make on Food Network. LOL!",
