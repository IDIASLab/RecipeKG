I think it would be better if you rubbed a little oil on the skin before the baking so the skin would crisp up a little or do this on the grill or use skinless meat -- as written the skin stays kind of squishy which we found unappealing personally. Any jam would probably work -- I used orange marmalade and served this with AR's \"Sweet and Spicy Green Beans\". Thanks for the recipe!",
