The last time I made these I bought 1 container of cool whip and only 1 box of lemon cake mix but when getting home found out I needed more cookies. So I used half of the carton of cool whip which is a cup and half and they stilled turned out wonderful. They weren't as runny and I didn't have to freeze or cool the batter to make it usable.(they were still sticky) Luckily I had a chocolate cake mix on hand to make a 2nd batch with the other half of the container of cool whip.....and they went over with rave reviews. This year for Christmas I'm making them with spice cake mix and another batch with red velvet cake mix to take to a cookie exchange. My children love the spice ones better then the lemon!",

While building our dream home in '05 I made these SEVERAL TIMES for the contractors building our home and out of all the baked items I fed them these were their favorites. Still to this day when these same guys come back to provide maintenance etc. they always mention my awesome lemon cookies. So here's the key to these \"pain in the kiester to make\" cookies: Always use Duncan Hines Supreme Lemon Cake Mix. I've never refrigerated the dough. I've never used my hands to touch the dough to form balls. I use 2 spoons to form the balls (takes 2 seconds per ball) then transfer the balls (via spoon) to a large bowl containing the powdered sugar. After throwing in about 12 dough balls (remember large bowl) I take 2 more spoons (designated for just this process) and toss them lightly in the powdered sugar. Then spoon them onto parchment paper lined cookie sheets (I ONLY USE AIR-BAKE! For EVERY kind of cookie I make.) and pop them in the oven. Works like a charm!",
