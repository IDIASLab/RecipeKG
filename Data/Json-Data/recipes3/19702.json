I used the chuck roast and seasoned it w/ salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a little italian seasoning.  Make sure you sear the meat well, but not burned.  After searing, I put the onions in the pot with a diced bell pepper, a few cut up baby carrots, a can of sliced mushrooms, a dash of Worcestershire, and half a can of beef broth.  I let it come to a boil, then put the roast back in the pot and put it in the oven.  Last thing was to thicken the liquid with a little flour.  This pot roast tasted so homemade, my husband and daughter cleaned up for me!  Make sure that you add some type off liquid (broth, wine, water, or combination), otherwise yours will be very dry.  Hope this helps, I now have a pot roast recipe!!!",

This recipe makes a beautiful presentation and the juices and onion and garlic makes it's own gravy/sauce.  The key to it not coming out dry (as one reviewer complained) is searing the meat for the full 4 minutes on each side.  I set the kitchen timer and left it alone.  Also do not add salt (just like the recipe states) until the meat is seared.  This keeps the juices from running.  I was also able to use a less expensive piece of meat and it turned out fabulously!",

Meanwhile, on the bottom of my Dutch Oven I put carrots, celery, 4 cloves of garlic, onion wedges,and quartered potatoes. I made a rub of lemon pepper, garlic salt, pepper and paprika. After searing, using disposable gloves, I rubbed the seasonings on all sides of the roast. I also stuck 5 cloves of garlic in slits in the roast. I added 1/2 can of beef broth over the vegies.  Covered tightly with heavy alum. foil and cooked following the recipe. Wonderful! ",

                "reviewBody": "I picked this recipe because I wanted a plain pot roast without added vegetables, wine, beef broth etc. -- a recipe that allows one to savor the flavor of the beef. This is it! Followed the recipe as given, although my chuck roast was only 3 lbs. The roast came out very juicy and tender with a delicious flavor. There was a lot of juice in the pan, but it's a stretch to call it 'gravy'. You'll have to thicken and season it to get a traditional brown gravy but there's plenty of juice to work with. For those who have problems, two suggestions: 1) chuck roast is one of the cheapest beef roast cuts and I've only been satisfied when purchased at a good butcher shop. The one's found in the grocery store usually cook up pretty tough and/or dry. I've also had good luck with chuck roasts from Whole Foods. 2) Make sure your roaster/dutch oven has a tight fitting lid AND is sized for the roast. If the lid is loose or you use a roaster that holds a 25 lb turkey, the pot roast will turn out dry. Great and easy recipe.",

I seared the meat as directed and added 2 cups of beef broth (I use the powdered bouillon, so I used 2 packets to make the 2 cups of broth) and put it in the oven for the first 30 minutes. When I turned down the temp, I added the seasoning and veggies. I used 1 onion, about 2 teaspoons chopped garlic, 1 green bell pepper, 1 whole bunch of celery, baby carrots, red potatoes and 1 packet Onion Mushroom Soup Mix. I seasoned the meat with pepper, Tony Chachere's Seasoning, Worchestershire and a shaking of red pepper flakes.  I didn't use the bay leaves.  I just covered the Dutch Oven with foil and let it go for the next 1 1/2 hour.  It was FABULOUS!!!  I can't wait to eat it tomorrow!",

After cutting and slicing the meat only tasted good for about the first 2 minutes. Then it quickly became dry and chewy without it sitting in the gravy/roast pot. I also thought it lacked flavor. I added lots of onions and garlic at the bottom to compensate for bigger roast compared to recipe.",
