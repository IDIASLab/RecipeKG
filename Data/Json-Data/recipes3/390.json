I think some of you didn't understand the directions is all. If you add the dry cake mix only to the pudding with the 2 eggs and chocolate chips it comes out perfect. I think people were mixing the cake mix as usual then adding the pudding etc that is where your problem could have been. I say try it again! If you follow the directions exactly as written you shouldn't have a muddy mess.",

If you try it and have problems you're not imagining it. Either ingredients are missing or directions are not specific enough because as-written the end-result will be a cake pan full of hot liquidy goo. If you cook it 15-20 minutes longer it eventually becomes semi-solid and edible but caves in drastically as soon as it's removed from the oven and has a very odd texture. If you continue cooking it expecting it to become a solid cake-like object you will be left with nothing but a burned gooey mess. It's very strange! I recommend either \"Too Much Chocolate Cake\" submitted by Denise or \"Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake\" submitted by Caitlin Koch instead of this flawed recipe. They're the same concept mostly the same ingredients but result in a far better cake.",

I didn't think of it until after it was in the oven but when you make 2 boxes of pudding via box instructions - that is 4 cups of milk!!! Way too much liquid for a cake. I believe that perhaps whoever submitted this recipe made a typo & it's supposed to be only 1 box of pudding. I do not want to waste time & money finding out if that way will work though. SERIOUSLY - do NOT make this if you want a cake. Only make if you're looking for some semi decent tasting chocolate mush. Now I have to go out and try something else quick for the party later today.

I even had a back up cake mix just in case but I didn't need to use it. I even made the mistake of getting instant pudding since I missed the key word of NONinstant. I mixed the pudding together as according to the directions and then let it set for 5 minutes to set up and thicken then went ahead with the recipe. It worked perfectly. Now this is not very cakey but kind of like a very dense moist brownie. I made a chocolate whipped cream frosting using Dream Whip because I wanted something light for the cake since I needed to frost it. I will make this again. Don't be afraid of this recipe just make sure you make the pudding right and you shouldn't have any problems:)",

It was well risen and lovely when taken out of the oven but a few minutes later had compressed (not fallen as it was the whole cake not just the center) to half it's original size. The taste was mediocre--not great not horrible. The texture was downright strange---my husband said it was like chocolate tofu---it was very much like some kind of semi-solid pudding and not very much like cake. I would not make this recipe again and I'll be surprised if it all gets eaten although 12 year old grand-daughter thought it was all right.",
