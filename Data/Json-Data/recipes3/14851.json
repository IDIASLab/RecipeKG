Against my better judgment and knowing that there was sugar in the marinade that easily burns, I went with the directions anyway. After 90 seconds on the first side, the fish was turning black. I decided to forgo keeping the heat on high for the second side. Instead, I lowered the heat to medium, flipped the fish and only cooked that side for 45 seconds before having to remove it from the pan. The burnt residue in the pan from the first side, along with the residual high heat was starting to burn the second side. For the record, my filets were about 1\u201d thick. This needs to be cooked between medium and medium high, tops.  The dipping sauce was a nice idea, however I felt it could have used more salt to balance the flavors. It did cover up the burnt flavor though. I ended up drizzling the marinade over my veggies and that was quite good.",
