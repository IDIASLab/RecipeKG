I prepared this in more of a stir fry fashion, using beef tenderloin that I cut into strips and marinaded in the fajita seasoning and a little vegetable oil. I sauteed the peppers and onions first, using a pretty and colorful blend of green, red, orange and yellow.  I then stir fried the beef tenderloin strips, deglazed the pan with a little water,and added the pepper mixture back in. At the last I added some chopped, fresh cilantro (sure loved that contribution of flavor!) and skipped the lime juice. I served this over a bed of rice. This was quick, easy and delicious--I had dinner on the table in about 20 minutes.  I confess I don't think I would have liked this prepared as directed--it would have taken much longer, and I don't care for the idea of cooking a rib eye steak for 30 minutes to an hour.  Stew meat, maybe--ribeye, not. Prepare this quickly by sauteeing a good cut of meat and there's no way you could be disappointed.  ",
