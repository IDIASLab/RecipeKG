I also used roasted garlic instead of fresh and will definitely make this dish again. Update - and again and again - this is a go-to in my house now I just love it. But I have to give a warning about chipotles in adobo - they seem to have been getting hotter and hotter with each can it seems. So make sure to start slowly adding more as necessary to bring the potatoes up to your preferred heat level. And while I don't seed my chipotles you might if you are more spice-sensitive.",

I don't eat potatoes often (perhaps because growing up it was always \"meat n potatoes\" and still today Sunday dinners with the family include them) but decided to buy some cute baby reds from the farmers market. I like the skins so I didn't peel them or cube just boiled. I skipped the garlic since I didn't think I'd like it in this raw and didn't feel like cooking it. Added a shredded cheese blend and milk...skipped the mayo and cilantro. Loved the flavor and textural components: smoky and just spicy enough creamy with the right amount of chunky texture cheesy and flavorful. Bacon would certainly be a great addition maybe with some sliced scallion and it would be reminscent of a loaded baked potato. Yum!",
