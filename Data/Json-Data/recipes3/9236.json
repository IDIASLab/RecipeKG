Instead of celery seed (which I did not have) I used Beau Monde seasoning (not the all purpose Beau Monde the kind that is basically onion powder and celery salt) I used all chopped red pepper and Steam Fresh frozen whole green beans. Terrible name or not my whole family loved this soup.......even the picky youngest child. I have to admit I was sketchy about using jarred three bean salad but it totally works. Great flavors awesome combination of ingredients! I paired this with homemade Skillet Rolls and it was a very comforting and filling meal.",
