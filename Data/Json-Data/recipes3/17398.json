While working at our small snack bar we were looking for something QUIK-N-TASTY we could make with the plain old hawt dawgs we already had. Of course we came across your recipe and forever changed our snack bar lives. HINT-- the snack bar only has swiss american cheese so we invented a NEW SPICY-N-DICY hawg-n-dog variation... Dice jalapeno peppers and put them in between two slices of cheese within the hawt dawgs. MMMMMM.... GOOD-N-SPICY! Also we thought it would be cute as a button if the name were HAWG-N-DAWGS with the \"d-a-w-g.\" -Sally Jessy & Mary Tyler",
