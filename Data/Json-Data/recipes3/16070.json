I couldn't find Haloumi at my local market so I used Bread Cheese, which has a similar consistency and heats just as well on the grill.\n\nThis salad has gorgeous colors with the green spinach, purple onions, red peppers and the red-orange of the nectarine. The dressing is light and tasty. If your nectarines are very soft and juicy, you could reduce the honey by half, this salad was plenty sweet.\n\nI did not add the almonds- didn't have any. I didn't miss the crunch since the peppers and onions added some of that texture. Serve with a grilled pork tenderloin or poultry for a wonderful early summer meal.",
