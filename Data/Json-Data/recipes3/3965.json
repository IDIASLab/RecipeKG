I used very firm gr. tomatoes - I would recommend using some that have a little \"give\" to them.  I found that the batter was really enough to cover about 2 tomatoes.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil in the frying pan.  I cut the salt in 1/2 and it definitely needed more - I would use the entire amt.  Also, I sprinkled the tomatoes with Pecorino cheese after frying and served with spaghetti sauce.  My husband and I loved it, the kids weren't too crazy about it.  Great recipe, Beth!",

I bought 2 green tomatoes about a week ago and one stayed green and the other got red but stayed firm. I used these 2 tomatoes to make this and they were both fantastic. I used Ritz instead of saltines just because I happened to have a sleeve at home. And I also cooked them in a mixture of butter and oil. I fried mine at the next notch above medium and it was a perfect tempurature. These were delicious and I will be using this recipe again. You could even make this to make winter tomatoes taste good!
