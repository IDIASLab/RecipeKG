Once they were brown, I removed them & sauteed the onion & mushrooms.  While those were cooking I whisked about a half cup of dry white wine & a half cup of milk in with the mushroom soup and added a tablespoon of fresh tarragon & some fresh ground pepper.  I returned the chops to the pan & poured the sauce over them.  I covered them & simmered for about 30 minutes.  There was pleanty of yummy mushroom sauce to pour over the chops & the rice.  This would be good with potatoes, too.  This is a recipe that when served looks like it took hours to make, but is really very easy.",

I sauteed onions w/ fresh garlic & then added them to the chops.  I increased the soup to 2 cans & added white wine & milk (I really felt that gave it more flavor, thank you to the reviewer who recommended that!) I poured it over & also added fresh mushrooms (I didn't saute them simply because my husband brought them home with him).  They turned out really well...I simmered it for a good 30-40 minutes.  I made mashed potatoes with it, and used the leftover mushrooms and onion to saute with some green beans and garlic.  The only thing I may try next time is a marinade before browning the chops to give them even more flavor.  I gave it a 5 because it's a wonderful base recipe that can be tweaked to your liking, I'm not sure if I would have liked it as much without the changes, though. Great meal idea, super easy and adaptable, thank you! :)",

However through the years I have tweaked it to my families liking and have found my families favorite way.  I brown the chops as stated here with a simple salt and pepper start.  After browning the meat, I remove it and place in a casserole pan.  I add the onions (lightly salt and pepper them too) into the fry pan with the meat's leftover grease and cook until they are translucent, add the mushrooms and cook another 6-8 minutes or so, I then add 2 cloves minced garlic and continue to cook about 30-45 seconds.  I then remove all of the veggies from the pan and put on top of the chops. Then deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup white wine.  Be sure to scrape all the bits of brown from the bottom of the pan.  I then add the can of mushroom soup and add the milk -cream- or half&half, whatever you have, and mix with a whisk until reheated again.  I then add some ground or fresh rosemary and thyme to the sauce and mix well again, then pour over the veggies and meat.  I sprinkle with a bit of Paprika, cover with foil and place in a 350 oven for about 1/2 hour.  I then remove the foil and cook another 15 min, remove from oven and serve with some creamy mashed potatoes.  YUMMMMM-O!  So tender and good you'll wish you made double!",
