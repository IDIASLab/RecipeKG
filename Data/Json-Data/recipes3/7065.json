We made small loaves (about the size of a large hoagie roll) and let them rise for about 1/2 hour. Then we placed them in boing water (covered pot) and did not lift the cover for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes we turned the dumplings over and cooked for another 10 minutes. When you lift them out cut with fishing line. These turn out like steamed bread. Lighter than dumplings. We always served them with gravy. They were always the hit of every holiday meal!",
