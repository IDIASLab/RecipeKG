She would use old clean sheets specifically saved for this purpose and roll out countless phyllo snakes full of tasty feta/egg mixtures.  I remember 3-4 large sized pans baked on Saturday mornings.  And the crispy flaky texture was amazing.  Puts the store bought stuff to shame and I could never understand why anyone would use store bought.  This is more versatile.",

I had no trouble with it except to say that I added an additional teaspoon of white vinegar even after tripling the normal amt to help let it stretch.

I don t know how Phyllo dough must be all I can say this recipe makes very good dough. 5 stars Update Finally I found Phyllo and I have to change the rewiew. I realized this is not a phyllo dough substitution. It is imposible to roll and stretch the dough so thin as phyllo is so you will get the wrong dough and texture in final dish. When you bake with phyllo you put a few layers together. It is imposible to do with this dough. Even if you are able to stretch this dough very thin without tearing the layers will stick together so you will get almost one layer after baking. The texture wasn t flaky at all. I realized this recipe can't be used for Baklava and other Arabic sweets or Greek recipes with Phyllo. I tried this dough for other recipes without success too.",
