Pre-baking the flattened buscuits with the egg wash and seasoning was key for us. Then we just added whatever toppings each person wanted and it was great. My daughter selected BBQ sauce instead of the traditional marinara - and it was tasty. We skipped the more exotic ingredients (feta pepper flakes) and stuck with combinations of sausage cheese and sauce. This was sooooo quick and easy! Thanks for the idea!",

My five year old and I just used it to make mini cheese pizzas. (So base my rating on the concept of this recipe more than the actual ingredient list.) It was great and he really enjoyed making them. I took the advice of another poster and prebaked the crust part for five minutes. I did sprinkle the dough with garlic and italian seasonings prior to baking. I then baked for five minutes. Then added the sauce and cheese and toppings and baked for about ten minutes. Fun Tasty and easy!!!!!",
