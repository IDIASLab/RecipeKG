I had 2 hot Italian sausage so I stripped them out of their skin to make \"meatballs\". Sauteed them in garlic flavored olive oil with 2/5 of a huge onion. Snipped up some roasted dried bullnose peppers. \"hey Google what's 10% of 5oz in grams?\" About 14 grams of dried King Bolete mushrooms from Finland went next along with a can of petite diced tomatoes in juice and a little extra water because the veggies were dried. I added the basil and salt as directed. I only had 1 box wine in my house so? c Moscato went in. When these had simmered a bit I added 1# seafood medley from Costco. I covered it and cooked it just long enough to thaw and cook the frozen seafood. Three of us had a bowl and there is enough leftover for at least 2 more bowls. Spectacular!",
