I used a mandoline to slice the potatoes really thin and sliced the Polish kielbasa into bite sized pieces instead of leaving in lengths. I started by layering some of the potatoes followed by kielbasa then cheese then layered again with potatoes and so on. Finished off with milk and seasonings, so I guess I did it lagsana style and it still worked out. Kids loved it and all hubby could say was mmmm the whole time he was eating. This is a keeper. ",

As long as you follow the directions it comes out perfect.  I use Hillshire Farms Lite Keilbasa and a mandolin to slice my potatoes and it comes out very well.  I have made it with a combo of sweet potatoes and baking potatoes and that is also fabulous.  Since it is requested so much at home I try to be more health conscious and I use all sweet potato and it is great!  Thanks for the excellent easy recipe!!!",
