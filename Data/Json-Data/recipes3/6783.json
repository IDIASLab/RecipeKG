I chose not to use potatoes as I was already serving rice with my meal. I drizzled on just enough oil to coat the veggies before roasting. I used white balsamic vinegar but only used a small amount. Even that amount threatened to overpower the vegetables. I halved this recipe AND skipped the potatoes and this still made a good bit - more than two servings. Because I was roasting a chicken I needed to roast these veggies at 350 F. After one hour mine were done perfectly at that temperature.",

I used just enough oil to coat, then before serving drizzled just a touch more and sprinkled with sea salt & a squeeze of lemon instead of the balsamic vinegar.  This was a great way to clean out that veggie drawer!  Even with only 1 potato my veggies served 4 with plenty leftover for tomorrow's lunch.  Yum. (oh, baked at 400 for 45 minutes)",
