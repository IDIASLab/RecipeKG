I absolutely loved the crust made of sugar cookie dough... Yummo! The filling was rich and creamy and oh so good! Even better the next day after I let it set overnight to get that thick creamy texture I like. I have made it twice and will make again!!!",

I loved the lemon lime flavor. It almost reminded me of key lime pie. I also couldn't find fat-free condensed milk, so I used regular condensed milk. These bars were a huge hit with my family and friends. They were gone in a day. Will definitely make again!",
