Some people were wondering why I called it spicy, my recipe was edited by the owners of this web site and they put corn chips down instead of spicy Fritos.  You can also use chili cheese Fritos in this recipe if you can't find the hot and spicy Fritos.  Another option is to get black beans with jalepeno peppers added, it gives the salad an extra kick.  Also, make sure to add the Fritos last, since they will get soggy if they sit in the salad too long  -Taseia",
