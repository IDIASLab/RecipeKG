I've been cooking for about seven years so I don't think it's me; 5 cups of sugar for 4 cups of frosting is just excessive. My advice? Use 2-3 cups sugar and add less liquid ingredients. Taste and then decide if you want more sweetness. Really though I had to throw out the whole batch and I used really good quality cocoa.",

I made it to go along with the Black Magic Cake (also on allrecipes), and I found it to be a little shy on the coffee side, so I added quite a bit which then prompted me to thicken it with more of the other ingredients.  Overall, a very good frosting recipe that has the mixture of the bitterness of coffee (I used leftover espresso instead of granules) and the sweetness of chocolate.  Very rich and satisfying.

Also if you're into presentation the color is a little light because it's mostly sugar so it doesn't look as stunning as a really chocolatey frosting would. It's definitely more a children's frosting than an adult one. I only made half the recipe and I added a little extra milk because mine came out a little too thick but otherwise followed it exactly. I would make it again but I might tweak it to add more chocolatey-coffee flavor.",
