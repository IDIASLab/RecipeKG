The flavor of this beef lands somewhere between grilled and smoked, and I've got a great garlicky, acidic pepper sauce to go with it. Try this recipe with a more expensive cut of meat plus any sauce of choice, from chimichurri to barbeque. You can't go wrong!",

                "reviewBody": "Hello Chef,\nSearching the net some years ago I came across a \"new\" recipe for grilling Steak.  \nYep....just like what you're doing.  Other names were Eisenhour Steak, Dirty Steak, Caveman Steak and so on.   (The \"Tomahawk Steak \"  is an impressive beast but you'll need to know the butcher. See the video on line). \nTheir recipes called for either Rib Eyes or Strips.  And they really do cook up quite nicely .    Just a few thoughts:  \n\nRemind the readers NOT to use any oil, my idiot brother, a retired meat salesman, thought it was a necessity and he not only ruined his steaks, he  near had the local Fire Dept over for dinner!  \n\nUse a chimney starter, no fluids!!!\nBe sure the meat is patted dry and it cooks best when at room temp.  \nThey said to season with salt just before grilling but no pepper or other dry herbs/spices as some say it burns.  \nI do believe a 2\" cut is the most impressive and the  recipes call for a quick 4 to 6 minute sear on each side and then tented in a 250 degree oven for a 15 minute or so rest.  If in doubt use a thermometer.  \n\nAs you always say.......Enjoy!",
