It's great that you can make the mix for these ahead of time and then just take it out when you've run into a PMS emergency. I like mine with chocolate syrup and a small scoop of ice cream. TIP: If you don't like the eggy taste use a couple tablespoons of applesauce. You'll still get the same end result but without the eggy taste. With chocolate cake mix do one tablespoon applesauce and one tablespoon creamy peanut butter. That's the great thing about this recipe the ingredients are flexible. This is just a base recipe.

Anyway the first time I used a whole egg to make one mugful of cake and I agree that it was too eggy. The second time I tried an egg white it was still a bit eggy but better. The third time I used powdered egg whites which turned out quite good. I wanted to add this because some people were saying their kids made this....you could probably mix powdered egg whites in the mix originally before seperating it into bags-then you would only need to add water and oil! (wohoo no salmonella!)I read someone else was using plain soy milk instead of eggs I will be trying that next. I also was adding canned peaches or canned fruit (light) and the juice from them cutting the cake into little pieces and pouring the fruit over them so the juice soaks into the cake evenly. It was quite tasty. Also works well using one serving of those plastic single serve fruit-in-a-cup things.",
