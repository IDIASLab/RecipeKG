Since I wanted a chunky soup, I went about this a little differently.  I started by pulsing my tomatoes in the food processor until I achieved the texture I was after and poured them into a bowl.  I did the same with the bell peppers (I used red, green and yellow) and onions and poured them in the bowl.  Then again with the cucumbers.  This allowed me to control the texture of all the vegetables.  Finally, again in the food processor, I pulsed the bouillon, fresh oregano, fresh basil, seasonings, Worcestershire and red wine vinegar, along with about 1/2 cup of the tomato juice (I used V-8), then adding it to the bowl with the other processed veggies.  I then added the remaining V-8 to the bowl to get the consistency I was looking for and ended up using it all.  We enjoyed this the following evening with a sandwich for a delicious, easy meal.  Thanks Lucky!",

I used V8 juice instead of tomato juice because it's what I had on hand and served with a dollop of plain yogurt.  The only thing that I will do differently in the future is pulse separately the tomatoes and the cukes to have a little chunkier texture.  If you're a gazpacho fan, give this a try.  Great for summer or any time of the year.  This one is a keeper.",

I used vine ripe tomatoes and a bit more cucumber didn't know what to do with the other half. I used my food processor to puree everything together. V-8 was my juice which I added until it reached the consistency I liked since I like my soup to be on the thicker side. Most gazpachos taste like you are eating a bowl of salsa without spice however the added beef bouillon and Worcestershire sauce give sharper flavors that linger on the palate more like a winter soup would. I did cut the beef bouillon down to one tsp. to reduce some of the sodium since I have to watch that. I used fresh spices from the garden also. Gazpacho is best if you give it at least 4 hours for the flavors to marinate. Thanks Lucky great summer soup.",
