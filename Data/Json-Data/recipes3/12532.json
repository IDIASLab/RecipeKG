I don't usually leave reviews but saw that this recipe only had three reviews and I wanted to do my bit to boost it because, in my opinion, it deserves it.  I made it exactly as is and felt that the flavors worked well together - I never would have thought to include cashews in a potato stew but their smooth richness contrasted well with the spicy tang of the tomatoes.  I would definitely make again and the only thing I would do differently would be to exclude the ranch dressing and hot sauce toppings - I  felt the dish stood on its own and didn't need them.",

I prefer real tomato's instead of canned (tasting can in your food is off putting so use 3 med sized tomatoes on the vine or you can measure 16 ounces of real chopped tomatoes & besides who needs calcium chloride in their diet anyhow so ditch the canned tomatoes) I halved the cashews, doubled the spinach & added some of my own chipotle in adobo to give it some smoky spice (hot sauce is boring imo & yes I used the red pepper flakes as well bc I prefer hot hot hot). I tossed the ranch & cheddar (I don't do dairy) With regards to the ranch, only bc I care about real nutrition that serves a purpose, is that your typical store bought ranch has some pretty harmful toxic chems in it so try making your own or buy a really good organic brand in a glass bottle. Jason's recipe is a simple foundation to build upon. If you make it the way I suggest  & leave out the butter, ranch & cheese it a very nice hearty vegan dish when using organic ingredients.",
