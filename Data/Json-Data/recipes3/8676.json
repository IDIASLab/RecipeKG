Hard boiled eggs would be a good addition as would celery.   ***Make sure the water the potatoes are cooked in is salted***   I used frozen peas that were just gently warmed as we don't care for canned peas.   Overall, this was well received and with a few tweaks is a nice recipe.   Thanks!",

Canned peas only! Instead of ham bologna can be used, but cooked chicken breast is the best! Plus no Ranch, please. Mayo is the right dressing :) This salad roots from the Soviet past, what Ranch are you talking about? :) To sum up:\n- canned peas,\n- hard boiled eggs,\n- mayonnaise,\n- cooked chicken breast.\nThe rest is fine.",
