I did everything exactly the same in this recipe but instead of four large potatoes I used 12 very small potatoes. Everyone including my very picky sister enjoyed the potatoes. I had purchased a huge bag of potatoes and still had ingredients left so I came home and made a second batch. I m single so I froze those potatoes separately and stored them for future meals. Last night I took one out and baked it to go with my meal and it was just as good as those I baked right away. One thing I don t like about twice baked potatoes if they leave a lot of the baked potato around the edges. I made a point of scraping out as much potato as I could so that I would have a nice soft goodness through the whole potato. Thanks for the recipe!",
