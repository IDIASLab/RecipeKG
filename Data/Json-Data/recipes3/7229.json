The only thing I did differently was to salt the actual oxtail pieces rather than mix the salt in with the flour and garlic/onion powder.  Also, I didn't have onion powder so I just used double garlic powder and it was still awesome.  This is definitely going to be my go-to meal if I need to impress someone!  Cook it the full time...I did only 2.5 hours and it was not fall-off-the-bone which meant it was harder to eat.",

But, instead of thyme it called for oregano, I also used celery salt instead of celery root/stalk ,1 bottle of red wine , 1 cup of broth, no flour . But I suppose that is to thicken the fluid. It also called to season the oxtail with allspice , salt , and pepper over night or at least 2 hours marinating . Seared the oxtails before putting it in the liquid mixture. Placed everything in a Dutch oven & covered . My oxtails were cut so thick so I cooked it for 2 1/2 hours on 325 in the oven. Tastes heavenly. This is how I'm going to make it all the time .",

Then I found this recipe...It reminded me of a recipe for Beef Bourguignon that I love.  It is every bit as rich as that...but with a little more subtle overall flavor.  \n\nI will make one change next time and that would be to soak the oxtail in the red wine overnight...that will help breakdown the toughness even more than just slow cooking alone.  The only other change I made was I added more garlic powder...it was actually an accident...but one I liked.  I served it over an al dente' fettuccine which was a perfect match for the sauce.  Speaking of sauce...OMG!  Yet another reminder that if you cook full flavored, rich food, you don't need typical American type portions.  A much smaller portion was very satisfying.  The only problem I had was that I got impatient and didn't  reduce the wine enough in the first part of the recipe, which left me with too much liquid at the end so I had to reduce that more to make up for it.  That's my own fault and a reminder to all to take your time and don't rush this one.  You'll be glad you didn't because the final outcome is perfect if you follow this recipe.",
