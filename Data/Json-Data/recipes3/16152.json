Everyone declared it their favorite as well as very dangerous; it was so smooth and fruity with just the right amount of tang vs. sweet. I couldn't taste the alcohol which made it even more appealing to me.:) I used Simply Apple juice (it's really cider not juice) because I like its tangy earthy autumn flavor but I think any organic no-sugar-added apple cider would work. I think powdered cider/clear cider (it's supposed to be cloudy) /apple juice would be way too sweet. Also I floated the apple slice in the drink so that could eat infused apple afterward. I will definitely be making this drink quite often for the rest of the season. It's a lovely color the fragrance is gorgeous and it tastes wonderful. The only thing I'd change would be it's name; I'd call it something all fancy like Autumn Orchard Martini!:D",
