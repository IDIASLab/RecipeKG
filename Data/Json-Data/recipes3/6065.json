I used a regular smoked sausage instead of pepperoni (my boyfriend doesn't really care for pepperoni for some reason). The flavor is delicate yet powerful (paprika is one of my favorite spices). Great winter comfort food and I will make it again. It is on the same page as a keilbasa and cabbage recipe I made from this site a few weeks back. I would enjoy adding cabbage to this dish. I guess as a Czech you can't go wrong with sausage and vegetables!",

I served it over rice with a side of cheese garlic biscuits and a glass of California Rose. Great dinner! My husband who is a big lover of any sort of processed meat raved about this dish.",
