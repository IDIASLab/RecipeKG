These cookies are easy to make and wonderfully delicious. They are just a bit time consuming. I used foil covered round colthesd pins that I rubbed a little shortening on. Cut the strips with a pizza cutter to make things go quicker. Make sure you mix the cottage cheese and the sugar/butter for a good bit to blend everything and break up the cheese curds. This will help with the 'cottage cheese after taste'. When cooking the flour and milk to a paste make sure it is VERY THICK and refrigeratre it for several hours or else the filling will be too runny. Depending on the humidity and the thickness of the paste you may need to add more powdered sugar to make a stiffer filling.",

I creamed together the fat and cottage cheese in a food processor for approx 5 minutes until glossy smooth.  I needed more flour than 4 cups (four and a half to five, but add gradually) beacuse the dough was very sticky to start with.   The flavor of the cooked cookie shell was superb, but it has a different texture than puff pastry... it was more like a Pillsbury crescent roll. It was not flaky , but it was tender.  I can see this dough recipe used for a variety of things (appetizers, tarts, etc) and will definietly keep in my recipe book.",

It's forgiving if you rip it just pinch it back together and re-roll. Make sure you start with small curd cottage cheese and beat it until there are absolutely no lumps and definitely don't skip the overnight refrigeration. I divided the dough into 8 pieces to make rolling out easier. Each divided portion gave me about 12 cookies. I didn't reroll the scraps but I think they would have been fine and come out to about 100 cookies. The end result was like puff pastry. As soon as I tasted it I could see a lot of applications for this dough piped with savory fillings. The filling recipe however I heavily tweaked. I thought it had a waxy artificial feel when I tried it alone perhaps from the shortening and fluff. I ended up adding a stick of softened butter and doubled the confectioners sugar (to a total of 4 cups) a pinch of salt and more real vanilla extract to even it out. Overall good recipe! Will make again. Excited to experiment with it.",
