After browning the bird I placed them in a 9x13 and then added 1 small onion to the butter that was left in the frying pan. I deglazed with about 1/2 cup of white wine and added salt and pepper. Then I added the cream and brought it to a boil before pouring it over the birds in the baking dish. I covered it with foil and backed it for 1 1/2 hours. The gravy was fantastic with the bird and delicious over mashed potatoes. We have lots of pheasant in our freezer so this will be made again and again!",

Bake them for 1 hour at 325 degrees in a covered casserole dish. It turned out pretty good! Moist and very flavorable. It was a tab bit dry but not to bad. At the end I added some brocolli.
