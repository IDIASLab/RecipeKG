The meds have made her tastebuds overly sensitive to salty tastes so I left out the added salt and used salt-free chicken broth. Another chemo complication is mouth sores so I also eliminated the cayenne and green chilis as well as the cilantro. Sounding pretty bland right? I made some less spicy substitutions using cumin in place of cayenne and fresh parsley instead of cilantro. Rather than cooking raw chicken I used a precooked rotisserie chicken for added savory flavors. The canned beans and rotisserie chicken seemed to provide plenty of salt already so I would not add additional salt anyway when I cook this in the future. In the end my variation was not as bland as I feared it might be. I did add a few shakes of hot sauce to my individual serving... delicious & nutritious!",
