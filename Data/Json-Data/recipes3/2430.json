An addition--I'm trying to be more healthy and tried this recipe again but with half ground turkey and baking on a cookie sheet instead of frying. I also substituted the fried onions for chopped fresh ones. Still good and I'm sure a lot less fat.",

The sauce was good but again sans jalapeno. Instead of making kabobs I just rolled out walnut sized meatballs which made it a little easier.
