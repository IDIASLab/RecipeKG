At first I was considering not adding the salt to season with the smoked turkey legs however I added it and I feel it was just the kick the stew needed. My family loved it. My son got seconds my husband took some to work for lunch. I only put in two peppers as I had a three year old to consider and she enjoyed it just fine. Next time I think instead of turkey I will use grilled chicken and shrimp as I don't want to get into the habit of serving a meat that is so salty.Once you puree everything it smells like a great salsa that you just want to chill and dip chips in however once you heat it up it takes on a different smell. Any meat probably could go with it. You don't need the entire one cup of oil. You could certainly get away with half a cup. Yummy dish!!! Will make this again. Thanks for posting this great recipe.",
