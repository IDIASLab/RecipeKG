The next time I pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave about half way first, but again, the chicken was a bit greasy and the bacon wasn't doing anything to compliment the chicken.  Now instead of bacon I wrap the chicken in prescutto and it's perfect!  The flavors mix very well with the feta and spinach stuffing.  It's now the first thing I cook for a guy when I want to impress him, and it works like a charm!  ",

After I butterflied the chicken breasts, I seasoned them with garlic powder and onion powder. Then, because I don't like chicken that does not have a golden color on the outside, I sauteed in a nonstick pan sprayed with Pam (because I am fat conscious due to cholesterol) for about 45 seconds per side til I got the color I wanted. (The center was still quite rare.)  I made my stuffing by using only half of a 10 oz carton of frozen spinach. (Drain the spinach well on lots of paper towels.) Then I added 3 parts fat free sour cream to 1 part mayo.  Per a previous reviewer I added 1 tsp of egg substitute to bind the mixture.  I also sauteed sweet Vidalia onions and fresh minced garlic to add to the spinach mixture.  Instead of feta cheese, I added grated Parmesan/Romano cheese (about 1/4 cup). After stuffing the chicken, I precooked slices of turkey bacon (less fat) and topped them on the chicken pieces.  I covered my chicken with aluminum foil to bake in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes (depends on thickness of your butterflied breasts). It was quite moist and very flavorful (not bland or dry.) And because I cut back on fat at every opportunity, it was healthy for our lifestyle.  Hope this helps those who have the same dietary concerns.",
