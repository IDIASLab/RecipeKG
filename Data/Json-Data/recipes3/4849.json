I agree with another reviewer who felt that it would take much longer than 30 min. to reduce 2 cups of chicken stock 1 cup of beef stock and 1 cup of marsala. I omitted 1 cup of stock and it still took over 30 min. to reduce it to a suitable thickness. The recipe calls for way too much flour for dredging the veal but fortunately you will need to add some of it to your scrapings in your pan in order to thicken this much liquid. Of course one could just reduce the sauce longer but the problem is that the veal is sitting in the oven the whole time and will be shockingly overdone by then. I would avoid reducing or omitting the butter from the sauce as this creats a great velvety texture.",

After 30 minutes it didn't look like it was going to thicken or reduce a whole lot so I added a little flour reduced to about 1 to 1 1/2 cups and I needed that much as we love sauce.
