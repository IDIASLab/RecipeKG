Then fry until golden brown.  I serve this with rice and beans or dip in Peruvian Green Aji sauce.  Yummy!",

This recipe works as is, IF you slice the yuca thin enough and skip the lime (it really doesn't \"go\"). I like to season it with garlic salt, OR drizzle with garlic infused olive oil OR serve with a side of  Mayo-Ketchup to dip in (1:1 ratio of mayo and ketchup with some pressed garlic in it or garlic powder). Having said that, I do prefer to cut the yuca in larger slices (like 1 in thick 3 to 4 inches long) and boil the yuca first, drain well, then fry. It just seems to work better and you get more of the yummy flavor of the yuca and its wonderful texture.",

Then I soak the sliced pieces in a cold water bath for one hour. I pour out the soak liquid and replenish the bowl of sliced yucca with more cold water and soak for another hour. This will allow your frites to fry up in the pan with a crispy exterior that surrounds an airy and flaky center. It helps de-starch the yucca which makes for a less heavy treat. A spritz of lime on the finished product is a must!",
