And I don't use allspice in my cacoila but as long as you have the wine paprika onion garlic salt and pepper it'll be good. Also you can just add a splash of orange juice instead of having to zest and juice oranges.",

The meat ended up marinating for an extra 24 hours as we unexpectedly went out for dinner when I should have been cooking this dish. We found the meat to be very flavorful; we can't understand why anyone would have called it bland. I served it with tortillas but would like to know what the Portuguese usually serve with it. I would caution anyone who makes this recipe to keep a close eye on the liquid levels. I gave the recipe only 4 stars because my stew beef while edible after an hour or so of cooking could have used another hour to get to the point of shredding. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks John for a recipe that we will keep making.",
