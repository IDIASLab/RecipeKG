I felt it did need a pretty healthy dose of both salt and pepper was cooked at 14 minutes so you may want to watch your time and I may even add in a bit of shredded carrot next time for a little pop of color. And don't skip the pine nuts they're important to this recipe. Very nice recipe thanks for sharing.",
