Be sure to chop the fennel and the onion; being lazy here makes the soup look rather sloppy (this happened to me). Also, this soup makes 17 cups, so the 6 servings is a generous estimate. \r\n(Per 1 cup, there are 125 calories, 2 g fat, 21 g carb, 6 g fiber and 6 g protien).",

To accommodate this change, I saut\u00e9ed the onions, red pepper and fennel for a few minutes in a little olive oil, then added 4 cups of veg broth and simmered for 15. I added the canned beans (juice and all) and the tomato/garlic/basil mixture and finished for 5 minutes. Not only does this work well, it takes far less time and planning!
