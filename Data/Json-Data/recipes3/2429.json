I was worried about timing the preparation of the meat along with the other sidedishes, so I prepared some of this ahead of time.  I roasted the shallots & boiled the wine/broth combination the day before and stored these in the refrigerator.  Then I cooked the bacon a couple of hours ahead of time, set it aside to cool and allowed the pan it cooked in to sit on the stovetop.  I took the suggestion of a couple of other posters and put the wine/broth mix, the bacon & shallots into the blender to make a smooth sauce.  This was really wonderful!  After roasting the tenderloin, I poured the smooth sauce into the same pan, whisked in the butter and flour and Voila! - an incredible tasting gravy to spoon over a moist & tender cut of meat.  I did roast the tenderloin longer because many of my guests like beef more well done.  Even with that, it still could be cut with a fork.  My husband and I can't wait to try this again with a more medium rare piece of meat.  I've tried many wonderful dishes from Allrecipes, but this one is the very best.",

                "reviewBody": "I served this for xmas dinner. I was very nervous because I've never served beef tenderloin. Everything turned out perfect. One guest called the next day and told me it was the best, most tender meat he and his wife ever had. I had a 4.5 pound tenderloin instead of the 2 pounds that the recipe called for but I did NOT double the amount of the sauce. I still had leftoever sauce. (the sauce was wonderful on the garlic mashed potatoes which I prepared the night before...I also made a broccoli casserole I found on this site and prepared the night before, too...just heated the side dishes 45 min. before serving time and they tasted great). I had six adults total and I had some leftovers of the tenderloin which is always better to have more than enough. One male guest must have had four slices of it...he raved about the meal. I made beef stew with the leftovers. I did take other suggestions and blended the shallots/bacon/sauce ahead of time. I fried the bacon earlier in the day and kept the grease in the pan and left the pan in my cooled garage for the day, and heated it up when I was ready to brown the tenderloin. Make sure you do some steps ahead so you're not spending all the time in the kitchen while your guests are there. All I can say is...if you really want to impress someone...make this meal! Just remember as many steps ahead as possible to save time! Expensive, but worth it for a special occasion!",

                "reviewBody": "I made this for Christmas dinner this year & it was great.  I bought a 5 lb. beef tenderloin from Costco, cut it in half & froze the 2nd half.  I was serving 6 people & 2-1/2 lbs. was plenty.  While I was roasting the shallots I also roasted 3 heads of garlic with the tops trimmed off, drizzled with olive oil & some salt.  The garlic needs about 15 minutes more than the shallots to get really tender. I roasted the meat as directed but it took my piece closer to 45 min. to reach the desired med. rare temp.  The sauce worked beautifully.  I used ruby port.  I added the chopped bacon back to the sauce but opted to serve the shallots and roasted garlic next to the sliced beef on a platter so the kids(who don't like shallots) could enjoy the sauce on the garlic mashed potatoes.  This was my first beef tenderloin and it was as so tender you could cut it with a butter knife & extremely flavorful.  I saw some other reviewers recommend that you puree the sauce but I think that the texture of this sauce is intended to be somewhat thin and blending the shallots in would make it thick and lumpy.  I will definitely use this recipe when I cook the 2nd half!  UPDATE:  This sauce is my new favorite sauce recipe for any type of roasted beef.  It's very simple and you don't even need the bacon or shallots.  The last time I made it I used Zinfandel instead of Port.  I used it for sliced tri-tip and it was incredible.  It even reheats really well if you thin it just a bit with some water.  ",

I read all the reviews & made some changes based on them.  I made the sauce the day before & I was glad I did b/c it had time to flavor through. I used cabernat instead of port and added a 2 TBLS of brown sugar to it. Definitely double the sauce.  I tripled it & had just enough.  DEFINITELY use as many shallots as the recipe calls for if not more, they are wonderful.  They MAKE this recipe.  I pureed half of the shallots after I had roasted them as others suggested and was happy with the outcome.  I added some minced garlic to the sauce as well. It was wonderful.  I did NOT add any salt.  Be sure to let your meat sit 15 min after coming out of the oven (tented) so the juices can reabsorb.  I served it w/ garlic roasted mashed potatoes & glazed carrots. I will defintely make it again EXACTLY as I made it this time.  Mushrooms would make a great addition for those who like them.  If you don't want to spend the cash on the tenderloin, the sauce would be fantastic on just abt anything.  I have made it many more times since then & it always turns out fantastic.",

I splurged and went with a beautiful tenderloin and it was worth it.  I served the filets with rice pilaf and roasted veggies.  This is a major winner and a definite keeper!  Oh, and I didn't have port wine, so I used a non-alcoholic red wine and a touch of brown sugar and it was great.",

                "reviewBody": "The meat was tender but that's because it's 6 per pound tenderloin. The sauce was overrated. The shallots were yummy but I didn't like the port wine flavor at all. It was too overpowering. I cooked it down as stated and added it to the meat's drippings but my drippings did not amount to much since it seemed to evaporate as it cooked. Perhaps covering the meat or adding some (more) broth to the drippings would have diluted the strong grape flavor of the wine. Next time I'll opt for regular au jus.",
