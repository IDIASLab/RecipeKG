I added a minced garlic clove and threw in a little red bell pepper with the green to add a little color and sauted along with the onion in a tbsp extra virgin olive oil before adding the ground chicken. When I added the chicken I put a splash of garlic powder and oregano salt and pepper in it. Then added the soups and the fat free evaporated milk. The only thing I would have done differently to the finished product was throw in another layer of noodles. I did substitute some cheddar cheese for half of the mozerella also just because I didn't have enough. Turned out very tasty indeed! Not bland and very colorful! Enjoy!",

I also added minced garlic to the peppers when I fried them up. I also added garlic powder to each layer of the lasagna. The changes made it a very rich and filling lasagna.",
