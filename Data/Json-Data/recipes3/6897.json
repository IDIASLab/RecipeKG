I added two tablespoons of red wine vinegar oh my god good. This even smelled awesome while I made it and because of timing it didn't get to sit for long either. The red wine vinegar was even better than balsamic which I didn't think was possible. If I make this recipe again with fresh ingredients and enough time to marinate this recipe is 10 stars! I will make this again for sure!",

The tomatoes are or should be the star in this recipe and should be allowed to shine with the other ingredients as supporting actors. They should point up and celebrate the fresh delicate flavor of burstingly achingly ripe tomatoes. As written we found the garlic to be a \"spotlight ho.\" Perhaps sauteeing the garlic lightly in a bit of olive oil until just starting to color before adding would help this problem but I found that when I made the dish without any garlic whatsoever it was just about as close to perfection as it gets. And I'm a garlic lover so that says a lot!",
