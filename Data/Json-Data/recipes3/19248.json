The other reviews talked about how it was too rich and didn't reheat very well, so I used 8 oz. of lite Velveeta in place of the cream cheese. It created a very creamy sauce that reheated very well. Also, I made it low-fat by using reduced fat soup and reduced calorie salad dressing. VERY tasty! I'm going to try it again and freeze it for a friend who just had a baby!",

I added one whole can of chicken broth instead of a cup and left simmering a little longer than an hour. (It wasn't dry AT ALL) I added some frozen green beans and peas in that last hour. Right before serving I stirred in some chopped fresh cilantro...I had tasted it and it needed something so I tried the cilantro and it was GREAT! I served it over some stuffed ravioli I had in the freezer--it was mozzarella and spinach ravioli and I topped it all off with the herb and cheese mixture the ravioli came with. All in all it came out great...my husband and I both had seconds (thirds...).;o) I loved the sauce! Next time I'll try it with some chopped spinach mixed in... THANKS!",
