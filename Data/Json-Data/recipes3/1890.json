Looking at it more, it seemed to have strange proportions, especially if you expect to feed 4 people with the recipe, so I sort of winged it.\r\n\r\nI cooked the chicken, pulled it out of the pot leaving the liquid remaining, tossed in a boullion cube and about half cup each of Chardonnay and heavy cream.  I upped the vegetables considerably: 1 whole tomato (chopped), a whole head of broccoli florets (cut small to cook easier), a whole red bell pepper (julenned) and probably close to a cup of sliced mushrooms. I did leave it at just one can of hearts though. It was plenty.\r\n\r\nSomeone said this recipe was better the next day, but I wouldn't know, my tweaked version which probably should have fed 8 people or more if calculated against this recipe was demolished by 3 of us.",

I loved it!!! So did my husband. It would be great with shrimp too. Try it with whatever veggies you have on hand - great base to be creative!
