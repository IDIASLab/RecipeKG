I sauteed some chicken cut up into bite size pieces with some of the shallots and fresh garlic along with some baby spinach and prepared the sauce in another pan added some fresh parmesean and romano to thicken then once the sauce was ready added the chicken spinach mixture. My in-laws and husband went NUTS! It still goes together quite fast and heats up well for leftovers. Thanks for a good recipe",

Instead of using angel hair pasta I used spaghettini as it's all I had. I also didn't use clarified butter (but I didn't add the other 2 Tbsp of butter). As well I used half and half cream instead of whipping cream. The dish was ok but not worth the fat and calories IMHO so if I do make again (which is debatable) it won't be for awhile!",
