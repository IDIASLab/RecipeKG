I also didn't place the beef in a bowl after it was drained but stuck in right in the slow cooker because I didn't see the need to dirty up another bowl. I loved the idea of pickle juice but you really need to add more than 2 tablespoons if you want to taste it. This is a good dip and one that can easily be tweaked to your individual tastes. I'm confident this one would be a huge hit at any football party.",
