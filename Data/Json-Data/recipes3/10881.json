        "description": "Another recipe compiled from old recipes used in Pomerania, an ancient Germany region abutting the Baltic Sea, divided between Germany and Poland after World War II. The dumplings are very unusual in that they contain a combination of bread, meat, and dried fruit, and therefore can be served as an appetizer or as a very rich accompaniment to fowl, game, or pork dishes. I like to serve them with turkey at Thanksgiving, making dried cranberries one of the ingredients.",
