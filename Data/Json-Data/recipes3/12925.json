I read the reviews about the sauce being too thin and reduced the milk to 1 cup. I think any more milk and it would have been more fluid of a sauce than I prefer. I didn't want the pesto to overwhelm the cheese sauce so I reduced the pesto to 1/4 cup. The lovely part is this recipe is versatile. I split the batch and added some chopped cooked chicken into the second batch for a different variety. Pretty good recipe. Thanks!",

The cream sauce is much thinner than a traditional mac & cheese so when the macaroni baked it soaked it up. I think the flavor was good but I missed the creamy sauce you get from a traditional mac & cheese. The pesto flavor is predominate so I think you lose the flavor of the cheese. I did really love the taste. It was even better the next day!",

I left the bacon drippings in the pan with the butter as well so had a little extra bacon-ey goodness and evilness in the pan. The pesto made this extra special and my dish came out so rich creamy and really delicious. I loved it and my family did as well. (I also left off the panko breading and just sprinkled the extra chopped bacon on top when it was finished with the initial bake). Perfect for Easter dinner.",
