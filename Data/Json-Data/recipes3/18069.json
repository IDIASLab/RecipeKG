So I used 15 25 ounces Using a 1/4 measuring cup to fill I only got 18 cupcakes and not 24. I could not actually blend the strawberries in syrup with my electric mixer. Probable should puree them in a blender. Overall they were moist but other than the strawberries on top of the icing there really was no strawberry taste to the cupcake. Probably need to add strawberry extract to the cake mixture and use more of the strawberries in syrup both in the cake mixture and the icing. I will try this recipe again using 18.25 ounces of the cake mix this time instead of 15.25 ounces and add more of the syrup strawberries and the strawberry extract. I will need to buy 2 15.25 ounces of the cake mix to be able to get the required 18.25 ounces.",
