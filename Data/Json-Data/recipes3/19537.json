With the onion I added some finely chopped carrots & celery. It adds a little more flavor and a few vitamins. Plus kids hardly notice they are eating a few extra veggies. I cooked the veggies potatos and sausage on the stove in just one can of chicken broth. After I mashed the potatos a little I transfered everything to my crockpot added one can of evaporated milk and the velveeta cheese. It was easy to let it all blend together in the crock pot and I didn't have to watch it. We left and when we returned it was nice & thick and just needed to be stirred a little. I used only one can each of the broth & milk instead of two. To make it a little thinner I might add a little 2% or a little more broth next time. Like other reviewers I cut way back on the butter used to saute the veggies. I think a couple of tablespoons is sufficient. I also used a little less sausage and chopped it smaller than bite sized in order to appeal more to the younger members of the family. This one is definitely a keeper with these modifications for my house. I love any recipe that allows me to have the crockpot do the cooking while I'm away.",

I also added bits of smoked sausage BEFORE I added the stock.  Gave the soup more smoky, hearty flavor.  I also added a pinch cayenne (red pepper flakes or Tabasco would be good too).  Finally, I used 5 large baking potatoes and only 1 can of evaporated milk.  It made a ton of soup, and my picky boyfriend ate 2 heaping bowls!",

I use dehydrated onion and leave out the margarine completely. I also use beef broth instead of chicken (I've made it both ways and we like the beef best). I know it would be less fat using turkey sausage but the beef tastes so much better.:oP I normally slice and cook the sausage separately and drain it well to remove quite a bit of fat before adding to the soup. Make some homemade bread with this and you've got a stick-to-your-ribs meal that is true comfort food on a cold winter's day.:o) Thanks so much!",

I did make a few changes in that I used whole milk instead of evaporated added minced garlic while sauteing the onions used only five potatoes instead of six and added chopped broccoli to it as well. I also didn't bother to peel the potatoes and didn't really mash it all that much since I prefer the potato chunks. It was relatively easy to make though and I will definitely be making this again when we're in a soup mood.",

Instead of cooking it all on the stove I moved it to the crock pot when it was time to add the cheese. I also added 1/2 bag of shredded mozzarella and shredded cheddar to it. It cooked on high in the crock pot for about an hour...until all the cheese was melted. This was definitely easy to make and tasted wonderful!!!!! Everyone LOVED it!!",
