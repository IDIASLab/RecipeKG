Crush oreos, then put into a food processor. Add the cream cheese but make sure it's softed to a spreadable state. The quickest way to do this is by throwing it in a microwave in a bowl. Mix until the mixture is nice and black. \n2. Chill this mix in the fridge or the freezer. If planning on working on these in the same day, the freezer works. \n3. Ball up the mix. This stuff will be warm so put it in the freezer. \n4. Coat with chocolate. Don't use almond bark or imitation, people can tell the difference. Dark chocolate is rich; milk chocolate will taste like a hot cocoa ball; white chocolate has a great contrast. Most people who don't care for white chocolate like this one the best. \n5. For dipping chocolate: warm up water to 180 degrees. If you have an electric tea kettle it works pretty well. I don't have a double boiler so I find a large pot and fill it with 2\" of water. Then, I have a metal mixing bowl to put the chocolate in. I don't take out all the balls from the freezer; instead, take out about 20 at a time. They'll keep form better when dipping. I use a teaspoon to toss chocolate on then place onto parachment paper.",

I made a few dipped in chocolate and then the chocolate got too hot and thick and wouldn't melt correctly. The few that I was able to dip were Way too chocolaty I couldnt even taste the oreos. I decided to roll the rest in powdered sugar and that was so much easier and tasted much better!!!!Also the recipe only made about 28 one inch balls, so you may want to double it",

I then hand-stirred the cream cheese and Oreos until evenly mixed. I used a tablespoon to scoop out the globs of Oreo and placed them on a wax paper-covered baking sheet. After placing them in the fridge for 30 min (or freezer for less), I hand rolled them into a nice round ball. Also, using a double boiler is fantastic for melting chocolate. I added a small handful of chocolate chips at a time and stirred occasionally until it was all melted over low heat. I let the chocolate cool some, and then put a couple of Oreo balls in at a time and rolled them around in the chocolate bowl with my fingers for even coverage. Chilled them again in fridge for a few hours and they came out perfectly.",
