I changed a couple of things as follows:  I omitted the oregano and added garlic and  cayenne pepper - didn't measure but was about 1/2 teaspoon each.  I added 2 cups of baby spinach.  I also used a whole large yellow onion and my onion was saut\u00e9ed with the sausage.  After pouring the egg mixture over the sausage and onion I did stir it up to mix it all in.  I'm sure the addition of the spinach made it a big chunkier than just pouring egg over it.  Lastly I save about 1/2 cup of cheese to sprinkle around the top.  Bon Appetit!",
