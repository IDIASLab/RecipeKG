                "reviewBody": "This recipe works GREAT provided a few basic frying rules are adhered to:\n\n1)  DO NOT fry past the point when no air escapes the food.  The minute steam stops coming out grease is getting in.  \n\n2)  Keep finished pieces in a 250 degree oven until the last one is done, right before serving.  The heat will keep the oil draining off and the batter crispy.\n\n3)  Make SURE the oil temperature is hot enough.  The MINUTE the food goes in the oil loses a good 25-50 degrees worth of heat.  A great candy/fry thermometer or digital thermister is key to keeping a constant oil temp, and adjusting as needed every time food goes in wll keep the results uniform and the food looking good.\n\n\nThis batter is wonderful with beer instead of milk, or in addition to, and small pieces of fish fry more evenly than entire filets.  Keep the basic frying rules in mind and it becomes quite simple to make crispy, NOT GREASY fish and chips with ease.  The other quick tip I'd give is make SURE the food is good and cold, especially the potatoes, before trying to fry.  That will help the them not become limp too.",

With regards to this recipe, the chips were quite good (make sure you cut them nice and chunky, not skinny little fries). The fish batter, however, wasn't good - bland and oily, and it turned mushy while the other pieces of fish were being cooked. I MUCH prefer the beer batter in the 'Fish Tacos' recipe submitted by Tanya; the batter is light, crispy, flavorful - exactly how it should be. Thanks anyway.",

Put chicken and potatoes in freezer for about 15 - 20 min just to chill.  2)batter needs to be cold as well.  Put batter in fridge for the same duration and you will notice that the batter stays on and fries up better.  Also, for better fried consistency, keep frying oil moving.  When deep frying, move the fish and chips around in the oil.  This will give you consistancy.  Really great recipe.",
