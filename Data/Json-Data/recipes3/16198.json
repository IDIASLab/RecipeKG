Word of caution though:  be careful with the cayenne pepper if you do not like it too spicy.  Otherwise go for it!!!  Instead of oregano which I did not have on hand, I threw in some sage, rosemary and thyme (all fresh) and  WOW! it was what took this recipe to the next level!  The herbs were crunchy and I put them on top of the potatoes.  Not only was it delicious but added to the presentation.  Thanks Chef John for this wonderful recipe which I will be fixing a lot!",

There was some initial hesitation because the video does not instruct on how long to roast the potatoes for the final homestretch.  My potatoes were much smaller than his and they were in for at least 30 minutes and still weren't crispy like his (still quite a bit of olive oil pooled on the bottom).  So after thirty minutes, I turned on the broiler for 7-8 minutes and got a little crisp, but basically wrecked my pan by burning on the remnants at the bottom.  So I finally got a little crisp, but upon eating them, they just didn't have that much flavor.  I used plenty of lemon zest and juice and a lot of pepper, but the dish was just bland.  This recipe, especially given the amount of work involved, just isn't one I'd use again.  I'd prefer a normal baked potato.",

Then I drained off the extra lemon/broth so that the rest could be absorbed. When serving I drizzled it back on the potatoes instead of the oil suggested. Delicious.",
