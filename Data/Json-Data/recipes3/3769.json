I had to add more milk to reduce the intensity of the chili powder though once tempered the flavor of the gravy rocks. I had to add several eggs to the egg mixture. There wasn't enough egg batter for the meat. Too consider leaving the flour out of the egg. Yes it might make the coating thicker but it is VERY hard to work with and doesn't stick easily to the meat. My mother always dipped the meat in egg alone and I think that works best. I bought tenderized round steak on sale which also is what mom used. All in all--an excellent recipe with with the modifications just mentioned.",

The batter was not too thick, but the crispy covering it made to the steaks was scrumdelicious.  We all chowed down on this one.  Mashed Potatoes and corn was perfect.  And some garlic cheese biscuits!  Heavenly.",
