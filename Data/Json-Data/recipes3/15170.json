I've never had any luck getting loin to shred so I used a pork butt roast instead. The one thing I did not like about the recipe is that visually the cabbage gets lost even though the flavor is there. Next time I will wait a couple of hours before adding any of it. I ended up adding the sesame oil  when shredding the pork so that it would be more evenly distributed. Overall this is a really good recipe and one I would make again.",
