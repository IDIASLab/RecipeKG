I used black beans and pintos instead of black-eyed peas added only 1 tsp of Tabasco and then put the bottle at the table for additional spiciness. As I always do with bean dishes like this I added just a splash of olive oil and vinegar right before serving. It's really low in calories and fat has good fiber not too high in carbs so you can enjoy this with a clear conscience. Served with sliced red jalapeno peppers chopped green onions and a dollop of sour cream.",
