I read all the reviews and made some changes:  I omitted the orange peel, substituted 2 tsp of sesame oil for the 2 tbl vegetable oil, used 3 cloves of garlic, substituted 1 tsp candied ginger (minced) for the 1/2 tsp of powdered ginger, I used orange juice in place of the sherry, used \"sweet orange marmalade,\" and added 2 tsp brown sugar to the sauce.  I marinated the beef in 1 cup of orange juice for several hours (this helped tenderize it).  I drained the beef and then stir fried it in 1 tsp sesame oil.  I removed the beef, drained out the juices, added another tsp of sesame oil to the pan and then stir fried red bell pepper (cut in strips), broccoli, and carrots (cut in strips) until just tender, then I added the garlic and ginger, stirred, then added the beef back to the pan.  I immediately poured in the sauce.  Just before removing from the heat, I added snow pea pods and green onions.  I served it over brown rice.  This was an awesome one dish meal.  I used about 9 ounces of meat, so my version served two large portions.",

I upped the garlic slightly and doubled the amount of red pepper because we like very spicy food. And I added fresh mushrooms and carrots after the meat was done cooking. The orange flavor is subtle and the sauce is thick sticky and delicious over rice. I would like to know if there's a reason you're supposed to cook the beef in batches? I cooked it all at once then drained the liquid from the wok then returned the beef and veggies to the wok and finished cooking and it was fine. BTW this would be even better with chicken. I think another reviewer said this was like eating at a good Asian restaurant -- I got that same impression! You have to try this recipe!",

Firstly the 1/4 cup of orange peel seemed a bit scary so I took a prior reviewer's advice and made very wide strips of peel so their flavor came through but you didn't get mouthfuls of peel in every bite. I used fresh ginger instead of ground. After browning the beef and before adding in the peel garlic and ginger I added 1/2 cup of sliced onion and cooked a few minutes before continuing with the rest of the recipe. And finally I threw some snow pea pods in at the end to add some color.",

I used round steak and I cut it into thin strips marinated it in soy sauce garlic red pepper flakes and the juice of one orange. I then stir fried it adding in the ginger and 4 big chunks of orange peel. Then I added the broth soy sauce red pepper flakes cornstarch and orange marmalade mixture. This was OUTSTANDING!!!!!! Next time I think I will use a different cut of meat but other than that...oh and I also added shredded carrots and water chestnuts...very VERY good. I will also add broccoli next time as that would just make it over the top wonderful. Thank you so much for this recipe and the suggestions by those who came before me!",

I too did not put in the orange zest as suggested by many of the other reviewers and I think the orange taste was strong enough. I fried the beef in a little sesame oil and added in some thai chili paste (hot hot hot! I add this to almost every meat I stir fry) and only added scallions for vegetables. I doubled the amount of sauce next time I will probably just do 1 1/2 times the sauce unless I add more vegetables. The sauce thickened up immediately after putting it in the hot pan definitely do not walk away from it.",
