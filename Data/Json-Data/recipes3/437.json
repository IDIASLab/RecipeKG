I like a bit more sweetness so I added sweet ghirardelli cocoa powder and 2 tbsp of vanilla and I use cream soda to add to sweetness. I also go overboard sometimes and add ghirardelli chocolate chips to it too (we're both choco-holics). For a little more fluff I add 1tsp of distilled white vinegar.",
