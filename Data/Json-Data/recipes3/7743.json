I added some garlic along with the onion and doubled up on the sauce but I didn't and wouldn't alter anything else about this recipe at all.  Why mess with perfection? Everything is right with this recipe from the ingredients, to the instructions for its preparation, to the cooking time. And it is just SO delicious!  The chicken is moist and tender and the sauce rich and velvety smooth, with well chosen ingredients that all combine into something simply sublime - how can you go wrong with a sauce made pf chicken broth,wine, Dijon, sour cream and tarragon?  Hubs and I were really impressed - but more important, we thoroughly enjoyed every bite.",
