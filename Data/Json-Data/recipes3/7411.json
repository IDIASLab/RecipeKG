Update -- 03/27/2012 -- Since my husband is on the South Beach Diet (and 30 pounds down in 9 wks!) I decided to try this recipe replacing the bread crumbs with crushed plain pork rinds. Absolutely delicious!! In fact we liked this version way better than the one with the bread crumbs. I did add Italian Seasoning to the rinds. Wouldn't want to eat this way every night because of the extra fat but it is low carb and keeps his weight off!",
