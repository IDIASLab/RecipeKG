                "reviewBody": "APRIL 2010 UPDATE  From: Buddy Sizemore\nOver the years I've experimented with my original  Oyster Stew recipe, so I wanted to share the following information with you folks. \nA nice addition to my recipe would be to finely minced one large potato (I like Yukon Gold best), then saut\u00e9 the potato with the minced celery and shallots.\nAlso, after considering some of the comments that  a couple of viewers mentioned concerning the \"floating\" celery and shallots that their husbands didn't particularly care for, I experimented using a microplane to finely grate both the shallots and celery then add them in with the butter and finely minced potato. Before I microplaned the celery I cut the stringy layer off the celery stalks. This is easy to do with a potato peeler This is only a suggestion for thoes who may not like the larger peices of celery and shallots but still want the flavors. I however enjoy the texture.\n\nAnother tip would be to allow the half & half or whipping cream (which ever you use) to come to room temperature. Also drain the liquid from the   oysters then add it to the half & half at the beginning of cooking . This will cut down the time it takes to bring the mixture to a rolling simmer/boil.\n This is my family's favorite indlugence. \n  I ALWAYS USE FRESH OYSTERS!\nThank's to all who have posted reviews, I'm thrilled that the majority enjoy my recipe! And, with respect to the FEW negative reviews...well that just leaves more stew for the of us! \nBuddy Sizemore",

Buy oysters in the shell even if you never opened one as you can pop them in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes to loosen them up and then use a paring knife to cut the meat from the shell. This is oyster season (R months) and 2 dozen oysters is enough for this recipe. Reserve all liquid exuding from the oysters and strain before adding to the stew. The microwave method seems like a hideous shortcut but opening them by hand at the last minute for dinnertime is a pain too! Good cooking!",

HOWEVER you MUST keep stirring. I got distracted and it boiled and curdled a bit. But still yum. Next time I'll search harder for shallots and add more pepper. Dice the celery finer too. A potoato would be a good touch... make it go further. Will revisit for the holidays. Thanks!!",
