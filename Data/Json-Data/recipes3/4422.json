I seldom give 5 stars to any recipe, but this one was / is worthy. \"Quiche\" is inaccurate as there is no crust, but as I searched for a great quiche I found this, lucky. My wife needed a dish for a girls-only brunch so I tried this. I subbed HOT sausage and the HOT Rotel tomatoes in lieu of the spices & peppers. I mixed the Rotels with the eggs, then sprinkled a little cheese over the top. I cooked mine 30 minutes as the additional liquid from the Rotels required more cook time to evaporate. VERY TASTY !!! EMPTY DISH!! Wife HAPPY!! Life is good!!!",
