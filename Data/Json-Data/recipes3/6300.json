I followed the recipe exactly except of course the amount of time to cook.  I seared it on high for a few minutes on each side, turned down to medium and then moved to the other side of the grill.  Cooked it for 10 - 12 minutes and it was perfect! Was very tender, flavorful and tasty. I put the rub on earlier in the day and left it on a dish in the fridge covered with saran. I took it out about an hour before cooking. I'll definitely make this again.",

It couldn't be simpler. The second time I made this I considered using fresh thyme from my garden but hey if it ain't broke don't fix it. We usually make more than we need. Nothing like filet and eggs the next morning followed by steak panini's for lunch. Highly recommended!",

Also if you are using a tenderloin in the 3.5LB range you can half the recipe for the wet rub and there is still plenty. Thanks for the great recipe.
