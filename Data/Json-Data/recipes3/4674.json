I had to alter it substantially to get something we were happy eating.  First up, you need a flavourful sauce as a sturdy base for the pasta.  After browning the meat and onions, add the tomatoes, salt and pepper, and extra seasonings of oregano, garlic, and parsley (a splash of red wine is not only traditional but delicious), and allow to simmer until slightly reduced and flavourful.  Only then should you add the pasta and cheeses.  The white sauce is also very weak:  thin-looking and thin-tasting.  It needs to be made with all purpose flour, and it also needs seasoning with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  I give my own variation five stars, but the original is only two.  Sorry!",

I used flavored feta cheese and added spices typical of other Greek recipes I have (since I couldn't find a Greek spice at the store) and it was very flavorful. I layered it pasta first then the feta cheese then beef tomatoes and finally Parmesan. I added a clove of garlic to the beef and onion during cooking. This is also where I added 2 t. chili powder 2 t. ground cumin and 1/4 t. ground red pepper along with the 2 t. cinnamon. I drained the tomatoes of their juice and added 3 T. of lime juice to them. My whole family loved it and I will most definitely make it again...soon.",

Essentially this dish takes four pans -- one to cook the meat one to boil the pasta one to prepare the white sauce and one to bake. It's not as quick and easy as it sounds. If you already have cooked ground beef in your freezer or some cooked pasta ready I'd probably recommend this recipe. It's filling and pairs nicely with salad. It's just a little bland. I did use only half of the pasta I added some grated cheese to the top. I do wish I had layered it as the noodles on the top got unpleasantly crispy. If you have to make the whole thing from scratch I don't think it's quite worth the effort.",

I added one package of feta to the sauce. I combined the beef sauce and pasta in the casserole. For the white sauce I used the same amount of butter 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of flour and 4 cups of milk seasoned with salt and peper. I put 1/2 container of lowfat feta in this sauce and poured it over the pasta mixture. I sprinkled the rest of the feta on the top. I baked it for 25 minutes. My husband rated it a five.",
