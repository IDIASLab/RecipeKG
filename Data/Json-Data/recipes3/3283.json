It's so easy and trust me...I hate capers, but they add just the right flavor.  If you really don't like capers, put them in a empty tea bag, fasten with a twist tie and throw it away before serving, but trust me I've had no complaints! This is a perfect dinner to entertain with or just for a romantic night for two. Suggestion: Have a nice but simple spinach salad and a good gourmet Italian bread with it.",

Slightly salty taste but it added a true depth to the dish that I will want to recreate many times over. oh if i had a suggestion it would be to double the amount of zucchini and use 1/4 inch thickness when slicing.",
