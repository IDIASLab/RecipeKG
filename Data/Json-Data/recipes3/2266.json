I didn't add amt of salt and pepper from recipe I added it near the end a little at a time and kept tasting it. I also added 3/4 stick of butter it added a creamy buttery taste to it.I put it in a crockpot to keep it warm(amount from recipe filled crockpot perfectly). I served it in round bread bowls hollowed out and topped with crumbled bacon and shredded chedder cheese. I'll be making this one for years to come it's great!!!!!",

Then I add the veggies to the potatoes after they are cooked and use the veggies broth to whip the potatoes. Then add all the rest of the ingredients and heat through. I will sometimes add some cooked ham or shredded cheese or even chopped green chili for a little variety. Wonderful!",
