It was terrific even with adjustments which reduced the fat to 54% (still high) and the calories by 2/3.  Used 1 lb green beans for 4 servings, not 6.  Steamed the beans in the microwave for 5 minutes, meanwhile cooked 2 slices of bacon.  Poured off all but 1 tsp drippings and added 1 tsp canola oil.  Deglazed the pan with 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar.  Stir fried the beans and 2 Tbsp walnuts for about 1 minute.  Crumbled the bacon and 2 Tbsp blue cheese on top. Fabulous, rich flavor combination, definitely company quality, and ready in about 10 minutes.",

Fried up a couple pieces turkey bacon then tossed the green beans in the pan (only had a tbs. or so of drippings so it wasn't too greasy or fatty) and cut the bacon into small pieces and tossed that in also.
