I cooked 2 cups rice in 4 cups chicken broth with green onion pepper and garlic then mixed in a large can of chili beans. Combined the sour cream with the green chiles and a packet of taco seasoning then layered the components like the recipe said and baked like the recipe said. This made 8 large servings and leftovers were great in flour tortillas with lettuce tomatoes and salsa. Either in tortillas or plain this turned out really well (my fiance loved it) and I'll make it again. Also KKH3 must have done something wrong with their rice. There's no reason for rice to cook differently in broth than water and the liquid to rice ratio described in the recipe should be just fine.",

I realized halfway through making this that I didn't have canned chiles so I added other hot spices to make up for it. The way I made this it was about a 3. I think if I had the correct ingredients and made it according to the recipe it would have been a 4. Still it's mainly just rice and sour cream but it's got a lot of potential. You could easily add chicken or hamburg tomatoes etc. to this and make it what you want it to be. Think of it as an enchilada with rice instead of a tortilla and just have fun with it. I will make this again but will follow the recipe and maybe add a few other things in for fun.",
