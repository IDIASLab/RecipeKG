I halved the recipe since there's only the two of us and our 20 month old to feed. I added a little bit of fresh minced garlic in with the onions and used Adobo in place of the salt and pepper. Because one of the reviewers wrote that the chicken they made had a bitter taste to it I added the zest from the half the orange I juiced instead of adding the lime peel (which I'm guessing was what caused the bitterness). I might make this again - it did come out moist and the flavor is fine but the onions just get cooked translucent - they don't brown at all in the bottom of the dish while it's cooking. Maybe next time I'll try browning them separately and adding them to the dish once the chicken is cooked.",
