Between the wine and the capers I didn't think the lemon was necessary, so I left it out and simply served the fish with lemon wedges on the side. Confident or experienced cooks needn't bother with measuring ingredients--just cook away and enjoy yourself! Pour in a glug or two of wine, reduce a bit, pour in a couple glugs of cream, then add herbs and capers to suit your taste.  Simply beautiful, and simply delicious.",

Fairly simple (as long as you have all the ingredients on hand) and it makes for a beautiful presentation. I did not add the capers though. I served this dish with french bread (bread is a must for the yummy sauce), and garlic-parmesan green beans. I am not sure if the green bean recipe is from here or not-I got it somewhere online! You snap off both ends of the fresh green beans, blanch them in a pan in enough water to cover, strain & run under cold water, return to the pan and  stir fry them in some butter. Then sprinkle them with garlic salt, pepper, and a good amount of parmesan cheese. ",

I used light butter and used half the basil and parsley (for 2 halibut steaks) and 1/4 cup of the heavy cream used one lemon etc. I thought the sauce would boil away but it didn't. My mother doesn't drink any alcohol so I added mine after I dished hers out. I did not use salt instead using a very light sprinkle of Cajun seasoning (I'm supposed to not use salt so I cheat with Cajun seasoning which has salt but it makes me feel like I'm not using salt). I had leftover halibut from a seafood company that delivers and swore I couldn't wait to never buy halibut again but I've changed my mind. This was EXCELLENT. I am shocked at how good it was. And I am no chef. I usually don't follow directions well (hence no capers). I ate salad with no dressing to go with the meal as I'm trying to watch my weight. Haven't added up the calories but it was as filling as eating 2 potatoes!",

I followed recipe exactly and the only thing I would do different next time is add half the fresh squeezed lemon. I think fresh squeezed lemon is more potent than lemon juice(?). This recipe is better than any halibut ordered from a restaurant. My dinner guests complimented the meal at least 5 different times. I will definitly make this again and try the sauce with chicken and bowtie pasta. Thank you!!!! I have made this 3 times within 2 weeks!!! Simply FABULOUS!",
