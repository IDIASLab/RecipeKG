My suggestions are that you will need more powdered sugar than stated.  Put a few of the hot cookies at a time into a paper bag with the sugar in, shake gently to coat, remove and set aside on a rack to cool. The first coating with sugar will get soft from the heat, then when they are completely cooled, coat again and the sugar will adhere to the first coating making the outside nice and white. ",

Here's the way the \"holy grail\" (hahahaha!)has been handed down all these years to me: 1. Don't over chill them. About thirty minutes is good. 2. Don't make them too big. These are supposed to be dainty cookies. 3. These cookies don't spread so you can add a few more than normal. Also unless you have a convection oven don't try to put more than one sheet in your oven. 4. Bake these cookies until they are just barely turning golden on the bottom because they will continue to cook on the sheet. These cookies should be \"tender\" and melt in your mouth. Not crunchy. 5. Because you have left them till they are just barely golden on the bottom do not repeat do not move them from the sheet until they are almost completely cool or they will fall apart. 6. This is the tricky part. You need to roll? toss? dust? them in the powdered sugar without busting them. I was shown to do it in a bowl about half full of podered sugar one at a time cradling them in my fingers back and forth. (I know sounds crazy!) Ok I'll stop yacking now! Again thanks for posting THE ORIGINAL recipe!",

But I used a metal bowl to chill it to keep it cooler longer and found that I over chilled and had to use my hand warmth to get the dough to roll up. Also don't leave the hot balls in the powdered sugar too long or the sugar starts to become frosting and then there's a mess! But I had never made anything like them before and I learned a bunch. They are also very tasty and easy once you get the hang of it.",
