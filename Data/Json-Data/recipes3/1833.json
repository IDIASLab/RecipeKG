I used all ingredients as listed but had to add an extra 1/2 cup milk to the batter since it was way too thick. I also adjusted cooking time/temp (personal preference with my oven and prior muffin trials) to 375 for 22 minutes perfect! I got 11 standard sized muffins had to leave one tin empty. I will be making these again very soon I'm sure. I think I would decrease the salt to 1/2 teaspoon since it's a tad salty along with the additional milk and everything else stays the same. Love the slight paprika taste -- the cheddar and raisins go great together! Thanks so much for this recipe!",

I also added chopped up raw onion (altho I think I would saute those next time) chopped roasted green chili and chopped fresh spinach.
