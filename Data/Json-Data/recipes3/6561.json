I only gave four stars because the bread was a little weird. Maybe next time I will toast it or something. I know a cheesesteak doesn't have toasted bread but it's also not swimming in cheese sauce. It made the bread a little doughy. Leftovers this morning are not quite as good as the dish was for dinner last night so I would recommend trying to consume it all in one fell swoop. A great recipe though. Definitely worth trying and possibly making again! Thanks!",

I then put it under the broiler for 2 minutes to firm & crisp. No beer either, used drippings from the beef and beef broth, as suggested also. Due to the Stuffing, I lessened all spices, especially salt. I know I tweeked it a bit, but this recipe is AWESOME.",

I made it with frozen Philly steaks which I'm sure affected the quality slightly. (Next time I would cook the steaks as directed on the package in a skillet instead of heating them along with the spices and broth.)Not having beer I used beef broth and a little balsamic vinegar. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because my hubby thought the bread on the bottom was too soggy but our preferences differ on this point. The cheese on top gave it a great texture to balance the soggy bread in my opinion. Thanks for a great idea!",
