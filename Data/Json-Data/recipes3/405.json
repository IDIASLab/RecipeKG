I didn't have a white mix but a yellow instead so just added a few drops of green food coloring to the cake batter.  I like this better than the Watergate I recipe because of the coconut.  I did use a stabilizer (mrs. Oedeker's) since I didn't know if folks would refrigerate right away.  Used a store brand version of Dream Whip and it came out perfect.  I didn't have lemon-lime carb. soda so used some Aquafina brand Citrus blend carbonated water.  Any carbonated clear beverage would do.  Placed a cherry atop each cupcake.  Looks really cute and festive.",
