You can reduce that by replacing some of the flour with whey protein, also.  I personally do not use poppy seeds, so I replaced those with chia seeds and did 2Tbsp. Also, I suspected it would not be lemony enough for my tastes, so I added 1/2 tsp lemon oil. I will do 1tsp next time! Also, I didn't have any sour cream so I used very thick, plain Greek yogurt. They were fantastic, thank you for sharing!",

Today I used Splenda sugar blend (.25 cups per batch) and they are perfect.  I made a double batch but used all of the mix in 12 average size muffin tins which made them a bit larger, but better in my opinion.  I baked them at 350 for 14 minutes and they are perfect.  Next time I will try erythritol again in a larger quantity to test the sweetness without adding carbs.  I also would like to try coconut oil in place of butter.",
