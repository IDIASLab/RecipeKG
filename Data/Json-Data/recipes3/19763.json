Wipe off the knife frequently - they turned out perfect! Thanks for the recipe Lisa! Tracy",

Next time I make them I will add a layer of chopped or sliced prosciutto (strong-flavoured salty Italian cured ham) to liven them up.

Any other additions that could 'brighten' these up also couldn't hurt.",
