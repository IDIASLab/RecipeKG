I prepared the batter this morning and followed the directions. I used a 9X9 pan and put it in the oven at 6:27am. At 7:30 it was still a little jiggly but I didn't want it over done and I had to leave for work so took it out of the oven. At 3:30 this afternoon it was still WET in the middle. I have no idea how this could possibly be done baking in 20 minutes. I gave it over an hour and it still wasn't done. It's a shame because it tasted really good. We ate a little around the edges that were done more than the middle but most of it ended up in the trash. I might try again because I really liked the flavor but would definitely put this in a 9X13 pan.",

My husband increased the temperature and left them in for about 15 minutes. They were still wet in the middle. We let the pan sit for 20 minutes before tasting the sides of the pan. They were awesome but we still had to throw it out. I wish I would of seen the reviews. Allrecipes should make the change on the recipe. They need to be baked in a bigger pan. I used the recommended 9X9. I will try these again in a bigger pan. The coconut/pecans add the \"Wow\" factor in them.",
