Use fresh baby spinach, fresh is always better.  Skip the mozzarella, it detracts from the dish.  I actually put the fresh spinach in the cream mixture and cook the spinach that way.  I spread the spinach and cream mixture over the scallops, top off with a dusting of italian seasoned bread crumbs, a nice mix of romano and parm cheese and then a very light dusting of Creole seasoning.  This really adds some flavor.  Bake at the temp suggested for 10 minutes then broil for the remaining 5 min.  Really works nicely.  Serve with Basil rice for a real treat.",

I substituted half-and-half for the heavy cream and used unsalted butter.  I used just a sprinkling of Old Bay, pepper and mozzarella before baking.  I did not precook the scallops, and baked the whole thing for 25 minutes.  The scallops came out perfectly done- the sauce had lots of flavor, without overpowering the scallops.  My husband declared it a home run.\r\nNote:  One night when we had unexpected company, I added a pound of shrimp to the mix and it made this recipe twice as good.  I will use a combination of one pound shrimp, one pound sea scallops from now on.  The loaded-with-seafood approach makes it absolutely stunning.",

                "reviewBody": "We just had this tonight - and it was great! My partner insists he is not much on \"seafood\" unless it is fried catfish or shrimp. He also has a strong aversion to \"foo-foo\" food which this clearly is. Even at that - he put this in the recipe book himself!! I made a few changes: Deleted - Old Bay Seasoning (I don't like the taste of it). Also did not precook the scallops based on other reviews - it was a good call. I also have a way of making the sauce without the added butter. The less fat in this dish the more often we can have it! Added - 2 cups cooked rice to bottom of dish (I'd prefer a wild/brown mixture myself but SOMEBODY only likes white rice ). Topped with 5-6 mushrooms sliced & sauted. Substitutions - 5 Italian Cheese mix for mozzerella and non-fat half & half for heavy cream (yes they do make such a thing). I also used fresh spinach (1 bunch) but I think I will use whole leaf frozen next time and see how that works. If not then I will use 2 bunches of fresh - dry fry until soft and lay out in a layer over scallops. Things to change for next time - make a double batch of sauce. This was certainly a great dish not much work and well worth the effort. I would serve it to company any day. I can see that it can be made up ahead of time and refrigerated before baking. Serve with a salad maybe bread and something very light for dessert. Even without the salad this will serve 6 at our house easily.",

I used 1/2 pound each of shrimp and scallops. To further make it \"my own\" I added a dash each of onion powder and garlic salt in place of the Old Bay seasoning. To cut down on the fat a little I used half-and-half in place of the heavy cream and Smart Balance in place of the butter. A suggestion - Wondra Flour for sauces blends smoother than regular flour. Another great alteration was adding 3/4 cup chopped artichoke hearts. I also put the seafood in without cooking it first. Cook for 25-30 minutes and it comes out just fine! Fantastic recipe thanks!",

I used less Old Bay than called for- I think a tablespoon might make it too salty. Also I don't think this takes 30 minutes prep time as the recipe says. I cooked the spinach in the micro while I made the sauce. It takes a minute or so to press the water from the spinach and then the recipe goes together quickly. I put the scallops directly in the pie plate instead of boiling. So prep time is less than 15 minutes. I would rather spend less prep time and a little more time in the oven so I can do some other things while it cooks. My husband who is usually neutral on scallops really liked this and I did too. Whenever I make scallops I'll use this recipe from now on.",

I too read the other reviews and did not cook the scallops ahead of time I used fresh baby spinach used milk instead of cream italian bread crumbs -- and I added some fresh crushed garlic not alot but it just gave the sauce a hint of it -- YUM!!!! I also elimated the mozzarella b/c the parmesan is perfect!!! Served it over NO YOLK noodles!!! We loved it!!! Thanks for sharing Deb!!!!",

I also cut way back on the Old Bay because of reviewers who had found it salty. It was still very salty probably due to the parmesan cheese. I may try it again someday by substituting other white cheeses for most of the parmesan and sticking with just a sprinkling of Old Bay or substituting other herbs for that too.",
