Also I used 1 cup salsa in place of 1 cup chicken broth-- I make a similar recipe all the time and thought this would help with flavor. Even with the salsa added I thought this still needed a bit more flavor-- the taco seasoning in this recipe could probably use some garlic powder and a few shakes of cayenne pepper. We used this for chicken soft tacos and everyone liked them.",
