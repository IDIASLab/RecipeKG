I used my own whole wheat crust and omitted the banana peppers because I had none - added a little chopped red bell pepper and a few mushrooms I needed to use up. The addition of chicken makes this a very hearty meaty pizza and I love that unmistakeable chourico flavor and the garlicky sauce. Thanks Raquel!",
