However, my husband loves it so I decided to give it a try.  I found this recipe right here online and gave it a go.  I ABSOLUTELY  loved it.  LOVED it!  The recipe was fabulous (although I added plenty more garlic to mine).  I took this photo of my first ever pride and joy lamb roast and have served it to guests three times now.  They all raved about how delicious, juicy and tender it was.  So, I thought I'd share my photo with all of you.   I threw the potatoes and carrots in just to add some color to the photo.  Enjoy!",
