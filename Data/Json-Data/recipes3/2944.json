I didn't have a food processor so I mixed it in a blender and added less than 1/4 cup water to help my blender mix it. It still came out thicker than store bought and was excellent. Next time I might use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Also for hot sauce i used habanero sauce and it blended nicely with the avocados.",

The key is to let it all set in the refrig for a few hours. Great with multigrain chips and beer with lime!",
