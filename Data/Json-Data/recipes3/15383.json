But based on this recipe I'd have to say I'm not a semisweet chocolate kinda gal. I would try milk chocolate next time. The peanut butter was very messy to apply to the frozen bananas. I'm thinking melting the peanut butter and milk chocolate together might be the way to go. Or using nutella like others mentioned would be good. However they were also very difficult to eat. Admittedly I didn't have them on popsicle sticks--they were just little chunks of banana. But the frozen bananas were rock solid. I ate a few that way then tried thawing them for a bit but then they got all mushy and kinda gross. I guess this isn't the recipe for me. Thanks for sharing. I'm glad others love it!",

I used 1/2 a bag of mini baking chocolate chips with 2 tablespoons of crisco shortening. Melt in microwave in 30 seconds stir and put back in microwave for another 30 seconds at 70%. Just stir until it's all melted. I also cut the banana in quarters rather than half for a quick treat. They were frozen within an hour. FYI..definately use bananas that are still yellow and slightly green. Anything more or less will not have as pleasant a taste or texture.",
