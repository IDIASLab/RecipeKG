I am suspecting that is because of the ratio of orange juice to mango. Next time I make this I will probably double up on the mango or possibly use a mixture of 1/2 canned mango nectar and 1/2 orange juice rather than all orange juice. Very satisfied overall especially to have a fairly healthy chicken recipe that gives a different flavor from lemon chicken or BBQ chicken!",
