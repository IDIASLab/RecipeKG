                "reviewBody": "First a disclaimer: I'm gaga for rosemary. So much so that I misread the recipe and added rosemary both to the butter as well as the steak. But not to worry: it's one tasty dish. I used T-Bone rather than Porterhouse because that's what they had at the market. I overcooked it a bit but even at that this is a lovely way to BBQ steak. The papaya adds a subtle but definitely wonderful flavor to the mix. This is one of those home-run recipes that you might expect to get at a restaurant. In other words exquisite. A comment about grilling the papaya: I simply cut half a papaya into four long slices (about 1\" thick/slice). Even after coating the grill with oil the papaya wound up sticking a bit. So keep your eye on it. But don't leave it out! It's the real hero of this recipe... although my beloved rosemary surely carries its weight.",
