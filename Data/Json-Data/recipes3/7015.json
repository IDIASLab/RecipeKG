That's primarily because cottage cheese does not exist in Hungary. We use \"t\u00far\u00f3\" (hence the name) which is a slightly curdier version of what you buy in the US as farmers' cheese. We don't mix the pasta with sour cream, rather the cheese itself, and top it with the sour cream before putting it in the oven. Alternatively, the sour cream is mixed in with the cheese. Trust me, it is the right cheese that really makes this dish.",
