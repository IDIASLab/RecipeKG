I also added two chopped carrots and stalks of celery that I had on hand. Next time I d probably add in some chicken bouillon or seasoning salt as the broth by itself was fairly bland (though I m sure the seasoning on a rotisserie chicken would also help enhance the flavor compared to the turkey I utilized). Will definitely be making again.",

The only additions I made were to add 2 sliced carrots and some chicken boullion because we like our broth to taste a little richer than basic canned broth. I also needed to add an extra can of broth probably because of the carrots that I added and the extra 2 oz. of tortellini in the package I bought. We will be adding this delicious soup to our winter rotation for sure! Thank you for sharing!",
