You're really just combining ingredients. You can also experiment with adding other ingredients, like mushrooms or veggies.  Anything that needs to be cooked can probably be added at the chicken stage. I did not add any onions or garlic, because the pesto I used already had both, but if your pesto does not, you can add those with the oil as well.",
