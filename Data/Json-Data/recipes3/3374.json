The green chilies with the tomatoes that it calls for really add a punch and in leftovers the heat factor is somehow intensified maybe even overpowering. I would definitely make it again more than likely however without the green chilies and perhaps substituting with shrimp. Though this recipe tastes great with the crawfish processing them was a little time consuming. Shrimp would work better if you were in a rush.",

Yes I didn't have enough crawfish so I added shrimp probably 1 1/2 or close to 2 lbs. total and I believe for all it makes you need that much. I used 1 can cream of shrimp and 1 can cream of mushroom (2 cans is plenty). I used 2 tbsp. fresh parsley. Didn't need any salt or pepper added. Served over brown rice.
