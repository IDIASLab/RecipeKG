The recipe did not specify to remove the seeds from the jalapenos or the chipotle's and I think at least one of the peppers need that if not both. I like spicy but it was far too much for me and completely overpowered and ruined the dish. If you like your chili spoon stand up in the bowl thick you will either need to cut back on the broth or use quite a bit of masa harina as the submitter noted. What I will say is that if I could have gotten past the heat this would have had excellent flavor. The Shiner Bock tequila and steak sauce came together nicely and made the beef super tender. So much in fact that I do plan on making this recipe again but you can bet I will be seeding the peppers.",

The corn I had on hand was just regular canned corn not Mexican style. Also the tri tip o used was already cooked left over from a previous meal and the inspiration for trying this recipe! Everything else I did as-written. The recipe turned out great! The entire family enjoyed it. It is a bit spicy but we like spice. I served it with grated cheese and sour cream for garnish and corn bread on the side. We will definitely make this again! The only thing I think I might change is to cut back on the steak sauce just a bit. The flavor dominated somewhat; I think slightly less might provide better balance.",

Went to 1 1/2 tablespoons of chili powder 1 chipotle pepper and 1/2 jalape\u00f1o(seeded). This is a good option for those who like spice but also want to taste the chili. Also I added tri-tip that I had previously smoked the day before so it did not need cooking. Really nice but I am sure it is equally delicious the way the recipe states to cook it.

Rather than cube it I sliced it into tiny thin pieces that would cook thoroughly and become tender and delicious. I used the bacon drippings to brown my beef and added a little olive oil to saute onions and garlic. I made the chili somewhat spicier by adding additional chili powder and cayenne pepper. As I said I used this recipe as a pallet and added to it to suit the taste I knew my family would like. I have made it straight by the recipe and it is excellent but go ahead add you on touches and make it yours.",
