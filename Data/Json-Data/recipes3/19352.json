I made the pretzels using pretzel rods, put them in a vase with a ribbon around it, and it looked so pretty.  \n\nA few suggestions: \n1) Be sure to use semi-sweet chocolate (I think). I used Trader Joe's milk chocolate chips and it didn't melt! I then used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips and had no problem.\n\n2) I don't suggest putting the chocolate in a glass beacause it was too think on the pretzels. Instead, I used a wooden spoon and spread the chocolate on each pretzel rod.\n \n3) If you use toppings, be sure to sue VERY small pieces. I found that nut topping, sprinkles, and smashed peppermint worked the best. I tried using heath bar and mini-chocolate chips and they were too big.\n\n4) Finally, if you do use topping, I would spoon it on instead of turning the rod in a pile of chocolate. When I rolled it in the nuts, sprinkles, etc the chocolate fell off and chunked up the mixture.\n\nOverall, a great idea!",

I add a small amount (1-2 tsp) of shortening to the white chocolate when melting it - this helps to thin it a little bit and make it a little easier to work with, as well as to help with the melting problem.  Dip the pretzels, put on wax paper-covered baking sheet and pop it in the freezer to harden.  They won't melt at room temp!  Enjoy this delicious recipe!",

I melted the chocolate along with 1 Tbsp. of shortening in the microwave for 1 minute and then stirred until smooth. The shortening keeps the chocolate smooth and it won't stick to the bowl. Then I sprinkled them with crushed candy cane and drizzled a little semi-sweet chocolate over the top. Not only are they delicious but they look beautiful! Next time I'll double the amount of chocolate so I can make more pretzels. :)",
