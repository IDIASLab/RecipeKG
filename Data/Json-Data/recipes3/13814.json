I have also lowered the temperature to 400\u00b0 and started the sweet potato and sausage, giving them a head start before adding the apple. If you don't, I assure you that the apple will be cooked to mush when the sweet potatoes are finally ready. [And to be precise, I also use yams instead of sweet potatoes]. I add the apple when the yams yield to a fork and are within approximately 15 minutes of being done. I like my yams to be soft while allowing the apple to retain a little firmness, and since the apple is softer it takes much less time to cook. I also vary the seasoning, using McCormick's Greek seasoning. Although not what one might not consider a breakfast dish, I have served this to company,  with many compliments, for breakfast, lunch and dinner and feel that it makes this adaption easily. With the changes I've mentioned, I would give this between a 4 and 5 star rating.",
