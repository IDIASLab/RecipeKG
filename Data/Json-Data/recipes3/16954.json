Used non-fat cream cheese and think it was the big problem as it did not solidify with the marshmallow fluff upon refrigeration. Also I don't think the orange concentrate is needed or at least reduce the amount to half. If i did it again i would add a little brown sugar to the pumpkin instead of the maple syrup.",

As another reviewer commented you will have more of the pumpkin mixture than the marshmallow creme mixture so keep that in mind when layering as they are not equal in volume. These were good but honestly I expected more. The pumpkin layer in particular just tasted like a soft pumpkin pie filling to me; I could not taste the OJ concentrate in either layer. In spite of that they were eaten enjoyed the presentation is nice and they are easy to prepare. So considering all that the recipe at least deserves 4 stars.",
