The recipe submitter said you could use oil instead of lard and also to feel free to substitute any veggies you preferred. Well I did use oil instead of lard and I did not substitute any veggies but just added some. Half of a cucumber wasn't enough veggie for 2 cups of rice in my opinion. I had an open can of shiitake mushrooms and a handful of frozen carrot/pea mix and that is what went in. I think the only issue I have with this recipe is the MSG. I refuse to use it. My 2 cups of leftover cooked rice was made from another recipe on this site which called for a bunch of soy sauce so I had plenty of flavor without the MSG. But without all the soy or MSG this recipe would be very bland. I am giving this 3 stars for the cucumber. I never would have added it and it actually works well.",
