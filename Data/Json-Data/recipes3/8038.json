I am not a fan of canned soup so I omitted that and used a cup of cream mixed with a TBSP cornstarch. I added less milk than was called for as I do like it thicker than most. I served with https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7146/cheddar-bay-biscuits/ Those are a big hit in my family as it reminds us of the biscuits at red lobster.",
