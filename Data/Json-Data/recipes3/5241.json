My advice to anyone who makes it make sure you use balsamic vinegar at the end (it's not optional!) otherwise this will be a very bland dish. I skipped over the balsamic vinegar for the first bite thought it was boring then added it in and it transformed the dish and rocketed it from 3 stars to 5. This also tastes great with baked zucchini chips on the side.",

I loved the little spark the red pepper flakes added but it was a little too hot for hubby's sensitive innards so be careful with children or those who can't tolerate any \"heat.\" And I didn't even use as much as the recipe called for! Because this is such a fresh and colorful dish I thought it would be better suited with fresh basil and I used halved grape tomatoes for additional color and texture. I went heavier on the garlic about one clove for the recipe scaled to two servings. I served this with a rather robust chicken dish so the fact this was light on any additional spices or herbs made this the perfect accompaniment. I think what I like best about this is that it's just so darn pretty on the plate!",

The cheese adds a delicious creaminess; the tomatoes provide a refreshing tang; the pine nuts give a wonderful fragrance; the orzo and wilted spinach in spices serve as a nice base. And it's quite pretty. One nice feature of the recipe is that the main ingredients are prepared separately so each person can mix them to his or her own preference. (I like more spinach (50% more) and much more tomatoes (100% more) and less cheese (33% less).) Some changes: I used half the olive oil and 2/3rds the butter.",
