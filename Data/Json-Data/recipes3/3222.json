Here's what I did: Sauteed the chicken in olive oil with an onion and two crushed up bay leaves. In another pan sauteed in olive oil 2 shredded carrots and 4 medium-sized shredded potatoes plus two stalks of celery. I added a little rosemary and some dried minced onion while the veggies were cooking. After both pans were finished cooking I combined them and added black pepper and 1 cup of chicken broth and two more bay leaves. A pre-fab pie crust from the refrigerated aisle finished up this easy dish. One last note: The pie took over an hour to bake fully but was perfect in the end. Can't wait to share this one!",
