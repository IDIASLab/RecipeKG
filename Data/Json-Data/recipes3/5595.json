Loved the fresh veggies and the only change I made was to toss in a few shakes of Italian seasoning and use fat free sour cream as opposed to cream since to me it adds a lot of flavor. And I decreased the oil by a lot - don't think there is a need for a full 1/2 cup! Nice and simple will use again. Thanks.",

And I didn't have any canned tomatos so I chopped 2 small ones and put it in the food processor. Had I had the correct ingredients this would have been little time consuming to make. I also used only 1/4 cup olive oil and half & half in an attempt to reduce calories. Because I didn't use heavy cream it didn't get as thick as it was supposed to but the fresh veggies really stood out. It could still use a little tweaking to make it an awesome dish but it definitely has the potential.",
