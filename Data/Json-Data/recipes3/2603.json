While crispy coating and crunchy texture is awesome on fried chicken fried green tomatoes are best with a lighter batter and a slight softness in my opinion.:o) This recipe provides that perfectly. In following my own mom and grandma I use part butter and part canola oil when frying... the butter adds a nice flavor. Just be careful not to burn! Once our tomatoes are coated and in the pan we also sprinkled with a little white sugar. Flipping to spirnkle both sides. You could do this from the flour stage; mix it in but I do what I have seen done before me. The end result is a soft fried texture with these bits of carmelized sugar that just play perfectly with the slight tartness of the green tomato. Love them!! Thanks for sharing your recipe and letting folks know cornmeal isn't the only way to an awesome fried green tomato!!",
