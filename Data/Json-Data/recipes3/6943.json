                "reviewBody": "OMG this is one awesome salad! I love tomato bread salads but grilling it is genious and gives everything a smoky flavor that's \"to die for\". I mixed my olive oil with a bit of garlic salt and Italian seasoning. I brushed that over the red onion and plum tomatoes. My bread was already stale (which I highly recommend vs. using fresh). Instead of cubing it and skewering it I cut it in half lengthwise and brushed it with the olive oil mixture and placed it directly on the grill. Not only does it work with the salad but it makes one heck of a delicious garlic bread! I left out the cucumber as I didn't feel it really belong. To assemble the salad I didn't really chop anything I just layered the ingredients and whisked the red wine vinegar with the olive oil and drizzled that over top. Then sprinkled the finished product with chopped fresh basil and some shredded Parmesan cheese. Next time I think I'll add some fresh mozzarella cheese to take this over the top! This makes a fabulous appetizer or side dish. I could have made a meal out of this all by itself - perfect with a glass of wine! Thanks for a great recipe!",
