My pumpin was pre-cooked so I fried the onion in a pan with olive oil (instead of butter) spread it out ontop of the pumpkin and then poured the cheese mix on top and baked for 20 minutes. I had a bit less than the 3/4 cup of ricotta so used parmesan to make up the difference. It was not runny (I was worried as another poster made that comment) at all (I'd already considered trying it with bread crumbs next time but don't need to). It had a nice flavour but next time I'll cut the pumpkin pieces smaller. Mine were about 1.5\" square and that was definitely too big. It looks much nicer than the picture by the way.",
