I've found that the standard one has too many grape tomatoes which make the hummus too runny and give it a too-strong tomato taste. For this recipe I only would use five or six grape tomatoes -- with most of the juice squeezed out. Also I've experimented with roasting the garlic and using more of it with good results.",

The result was a scrumptious soup delicious cold or warmed up. The only problem was I really wanted a hummus consistency as I planned to stuff hard boiled egg whites with it (like a deviled egg only with this hummus). I'm fairly certain that even if I'd left out the liquid from the cannellini beans can it still would have been too runny to call hummus. Kristin? Would you be so kind as to re-read what you put down here in your recipe to verify it's correct? As I said the flavor combination is wonderful! - Thanks!",

It's texture and flavor over powers the hummus. I think I would try it with a different herb. Definitely not something you could use as a dip or on crackers. I gave it 2 stars only because I hope that I can use it on turkey wraps. Will not make again!",

Anyway with that former dip being a fav I thought this dip with its addition of cheese would be a new favorite dip. Made as per recipe and didn't want to ask anyone to eat it. To make it palatable I personally had to add a small dose of white vinegar then a tad more garlic. However in my family's opinion even with those changes this simply was not as good as my former fav. We ate a couple of meals with this and simply had 'thank you' helpings. So I was going to throw this out. HOWEVER MY HUSBAND TRIED THIS WITH CHIPS AND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER. HE STILL PREFERS THE GARLIC-WHITE-BEAN TEX-MEX STYLE DIP BUT CAN TOLERATE THIS WITH CHIPS. (I'll leave the rest to him and the kids though and pass on making this again. Thanks for the idea though. It was fun trying it it inspired a potential dip to our favorite dip and now I'll know more what we do and do not prefer in our home.)",
