I chopped portobello mushrooms into good sized pieces and the flavor was delicious.  I'll definitely make again.  It's hard to believe that this was so quick.",

Once ready to serve - I added some cooked crumbled bacon and sprinkled some cheese over each bowl.  Served with french bread on the side.  Awesome and easy meal with simple ingrediants.  A keeper recipe for sure!!",
