                "reviewBody": "8.28.20  This is really quick and easy to make if you cook your potatoes the night before (or in the morning) and refrigerate.  I had doubts about cooking this at 450\u00baF, but that timing was just about spot on.  It was starting to brown and bubble at 18 minutes, so I took it out of the oven.  Pretty good, just a bit on the dry side, but that wasn\u2019t a major issue.  The sour cream flavor overpowers the cheese a bit, and if I make this again, I\u2019d probably cut the sour cream  back a bit  and add a little milk to get a creamier texture.  As instructed, once the cheese-butter mixture was done, I removed the pan from the heat to add the sour cream and onions.  The sour cream was cold and then the cheese mixture seized up, simply wouldn\u2019t incorporate, so I just put it all back on the heat for a minute or so allowing the cheese to melt.  Be gentle when folding in those cooked potatoes, otherwise,  you\u2019ll end up with mashed potatoes.  IMO this really does need salt and pepper.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
