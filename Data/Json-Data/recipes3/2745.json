The onion garlic and parsley are odd pairings for a milk gravy; so in my second try I left these out and added 1/4 teaspoon ground sage and a dash or two of fine ground white pepper to boost the sausage flavor. No salt necessary; guests should be allowed to salt according to taste. My personal preferance for sausage is Jimmy Dean Regular flavor in the bulk roll. It works best for sausage gravy.",

I didn't have sausage in the frig but I did have some kielbasa.If you are a fan of biscuits and gravy I recomend giving this one a try... It's a quick easy and VERY tasty breakfast. It's my new favorite gravy recipe! However this recipe as written says it will serve four people... It is perhaps enough for two. I ate it all myself!",

When the sausage is almost ready I pour the milk mixture in and bring to a boil. I serve this over the garlic bread. This has now become the most requested breakfast item in my home with even a die-hard vegetarian hartily eating it!!",

I'm not sure but it might also be the first time I've ever made gravy from scratch. I made it exactly as written using a white onion exactly 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1 cup of milk. I also shook on some salt and ground white pepper but the results tasted a little too salty/peppery; maybe the sausage already had these ingredients so I'd omit them next time. One thing I definitely noticed was that the gravy thickened up very quickly and was not very liquid at all; that's why so many reviewers have said that more milk is needed. Still I had this for 2 consecutive breakfasts served over a package of ready-to-bake refrigerated homestyle biscuits and enjoyed it a lot. I'll probably make this again soon and I do recommend the recipe. Thanks.",
