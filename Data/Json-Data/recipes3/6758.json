I butterflied according to these directions, and it came out perfect.  I grilled the chicken skin side up, on indirect heat for an hour at 300 degrees.  I am watching calories so I slipped some sliced garlic under the skin, sprinkled with some lemon pepper and lime juice and threw it on the hot grill.  Don't be intimidated by the butterflying technique.  It will change the way you grill chicken!!",
