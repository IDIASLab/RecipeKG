I made a pasta salad with mayo/yogurt based dressing and put that in the bottom of a glass bowl then layered on diced peppers, grated carrots, diced celery, diced tomatoes ( I\u2019ll use grape tomatoes next time ) then cubed sharp cheddar. I topped it with 17 devilled egg halves and sliced green onions. I dusted the eggs with paprika. \nIt was a  very, very, very impressive looking salad when it was all done. Took a good amount of time to make but definitely worth the effort. I thought it was delicious and so did my family. I will make it again and probably change up the ingredients and presentation for fun.",

I brushed the fish with olive oil and a flavored vinegar (almost any would be good) and salt and pepper and baked in the toaster oven for about 5 minutes until 145 degrees was reached. Other than that, my family does not eat bacon; instead I used cheddar cheese shreds, which was so pretty! My only criticism is that it is very difficult to get down to the bottom of the trifle bowl, to the lettuce. Next time I make this, I will halve the layers and make it in double layers (repeat the layers) except for the eggs. It was beautiful, delicious, filling, and a wonderful one-dish company meal. I served it with fresh bread from my bread machine.",

That and my method of making hard boiled eggs were the only revisions I made to the recipe.  Concerning hard boiled eggs here\u2019s a tidbit of information for all you hard-boiled eggers out there. Whenever you need hard boiled eggs for any old recipe, do not boil them. Simply place the eggs in a little water (if you have a steam basket, use it....if not, no problem just use about 1/2 inch of water In the pot). Once the water is boiling, cover the pot and turn down the heat. You want to keep it boiling/steaming but don\u2019t let all the water evaporate. Steam the eggs for 15 minutes. Cool the eggs any way you like. You will not believe how easily those eggs will peel after steaming.....makes no difference if they are day old, fresh eggs or not! I just wish I\u2019d have learned this wonderful tip earlier in my life! Try it, you won\u2019t believe it!! You\u2019re welcome!!",
