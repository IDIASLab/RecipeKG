Instead of spreading all over the place, these cookies should be rather cake-like, and they shouldn't spread much at all. I then looked at the recipe, and realized there's a typo - YOU NEED TO USE 2 1/4 CUPS OF WHITE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR, NOT 1 CUP!! I have no idea how this typo crept in - I can't imagine that I would have submitted it that way, but who knows? Maybe I did. I'll try to get the site to fix it. Thanks!",

Because of dietary restrictions related to my son's asthma we do not use dairy or sugar in our house and these cookies were an amazing start towards a dessert we can all enjoy. To make them work for us I omitted the butter and dry milk replacing them with a combination of 2 cups of milled flax seed and a half a cup of soy milk. I also replaced the chocolate chips with unsweetened carob chips. Obviously that is A LOT of changes from a traditional cookie recipe so I was shocked when I was able to bring them to a lunch play-date and the other kids actually ate them! Thank-you it means so much to my son to be able to share with other kids. They are already on high request at our house and I think that we will be making them to have on hand.",

By and large, it's a fairly easy transition, but a good cookie -- that's hard to find!\nThese have excellent flavor, and are as easy to make as regular chocolate chip cookies.  The batter consistency is considerably softer than traditional choc chip batter, and has a wicked aftertaste - don't worry, it doesn't come through in the cookie!  They have a different but not bad texture that is halfway between a cookie and a muffin top.  We've taken to calling them muffkies.  These are not going to satisfy any cravings for chewy, dense, Mrs. Fields style cookies; but they are a nice sweet treat for kiddos if you're trying to amp up the nutrition.  I probably won't make these again for a while -- I'm going to try experiments with raw sugars and crystalline fructose to get a \"cookier\" cookie.  ",
