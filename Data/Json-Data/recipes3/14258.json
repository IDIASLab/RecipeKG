My grandma has made this recipe for 50 years that I know of and it is truly my favorite. Serve over noodles. For a wintertime comfort food this is the best. I actually like it so much that my wife and I will have this for dinner and the next morning we will eat the leftovers with a couple of eggs on the side for brunch. You can't beat it!",

I enjoyed making it, and while it is a bit labor intensive, it is still a relatively quick and deeply satisfying meal. Next time around I will start by adding a Half Cup of Sour Cream and adjust from there.  I feel that one cup of sour cream covered up some of the great flavors that were building through the process.

Finally as an adult and a father I had my 8 year old (two nights before her 9th birthday) make this recipe with me and my own grandmother. It was helpful to have my grandmother present while making the gravy because I d seen her make various gravies in the past but never done one myself. We almost lost it but her help saved us. That part is VERY time-sensitive. Overall it was good but I must say that it wasn t a best ever recipe. I ll need to play with it in the future to make it stand out more. All four kids were OK with it (one basically just ate the steak). Definitely a recipe to try again but as a base with modifications performed.",
