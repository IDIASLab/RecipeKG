I have always made my own gravy from pan drippings, and have never cared for the taste of canned gravies.  I figured maybe this one would turn out a bit different due to the other ingredients, but the packaged gravy taste came through quite strongly.  Also, the apple juice added an odd flavor component.  What would be better is to poke a few holes into your roast, pour over 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar to tenderize and throw it in the slow cooker. It's a similar meat flavor (but better) without using all the other high sodium ingredients, and then you can make your own gravy with the liquids from the meat with a little corn starch or flour.",
