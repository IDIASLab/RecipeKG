The second time, I found I didn't have any canned tomatos, but I had a few roma's , so I diced those up and added a little tomato sauce. It still turned out perfect. Every one at my house loves it either way. I sometimes add a little Creole seasoning for a little extra kick. This is one of those recipes that's just real hard to goof up.

I made a few modifications: used a full green pepper; omitted the celery; for the can of tomatoes I used \"Hunt's Diced Tomatoes with Green Pepper Celery and Onion\". I mixed up my own Cajun-type seasoning: 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour 1 tsp season-all 3/4 tsp garlic salt 1/2 tsp paprika 1/4 tsp pepper and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. I stirred this into the mixture in place of the \"salt and pepper to taste\". This was wonderfully hearty and I will make it again. Thanks Gwynn!",

I don't like celery so I omitted the celery and used 1 bell pepper instead. Also I added some garlic powder paprika and a small amount of cayenne pepper. I used canola oil for sauteeing instead of bacon grease (I omitted the bacon altogether to make it more healthy). The result was very yummy! And we didn't have a problem with the \"slime\" normally associated with okra -- maybe sauteeing the okra took care of this. I will definitely make this again.",

I cut them fresh from the garden and did the receipe pretty much just as it is written except for adding some creole spice and jalepenos for heat. It was fantastic I can't wait to make it again.
