I cooked the onion curry apple paprika butter and chicken all together and seasoned it with salt and pepper. Once the chicken was nearly done i added some sweet green peas the soup milk (instead of thick cream) and a bit of water. I let this cook on medium for some time to reduce the liquid and let it thicken. It turned out absolutely delicious and i served it over penne. My husband and 4 year old thought it was great. Probably was alot more difficult than in the microwave....but i wanted the meat to be browned. I will make this again.",

Of course it wasn't as rich tasting then so I stirred in a couple of tablespoons of mango chutney which changed the flavor but I liked it as well. I think this might be one of those recipes that can be altered with what you have on hand and still be delicious!",

The curry flavor isn't too strong like in some dishes and the mushroom and apples are a wonderful complement to it. Thanks Lucille!",

I followed most of the recipe for 1 serving except for using 1% milk & fat free sour cream since that's what I had on hand. I will try this next on the stovetop; I think sauteeing the onion & browning the chicken will add even more flavor. Oh & I cut up some green grapes at the end! Added 1/23/10: I made it on the stovetop - delicious! I followed some of the comments: sauteed onion in butter browned the chicken with curry S & P then added the apple plus celery a handful of chopped broccoli & peas (both frozen) with soup and a random mixture of half/half milk water. Let it simmer to cook the rest of way ( 20 more min.) & thicken. Served over couscous. We loved it! Next time I'll add cubed potatoes.",
