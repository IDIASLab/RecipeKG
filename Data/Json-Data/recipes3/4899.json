These baked up with a nice coating that was pretty crispy even without the extra olive oil. The lemon and garlic on top is a nice addition.

(Would not, could not, use tilapia either) That said\u2026this was so good it was memorable.  The sauce, in my mind, was exceptionally delicious, the ideal complement for the crispy, delicately flavored fish.  I did incorporate my own tweaks \u2013 extra capers in the sauce, and Panko crumbs rather than Melba toast \u2013 not that I necessarily have anything against Melba toast.  More important than the type of crumbs used, I moistened them with olive oil, then added the minced garlic and fresh, chopped parsley. I just placed this atop the halibut rather than rolling the filet entirely in the crumbs.  I think all of this ensured they were extra super crispy and I don\u2019t think using essentially half as much crumbs was any sacrifice at all.  I served this with simple pasta with Parmesan and garlic and oven roasted asparagus.  This meal, this fish, was absolutely, positively exquisite.",
