I enjoyed the flavor as well and was surprised as it's so easy to make! I made one change: I browned the chicken before baking it with the sauce. I think that was better. Will keep and use again for sure!",

Very yummy and the house smells so incredible while it's in the oven. Thanks for a wonderful family favorite",
