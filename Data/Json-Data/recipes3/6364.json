The recipe is fairly accurate but for those who are having difficulty with balls falling apart...you need to add another egg to the batch. Always do a test by droping one or two balls into boiling water before finishing the batch. If the ball floats and does not break apart...take it out and break it with a fork. If it tastes too gummy...add more crumbs to the mixture. If it breaks...add another egg. That's what Grandma taught us!! Also use very thin spaghetti or fermacelli noodles for best results in replicating original egg noodles for the soup. Chicken stock works great! And season with a dash of Allspice when serving. Enjoy!!!",
