I'll never make another green bean casserole than this one again -- and liked it so well, I'll probably make it for several parties. WOW!  Neither I nor my family could believe that GB casserole could be so easy and deliecious. Used 2 drained cans of french cut beans, went with vermouth, didn't add any salt, and didn't measure fried onions.  Also used about 2:1 chopped onions to red peppers.  Next time I may throw fresh shrooms into the saute, too, but just 'cause I love them, not need them.  AWSOME RECIPE!!! Thanks for it!",

I didn't have red bell pepper, so just used 1/2 of large onion.  I didn't use soy sauce, however, used 1-2 tsps of dry mustard (Note dry mustard is not wet mustard. They are two different animals), garlic powder to taste and two shakes of worcestershire sauce and black pepper to taste. I also didn't use butter and cheese.  I didn't think it needed butter and the sauce tasted great without it. Everyone loved it!",
