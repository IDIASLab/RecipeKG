Mine looked much more appetizing than the picture. I did make it in a 9 x 17 glass casserole (more closely as specified in the recipe rather than the small round dish in the picture.) I also believe that to review a recipe you should actually adhear to the recipe. The only differences I made were I only had lactaid on hand....perhaps this accounted for some of the lack of richness in the final product. Also I used frozen peas. So it was nice and gorgeous and had great texture but still a tad bland. So next time think rather than the two cans of soup will probably make my own cream sauce....add paprika and some other spices. So before you think I'm being negative....I think it really good as is......I'm just not big on using canned soups/prepared products etc. Think with a few homemade touches could be a real signature dish. Thank you for the recipe.",
