My squash was smaller than average so I reduced the ingredients (one can of tomatoes and 2 tbsp oregano). It was my first time trying the microwave method and it was pretty nice. The squash cooked evenly enough and was ready in less than 10 minutes. I used tongs to scrape out the \"spaghetti\" and it was easier, and quicker, than with a fork. Instead of using a casserole dish, I just stuffed the emptied squash shells with the mixture and baked, then even served, in those. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you for sharing.",
