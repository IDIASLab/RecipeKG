This recipe, however, had none of that! Yay! I made it exactly as written, except in place of plain tomato sauce, I used Rao's marinara sauce. The only change I'd suggest is to start checking the doneness at around 45 minutes, as that's when mine was done. The Parmesan gives it a wonderful flavor and the house smelled amazing while it was cooking. Served with mashed cauliflower, it makes a perfect low-carb/keto meal.",
