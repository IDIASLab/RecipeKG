These are also great vegetarian (nix the shrimp and add some blackbeans and/or rice) and also as fish tacos (bake some tilapia and dust it with whatever seasonings you like). The mango salsa is also great alone with your favorite tortilla chips. Be careful with the cilantro-- 1/2 is a good amount as long as it doesn't get packed. The second time I made this the cilantro was wet and so 1/2 cup wound up being about double what I should have added-- just about ruined the whole dish.",

Was a hit with the family!\n\nUpon suggestion from other reviews, I also cut my cilantro portion in half, and was still a strong flavor in the salsa, so I would recommend the same. \n\nAlso, took the advice of marinating in a taco/fajita seasoning instead of honey butter. It just gave it a little more zing to the shrimp, which I wanted. \n\nA great recipe and I suggest anyone try this at least once! Thank you for sharing!",
