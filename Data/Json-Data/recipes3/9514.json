It fell apart when we picked it up so we just ate it with a fork. I do think 2 cups of cheese on top seemed a little too much. The cheese got brown and crusty on top which we loved but it was very difficult to cut through. If you like Mexican cornbread - this would fit the bill. I would suggest just adding the cheese to the cornbread mix though instead of on top. Probably would reduce the amount from 3 cups also to 1-1/2 - 2 cups.",

For true Southern taste fry up some bacon in the skillet beforehand and use it instead of the shortening/oil/butter. Do not leave corn bread in skillet after baking or you will have a crumbly broken mess on your hands. Parchment can be used for easier cleanup/removal from the pan.
