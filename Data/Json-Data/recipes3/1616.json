After trying to mix the ingredients and having it very lumpy, I put my stove on the lowest possible setting and barely warmed the mixture for two minutes or so. I did not want the coconut oil to completely liquefy. It was just enough to turn the mixture into this silky smooth texture. I put the chocolate into silicone muffin pans like others suggested and then added different toppings to several of them.   Slivered almonds, crushed hazelnuts, macadamia nuts (salted for that yummy sweet-salty combo!), coconut /chocolate chips and white chocolate/ raspberry chips.  What an easy way to serve an assortment for guests.   Next time I'll try cranraisins and raisins.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

It is not sweet, more like a 75% cacao chocolate bar. \nI used a silicone mini-muffin mould to shape them. I made a half batch resulting in 10 pieces weighing 27 grams each. After a while in the fridge they harden enough to remove and eat like a chocolate treat or roll into a ball and dust with more cocoa powder like a truffle. Melt in some warm almond milk or freeze. Really, just a great recipe with endless options for use. Thank you for this recipe.",

What happened is that the maple syrup started solidifying  the coconut oil.  After doing this the mixture remained silky and was not off color or separated after cooling.\n\nThis was really tasty, I could taste the maple right away which is a plus for me. It melts very easily between my fingers, I think it needs some coating to hold up better, I will see to find a way to thicken it up. I plan to add coarsely ground nuts next time, finely ground would add a bit of protein.",
