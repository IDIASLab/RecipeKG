                "reviewBody": "This is the cheese sauce I learned to make in Home Ec. class years ago.  Once you learn how to make the white sauce, you can add many things to it for home cooking.  Some things I've learned over the years: 1. you need to cook the flour and butter for a bit so the sauce doesn't have a raw flour taste 2. you have to keep the heat very low, or turn it off, when you add the shredded cheese or it will clump up and separate; once the cheese has been added, do not use high heat  3.you need to shred your cheese from a block of cheese, anything that is pre-shredded has added flour to keep the shredded cheese separate.  It will make your cheese sauce gritty.\nI add different things to the basic sauce to give it different flavors - garlic when melting the butter, or Worcestershire sauce for more flavor, sometimes different mustards.  This is good on any vegetable or potato.  By changing the type of cheese, you get many different sauces.\nGreat recipe!  Thanks Samantha for sharing.",

I also added some minced garlic and onion powder. I used shredded cheddar cheese and it worked out perfectly, no need to use block cheese as others have suggested. Sauce was smooth with no lumps. The key is the temperature through the steps of the recipe - not block cheese versus pre shredded in the bag. Make sure to turn temperature down when cheese is added and stir continuously. Good, basic recipe that everyone should know.",
