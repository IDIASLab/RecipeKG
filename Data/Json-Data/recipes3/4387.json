Place in the refrigerator for at least an hour to allow the sealing to take place - otherwise your butter oozes out and the seal helps keep it in.  After you pull them out of the refrig - roll in buttermilk and I used plain corn flakes.  I agree with the other reviewer - parsely (even dried) in your butter stuffing mixture makes this more traditional, beautiful and palatable.  In addition, I used minced fresh garlic instead of powdered - just my personal preference.",

Then, I also use a little flour after i roll the chicken, when combining this with eggs instead of the buttermilk, it helps to seal the butter inside. I also double rolled the chicken in bread crumbs. Overall this is a fantastic way to eat chicken kiev, I made it for my eastern european grandma who was a professional chef for 40 years, and she knew the difference right away, but even so found it to be very good. Enjoy!",

If you add the rest of the cereal mixture with a little buttermilk/butter they are great to add to each bite of chicken. i call them \"crunchies\". i kinda guesstimated at the amounts of spices, you can figure out how much of what is best for you. i looove garlic and the sweetness of the cereal with it tastes sooo good. Since the honey sweetened flakes seem to be gone try frosted flakes!! It is very good! also I've made this with chicken tenders, melted the butter mixture and injected them instead of rolling around the frozen butter. faster and easier and just as good!",
