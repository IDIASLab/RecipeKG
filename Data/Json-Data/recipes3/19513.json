This cornmeal \"snack\" feeds them and they spit out any sand they have inside in favor of the cornmeal. Learned this trick from Cooking Light.",

First 2 cups of wine is more then needed 1 cup would be plenty. Secondy I would increase the amount of red pepper flakes to 2 teaspoons for a little extra kick. With that said I thought this was real good as is but could have been better. What really blew my mind was the amount of clams it called for.....\"36 small clams in shell\"....to serve 6. Are you serious?? I cooked up 5# of small calms about 150-200 clams and had enough sauce left over for 100 more. Who eats just 6 clams? Anyway....I'm sure I will make this again with the changes I mentioned.",
