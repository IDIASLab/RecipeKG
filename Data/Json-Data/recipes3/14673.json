But then I saw a photo online for what looked like a pie crust-wrapped chicken. Suddenly, I remembered doing something similar in culinary school. Pie crust doesn't insulate the chicken as well, resulting in a seamless fusion of skin and crust. Pictured here garnished with fresh rosemary.",

The pastry could have gone a bit longer, but I was concerned about overcooking the birds.  \nBecause this year is so different, and we wouldn't be celebrating with non-household family members, I decided to do a close-to-but-not-quite-traditional Thanksgiving dinner.  Without meaning to at first, I chose all Chef John recipes.\nPictured: \nWhole Cornish Hen Pie\nBaked Potato Puffs\nMaple Walnut Cranberry Sauce \nFrench Onion Green Bean Casserole\nNot pictured: \nPumpkin Panna Cotta (only non-Chef John part of the meal)\nCJ's Ginger Snaps (the only ones worth eating anymore)\nFlipping amazing Thanksgiving dinner!\n(PS this is stretched a little to fit AR's specifications)",

I also had to use a much larger chicken over 5 pounds. I just added about 20 minutes to cook time. The rectangular pastry dough was actually easier to work with than the round pie dough in the video. I placed the chicken on it diagonally and didn't need to do any cutting and pasting just a little stretching. (To prevent tearing the dough I cut both wings completely off and stuffed them in with vegetables.) And I just used a dry white wine for sauce and did not worry with the sel fleur where it was called for. I tested it with a meat thermometer to ensure it was done. Pressed Rosemary sprigs into the dough as well. Sorry for all the changes Chef John! But your recipes are always wonderful. Thank You!",
