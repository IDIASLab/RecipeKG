                "reviewBody": "I made over 400 Valentine Sandwich cookies for my dessert business clients this year using this recipe.  I personally don't like crisp/cut-out sugar cookies, but everyone went NUTS over these cookies.  My niece has me make them for softball games, parties, etc.--she loves them. After making so many of these, I can offer a few suggestions: (1) refrigerate dough for 2-3 hours (I made over 30 batches of dough & often let it refrigerate overnight). I always put the dough back in the refrigerator between batches. (2) I used 2 tsp of vanilla & eliminated the almond extract. (2) When I rolled out the dough, I used confectioners' sugar (10X) NOT flour--I even re-used previously roll-out dough without any problems.  The confectioners' sugar gives the cookie a little extra flakiness. (3) I sprinkled colored sugar on the cookie with the cut-out section before baking-the colored sugar looks nice with the contrast of the frosting coming through the cut-out. (4) I baked the cookies on Silpat, but parchment would work too. (5)I used a different frosting:  2 cups confectioners' sugar (10X), 3/4 tsp vanilla and 4-6 tbsp half & half or whole milk, plus food coloring.  The frosting was always a big hit. (6) I individually bagged the cookies in cellophane cookie bags & everyone commented on how freshed they stayed.  I will be using this recipe for St. Patrick's with shamrock cookie cutters; green sugar & green frosting!  Thanks for the recipe!",

I've had great success using different flavourings in the icing such as raspberry amaretto irish cream etc. instead of vanilla. I've also used cream instead of water to make the icing. You can be really creative with using different coloured icings and various cookie cutter shapes. Any time I've brought these cookies to a baby shower or wedding shower they have been raved about. Soon I plan on using a palm tree shaped cutter with pina colada flavoured icing for my next beach theme wedding shower. Can't wait to bake again!",

The frosting / sandwiching took a while for me but that's my own doing not the recipe's fault. I second the warning to put space between the cookies if you make them 1/4\" thick because they will poof up and out a bit and will stick together. Strong recommendation is to place dough between parchment paper for rolling and then it's easy to simply cut out the shapes pull off the excess and move the parchment paper onto the cookie sheet.",

                "reviewBody": "I was very dissapointed with this recipe. I followed it exactly and used confectioner's sugar instead of flour to roll it out. The dough was absolutely delectable but the finished cookie didn't have a great taste was very brittle and spread a lot during baking making the cutout tops unusable because the shapes were all messed up and didn't look like hearts anymore at all. I much prefer the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe from this site which I made at Christmas they cut out beautifully and retained their shape while cooking also have a better taste and not such a crispy/brittle texture.",
