I like the combination of ground beef and pork for chili meat but the thing that really makes it unique is the spice blend. Be bold give it a try and you just might find out that you ll enjoy it as much as we did. So glad I tried this recipe it will be made again!",

Couple if things if you don't like the taste of cloves move on. If you don't like a pop of sweetness move on. Like most chillis this tastes best made a day ahead but don't hesitate to make the day of still great. Freezes really well. I like to do leftovers served on spaghetti topped with shredded cheddar Cincinnati style. Don't be afraid of the almonds they add a nice texture to this and the raisin/olive mix gives it a great sweet salty taste. I m not a huge fan of beans so I developed this for only one can but feel free to add another can of black beans. Garbanzos would work too if you want more beanies and a little more fiber. Hope you enjoy! Saveur",
