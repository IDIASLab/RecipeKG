I did cook my chicken breast whole and then cubed.  This was just a little heavy on the O.J. for our personal taste, but that citrus flavor is an important part of what makes this special.  I  drizzled just a little bit of melted butter on the corn flakes but, otherwise, followed the recipe.  And for anybody who buys rotisserie chicken at the store, keep this recipe in mind. There are so many layers of flavor you're gonna' be surprised, and surprised in a good way.   Donna Henderson Hopgood thanks for sharing your recipe, it's a winner!",
