I followed the recipe exact otherwise. My husband and I nommed all through dinner, he even said that dinner was a pleasant surprize. Taste-wise, I compare it to French Onion Soup but on chicken. This would be a great company dinner or comfort food for family. I served this with a browned garlic rice and steamed broccoli. A+! NOTE: I suggest you don't do what I did and not pound out the chicken. You want the thinness and tenderness that pounding/flattening provides. Otherwise, you have a tough though very tasty chicken breast. NOTE: If you want to make this into a sandwich, just cut the chicken into strips after cooking, cook the mushrooms together with a bit of the white wine and butter and assemble the \"filling\" on hoagie buns, broiling briefly with the cheese openfaced. My husband thought this up and this\nis how he prefers this recipe now. I have to say it's a great idea.",

While it was acceptable, I'd call this just average and certainly not a memorable palate pleaser. In addition to its being a rather basic chicken recipe with not much flavor or complexity, I believe that if cooked as directed you'd end up with some TOUGH, basic chicken. Once browned, the chicken needs no more than 20 minutes of additional time in the oven, and that's UNcovered. This chicken is so plain and nondescript that at least you won't offend anyone's tastebuds. I substituted shallots for the onion and added fresh garlic, but neither was enough to wake this up.",

I added more seasonings to the flour such as garlic and onion powders and a shake of Mrs. Dash. Due the the ridiculous price of Gruyere I subbed with Asiago and it was delicious. A splash of fat free half and half to the wine sauce made a nice addition. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that my whole family loved.",
