I always used low sodium soy sauce and cut the amount of salt in half. I let this marinate all day. I put it on the grill with a fresh sprig of rosemary to give it a little smokiness and it was wonderful. I can't wait to experiment with other typically tougher cuts of meat to see what happens.....",
