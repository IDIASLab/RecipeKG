I ve made other shepherd s pie recipes on this site and it seems to me that the ratio of potatoes to meat is off a bit. I didn t think my potatoes were huge but I ended up with a casserole that was about 1/3 meat filling and 2/3 potatoes just too many potatoes for my taste. Typically shepherd s pie is cut into squares for serving. If you want to serve it this way you ll have to let it sit for about 15 minutes after it comes out of the oven to firm up otherwise you ll be spooning it onto a plate or in a bowl. From an eye appeal perspective I didn t care for the orangish potato color from the cheddar (white cheddar would eliminate this) and I didn t think it added much to the flavor. This tasted pretty good but it s simply not my favorite version of this dish so most likely I won t be making this again.",
