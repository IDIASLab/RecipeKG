I followed the recipe exactly as written and...my husband hated it and I tolerated it. The celery flavor was just too strong even with the sour cream and dill. I think it would taste better mixed with a potato or another root vegetable to cut the very strong celery flavor. If you love the flavor of celery you would probably enjoy these. After doing some more searching online there are tons of recipes out there that offer alternative ways to serve this nutrient rich vegetable.",
