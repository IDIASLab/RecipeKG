I added a few ingredients namely a few additional garlic cloves a small handful of minced ginger a can of Rotel tomatoes and some dried basil and oregano. Also instead of using canned black-eyed peas I used dried and pressure cooked them beforehand (took only 10 minutes). Served with avocado slices. What a great way to start out the New Year!",

I like them with but it is great either way. I also choose to use corn tortillas but again that is just a personal choice.
