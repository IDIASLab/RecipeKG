Prep was a snap, let it sit,  then throw in the oven.   Full disclosure, I did NOT have fresh dill so used dry. It was flavorful with a hint of sweetness from the honey and an interesting coriander finish, (a spice I rarely use).  I will definitely try this with fresh dill.  I rarely rate recipes because I use highly rated ones most of the time. Thought I should do my duty here on this one as there were only 2 reviews and this really was good. Thanks for sharing!",
