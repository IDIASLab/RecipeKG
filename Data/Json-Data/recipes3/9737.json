How long to boil some potatoes, how long to boil eggs, etc.  And it is a great side dish that can be amped up with extra spices like onion or garlic powder or some parsley.  A very useful recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "It is good to remember the simple. At the moment, all I had were gold potatoes and parsley so here is my tweaked version of the recipe: I, as someone suggested, used some garlic to add a bit of flavor. I instead boil the potatoes until soft but still firm. Then, I melted the butter in a pan and added one crushed garlic clove (use 2 if cooking for 4) and cooked it until fragant (a few seconds). Last, I added the potatoes to the pan with a tablespoon of the water I used for boiling them. I cooked it until it warmed up a bit turned the stove off and sprinkled fresh parsley. The water thickens a bit the butter so your potatoes have a tiny bit of creamyness. Do not over toss the potatoes because then you will smash them inadvertently. The trick is using minimal tossing with the spoon.",
