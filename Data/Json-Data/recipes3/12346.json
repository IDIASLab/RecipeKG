I made it once as is, and it was so awesome my meat-loving family insisted it go on rotation, even though it was veggie.  Second time I made it, I started playing.  Added strips of red bell pepper, sliced onion.  Both times, I used tomato juice instead of broth, and added a splash of balsamic vinegar and some Italian seasoning in with the oil.  Still excellent.  Would be good with grilled chicken, if you can't live without the meat. Quick, easy, delicious.   I'm making it again tonight!!!",

I cooked the cherry tomatoes, olive oil, garlic mix on the stove top since its the middle of summer right now and running the oven isn't worth it. Came out beautifully and is much quicker. Everyone ate up the dish quickly and my husband was asking for more but my daughter had already cleaned out the serving bowl.",
