It was a bit flatter than I had anticipated-- I might make two next time and have a four layer cake (but then again the cake is dense enough that that might be a bit much). I made this with SPECIAL BUTTERCREAM FROSTING (also on this site) which was soooo yummy! Decorated with fresh strawberries sliced lengthwise and arranged in groups of three to make simple flowers. To make superfine sugar for this recipe put regular sugar in the blender on chop for 30 seconds or so.",

Between the layers I put a mixed berry filling (one bag of Trader Joe's frozen mixed berries thawed and drained thoroughly then run through food processor 1 t vanilla 1 T superfine sugar) and a layer of white chocolate cream cheese frosting (12 oz cream cheese 1 1/2 stick unsalted butter 11 oz white chocolate melted and cooled; blend all three together). Frosted the whole thing and it was the hit of the night (got reviews as good as my Gourmet chocolate cake). The texture was firm but not too dense as other reviewers felt. I think others may have been expecting angel food because of the egg whites but it is far from it. Thanks for a great basic white cake recipe that will work with many frostings and fillings.",
