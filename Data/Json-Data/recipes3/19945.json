We needed a good hearty hot meal to eat with buns during our ski day so I doubled the recipe for our 7qt crockpot. Cooked on high for 5hrs. See 2 photos I contributed for my results from this recipe. I added additional ingredients & adjusted some of the original items (these are for the doubled recipe unless otherwise specified). Added: 2tsp thyme 1 bottle clam juice (236ml) & the reserved 1 3/4cup clam juice from cans) 250g chopped crabmeat 1/2 cup roux to thicken soup (heat on the stove 1/2 cup melted butter & whisking in 1/2 cup flour for less than a min.) I only used 1/2 a carrot total cubed 6 potatoes (1/3\" size) & fried bacon slices first. I then added 1 can condensed cream of mushroom & 1 can condensed cream of potato. As per other reviewers evaporated milk was added at 1.5 hrs left to cook to prevent curdling. Added the clams & crabmeat at this time too. Added roux with 50 min left when it looked too watery to me. My 7yr old is so-so with chowder (doesn't like chewy clams) but she ate up her whole bowl (she liked the crabmeat). Changes for next time not double original clam juice amt therefore add only 1/4 cup roux. My 10yr old & husband also were impressed at the results.",

I did use two cans of clams and I'm glad I did; even with that they seemed a little thin on the ground. I used 4 potatoes which seemed just about right; I used 2 onions rather than measure a cup. My crockpot cooks pretty hot so I added the milk when I added the clams; after 4 hours on high. The milk and clams got about 20 minutes on high 20 minutes on low then we ate. Yum yum yum! One suggestion for a side; Garlic Cheese Quick Bread from this site. I made this for my birthday dinner and was not disappointed! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I did end up making some alterations- adding more clams and potatoes and adding half and half at the end with the clams instead of the evaporated milk. overall great and something I will be making again:)",
