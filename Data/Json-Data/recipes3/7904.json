Yes it is what I call a base recipe and as such it was a perfect base. By itself I could not have served it to my family or to my friends. Here are my changes: First I sauteed chopped onions red bell pepper and celery with the garlic. Second I added Fox Point seasoning (Penzey's miracle for anything vegetables!) at the same time I added the pasta. Finally I baked it but added the breadcrumbs and parsley as another reviewer suggested. It was delicious. I gave it 4 stars because as written it would be fine for a beginner or someone who is not an experienced cook but wants to leave the mac and cheese box behind. Thanks for sharing.",

Also used half sharp cheddar and half Monterey Jack grated as I had both on hand. Used a teaspoon of Frank's hot sauce the rest as per recipe.

I substituted for gluten-free options (almond flour and gluten-free pasta), used oat milk, as well as used fresh veggies (bell peppers, jalepenos, onions, peas) instead of frozen. I also doubled up on the siracha in the sauce, and added hot paprika before baking. Worked out so well, I had thirds! You can definitely add even more siracha/hot sauce, however- it flavors the food, but loses much of its bite in the cheese.",
