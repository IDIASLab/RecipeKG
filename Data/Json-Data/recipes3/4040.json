I did divide this into 2 loafs which make it easier to handle. Subbed broccoli for the green beans (yuck) but that does not affect my rating. Cut way back on sour cream as I wanted to use mozzarella and cheddar. Microwaved potatoes carrots and broccoli to save a step and on dish washing. Will make again but with my adjustments.",
