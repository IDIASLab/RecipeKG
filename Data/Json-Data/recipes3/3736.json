I actually put in hot sauce, very nice kick. \n\n3) If you make it thick enough, it could be used as a dip! Cut up some pita bread, toast the slices, and dip it into the sauce when it's cold.",

I did sautee up some onion with the garlic and basil and I used jarred roasted peppers and added a few extra pieces.  I also used mostly heavy cream with a splash of whole milk for the cream which I also mixed in 2 tsp cornstarch for a thicker sauce.  Spiced it up with some dashes of red pepper flakes, sea salt, pepper, and red paprika.  Using fresh grated cheese makes a big difference in a dish.  Served over fettucini.  Wouldn't it be an idea to brown chicken chunks with the onion/garlic - blend the peppers then pour over the chicken..Let that cook awhile and then add the cream and spices...Throw over pasta and top with some shredded mozzarella cheese and bake til cheese melts...Sounds good huh??\nIt's great to have a decent base recipe to experiment with.",

Tonight however I had some time so I halved and roasted my own peppers in the oven.  MUCH easier than I thought and the skin just comes right off.  For a sweeter sauce, I used one yellow and 2 reds instead of just 2 reds.  On that note, This recipe calls for 2 peppers, but I used 4 large bell peppers (keeping the other measurements the same) and you could taste the peppers much better.  Also at the end while simmering... try adding a few oz's of chopped sundried tomatoes... it adds a nice burst of flavor that is great for pasta, meat or whatever.  Bottom line is this sauce tastes great on everything i've put it on.",

                "reviewBody": "This was excellent! I made half a recipe and roasted the red pepper over the fire on the stove instead of the oven. Then I put it in a sealed bag for about 10 minutes before removing the charred skin. The skin came off with ease. This recipe took quite a bit of time but it was well worth the time and effort. Next time I might make one big batch of the red pepper basil and garlic puree and freeze it. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",

It was beyond bland but some of the flavors that it did have just clashed horribly. After tasting it I tried to rescue it but to no avail. It ALL went down the garbage disposal. What a waste. The consistency was horrid.",
