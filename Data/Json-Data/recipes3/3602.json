Then prepared it two slightly different \"open faced\" ways for a meal (eliminating about 150 calories per serving by skipping the French bread AND the second slice.) First I used a thick piece of Texas garlic toast topped it with a nice layer of shrimp and crab spread wrapped it in tinfoil and baked as directed. Darn good. For the next day's lunch I just put the seafood spread on a regular slice of toast put paprika and pepper and parmesan on top then put it under the broiler. Also darn good! Thanks for a great recipe ME WYNTR and thanks to a national drugstore chain for having the canned crabmeat and shrimp on special this week!",

I went with swiss cheese over mozza and split ciabatta buns baking them open face for about 15 minutes in the oven. I also grated a bit of fresh parmesan over top before putting them in the oven. I think next time I would chop up a generous amount of fresh parsley to add to the spread for the added boost of flavor and color.",
