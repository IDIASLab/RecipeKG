I cooked noodles according to directions set aside. Sauteed all veggies on olive oil mixed with butter add flour and milk salt pepper spices and parmesan cheese. mixed veggies with noodles add basil. put everything in casserole dish sprinkled with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and put in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
