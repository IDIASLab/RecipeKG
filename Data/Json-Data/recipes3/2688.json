I liked Tobasco on it. It is salty...a big reason why the 4 kids loved it! I made for lunch with bread and crackers. Next time I will use homemade bread crumbs because my commercial stuff had a lot of sodium and go easy on the salt and switch to garlic powder. Great for using up Easter eggs! Could easily increase egg count. The celery gave a nice needed crunch. Be good on party toasts.",
