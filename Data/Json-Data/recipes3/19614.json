Thankfully, the good folks at allrecipes.com make it so I can rely on other cooks' experience and suggestions to make sure that doesn't happen again.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the reviews, I doubled everything except the Worcestershire for the 2 1/2 cups of seeds I had, substituting seasoned salt for regular salt, and baked them at 300 for an hour, plus 8 more minutes for that extra crunch. I did use Parkay butter spray and sprinkle on Parmesan for that last 8 minutes. They're the perfect texture and taste. I'm putting this one in my recipe box. Thanks for a great recipe, Carolyn, and thanks to everyone else for their comments that helped me make such a great snack!",
