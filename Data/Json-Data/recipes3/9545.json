Other than cutting back the cayenne I followed the directions to the letter and the dressing emulsified into a paste. I tried thinning it out with more lime juice then it ended up too tart so I added some sugar and then even added a little water to get it to the right dressing consistency. Too much tweaking here. Yes it does have a Southwestern flavor but the cumin ends up dominating (I'd cut that in half) and as mentioned earlier you better like your food REALLY spicy for this recipe. Finally it just doesn t have a whole lot of eye appeal. Sorry just didn t work for us.",
