When I was compiling the soup chicken etc. mixture I was so excited anticipating that the end result was going to be true comfort food. But I felt like I was eating a \"crunch casserole\" instead. If I were EVER to attempt this again I think the fix is to precook almost everthing instead of just the chicken. Even after baking longer than what the recipe called for the celery and onions weren't anywhere near done. Sorry!",
