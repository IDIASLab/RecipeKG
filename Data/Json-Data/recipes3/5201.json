I use reduced fat cream cheese instead of fat-free (I've never found fat-free cheese appealing) and I add a little splash of milk to my food processor because the ingredients are too thick and because I prefer to use the recipe as a creamier dip rather than a spread. I served the feta dip with the Pita Bread Bites from this site. It's one of my favorite appetizers. Yum.",
