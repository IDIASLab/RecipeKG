The first time I used about a half teaspoon of pepper flakes this time I added a whole teaspoon. That's about where I like it. The biggest change we made which I think is the perfect balance is using 1/4 cup sesame oil instead of a half cup. This made room to experience more of the flavor profiles and other agreed.",

(Drained the spaghetti on top of the peas and carrots in a colander to blanch them.) Served as a meal in a bowl! This recipes lends itself to all kinds of additions. It also makes a ton!
