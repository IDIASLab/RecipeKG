I added sauteed red and green peppers along with some onion in a little garlic to get in some veggies. I subbed light shredded Cheddar cheese as I didn't have any Mozzarella on hand and since my husband is a big fan of bacon I added some cooked and crumbled. This is a great base for add-in's like veggies ham sausage or bacon - no matter what it's gonna be delicious. Overall very tasty and a great way to start the day. Perfect with a side of fresh fruit and OJ! Thanks for a great recipe wramirez1209!",

This is to prevent any soggy texture on the pizza and to not only get the hashbrowns nice and brown but to also cook them in bacon grease to add more flavor. I also added half a pound of cooked crisp crumbled bacon. Good quick and easy breakfast. My husband and kids inhaled the whole thing. Next time I would double the recipe to use two cans of crescent rolls and use a different cheese.",

You could add different types of veggies pieces of ham bacon sausage or maybe take it the Mexican route with some salsa jalape\u00f1os chorizo and sour cream. The crescent roll produces a tasty and tender crust which can be eaten just like pizza...with your hands! Today I served with turkey sausage patties fresh fruit and OJ.",
