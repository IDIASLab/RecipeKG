The glaze combines apple juice corn starch and brown sugar. The glaze ensures that your pork chops wont be dry and adds a little more sweetness to the recipe. The only other thing i would add would be to adjust the baking time depending on the thickness of your pork chops. I only baked mine for 25 minutes vs. the 40 minutes it calls for in the recipe.",

The balsamic in this intrigued me. I almost doubled the filling for the 3 huge chops I used. I cooked it covered for about 50 minutes then uncovered for 10....there was still a good bit of juice in the bottom so I cooked it on the stove top to reduce it a bit and added a small squirt of Dijon mustard to it. Served the sauce over the chops and my favorite Brazilian White Rice (Thanks Nanda). WE had a fantastic dinner. My hubby and I both want the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thanks Valerie!",

First off I'm not a pork chops fan which is why I was looking for a different way of making them - after this recipe I now actually crave the things! I followed the directions exactly except I also seasoned the prok chops with a little thyme and I only had a red delicious apple so I used that. It was amazing! I was in a hurry and I had very thick pork chops so I cooked them for 25 minutes at 425 and they were juicy and all the way cooked. Perfect recipe to impress others thanks for sharing this one!",
