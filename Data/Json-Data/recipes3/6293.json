I was hesitant about the cinnamon and I should have go with my gut feelings and omitted it. I like cinammon just not on beans. Ugh Yikes!! As this was cooking I knew I was going to hate it. It smell gross!!. To try to masquerade the cinammon taste I added onion powder garlic cilantro liquid smoke bell pepper and some ham flavored seasoning I had. Still the cinammon taste lingered a bit and it just taste terrible!!! Sorry:(. It sounded really good. Maybe next time if I ever make this again I will omit the cinammon",
