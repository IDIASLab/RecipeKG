I also used 3 hard boiled eggs since we like those and used just a few organic green onions instead of the regular onions.  We were out of regular mayo so I used Miracle Whip.  After tasting it, I also thought it needed a bit of a kick.  So I mixed in about 1/2 tsp. of half sharp paprika from Penzeys.  That did the trick!  Served on croissants.  Everyone loved it and we will be making this every time shrimp goes on sale.",

The recipe is just fine as written, but I used it as a springboard to personalize it to my own tastes.  I added a little extra egg and less carrot.  I used green onion rather than regular onion - it adds color and it doesn't linger with you hours after.  I added some green peas just for fun and I particularly liked that addition.  I cut the mayo half and half with sour cream adding just enough to hold the salad together and make it creamy.  I gave it a squeeze of lemon and a few shakes of dill.  Nutritious, fresh, light, delicious and \"shrimple.\" (I couldn't help myself...)",
