I keep going back for another sliver :) I followed the recipe pretty much and just followed advice to salt & pepper at each step tasting the parts as I made them. Also didnt cook all the liquid out of the mushrooms...kept just a bit...and used a little extra marsala - for a less 'firm' filling. It was great. \n\nAlso - another reviewer mentioned adding a drizzle of honey. I did not add it in the pie but was curious to taste with my slice. HEAVEN. I think I will give the interior a drizzle next time before adding the top pastry. \n\nAddictively delish - Thanks for the recipe!",
