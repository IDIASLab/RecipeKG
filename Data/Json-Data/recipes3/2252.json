I was a bit apprehensive when I saw how thick the mixture got after adding the flour but later realized there was nothing to worry about. This is the absolute best soup I've ever had! I followed the recipe \"as is\" except that I decided to double it since I wanted to use whole veggies (as opposed to 1/4 cups) and had lots of leftover rice from the day before. The recipe does not specify, but I used green apple, which added a fantastic punch to the flavor! This was so delicious and so easy. I can't wait to make it again!",

Delicious thank you for the recipe.",
