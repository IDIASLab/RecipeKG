I started it on the stove top and once the chicken was nice and brown transferred it to a 350 degree oven for about 20-25 minutes----inside temperature was 160. The Mornay sauce was not difficult at all and added that somethin-somethin to the finished product....tasty too! This was recipe #4 that I made from Allrecipes.com and so far every single one out did the other...I don't know how to top this or what to make tomorrow!",
