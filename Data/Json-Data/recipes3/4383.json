This is an easy basic recipe to which you can add seasonings, that I will be bringing to a St Paddy's day party hosted by Irish friends from Dublin: \nSoak dried peas overnight in a large bowl with several cups of water, and 2 tsp. of baking soda. The baking soda is important as that is what makes the peas break down. The next day, drain the peas, add water just to cover, and simmer for 20 mintues. The peas will break up nicely without mashing. Add a little water if needed to bring to the consistency you like. Don't season until the end or it toughens the peas. It's great served with malt vinegar, and you can add mint if desired. ",

Thank you so much for this easy, delicious recipe. I served these with traditional fish and chips... fried cod and fried potato strips.",
