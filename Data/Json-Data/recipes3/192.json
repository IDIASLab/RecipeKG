It made a wonderful spread on slices of french bread. Just bake at 350 until crispy.\n\nI also pre-cooked my mushroom caps so they would become waterlogged once stuffed. Place on cookie sheet with bap side up and brush with olive oil. Roast at 400 degrees for 6-7 min, or until they are golden and liquid begins to seep out. Place cap side up on papertowels and seal in airtight container until ready to use. \n\nPre-cooking does a wonderful job at keeping the mushrooms from becomming watery, gooey messes.",

The second time I omitted the garlic salt and used fresh garlic and salt and pepper. Then a dash of parsley about a Tbsp of mayo 1/4 cup shredded parmesan ALL of the mushroom stems minced up and about 1 Tbsp lemon juice and with all the additions it increases the size of recipe so you need more mushrooms. Now the next time I make it I will try doing just what I said but will omit the parmesan and increase the crab. Nevertheless now its a great recipe!! thanks for the base you offered to start with but definately needs a kick.",

Firstly I used herb and garlic seasoned cream cheese and skipped the garlic salt.

The lemon was the first thing everyone commented on and they all thought it really complemented the other ingredients.",

I used spinach/artichoke flavored cream cheese 2 cans of crab 1/2 c parmesan lemon juice and zest minced garlic salt and pepper and all the stems. I have a lot more filling than mushrooms but that's OK! I also put the filling into a Ziploc bag and cut off a corner to fill the mushrooms this made it really easy. I baked them on a broiler pan since there were several comments about extra liquid and I hate soggy mushrooms. I also pre-cooked the mushrooms like one reviewer suggested. Turned out great and were a hit at the party!",
