I split one sugar pumpkin to use in both recipes. The baking time for this recipe was substantially shorter than the other however it was still longer than described in the recipe. I was afraid that the pumpkin would be dried out because it wasn t covered but it came out beautifully. I preferred using the food processor instead of the blender as I didn t want to dilute the pumpkin and it was much easier. This recipe was the winner.",
