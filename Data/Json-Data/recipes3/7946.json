It is well worth the time it takes to make this one. I made a double batch just because I had over 2lbs of crawfish I needed to use. I only blended about at 1/3rd of crawfish with the tomatoes only because I like big chunks of meat. I also did half heavy cream and half and half. I love it. It did seem to be missing something but I can't put my finger on it. I'm going to add garlic next time to see if that is what is missing(only because I'm a big garlic fan).

I couldn't find fish stock, so I used clam juice I found by the clams and other canned meat. I also used better than bouillon chicken stock for what clam juice I didn't have, and to cut the fishy flavor. I didn't have any brandy, but I did have some scotch on hand (Glenfiddich- the good stuff!), so I used that. I also used red onion instead of a leek. I was hoping to recreate a bisque I LOVE at this fancy seafood restaurant near us. That one is a lobster bisque, but I'm not on a lobster budget, so I went looking for crawfish recipes when I found some tails prepackaged at the store. This recipe was really yummy, and very close to what I wanted! It makes A LOT of bisque, though, and I'm the only one who really wanted/loved it (family isn't big into fish and soups), so I'm sad it won't last forever and I may end up losing some of it. Next time I'll keep that in mind, and will make it for a crowd. I think it would be a hit!",
