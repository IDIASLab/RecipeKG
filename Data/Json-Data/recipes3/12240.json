I think 2 zucchini with 20 ounces of cheese (goat plus the parm) would be overkill. I looked at the recipe submitter's photo on his personal recipe and it shows a sprinkle of parm not a 12 ounce layer... so I used a sprinkle and a little less goat cheese. I used turkey bacon as well. This was a very nice recipe with those modifications.",

I did my search and this recipe came up.  I had to make a few other changes (spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and sliced tomatoes, cream cheese instead of goat cheese.)  The rest I stuck with and also used some colby-jack cheese on top.   All the way around this was a great recipe to work with!  I had no idea that I could boil the sliced squash! So learned something new and it turned out really yummy!  Thanks so much for the recipe!!",
