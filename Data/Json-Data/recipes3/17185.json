        "description": "This gorgeous pumpkin creation will make your step sisters turn green with envy. It's chock full of seasonal veggies and will feed a hungry crowd at any holiday table. The Cinderella pumpkin is a variety that is flattened and deeply ribbed. They usually grow 25 to 30 lbs. Mine was more like ten pounds and it was still wider than a cookie sheet. I think the recipe would be quite doable with several small pumpkins like the sugar ones, for individual servings or for a smaller group. I prepared the veggie filling prior to filling the pumpkin.",

I did make a couple changes used baby bear pumpkins for single serve portions did not use all suggested veggies and forgot to put in the seasonings and it turned out very yummy. I will definatly make this again before the pumpkins are gone for the season and will try different veggies and italian sausage instead of the kiebasa. this will be a halloween tradition from now on as it is very filling perfect before heading out to trick-or-treat.thank you for a fabulous recipe.",

After 3 hours of the filled pumpkin being in the oven I pulled it out to take a look and the flesh was so soft that it cracked and fluid started leaking everywhere. I tested the filling and it wasn't quite cooked:( So I thought nothing for it; scoop it out and cook it some more. I put all the filling back in my big pot and simmered it for an additional 30 minutes or so. After all the filling came out of the pumpkin though it couldn't hold itself up anymore and collapsed completely. I scooped up some flesh and added it to my pot and saved the rest. So next time I don't think I will pre-bake the pumpkin as it seemed unnecessary. I might also try lentils as a good sub for the brown rice. The only other thing I would change about this recipe is to double the meat; each bowl only had about 3 slices in it and my man likes a little more meat than that. But wow! Excellent recipe thanks for sharing!",

(Cooked the pumpkin for 1hour at 400 and 1 hour at 350 then added the filling and continued cooking for 30 min.) The pumpkin was a little charred on the outside and not nearly as pretty as it could have been but it was fully cooked and everything tasted wonderful.",
