Lucky for us, we found a great recipe in this month's issue of Cooking Light that not only provided something light and healthy, but provided proteins (chicken) that we essentially need in order to call it a meal. Here is our spin on this recipe. As with most recipes that we find online or in magazines, we do some tweaking to fit our eating style.",
