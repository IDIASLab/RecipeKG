Sprinkle with fresh ground black pepper and drizzle 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Let the oil soak in until the oven is pre-heated to 350 degrees. Using your finger, spread the oil around the exposed bulbs and the upper part of the skin. On a foil-lined baking sheet, turn the cloves CUT SIDE DOWN and bake for 1 hour. Remove from oven, let cool for 20 or 30 minutes, then serve with crusty bread, goat cheese (or some other good cheese) and kalamata olives. The presentation is beautiful since the cloves of garlic are perfectly carmelized and haven't burned from being face down.",

I do put it on top of a crumbled cup of foil to make sure any excess oil or stuff doesn't fall out.  I normally roast this on 400 degrees when I am making chicken for about 30-45 minutes.  When they are squishy to the touch...I SQUISH them out in a container and keep them separate and just add them to whatever I want. This last time I used a whole bulb and added it to 1/4 cup of a butter substitute and added a little salt put it on the steaks, the bread, and some mushrooms and onions.  It was fantastic! :)  (I put the butter in a zip lock bag, pushed it to the bottom and froze it.)",
