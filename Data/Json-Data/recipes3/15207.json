Instead of that mysterious, gelatinous red sauce that Chinese restaurants use, I filled these buns with regular barbecue pork for a more savory version.

It was actually fun to make and it turned into a really hilarious family event to see who could make the worst shaped bun! We are FAR from professionals in this house so it was really entertaining for us to try and make these look even remotely normal. After we let them sit and after steaming though, they really did look like it was done by someone who knew what they were doing. I changed up the filling and used ground pork with sauteed onions and cabbage, sesame oil and hoisin sauce and it came out great! I will definitely make these again!",
