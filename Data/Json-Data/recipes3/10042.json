Despite those changes, this was fabulous.  I cooked the chicken and then set aside covered with foil, then cooked the remaining ingredients in that pan to capture all the chicken flavor and save on cleaning pans.  At the very end, I placed the chicken in the sauce to finish.  This is delicious.  Thanks for sharing!",

I think it would have tasted better with just the asparagus. We ended up adding the pasta to the sauce to try and soak it up a little. If we make again, would add more flour and leave out the spinach.",
