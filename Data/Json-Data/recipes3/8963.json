Salting both sides of the slices and allowing the cornmeal to sit a few minutes before frying, creates the breading. Fry till just past golden. Honestly they\u2019re good even burnt. My grandma made them. I\u2019m sure her mama did too. My grandma was born in 1918 & I\u2019m 5th generation Gulf Coast Southerner. I can\u2019t remember the 1st time I had the magical tangy warm green tomato with crunchy popcornesque flavored coating! But I\u2019ve eaten hundreds of slices in my 43 yrs. They\u2019re one of my top favorite foods. Try frying them in coconut oil for a tropical fusion delight! I\u2019ve fried them in olive oil, bacon fat and lard too.",

My western grandmother made them the same way except she used flour instead of cornmeal, and she fried all foods in bacon grease and lard, until as a senior citizen in the 1970s, she switched to sometimes using Crisco for fried chicken. Both grandmothers  used bacon grease when they had enough because, since it was left over from other meals, it was free, and it added flavor for free. Both of my grandmothers  and my great- aunts would have scoffed and waved away anyone suggesting more ingredients, more steps, and dipping sauces. I make fried green tomatoes the way they did, except I fry in vegetable oil. Thanks for posting an authentic recipe.",
