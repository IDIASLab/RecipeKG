I increased eggs to 14 used 1 cup milk 1/2 cup half half 3 cups frozen shredded potatoes and about 3 cups shredded sharp cheddar. Instead of ham I cooked a pound of bacon and crumbled it and did not completely drain the grease. I also chopped a green pepper and vidalia onion and lightly sauteed in butter. I think I used about 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I generously buttered the 13 x 9 pan before adding ingredients - I covered and refrigerated overnight. Then took out of refrigerator about 20 minutes before cooking it. Everyone raved about it - I think sauteed mushrooms would also be good as would drained chili peppers. Thanks for posting",

I also used sharp cheddar cheese and added some hot pepper cheese to spice it up.  It's a great basic recipe to start with, and then you can add whatever your family likes.
