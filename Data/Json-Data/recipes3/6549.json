Adding in the garlic first will overcook it. I suggest sauteing the onion and red pepper, then adding in the green onion and garlic in the last couple minutes. I also saw no point in trying to wrestle with the omelet to flip it over. Just cook low and slow until almost set (eggs still a bit shiny), then roll out onto a plate. The residual heat will finish cooking the inside.  I garnished with some extra green onion.",
