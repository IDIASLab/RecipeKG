The cayenne dry marinade was fabulous and cutting the fillets while frozen made for skinny and ultimately crispy finished \"fries.\" I coated in a mixture of fine organic cornmeal fine flour seasoned salt granulated garlic onion powder and a little more cayenne for extra kick. Crunchy delicious and very addictive even for my toddler grandson. Frying catfish may not be \"rocket science\" (to quote a previous reviewer ) but if it were? This recipe made it into orbit for me!
