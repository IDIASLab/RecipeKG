I think the flavors are just a little muddy, and there are no textural contrasts to enjoy. If I were to make this again, I would cut the turmeric in half, add a bit of garam masala, and then garnish with thinly sliced scallion and thin rings of jalapeno peppers. The basic idea is very good, and it reminded me of a mild Bombay Potato dish I had once.",

I replaced the cumin seed with 1/2 tsp of ground cumin and used tomato paste with some chicken stock instead of tomato puree.  Also added some fully cooked meatballs at the end just to warm through, since we're meat eaters.  Served as a main dish for dinner with side \"oriental\" salad.  Overall wonderful use of potatoes and coconut milk.",
