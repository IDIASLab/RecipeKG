The bechamel sauce was great - I plan on incorporating that into our regular lasagna recipe in the future. But the rest reminded us too much of the pre-made lasagna you purchase from the store. I added some cooked ground beef to this (per reviews here) and I'm glad I did else I'm not sure we'd have liked it at all. For the baking dish size I couldn't quit fit in 5 layers (I'm chalking that up to the meat.) The dish seemed like it needed a lot more tomato sauce as well in comparison to how much bechamel sauce there was. I also had to cook it for an additional 20 minutes and believe another 10 wouldn't have hurt it.",

As it stands it is bland and blah. I mean just looking at the photo it doesn't appear to be a 5 star recipe. SO BECAUSE of my changes I felt like I really needed to be honest.
