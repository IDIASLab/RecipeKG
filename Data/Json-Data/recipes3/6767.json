I picture the filling within the cup, baked and topped grated cheese and fresh dill.. thoughts anyone?\n\n**Update**\nSo i made this appetizer and it was sooo yummy. The only thing I would change in the recipe is to reduce the salt some. I used half and half instead as I ran out of milk, and used red bell pepper rather than green, for mor color variation. I also used the frozen phyllo cups and topped with parmesan... beautiful and much easier that working with phyllo sheets. This will be a keeper! As many suggested, this also makes a great pasta dish and/or dip.",

Just use wonton wrappers - so much easier to use and you can find them in just about any grocery store next to packaged herbs. Next time, I think I will use more tobasco and maybe some jalapeno or another kind of chilli or hot sauce, plus a dipping sauce. ",

I also ended up only using half of the 1-pound box of phyllo sheets.  I will make another batch this week.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  It is definitely a keeper!",

Maybe it was just me, but these took much longer to make than the 40 minutes prep time stated...throwing my dinner 90 minutes off schedule!  I would make again, but plan on 1 1/2 to 2 hours total prep time. I found it's easier to gently dab the warm butter on the dough (to avoid ripping) and cover the pastry you are not working on with a warm, damp paper towel (to avoid cracking).  I look forward to more experiments with phyllo dough.  Thanks for the recipe!",

If you played that in school. Also work semi-quickly to get all of the turnovers folded before the dough dries out. I was distracted for the last couple & they didn't turn out so well. You can try damp paper towels to help but I only had some success with that. Overall the recipe was very easy to make the taste was good but not exciting. It seemed to be missing some flavour or something. Everyone said they would eat them again but not their favourites. It did open the door to modifying the recipe with other ingredients or additions though!!!",
