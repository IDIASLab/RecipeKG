While they tasted great and were very rich I'm giving it a 3-star rating because it was not as easy a recipe as it seemed. As I anticipated the truffle mixture did not come out of the heart molds. And the chocolate to dip it in needed to be thinner for better coating. I've seen several other truffle recipes that add vegetable oil to make it easier for dipping. I would suggest adding oil to the chocolate for dipping and not putting the truffle mixture into molds. Great recipe but it needs some modification.",

The soft consistency meant none of the normal tricks (freezing for a few seconds running hot water over the bottom of the pan banging the pan etc.) would work. I'd suggest spraying the mold with some cooking spray before you put the chocolate in the mold or not even using the mold at all and maybe shaping inside cookie cutters. Even though they didn't look too beautiful they sure tasted GREAT!",
