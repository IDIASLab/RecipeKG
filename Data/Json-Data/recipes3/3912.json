I used separate ones for meat zucchini and tomatoes. Seriously try this!",

I let marinate for a few hours and they were good so I gave them a whirl for the party but since I was making so many (for 30 people) I prepared the chicken the day before so the chicken marinated for 24 hours and also added about a tablespoon of minced garlic and that was the key to them being great! Everyone raved about them! Served with lime cilantro rice and four fruit salad from this site and also from this site served Kris's Amazing Shredded Mexican Beef with tortillas and condiments - - - All great items to serve for a fiesta... even got a couple of requests for me to cater graduation parties!
