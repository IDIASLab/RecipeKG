I used a whole wheat pasta which changes the flavor but this is normal for us so I didn't expect it to make that big of a difference. I feel like where this recipe fell flat was using the bottled alfredo sauce. I sampled the dish after step 2 and it was very good and then after step 3 it was only mediocre. My gut tells me that if you make a yummier homemade alfredo sauce it would step up the recipe by at least 1 if not 2 stars. Will try it again sometime.",
