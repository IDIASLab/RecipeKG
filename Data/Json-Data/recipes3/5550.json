They taste as good as any fast food French fries and are healthier. Green bananas are the healthiest because they have all their vitamins where ripe ones lose most of them because they're too ripe.  Green bananas do not have a strong banana flavor at all. It's very deceptive and very healthy. I couldn't stop eating them.",

My partner has not had fries in over a month and so she felt there was no difference in taste other than a mild sweetness. And I do mean mild. Best advice make sure your oil is heated well and also that you place fries in the oil one at a time to avoid sticking. We salted and peppered and they were great and low fat/low cal.",

The tricky part, peeling the unripe (green bananas). Might recommend you do it under running hot/warm water. Watch out for your clothes, the slime will stain them for good.  Cut the tips off, use your knife to cut through the outer skin, use the knife's tip to slowly remove it.   Cut the fries and place in a container that has water and salt, this will prevent them from taking a brown color. When ready to place in the hot oil take out and pat dry.  Unripe bananas are also great to use in soups or simply boiled and served hot, mashed with farmers cheese and some butter. Salt to taste.",
