However, it balances well with the cheeses. This is definitely a keeper that will be going into regular rotation!\n\nRecipe modifications - We omitted the bleu cheese dressing as we aren't a fan of it. Also used regular cream cheese with an extra half teaspoon of garlic powder to compensate, as that is what we had on hand. Our pepper sauce was Siracha. Otherwise, we didn't alter the recipe.\n\nTips - We mixed the sauce first, then cooked the chicken. This allowed us to shred the chicken while the onions cooked. The timing worked much better this way for us!",
