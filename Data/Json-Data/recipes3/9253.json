By time I served them they were somewhere between fries and mashed potatoes. I know for sure that I forgot the step of rinsing the potatoes with cold water after boiling them but I don't know if that is the full reason by they came out so soft as they were already falling apart a little when I drained them. I think next time I will boil for less time and/or cut my fries just a but bigger. I had mine with ketchup.",
