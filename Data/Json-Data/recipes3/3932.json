The sauce was good and it was a shame to waste it; I don't know what you'd eat it over though--maybe rice?",

The salmon was fine but the citrus taste was barely noticeable which was frustrating considering all of the ingredients that went into the dish. Additionally there was a considerable amount of waste...almost 2 liters. While eating this for supper I was wishing that I had just grilled the salmon and saved myself the expense of the lemon grass OJ and white wine. I think that if I were to do this again I would 1/3 of the ingredients and marinate it for an hour or so and then grill it.",
