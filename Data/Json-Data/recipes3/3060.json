I've been trying to clear out perishable food in the house for the last couple of days since I'm leaving town, and this was perfect to use up fresh basil and tomatoes. So much more interesting and flavorful than the plain ol' bagel and cream cheese I was planning on having until I decided to do a little AR recipe investigating.  Simple, yet satisfying and delicious.",
