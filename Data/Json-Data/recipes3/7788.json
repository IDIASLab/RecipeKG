This adds depth to the dish.  \nI sauteed the onion in canola oil, added ginger then (1) 28oz can of chopped tomatoes. Cooked thoroughly. Added beans and used an immersion blender to puree a little bit.  I then added (1) 14oz can of lite coconut milk.  Cooked a little further. Tasted it to check to see if it needed anything.  I added a couple more shakes of garam masala.  Simmered on the stove for another 10 minutes.  Served over rice.  Only giving it 3 stars b/c as written I think it needs some tweaking. Possibly 4 stars with my tweaking. Thanks for sharing !",

After I followed the recipe I didn't like the flavor too much (I felt I could still taste the \"canned\" flavor of the chickpeas) so I added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and some more cumin and curry. I'll admit that the first night it was... ok. The second day it was better and the third day WOW it was great. I really loved the texture that came from putting the tomatoes and onions in the blender. I wasn't sure it would be worth the effort but it actually gave the sauce a nice smoothness that I really enjoyed. I will definitely try it again (with no changes) and see how it goes!",

Instead of blending things I just threw everything in the skillet together so it came out chunkier and less sauce-like. since my spices have been in the cabinet for years i decided to try 3 tsp of cumin seeds and 3 tsp of the curry powder. I had an extra tomato I wanted to get rid of so I threw it in on top of the other 2. It looked a little dry so I added a splash of water. not exactly like you get in a restaurant but the flavor is perfect and this recipe was just what i needed to get a general idea of how to make the dish. i served it over orzo since rice takes forever to cook. hallelujah for quick easy lazy-day recipes!",
