Like other reviewers I added some oregano and basil in addition to the thyme and I used a bit more yogurt to make them very moist. I also ended up using crumbled gorgonzola (a type of blue cheese) instead of the feta which had gone AWOL. (the gorgonzola was great but I'm sure feta would be equally good) Since the burgers were fairly thick we cooked them on low heat on the grill. Served with the Greek Style Potatoes (which were excellent and easy to prepare) and artichokes. YUM!",

When you make the patties, be sure to make each pattie on the thin side, otherwise you'll end up with a gi-normous burger that takes forever to grill.
