We have tons of leftovers!\r\n\r\nI ended up using wide egg noodles as I had them on hand.  I didn't add the additional 2 cups of water because the chicken broth was already watery enough.  It makes me wonder if the gal who posted this recipe intended to put chicken broth granuals or something for all the water that it calls for.  Anyway, I omitted it on my own.\r\n\r\nI suggest using less sherry.  I used Marsala wine and it gave was too much flavor.  I can imagine the same would happen with cooking sherry.  And we omitted the peppers as my husband hates them.\r\n\r\nOverall, we'll have it again.  But will cut the recipe in 1/2, use little or no wine/sherry, no additional water after the broth, and will leave out the peppers.",

Here are the changes I made: Cream of Celery soup (instead of mushroom); left out all water as others suggested; boiled noodles in turkey broth (boiled turkey bones from Thanksgiving and froze broth) and used this broth in recipe; instead of plain salt and pepper added Creole seasoning (seasoned salt); left out sherry; added bread crumbs to top. This had a real depth of flavor probably because the noodles were boiled in broth. Will definitely keep (the modified version of) this recipe in my \"favorites\" cookbook.",

I used Vidalia sweet onion instead of green onions. I used a red bell pepper instead of green. That added nice color to the finished product. We had muscadine red wine so I used that instead of the sherry. Also before I found the worstershire sauce I added a splash of soy sauce. Once I found the worstershire sauce I added about a tablespoon of that. Oh one more change. Instead of adding water I used a whole can of chicken broth. Superb!

I also used one can cream of mushroom soup and one can cream of celery soup. I used 2 tblsp. olive oil and 1 tbsp. butter to sautee the mushrooms onion and pepper in and it was plenty (you don't need all that butter). The dish was coming along just great until I added the chicken broth. It diluted the flavors to the point where I had to add more soup! Definitely avoid adding liquid to this dish. The soups will carry it just fine. I also used low fat cheddar cheese and about 1/4 c. dry sherry. Next time I make this I'll probably make my own \"soups\" to bring the calorie fat and sodium counts down. The celery adds a nice flavor though so if you stay with the recipe as it is (sans liquid) I recommend replacing one can of the mushroom soup with a can of celery soup. The scallions and red pepper also add a unique touch that I prefer over onions and green pepper. This recipe points you in a good direction but it needs refining to make it \"zing\".",
