I also used pecans and mixed them into the spread (but if making the spread ahead of time would not do this until right before using). And I added just a dash of cayenne to make the flavors pop! I like to serve these with a salad of baby mixed greens with pears pecans and goat or feta cheese with the Maple Balsamic dressing from this site. Yummm - better than a 5-star restaurant!",

I only made two toasts (making lunch for myself) and omitted most of the butter, I did spread each slice thinly with butter.  Then I put on some blue cheese, and then pine nuts instead of walnuts.  Cooked for about 9 minutes at 400.  Came out great!  Will have to try walnuts next time.  Chives would be good added too.",
