I prepared this pretty much as directed using a good brand of canned San Marzano tomatoes (the best!) and added a glug of Chianti to the sauce. The aroma was mmmm so good and the dish itself was delicious flavorful and the perfect accompaniment to the \"Grilled Marinated Shrimp\" I served with it. As an Italian gal used to Italian cooking and food I can tell you this combination of typical Italian ingredients is pretty good stuff!",

It takes very little prep work other than roughly chopping veggies contains staples I usually have on hand anyway and the smell of the bacon and tomatoes cooking is heavenly! I emptied the bacon grease to cut down on the fat but didn't clean the pan our before cooking the onions to keep some additional flavor. I also added a splash of red wine to make the flavor a little heartier and mushrooms for more texture. We were out of Parmesan and it's just great even without cheese. My husband a meat and potatoes kind of guy loved this and had seconds (and he's on a diet!) I advise against using spaghetti noodles...the rotini or fusili make it easier to get the veggies and pasta together in one bite.",
