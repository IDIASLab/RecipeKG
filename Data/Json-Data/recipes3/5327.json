I brushed olive oil on the filets added a little bit of dill and rosemary and pepper and salt to each of them (not much just a little of each) then squeezed lemon juice on them and put some thin lemon slices on top wrapped them in foil put them on a baking sheet and into the oven.:) The cucumber salad was good too but I did add some chopped seeded tomatoe pieces and it was yummy. I also just used regular vinegar since that is what I had. Both went very well together! Thanks for the idea;)",
