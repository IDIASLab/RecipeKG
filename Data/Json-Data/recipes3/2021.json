She chops up the cabbage, salts it, lets it sit for about 10-15 minutes, then rings the water out of it and sautees it in butter or margarine. And she DOESN'T use onions! I think the onions ruined it for me. It still tasted pretty good, but not as yummy as my mom's! Next time...no onions.\n\n9/23/10\nI made this recipe again using my mother's tips (see above) and OH.MY.WORD.!!!! It was PERFECT! Definitely (in my opinion) NO ONIONS! The cabbage gets a sweet taste when you cook it and, combined with the salt and butter, it's mouth-watering. Brings me back to my childhood! :) With no onions and salting the cabbage before you cook it, I give it FIVE STARS!",

I began serving this up at our Little League games, where I run the concession stand and it just flies out of there.  I too, like to saute' the cooked cabbage and noodles together for a bit to mingle the flavors, and I never use onion - I like the cabbage flavor way too much.  To finish it off, I sprinkle it with a liberal dose of paprika and mix it all up while I finish sauteing.  Its often requested when I have to bring a covered dish.  I'm getting hungry for it, just thinking about it.",

I used penne pasta instead of the wide noodles ( it was all I had on hand) I think it was a great choice due to the texture and shape. First I sauted polish sausage in a little bit of olive oil then I removed them from the pan. I used a large white onion in place of the red added that to the pan and sauted until slightly tender then added cabbage until tender added the smoked sausage and the drained pasta. Oh and the most important part...2 Tbsp of white sugar! My husband usually hates when I cook smoked sausage....he LOVED this recipe. My 10 year old even loved it. I will make this again! Thank you so much for sharing this simply fast recipe!",

I used leftover noodles and just added a little white wine to the cabbage and onions so that there was enough liquid to soften up the noodles. I also threw in about a Tablespoon of caraway seeds and a Tablespoon of sugar (you can't really tell there's sugar in it but my mom says that cabbage gets a really mellow flavor if you add a touch of sweetness to it).
