I had to substitute pepperoni for the bacon which wasn't awful but the bacon would have been much better in my opinion. I thought the sauce was very nice but would have been better with a touch of white wine or a splash of vinegar to balance the sweetness of the cider. I didn't think it was too sweet though. I did not use the microwave to prepare this dish. I steamed fresh beans until tender and then added them to the onions and sauce. I'll make this again with bacon!",
