Made these again today using ground chicken in place of the ground pork. I even used less meat than called for (about 3 pounds total) by mistake without changing the dry or liquid measurements and they still came out fantastic. They're a wonderful comfort food and great alternative to the usual beef meatball. Serve w/mashed potatos and green beans - yum. Try these!",
