I used only olive oil and I sub'd skim milk for the h&h (to save a few fat grams of course!). I also pureed the soup -- I adore cream soups because they seem so decadent.

I left out celery (didn't have any) used a teaspoon dried thyme in stead of fresh and added an extra potato but those were the only modifications (well I did use fresh peppers. I just followed the directions from other reviews and it was very easy to do) Based on other reviews I was not sure if it would turn out thin (I like soups that are creamy and of thicker consistence) but decided I could always thicken it up with more flour later if needed. It turned out very thick and creamy almost a bit too thick when I went back for seconds I had to add some milk and heat up again. It was so thick from sitting one the stove for 30 minutes that I could have eaten it with a fork. So next time I will cut down on the flour. Next time I will also leave out the extra potato. Three is plenty even though I love potatoes. I might try to make it with half the potatoes and cauliflower instead of carrots. I think that will be a good match. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.",

It tastes like something you'd find in a fancy-pants restaurant;) I had about 10 fresh peppers from the market that needed to be used so I cut them in half and seeded them and roasted them open side down on a greased baking sheet for about 15 minutes at 450. They peeled easily once cooled. I also used only vegetable oil to saute the veggies as I had no butter (the 1/2and1/2 cream in the recipe gives the soup a very buttery taste in the end anyway!). Didn't have fresh thyme but for spices I used 1 teaspoon thyme 1 teaspoon curry 1/8 teaspoon cayenne and a dash of crushed chili peppers. It really turned out beautifully with a bright orange color and a tasty aroma that filled the house! This is a recipe I will make again:oP Yum!",
