(didn't stuff the bird for the first time ever)  I fiddled with amounts, personal preference.  Eliminated the salt, reduced butter by half, cut poultry seasoning by half and upped sage to 2 t. I used 20 slices of  oven dried whole wheat bread and only 1 1/2 c of the broth. I usually find casserole baked dressing dry and in need of a dousing with turkey drippings but this was not at all dry. I won't ever buy a bag of stuffing crumbs again.",

One with homemade breadcrumbs and the other with store bought. The best outcome was when I took 2 loaves of bread, cubed them and dried them in the oven to make homemade breadcrumbs ( serving 16). I found that they soak up the liquid a lot more then the really dried store bought bread crumbs, allowing them to retained a lot more flavour. I did make this recipe 2 days before each dinner.  It was the first dish to disappear. There were no left overs! This recipe made me look like a chef, when in reality I rarely have time to cook. Thank you!",

After years of making fancy stuffing for Thanksgiving my son begged me to make box stuffing which I couldn't bring my self to do. So on the hunt I went for a stuffing that called for basic ingredients and this one fit the bill. The fact that you can make it ahead was a bonus. For the bread crumbs I cubed a loaf of white and a loaf of wheat - placed on a cookie sheet and put in the oven at 250 degrees until the cubes felt stiff. I added just enough onion and celery to my liking and without measuring the broth added just enough until all the bread was moist. Added all the butter and seasonings as called for in the recipe. Next time I will cut down on the salt and store in a casserole dish instead of a bag.",
