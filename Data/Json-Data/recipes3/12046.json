I do wish that it was a bit 'firmer' b/c it was a little hard to serve and for lack of a better word soggy/soft on the bottom but it had good flavor. Next time I would serve this with some sauce on the side for topping. Keep an eye on the broiler b/c I only left mine in for 3 minutes and the top got quite brown so just keep that in mind. This was nice for a change. Thanks for sharing.:)",

I had drained the water out of my zucchini after I shredded it and again out of the pan after cooking, but it was still soggy. Maybe it should go under the broiler a bit first before adding the cheese. I'm not sure if that would help. It was a nice, different side dish though. Thanks for the recipe.",
