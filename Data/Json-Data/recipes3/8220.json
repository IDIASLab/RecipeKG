I cut down on the garlic powder to 2 Tablespoons as I love garlic but my husband throttles back on it. I can always sprinkle additional Garlic later if needed. I also substituted smoked paprika for the Cayenne Pepper as Wildie suggested. I have young grandsons that don't like the extra heat. I also added 1 Tablespoon of ground Thyme. It's one of my favorite spices so I threw it in. Thumbs up to this creation! My husband even commented on how good it was.",

I found that this blend is rather addictive in a good way: I couldn't stop eating it even though I didn't initially find it extraordinarily delicious. I think that it is the onion-garlic-ginger combination that makes it addictive although I wouldn't actually be able to identify a ginger flavor if I didn't know that ginger was an ingredient. I keep a shaker of it on the dinner table for \"regular salt.\" I made mine with Celtic sea salt and homemade 4-pepper blend. I found that \"Papa's Seasoning Salt\" became more delicious with time after the flavors melded. I made 100 servings which is about 1.5 cups.",
