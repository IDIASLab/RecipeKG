For serving of four: I used 5-6 small white potatoes (sliced thin) 1 small onion (diced), 5T flour, 5T butter, 2 and 1/4 c milk, 1/2t pepper, 1/2t dry mustard, 1t each of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and salt, pinch of cayenne pepper and 1/4 c parm cheese. OK grease 2 quart casserole dish, preheat over 425, make roux in saucepan: melt butter then whisk flour cook one minute until it resembles wet sand, add rest and cook until slight thick. put one layer potatoes, one layer onions, one layer sauce and continue once again. Top off with paprika and parm cheese, cook 425 5 minutes then 375 for 50 minutes. Awesome and actually very easy. Must try will not be sorry",

Ok, if you're looking for a fancy-type dish, then don't bother with it - and yes, there is no cheese, etc., so they are not \"au gratin\" potatoes.  These are just plain old down-home scalloped potatoes like granny used to make.  These go excellently with pork roast, pork chops, or pork tenderloin.  The only thing I did differently was to add pepper - I think that maybe the submitter forgot pepper in the ingredient list since she described it with \"seasonings\" (plural).  Also, maybe my oven is fast (convection), but 45 minutes was plenty (even maybe a bit too long) for cooking time.  Anyway, it's very simple and ingredients are all something I usually have on hand!

I was a little concerned over differing reviews. The \"bland\" part can always be rectified but the flour issues kind of worried me. I was happy to see JEPPER'S review because I thought the \"roux\" idea was a good one. I made my roux in a sauce pan, added my milk along with black pepper, onion and garlic powder, parm cheese and some cayenne for a little zippity-do-dah. I placed my first layer of potatoes in the dish and poured some of the sauce on top, in addition to more parm cheese. I repeated this and ended with another sprinkling of parm and paprika.
