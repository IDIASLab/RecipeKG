I would have done so but the middle was still very liquidy and to my family's preference not appetizing so I kept batch in the oven for about 10 minutes longer so that I could cut out and plate with dinner verse it looking a little sloppy. Having said that. We liked the recipe very much in the extended baking time. Even my son took a bite and said it was ok for he's not a spinach lover but did say he couldn't taste the spinach at all. But I really liked it. It wasn't over fabulous just really good. TY",
