We put it over a whole box of pasta and the kids raved about it... Even the 5 year old who usually demands only butter and cheese on her pasta. It would have fed between 6-8 people. Our family of four ate till we were stuffed and had enough for a bunch of leftovers.",

Now...bad news..my husband did NOT like it...he prefers a WETTER sauce. This is not a coat your pasta with tomato sauce-sauce. To me it's more the consistancy of a sloppy joe...but...tossed in pasta it WILL coat the noodles with flavor. I am giving it 5 BIG stars for ME personally...I WILL make it again but make it more \"saucy\" for hubby. THANKS for such a GREAT recipe!",
