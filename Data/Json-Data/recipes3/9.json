I did not use coconut because the group I made it for does not like coconut. Also I added 2 sliced bananas which were a nice compliment. Lastly the most critical change for this salad to be excellent is whip up 12 oz of heavy whipping cream and use that instead of cool whip. The salad is plenty sweet without the addition of more sweetness from the cool whip. The whipped heavy cream adds the creaminess the salad needs without taking the sweetness factor over the top.",
