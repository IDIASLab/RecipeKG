I think the Italian Seasoning made the difference otherwise they would have been very bland. Some dry ranch dressing would definitely be a good choice if using plain chicken. I really loved these.

Use 2 crescent roll tubes and put triangles together to make squares. The chicken will fit in the squares better and it will look tons better too. I had extra filling and put it in wraps with some romaine for lunch the next day just ate then cold. Yum!",

From those reviews I make this recipe with 4 oz cream cheese a dollop of sour cream rather than the milk and add garlic salt. My children and husband love them.
