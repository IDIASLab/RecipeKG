Also just like with baking bread you have to take into account the humidity. You'll use more flour Summertime in FL than you will in the dead of Winter in ND. As for taste... my own tastebuds prefer this without the brandy extract but each to his own. The gorgonzola cream sauce is decadent though:-)",
