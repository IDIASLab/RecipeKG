He hasn't been able to eat any type of bread for months because he can't have wheat flours or anything with yeast or any type of sugar in it.  Spelt is one of the few things he can have.  Since he also can't have any dairy, I substituted the milk with rice milk and used aluminum free baking powder and they are wonderful.  I've made them twice and will be adding them to our regular diet.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  ",
