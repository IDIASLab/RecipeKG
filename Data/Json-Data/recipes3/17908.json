They have a soft texture.  I would make them again; but, they will not be part of my regular rotation.  I think the 2 1/2 tablespoon size is too large.  I got a dozen big cookies, but could have gotten 2 dozen if I had made them smaller.  They were really sweet.  That could mean I should use a different brand of cake mix.",

The second time though, I had trouble with them - because it's cake (and not cookie) batter, it burns easily. I made 3 batches, and it was hard for me to know when to take them out. With my oven, 10 minutes wasn't enough (they were still mushy after cooling), and 13 meant browning one the bottom. I would also recommend experimenting with different cake mixes. So come out flatter or fluffier than others. I also wasn't sure how long/with what to mix the batter with. All-in-all, a good option to try out for a Valentine's day, but good luck on getting the texture right.",
