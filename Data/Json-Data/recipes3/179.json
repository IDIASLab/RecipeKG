I BELIEVE THAT THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR YOU WILL FIND THAT IF YOU FOLLOW GINA'S RECIPE AND USE THE OIL CALLED FOR , YOU WILL GET THE ULTIMATE CRISPY FRIED CHICKEN THAT WILL STILL BE JUICY ON THE INSIDE.I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT I ENJOYED TRYING SOMEONE ELSES RECIPE AND HAVING IT TURN OUT SOOOO DELICIOUS!!!

I bought a rotisserie chicken for dinner last night and had mashed potatoes and green beans, and my husband wanted a gravy to put on the chicken and potatoes.  My jarred gravy was expired, so I thought I would try this.  EASY to make and the taste was unbelievable.......and I didn't even have the chicken 'drippings' to include in it!  I will NEVER use jarred chicken gravy again.  Only changes - I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I added some thyme and rosemary instead, and I had to add a bit more flour mixture to get it to thicken up more.  I am so anxious now to try the chicken and will add my review when I do.",

I've made this recipe twice; the first time completely as instructed with gravy and the second time with a couple spice additions to the flour mixture as well as with a store bought gravy mix. The reason why I think I'll stay with the store bought is that the gravy does not have enough flavor for me and it was also too greasy and thin. It's too easy to just open up a pouch and spend two minutes boiling it up you know? I also end up adding more pepper and paprika to my flour mixture because my boyfriend and I like it a little more spicy. If you take anything away from this recipe though make it what I call the triple dunk technique: flour milk/egg and flour again. This combo really makes the glue like consistency that helps the flour STICK to the chicken so it doesn't all fall off when you put it into the oil. Overall a nice basic recipe for those who need to practice on perfecting their fried chicken.",
