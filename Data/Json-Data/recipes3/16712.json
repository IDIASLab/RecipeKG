I used fresh spinach - added it in with the onion by handfuls, adding more when the prior handful had wilted - and used club rolls for the hubby. I ate it spooned over riced cauliflower since I'm trying to watch carbs. It was awesome. We had the leftovers two nights later over the cauliflower rice again (I hadn't gone shopping again and we didn't have any more rolls). It was just as good, and the hubby said he'd eat it like that again (and he normally thinks cauliflower is bitter). Will definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing.",
