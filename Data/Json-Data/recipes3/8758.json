Rather than trying to grate a tomato, I simply blanched it which made the peel come off easily, then just chopped it up very fine. Scaling this down to two servings meant I had to improvise on the tomato sauce \u2013 I wasn\u2019t about to open a can for a mere tablespoon or two.  For those who might find themselves in the same situation, I used half the measurement in tomato paste and water instead and it obviously worked out great because this was simply delicious.

Oh so good easy- even when I screwed up a few things (accidentally threw the onions in with the tomatoes and had to pick them out so some onions weren't blanched prior to adding remaining ingredients saut\u00e9ed garlic with onions right off the bat...) I was making a big Mexican themed dinner and screwed this up a little- and it was to die for! I added 1 extra tomato for good measure as some reviewers had stated it was dry- I think like any time you make rice like this- better a little more moist than dry- watch not to over cook....for those reviews that said it was too dry don't think it was the recipe....I also halved the jalape\u00f1o for my guests as they don't like it so hot and that was a good call. It sat in a warm oven for about an hour afterwards while I finished everything else was so good!! Delicious!",
