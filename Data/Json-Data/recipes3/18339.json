They say that when made with vegetable broth, it was the favorite soup of vegetarian Leonardo da Vinci. Now you can add these interesting facts to your dinner party conversation repertoire. As for the cinnamon, the safe play is to not add any and live happily ever after. But in tiny amounts it lends a mysterious, warming background note.",

The subtle hint of cinnamon and sage are contrasted against the sweetness of the oh-so-slowly cooked red onions. Watch the video and he'll tell you that for photo opportunity he placed the toast on top of the soup. Traditionally the toast is placed in the bottom of the bowl and the hot soup is poured over. To make it super authentic top the bowl of soup with a gently poached egg. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe. This recipe has bumped my French onion soup out of the usual rotation.",

I pan fried the bread in olive oil to get a tasty golden crust on both sides and melted freshly grated parmesan on top. Served it old style, bread on the bottom, soup on top. A bit more cheese then.  It is both delicious and surprisingly unique. Wasn't very hard to make. Two thumbs up, give it a try!",

A large sheet pan and plenty of olive oil were perfect to do this and I stirred often over the course of an hour or more. I swore I wouldn't use too much cinnamon but I think I did. I think that's why I liked this rather than loved it. With the cheese toasts two more tsp. vinegar to the pot and lots of fresh ground pepper it was still good but I won't use cinnamon next time or just glance at the jar. Overall a good way to make onion soup. Thanks Chef John!",
