Not amazing or anything but a decent recipe and easy enough to put together and very nice for a light dinner with a dise salad. The second time I made it I didn't have any bread on hand (other than the squishy \"pillow\" bread which isn't really good for anything except getting the kids to eat peanut butter) I DID have some asiago cheese bagels from Panera that were getting stale though. I sliced them in half and then in half again (so I had 4 thin circles from each bagel) and LET ME TELL YOU it was OUTSTANDING! WOW! I plan on making this again the next time we have overnight guests and I will buy the bagels just for this. Even my six year old who turned up her nose at it the first time ate two helpings when I made it with the bagels. I wish I could give it more than five stars. Thanks for a great recipe!",
