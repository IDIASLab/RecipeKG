Don t worry you won t break a tooth it s perfectly O.K. to enjoy them immediately. Not one flavor dominates and they re simply creamy and chocolatey. I cut mine into 16 pieces so they re one bite. Super easy to make and I love having these on hand in freezer for a quick morning breakfast with a cup of coffee or a satisfying snack later in the day. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
