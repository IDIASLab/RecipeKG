I found a jar of Cucumber Ketchup in the back of the fridge that had been in there two years. It was still delicious.",

The SALT must need to be rinsed off of the cucumber and onion mixture before you puree it because following the above instructions (and this was after the anticipation of my whole family waiting three days to taste it) produced a substance too salty to consume. It was overwhelming and I LOVE salt. We were so disappointed. I could tell however had it NOT been so salty it would have been delicious--with bright cucumber notes and the slight heat from the mustard seeds? I still cannot bring myself to dump it out but it is inedible. I plan to try it again next time we have a surplus of cucumbers I will update my results when I do. I have never left a negative review here and I certainly mean no disrespect to the individual who posted this recipe. It sounds like a wonderful idea!",
