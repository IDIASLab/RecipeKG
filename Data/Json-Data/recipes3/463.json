I mixed together 12ozs lite whipped cream blueberry flavored cream cheese and about 1/4 cup milk. No sugar. Then I added about 1/4 of the blueberries. I cut my cake in half and spread some of the whipped cream mixture between the layers. Then I covered the rest of the cake with the mixture. I cooked the rest of the blueberries making essentially pie filling. I drizzled that on the top of the cake. It was delicious! My family all went back for seconds. We will be making this again and again! Thanks for a great recipe!",
