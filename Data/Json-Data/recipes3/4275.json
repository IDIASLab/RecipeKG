First off along with the onion I added a good helping of minced garlic and seasoned the meat a bit at that time. I reduced the amount of chili powder called for in the recipie greatly and made up for it with cumin - my favorite spice for chili and other mexican dishes. I also added sage thyme oregano basil and rosemary to round out the flavors - I know I'm a spiceaholic but when I make my \"everything in the spice cabinet chili\" I always get rave reviews. I also added a can of red beans because I felt as a couple of other reviewers also did that something else was needed. Served with brown rice and with a bit of cheddar cheese sprinkled on top this is wonderful!",
