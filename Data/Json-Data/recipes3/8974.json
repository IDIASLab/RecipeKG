I did remove the seeds from the jalapenos prior to adding them into the butter/olive oil mixture and I think this kept the hotness to a minimum. If you remove the seeds you are probably safe to leave the jalapenos in. I did remove the peppers but served them alongside the meal and they were gobbled up along with the entire dish. Will certainly make this again - Matty1124 thanks for the new recipe! One last dish - this was so easy to make and kitchen clean-up was super easy!",

I didn't have fresh jalapenos so I used pickled as another reviewer did and I left them in not the whole time but for longer than the recipe called for. I tasted the sauce and knew it would be too spicy at that point for my family. I should have removed them as directed or better yet I should of had fresh without the seeds. But even so just the quantity of the red paper flakes made it a bit too much for my family (not me). So even taking out the spiciness capers were a new experience to some in my family and they didn't much care for that flavor either. Myself I would make this again and tame down the spiciness a bit but with that many capers the rest of the family really won't care for it. I liked the basic sauce and I can actually learn from my mistakes here and make something my family will like. I might even get in a few capers just not too many.",
