I made it as written except for adding the milk because I didn't drain either the tomatoes (I used mild Rotel) or the hatch chilies that I used.  It was plenty moist enough, but I'm thinking I was maybe missing the tomato sauce (or something along that line) on the top as it was baking---or maybe it just needed more salt.  Or maybe both.  I would make this again with a few changes.  But I would definitely try it again.  Thanks for the recipe!",
