I thought I'd try this route for healthy cooking but the broth evaporated before the chicken was fully cooked so I ended up adding butter & olive oil after about 10 minutes. Although not how the original recipe intended, it turned out really good. If you don't have roasted red pepper on hand, you can just put it over a gas burner flame or grill it on a BBQ, black scorch marks and all, then peel, seed, and chop it up. It worked out great that way. When I added the vegetables, I covered the pan to keep the chicken moist. Total cook time was more like 10 minutes for 3 big chicken breasts plus 8 minutes more after adding the veggies. I think next time I might saute the chicken in olive oil, deglaze the pan with broth and then add the veggies chicken for last 10 minutes. The balsamic ties the strong flavor of the vegetables together with the chicken nicely. ",

I am on the South Beach Diet Phase 1 and I reaaly enjoyed this recipe!\nThe 1/2 cup of chicken broth had evaporated when it was time to add the veggies, so I added more.  It made a good sauce for the chicken.  I double the vinegar and it gave it a little \"kick\".  Since I didn't have any low fat cheese, I skipped it.  I will prepare this often but will make sure that I have the low fat cheese on hand in the future.  My husband loved it as well. He said \"It's a keeper.\"",

I even added some Parmesan to the mozzarella and it was still nothing to die for. I was pretty disappointed because of all the rave reviews but I can't figure out what would jazz this recipe up.
