So with some remnants of red orange yellow and green peppers a couple of chicken breasts in the freezer and a partial package of orecchiette (little ears) pasta in the pantry I threw together one heck of a fine meal with this recipe. It comes together quickly and easily with a minimum of steps. It uses just a few simple fresh and delicious ingredients with classic piccata style (lemon butter sauce and fresh parsley) flavors. But five stars? You bet. Just because it s easy and just because it s humble doesn t mean it isn t worthy! Other than not measuring precisely and other than adding a little glug of white wine I followed the recipe pretty closely. Oh...and as always in consideration of Hubs sensitive innards I left out the cayenne. (But if I was to add a little kick I would have preferred crushed red pepper flakes) As I mentioned earlier I tossed this with orecchiette pasta and to complete the meal I served it with a Caesar salad.",

If I had it at somebody else's house I'd definitely enjoy and compliment it but knowing the cost and effort that goes into it I now know it's really not worth it. A few things to make sure of if you do decide to make it: It calls for way too much onion. The colorful peppers were nearly hidden by all the onion and it made it look like there was very little chicken. Use half as much onion. Also be sure not to overcook the peppers and onions - I didn't have this problem but I could easily see it happening. Finally add capers! Chicken Piccata just ain't Chicken Piccata without capers. (I've always considered them part of the definition of Chicken Piccata.) They add a lot of flavor and complexity to this recipe. I served it over bow-tie pasta. I was glad I did as it would have otherwise been kind of plain. Reducing the onions by half would make it look a lot less plain because the colors of the peppers would show better. All in all a tasty meal - but one I probably won't have again.",
