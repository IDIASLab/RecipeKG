The spices add to the sweet flavor with a bit of kick. The only thing I would recommend is baking the fries at 425 for 40 minutes on a cookie sheet instead of pan frying them. I tried pan frying a handful of them and then baked the rest in the oven, but the pan fried ones didn't turn out nearly as good as the baked ones. It is true that sweet potato fries don't get as crispy as regular potatoes, so don't expect these to be crunchy; just expect them to be delicious!",
