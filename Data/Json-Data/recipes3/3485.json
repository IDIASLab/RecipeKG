First we learned to make bircuits then we learned to hard-boil an egg and then we learned to make the white sauce (that's what it used to be called). Finally we learned to put it all together; and I don't know if it was because I'd made it myself but I thought it was one of the bests meals I'd ever tasted. So much so that I made it for Mom and Dad that night. I was so happy to see this recipe on 'allrecipes'. Thank you for bringing back a happy 57-year-old memory!",
