        "description": "I smoke a 6-10 pound Boston Butt ahead of time, slicing off some for a dinner and then pulling the rest for pulled pork sandwiches and of course Barbecue Lasagna. If you're accustomed to pulled pork you are ahead of the game as there are many pulled pork recipes online. Too much work? There are ready-made pork alternatives in most grocery stores. Same for barbeque sauce -- there are good recipes on the web or use your favorite store-bought brand. I guess I use about 2 pounds of pork in the lasagna. Mix sauce with pulled pork in a sauce pan and bring it to a slow simmer so it will spread easily.",

I also cooked the entire box of lasagna noodles and literally used 8 of them (4 for each layer). There was only enough ricotta and meat for two layers but it was perfect. Next time I make a boston butt this will be made with the leftovers. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I was looking for something creative to do with slow cooked pork BBQ leftovers (I added Bull's Eye since the meat wasn't too saucy) and this couldn't have been more perfect! I followed the recipe ingredients exactly but was pretty absent-minded/lazy about following the dirsctions (got the layers out of order didn't spread things evenly put the cheese on top in the beginning instead of the last 5 minutes) but it turned out amazing! My husband and I were blown away. This would be perfect to take over to someone's house to be re-heated if you wanted to drop off dinner or for a pot-luck tailgate etc. where it could sit out a while. It was fairly quick to make and you could probably use any kind of slow cooked meat. Imagine the possibilities...leftover pot roast and mashed potatoes BBQ chicken mexican beef etc. Delicious and creative I'll certainly be adding this recipe to my regular rotation!",

For the dish I used the proportions were off (I didn't use nearly all of the shredded cheese and could have used more ricotta). I added a hearty dash of onion powder to the ricotta mixture because I couldn't comprehend this dish without at least a little bit of seasoning of some sort. Overall this was edible but weird.
