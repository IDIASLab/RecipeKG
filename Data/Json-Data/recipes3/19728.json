Probably could have used just a littel more juice but no complaints.  I find a lot of items are so tender but overcooked really in the slow cooker so I am away 10 hours or more.  So find using frozen meats elimiated need to thaw and prevents the complete disintegration of the meat when you cut it.  Was still extremely tender and bone just fell out - will definately make again!!",

The extra ingredients are many of the flavors in a Polish stew recipe that uses sauerkraut and pork (Bigos Stew). I first seasoned the pork chops with seasoned salt and garlic powder. Then I browned the pork chops for approx. 2-3 min. on each side. The additional ingredients added to the crock pot were diced tomatoes, onion, 4 cloves of roasted garlic, 2 slices of chopped bacon, 1 tsp of marjoram and caraway seeds, and a tablespoon of brown sugar.",

I browned and seasoned the chops with a homemade seasoning given to me by my uncle and I also added chicken broth, a sliced onion, and added 2 sliced and peeled apples that I had on hand.  I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top\u2026.It was amazing! My husband often teases me that I over cook pork chops and he just raved and raved about how good this dinner was.  It made my day, especially since my husband is often right (I do tend to over cook pork chops)!  This recipe and the feedback regarding the recipe were very helpful.   The meat was so tender and the taste was fantastic.  My girls don\u2019t tend to like sauerkraut \u2013 but even though it was main part of the recipe they even gave it 5 stars!  I cooked this on high for 4 hours and low for 2 hours.  Thanks! Mari Beth",
