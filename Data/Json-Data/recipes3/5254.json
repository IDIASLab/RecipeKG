If you save the whey you can make ricotta! (1/4 cup of vinegar for 2 gallons of whey) ",

I just went to a cheesemaking class and these were the exact ingredients in the cheese we made.  We didn't put the salt in until after the cheese had drained, mixing it into the cheese, not the milk.  We also only went to 180 degrees temp.  The fresh cheese is VERY good.  I suggest mixing in a bit of pepper and herbs for a wonderful, spreadable herbed cheese - great on breads or crackers.",

I do not have a thermometer so I watched for it to just start to boil. Stirred just once during boiling time (which I did on the lowest temp of a gas range). When it started to boil I shut it off and added the vinegar let it sit for 10 min. stirred again and saw the yellow whey. Used two knee highs (new) one inside the other drained and squeezed. Added salt to taste after draining and squeezing(not to milk) and presto!! Wonderful!! Thanks!!",

Unfortunately, we don't have any cheesecloth, but I found that an old, clean pair of pantyhose does the trick just as well.  It yielded a ricotta-style cheese that would be good in filled pasta.  Not much flavor, though, so consider doctoring it up to your liking. Mine was done in about 45 minutes.",
