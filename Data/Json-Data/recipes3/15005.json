I took the leftovers to work the next day and they held up nicely. I've smoked whole chickens and cornish in the past but never would have thought to smoke wings.  Hubby has made it clear that this recipe will be used every time we bust out the smoker and I agree. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!",
