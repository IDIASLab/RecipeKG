I made the recipe as written with 2 exceptions: I thoroughly rinsed the beans in a collander or sieve prior to cooking so as to eliminate the gassy after effects that beans have on some people. Also I find that adding a little wine or cooking sherry gives the beans a great flavor. Just before serving I added a small dollop of sour cream with a few leaves of fresh cilantro and a tortilla chip sticking out of the sour cream. I received rave reviews and requests for 2nd and 3rd helpings.",

The only change I made was to use 2 - 10 oz cans of Rotel tomatoes instead of 1 - 14.5 can cause that is what I had on hand and I did not want to waste the leftover tomatoes. Each person added freshly grated Parmesan cheese to their liking and I had sour cream available for those who wanted it. My only suggestion is if you do not like hot (spicy) soup either decrease the amount of cayenne pepper or do not use at all. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for the GREAT recipe.",
