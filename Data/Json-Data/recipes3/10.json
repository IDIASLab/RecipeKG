I use ripe peppers instead of green - try roasting them first for extra flavor.  I always make it a day ahead - it improves with more time in the fridge. \r\n\r\nThe recipe holds up very well to modification -- add marinated artichoke, fresh basil leaves, pine nuts and substitute salami and romano (instead of bacon and chedder) for an Italian twist.  Spice it up with roasted chipotle or jalapeno peppers - don't be afraid of trying other cheeses -  smoked gouda or crumbled blue are delicious substitutions.",

The second time I reduced the mayonnaise to one cup and found that to be just fine. There was enough dressing even with that reduction. I also took some other reviewers suggestion and just mixed everything together. I was taking it to a parish picnic and thought it would be easier that way. I would probably do that again in the future. Some reviewers said they thought it was better the second day but I did not. I thought it was a little too moist probably because the juice from the tomatoes was released. I highly recommend this for a different and tasty salad.",

I omitted the tomatoes peppers and onions and added 1 can of rotel (drained). I was very surprised at how good this was. This would be a perfect side dish at a picnic BBQ or any kind of warm weather get together. Will Definately make again just not as much as it does make a rather large amount. Next time I might spice it up with some chili powder or cayenne pepper added to the dressing. Might also drain the rotel into that dressing to help with the flavor more also. Thanks for this recipe my mom is glad to have it also!",
