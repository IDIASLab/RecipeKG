The fresh-ground spices resulted in a huge burst of flavor. I served the mixture in parathas (bought frozen from the Indian grocery). It would also be great over rice. Any suggestions as to how to make without the tamarind pulp? I am moving soon and it might be hard to find - it's also kind of annoying because it is only sold in big packages and I don't use it for anything else.",
