My modifications were skipping the cooking spray (we just shouldn't eat things in aerosol cans) was sadly out of parsley skipped adobo seasoning added garlic powder dried minced onions only had 1/2 cup of bread crumbs so I made up the rest with wheat germ and I put 3/4 cup of cheddar inside. On the top I put Trader Joes barbecue sauce. AGain I think it will be good.",
