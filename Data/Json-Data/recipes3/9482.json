It seems to dilute the cheese flavor. This simple but tasty recipe was given to me at a church supper in Terre Haute; it's old, definitely has German or Jewish (kugel?) roots. The secret is to use a good-quality EXTRA-SHARP Cheddar cheese.",

This one was iffy, so I used HALF of the sweetened condensed milk and added regular milk and doubled the amount of macaroni. At dinner, people STILL said it was too sweet. NO ONE liked it. Looked at the can. 220 grams of sugar. OVER ONE CUP. So I put a little over a half a cup in my mac and cheese.\nThe good reviews where people made half the macaroni and twice the sugar...I think they threw it out to and didn't want to admit it was too sweet. \nDinner ruined. Threw out what wasn't eaten.Please do us all a favor and remove this recipe. Oh, and people, do us a favor...if you leave out an ingredient and it comes out good make your own recipe, don't give 5 stars to the one that had all the sugar.",
