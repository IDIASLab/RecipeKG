The adults topped the sandwich off with the poached egg while the kids opted out of the poached egg and went with a raspberry jam on top.

You can use many different kinds of cheese as long as they are melty.\n\nChef John, thank you for another yummy recipe.",

It was enough to have a hint of lemon but not noticeable enough to deter my boys. I love it with the havarti instead of Swiss like I do with the monte cristos.

I'm not sure the cayenne lemon zest nutmeg and salt in the batter made any significant contribution in the flavor as opposed to a traditional egg batter for French toast. Maybe more spices are needed? I felt the 1 egg on top would have been better if it were 2 eggs as the sandwich was somewhat dry. I think this dish could be better with some tweaking.
