They came out perfect! I also had leftover chiles so I used the same idea and put cheese in them rolled in butter and bread crumbs and put in the oven with the chicken. It was a yummy side.

The thickness of the cheese made the chicken a little difficult to roll and encase the filling so next time I think I'll shred the cheese and chop the pepper. During the last fifteen minutes of baking I made a mixture of salsa and sour cream and poured it over the chicken. The pepper jack cheese I used added just the right amount of heat and the sauce smoothed it all out. Thanks so much Erin for a very different kind of Kiev!",

I put cheese on the inside of the fold w/ green chilies and another on top. I didn't do any refrigeration and popped them in the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes covered in aluminum and another 20-25 with the cover off. I had none of the problems other reviews mentioned about cheese spilling out. Also I added lots of southwest seasoning and parmesan to the coating and served w/ Spanish rice and refried beans (another excellent suggestion!). This turned out beautifully! I will make again.",
