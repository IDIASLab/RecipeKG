One note about the croutons - the amounts listed for salt and pepper were very heavy even though I doubled the bread - start at about 1/3 of the amount listed and go from there. FYI these are 4 VERY LARGE servings!! For typical side salad servings it would be closer to 8-10. Such a great salad & it does taste just like a BLT. It even kept well in the fridge overnight to my delight!",

Anyway I taste tested the dressing before and after adding the basil. Even though I'm a huge basil fan I think I liked the dressing better without it. Since basil is not a traditional BLT ingredient I'll omit it next time. Also we usually don't have croutons on our salad so I decided to add the salt and pepper to the prepared dressing. The whole tsp of pepper was great but the tsp of salt was too much in combination with the bacon which is already fairly salty - I added more mayo and some milk to compensate. Next time I'll add the salt to taste. Please note my rating of 4 stars was not because of the revisions I made to this recipe but because I thought the dressing prepared as directed tasted better without the basil.",
