Just needed some jazz.\" W/ only salt and chili powder going into the ground beef one taste and I had to add a heaping scoop of AR's \"Taco Seasoning I\" and when I plated everything I was tempted to add cheese and salsa but wanted to follow the recipe as written. A lovely light dish but the spinach was disappointing just laying all limp below everything else calling out for dressing or something. I would gladly make this again but would have to doll up the meat considerably and use Catalina dressing or salsa on top.",
