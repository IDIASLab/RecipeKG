DH doesn't like mushrooms so I left those out and used cream of celery soup instead. When making the sauce I ended up adding another 1/2 c of milk because it was so thick. I didn't use the optional ricotta because I didn't have any. My sauce was a bit too salty for me with all the ingredients and I think the ricotta would have helped mellow it. I ended up adding some sour cream and that helped with the saltiness. I doubled the bacon (removing half the drippings) and used about 14 meatballs. Overall nice recipe that is easily tweaked to your preferences.",
