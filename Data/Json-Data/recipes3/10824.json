The marinade was really good and didn't take long at all - basically the time it took to prep the veggies make the foil packets and whip up some homemade guacamole! I cooked the steak on the grill vs. a foil packet simply because I couldn't bring myself to \"steam\" a good piece of meat. I put the foil packets for the veggies and tortillas on the grill as well. I did poke a few holes in the veggie packets to allow some of the steam to get out so they weren't soggy. Overall very good especially with all the fixen's - cheese salsa guacamole and sour cream!",

                "reviewBody": "I think the biggest yet simplest to fix problem is the WAY the foil is used. Simple leave a large opening not just holes in the foil to allow ALL steam to escape. I personally would do this on flat open foil for an \" oven fried\" taste then draw foil up loosely around the food to keep warm. The marinate is very good but I add cumin garlic powder and Mexican oregano ( regular oregano works well too) to the chilli powder. I like a blend of EQUAL PARTS (1t. each) of cumin garlic powder oregano and chilli powder. That does give much more of a taco flavor ( b/c of the cumin) but can be adjusted by adding less cumin and slightly more chilli powder. If that is your taste. In fact I make up that blend of equal parts of those spices in a 1 to 2 cup jar in my spice cabinet and use it to make many Mexican foods including tacos. It is cheaper and healthier ( b/c No over load of salt) than the envelopes that charge 1.00 or so for a single serving. Overall a quick easy anytime meal that balances some veggies meat and starch in a a convient way. BTW that spice blend makes a great tex mex rub. Hope this gives even more ideas for using quick easy foil meals. Oh yeah try theses ideas on a larger scale on a foil cooked pot roast. Just roast L O N G ( a few hrs)and low temp(275) any weekend. Then serve fejitas or quesadillas w/ the left overs.",
