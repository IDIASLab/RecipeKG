If you spray the bowl with some Pam first, the egg will slide right out and you won't have that cooked on egg that is impossible to scrub off your dishes. I only microwave one egg at about 45 seconds and then top it with cheese and microwave it for the last 15 seconds. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and viola. This is so versatile too. You can add bacon, sausage, ham, tomato, etc. And you can use any bread you have (sandwich, hamburger roll, English muffin, croissant, etc.) and it turns out great every time! So easy a man, I mean the kids could do it!",

I had one of those microwave omelette pans (which asks for two eggs, wisked, to be poured on each side). All he did was add salt and pepper to each wisked egg and cook it in the microwave omelette pan. Then, he cut it in half to make two sandwiches. Good for them, GREAT for me. NOTE: You might want to keep in mind that you may need to spritz your microwaveable container with non-stick spray before you cook your egg. Having made egg in the microwave before, they do tend to want to stick pretty bad if you don't.",

Whether I cook them in a skillet or the microwave (scrambled or just cooked whole and breaking the yoke) make sure the skillet (or the microwave safe dinner plate is liberally sprayed with butter-flavored Pam as well as the inside of the cookie cutters. Either way the eggs cook up pretty quickly so be careful that the bottoms don't scorch. When one side is cooked carefully turn the eggs over remove cookie cuters (they should slide off easily) and finish cooking the other side if need be. Perfect sized eggs for an English muffin! I bought my cookie cutters at K- Mart about ten years ago but I'm sure you can still find them there or maybe at WalMart's.",
