I do NOT like sweet relish (I know most cold salads like this always use it, so I change it!), instead I used dill...and more of it...more like 1/4 cup.  I added a little chopped cucumber (seeds removed), a dash of garlic powder, and used green onion in place of regular onion.  Great base recipe though.  Thanks for posting.",

I've made it a few times and I'm still tweaking it. Garlic powder helps! I made it yesterday added a little leftover chopped cooked chicken. That would make a great light lunch would be awesome at work! Could probably add tuna without hurting the recipe... Oh one more thing: I always put in dill relish instead of sweet relish the pickle adds extra yumminess!:)",
