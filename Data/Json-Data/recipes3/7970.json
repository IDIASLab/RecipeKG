I used a mortar and pestle to form the spice paste, but you can easily use a small bowl and the back side of a spoon. Be sure to pair it with sides that counteract the heat. I served this alongside rice with peas and onions mixed in. It was perfect! The salad that I served the chicken on top of, Green Chile and Tomato Salad, is also another recipe of mine on this site.

So I just substituted 1 teaspoon of Chipotle sauce for the chipotle pepper in the adobe sauce. Then since I was out of the paprika required I substituted 1 tsp hot paprika in place of the smoked paprika (figured it had to be better than chili powder as a substitute). It turned out awesome for the Spring salad mixed with Baby kale and shredded carrots. I tossed it with our favorite dressing Raspberry vinaigrette. Delicious!!!",

I didn't have a mortar and pestle so I just used the end of a wooden spoon to mash the marinade together. It did form a paste but it wasn't easy to spread. Once I coated both sides of the chicken I drizzled the olive oil and sprinkled s & p on them before cooking them in a cast iron pan (it's winter and I can't grill). Even though this wasn't made exactly as written it was excellent and going into my best of 2019 file. Thank you!",
