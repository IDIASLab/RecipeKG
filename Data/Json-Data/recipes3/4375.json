So I sauteed a sweet onion and fresh mushrooms in evo, blanched some fresh peas, used canned red salmon instead of pink and seasoned the sauce with thyme and white pepper.  I served it over whole wheat pasta and loved it!  Since I had no liquid from the peas, I thinned the sauce with a bit of the pasta water.  We will be having this agin for sure.",
