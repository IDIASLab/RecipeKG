I am a bit fussy with seasonings but decided to follow the recipe.  Only differences were I used 1/3 the amount of salt and I sauteed the spices in olive oil before mixing with the tomatoes.  I did use my favorite brand of organic tomatoes (Muir).  Net result was fantastic.  I particularly like that I cooked the zucchini as directed and it came out \"au dente\".  Lovely!!!!",

Just WAY too much sauce.\" 3 zucchini weren't nearly enough for this recipe, and I had to quick make a pot of noodles to supplement the much-needed filler. Maybe if the tomato sauce can was an 8 oz. instead of 15 oz. or if the recipe specified the zucchini in a cups' quantity instead of just \"3 zucchini.\" Truly, the meat/tomato sauce WAS great tasting, but after mixing the zucchini noodles into it (the current photo for the recipe has the sauce just spooned on top of the zoodles), they just disappeared altogether.",

I (always) use soy crumbles instead of ground beef and also didn't read the shopping list correctly when shopping so ended up with an 8oz can of tomato sauce rather than the 15oz the recipe calls for so I about 5oz water to make up for lack of liquid. Otherwise followed recipe and really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!",
