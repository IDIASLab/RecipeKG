I mostly followed the recipe (without the peppers), but I didn't mix the meat and spices in a bowl first.  It produces so much liquid that the spices get well-mixed during the canning process.\r\n\r\nI used quart jars (must process for 90 minutes).  I placed the cubed venison in the jars with some onion and a few garlic cloves on top.  I sprinkled the salt and pepper on top of that.  I used 1 teaspoon for the quart and found it to be almost a little too salty, so the next time I made it, I used slightly less than 1 tsp.\r\n\r\nIt's not the most attractive concoction in a clear jar, but it's really tasty and tender.  We gave some to a friend who absolutely loved it.  We've used it as is and mixed with bbq sauce, seasoned black beans, or a canned tomato/black-eyed pea mix.  It's very versatile.\r\n\r\nIt's a keeper!",
