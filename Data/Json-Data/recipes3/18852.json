And they are good - plus the colours of paprika and parsley flakes give it an added Xmas flair.    But I do agree with previous reviewers comments with regard to the amount of the egg yolk in relation to other ingredients.  Maybe the recipe was written for extra large sized eggs.  I mixed the other ingredients separately and then added the mixture to the mashed yolks until the desired consistency was reached, but there was quite a bit left over.  Had I added the entire amount, it would have been way too runny.  So as much as I think this recipe deserves 5 stars or better, the directions should be add a word of caution regarding the variance in egg size.",
