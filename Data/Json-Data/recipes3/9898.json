They hold well in a low oven while you finish the rest.  I knocked these down one star because they really need to be dusted with flour prior to going into the batter, so the batter will stick and the batter needs a little more seasoning - maybe a little cayenne.  I sliced the onions and let soak in cold water as directed, in a salad spinner - drained and spun dry, which worked great.   Very nice recipe that I would use again and again with just a few simple changes.  Thanks Elle.",

I did find that the recipe barely was enough for my 2 onions using 1/2 inch slices but perhaps that was because of the size of them. I did use a deep fat fryer rather than a pan on the stove. On the first batch I used the wire basket that came with my fryer. Big mistake. The batter oozed through the basket and made a large onion clump that wouldn't come out. After that I made small batches directly in the fryer and they came out perfect.",
