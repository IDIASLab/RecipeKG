Do NOT cook shrimp longer than 3 minutes or the shrimp will be tough. 3 minutes is the standard for cooking shrimp regardless of the size of the shrimp.\r\n\r\nFor \"shrimp and grits\" add shrimp mixture to the grits at the last minute and stir well. Of course the traditional way to serve it is to pour some grits in each bowl and ladle the shrimp mixture on top.\r\n\r\nI just had one of the Charleston versions of \"shrimp and grits\" at Bobo's on James Island (south of Charleston) a week ago. Their version adds cheese, crumbled bacon, and grilled shrimp (in that order) on top of the bowl of grits. Other versions add bits of ham or smoked sausage in the \"sauce\" along with the shrimp which is added in the last 3 minutes of cooking. One version actually added lima beans, corn, and tomatoes to their shrimp mixture to put on top of the grits. Surprisingly it tasted good also. I tried the smoked sausage version at home a couple of days ago. It was wonderful.\r\n\r\nA good recipe for breakfast, brunch, lunch/dinner, or dinner/supper.\r\n\r\n",

For the big night I used a stick of butter instead of a tablespoon and as always I cooked the shrimp separately. It's easy to over cook shrimp if you throw it into the pot with everything else and rubbery shrimp is nasty! I saute it with butter onion and black pepper for 3 minutes and add it to the recipe just before serving. It was a big hit at supper club everybody wanted the recipe.",

As with other commenters true blue Charlestonians use bacon for the smoke flavoring which is fried and removed from the pan (my family and most folks we knew used \"butts meat \" kind of a meatier smoked salt pork while non-pork eaters might use some other smoked meat sauteed in vegetable oil; floured and seasoned shrimp is lightly fried/sauteed in the remaining oil then removed to drain on paper towels; a little yellow or Vidalia onion is sauteed in the same oil; a roux is made from some of the remaining oil with flour; a nice light brown gravy is made from the roux and seasoned with salt and pepper; add the shrimp to the gravy and simmer a couple of minutes. Serve over creamy hominy grits with a little of the smoked meat on the side. That's Charleston! A big problem I've had with grits in some of the \"local\" Charleston restaurants -- the chefs are usually from somewhere other than the South and the grits are bland and undercooked.",
