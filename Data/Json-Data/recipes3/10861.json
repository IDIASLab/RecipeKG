A couple of things they altered is that I like to take my cuts of chicken (thighs my favorite for this) and dredge them in a flour/salt/curry powder mix and brown them in a saute pan with butter prior to placing in the baking dish. Also, once you have cooked up the bacon, onion and apple, thoroughly stir in your flour and let it cook for a minute prior to adding the liquids as it helps alleviate any issue with chunks of flour.",
