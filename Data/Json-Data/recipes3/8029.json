I added the garlic powder, dill, salt and pepper, then covered each one with half-slices of thick-sliced bacon so that it looked like the picture above.  Baked at 375 for about 20 - 22 min., then broiled carefully on high, at about 6-inches below the broiler until the bacon was crisp--about 4 - 5 minutes.  (Don't ignore it, or let it get away!) The result? Splendid!  Best salmon filets I have ever had! These were nice big 8 oz filets with good thick bacon, and were a real treat,  worthy of professional offering as a seafood main course !",

My husband is DEFINTELY a salmon/fish snob and he rarely eats it if it's not grilled. Since we had to ditch our grill before moving across the country I have been trying different methods of cooking fish. I have failed miserably MANY times and this was my FIRST SUCCESS! We both ranked this 10/10. The salmon stayed moist and flaky and the bacon with it was great. Unusual but delicious flavor combination. Next time I might try cooking it on a broiling pan so the oils/juices can run down just as an experiment. I'll post an update if it produces anything different. Yum yum yum--enjoy!",

But that's a given considering it's topped with bacon! I personally think 20-25 mins is a little long. Instead I increased the temp to 425 for the first 5 mins then 400 for another 10 mins and the salmon was perfectly cooked and moist plus the bacon was just how I like it. No need to broil at the end. I wasn't that hungry but I ended up eating both pieces I made because it was so good! I didn't even have a chance to take a pic. Next time!",
