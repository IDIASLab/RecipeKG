Drained and mixed in a creamy alfredo sauce and kept warm on low heat. I finely chopped the onions added chopped celery and sauteed those 'til soft then added the parsley salt & chili powder. Let that saute for a few more minutes then added two cooked & cubed chicken breasts. Instead of orange juice I used chicken broth added in about 1/4 C. orange marmalade and a squirt of lime juice and let it all simmer for 30 minutes. Added that to my pasta & alfredo saude and it was great.",
