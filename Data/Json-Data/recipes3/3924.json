                "reviewBody": "Great recipe - fantastic touch with the soy in the mushrooms.  Some slight variations for my health conscious family:  Burgers: - Seasoned with 1 egg, 2 tbsp of water, 1/4 dry multigrain breadcrumbs (can use regular), 1 small onion finely chopped, 2 tsp of dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/2 worcestershire sauce for every 1 lb of lean ground beef. (Didn't use the meat tenderizer since the water kept it moist) - Added swiss cheese to each burger when cooked and on the grill. (Can be done in a pan as well - make sure to drain the fat)  Mushrooms: - A little extra virgin olive oil instead of butter - Added 1/4 tsp minced garlic to warm olive oil - Brought the temperature down to medium and lay fresh sliced mushrooms flat on a skillet and let it stew in its own juices rather than stirring.  This brings out the full flavour of the mushrooms. - Added the soy at when the mushrooms were near cooked (last minute or two)  Additions: - Using the same olive oil in the mushroom skillet, added 1 medium red onion cut into thin rounds and saut\u00e9ed. Okay to stir. - Used multigrain thin bread bun thins (Earthgrains 100% Multigrain Thin Buns are really good - can be found in any grocery store, Nature's own multigrain sandwich rounds are great too, Dempster's Thinfuls are available in Canada, but not as healthy at the others) - Used baby spinach leaves instead of lettuce on the buns - Added a few hot peppers to top off the burger for a little kick  Amazing - will be making more often",
