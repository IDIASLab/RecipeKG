Unfortunately there were no racks at the supermarket so I made do with some very nice lamb chops instead. The marinade was simple and a very bright tasting barbecue sauce. The cooking instructions were way off for the onion lollipops though. I should have listened to my own cooking instincts and cooked them over INDIRECT heat for the stated time. My first batch of onions burned within five minutes of hitting the grill. Easily put more together and made a new batch.I had to adjust the cooking time for medium rare chops too. All in all a good barbecues lamb recipe. I would like to try this with a boneless leg of lamb on the rotisserie some time. Thanks for the tasty recipe.",

I normally have made lamb, in the oven.  This is the best lamb recipe I have used and it came out PERFECT.  Wasn't the least bit oily or greasy.  The meat was flavorful and the marinade & BBQ took the \"weird taste\" and odor, I have had with lamb.  With the 10 minute wait, to let it rest.  I was preparing additional vegetables, in parallel and everything came together in the end.",
