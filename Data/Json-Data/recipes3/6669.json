I used about 1/2 cup of chopped green olives as 1 Tbls didn't seem near enough to me. There really wasn't anything to simmer the rabbit & thighs in so I added some sherry to each of the pans and it added a lovely flavor. Definitely needs some type of liquid here. I also used a can of artichoke hearts in place of fresh baby artichokes. The potatoes were great as well. We thoroughly enjoyed this dinner and will make it again.",

Our rabbit did not produce enough juice to simmer for as long as the recipe recommends (our rabbit was very lean) so I added a little bit of water to it. Everything else followed to the letter.
