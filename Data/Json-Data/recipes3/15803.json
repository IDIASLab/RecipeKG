Didn't have garlic salt so substituted 1 teaspoon of salt and garlic powder which may have made it a little salty for my taste will cut salt in half next time. Dough is really sticky. I used a pastry scraper to help with the kneading and olive oil on the hands when forming the bagels. May be my oven but I had to bake them a little longer to get the golden brown color. Will make again and experiment with different herbs and spices...maybe even a sweet version. Thanks for this recipe....a winner.",

This particular recipe was too salty for me. These really don't make good bagels though. They don't toast up well and stay soggy/wet in the middle from all the cheese in them. They make decent sandwiches and can be used in other recipes such as pizza etc. I enjoyed trying the recipe. Thanks!",
