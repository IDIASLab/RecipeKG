I am a novice at mexican-inspired cooking but this chicken tasted exactly like a friend's homemade chicken enchiladas-yum! i too decreased the mustard to about 1/8 cup in the marinade-- and added more (about double) of all ingredients to sauce while boiling it and we STILL didn't have enough sauce for our 3 chicken breasts. next time i will make even more sauce it was really the star of the whole meal. I used a medium salsa and it had just the right amount of heat. Topped with sour cream which was just perfect to counter the heat-- no lime garnish they had all been squeezed into the sauce by that point. served with yellow rice and a black bean and corn salad. great easy recipe! thanks!",

Then I marinated 3 chicken breasts in the frig for about 4 hours. I cooked the chicken with the marinade right in the frying pan and I used olive oil instead of butter. Finally I added chicken broth as needed during the cooking time and it came out deliciously moist. Definitely a keeper!",

Here's what I did: I marinated the chicken according to the recipe. Then instead of following all the complications of boiling the marinade etc I simply mixed up more marinade warmed it in a separate pan from the chicken and poured it one top of the chicken before serving. I also used sour cream instead of yogurt and LOVED it! My husband and I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers. Goes GREAT with Mexican Rice III from this site.",

Pairing dijon mustard with salsa is odd. Something like an onion mustard would be better. And use only about 1 tablespoon instead of a 1/4 of cup. That is alot of mustard. Yogurt doesn't really go with this recipe. Yogurt is usually used to tame the hit in a dish such as a spicy curry so it would tame the heat of a spicy salsa but use a good Mexican sour cream instead.",
