I added the OJ and pomegranate juice and I agree with the first reviewer in that the OJ dominated. I added more pomegranate juice and let it cook down and served with some fresh pomegranate seeds that I had on hand (so we really DID taste the pomegranate flavor). If I were to make again I d DECREASE the OJ by 50% and INCREASE the pomegranate juice by 50%. It was a totally different and new flavor for carrots. Katie thanks for sharing.",
