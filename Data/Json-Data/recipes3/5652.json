Loved, loved, loved it, particularly with the big shrimp. I think they probably worked out better as they take a little longer to cook, and so wouldn't get overcooked in the process. I didn't have cognac so substituted dry sherry, and because I love them, I added capers to the mix. Also, just because I had some on hand, I threw in a handful of grape tomatoes right toward the end. That way they just warmed and didn't pop from the heat. I served it over egg noodles. Thanks for the great take on shrimp!",
