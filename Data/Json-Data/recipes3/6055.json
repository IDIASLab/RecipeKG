The key to is to let the oil drip VERY VERY slowly in order for the emulsification process to take place. I pour it into the \"pusher\" attachtment (it has a small hole at the bottom)of my food processor. Unlike vinaigrette homemade mayo should not separate if made correctly. It \"sets up\" nicely if you use this process (SEE MY PHOTO). Thank you for the recipe! UPDATE: For those of you who do not have a hole in your pusher simply poke a small hole on the bottom of paper cup. Place the cup hole facing the feeder and pour the oil into the paper cup. This way the oil will dribble which is an essential step in ensuring homemade mayo to \"set up\".",

EITHER WILL MAKE EGG CHANGE CHEMISTRY SO IT ABSORBS MORE OIL. I USE TABASCO INSTEAD OF BLACK PEPPER AND THE MIXER RUINS MAYO HAND WHISK IS SLOWER AND WON'T BREAK THE EGGS. MY ARMS ARE USED TO THE WHISK...DIDN'T REMEMBER THE EGG/OIL RATIO THAT'S WHY I SEARCHED FOR THIS RECIPE. I JUST LIKE HOMEADE STUFF BETTER THAN SPENDING MORE AND BUYING STOREBOUGHT. FRESHER. YOU SHOULDN'T REFRIGERATE THE MAYO FOR 8 HOURS TOO HAS TO FINISH SETTING UP BEFORE REFRIGERATING IT. HOPE THESE TIPS ARE USEFUL. THANK-YOU SO MUCH FOR A GREAT RECIPE IN MY CASE JUST THE MAYO.",

I suggest investing in a good smoked salmon from the grocery store because this appy really is delicious if done properly. I did not make my own mayo; Hellmans works just fine for me. I also added some herbs and spices to the salmon/egg mixture including dill. Lovely appetizer and thank you!",
