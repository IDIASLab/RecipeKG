Flavor was awesome but the texture wasn t the best so I d suggest you not use a pear that s overly ripe like I did. Also you may want to cut back a bit on the time that you bake the crostini because it crisps up very quickly once it s under the broiler so you could end up with something that tastes like a cracker. The ingredients are harmonious and I wouldn t hesitate to serve this to company. KerriJ thanks for sharing your recipe.",

The directions in the recipe do not equate to caramelized onions as it states in the title of the dish. The taste is great. I think next time I may make a balsamic reduction to drizzle on the final product. Thanks for sharing your recipe it is really good!",
