There is no oil in this recipe (not sure if that's intentional), but I used about 1 tbsp to brown the chops and then added a bit more once I added the onions and garlic since the pan was a bit dry. I used diced tomatoes as those are easier to work with than whole tomatoes.  1 tablespoon of rosemary seemed like a lot, so I halved that and it was plenty. The only other thing I would suggest is if you don't tolerate spicy foods very well, to cut back on the red pepper flakes.  As suggested, I can see the sauce being delicious on pasta, but I served mine with veggies. YUM!",
