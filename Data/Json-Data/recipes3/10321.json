(a great way to use up those partial bags of frozen veggies) I don't buy canned carrots so I used 3 fresh carrots diced and sauteed with the onion. (some diced celery would be a good addition to this too - next time) The method is fine as written or you can make the sauce and add everything to the sauce pan stir it up and then into the pie shell.

First I used fresh green beans and carrots and frozen corn instead of canned and added chopped celery and minced garlic. Also I prebaked the bottom crust about 5 minutes to make sure it would cook thoroughly and not get too soggy. Finally I just cooked everything in one pot before pouring it into the crust instead of adding the chicken and veggies to the crust and then pouring the liquid over them. I disagree with another reviewer about it being dry; it could've been because of my slight changes but my husband and I thought the amount of gravy was perfect!",
