                "reviewBody": "Boiling works fine, but you can really punch this up with a smoky flavor by roasting the peppers and even the tomatoes on the grill until the skins turns brown and is easy to remove. (Just cut a small X on the bottom of the tomato to help the skin slide off.) After roasting the skins, just place the veggies in a paper bag and let them steam for a bit, then remove the skins with a paper towel. I always use gloves to skin the peppers! Here in Tucson, AZ, chiles and peppers are plentiful and can be super-hot! You can knock back the heat by removing the membranes and seeds from the jalapenos, just use the flesh. My blender/processor does not like cilantro unless its been pretty chopped up first; the stems tend to just go 'round in circles and never chop up. \nI only add 1/2 lime, increase garlic to 5 bulbs (but we LOVE garlic!) and to make a more authentic verde flavor, I add roasted green chiles, skinned and seeded, with a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. Finally, let it sit in the refrigerator for an hour, then taste...you may want more lime at that point. Since there are many natural variables that will affect the heat of this basic salsa, be ready to punch up the heat with 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne or knock it down with sour cream, greek yogurt or even avocado. This is a great basic recipe that you can make your own! Keep covered in the refrigerator, and watch out...it can get hotter the longer it sits. Thanks, Trey!",

We just put all the peppers and tomatoes right on a charcoal grill and flipped them around until they were dark all over. We skinned the tomatoes but not the jalapenos. I do think this recipe could use more garlic - we doubled the garlic and roasted it but still could have used more. I used yellow onions because that's all we had on hand. My husband thinks this is the best salsa he's ever had and it was so easy to make in the food processor!",

I'm freezing some in ice cube trays to put in chili once the weather cools down I know it'll be the perfect addition. Great recipe with tons of uses!",
