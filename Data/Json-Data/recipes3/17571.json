I think this really needs onions and perhaps a touch of garlic with plenty of black pepper too. I would also prefer a more veggies...corn and broccoli would be a good start for me. It's a good base recipe and I would make again with changes to suit our preferences. I also would omit the chicken base i think...not really crazy about that flavor. Thanks for the idea!",
