I always use Peas, carrots, and onions for my veggies. And whatever meat i have on hand.. Diced ham is always good, or shrimp. chicken, Or whatever meat you have left over, and eggs of course. It always turns out best if the rice is @ room temp. when cooking.Prevents it from getting mooshy on you. Even letting the rice set overnight.I always use a lil bit of soy sauce and salt as well.I have experimented with diff. grains of rice. I find that the short sticky rice, set at room temp. works the best. Unless you like the \"fall apart\" type of fried rice, then use long grain. The choice is yours :)Have fun",

It takes quite a while, and you may have to add more butter. Using white rice that has been refridgerated for 24 hours is key! Also, we used 4 eggs, 'cause we like them. I mixed them up in a bowl and poured them directly over the rice during the end of cooking/frying. Perfect! My brother is from NYC and said it was just as good as any take out in the city!!!!!",
