The batter doesn t pour it needs to be scooped and mine didn t rise at all so don t be alarmed if yours doesn t either.

Thanks to Allrecipes \"this but not that\" ingredient search. That being said,I also subbed a second  cup of unsweetened apple sauce instead of the  pumpkin and vegetable oil instead of coconut oil and honey in place of agave. Don't you hate it when people make so many changes? But for real - these are excellent even with my changes.  They are not sweet, but pleasantly muffiny and hubs can drizzle maple syrup on them and be happy. Thanks Laura!",
