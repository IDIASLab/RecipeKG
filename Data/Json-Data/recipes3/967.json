After hearing the comments from people eating it, those who didn't get a slice were begging for a taste! I did make a few changes. First, I added a quarter cup of white sugar to the crust. Next I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. Then I also used 1 1/3 cups of milk as others suggested. Finally, I topped the whipped cream with mini chocolate morsels. Super easy and scrumptious.",

I used a combo of pecans and cashews in my crust (didn't have enough pecans) and added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar. Baked my crust for about 20 mins perfect! I used light cream cheese fat free Cool Whip and fat free pudding mix (like any of it matters!!). I do believe that 2/3 cup of milk is a typo in this recipe...the box directions are 2 cups but I think it depends how thick you want your pudding layer to be within this pie. I used about 1 1/2 cups of milk and found it perfect! Decorated the top with semi-sweet chocolate shavings just beautiful! Five stars plus and a repeat for sure!",
