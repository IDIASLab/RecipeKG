However I sort of wish I would have just stayed skeptical and left it at that lol. It was such a mess to make! Coating raw chicken in honey is harder than you might think. Especially boneless skinless chicken breasts. The honey just isn't very cooperative. Then cooking it. Well...you have to be SUPER careful not to cook it even a minute too long or it definitely WILL burn. I had 3 pieces that didn't and 2 that did. The ones that didn't burn were still just a strange texture. The flavor really is nice but carmelized honey is chewy. Not the most pleasant texture for chicken. I think the ingredients DO taste well together but I don't know the frying is just probably not the route to take. I may try oven frying it sometime or baking it to see if it works out better that way..If I feel the need to go through the mess of preparing it again!:",

Just as you said the honey DID caramelize and my friend thought I was burning it but I reassured him that I wasn't. There was hardly any mess (besides my fingers!) as I used a bowl to douse the chicken in honey and then moved it over to my other bowl with the seasonings and flour. Immediately after that I transferred the chicken to the frying pan to prevent any problems with dripping (like people have said they had problems with). Just make sure your chicken is DRY before putting the honey and flour mixture on it. The coating stayed on the chicken the whole time while cooking and I turned it several times while cooking to prevent any burning (yes honey WILL burn if you keep it on the pan too long my mom taught me that years ago). I put extra honey on the chicken when it was done to add a nice gloss as well as a bit more flavor which was perfect. I didn't offer any dipping sauce as I also made mashed potatoes & gravy using the leftover grease for the gravy. I also added a little bit of honey to the gravy which made it an awesome compliment to the chicken which was wonderful! I will remember this recipe and definitely make it again someday! Thanks for adding this!",
