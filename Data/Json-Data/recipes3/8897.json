Also I recommend 3-6 pinches of sugar to balance it out the acids from the tomatoes. It makes a big difference.Don't overdo it though. Lastly- make sure the canned tomatoes are of high quality. Pastene brand Italian tomatoes are my favorite. In the North End in Boston the owner of my favorite restaurant said \"It's all about the tomatoes\".",

I used 1 pinch of pepper (recipe doesn't specify) along with the 1 pinch of salt. I must say this is the best pizza sauce I have made to date. It was even a little better the next day probably because the flavors were able to fully mix overnight. This is now my go to recipe for pizza sauce.",
