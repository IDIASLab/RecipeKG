I mixed the the stock salt garlic lemon capers and olive oil in a zip top bag and added the chicken. I used Tyson's frozen thawed boneless skinless chicken breast since that's what I had on hand. I let it marinade for about 3 hours. I then removed the chicken from the marinade and browned in a cast iron skillet. Added the marinade and peppers to the same pan. Since the reviews commented on over baked chicken I set my oven to 350 degrees knowing that my cast iron pan was hot and holds heat well during baking. I baked for 20 minutes before checking. It was well done and dry. I wish I would have checked it at 15 minutes. I am not sure why the recipe states 40 - 45 minutes cook time as that is way too long for this recipe. The chicken was full of flavor.",

It was OK but didn t have as much flavor as I anticipated. With the lemon juice and capers I was thinking the first thing that would hit me would be a resemblance to chicken piccata but that flavor just really didn t kick in. Served with rice steamed carrots tossed salad and hot baguette. Not bad had nice presentation but simply not as good as I would have liked.",

I used 5.5 - 6 oz breasts and mine were already done at at 22 minutes so check before then! Use a thermometer to ensure doneness. The chicken could use a bit more flavor so if I make this again I will marinate the chicken in the lemon/stock/garlic/caper mixture first then pat the chicken off and sear in a pan before placing it into the baking dish with the liquid mixture. An otherwise healthy and colorful dish. I served this over a rice/quinoa mixture and it was wonderful drizzled with the liquid.",

Mine was done in a little under 20 but the veggies could have used more time. I think I would make the whole thing on the stove top next time. Sear the chicken and remove it. Add all the veggies and caramelize and then add the stock and the chicken back to the pan to finish cooking. It's a great combination of flavors but I'd totally change the method next time. I did make a pan sauce while the chicken finished cooking (because I cannot waste those delicious brown bits in the pan). I just deglazed the pan with a little white wine and then added some chicken stock and reduced it! It was nice and helped finish the dish.",
