I did make a few changes because the mustard was strong and I always add more seasoning to all my recipes. For the wet mix I used the Dijon mustard & garlic but I also put about 1 1/2- 2 Tbl of honey in the mix to make it a little sweeter. For the dry mix I used the oil but I don t think it s necessary so I will omit it next time. I added garlic powder onion powder and a little parmesan cheese to the dry mix. I baked the chicken on a cookie sheet wrapped in foil for easy clean up on 425 for the same amount of time (approx 12 mins).",
