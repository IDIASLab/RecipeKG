You might know what Puerto Rican sofrito is but are obviously unaware of Cuban cooking and that version of sofrito. This recipe is very close to what could be called a standard recipe for CUBAN sofrito - as the recipe author stated.  True Cuban sofrito is cooked in extra virgon olive oil. Puerto Ricans tend to make sofrito like a salsa puree and then cook it later, Cubans tend to make it chunkier and cook it right when it is made.  Before you berate a recipe and its author you ought to be sure you know what you are talking about, and if you don't know for sure then keep quiet.",

I wasn't thrilled about the vague instructions. I did get a \"yummy\" green paste after cooking the vegetables for quite a while. I would suggest mincing the onion garlic and bell pepper as finely as possible. I also I had to add water from time to time to keep the mixture from burning on my pan. If using fresh tomato I would suggest peeling it first. Turns out 3/4 cup of tomato sauce is pretty much one of the small 8oz cans. Again \"really red\" is a vague description of color. I cooked the sauce until it was a rich red color with no more appearance of green. In the process of doing this I added about 2 tbs red wine and 1/4 beef bullion broth when the sauce got too thick. I used this sauce to make a casserole using sliced red potatoes and ground pork. The family loved it. Next time I'm putting it in the crock pot with pot roast and potatoes. Despite the hard to follow instructions the flavors and spices of this sauce were very appealing. It's a keeper.",
