Opened up the garlic and sprinkled it over all the wings. Then when I added the spice mixture the rosemary and garlic mixed into the wings more. I believe this gave the dish more flavor. I baked them 20 min on one side took them out and turned them then baked another 20 minutes on the other side. Instead of broiling them I grilled them one by one on the grill. They came out really well. I think the grilling really sealed in the flavor. Thanks for the recipe!",
