I love adding pine nuts or walnuts to pesto, but the amounts called for were too much, it competed with the basil flavor.  Also, the combination of both butter and olive oil made it way to heavy/greasy for my taste.  I did like the idea of adding two cheeses, I will probably try that with one of the other recipes from this site, but I won't make this one again.",

Also before placing the pine nuts and walnuts in the processor I placed them in one layer on a baking sheet in the oven for 5 minutes on 350. It gets their oils going and a more nuttier flavor which I find to be the great kick in pesto.",
