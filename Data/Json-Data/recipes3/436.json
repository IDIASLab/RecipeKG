(for me that's saying something since I can't seem to cook dessert to save my life including boxed) I followed the recipe to a tee adding the coconut into the mix since my family all LOVE the stuff..(num) The only ingrediant I didn't have was the veggie oil which I subbed for canola. It left a slight after taste that wasn't entirely pleasent in the uncooked batter and I was pretty worried. Fortunately in the finished product the aftertaste was barely noticable. For the topping I added two drops of green food coloring just to give it that added springy look to it and sprinkled more coconut across the top. For the most part I was really pleased with the results. The reason I'm giving it three stars is because for some reason the cake solidified fine in the oven with the exception to one of the sides which bubbled over the rim. I have NO idea why it did this it could just be my oven however I had too work around the mess it created and also cook the cake 10 minutes longer then the recipe called for because it was no where near done at that point. So the end result was that a small portion of the cake was harder along the rim while the rest of it turned out great. But that's okay I'm just glad it's edible at all.:) Anyway it's very sweet and my husband likes this very much so thank you for the recipe.",
