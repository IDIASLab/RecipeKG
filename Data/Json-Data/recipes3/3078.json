However these ingrediants don't seem to be 'to scale.' I suggest using a little leftover bacon grease to cook the onions in and possibly an extra can of broken up stewed tomatoes (if you cook it the way its listed it will be very dry.) Also I heat the pasta after its mixed for a few minutes (while stirring) so that it absorbs all of the flavor. (The way I make it has it turn out a little greasy but the flavor more than makes up for it.)",

I entered pasta tomato cheese and bacon in ingredients and this recipe came up. I'm glad it did! It was really good. It true that it looks dry at first but it is perfect when you mix it with the pastas. After reading the reviews I did this: I put in 7 slices of bacon which I cut in 1 inch slices before cooking them. After removing the bacon I cooked the onions and garlic in the bacon fat. Since I didn't have a can of tomatoes I used 3 fresh tomatoes removed the skin and diced them. I don't like parmesan cheese so I put in 1/2 cup of mozzarella which I mixed in with the pastas and sauce before serving. I used rotini pastas. I will make it the same way again and have a bowl of freshly grated parmesan cheese available for those who like it. This is now a favorite. Thanks Catherine.",
