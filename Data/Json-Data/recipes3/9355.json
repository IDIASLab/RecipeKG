The florets cook to perfection when just dipped in the batter and fried - also, the batter sticks more easily to the uncooked pieces.  Want to save more time? The use of the food processor to make the batter is overkill as far as dishes and equipment go (or maybe I am just lazy).  Just whip it up in a bowl (the same one you will use to dip the florets in).  So save yourself the hassle of step 1 and part of step 2 and make this tasty recipe.",

Beautiful color, just a bit snappy on the inside for a nice crunch, great flavor. Def. a winner with the kids.",
