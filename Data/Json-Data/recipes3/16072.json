If you already have other foods going in your smoker at a higher temp, throw the corn in - just reduce the time slightly. I like using maple or fruit woods, but for a smokier flavor, use hickory or mesquite.",

With the flavors of the smoke (I used maple wood) pairing well with the buttery cinnamon and bourbon flavors it provided a delicious taste that was enjoyed by everyone. This is a great alternative to the corn and plain butter that gets repeated all summer long at barbecues. This is going to be a new summer staple for my parties. I will be having this again!",
