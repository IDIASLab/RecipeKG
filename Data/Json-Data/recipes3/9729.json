I used a whole 8oz. pkg, of sliced mushrooms (I used baby bella), 4oz. cream cheese and only used part of the other cup of heavy cream (just enough to thin the sauce out a bit). I guess you could just say that I halved the sauce. The sauce was so good that I was afraid to ruin it by adding the egg, so I omitted it, lol. It was still plenty for 1# of pasta. This had a really great flavor, and I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
