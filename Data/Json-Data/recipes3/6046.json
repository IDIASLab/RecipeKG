Used baby swiss deli slices (cut finely) along with 1 oz of Mozarrella (cut finely) & some soft Muenster cheese (maybe 1/2 oz or less) (scaled down to two servings. I actually didn't have any milk so I just used a small amount of whipping cream and watered it down a tad. I ended up just mixing the whole thing up instead of layering it. Also added a small amount of finely chopped capers and green olives stuffed with pimentos (no more than 1/4 oz) and a small amount of garlic salt (1/8 tsp approximately). I usually try to make things as called for fot the first time around but since I was out of the milk and didn't quite have enough artichokes I thought what the heck! This dip turned out absolutely fantastic!",
