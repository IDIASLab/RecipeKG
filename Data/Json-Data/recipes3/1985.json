I made these and iced them with the new Whipped frosting from a can (which was really quick and easy) for Valentines Day and took them to the office. They were a huge hit! I was told You have to make these again. I also made them for my picky boyfriend who only likes really plain vanilla type cookies and he enjoyed them too. Will definately make these again and again! Just be sure you chill the dough really well before making the cut-outs. Thanks for the great recipe!",
