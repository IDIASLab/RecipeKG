You would be better off substituting softened butter as that's what heavy whipping cream is after a heavy whipping, lol. Or possibly a creme fraiche or sour cream.

HELPFUL HINTS:  Heavy whipping cream is NOT cool whip which changes the complexity of the salad.  ADDITIONS:  For a different salad built on the recipe base, try adding cranraisins, chives, pecans, candied cashews (found at Trader Joes) and/or cayenne pepper.  Also, curry is a nice spice to add to give the salad different character.  A crowd pleaser to be sure!",

But, I took a chance and made it for a friend's baby shower.  Even while I was mixing it I was cringing and afraid...old opinions die hard...grapes and mayo...yuck!   \r\n\r\nAnyway, I have no regrets.  Wonderful recipe that I got many compliments on.  The grapes were awesome with the other ingredients; they fit right in and were delicious.  It's a lot of work to make fresh chicken salad, but when I make it again, this is the recipe I'll use.  \r\n\r\nSo if you are a traditionalist, like me, go ahead and try something different.  I bet you will be pleasantly surprised and expand your food horizons!\r\n\r\nOne more thing, I used pecans instead of almonds...really I think any nut you have on hand would work as well.",

I tripled it and added more grapes, 2 apples, walnuts in stead of almonds b/c I was having them in my salad, onion and salt to taste, and cayenne to taste...needed some kick and this did the trick. I used Miracle Whip and Cool Whip...no mayo. Sunday, I added a little more Mir. Whip and Cool Whip, to moisten.  I served it on croissants w/leaf lettuce, that I made up about 3 hours ahead, and covered tightly w/ Saran Wrap and put in frig. Croissants also held up well in frig.  Very easy -- and \"make ahead\" friendly.  Actually better if it sits overnight!!!!!  Will DEFINATELY make again!!!!!",

I did some of the other suggestions from the other folks who tried the recipe.  Used walnuts instead, used some granny smith apple too, little pickle relish, cayenne, fresh ground pepper and sea salt to taste.  I cut back on the mayo and added chopped green onion.

I was DEFINITELY one of those irritating reviewers who made a zillion changes and then gave the recipe fewer stars. My apologies! I have learned SO much about food since then. I now realize I should have used heavy whipping cream as written and avoided canned chunk chicken. I promise to give this another try w/ the correct recipe;-) I was really excited about this recipe but ended up slightly disappointed. I used canned chunk chicken and realized after the fact that I should have then omitted the salt. It was definitely too salty. I used light mayo and cool whip which was a nice combo. The salad was a little bland though. However I probably will add almonds and coolwhip to my future chicken salads!",
