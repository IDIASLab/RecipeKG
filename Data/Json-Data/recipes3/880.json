I suggest making it earlier in the day if you are serving it for dinner. The flavor is very simple. I served it on top of lettuce that was tossed with balsamic vinaigrette. If you eat it plain you may want to season it up. I sprinkled Emeril s Original essence on top of it when I ate it the next day.",
