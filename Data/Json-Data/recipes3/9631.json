The wine chili and currant jelly mixed together very well and created a very flavorful sauce. Just a quick note we ended up with a LOT of cause left over after cooking 6 whole breasts. You should make the sauce using half the ingredients listed.",

My only concern was the cooking time and that the chicken would end up too dry. To fix this I put the oven at 400 baked the chicken for 20 minutes pulled it out and added the sauce (spooning currents on top of chicken for very nice effect!) and put it back in for another 15 minutes. YUM! Very moist. Thanks for the awesome recipe...it is now a permanent fixture for my winter rotation.",
