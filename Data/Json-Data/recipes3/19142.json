It was a good idea because my bread came out perfectly rounded dome thin crunchy browned crust and a wonderfully soft firm textured bread that was easy to slice (even very thin). I mixed it up in my much loved Kitchen Aid mixer and baked it at 350 for 45min. Here are the adjustments I made: Proofed 1 pkg. active yeast in cup warm water mixed with 1 tbl sugar. Reduced buttermilk to 1 cup (actually 1 tbl. Apple cider vinegar milk to make 1 cup) let sit for at least 15 min. then added the baking soda. Mixed flours with salt and took out 1 cup Added buttermilk substitute and yeast mixture to dry ingredients in mixer and added the reserved 1 cup flour slowly. Mixture was very sticky so I added cup white flour and even though it was still a bit sticky left it like that. Put dough in oiled bowl. Turned on oven for 1 min turned off and put bowl covered loosely with plastic wrap in for 1 hr. Punched down and rolled into rectangle and rolled up tightly into log. Placed into greased bread pan and let rise in oven again for 1hr.; baked for 45min. Perfection!! Don t be tempted to add more flour will produce crumbly or dry bread.",

It raises nicely, is very moist, and isn't heavy and compact like most whole wheat breads.  I have done it both times completly in my bread maker which is one of the less expensive ones.  I did follow a couple of the other reviewers advise.  Use bread flour and not all purpose. Added almost another cup of whole wheat flour than the recipe calls for. I never have buttermilk so added 1 Tablespoon apple cider vinegar to regular milk and mixed the baking soda, oil, and honey with it.  Put that in the bread maker first.  I also mix the whole wheat flour, the bread flour, and salt in a bowl to combine well before dumping it in the bread maker on top of the liquid ingredients.  Put a pat of butter in each corner of the bread pan.  Set bread maker to basic/specialty setting with a crust color set for medium.  You couldn't ask for a nicer loaf of bread.  Will be making this often.",

I use an Oster bread machine; therefore I did use white bread flour and added 1/3 cup more whole wheat flour than called for in recipe cause I thought it was a bit too moist at kneading. Used \"White\" and \"Rapid\" \"Medium Crust\" settings. For those having problems I might suggest that you add the baking soda directly to the buttermilk as you measure it as opposed to adding it with the dry ingredients.",

I agree that it makes an enormous loaf so I'd reduce the buttermilk to 1 c. and the soda as well. For those who had failures are you using bread flour? It's critical to use bread flour with a high protein content to get a good rise in any bread. Compare protein content between brands. In the Midwest Dakota Maid bread flour is the best. Hope this helps.",

After seeing the high ratings I was really excited to find a great whole wheat bread recipe but I guess I should have READ the reviews and taken the advice of adding more flour from the start! My dough was more like batter which made it really hard to get out of the breadmaker and into my loaf pan! The flavor was okay but \"nothing to write home about\" as my father would put it. I expected a really rich wheaty honey flavor. I ended up throwing out the rest of the loaf after dinner.",
