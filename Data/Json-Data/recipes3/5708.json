I recently made this recipe again as a side dish for my parents 50th wedding anniversary party. We had about 70 guests 90% of whom were German immigrants. We served these dumplings as a side dish with traditional German rouladen. We got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. Thank you! As I mentioned previously I did add fried bacon to the recipe. I had to multiply the recipe by 8 and made them in 2 batches. I flash froze them on a cookie sheet and then put them in freezer bags until the party. They defrosted wonderfully and only needed a quick reheating before serving. I still have about 2 dozen left in the freezer and can't wait to serve them again.",
