Made this recipe with coconut oil instead of olive oil. It was too thin for dipping when made but firmed up overnight in the fridge. Wonderful consistency for dipping the next day. Just the right amount of heat and a nice contrast with cold celery sticks. This recipe as written would make a great soup with just a few additions (i.e. cream and some smoked gouda or sweetened coconut milk). Going to make a bigger batch today and keep this in the fridge for snack attacks. On HCG 2.0 diet the fat calories are zeroed out by coconut oil. This is an excellent snack. Thanks for sharing this scrumptious recipe.",
