I was concerned that there was no sugar but I figured the submitter left it out on purpose.  Based on other reviews, I decided to split the batch between 2 8x8 glass dishes.  One batch was made exactly as instructed, the other had 1/3c sugar added to it.  The sugar batch was sweet, the original was a little more mellow.  The golden raisins gave so much sweetness it really makes up for the lack of sugar.  Both ways taste great but next time I think I'll add maybe 1/2c sugar to the whole batch.  The pic is of the original version, no sugar added. ",
