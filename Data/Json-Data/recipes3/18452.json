I left out the optional mushrooms because once again mushrooms don't belong in fajitas. I added 2 tablespoons of my homemade fajita seasoning when I added the chicken and then ended up adding some cumin. They sell fajita seasoning in envelopes. Even taco seasoning would work. As written this would have been bland in my opinion but I\"m still giving it 4 stars because with one additional ingredient added they are great. The leftovers help up pretty good too considering they were fried.",
