I mixed up 6 eggs milk and some additional sugar and cinnamon I added stuffing until the mixture was well saturated and still had a little egg liquid to it. I then put it in a Bunt cake pan (just to make it pretty but you could put it in anything) and put it in a 350 degree oven for about 40 min. But I really just needed to keep checking it until the egg mixture was all cooked through. You can then dust the top with some powdered sugar and maybe some dried cranberries for a nice presentation. My guests ate it with butter and maple syrup and I also had one guest that ate it spread with light cream cheese (for a less sweet option) With all the egg in it this bunt cake stretch very far when served with some bacon and fruit for a very nice post Thanksgiving breakfast. I served 6 adults and still had a few slices left over. My guests liked the stuffing this way better than they did for the Thanksgiving dinner. For dinner they missed the more traditional stuffing that we usually serve.",

I always use an extra touch of butter and last year I threw some rosemary and poultry seasoning into the mix. Worked wonderfully. The apple cider is always a good call. So are the raisins. Highly recommended especially for vegetarians and anyone willing to try something a little unconventional.",
