I also added a bit of parmesan cheese along with the cream and the sauce came out very smooth and oh so good over the penne pasta. Great with garlic bread!",

The idea of using whole peeled tomatos in this recipe is a good one, however that's the only thing I would do again from this recipe.  There is entirely too much heavy cream used in this recipe.  The flavor of the tomatos and the spices was great, but once the heavy cream was added this sauce suddenly became very bland.  Not only was the sauce bland, but it was very thin.  My recommendation would be to cut the heavy cream in half.",

With the alterations I made, it was closer to another 5-star recipe on this site, \"Penne with Spicy Vodka Tomato Cream Sauce\", with no meat.  I recommend using red pepper flakes, 3/4t. salt, crushed or diced tomatoes (vs. whole) and less cream.  I added sliced, fresh mushrooms halfway through - oh yum!  Adding the red pepper with some salt will eliminate the blandness that other reviewers mentioned.  I will make this again with those changes.",
