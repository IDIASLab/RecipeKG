As others have, I used the full can of sweetened condensed milk which worked out just fine. And for extra chocolatiness, I used a dark chocolate cake mix.  It would be easy and tempting to overbake these, as after the recommended baking time they still were a little jiggly in the pan. I resisted the temptation to bake them longer and I was glad I did--they set up perfectly as they cooled. My only criticism is that these were a little on the greasy side.  Perhaps using the full can of milk rather than the 2/3 c. called for is responsible. Otherwise, I think I'd reduce the butter to 1/2 c. rather than 3/4 c. A creative and easy twist on a boxed cake mix.  ",

When I mixed the cake mix milk and butter together I assumed a 9x13 pan was too large. BOY was I wrong. I can't stress this enough....USE the 9x13 pan nothing smaller. The second and third changes were great though instead of using snickers I used milky way and I added pecans. Great!!! My co-workers love it.",

It was a great combination. The brownies came out chewey and delicious. I took them to a 4th of July barbecue and brought some to work today. Both groups loved them. I'm going to try them with different combinations of candy bars now. A definite keeper for me. Thanks! I just made these again and used other reader's suggestions of using a 1/2 cup butter and almost a whole can of condensed milk and I baked it in mini muffin cups. Also I didn't bake the first layer first...just baked it all at once. The little cups turned out really cute but the only thing was that when I took them out of the oven they fell and had a large dip in the middle. I ended up putting a mini scoop of ice cream in the middle of the brownie cup and swirling some caramel sauce on top. It looked realy pretty.",

They closed a few years ago and I still get cravings for theirs! I have searched the internet for a similar recipe and I have to say that these come very very close (theirs might have been a bit more fudgey). I did have trouble putting the second layer on top so I ended up just dropping the batter by the spoonfuls. I was a little worried that there would not be enough batter or that it was too thinly spread...but it rose up nicely in the oven. Perfection! Thanks for much for posting this recipe. PS My husband has eaten 1/2 a pan already and I was going to take these to school for a luncheon...I guess I will have to make another batch. Oh I used mini-Snickers instead of the full-sized.",

I am a chocolate lover and a snickers lover (and a butter lover!) so I thought these would be perfect. They were WAY WAY too oily. I had to let them sit on papertowels before plating them to absorb the butter and they even soaked through that. My counters look like an oil slick! I also made them late at night for a function the following day. They didn't survive. By the next day at 6 am they were crumbly and hard (yet still strangely greasy).
