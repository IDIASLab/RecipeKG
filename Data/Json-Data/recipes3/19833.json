To the sauce I added 1/2 pint of sour cream 2 cloves of minced garlic 1 tsp fresh ground pepper 2 tbls of creamy horseradish sauce and fresh mushrooms sauteed in butter (just enough to shed some water). Put everything in a slow cooker set on three for 4 hours (Certainly doesn't have to cook that long it was just easier that way. I put everything together over lunch so it would be ready for dinner). Served over egg noodles along with French Bread & Ceaser Salad. These were the best Swedish Meatballs I've ever had. (That's saying something from a guy who grew up on the Iron Range of Northern MN.) Thanks Jessica & Marla. PS: I've got the combined recipies along with my additions saved on my computer. If the original people don't mind I'll post it as a new recipe under JMJ's (Jessica Marla & Jimmy's) Swedish Meatballs.",

I baked the meatballs breifly and then threw everything in the crockpot and it was the BEST swedish meatball recipe I have every fixed. Adding some of the juice from the mushrooms made this sauce a very nice consistency. Will make this again",

I will definitely make this again. Baking in the sauce gives the meatballs a lot of flavor.",

I then drained them on paper towels placed them in an 8x8\" dish and prepared the sauce in the same frying pan (after draining the grease). I sauteed a small can of mushrooms in a little butter then combined with the cans of soup and two small cans (5 oz each) of evaporated milk. Next time I'm going to use two cans of mushroom soup as the chicken soup added a not-so-great sweetness to it. And I'll probably only use 5 oz of evaporated milk and add a half-cup or so of sour cream. We served it over egg noodles and it was good... But I think it'll be much better with the changes I want to use. Thanks Jessica for a great starting point.:)",
