The only thing I did differently was use up 4 slices of swiss cheese(two on the bottom layer and two in the egg mixture)and used sandwich ham meat, cut up which I combined with the egg mixture as well.  The pie crust didn't really cook thoroughly, I'm not sure if it's because I didn't cook it long enough (45 mins), but it turned soggy, so we just ate the filling.  I think next time, we'll prebake the pie crust and then fill it.  Another thing I'd do differently is instead of layer the swiss on the bottom, I'll just combine it all with the eggs and then use about 1/4 cup of the egg on the bottom layer and then add ham to the egg mixture and top it off with that.  Other than that, it's perfect.",

I also used evaporated milk instead of half & half and doubled the swiss cheese. For another tasty variety, substitute 1 broccoli crown for the spinach and omit the mushrooms. MMMMMM... I made two of these, and it is even better the second day!  The pies were a little soft the first day, but they firmed up nicely overnight. This is the first quiche I've ever made, and this recipe is definately a keeper!",

It's so quick and easy too, especially if you buy Swiss cheese and Cheddar cheese that is already sliced and shredded.  A cute idea for gatherings is to make miniature pies for everyone. One 9\" pie recipe is equivilant to about 12 miniature pies.  I baked 24 miniature pies for 45 minutes and they came out perfect.  This recipe is a real winner, and I know I'll keep making it for years to come!",
