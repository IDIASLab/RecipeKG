I just hate to see lonely recipes. Maybe the bacon fat scared people off but my feeling is that most of the time I cook heart healty meals so once in a while you can splurge. Like Emeril always says \"Pork fat rules\"! He's right because the flavor was wonderful although I did drain the fat once the onions were cooked thru; which however should really be cooked until a deep golden brown in order to bring out the sweetness of the onion. I also added a bay leaf thyme garlic powder black pepper a can of beef consomme and used red wine instead of white. Very very good Julia and we thank you for sharing this great soup recipe!",

I would recommend using half the amount of onions called for. After cutting the recipe in half and only using one small sweet onion and one large white onion I still had enough soup for 4 people (as an appetizer). 2. I added only a pinch of salt broth is salty enough. 3. I cooked only 3 slices of bacon and that was plenty of grease! 4. I added the recommended allotment of wine and thought it was too much. 5. Use real sherry not cooking sherry. With those changes I think this would be a five star recipe. The bacon adds a unique flavor.",

He picked the recipe out - which wouldn't have been my first choice based on only 2 reviews but I think he picked it for the bacon. It was WONDERFUL and full of onions. We made it exactly like posted and actually called our neighbour over to enjoy a bowl with us. BRAVO! I've made it again but used more broth and I kinda blew it - too watery but still good. Next time I stick with 8 cups of broth. Yummy!!!",
