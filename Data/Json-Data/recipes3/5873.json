Not, something I'd do on a regular basis because I'm not looking to have a \"heart attack\" or cause my husband to have one either. And while I was on a bacon grease kick I decided to go ahead and pair this with \"Dad's Kentucky Home Fries\" from this site. I think the only healthy on our plates was the whole grain toast!",

In fact, my parents always kept a container of leftover grease in the fridge (cool the grease a little in the pan and pour it into a lidded heat-resistant container) and my siblings and I keep containers of it in our fridges. Bacon grease adds awesome flavour to so many fried things, from mushrooms to pancakes. :) Yeah, it's not so great for you, but sometimes you just gotta go for taste! Thanks for the post, Kirbert70!",
