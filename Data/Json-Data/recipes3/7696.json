This proves not to underestimate the potential of simple and humble dishes. In this case, since hubs detests feta, I took the submitter's suggestion to use smoked gouda and I'm telling you, these little tomato gems were outstandingly delicious. I mixed these together exactly as directed, using fresh tomatoes and herbs from my garden (that could be part of the reason these were so good) and let them set a bit before roasting while I prepared the rest of dinner. Everything was perfect, from the amounts of ingredients to the cooking time. These were a bigger hit than the main course! With more tomatoes on the vine, and gouda in the fridge these will be making an encore appearance real soon!",

All just small tweaks and I cooked the tomatoes for about 11 mins instead of 15 since my oven runs a little hot. Very yummy recipe I highly recommend it!
