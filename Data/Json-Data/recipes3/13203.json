I made this once with less lime juice and it was delicious. I suggest that lime juice is added to taste rather than using a whole lime as limes vary so much in acidity and size. Purple sweet potatoes are a nutrition powerhouse with the rare purple pigment needed for health. I made this recipe again but boiled the potatoes rather than baked and it turned out fine.",
