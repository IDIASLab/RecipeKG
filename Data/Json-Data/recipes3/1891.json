I also mix the sauce with the chicken rather than spreading it on top of the chicken to keep the chicken nice and moist. I also add leftover veggies (ie: peas broccoli carrots etc) to the chicken mixture more often than not. Its a good way to sneak in veggies since my hubby doesn't like to eat them plain!",
