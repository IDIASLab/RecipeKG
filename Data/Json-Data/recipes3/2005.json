This dough was so marvelous to work with. It rolled out smoothly and easily and the cookies did not spread out overly much on the cookie sheet. Then the taste test. This is probably the most delicious cookie I ve ever eaten! They are my new standard of excellence. The cookies are tender but not fragile and I am going to try shipping them and see how they do. I did use a half tsp of almond extract in addition to the vanilla just because I like that flavor. And I was out of cream of tartar so I checked online for a substitution and used a half teaspoon of baking powder in addition to the soda. Also as others mentioned watch them closely toward the end of baking as they can quickly become too browned on top. Thanks so much Sally for sharing this terrific recipe with us!",
