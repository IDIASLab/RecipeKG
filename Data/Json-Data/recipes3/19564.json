I love the flavor and nutrient value of swapping out the white potatoes for all sweet potatoes or a mix of sweet potatoes and turnips (equals more nutrients and lower glycemic effect than white potatoes). As another reviewer suggested I also like to add a thickner for that real stew quality. (Personally I always prefer using white or even better whole wheat pastry flour for my thickner to lower the glycemic effect - something even us non-diabetics benefit from health wise. Of course whenever one uses wheat flour compared to cornstarch you must take some liquid out add it to the flour and then add the mixture to the stew.)",
