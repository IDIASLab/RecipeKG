The flavor is wonderful in this dish. You can always put the skins off when you combine the rice/meats. Add a shake of turmeric (or colorante) to give the rice an even more brilliant color and don't be shy with the saffron. As much as you probably spent on the spice, put enough in to taste it. I put in a giant pinch and grind the threads with a few grains of salt or sugar before adding in.",

I much prefer the Paella I recipe\r\non this site.  Not only does it taste better, but it's actually easier to\r\ncook (requiring no marinating time and only one pan on which to focus).\r\nIt's also easier to drop ingredients from a good recipe than figure out what to add to a okay recipe like this.",

My changes: instead of using shellfish (due to allergy) I fried fish separately then cut it into strips and added it to the meat. Also I didn't use red pepper flakes and I'm glad I didn't because either the smoked paprika or the chorizo gave the meat mix lots of spice. I also cheated with the lemon zest. Since its not my favorite thing to do I used McCormick's \"California Lemon Peel\". Also a lot of reviewers have complained about the cost of saffron (which is 10-13/gram) but I've found that Mexican Saffron-- aka \"safflower\" is a highly acceptable substitute. It makes a VERY good saffron rice it's only 1 for a quarter ounce and you don't have to feel guilty about adding lots. I've made it with both the Spanish/Moroccan saffron as well as Mexican saffron and prefer the Mexican because it is quite good easy to find and doesn't break the bank.-- Basically the difference in taste doesn't justify the money and time spent to acquire Spanish saffron. Those were my main changes everything else has always been little; the recipe is forgiving enough to come out great almost no matter what.",

I recommend cooking the chorizo separately and draining it before adding it to the mix. I also cooked the shrimp separately and added it at the end, since I think some of the shrimp tends to get overcooked if you have it in a large pot with many other items. I made this for my husband's birthday dinner, with a few tapas as appetizers, and it was wonderful!!!",

Rice will come out perfectly moist with a bit of liquid remaining on bottom.
