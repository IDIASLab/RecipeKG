My husband said they reminded him of mushy peas which he loves but we both think they would be better with sauteed onions and garlic added to the mixture. And I think I could cut back on the flour next time a bit. Still it's a great idea and I'll make again with some additions to suit our tastes. Don't skip the freshly grated parmesan...in fact I would add even more next time.",

I will also suggest that you make the patties as small as possible this makes the frying much easier and the taste a whole lot better. Lastly I deep-fried them in canola oil. They were divine!!!!
