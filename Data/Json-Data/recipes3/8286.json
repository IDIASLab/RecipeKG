First I used turkey sausage (trying not to give hubs a heart attack) :) I didn't drain the bacon grease but did drain after I cooked up the onion mix. I used 12 eggs and added milk, added 1 16oz bag of shredded hash browns to the eggs after I beat them. After meat and veggies were cool and drained I put that in the bottom of my dish and poured the egg/potato mixture over that and stirred together. I don't have time in the morning to bake this so I am letting it sit for a few hours, bake tonight and serve re heated tomorrow. My husband will re heat and eat it all week for breakfast. Me on the other hand is not a fan of reheating eggs. Thanks for the recipe!",

This one was great!\r\n\r\nSince I did not make this as an Easter dish, I stirred half the shredded cheese into the egg/potato mixture and sprinkled half on top. I diced the black olives and also stirred them into the mixture. \r\n\r\nThis recipe would also be great with just one of the meats - I may try sausage only next time. And the amount of meat in the recipe as published is generous. The finished product would still be great with one pound of either bacon or sausage.",

I was intrigued by the ingredient list and the fact this recipe was \"faceless\" and decided to give this a whirl. I had some mild sausage I needed to use so I decased it and used it in lieu of the bulk pork and I subbed ham for bacon. I knew I wasn't going the cross route so I mixed 1/2 the cheese in w/the casserole and topped it w/the other 1/2 per directions. This was tasty but none of us tasted the chiles or the liquid smoke or red pepper sauce. While we enjoyed it it won't replace \"Amish Breakfast Casserole\" as my go to. THANKS for the recipe LisaD!",
