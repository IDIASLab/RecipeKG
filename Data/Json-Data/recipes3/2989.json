We have made this since I was a little kid with this recipe: 16 slices bread 3 tablespoons unsalted butter softened 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1/2 cup porter or ale 1/4 cup whole milk 1 teaspoon dry mustard 1/8 teaspoon black pepper 6 oz extra-sharp Cheddar coarsely grated (about 1 1/2 cups). We as kids tore up the toast because it was fun the adults cut it up with a fork and knife. It's also called Buck Rabbit (or rarebit) if you put a fried egg on the toast. This is the closest I could find to the old recipe I used from the old Betty Crocker recipe. The Welsh Rarebit recipes are off too because you shouldn't use processed cheese or tomato soup!",
