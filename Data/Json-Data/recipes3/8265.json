I followed others advice and reduced the salt and omitted the pepper and replaced them with a teaspoon of Old Bay.  I also used only two eggs - which was plenty.  AND I dipped the shrimp into the egg twice -- once before dredging in flour and then again after dredging in flour (before coating with panko).  I also found that one cup of panko was plenty.  Another tip -- put them in the freezer for about 10 - 15 minutes after coating and before frying\u2026 I do this with everything we fry (makes the batter adhere better).   I fried them in 2\" of oil in our deep fryer.",

I used about 1 tsp Old Bay Seasoning in 1/2 c. flour and about the same amount in 1 c. panko crumbs. Used only 2 beaten eggs.  Just the right amt of ingred for a 14oz pkg frozen jumbo shrimp.  Deep fried in batches of 6 for about 3 min @ 350 degrees.  Dipped in Cross & Blackwell seafood sauce......yummmmm.  The 2 of us ate everyone of them!! Good recipe.",

I also didn't have the freshest of cooking oils for deep frying usage and so on.  The end result was tasty but seemed alil more on the 'eggy-heavier' side instead of on the 'light-crunchy' side that I was aiming for.  A recipe I am willing to try again with the proper preparation needed but one I would prefer not to go through the hassle of doing if repeated with what I was working with.",
