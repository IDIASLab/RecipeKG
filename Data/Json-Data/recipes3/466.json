Stir in 1/8 cup water and 1/2 cup sugar. Boil for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, stir in 1/4 cup Southern Comfort.  After removing the cake from the pan, prick top of cake. Brush half of glaze evenly over top and sides. Cool cake. Reheat glaze and brush over cake. Before serving, sift 1 tbsp powdered sugar over cake. Delicious!",

I used a chocolate cake mix (w/o pudding) a pkg of chocolate instant pudding and replaced the Southern Comfort with 1/4c dark rum and 1/4c coconut rum. In place of the walnuts I used about 1/2c of coconut and 1/3c pecans (I didn't measure these). I baked 8 mini-loaf pans 12 mini-muffins and a small ramekin adjusting the baking time accordingly. They are SUPER - the only thing I'd probably do differently is either stick with all coconut rum or add a little coconut extract. I imagine it would be equally good using just plain rum if you don't care for coconut. This seems to be a very versatile recipe and will be a keeper for me because of the ease in substituting ingredients. I'm also considering a lemon cake/pudding with lemon bacardi rum this summer to serve with strawberries.",
