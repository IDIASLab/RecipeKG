A difficulty I had with the recipe, and many others that ask for a number of apples, potatoes, onions etc, is that I don't know what that really means.

I scaled this down using the \"change servings\" feature on this site. Followed the recipe to the letter except for using half-and-half instead of whipping cream. There was not enough liquid to even finish cooking the potatoes in the oven. I ended up adding more half-and-half more milk and even more cinnamon and nutmeg but it still didn't have a lot of flavor. Sorry for the bad review Jill H but this just didn't measure up to an au gratin dish in my opinion. Not sure what went wrong but I won't be making this again.",
