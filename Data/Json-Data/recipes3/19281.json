My only changes were to par-cook the chicken with some spices, could only find a 12-oz can of milk so I put the whole thing in, and stirred the stuffing into the wet mix before spooning it over the chicken.  My husband loved it (said, \"Three thumbs up\") but he'll eat anything that doesn't get up and walk away.  My super-finicky 6-yr-old: TWO servings!  That NEVER happens.  Yep, this is a keeper!  The only thing I'd do differently next time is to make one of the cans of soup a low-sodium type.  We like salty stuff, but this was a bit much, even for us.  Otherwise, a perfect dish!!

Sometimes I make my own stuffing from left-over home-made whole wheat bread cubes, tossed with melted butter and poultry seasoning, (which I make myself from a recipe on this site), and sometimes I just use the \"off the shelf\" stuffing mix.  I usually add some fresh vegetable or other, (last night it was broccoli), and add it to the water and butter that's melting in the pan to be added to the stuffing mix, just to give the recipe a nutritional, color, and texture boost.  If I think it needs more moisture, I make my own home-made \"cream soup\" and pour it over the top and shake it through.  If I have any grated cheese handy, (just about any kind works!), I sprinkle that on the top, too, before baking.  This has become one of my kids' and husband's favorite recipes.  Left-overs are great!",

I adapted this recipe slightly by 1) using a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken (and once, a pre-cooked rotisserie turkey breast)and using canned broth in place of the boiled chicken water. I simply pulled apart the chicken and kept some aside for sandwiches and such, and chopped the rest of up for layering into the casserole; 2) in addition to the crunch of celery and veggies, I scattered craisens (dried cranberries) onto the stuffing mixture. They absorbed the liquid of the casserole and became soft and tender, but held their intregrity, for a bit of sharp cranberry contrast which for me, completes the \"Thanksgiving in a hot dish\" flavor combo. 3) Evap Milk was not required. I've used milk and also FF half and half. The finished texture of this casserole is not \"stiff.\" It's rather soupy, like a very thick Chicken Pot pie mixture, so don't expect anything you can \"slice.\"",
