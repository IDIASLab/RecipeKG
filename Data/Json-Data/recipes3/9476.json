Next time I might add a clove of minced garlic, but otherwise this was a nice twist on the usual broiled veggie recipe. I used a mandolin, which really sped up the chopping process and I cut the yams slightly thinner than the other veggies. It's a bright, pretty dish (see photos) and all around fairly easy to prep, not to mention super healthy. I think it would be fine to sub olive oil for the butter, though it does add a bit of flavor. BTW this makes your house smell so good!  I will make this again. Thanks Pegzhere!",
