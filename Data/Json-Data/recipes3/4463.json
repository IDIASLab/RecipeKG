I think I prefer it with my usual chicken/onion/green bell pepper combo but it was still good. The only things I did differently were to use powdered ginger instead of fresh and I cooked it all in a skillet on the stove top. I also sprinkled some sliced green onions on top which made it look pretty. If I were to make it again I'd sprinkle on some toasted sesame seeds as well. Nice recipe. Thanks!",
