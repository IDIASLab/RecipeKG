I had to modify the ingredients a little in quantity as my pie plate is of a larger size about 10 inches. But otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Since my pie was bigger and perhaps my oven a little cooler I needed to cook it about 55 minutes and could probably have gone to 60 minutes. The broccoli was crisp and had a little crunch which was perfect. We are looking forward to the leftovers and we will make this again!",
