I added 8-12 ounces cheddar (we like it cheesy) and 2-3 ounces cream cheese to the mashed potatoes.  This ended up being the perfect amount for 36 three inch round pierogies.",

Add 1 cup of sourcream, 4 cups of finely chopped cooked onion and  2 cups of finely chopped cooked bacon.  Place inside perogi/pierogi dough, boil and freeze.  Secret tip: add a small amount of the potato mixture to the dough to help them hold together while cooking.",
