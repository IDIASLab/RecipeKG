You can use low fat cheese & dressing to cut down on the calories if you want as well. I'd suggest layering 1/2 the cheese over 1/2 the veggies & spreading the other half of the veggies on top of the 2nd layer of egg mixture before topping the dish with 1/2 of the remaining cheese (layering like a lasagna). I imagine that you could break the bread into smaller pieces & mix everything together as well saving some cheese for the topping. This was OK but I guess I like a quiche better than a strata as this just seemed to have ALOT of bread.",
