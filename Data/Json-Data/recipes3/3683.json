Well all I can say is that it was WAY better than I thought it would be. I made this recipe for 2 but I used the whole can of tomato soup plus a good glug of V8 veggie juice or it would have been way too dry. I also used much more cheese. This was very good - a kind of 'poor man's lasagna.' I will make this again for sure. Thank you very much!",
