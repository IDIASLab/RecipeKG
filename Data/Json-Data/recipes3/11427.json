For the 1st time making it I used 2 cans of drained Rotel tomatoes as datharp1 suggested also adding part of the drained juice. I like my breakfast casseroles with potatoes so subbed 2 thin layers of frozen cubed potatoes for the tortillas. It turned out pretty good slightly spicy. Will make it again.
