However, the proportion of milk to biscuit mix is too high; use less milk, maybe 1/2 cup.  Also, I added chopped onions, green peppers, zucchini and mushrooms to the ground beef as it cooked.  It was a great way to sneak some veggies into my kids and added more flavor to the pie.  This will be a keeper.  Thanks, Rhonda!",
