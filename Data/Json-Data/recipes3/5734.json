I didn't pound the chicken as I didn't mind cooking it a little longer. I coated the chicken in mesquite seasoning and let it sit for a few hours and didn't add any more mesquite seasoning later. Then I coated the bottom of the dutch oven with plenty of vegetable oil and 1 tbs butter heated it to sizzling and cooked the chicken browning on each side and basting with pan juices until done about 20 minutes. Then I melted cheddar cheese on top. Then I took the chicken out added the mushrooms oregano and salt and when the mushrooms were tender I added a cup of my homemade potato soup. This eliminated having to remove the mushrooms. My soup has carrots and celery in it and my husband said that really added to the flavor. I don't eat chicken so I have to go on his recommendations and he gave it 5 stars.",
