So here's what I did (for those that need that extra punch in a soup). I used a whole chicken put it in a large pot added just enough water to cover the chicken (a bit of the chicken was still above the water. This makes a stronger tasting broth). I added 3 carrots 3 stalks of celery a whole onion a few garlic cloves a parsnip salt AND 4 packets of chicken bouillion. I simmered on low about 1 1/2 hours. Strained the broth chopped up the chicken saved the cooked veggies to eat later and followed the recipe for the rest. It's such a refeshingly clear tasting soup. Never be afraid to alter a recipe. What's posted is one person's taste buds speaking and we're all different. Taste as you go... that's my rule. Enjoy. I'd suggest you cut back on the lemon to half then taste and add more if you need it.",

It only cost me 10.00 to make this and that included bread for dipping in the soup plus it made a lot so I have some in my freezer. Next time I'll add more rice and more lemon.

(no, the egg makes it creamy) The only way I could enjoy the meal was to take a bite of something else to break it up a little.  There's something about how the egg and the strong lemon taste overwhelm your mouth that made me feel like I was eating something from another culture, that I would have had to grow up with to love. (like hagus, or eskimo ice cream)  If you have a raw chicken staring at you asking \"So whaddaya wanna do?\"....find another recipe.  If you like greek lemon soup...it had plenty of flavor.",
