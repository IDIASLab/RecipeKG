I cooked it on low for 9 hours.  The flavor was excellent, especially for such a simple recipe.  I was very pleased with the results and will definitely make again.  This would be an easy recipe to tweak to your personal taste.  This made 4 VERY generous servings -- probably more like 5.\n\n*****ETA: Several years later, I'm still making this chili, but I've made a couple additional changes (beside omitting the tomato juice) to make it even thicker.  Now I use an extra  1/2 lb of ground beef and instead of using 15 oz of tomato sauce, I use 8 oz of tomato sauce and 6 oz of tomato paste.  This chili is good the first night, but the leftovers are GREAT.",

Layer kidney beans ground beef chili seasoning and MANWICH sauce in crockpot. Give it a stir to blend all ingredients and set on LOW for about 5 hrs.

Not drained. You can throw diced peppers in it to with your onion and celery. I do if I have them. Then whole tomatoes diced tomatoes tomatoe soup tomatoe juice. Whatever you have tomatoey. If you like it hot put some hot pepper flakes in it. I serve those on the side husband likes it hot children do not.Also my husband likes elbow macaroni in his chili. It doesn't bother me so I do it. Make it in a Dutch oven. If it dosen't look like enough and some water with some more spices you like. You can also scale it down for a smaller version.",
