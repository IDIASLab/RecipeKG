Added chicken stock (I was only making two so I used half). Then when I was sure the cutlets were done I removed them to the plate to keep warm. Added the wine and I REALLY reduced the broth wine mixture to well below 1/2, to a thick sauce. There isn't a lot, but the flavor is concentrated. I drizzled that over the cutlets and sprinkled the parsley and greens from scallions over the pork and the plain rice. Really nice. Very easy and pretty quick. ",
