I like the coarse texture of the \"mashed\" avocado so I use a large fork rather than a small one.  If I'm making a large amount for a party I strain the juice from a couple of fresh lemons, put it in a spray bottle and lightly spray the interior of my bowl and the top surface of the piled on Guacamole. I have found that if you get too much lemon IN the Guacamole it changes the whole flavor, makes it taste lile \"store bought\".",
