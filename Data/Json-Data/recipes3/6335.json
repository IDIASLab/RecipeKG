And just as I do with \u201ctraditional\u201d Rouladen, I prepared it all on the stovetop, simmering the beef rolls for about an hour and a half and then making the gravy.  Hubs really liked this, calling it \u201cvery pleasant.\u201d   I thought it was good, not great.  And while he liked the Dijon in the gravy, I was less enthusiastic and could have easily left it out.  The red wine, on the other hand, and the thyme, should not be skipped, as they contribute the complexity of flavor this might lack otherwise.",
