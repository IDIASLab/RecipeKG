Boil them until just tender rinse in cool water to get the excess starch off and to stop the cooking. Add them to the soup broth last and bring the broth back to temp and serve. I also put in a few dashes of Maggi seasoning or a TBs of powdered AuJus mix to give the chicken stock some added flavor dimension. The shrimp broth is a nice flavor rounder also.",
