I wasn't sure how much to add so at first I minced about 7-8 mint leaves. It gave just a slight hint of flavor (barely noticeable), so I added another 7-8 leaves and it was perfect!   I highly recommend this addition. It gives the salad such a fresh flavor.  I have a hard time getting hubby to eat any sort of salad, and  with his first bite he said WOW, this is really good!  The only change I made was to use way less red onion than called for. I ended up using about 1/4 onion, since most red onions are huge. Thanks for the recipe NOOSH!",

I used dry green lentil cooked to package specifications and I think I made too much but adjusted the ingredients to compensate. I added much more seasoning than listed (that is tarragon mint and other Mediterranean spices) and also added seasoned rice wine vinegar in addition to the apple cider vinegar. I would make this salad frequently! Even my husband who likes lentils less than I liked this salad. I believe this recipe could be tweaked to any taste. I highly recommend trying this recipe even if you don't think you like lentils. Like me you might be surprised.:)",
