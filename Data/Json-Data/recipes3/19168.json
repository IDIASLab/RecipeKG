I did not have vanilla pudding but  I had Lemon pudding and used that.  For adding the beer I used a cup like it said but used the regular directions off the cake mix box.  Mixed it all up and baked it like the recipe said to. Then after it was baked I left it in the Tube pan while I made a glaze for it.  What I did was use the rest of the beer about 4oz then added about 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of butter and a 1 1/3 cup of sugar put it all in a sauce pan and brought it to a boil to make it like a syrup.  I poured some over the top of the cake let it soak in then I took cake flipped it on to a plate and drizzled more on the top.  Let me tell you that was the most moist cake I had ever had.  I had so many comments on it everyone thought it was AWESOME!!!!",

It was a very big hit among all the adults and several of the kids enjoyed it too. I made the cake using Pillsbury yellow cake mix and French Vanilla instant pudding mix and a bottle of Budwiser Beer. I also used exra large eggs. The batter was extremely easy and you need to beat it on high for a couple of minutes. It will become thick and smooth. The cake is very light and fluffy probably due to the beer. I sprinkled the cake with powdered sugar and it gave it just the right amount of sweetness - is was just perfect. A great way to make a boxed cake just a notch better.",

For a friend who doesn't approve of alcohol I made this recipe using diet vanilla cream soda. It turned out great and prevented the usual slight banana flavor I get when using a light beer. The cream soda is especially good with white cake mix and white chocolate pudding. The best thing about this recipe is how versatile it is. Thanks for a great recipe!",
