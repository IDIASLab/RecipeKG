Use baby potatoes if you prefer, use a yellow or white onion if you don't have red, substitute a different fully cooked, smoked sausage. Add a fresh garden salad or a side of green beans for a complete meal. While I have not yet tried it, I think carrots, cut in 1-inch pieces, would go well as an addition to this recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "8.11.19 One thing needs to change on this recipe. It either has to bake for less time or the temperature needs to be reduced. The chicken thighs TOTALLY overcooked as well as the onions. At 450\u00baF the onions don t need to be added until later probably when you add the sausage. otherwise they burn up. Next time I will start checking the temperature of the chicken at 10-15 minutes instead of 25. I agree with the recipe author s suggestion that carrots would be a good addition and I would include them right when the chicken and potatoes go into the oven. The orange zest and the orange juice are a nice addition at the end really brighten the flavor. Don t mean to sound negative because I think this has the potential to be a 5-star recipe just needs a few adjustments. The flavor was still very good and the cleanup was a breeze. Thanks for sharing.",
