Try to stick with penne or rotini. Do not overcook the pasta! Second while the pasta is cooking prepare 2 cans (6 oz each) of drained albacore tuna (flaked) in a large bowl. Use the tuna can to measure the olive oil. I usually fill it up half way. Add olive oil to tuna then salt and pepper to taste. Mince 4 cloves of garlic in bowl and stir. When the pasta is done drain and run under cold water. Then add pasta to tuna mixture. Add more salt and pepper. And 2 more cloves of garlic. You can eat this cold or nuke it in the microwave for 2 minutes.",
