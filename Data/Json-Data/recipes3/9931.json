Maybe not as fluffy as with all the fat but tasty none the less. We made half plain and added a teaspoon of dry rosemary to the other half. Both were great but the rosemary ones were fabulous.

As FYI I used Wegman's unbleached white whole wheat flour. Bag says 100% whole wheat but certainly baked up like white flour.",
