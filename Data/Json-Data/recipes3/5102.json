How could something this simple be that good? Well when it was done I didn't have to wonder anymore. This IS delicious! It's warm and cool creamy and crispy all at the same time. While I added a dash of garlic powder and a couple of shakes of dried chives to the sauce using less yogurt and mayo than it called for this recipe would be good (if overly saucy) as is. My only suggestion: eat it right away or let the sauce come to room temperature before mixing in with the potatoes. Otherwise the potatoes cool to lukewarm and lose their delicious oven crispiness. It's simple and tasty - try it today!",

I used Yukon Gold potatoes and the only thing I did different was I added a little dehidrated onions with the olive oil and a few dashes of paprika to the sauce. I served it with meatloaf and it complimented it very nicely. Next time I make it I will not make as much of the sauce, had quite a bit of it left over so think I only need to make 2/3rds of that. ",
