As one other reviewer noted it did not have any mention of broth so I made the recipe as written with a couple of exceptions. I only browned the pork with the onions as the simmering would finish it off. Once the cabbage was wilted I added the spices as directed and then added enough chicken broth to cover an make it appear more soup like. I then adjusted the seasonings to compensate for the addition of the broth (basically a bit more ketchup - more salt pepper celery salt (ddin't have celery seed) and allspice to taste) Then let simmer for 30 to 45 min. Pork came out very tender and the flavors were very appealing. Thanks for the recipe - will make again!",
