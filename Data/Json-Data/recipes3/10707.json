If a neutral oil is desired, why not use healthful oil like avocado or grape seed, instead of the extremely hydrogenated trans fat of Canola, which, evidently, must be heated to this extreme because of hexane (poison) used to extract oil from the rapeseed used in Canadian (Canola) oil. This high heat is required to pass FDA to low \"enough\" standards.\n\nI, for one, see no reason to risk my brain, liver and kidneys on the hope that they have elininated \"enough\" of the hexane.",
