Per previous suggestions, I made a graham cracker crust and used a springform pan - both gave it a beautiful presentation.  People thought a chocolate graham crust might be too chocolatey and that regular graham gave it good flavor.  I also chopped the cookies in a blender which was a snap.  I made one with Oreos and one with Chips Ahoy - the Chips Ahoy was more popular.",
