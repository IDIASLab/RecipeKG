It is similar to one I found on a vegetarian website, however, I made my own additions and now it is amazing! These are an awesome side dish or main dish! They can be served with Parmesan cheese, red or green hot sauce, or olive tapenade, but these are also great by themselves!",

I also felt that the Kalamata olives overpowered the artichokes and I would have preferred the other way around! If you can master the proper cooking time and balance the flavor to your personal taste I can see that these would be a nifty sandwich filler or take the place of a starch on the plate.",
