I split the sauce in half -- the first half I kept as a finely diced salsa the second half I pureed in a blender to make more of a sauce. I presented the scallops by first making a small pool of sauce layering the scallops on top and then finally garnishing the scallops with the salsa. It looked nice and added some nice flavor to the scallops (which I choose not to coat with flour before frying).",

Also as others suggested I made half of the papaya mix into a salsa and I pureed the other half into a sauce. This recipe makes LOADS of the papaya sauce so even if you halve it you will have plenty to work with. We really enjoyed this with Goldy's Special Salad (found on allrecipes.com).",

To spice it up I changed the pepper to habanero used regular sweet yellow onions (Walla Walla). I made some rice cooked in coconut milk.. and voila!! It even looked pretty on the plate! Great choice!",

I would probably try with smaller (cheaper) bay scallops next time and reserve half the papaya in the fridge to eat later.",

It was an easy recipe but really didn't have a lot of flavor.

I also think mango would be a better choice than the papaya.",

The \"salsa\" was excellent but the sea scallops were a little bland and got cold too fast on top of the cold salsa mixture. The two just didn't go together that well and reminded me of some dishes I get in trendier restaurants that just don't turn out to be that good because someone was trying to be a little too creative. I don't think I would ever flour scallops again. I'd rather just pan fry them in some flavored oil. Part of the problem may have been that I did use the large sea scallops (which I was told have better flavor) rather than the small bay scallops. In my opinion scallops just don't have much flavor in any form. I prefer Chinese scallop dishes a lot more.",
