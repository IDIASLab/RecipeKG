Take the time to thinly slice the garlic instead of dice it as it makes a difference (especially if you soak up the sauce with a nice crusty bread, which you definitely should!).  Next time, I will make sure I have a better paprika - the regular stuff is fine, but a smoky hot paprika would have been better. I tried to make up the difference with a bit of chipotle tabasco, which was not out of place but could've been better. This is a very simple recipe which I'll definitely make again.",
