We made it using her recipe directions which was to rub each scallop with the olive mixture rather than toss. I don't eat scallops but my fiance said they were OK. The olive mixture he said lended an odd but not bad flavor. Very pretty presentation though and easy to make up ahead and bake when desired.",
