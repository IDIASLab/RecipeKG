I only used 4 white onions used regular pie crusts (not deep dish) and had enough batter for almost 2 tarts. I would suggest trying 1 deep dish pie crust and hopefully everything will fit in it. Also I made one batch with the bacon one without. It turned out much better without the bacon. Based on my research bacon is not used in many other traditional onion tart recipes. Lastly I did not have nutmeg so I used McCormick's Allspice. This addition really made the difference and would suggest using it.",
