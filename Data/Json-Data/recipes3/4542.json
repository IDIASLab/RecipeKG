Mine came out with a lovely cheesy crust on top and a beautiful crunchy bottom layer as well. My hub thought it was a bit bland (which is weird because usually I'm the one who finds things bland but not this time) but my 2 toddlers gobbled it up. I didn't know exactly what to do with the eggs (I beat them before adding them) and the recipe didn't say what to do with the basil and mint (I added them with the cheese and eggs etc) but it seemed to work out just fine. I made it with ground chicken and would probably double the meat next time. I also made it with a can of diced tomatoes and I might like even more tomatoes next time. I appreciated not having to chop anything and I will definitely make this again!",

My husband who usually eats anything took two bites and couldn't eat anymore. I tried it the next day as left overs...and it wasn't any better. Because I hate wasting food I drowned it in cheese and ranch dressing so it was edible.

I also added about a teaspoon of marjoram and a teaspoon of crushed italian seasoning to the ground beef while it cooked and I think that it could have used even a bit more of the marjoram. I didn't have chicken broth so used beef and I think that it worked out just fine.
