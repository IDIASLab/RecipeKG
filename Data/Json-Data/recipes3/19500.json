I didn't use sweetener nor did I use whole cup of corn syrup but chose real sugar and this may have been the reason. It was juicy on the bottom but dry on top. I will tent with some foil next time to keep the juices in there. Regardless this was a simple light and enjoyable apple pie that I will make again. Thank you Cathy for your recipe.",
