Love it because when you\u2019re about over all the ham, prepping it this way is truly something different. I\u2019ve got little kiddos and they all devour this (11 months, 2.5 and 4). This is a forgiving recipe. I adjust it based on what I have and always omit the olives (not a fan). Any type of almond will work (currently used slivered because that\u2019s what\u2019s left post Christmas.) Definitely a keeper. This is the 7th or 8th time I\u2019ve made this since stumbling across the recipe.",
