The almond and vanilla flavors were a nice combination. The recipe was super easy and the time for prep/baking was correct for me. My housemate said he thought they were like Christmas cookies without the cinnamon (which for him is good because he doesn't like cinnamon) so maybe a nice variant could involve some cinnamon.",
