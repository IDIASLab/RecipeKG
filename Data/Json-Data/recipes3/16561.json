Decrease the butter amount because the bacon was not drained (used leaner bacon). Made the cream sauce with some added parmesean cheese about a tbsp or 2. Less milk and added weight watchers cream cheese. Fresh spinach. Poured creamed sauce over fresh spinach and served. AWESOME!",

It wasn't till after I started that I realized the recipe called for two packages of spinach and I only had one. I used all ingredients as called for except the one package and I cut back on the milk by 1/4 cup. I added a little nutmeg too. Although the bacon was good....it's not my favorite flavor to go with the creamed spinach. I might try some parmesan next time too. Thanks!",
