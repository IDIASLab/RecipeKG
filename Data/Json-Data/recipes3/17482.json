I should give them a 3 though because I added taco seasoning as others mentioned and I think it would have been quite boring without it. Just a word of advice...I flattened all of my circles then topped with a little cheese the meat (ground turkey) and more cheese. When I went back to fold them over the circles has shrunk up and it was a bit difficult to seal them. Might want to fill and seal them one at a time to prevent that. Also all of the meat didn't fit into the 'empanadas' so I had quite a bit left over. Served with salsa sour cream and a salad.",
