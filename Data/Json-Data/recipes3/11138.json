Tossed the old fashioned oats in my Vitamix to make the flour and then added everything else as directed. I didn't have agave syrup so I used raw unfiltered honey. The batter was a little thick even for my Vitamix but it did the job just fine. A less powerful blender \"might\" have an issue with the thick batter. I filled the muffin liners about 3/4 full. I used the tiny muffin liners and it made 24 tiny muffins and I had enough batter left for 6 regular sized muffins. The tiny muffins were done in 10 minutes while it took 13 minutes to bake the regular size muffins. Not too much banana or nut flavor and they were not overly sweet. Just right! These little gems bake up so moist and delicious and the flavors mingle well.",

I used honey instead of agave as well. Turned out fantastic. Next time might add walnuts:-) ( I mixed all dry ingredients together by hand and then the wet then hand stirred both together)",

I wish the amount of bananas was in cups instead of three bananas. My three were about 1 cup. Also I may add more agave or just plain sugar next time to increase the flavor.",
