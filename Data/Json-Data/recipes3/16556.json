To cut down on fat as many people mentioned use skim milk and instead of fat free cream cheese (which I've found really does significantly affect the taste negatively) I use neufchatel cheese which has about a third less fat but retains the flavor. Also I've never made it with cherry tomatoes either just chop up some plum tomatoes or try using a package of sundried tomatoes instead for a little more interesting flavor. Baby portabellos can be substituted for white mushrooms etc. This recipe is one of my favorites and has room for lots of possibilities.",

I also cut the amount of cream cheese & spinach in half (4 oz. cream cheese and 5 oz. of spinach). I sauteed 3 minced garlic cloves with the onion and added some fresh chopped basil 1/2 tsp of italion seasoning and a few dashes of salt. I didn't have any mushrooms or I would have added them and we're not big tomato eaters here so I omitted those as well. Even with reducing the cream cheese this recipe was still very rich. The next time I make it I will use skim milk instead of 2% and I will add a little bit more of it. I may even cut back on the cream cheese a bit more. But I will definitely make it again!

I used 3/4 cup of milk and half a packet of Italian dressing seasoning for the blandness others were talking about. To cut back on fat I used neufatchel cheese and sauteed the onions with garlic. With all the liquid from the tomatoes and spinach plus the extra milk I found myself with too much sauce. It was the right consistency but I probably should've used more than 9 oz of tortellini. Great way to prepare some extra spinach I had on hand.",

I used spinach stuffed tortellini as it was all I had on hand and for the sauce I used 95% fat-free cream cheese 1% milk and I am sure that lowered the calories a ton! Along with using a wee bit of Olive Oil for sauteeing the mushrooms makes for a very waist-line friendly meal. You do not need all the calories of butter regular cream cheese and cream/whole milk. It has a raelly nice flavour and the spinach/tomatoes make a nice colourful presentation! Thanks Jennifer for creating this dish! YUM!",
