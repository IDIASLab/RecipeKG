They turn a lovely, bright, fresh green which provides eye appeal, then you get to the taste - buttery, slightly sweet, slightly earthy and all the way delicious. The 1/4 cup of butter made me nervous, but they are not greasy at all.  I didn't have honey butter so I simply drizzled about a large tsp of honey over them when they were almost done and mixed it in as I transferred to a serving bowl. The wine just pulls it all together.  I may add a bit of minced garlic to the onions next time.  And there will be many next times. Thank you, Pat.",

Just used butter and honey because I didn't have honey-flavored butter and sliced the sprouts because my processor was too small.
