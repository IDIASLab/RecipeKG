I made this strictly because I had bowls of tomatoes - mostly cherry and grape - that needed to be used NOW and they were just beyond the stage that I would eat them raw. So I roasted about 5 Roma and two medium beefsteak cut in wedges and maybe a pint and a half each of cherry and grape leaving them whole. Doubled the garlic and when it came time to add broth just used a cup or so of vegetable stock. I could not believe how delicious this soup is! And despite the fact that I added no cream or milk it actually looked creamy! I didn't mind the skins as others had mentioned as the food processor mulched them up pretty good but it does have lots of seeds that unless you're in the mood for a real rustic soup you may want to strain them out before adding the basil. Tough call though because if you strain the seeds you're straining the tomato pulp and pieces of garlic so I just chose to live with it. Delicious and healthy and now no garden tomatoes will ever go to waste in my house - Thank you!!!",
