I used Yukon Gold and sweet potatoes, and I followed the advice of other reviewers, decreasing balsamic vinegar to 1 1/2 Tbsp. and increasing chicken broth to 3/4 cup. I also used 1/2 tsp. of dried thyme because I didn't have fresh. I baked for one hour, stirring 2 or 3 times during baking to ensure that none of the pieces on top dried out. It turned out great. Even my five-year-old, who generally dislikes sweet potatoes, loved them in this dish. I can't wait to make it again.",
