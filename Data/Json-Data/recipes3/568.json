Milk burns easily, so I suggest using a can of water instead & adding another can of cr of mushroom (or other cream soup). Also, place the ingredients in a casserole dish and bake at 350 for 1 hr with the lid on, and 1/2 hr with the lid off. Make other variations to suit your tastes. Adding fresh dill, garlic, fresh mushrooms and/or cheese can make all the difference in the world.",
