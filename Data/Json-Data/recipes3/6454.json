The white gravy adds a sense of the holiday season with its wonderful aroma and flavor. Please be aware, measurements are estimates as I use the Italian-style 'to taste' method of cooking.

I was leery about green beans cooking so I used food processor to gently chop the green beans onion and cranberries which worked very quickly and easily. I think if you are a fan of turkey meatloaf you'd like this. I'm not sure I enjoyed the cinnamon and nutmeg flavor in the gravy; if it were a more traditional turkey gravy I believe the gravy would have appealed more to my personal tastes and helped to make the meatloaf taste more to my liking. It did look pretty and the pancetta crisped up beautifully on the top. Next time I'll layer more on the top than the nine slices I used since it shrinks. I followed the recipe exactly.
