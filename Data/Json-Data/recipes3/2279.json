Then stirred in all seasonings except for the salt. It cooked in about 30 minutes then I stirred in 6 chicken bouillon cubes and the salt. Only four stars because it needed something more as far as seasonings go. It has a chewy texture due to the rice and barley not a mushy one like I expected. I like it and will make it again. It's a great way to get fiber and protein and the grains and legumes make a complete protein!",

For us personally, next time I will doctor it up a bit, add more garlic, maybe some bouillon, etc.  For leftovers we added smoked sausage.  I picked it over the myriad of soup mixes because it could be given to my vegetarian friends, and because it was so simple.  Look for red lentils if you can find them.  It was pretty in the jar, and well received.  I put the spices in a snack-sized ziplock bag and stuffed it in the top of the jar.  It all fit very nicely.  I also used brown rice instead of white rice.  Just a personal preference.",

I omitted rice (since that's what made it so sticky) while keeping the same water amount doubled the garlic powder used cumin instead of sage and added 1/4 cup chicken stock powder (would have preferred beef but grocery was out). I also sauteed the onion in olive oil before adding lentils/barley/peas. So good. The changes are easy enough to put in instructions so I'll give out my tweaked version.",
