I made it precisely as directed and it went together quickly and without fuss. It wasn't as sweet as I was expecting it to be which is good but it also wasn't tart enough for me perhaps a shot of lemon juice would perk it up a bit. I didn't like how it looked with the cherries split up over the top and bottom either. It looked more inept than appetizing. I think it d be better to put the lemon mix then all the cherries then the cool whip. I'll also use real whipping cream next time to get rid of the chemical taste of the cool whip. Aside from all that it tasted great the second day and with the changes I mentioned above I will make it again. A different creamy dessert is always fun to try at a party!",
