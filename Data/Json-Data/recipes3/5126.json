I didn't use either green pepper or black eyed peas and substituted oil and vinegar salt and pepper for the Italian salad dressing (because I didn't have any of these and sweet vidalia onion instead of red onion and it was definitely a keeper! The chicken took longer than the recipe said but I had huge chicken breasts so of course it would take longer to grill. I also marinated it longer than the 10 minutes it stated about 4 hours it needed that to get the flavor imparted to the meat. Yum!",

You could double (or more) the lettuce...I chopped it up first so it was easier to eat. The marinade is enough for more chicken than listed. I sliced the chicken breasts in half to shorten the grilling time. Wish I'd marinated and cooked more for leftovers. Followed recipe for the most part (mixed spices with lime juice...didn't have tequila (or any other alcohol) but added a tequila lime dry marinade from Cabelas that I had in the cupboard to the lime juice and spices and only marinaded for about 20 minutes since the chicken was so thin) Also I didn't have Italian dressing so I just sprinkled in about 1 tsp. Italian seasoning and 1-2 TBSP each of vinegar and oil in the salsa (you could use more if you like Italian dressing). I made the salsa about 1/2 hour before dinner and it worked great. I don't know that waiting 6 hours is necessary. I did stir it every few minutes while it sat in the fridge. Will definitely make this again!",
