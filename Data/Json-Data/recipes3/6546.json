I added about 1/4 cup of chopped onions and browned them in the butter.  Then I added the mushrooms followed by the wine with 1 teaspoon of Maggi Sauce.  As directed I added the balsamic vinegar and reduced the liquid.  I added just a bit more wine with some salt and pepper to taste and then a little cornstarch with water to thicken the sauce.  My husband loved it and with less vinegar I think this will be a winner!",
