I used minced garlic from a jar instead of garlic powder and instead of Sam Adam's used Michelob Ultra.  I think any type of full bodied beer will work fine in this recipe.  After mixing the ground beef, we let it set for a half hour in the fridge before making the patties to let the flavors come together.  These burgers came out very moist and juicy.  We will definitely make these again.  They were perfect on a toasted roll with melted cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion.",

Turned out to be the best burgers we've had yet. I made them thick and big and he still had 2 AND put 2 more away to take to work tomorrow! Definitely strong compliments coming from him. \nWill be making these for him again. They were also a hit with my grandparents. My parents are upset they didn't get invited! \nThe whiskey adds a little bit of a bite to the burger, and the beer helps make them nice and juicy, even if you prefer yours more on the well-done side. \nI used Karl Strauss Amber Lager. \nThese will be a fun summer hit for sure!",
