The easiest way to make these cups though, is to use some sort of squeeze bottle, or maybe even a pastry bag with a big pipe on the end to fill the cups. First, line your cups with the paper. Form balls of the PB mixture by warming about a teaspoon of the dough in your hands and rolling it into a ball. Fill a squeeze bottle with chocolate, squeeze a bottom into all of the cups, place a peanut butter ball in the middle of the chocolate and then squeeze the remaining chocolate in around the sides and tops of the cups. You can whip these out so fast this way, and they look very professional...and they taste good too!",

After making these and finding somethings out the hard way I have a couple of modifications:  make the peanut butter filling first and let it cool while painting the cups.  I also melted the chips in two batches, otherwise the chocolate hardens before you get to use it for the top layer.  If using stovetop watch carefully \u2013 if the chocolate gets too hot it will seize and not melt!! I melted 1 c chips and 1 T shortening in microwave for 1 minute, stirred and microwaved for additional 30 seconds or until melted and smooth.  After painting the cups I let them chill and then formed the cooled  peanut butter filling into 30 little discs the size of quarters.  The  filing was kind of hard and crumbly, but just warm it up in your had for a second and it gets easy to work with. (I also had enough filling to make 60 cups, not just 30!) I put a disc in each cup then placed the cups in a jelly roll pan (or something w/ sides), melted the 2nd half of the chocolate chips, spooned about \u00bd t melted chocolate on top of the filling and then after finishing every 4 or 5 cups I tapped the pan on the table to even the chocolate out and remove air bubbles - this gave it a perfectly smooth finish and professional look!",

I put mine into an icing bag and use that to squeeze the filling in, it's quick and easy. Once they are all filled I cover with the remaining chocolate, also from an icing bag.
