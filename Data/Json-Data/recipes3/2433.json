I also added the chili powder and cumin as suggested by others. I went a little further and added a can of chopped green chilies and replaced the tomatoes with 24 oz. of salsa. I used rotini bacause I didn't have and macaroni noodles. After it was done I topped it with crushed tortilla chips cheese sour cream olives and taco sauce. Then I added chopped cilantro as a final garnish. It was delicious and dissappeared quickly. Thanks for the great recipe. We will make this one a lot.",
