I cooked the mixture over an hour and a half checking the potatoes every 15 minutes after the initial 30 minutes to ensure they were softened. I tasted for seasoning and added two teaspoons of Emeril's Cajun spice mixture (recipe for spice mixture at FoodNetwork.com) and tripled the hot sauce before adding the catfish. I have never eaten fish in a stew or soup but since I'm trying to incorporate more fish into my diet I wanted to give this recipe a try. The texture of the fish was strange to me at first. I have to say it smelled wonderful while cooking. I almost used olive oil and left the bacon out to save calories and make it healthier. I decided to go ahead and stay as close as possible to the recipe as written. I love bacon in anything but I was surprised the scrumptious undertone the bacon gave to this recipe. I'm sure that accounts for the hike in calories. Oh well I'll try olive oil next time. I think chicken or pork could be substituted for catfish in this recipe with very good results.",
