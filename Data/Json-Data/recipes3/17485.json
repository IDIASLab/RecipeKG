I've included a basic recipe, but feel free to use your family's favorite. Use pearl onions in place of the olives for a different look. The layer of crushed French-fried onions will resemble burnt fur! When you slice it, the 'guts' should ooze out and make quite an impression.",

The one thing that didn't work for me was the cheese. I checked it after an hour of bake time and the 5 minute rest and it hadn't even begun to melt. I put him back in for another 30 minutes which way overcooked the onions on top and the cheese still never melted. This was fun and something the kiddo's are bound to enjoy but I recommend using a better melting cheese such as American or Mozzarella.",

I used \"HI\" to start - but after about 30 minutes the top burnt. I switched to \"LO\" at the 45 minute mark - and kept cooking an extra 15 minutes. The middle bottom half was not cooked thoroughly. So next time I would halve the amounts (it's pretty huge) and cook for same time or 1hr 15 on a \"LO\" broil. OR keep as is and cook for 45 minutes on 'LO\" and switch to high at the last 20 minutes. It's also Impossible (for me) to figure out if the cheese was melted without destroying the rat. Maybe the recipe owners have some suggestions?",
