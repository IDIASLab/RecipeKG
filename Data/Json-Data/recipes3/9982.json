I made 1/4 of the recipe and got 6 medium size pancakes. My one issue was with the onion--I chopped it finely but I think it would have been better to grate it. I liked the flavor of the onion but I didn't really care for the little bits of it in the pancake. Also I think maple sausage would be wonderful in these! Oh I just realized I didn't sift my dry ingredients; I skipped that when reading the recipe. It didn't seem to make a difference; they rose nicely.",
