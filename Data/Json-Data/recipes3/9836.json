We have made this with regular vegetable oil and white vinegar as well and it works well.  I would however add a little sugar to the oil/vinegar to sweeten the slaw just a bit.  A bit of fresh ground pepper never hurt either.  All in all a great recipe.",

Searching for foods that would be diet helpful several sites (academic sites as well as homeopathic)mentioned that raw or lightly cooked cabbage is a good choice. It also mentioned olive oil so I looked for those ingredients. I happened to have rice vinegar with basil and oregano seasoning so I used it. While it is not my preferred cole slaw recipe I think it fit my needs and I will be having it a lot.",
