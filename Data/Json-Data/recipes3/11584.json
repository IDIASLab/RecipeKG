The flavors here were great. We picked up the fennel from our neighbors farm so it was super fresh and it pared perfectly with the fennel. To me this seems like an unlikely combination but it worked! Thank you for a great recipe and thank you Uncle Ben's for making a great rice blend. I can't say enough about the flavor combination here!",
