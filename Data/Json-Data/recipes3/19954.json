Instead of just the 2 cups of spinach, I use the entire bag of baby spinach leaves and add a couple of button mushrooms, sliced thinly. I sear my boneless, skinless chicken breasts first (sprinkled with creole seasoning/cayenne pepper for spiciness), and once they are cooked through I set them aside, wrapped in tin foil, until everything else is done, then chop them into bite sized pieces and toss them in the sauce. The chicken stays very moist and tender this way. I also like to throw some diced tomato (lightly salted) on top before serving. So delicious.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best pasta dishes I've found on this site - definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!!!",

I use home made \"Lite Alfredo\" sauce and home made Pesto. Add any vegetable you want, onion and mushrooms are excellent. Use any pasta on hand.  Always use more garlic than called for and definitely more Spinach than suggested (5 oz tub works well).  Prawns and/or chicken work great. Add Parmesan or other cheese if you like.  Everyone loves this dish, in any form!! BTW, I agree w/ calizen on the seasonings (Jerk et al) then searing as well...I actually do that too. It up seasons the chicken to my liking.",

I used sun dried tomato pesto, a whole bag of baby spinach, added onion in when I sauted the chicken, added sun dried tomatoes when I added the baby spinach and used 1 cup of four cheese alfredo sauce.  Next time, I will cut back the sauce to 3/4 cup.  But, I will make again and again! Thank you for the recipe!",

First, olive oil on medium-high heat is enough to completely blacken minced garlic-- as I found out quickly enough. Second, one should absolutely add as much spinach as one can get one's hands on-- the amount called for in the recipe, once wilted, is next to none, especially for those like me who find the spinach the most appetizing part of the recipe to begin with. And, make sure your pesto is very fresh-- mine wasn't and therefore did not add the lovely pungent flavor I was expecting. Otherwise, preparation was relatively easy and straightforward, and the number of ingredients few enough that I will try it again, hopefully with a better end result. Thanks for posting!",
