Fresh pineapple with its accumulated juices makes a tasty, less sweet version.  Brown sugar can be used instead of golden syrup - or honey, sweetener of choice and to taste.  Good recipe with shrimps instead of chops of chicken pieces.  Very versatile recipe with many riffs possible.  Thank you!!",

I love to cook however I do not care for pork that much. My boyfriend loves pork chops so I always look for an interesting way to cook them and these came out great! The pork was not dry and there was a lot of flavor. Like any cook I cannot follow a recipe word for word and I always have to add a twist so here is what I did: I did not have the curry so I just used some salt pepper garlic powder and a dash of Soulard Grill seasoning. I only simmered for about 20 minutes and then added the pineapple and raisins and a pat of butter for about 10. I used golden raisins which were great however use whatever kind you like! Didn t have golden syrup so I used some good maple syrup from Funk s Grove. Good Stuff! I also used fresh ginger instead of powder because that is all that I had. I suggest adding the ginger to your tasting use less or more depending how much you love it. I also added a little more pineapple I like fruit. I have also in the past added a dash of coconut rum silver rum or some good old Captain Morgan. Just a splash will do but it does add some flavor! You could also add some sweet potatoes it is a great little twist with an awesome complimenting flavor. I would recommend this to anyone I know the combination of ingredients sounds strange but this is an awesome dish! Serve with some potatoes a salad rice and a v",
