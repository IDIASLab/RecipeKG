The only thing I will chime in with is that as long as the pumpkin will fit in your bakind dish, and in your oven, there is no reason to cut it first. Save yourself some fingers, and after puncturing it a few times with a fork, bake it whole until it is tender enough to stab through with a fork. Then allow it to cool before you cut it in half. You will find cutting it to be much easier, and often the stem will pull right off.",

You do need to make sure that you drain off as much water as possible after you puree the pumkin, though, or your recipies will be too watery.  I put mine in a colander lined with cheesecloth and it worked well.  I then measured 2 cups of puree and put it in bags and froze them to make recipies later.  \r\n\r\nFYI:  Cheese pumpkins are the ***BEST TASTING*** baking pumpkins, but the small sugar pumpkins work okay, too.\r\n",

Cook a pumpkin in the oven with beef stew inside (Heaven be sure to add a turnip to the soup really brings out the flavors!) this is the perfect recipe for everyone to start with...
