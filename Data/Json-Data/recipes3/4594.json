But the concerns about drying out the\npotatoes and cauliflower are justified.  To solve this, during the times when\none is supposed to cook with the pan covered, make sure there is a little water at \n\nthe bottom of the pan.  Every few minutes uncover and add a little water.  This\nmakes sure everything stays damp and steams as it cooks.  I found it necessary\nto steam for an extra 5-10 minutes to cook the potatoes sufficiently.\nAlso, I used 50% more spices than listed.  Salt I added to taste *at the end*,\nnot where recommended in the recipe.  (How would one decide if something tastes\nright before the vegetables are done cooking?)

What is with the coconut milk though? If you want traditional aloo gobi, stop taking one reviewer's suggestion and don't add coconut milk. It's not part of this dish, and if you add it, you're making something completely different, and most likely, something sweet. Mustard seeds are always a great addition and the more cilantro the better, but if you find that it's too dry, add a 1/2 cup of crushed tomatoes and it will be perfect!",

It is supposed to be very dry; not all Indian recipies are intended to have a sauce!! I found the flavor however to be fairly bland though not disagreeable. This is a minimal recipe that would be good to use on a day-to-day basis not for company. The exclusion of onions is also regrettable since that eliminates a lot of the traditional flavor. the paprika is a little different from other Aloo Gobi versions I have tried but I would probably use less of it and add a little more zing via green chili peppers in my own version.",

Cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours (after the first 30 minutes I added the Cauliflower stirring to saturate with the spices. I added a little more milk (maybe 1/4 cup or less) after 2 hrs and stirred. The cooking time will depend on how big you cut the potatoes I cubed them about 1-2\" wide.

A couple of suggestions - cut the potatoes smaller than the cauliflower as they take longer to cook. Cover and cook over slow heat. Add cilantro after the vegetables have cooked and allow to heat through. This allows the fresh flavour to remain. Gobi Aloo is meant to be dry - it is not a curry so pls don't follow other reviews of adding coconut milk.",

I realized that the colour wasn't catching on to all of the cauliflower... just the tops and bottoms. I used half of a big cauliflower which might have been more than a pound. I added tomatoes (which you really should put in) and one cup of water. The water made it lose a bit of flavour and it was still dry. So after reading the other reviews I added 1/2 can coconut milk and that made a good curry base. Also I didn't have cilantro so I used parsley instead which worked well. In total I put in twice the amount of spices that the recipe asked for for the half a cauliflower I used. This makes the curry rich and flavourful. You need to simmer the dish on low for about 20 minutes longer as well. In the end...it turned out great!",

To the reviewers who skipped the asafoetida while asafoetida does not appear to really add anything to the taste it's a traditional digestive added to Indian recipes.
