I started the recipe and wasn't sure where it was going to end up since the recipe offered two suggestions for the lobster itself. The only addition I made was to add some tomato paste to thicken up. No need to read further the recipe works completely as is.\n\nCouple of thoughts - First I used shears to cut the bottom of the lobster tails before cooking with two thoughts in mind.  First it will let some more lobster seep into the sauce, second, I am going to have to open the lobster tail at some point so this was a good place to start.  Then I followed the recipe completely but pulled the lobster tails out about 45 min during the simmering.  I stirred and pressed the sauce and added two Tablespoons of Tomato Paste to thicken it up.  I cut the tops of the shells and pulled out the meat.  I cubed the lobster meat and put it back in the sauce for the remainder of time. Again the recipe works great as written these were just some observations.",

I cook with fresh all natural or organic ingredients so the flavors blended wonderfully and I also left the lobster in for the full cooking time to add to the flavor like the recipe stated. I will make this again; I made just a small handful of cappellini pasta and tossed it in the mix with the lobster meat right before serving yum!",
