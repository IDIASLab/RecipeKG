Some recommendations to share this was intended to be a vegan burger but I recommend adding egg for those who are not strictly vegan. Also when frying after placing patty onto the pan wait about a minute or two and then cover so you can get the steam-fry effect cripsy on the outside and moist (and cooked) on the inside.

I added one little can of red beets including juice for color and flavor and mixed it in a blender along with the tofu. I didn't add cooked rice because of the ingreased moisture from the beets. I added a whole cup of uncooked bulgur wheat(didn't have oat bran) and a whole cup of oats. I added a lot of Tex Mex spice and put it in the fridge overnight. The consistency was great the next day to shape little meatballs. They browned nicely and tasted great. To finalize it I added a jar of tomato sauce and served it with pasta. Next time I will make it with oat bran and the BBQ sauce which I didn't have either. Hope this helps.",
