I'm making an actual pink princess cake tomorrow for a coworker's daughter, so I took this recipe for a test drive today. Turned out moist, tasty, and pink (PLENTY pink enough). I was worried about having big, wet strawberry chunks in places, but the strawberries got mashed and distributed through the batter while mixing. I'm definitely going to use this recipe again tomorrow,  - and am reaping the rewards of my 'test' tonight with whipped cream, strawberries, and chocolate syrup. Thanks! ",
