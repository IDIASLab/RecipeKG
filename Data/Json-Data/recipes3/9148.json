I started by simply following the directions but after doing all the chopping dicing cutting etc this whole dish took on a different life of its own! I said screw it and made this into a main meal! After rummaging around in my chest freezer I took out two bags of skinless boneless chicken breasts. I had 5 breast halves so after thawing I diced them all and saut\u00e9ed the meat is butter and added 1 medium onion. I also added a cajun seasoning to give the chicken some pop. While the meat was simmering I 'hotrodded' the base of this 'salad'. Mayo sour cream and one cup of Ranch mixed together and mixed into the elbow macaroni. I decided that as long as I'm now making this into a main dish I added three quarter bag of grated sharp cheddar cheese. After the chicken was cooked down into the mix it went! I've got to say it turned out great!",

GREAT salad to make a day ahead just add some milk to give it extra moisture before serving (if needed.) The macaroni absorbs the dressing!",
