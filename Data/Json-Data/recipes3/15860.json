I really wouldn't change much with this except maybe to use a bit less dill - 1 & 1/2 Tbsp. next time. This is a definite keeper when you want a quick great tasting potato salad.",

I added a lot more dill (I used fresh) celery salt Jane s Krazy Mixed Up Salt and some thinly sliced radishes and celery. There was also a little too much mayonnaise for my liking so I mellowed out the tang with more sour cream. Basic recipes are nice to build upon but they should also stand alone on their own merits without tinkering being necessary.",
