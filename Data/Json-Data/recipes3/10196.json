                "reviewBody": "I really hate to do this but as written I can only give this a 3 at most. The biggest issue with this soup is that it was entirely too salty and I love salt. I would recommend leaving out the teaspoon of salt and use low sodium chicken broth. I think tortilla chips would have been a nice garnish but not the kind from the bag because that is just more salt. The chicken really held the spice mix flavor the way the directions had you do it but on the bad note you end up with a very oily soup to the point you can see it floating on top of your bowl and it leaves a coating on your spoon. My last complaint is actually an easy fix and that is that there simply was not enough substance. There was a perfect amount of chicken and tomatoes but you really had to fish around to find any beans. I would definitely recommend adding another can of beans and be sure to rinse. All in all this had a really deep rich flavor and was super simple to prepare but for what it is worth I just think it needs some adjustments.",

Instead of pinto beans I added a can of Ranch Style beans & Bush's Grillin' Beans Black Bean Fiesta gravy and all. I did omit the tsp salt and am glad I did. I didn' t have any tomato sauce so so I improvised by taking a half can of tomato paste and adding water to make 1 cup. The seasoning on the chicken was outstanding. I added the oil to the bottom of the pot and spread it all around coating the sides as well. After 4 hrs I shredded the chicken breasts and put the meat back in the pot for two more hours. Perfection! I made the cheddar bay biscuits (a la Red Lobster) to serve alongside. I will surely be making this recipe again.",
