There wasn't enough cheese in it, it came out really dry and hard on top, and exactly how much salt and pepper should I put in it? I didn't know how much I should put in, I put in a little bit - and it was bland. I was scared I would put in too much if I kept adding more. The cheese mixture wasn't creamy, but more curdy like others had mentioned. It's a good base recipe, but next time I will add more cheese, re-guesstimate how much salt to add, and cover it while baking to help prevent that rock-hard layer of pasta on top, then maybe brown it under the broiler quickly. Leaving the oven on bake to brown dried it out, I think.",

But I tried it anyway cause my fiance and I love mac and cheese, this recipe turned out great it wasn't at all clumpy , to dry or anything else that I read on here. The only changes I made were I added 4 cups of mozzarella and cheddar (2cups of each) and baked it for 50 minutes (covered the first  20) I also stirred it a couple times.  Thank you so much for this recipe I will definitely be making this again..",

I only added a few things: I stirred 1/4 tsp. creole seasoning and about 1/8 tsp. cayenne along with the salt & pepper in the milk mixture. I used a little more colby-jack cheese  than noted, and reserved a little handful to top the macaroni before going into the oven.  After baking for 30 minutes, I topped the macaroni with buttered Italian-style bread crumbs (almost a cup of crumbs and 2 Tbsp. melted butter) and baked the last 10 minutes.  Zippier than average macaroni, but still recognizable and very comforting.  Perfect!",
