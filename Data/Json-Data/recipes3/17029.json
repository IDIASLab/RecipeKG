        "description": "The hardest line cook job I ever had was at the Carnelian Room, where on a busy night I'd prepare over 250 steaks and chops. The biggest challenge was frying French potato puffs to order. Called pommes dauphine, it's one of the finest foods ever invented. To save your kitchen from that deep fryer smell, I wanted to try a baked version. I was very happy with the results. Even though they weren't as dark and crispy as the fried version, the inside was virtually identical. Enjoy these as a warm snack with a dip, or to go alongside some eggs or grilled steak.",

I made a half-batch and added chives. The only thing I did differently was to preheat the muffin tin and add a dollop of butter  so when I dropped in the batter (pre-portioned and set aside on parchment paper) they fried nicely on the bottom, like Yorkshire Puddings. In the time it took them to bake and cool I was able to cook the steaks and make the red wine sauce, finish off the green beans, sear the tomatoes, and broil the scallops so everything was done together. These puffs are very tasty (pictured in a cluster of 3, upside down to the left), can be prepped ahead, and present well on the plate.",

I made a test batch ahead of time and added fresh grated sharp white cheddar to some.  The cheese ones were great (a little salty), and my husband's favorite, but I felt their flavor was too much for the meal I had planned so I ended up making them per the recipe on Christmas day.  I did doubled the recipe, but only used 3 eggs, and they turned out perfect.  Great for mopping up that  yummy pan sauce! Make sure you taste your dough before you put it in the muffin pan, and add salt if needed...there is no way to salt them afterwards.  I will definitely be making these again.",

In fact I made Scotch eggs by Chef John's recipe. I'd highly recommend a Fry Daddy or something of that nature b/c it was impossible to get the oil in a pot on my stove to cook w/o burning them but then again I need a better stove. If I had the money I'd already have been to Sears & bought one of their high-end stoves now that they're on such deep discount w/Sears closing stores. But I digress. The entire meal turned out wonderful w/exception of having to switch to the deep fryer. If I'd had more potatoes I'd have drop fried a couple of them. Hwr I'll have a large bag of potatoes come tomorrow this time. Hubby's hooked!",
