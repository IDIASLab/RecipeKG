I went to Houston's last week and got a rough recipe from the bartender that was essentially the same \u2013 she didn\u2019t know any measurements, but the ingredients were consistent with the recipe listed on this website.  According to her, they boil the artichokes for 20 minutes and then refrigerate them for 1 hour before grilling.  I just tried the recipe at home (incorporating these instructions) and they came out great.  Because I am limited to an oven, I broiled the artichokes on high, as closely to the burners as possible (without touching of course), for approximately 20 minutes.  This gave them the nice charred look and flavor on the outside.  Hope this helps those without access to a grill.  ",

I've made these a couple times now and will continue to use this recipe. Living in an apartment however outdoor grilling is not really possible for me but I thought broiling these in the oven also worked well. (I made the mistake of placing them too close to the broiler at first... with all the oil on them that's probably not a good idea--I moved them to a lower rack to be on the safe side). Broiling does not give them the same charred look or quite the same flavor as grilling but is still good for a second-best method. Also rather than cutting the artichokes in half before boiling them I boiled them whole first for longer (30 minutes) then drained them and let them cool for a few minutes before cutting them and then basting and broiling. Just my personal preference.",
