I only used 6 oz. of yogurt because that's the size the whole milk brand I found comes in. It was plenty to give the pasta a nice coating. Update: I've now been to Turkey and had real manti...where I was they did drain them. Manti are really tiny but the ravioli are a fair substitute taste-wise. I still think this is a great recipe.
