The only slight deviation I made was to saut\u00e9 the tomatoes first, then add the spinach, since spinach only takes under a minute to wilt down and cook.  I added the seasonings in with the spinach, instead of after the spinach was cooked. Since spinach wilts down so much, I consider this more 1 serving instead of 2. Tip of the night: Make lots!!! You'll regret it if you don't! This one's a keeper. Thanks Amy for sharing your hubby's recipe!",
