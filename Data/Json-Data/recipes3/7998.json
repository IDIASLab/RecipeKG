I was pre-composing a review as I prepared this dish about how wonderful it is to discover a unique combination of ingredients that would never have occurred to you but somehow work well together. I won't get to use that review here. I'll try the tzatziki as a marinade again because that seems a solid recommendation that I'd never tried but perhaps with different ancillary spices as a tablespoon of cumin seemed to overwhelm the more delicate flavors of the tzatziki. It wasn't bad by any means it just didn't meet my hopeful expectations.",
