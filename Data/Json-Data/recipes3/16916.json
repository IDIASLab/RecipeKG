I made the recipe as written baked for 20 minutes they were totally dry and crumbled when I tried to cut them and the peanut butter flavor was nonexistent. It really took some muscle to even blend this mixture by hand and I thought at the time that maybe this needed more moisture?? I struggled to even get anything out of the entire baking dish that resembled a whole bar for a photograph. Although I can t eat these like I eat a granola bar I will be able to use it as a crumble on morning yogurt so all is not lost. Sorry for the less than favorable first review but this just didn't work for me. I've made probably close to 10 granola bar recipes on this site but won't be making this again.",
