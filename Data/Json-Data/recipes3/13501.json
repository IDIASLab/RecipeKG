They were not dry and they tasted good but they didn't look as appetizing as I was expecting. I am not vegan but was given some vegan products to try out. I'm not sure if that is just how they are or if this recipe just needed more of them. I definitely think it could benefit from some vegan butter but overall a good recipe.",
