My filling did turn out a little watery so I had to add some breadcrumb to make sure it stayed in the slipper while baking. My slippers were good and drained but maybe I should have drained some of the excess water off of the zucchini flesh too. This is a great way to use up your harvest from the garden!",

After reading a couple reviews and the recipe I agreed that this would need breadcrumbs so I added 1/4 cup. Also added 1 minced clove of garlic and 2 tbsp of grated parmesan cheese as the recipe itself looked a little dull in flavour. I made them ahead of time in the morning (stuffed and all) and put them in the fridge until dinner time. I added about 10 minutes cooking time. Next time I think I would do them on 375F instead of 350F",
