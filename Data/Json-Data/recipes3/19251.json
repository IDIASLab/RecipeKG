The best way to make this is one can of warm coke heinz catsup start with equal amounts then to taste simmer for about a half and hour and stir so it won't burn. Let it sit in the frig overnight and it will thicken it up. By putting it in the frig the catsup and coke mesh really well sometimes I add mushrooms and onions it is excellent. It is great with Patty LaBelles macaroni and cheese. Beware of calories great comfort food.:-)",

So the third time I tried to liven it up with 2 cloves garlic 1/2 a minced onion 1/2 a minced green pepper white pepper and a dash of worstershire sauce. The additions actually made it worse.
