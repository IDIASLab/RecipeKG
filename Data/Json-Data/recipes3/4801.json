This is an old family tried and true recipe that my sister discovered thru a friend many years ago. In my family we bake it in the oven, so good for people who don't like to grill. Great for serving to big parties cuz people just go crazy for it and will ask for the recipe.  Using a dry rub and add a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, marinate overnite. The brown sugar balances out the saltiness of the rub. Make sure the meat is room temperature, and with the fat side up, bake in a 450 oven for 25 minutes. Then with the meat still in the oven, turn oven down to 350 and cook another 25 minutes for medium rare. If you want medium, leave in another 5 minutes. Do not cover with foil while baking, and make sure when it's done to leave it on the counter for 15 minutes to rest before slicing thin. If you don't let it rest, all the juice runs out and looks messy and dries out the meat.   Served best with a salad and baked potato. Enjoy!   This will be the most tastiest and easiest beef you've ever eaten. Most beef roasts take hours to bake, perfect for an after work dinner that you throw in the oven with baked potatoes and leave it alone. Always comes out perfect.",

I did leave the rub on for almost 24 hours and the only thing I changed was to use granulated garlic instead of garlic salt, which worked out fine because this is a salty rub. We even accidentally cooked this a bit too long and it was still superb. I ran to the store to buy another tri-tip while they were still on sale so that I could make this again--soon. I will never cook a tri-tip any other way, now. Awesome!",
