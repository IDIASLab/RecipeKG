I then added additional soy sauce and chile-garlic sauce to kick up the flavor a bit and actually did that one more time. First one thing the recipe doesn t tell you to do is cover the pot when you re simmering the pork-rice mixture. You absolutely have to do this otherwise your rice will never cook. After 20 minutes I still had uncooked rice so I added more chicken broth and it took another 8-10 minutes before the rice was finally cooked. My husband found the snow peas too crunchy so perhaps even add them to the pot for the last five minutes when cooking the rice rather than at the very end. I had high hopes for this recipe but felt a little let down because it really just didn t have much flavor. We even added sriracha sauce at the table. It was just OK but doubtful I lll make again.",
