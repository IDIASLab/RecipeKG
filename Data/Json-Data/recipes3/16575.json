Instead of ll mayo I used half mayo and half sour cream. Personally I just think mayo is too sweet for my tastes. The mushrooms: I used fresh portebellos that I sauteed up...so they probably had more flavor than the canned ones. Spinach: I used 16 oz as I had a one pound bunch of fresh spinach from the market. I cooked and drained it. HERE is where the folks that got runny sauce probably ran into trouble. Spinach is mostly water/it shrinks a lot/a lot of water comes out of it with cooking. Weather using fresh or frozen...it's really important that it is drained well before putting it in a sauce....not just drip dry....you need to SQUEEZE the water out of it.....or else yes....it will make stuff watery. I left the boiled eggs out as I just personally hate hard boiled eggs. I used 3/4 cup of cheese since that is what I had on hand/just tossed it all in. The major thing to me is the spice. It ended up bland and I added more spices that majorly amped up the flavor: 2 tsp of Old Bay plus 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes.",
