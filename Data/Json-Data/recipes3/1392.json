Hubby and I have never had limoncello before, but the local liquor store had a coupon, so we decided to try it.  It's wonderful - think Lemon Head candy in liquid form!  This drink is a great combo of ingredients.  I did cut the pom juice down to only 2 oz. so it wouldn't overpower the limoncello, and it was just right.  My favorite brand of juice is Pom Wonderful, it has the best color and flavor.  Thank you so much for this drink recipe!",
