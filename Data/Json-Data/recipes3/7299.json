I doubled the amount of veggies and even added julienned carrots and a can of corn. However I kept the dressing amount the same (minus the garlic salt but adding 2 chopped garlic cloves) with one major change: instead of a cup and a half of olive oil I used a half of a cup. If I were to have used that much oil I would have had to throw all of the vegetables away because they would have been DROWNED in oil. I gave it four stars because of this but the vegetables I made were very much deserving of a five and I will make them often for parties. I only blanched my beans for a minute and they were crisp yet slightly tender.",

It is awesome and I always get requests in the summer for this. One star removed because ITA with the reviewer that said way too much oil. I have always made it w/1/2 or 1/4 C oil. Also...although olive oil is tastier I find that if you refrigerate this salad (and it is much better if refrigerated overnight) OO gets kind of thick and greasy. Regular salad oil works better IMN. Overall though...delicious recipe one of my faves.",
