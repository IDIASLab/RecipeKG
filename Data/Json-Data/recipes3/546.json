While the recipe is a good basic one to build on I made the following changes: I changed it to serve 4; made 2 cups of chicken gravy instead of using the soup and refrigerated it to let it congeal a bit before adding a portion of it to the croquette mixture; sauteed the onion and celery before adding to the mixture; substituted panko crumbs; refrigerated the 8 oval patties/croquettes I made for several hours before dusting them with flour dipping in egg/milk then coating in the crumbs (seasoned with a little poultry seasoning kosher salt and pepper); I baked them at 375 degrees for 35 minutes. I also added just a pinch of poultry seasoning to the gravy I made and served the croquettes with mashed potatoes and wax beans.",

First there is no suggestion of using a NON-STICK skillet to brown the croquettes. It was really frustrating to take a large skillet as directed and when flipping the croquettes have the browned breading come right off sticking to the pan. After one turn I transferred them into a non-stick skillet and it worked much better. My second gripe is the amount of poultry seasoing in the croquettes. There is far too much for this amount of chicken breadcrumbs etc. If I were to make this recipe again I would cut the 1/4 tsp of poultry seasoning that goes in the meat mixture to 1/8 tsp. Overall the textures of this was great but the over powering flavor of too much poultry seasoning ruined it for me. Maybe if I do make this agin with less seasoning it will turn out how I expected/wanted it to and I will be ableto come back and give it a higher rating but until then I wouldn't recommend it:(",
