Additionally, the honey sauce made for an awfully thick, sticky, dental filling-removing glaze once baked.  I *might* try these again with significant changes: use drumsticks for a better meat-to-glaze ratio, don't bother double-dredging in cornstarch (one coat will likely do), halve the honey to make a less sweet, less sticky glaze.  I was hoping to have a change-up from the hot wings my husband likes, and we both really enjoyed how crunchy these came out, but it was a little sweet for us.",
