The instructions don't indicate that you should first cream the butter before adding the eggs. Also it would benefit from sugar. Traditional biscotti recipes start w/ 2 parts flour to 1 part sugar. I may play around with this and see if I can improve upon it. So far I've halved the amount of cinnamon and added a 1 tsp of vanilla. Still the cookies are very bland.",
