The only thing I did differently was throw all of the seasonings into the food processor as I was prepping enough for 3 pounds of lamb and was running out of room with the mortar and pestle when I went to add the garlic. That really sped up the process. Next time all the spices are going into the food processor as soon as I am done grinding the salt and fennel. There most definitely will be a next time too! The flavor was totally unique from anything I have had before. It wasn't anywhere near as spicy as I thought it would be. The smell as the sausages were cooking was amazing.  One piece of advice, I got a ton of splatter cooking this on my stove, worth it, but next time I'm going to cook it in a larger saute pan that I have a splatter guard for.",

My husband is from the South of France where they eat merguez frites and merguez sandwiches as frequently as we eat cheeseburgers. He made merguez for me once and now I'm hooked too! The only downside is that we have to go to this special import store to buy them and they are always frozen. I discovered your recipe and made merguez burgers for his birthday. This recipe is outstanding!!! The burgers taste like perfectly prepared merguez - super flavorful juicy and a little spicy! I'm making them again tonight because we just can't get enough of them. Thank you again! I wish I could give you 10 stars!",

I made it with out the turmeric and Harisa sauce and used a spice grinder to grind my fennel and coriander seeds. Since I didn't have the Harisa sauce and not likely to find it in my area I looked it up online and found it was some of the same spices we were already using and chili pepper seeds along with red bell peppers. I substituted a tablespoon of Cajun Spice for the hot spice and it worked well for us. We tested two different recipes to decide what to do with 22 pounds of ground lamb and mixed the two recipes so it all went into the freezer as sausage.",
