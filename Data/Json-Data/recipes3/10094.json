Just add a nice piece of fruit and you have the perfect brunch. I'm surely going to buy some Canadian bacon and make these for the whole family. Thanks Occasional Cooker, another winning recipe.",

The main thing I changed was that I used 6 hard boiled eggs rather than 3. I did it exactly the way the recipe called for initially, but after looking at the mixture, it looked like egg soup! There was so much sauce it was ridiculous. So I boiled three more eggs and added them to the mixture and it seemed perfect at six eggs to the amount of sauce. The other thing I changed was just eliminating the bacon altogether since I am a vegetarian. I opted to add a few slices of tomato and replace meant of that. Will definitely make this again with additional variations!",
