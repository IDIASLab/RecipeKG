The only things I'd add is to melt a half-stick of paraffin with the chocolate so that the chocolate doesn't scorch as easily and to make the finished product shinier. I also use toothpicks to dip each ball into the chocolate mixture so that the process goes more quickly. When the chocolate dries slightly I twist and pull the toothpick upward to remove it then dip a spoon into the chocolate and dab each ball with the spoon. I've seen some people cover the toothpick hole with a pecan (as the photo in the main recipe shows) but sometimes the extra nut detracts from the overall creaminess of the bourbon ball and the chopped walnuts inside each ball provide plenty of a nutty taste. I've packaged these treats in Christmas tins as holiday gifts and they are ALWAYS a huge hit!",

Here\u2019s what I did:\n\nBeat butter on high until creamy.  Stop mixer, add powered sugar and \u201cstir\u201d to combine. Increase speed to high and beat until it is fine, dry and crumbly (like pie dough before the water).  Add the bourbon-infused pecans and stir until mixed (will look like stiff cookie dough).  My pecans soaked for 5 days, absorbed most of the bourbon and doubled in size.  Chill in fridge for a short while.\n\nForm into small balls (1/2\u201d to 5/8\u201d wide made about 65 balls).  My palms became sticky but I scraped them clean with a spoon. The balls will also be sticky, so put them in the freezer to harden.  After 15-30 min you can quickly roll them again and they will become smooth and round.  Keep in freezer until you\u2019re ready to dip them.\n\nMelt chocolate (I used unsweetened with short bursts in the microwave, stirring often).  Insert toothpick 1/4\u201d into frozen ball and dip part way into the melted chocolate while spooning some over the top.  Using the spoon for support, lift the ball and place on waxed paper.  Remove toothpick after a few minutes and put in refrigerator.\n\nI covered the toothpick hole with a dab of chocolate but next time I\u2019d like to pipe on a holly leaf and red berries. I also used melted white chocolate chips but had to add Paramount Crystals to thin the chocolate.  \n\nThank you, I'll make these again !!",

I would add \"with a mixer, blend the butter and powder sugar. This will produce a lumpy powdery mixture. Then, work this mixture together with your hands, kneading it to a stiff dough-like consistency.\" It is also important to note that 2 cups of powdered sugar do not equal 16 oz. You must go by weight, which isn't too difficult if you purchase a 2 pound bag of powdered sugar and eyeball it. \nWe made a triple batch of these and the sugar quantity when tripled was still dead on correct. Soaked our coarsely ground nuts for a few days in a mason jar using Maker's Mark, then drained them quickly when adding to the filling. Good bourbon is definitely important! I do not normally enjoy bourbon balls, or bourbon in general for that matter, but these are great! We made them for my father's 70th birthday and he is very pleased!",
