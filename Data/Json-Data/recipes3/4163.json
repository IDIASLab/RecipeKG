I must admit however that what I made may not be very close to the original because I had to make alterations to lower the fat and especially the salt. Since the pesto mix counted for 400mg sodium per tablespoon I decided to adapt it (only I didn't pay attention to the seasonings in it). This is what I did: instead of the mix I used about 3/4 of a 5.5oz jar basil in water 1/4 cup ground pine nuts 1 cup skim milk 2 large cloves of garlic minced 1 T. olive oil 1T. corn starch in the hopes of thickening the sauce and put all 1/4 c. Parmesan cheese into to sauce. I left extra Parmesan cheese out for family members to sprinkle on top. Everything turned out well except for the thin sauce but perhaps I could heat it before adding it to the mushrooms tofu and olives. I'm going to continue to \"play\" with this recipe using different milk seasonings etc. but will definitely make it again and again. (No one even noticed the tofu and since I didn't say it was in the meal everyone was happy!) Thanks Veronica!",

I suggest making small cubes from the tofu to make everything more bite-sized. Also I browned the tofu for about 25 minutes which gave a nice crispy outer edge.
