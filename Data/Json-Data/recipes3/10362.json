I use center cut bacon and instead of microwaving it I partially cooked it in a skillet, crisping up just one side.  The bacon was still flexible and just the right length to circle the muffin tins.  I put just a little of the filling into each cup and baked for about 4 minutes so the top of the egg was just starting to set and then added the remaining toppings - this way they didn't all sink to the bottom.  At 15 minutes they were puffed and set.  I turned off the oven, topped with a little cheese and just left them in the off oven to melt the cheese.  They came out of the muffin pans very easily and clean up was minimal.  Easy to customize to use whatever you have and like.  Green onions would be a great addition.  Thanks for a great breakfast.",
