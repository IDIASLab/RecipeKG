Found no need for adding butter before the chicken & obviously from my pic we don't always use mushrooms. It's just a matter of being in the mood to add them or what we have in the pantry. I'm also not sure why it says to have COOKED chicken. I never pre-cook or even cut the chicken in small pieces. I did use use a little PAM on my glass dish. While using an expensive wine can enhance any dish I've had great results using the cheapest wine at the store. I use fat free evaporated milk any cream of chicken or mushroom and don't be scared off by the mayo b/c you won't be able to taste it. I also use (any flavor) Almond Accents to go on top (found next to the fresh salads) and can't imagine NOT adding them to the dish. It's that good!! This goes great with potatoes on the side and I use the honey potato recipe (1 lb red potatoes quartered 1T butter 3T honey and 1t dry mustard - bake 40 min). The salad in my pic is just romaine with sliced strawberries and of course more almond accents and we sometimes sprinkle dried blueberries and cranberries on top. Every toddler that comes over loves this fruit salad. Yummy!",

(I replaced the mayo with sour cream) I increased the white wine and sour cream to make up for the milk. (I didn't measure just eye balled it) Also I didn't use the almonds. Anyway we loved this. I served it with Sour Cream and Chive Mashed Potatoes from this web site. Yummy! Thanx so much for sharing this recipe!",

I think next time I'll try 2% cheddar cheese. With that change it if works this can become a regular meal rather than just for a special occasion. I also suggest that the mayonaise be added right before the sauce is taken off the heat for better consistency.",

I used regular skim milk instead of the condensed milk. Instead of cheddar cheese I used about shredded mozzarella and some cream cheese. (Sorry I don't measure!) And I added more wine.

After baking it was necessary to whisk the sauce a bit to smooth it out but we served it over noodles and there was plenty of the cheesey wine-y garlicky mix to suite everyone's preferences.

I think and this is personal preference I will NEVER like Cream of Mushroom/Chicken soup as a base so this was my own fault for trying to take the easy way out. Otherwise easy to prepare cooking times spot-on.",
