I do prefer smaller meatballs in my Italian Wedding Soup, so I ended up with about 50 meatballs. Not sure what size was intended?  I used the  \"My Italian Turkey Meatballs\" recipe from this site.  The only change I made was to use regular broth (as opposed to low sodium) and it tasted perfect. The cook times were spot on.  This makes 4 HUGE servings. You could easily get 6. Looking forward to leftovers!",

I used 1 LB ground turkey to make Italian meatballs (yielded about 30-35 meatballs). I thought I made them small enough for this soup, but next time, I would make them a little smaller (1/2\" or 3/4\").  I thought it might be lacking in salt by using no sodium broth, but I was wrong. The soup is full of flavor and so comforting on a cold day! I need to have Gluten Free and didn't have any GF Pastina, Acini di Pepe, or even Ditalini on hand, which I'll have to order online for the future. In a pinch, I used a small shell pasta, which worked out OK, but ya know...that's not the right pasta. :-)  I look forward to making this recipe many more times in the future with the correct pasta. I think I'll go make some meatballs to have on hand at all times just for this soup! Thanks for the recipe.",
