The texture was fabulous and the ease of preparation was refreshing-no canned soups, processed cheese, etc.  If I make this again, I would definitely add a lot more flavoring agents.  Thanks for a no fuss--no massively processed food ingredient casserole!  Though their favorite cauliflower recipe is Roasted Garlic Cauliflower from this site...my eaters enjoyed it too, so it's in the keeper box.\n\nEdit:  made it again for a better picture and it never set.  Literally the custard set in top but the bottom was a runny mess.  Used purple cauliflower as that is what we had.  Added dried shallots and roasted garlic powder for flavor.",
