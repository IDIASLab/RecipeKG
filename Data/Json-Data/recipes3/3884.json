But...back then canned vegetables were most commonly used so the creamed peas were made with canned peas. Hubs and I agree canned were and still are infinitely better than frozen and while this recipe takes frozen peas a step in the right direction they're still frozen peas. That said this is a good recipe and I particularly liked the subtle hint of nutmeg (I used fresh grated). Cooking the peas for five minutes is not necessary and might even shrivel them up - just heating them up is fine. In fact they were a little too creamy and just throwing in an extra handful of frozen peas took care of that - no cooking necessary! I'd consider giving this another try - with canned peas.",

I did not cook the peas for a full five minutes as I did not want them overcooked. I just cooked them until tender and set them aside. I also wanted to retain their bright green color.  I thought they were tasty but a little too creamy for me. I would cut back on the amount of light cream next time. The nutmeg was a nice subtle addition and this dish was tasty overall.
