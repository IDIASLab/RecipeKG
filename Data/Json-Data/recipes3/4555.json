I blanched the squash to make it easier to peel and really could have made the slices at least 1/4\" thick to keep them from overcooking. Used seasoned salt doubled the other spices added some marojam and poultry seasoning. Then used the chop drippings for half the butter and browned the onion before adding the flour spices and broth. This was a major hit. Next time I will double the squash and cut thicker but it was still so good.",

Earlier reviewers tipped me to cutting the squash thicker which I did and it was cooked through completely. I also added a beet since I had it on hand and that made that half pink but it was good. Solid comfort food. Could be spiced up a LOT for more interest but if you're looking for something warm and filling and non-challenging this will do the trick.",
