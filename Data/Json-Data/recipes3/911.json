I put a little olive oil in the pan add some garlic fry it a little add the chicken and mushrooms spice it up with salt pepper basil leaves and some Emeril's Italian Essence and heat it through. Then I add the sauce and simmer. I use angel hair pasta only half a pound and after I add the pasta to the boiling water I blanch a cup or two of fresh broccoli for just a minute and add it to the pan with the sauce. That's it! My family loves it and it only takes about 15 or 20 minutes. Very tasty!",
