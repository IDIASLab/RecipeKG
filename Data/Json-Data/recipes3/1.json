I took the advice of many other reviewers added pecans and apples (with skins - but no celery!), added red and green grapes, used less cool whip, used low fat cool whip, strained the canned fruit overnight, added a large box of pistachio instant pudding to the whipped topping and substituted sour cream for the milk - made it very thick and creamy, not runny at all, and the colors of the fruit looked great - together it was a perfect combination!  I tossed it lightly with my hands and it was so simple.  You can't go wrong with this recipe - add any fresh fruit you want!",

But this turned out sickly sweet and not at all what I was looking for. Needed much more fruit and the combination of the marshmallows with so much whipped topping put it over the edge for sweetness. Next time I'll try the one that uses sour cream. I think that's closer to the dish I remember.",

The first time I made it with strawberry Cool Whip and used two cans of mandarin oranges.  It was really good (a little too much coconut though).  The second time I made it I used regular Cool Whip but added a box of instant pistachio pudding to the Cool Whip and then added the rest of the stuff, still using two cans of mandarin oranges.  I only used about 1 1/4 cups of coconut this time.  Everyone raved about this recipe with the pistachio pudding in it.  I will definitely make it this way from now on.  Thanks for the recipe Didi!!! :-)",
