The problem I had was that the vegetables were pretty soggy once they had sat to cool for a while. I would recommend that you make sure the peppers are dry before stuffing them with the eggplant mix.... I think it may also be good to try this with raw peppers. I might do that sometime:).",

It was easy enough to roast both the peppers and eggplant and even to peel them but that is where it stopped being easy. It was hard to I get the seeds out of the pepper keeping it intact and then it wasn't rigid enough to stand to be stuffed. The next time I will cut the peppers in half lengthwise and seed before roasting and use more smaller eggplants with fewer seeds and just pile the filling in the pepper halves. But I will make them again - thanks Asli!",
