I would echo the other reviews in reccommending the use of low sodium soup. I used milk in place of the wine and added more thant 1/4 cup to adjust the \"sauciness\" to my taste. I garlic powdered and peppered my chicken while cooking it for additional flavor. Next time I'm going to saute some mushrooms with the chicken. Overall very tasty! Even better it was quick easy and family friendly. A new staple in my monthly menu. Thanks!",

I think this makes a huge difference in flavor transforming it from the normal \"cream of chicken soup\" taste to WOW(the wine also plays a part in that)! I also made a few other changes suggested such as breading the chicken pieces in Italian bread crumbs before browning (and seasoning it) adding milk to thin the sauce out and make it go farther and I also added 3 different cheeses to use up some extras I had in the fridge (Swiss mozzarella and fresh parmesan). It was an excellent recipe and very filling!",
