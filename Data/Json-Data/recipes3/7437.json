This recipe is delicious however I added 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper 1 tsp garlic powder and too sweeten it a little 1.5 tsp truvia (stevia sweetener). It was a dead ringer for the original. Delish and I making my second batch now!",

Additionally, I had to figure out on my own what temperature and for how long to roast the peppers in the oven. I went for about 400 at about 30-45 minutes. Overall, I think I'll keep this recipe in my arsenal. Thanks!",

But I use a little bit more red wine vinegar (like 1 cup instead of 3/4 cup) and add some sugar (like 1Ts) to balance the acid. I will also put some minced garlic and oregano to make the taste stronger. Sarah thank you for your recipe! Me and my family like it!",
