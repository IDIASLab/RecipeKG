I think the pesto adds a wonderful savory dimension so unless you dislike pesto be sure to add a dollop to the top before you serve and then stir it in. I made only some minor additions to the recipe and that was about a 1/4 tsp. of dried thyme and a Tbsp. of good quality margarine(watching calories). The latter contributed richness to the soup without alot of added fat. I'm going to try this again and make it with roasted chicken although it's very good as is. Husband liked it too.",
