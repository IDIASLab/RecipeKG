                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe if you are familiar with southern cornbread but never cooked it and want to try with a basic recipe.  If you are new to making it, some things you DEFINITELY need to know: 1)\"Dry Corn Bread Mix\" is \"corn meal mix\" with the baking powder and flour already in it, and not Jiffy or sweet brands. The Aunt Jemima, Martha White or White Lily brands are perfect. Sweet dressing doesn't have the traditional southern taste. 2)Sage is delicious but it is VERY strong. If you are not used to sage, cut the recipe amount in half and add your sage to the recipe before the eggs, so you can taste as you go along. 3)The more you stir and mix this recipe, the more dense and gummier it gets. If its \"wet\" before you bake it, the stiffer it will be when it's done. It will sit up like a brick! If you like a lighter, fluffier dressing (\"stuffing\" like), only add as much liquid as needed to be visibly moist like thick stew; it should still be chunky when you pour it in the baking dish to get a light consistency. 4)For non-vegetarians, add meat to this dish! Almost any meat will go well: cubed or shredded turkey, ham, chicken, sausage, ground beef, bacon. Try your favorite. 5)BE CAREFUL if you use poultry seasoning, some blends have salt. Reduce the recipe salt if needed. 6) My grandma told me her secret to good dressing is the vegetables, so use plenty celery & onion. Cook them only until tender and the onions are translucent so you don't lose all the crunch. It adds great t",

Wow, what a hit with my crowd! I found it easy to bake it for 30 minutes the night before, refrigerate, let it come to room temperature, then bake it 10-15 minutes before serving is perfect.

If you can't find a sugar-free mix, buy a bag of cornmeal and follow the instructions to bake your own cornbread from scratch.  The dressing won't taste right otherwise.  My grandmother used a similar recipe, but added 2 or 3 chopped hard-boiled eggs to the dressing mixture before baking.  The amount of sage you need depends on personal taste and how long ago the jar of sage was bought and opened.  Add sage by single teaspoons (BEFORE you put in the raw, beaten eggs), stir well, and taste test after each teaspoon.  This will ensure you get a perfect pan of dressing!",

I decided to strike out on my own and give it a try. I have a couple of tips to add. I increased the chicken stock by about a 1/4 cup and be sure you use a glass or light colored baking dish. The dark baking pan will dry this out. Also, I broke the rules and used Jiffy (with sugar) for my cornbread. I have to say, I like the added sweetness. It isn't as sweet as most other brands so it still came out pretty good. It's not the same as Mamaw's, but I don't have left overs either.",
