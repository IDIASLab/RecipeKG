I also don't keep margerine in my house so I used melted butter. I didn't fold the chocolate chips into the batter I sprinkled them on top of each portion of pancake batter after I ladled it on the griddle. My kids (and I'll tell you so did my husband!) loved these pancakes. They didn't need much embelishment I just added a little butter and honey over the top. HUGE hit. Next time I'd like to try these with a little ground cinnamon and nutmeg and use Hershey's cinnamon chips. I'll cut back on the baking powder next time as well. NOTE: If I was making them for a breakfast where I was eating I'd make them even lighter by using applesauce in place of half or even most of the butter and eggs and I'd use two egg whites in place of one of the eggs.",

There's something so as Homer Simpson would say \"groin-grabbingly transcendent\" about melty chocolate chip explosions in the center of a pancake and these were good but I think the author of the recipe perhaps meant 2 TSP of b. powder not TB?",

I wanted to try this recipe to test some white whole wheat flour I bought. I didn't have wheat germ so I subbed it with an equal amount of quick oats to keep the balance of wet to dry ingredients. For the milk I used 2% and for the demera sugar I used regular. It wasn't much anyway. I realized I had only a little over half the amount of chocolate chips suggested and it worked fine. I did use the mini type though. The only downside is I don't normally cook with pan spray and found it burns quickly even on medium. So I did have to rinse the pan after every pancake or 2. Either way it made a good and filling breakfast. ty",
