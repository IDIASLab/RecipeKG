I added additional spices to suit my family's tastes by adding cumin chili powder and garlic as well as a few dashes of hot sauce but it came out excellent and was a hit in our home. Thank you for sharing the recipe. Also a tip that I've learned for baking meatloaf is to line the bottom your baking dish with slices of bread before setting the meat in. Then any fat that drains out during cooking is soaked up by the bread. When you dish the meatloaf out onto a serving plate just discard the bread and you're good to go.",
