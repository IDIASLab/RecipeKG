I used half regular onion cause I ran out of green so I cooked them a bit in the butter to soften them up. I also used Smart Balance spread but would like to try the unsalted butter (didn't have any unsalted on hand). I used sherry but only 1 cup as it seemed moist enough. (If I needed more I think I'd fill in with chicken broth cause it had just a subtle sherry flavor and more would be too much.) I cooked it in the oven for an hour with a lid and it didn't need any longer than that but I did remove the lid and cook a hair longer to crispy the top a bit. The only bad thing is I hate ripping up bread - might try getting the plain bagged croutons and see if more liquid and cooking with the lid softens them up cause I love the flavor. And I didn't make it for any holiday - don't feel like I need one to be allowed to eat something.:-) So it was just a chicken meal. (I do consider this is more like 8 servings or 12 at most. It's only 24 if everyone gets only a big spoonful.)",

Every Thanksgiving I like to try out a different dressing recipe hoping to stumble upon \"the\" best dressing. This will definitely go in the running that's for sure. The only thing though is that I did use the 2 cups of sherry as stated in the recipe but thought it was way too strong. Next time I will take the suggestions of other reviewers and use half sherry and half chicken broth. I also sauteed in butter and added to mixture green onions celery garlic and mushrooms. So for me it was a wonderful basic dressing recipe. Thanks Erika Michael for submitting this.",
