The lime does a good job of getting that fishy smell and taste out of the fish. I would definitely recommend staying with the grouper or any white fish that flakes in big chunks as the grouper did a fantastic job staying together after baking. I did make a few minute adjustments: I did not marinate and the fish came out superb! No real reason I saw the recipe that day and didn't have time to marinate as suggested. I skipped the bell peppers didn't have any on hand. I didn't use red pepper flakes afraid it'd be too spicy for the kids instead I used a regular fish seasoning I've had for forever with a touch of salt. As far as the time 25 minutes was all I needed! The fish was moist flavorful and easy! Love this fish!",
