Although the taste was good there were some modifications that needed to be made because they turned out too dry. Instead of using 5 (5 oz.) cans of noodles use only 3. This will hold everything together without them falling apart. Also scoop out about a heaping tablespoon worth drop on the parchment paper & then flatten out with the back of the spoon. People found it a bit difficult to get their mouth around the mound so I flattened them. After that they were delicious.",
