I created this recipe with simple ingredients that are already found in the kitchen. It's delicious by itself, but feel free to experiment and even make your own artichoke salad. It's not like the real deal...it's better! Enjoy immediately or chill the marinated artichokes for at least an hour before serving.",

I was a bit leary of the Italian seasoning, but it really gives them good flavor. I did use the optional garlic, which is a must, IMO. Be sure to use a good extra virgin olive oil. I've been eating them straight out of the fridge, but plan to make a salad w/ them for dinner, if they last that long, lol. These would also be great on an anti-pasto platter, which is what I will do w/ them next time. I think a great twist would be to add maybe 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of crushed pepper flakes in there as well...believe me, they are wonderful as is, just thinking out loud, lol. Note that these do not taste like the jarred ones @ the store...they are different, but better! This is a definite keeper that I will make often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I used 4 cans of quartered artichokes 1 1/2 lemons 4 tblspns of olive oil salt and pepper 2 tspns of Italian seasonig and 4 cloves of crushed garlic. They looked so good in the jar just like the ones in the store. I will update my review as soon as I get the \"taste\" feedback I need. Thanks for a great recipe. 5/18/12- got my first \"taste\" review back from my mom who raved about these artichokes. She tried them last night and said they were perfectly seasoned and tangy. At this point the artichokes have been sitting and marinating for a lil over 2 weeks. I think as they sit the will increase in flavor.",

One other point I didn't care for was that there is just barely enough liquid to coat the artichoke hearts.
