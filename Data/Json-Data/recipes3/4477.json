First of all, I used fresh corn, cooked and cut off the cob.  I used frozen peas instead of canned because....Yuck!  Canned peas are icky. I used grape tomatoes, cut in half instead of large tomatoes to cut down on the liquid, and seeded the cucumber for the same reason.  I also made a vinaigrette instead of mayonnaise.  My husband said he didn't think he would like a corn salad, but he really liked this one.  Although I made several changes, I thank you for the recipe!",

For this reason I'd suggest making the servings small like in a lettuce cup. Not exactly rave reviews but everyone liked it fine and it's pretty filling. I make it for myself on occasion but I only use frozen corn and peas then microwave them to just thaw out never cook them. They are a lot sweeter that way. I also used fresh red bell pepper and no cucumbers (my husband is allergic). This is an easy recipe to change to suit your tastes. The point is to keep it simple. Thanks Kim for this great idea!",
