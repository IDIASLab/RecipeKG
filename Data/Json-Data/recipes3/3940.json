Don't let the seemingly common ingredients fool you - this is incredible on any salad (let's put it this way - I've had salad twice a day since I made this, including a breakfast salad!!).  It's exactly the way I think dressing should be - so tangy, packed with flavor and EASY.  I love that I can store it out in my countertop with my olive oil and vinegars (I put it in an empty balsamic vinegar bottle - very cute!). **For an extra-tasty Greek salad, put the desired amount of dressing in a small bowl, and add at least 1/2 the amount of feta you plan to use.  Stir gently, then let it sit 15 minutes or more before adding to the traditional salad ingredients. Very yummy!\n**ADDED LATER**\nMade as directed, this dressing will separate very quickly and very thoroughly! Here's how to lessen that: You will have to scale back quite a bit - play with the recipe scaler until the oil and the vinegar together equal an amount that will fit in your blender and still leave mixing room. Then, put everything BUT the oil and the herbs in the blender and start 'er up - medium high should do it. Very slowly drizzle in the olive oil until it is all incorporated. Woohoo! You just emulsified! Stop the blender, add in the herbs, pulse once or twice. Just mix in the herbs, don't chop them - it's prettier. Problem solved!",
