As someone who does not like turkey, the rich, creamy mornay sauce made it delightfully palatable.  The sauce was perfectly smooth and silky and tasted like an elegant white country gravy.   Pecorino cheese makes all of the difference in the world.  It\u2019s pricey, but well worth the indulgence. I believe I added at least 1/4tsp. or more of black pepper,  about 1/8tsp. nutmeg(I love nutmeg), and skipped the cayenne pepper.  I used up some leftover turkey, so I didn\u2019t make that part of the recipe.  A thick Texas style toast is a must--buttered and grilled in a skillet until golden brown.   Then assembled as directed.  So good!  Did I mention it\u2019s rich?  Mmmm!",

I've never been to Louisville to have the original so I have nothing to compare against but the final result was really really good! That tomato is just PERFECT in there. I have a lot of turkey and sauce left over so I'm going to try a few modifications tomorrow. I think I'll try using toasted rye or pumpernickle bread and slice the turkey a bit thinner and add a few thin slices of ham. Can't wait. I highly recommend this recipe.",
