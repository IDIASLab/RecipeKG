I tossed the pasta and chicken w/tomato and fresh baby spinach and used Good Season Greek dressing to mix w/the red wine vinegar and parmesan cheese. I also tossed the complete mixture w/a handful of shredded italian blend cheese. This was great! I'm looking forward to trying it Ceasar style soon. Thanks for a great weeknight staple!",

I didn't even get a bite! This recipe makes a VERY generous amount also! He claims to some extent that the salad is better than having intercourse which is pretty amazing! The salad tastes better when it's chilled giving time for the cooked chicken to chill also. For those people who don't know what to add to what I just dump the lettuce paste chicken and dressing in all together and mix the entire thing. This has definately become \"the salad to make\" at my house. It's a hit with other family members also!",
