I needed to add a 1/4 cup of water to the initial mixture as it was going to stick. Cooked down quickly and I added our left over already cooked rotini. This was an excellent meal that we will make again.",

This is a super-hearty sauce so instead of serving it over pasta we eat it over brown rice. I made it with pasta once and felt like I could barely move afterward!",
