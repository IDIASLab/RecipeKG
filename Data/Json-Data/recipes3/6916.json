I incorporated some of the fresh herbs from my friend's garden and came up with this recipe as a way to use up leftover turkey. Serve the salad on croissants, crusty rolls, or a bed of lettuce.

I also added some chopped apples to give it a little more sweetness. For the dressing I used Hellman's light mayo and cut it with a bit of reduced fat sour cream. I also opted to use a little curry powder vs. rosemary and parsley. I'm a huge fan of rosemary but for this salad I felt the curry powder just paired better. I let this set in the fridge for a few hours and after sneaking a few bites - WOW what a wonderful combination of flavors! This was so good on whole grain bread - thanks for a great recipe.",
