                "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this simple vinaigrette and followed the recipe to a \"T\" which is rare for me.  I had all the ingredients on hand, so it was quick and easy.  It's very light and doesn't have the usual vinegary tang... I love it both ways, but this was a refreshing change of pace.  It calls for a LOT of parsley, but I think that is what keeps it tasting lemony and light even with the sharper flavors of lime and capers... so don't be afraid of the parsley!\nI can see how it would taste wonderful with seafood as Tatiana suggested in her description.  I served it with a spinach and romaine salad, threw in some red onion, peeled/seeded/diced cucumber, both fresh and roasted red peppers, and a little parm.  Very fresh and light which complemented my other ingredients.\nFor serving purposes, FYI... I used about 2/3 of a \"bunch\" of spinach and the same amount of a \"head\" of romaine along with the veggies listed above, and there was plenty of dressing.  I find that most salads taste best when they aren't drowning in dressing but gently tossed with a modest amount, and this is no exception.  This recipe actually yields enough for about 6 servings.",
