If you're tired sweet cornbread or just want something different for a change try this one.",

Also in the Balkans cornbread is eaten with feta cheese usually; it's even included in the batter sometimes but that is a bit of a different recipe. Also sour cream and feta is very nice with this as would be any strong flavored cheese. Try it that way and you will enjoy it more if you feel it is bland.",

It will sizzle and put a nice crispy crust on the bread. This was gobbled up by this southern family.",
