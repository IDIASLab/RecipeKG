As a different and unique dish that captures the \"spirit\" of what ceviche flavor is (spicy, citrusy, juicy)- absolutely! Definitely agree with other reviewers and reccommend that you let this sit and marinade for a bit before digging in- the flavors just intensify and really come together- sooo good!
