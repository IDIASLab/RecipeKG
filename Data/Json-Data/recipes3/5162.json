I agree with other reviewers that the dressing really should be doubled if you plan on chilling it all day, which I did not. Just a couple hours was all I had today. I think if I make this again, I'd double the spices (salt excluded) and I'd add chopped tomatoes. As is, it's a very tasty salad!",

Lots of ingredients, some of which you won\u2019t have on hand. I bought some exclusively for this. Gets pricey too if you don\u2019t have some of the stuff. I did have quite a few things. Very colorful with the meat, cheese and veggies, so don\u2019t substitute or omit and ruin that. Cut the cost a little by using a couple of ounces less of sliced pepperoni, provolone and olives. Instead of chunks, cut pizza size pepperoni slices into quarters and provolone slices first into strips, then cut again into \u00bd inch squares. Only a 2 \u00bc oz. can of sliced olives, drained, is needed. I used only \u00bd a red onion. There was still plenty of everything to distribute thru the salad. Will make again.",

The pasta did absorb the taste better by the next day but it was dry.  I also would add more salt & pepper.  It tasted a little bland.  I added halved cherry tomatoes to mine.  It was very good.
