Instead of pouring maple syrup on at end, just make your own; it's better.  Put your apple slices in the pan, put maybe a tablespoon or so of water, add either white (my preference) or brown sugar to your taste.. I usually cover the apples, sprinkle with cinnamon & a little nutmeg to your taste, and at least 2 tablespoons of butter.  Cover tightly and cook on low heat until cooked down to your liking.  Serve with warm, buttered toast.. my daughters love to put the apples on their toast and take bites of it together.  Love this!",
