Also cooked to 135 degrees to create a more moist roast instead of 160 as recommended (this would cause the roast to be much too dry for my tastes). The reduction was lovely with the pork I admit to being a little skeptical of how the reduction would turn out. Served with the greens (I made this a week after Thanksgiving so I added all my leftover celery and green onion as well) and a hot buttered roll. Simple and DELICIOUS! My husband enjoyed this mean very much. Thank you for the recipe.",

I did make changes though. I didn't tie it I just scored the meat diagonally and stuffed the sage and garlic cloves. I did think that there was too much pepper but that is my own personal choice. I would suggest only a teaspoon maybe a little more. also if you let the fennel and onions carmelize or almost burn after the OJ evaporates IS AMAZING! yet again my own personal taste. 2 thumbs up!",
