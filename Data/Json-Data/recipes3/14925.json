I have xylitol at home and knowing that xylitol is much sweeter than erythritol I used 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. I wish I would have did half instead because it was just a little too sweet. Also the xylitol is a little grainy. I'm not sure if they make powder oh well - not the recipe's fault. I also couldn't find sugar free food coloring so I just skipped it. I will be making these again!",
