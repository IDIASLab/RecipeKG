I\u2019m sure this would have been even better with those additions but quite honestly, I don\u2019t see how!  Other than using fresh herbs rather than dried (the fresh equivalent is 3:1 and I substituted oregano for the marjoram) and forgetting the onion and garlic I followed the recipe as written and it was simple perfection.  Rich, savory, flavorful, neither too thin nor too thick.  We cleaned up every bit of this and Hubs has requested a repeat soon.  The only thing I\u2019ll do differently next time is to be sure to follow the recipe more closely and not forget the onion and the garlic.

It was pretty good the first day, it was even better the second day.  By the third day, it really was heavenly.  It didn't last \r\nlonger than that, as we were each trying to get the last bowl without the other noticing.  I doubled the recipe, which is why it lasted so long.  I tried to follow the recipe as close as possible.  I couldn't find low sodium beef broth, so I used regular.  I also only used half the amount of mushrooms.  I cut the meat slightly smaller than is in most stews, to spread it out a bit more.  I can't say how well it freezes.  That was my intention when I doubled the recipe.  Unfortunately, it was just too good to stop eating.  I'll be making it again this afternoon.  Can't wait!  EDITED TO ADD...it took much longer than the suggested cooking time.  I added in the carrots after cooking the meat and broth for 30 minutes.  I added the remaining ingredients and spices after cooking for the suggested cooking time of 1hour.  Then cooked another 40 or so minutes.",
