My hubby was helping me prepare some of the vegetables and failed to get the onions small enough so that when we tasted the casserole they were still not soft and a bit too crunchy. In the future I may saut\u00e9 the onions to make them softer. I also used 1/3 fat cream cheese and noticed no difference between the regular and the less fat taste. I also ran out of regular yellow squash and threw in some butternut squash. BUT it still tasted yummy. Apparently one yellow squash only makes about one cup of cooked squash. Hope you will enjoy it!

First I was confused on the amount of squash to use. I had about 9 cups uncooked and it cooked down to about 6 1/2. Maybe that was my problem. I also chopped my carrot and onion in a food processor so maybe it was too finely chopped. Beyond this I followed the recipe exactly. It was way too watery so I baked for 15 more minutes. Still mushy and too late to serve with dinner. I didn't think it tasted very good and the stuffing mix on top was too hard and crunchy. I don't know how I could have messed this up so badly but could use some advice. Also would suggest better detail on the recipe particularly on the quantity of squash and how to cook it. I blanched mine. And was I supposed to do something to prepare the stuffing mix prior to sprinkling it on top? I can't imagine that it was supposed to be as hard as little rocks! Sorry to spoil the excellent ratings but this sure didn't work for me!",

Now I do tend to like my foods more creamier. Next time I may use a small egg instead of a large egg. I also cooked the squash to where I could just pierce it with a fork not mushy before adding to the mixture and cooking. I thin I did add extra cream cheese because I love it.
