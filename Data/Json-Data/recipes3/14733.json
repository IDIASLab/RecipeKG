I think the Tony's should be cut back to one tablespoon and that would solve both issues. Other than that, this was perfect. Cooking the rice in broth makes all the difference in the world when it comes to flavor. Thanks for sharing Mandybelcanto!",

I didn't put chicken in mine, but that's just from laziness and not wanting to cook it, and I recommend (if using pre-cooked sausage/shrimp) to use some olive oil when saut\u00e9ing veggies, and I cooked it for 10 minutes with the tomatoes and everything thrown in, then added the already cooked shrimp and sausage in and let it simmer for just a few minutes. Outside of using precooked meat and adding some crushed red pepper, I followed everything and it was so good! Thank you very much for the recipe.",

I don\u2019t care for highly spicy foods, nor do Hubs\u2019 sensitive innards, so I had to work with this a bit to limit the heat factor.  In addition to reducing the amount of Creole seasoning by half, I omitted the ground pepper and hot sauce altogether.  I liked the idea of dicing the sausage, as it spread its own heat more evenly!  The level of spice was perfect for me, but for Hubs it still was a little too much because of the andouille.  So, since andouille seems like kielbasa with a bit of red pepper flakes, those with spicy heat issues like his might want to just use kielbasa instead.  Scaling this to three servings made it impractical to use only portions of cans of both tomato sauce and diced tomatoes, so I simply used an entire can of petite diced tomatoes.  I cooked the chicken in strips (not shredded) with the sausage and didn\u2019t add the shrimp until the last few minutes of cooking.  The finished dish, with the heat level adjustments, was simple perfection.  It has an appealing flavor with its trio of meats and Creole spice.  Creole comfort food!  Hubs, who generally won\u2019t take anything to work for his lunch that he has to eat with a fork, happily took the leftovers  today.  Darn it.",
