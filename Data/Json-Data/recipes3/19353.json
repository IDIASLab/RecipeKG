Sorry Earla.\n\nThat being said, I think I managed to perfect it.  I made it in a half batch with the following measures:\n1-1/2 C Hershey's Cocoa Powder\n3 C Powdered Sugar\n5 C Powdered Milk\n1 C Powdered Creamer (I find Borden's is the best)\n\nTo make some fab modifications that will really knock their socks off, try adding 2 tsp ground cinnamon to the mix for Mexican Hot Chocolate.\n\nOr for a more festive variety, reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup, then powder 12 candy canes in the blender and add into the mix for a nice Candy Cane Cocoa!  My husband loves this one so much, I can't seem to get any out for gifts!",

For a batch for the kids I added about a cup and a half more powdered sugar, and on another batch I added cinnamon sticks inside the containers I sent.  I have never had so many raves...this is a keeper, and one to definetly experiment with!!  :)\n\n*Extra added Note*  I just made a new batch omitting one cup of the milk for 2 small containers of cinnamon creamer, and using 1 cup of nestles quick along with the cocoa (ok, so christmas is depleting my pantry a bit!) :) But it was so incredibly good that I decided to keep the whole batch for our family and go to the store to make a new one!!  One Last note, added in 2009, while making the cocoa last year, I found that making it all in a big kitchen trash bag made this SO much easier to mix...really, try it, you'll love it!!",

                "reviewBody": "I made 2 seperate batches of this mix with 2 different types of cocoa and they both came out very different. Surprisingly, Hershey's cocoa yielded a richer, more chocolatey cocoa (which in turn required more sugar) than the more expensive cocoa. This could be a reason why different people had different results. I rated this 4 stars because of the adjustments I made (increased cocoa to 2 cups, and sugar to 6. Added 1 tsp salt. I also used nonfat dry milk so I increased the cremora by 1/2 cup for a richer taste.) I also followed the suggestion of sifting my ingredients and grinding the dry milk to fine powder. Thta helped reduce the \"mud\" in the bottom of your cup and made for a creamier texture. In my opinion this compares to the mixes you buy from the store but I like the control over what you put in it. I made one batch with hazelnut creamer and that came out really good - tasted like the Landolakes version. Thanks for a versatile recipe! **new note added 12/3** I made a mocha flavored batch by adding 10 TBS instant coffe ground up, extra cup of sugar and cremora each and 1/2 tsp dried vanilla powder and it was a big hit!",

I use 10 cups milk powder 6 cups powdered sugar 2 cups cocoa powder 1 3/4 cups \"Royale\" Cremora 2 envelopes of Stephens sipping cocoa mix and 1 bag of mini-marshmallows. It makes 8 pint jars. Because of the marshmallows you need to \"tap\" the jar to take out air pockets. I make a nice variation using 2 1/2 tsp. of Cinnamon with an extra 1/2 cup powdered sugar. I call it \"Gourmet Christmas Cocoa\". I decorate the top with fabric and raffia add a cute tag and sell these jars at Craft Fairs for 4.50 each. Actual cost works out to about 1.80 per jar but the jar itself is the most expensive. I use Penzeys Vietnamese Cinnamon and Penzeys Dutch Process Cocoa Powder. Thanks for a fabulous base recipe! I may try regular granulated sugar as most powdered sugars have cornstarch in them. Have a look at the confectioners sugar box next time you see one in the store. Thanks again...this is wonderful!:0)",

You really do need a BIG bowl to mix this all up in...I first tried to mix it between 2 large bowls but that didn't work so well because I thought I was done and then realized I still had to add all the Sugar! So what I did was use our large Stockpot and mix everything in there.  That worked Great!   \r\nA quick note on the Milk.  I purchased a box of the powdered milk that said it had TEN One Quart Envelopes in it.  I was thinking I would have plenty of powder.  What it actually means is that each envelope MAKES a Quart and each package actually had one cup of powered milk.  I was very lucky and had the exact amount needed.      ***Also as far as packaging this up,  what I did was buy some mugs from the dollar store, put enough for 2 cups in small bags (like another person already suggested) and then tied a candy cand and a nib of peppermint schnapps to it.  These make Great inexpensive gifts!\r\n\r\n",
