When I saw \"Maui Chicken\" I looked over the ingredients and thought that perhaps shrimp and scallops would be a better fit than chicken. So I left out the chicken and added 1/2lb scallops and a total of 16 medium shrimp. Everything else I followed. I thought the sauce was to thin so I added some cornstarch to thicken it up - I served this over rice. I think adding the shrimp and scallops made it more \"Island fare\" than chicken would have. It is a great starter recipe.",
