I didn't have canned beets so shredded peeled fresh beets with a coarse blade covered with cold water brought to a boil drained dumped in ice water drained again. Used chopped chestnut and canned wax beans-because that's what was on hand. Cannot improve on the dressing and I will no doubt use it on other salads as well. Might try blanching the broccoli next time as well. This would be a beautiful and very different addition to a Potlatch.",
