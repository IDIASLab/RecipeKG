Perhaps they were too ripe or I used the wrong type of pan-I used a nonstick skillet but they just got mushy and a lot of juice was released. I had to strain the juice out there was so much. Anyway I was thinking this would be like apple fritters then noticed there is no sugar listed in the recipe so I added some and some cinnamon. When they came out of the fryer I drained them on paper towels then sprinkled them with sugar. They were really kinda boring. I thought the kids would love them since I don't normally fry stuff for them but they each ate one and that was that. I had many left over-not a good sign in my house for a repeat. We won't try this one again.",
