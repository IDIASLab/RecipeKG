I sauteed the chicken with salt, pepper and added 3 cloves of garlic before adding baking. This step keeps the juices in the chicken which prevents the sauce from becoming watery, as this was a complaint of many others.  I also increased the sour cream by 1/4 cup and flavors melded together. I have also considered adding sauteed creminis for more texture in the sauce.  ",

I agree with other reviewers that the swiss/sherry combination is very nice.  It tastes more sophisticated than your typical cream of mushroom recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly. Cooking time was perfect.  The chicken was moist and tender.  Hubby and I both really liked this.  Prep was nice and easy too.  Next time, I may try bread crumbs in place of croutons. ",

Heavily sprinkle SEASONED PEPPER on breasts---salt----2 slices per breast----MIX TOGETHER: 1 can of the mushroom soup--one soup can of sherry--1 Cup sour cream--2 chopped garlic cloves and POUR OVER CHICKEN. Crush 1 1/2 cups of Texas Toast croutons to smaller bits (but not fine) and add 1/2 Cup Panko Italian crumbs. Add 1 teaspoon dry dill (I didn't have fresh) to the 1/2 cup melted butter then toss in crumbs. BAKE CHICKEN FOR 20 MINUTES-THEN ADD CRUMBS ON TOP. BAKE ANOTHER 20. The flavor reminded me of San Remo Dip Olive Garden used to have. I would even venture to add CHOPPED PIMENTO!",
