No one raved, but it was certainly serviceable.  THANKS for the recipe!",

I was on a roll putting everything into the blender for this and I added the salt...that was a mistake, b/c the feta is salty enough on it's own that I don't think any additional salt is needed. So, aside from it being salty (my own fault for not paying attention), this was very tasty. This would also be great for a veggie dip! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I agree with lovestohost though, it is too fatty as written it needs an acid, I added 4 squirts of lemon juice to 1/2 the recipe and it was good for our taste. I used fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder and only a pinch of salt since feta is salty, I also added a sprinkle of Greek seasoning.\n#AllrecipesAllstarsCanada\n#ForThoseYouLove",
