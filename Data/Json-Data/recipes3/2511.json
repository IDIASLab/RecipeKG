I found that there was not enough sauce, so I will double it next time.  10 minutes is too long cooking the tomatoes; they fall apart.  I also cut the chicken into strips and put it over pasta.  I think adding feta and artichokes would be a nice addition.  I added crushed red pepper for a little spice the first time, but will try the feta and artichoke next time and see what happens.  I do have to say this though, it does make a nice aroma.  My husband told me as he was walking up to our apartment he was thinking, 'I hope this is coming from my apartment'.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  This recipe has grown on me.  I give it 5 stars with the following changes.  1. Double the sauce  2. Use diced canned tomatoes with juice  3. Use boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut in cubes.  Enjoy!",

We only used dried oregano & basil instead of fresh, b/c both herbs go bad so much more quickly than I can use them.  2) re: kid-friendly: my three year old ate the chicken, but resisted the new flavor of the olives.  But we don't feed him mac & cheese or hot dogs, so maybe his tastes won't translate to all American children.  Someone raised the wine question; alcohol cooks off in recipes.  There's no reason not to expand aa child's tastes with this great recipe!  3)My husband, who adores everything throat-burning hot, tried the suggested red pepper flakes sprinkled on top after tasting the authentic recipe & definitely prefered it as written.  4)Next time, we'll cut the Kalamata olives up into almost a tapenade, b/c the olive MADE this recipe & should be tasted in every bite.  5) We served the meal over a bed of basmati rice--good for soaking up all the delicate sauce.  Next time--vermicelli.",
