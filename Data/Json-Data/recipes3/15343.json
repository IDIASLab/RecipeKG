This was so easy, so quick, so rich and delicious. Shiny and glossy, very easy to work with, and sets up nicely. I kept the glaze in a double boiler and kept it warm as I glazed my little cakes--just dipped each cake--and had them glazed in a New York minute! I am so impressed with this glaze that not only will it become one of my favorite recipes, but I'm also going to tinker with it to make a white chocolate version as well (may have to adjust the butter for it, but I'll figure it out!) I believe that sooner or later this simple and beautiful glaze will \"catch on\" and it will become one of the favorites on this site! ",

With the water heating in a regular saucepan, put two thick glass tumblers into the water.  These become your double boiler!  Put 1/2 the butter and chocolate into each glass slowly and stir with a butter knife or a spoon until everything has melted.  I would suggest at least with this method to put the butter in first because it's harder to get it to melt if you melt the chocolate first.  And experiment with different types of chocolate!  I used 4 oz Nestle semi-sweet baking chocolate, 3 oz Ghirardelli 70% dark and 3oz Ghirardelli 100% cocoa and it came out delicious!  I'd like to see how a few oz of mint chocolate would come out, too.  :-)  Good recipe!  Will use again!!",

I used 2 1/2 4oz Ghirardelli baking bars.(Each 4 oz. Bar Contains 8 sections(1/2 oz. each). 2 sections equal 1 oz. I have to admit I am horrible with math so I was confussed with the measurements for the chocolate. I used regular butter b/c I didn't have unsalted. As soon as I poored the glaze on my bundt cake it started to stiffen and has a wonderful shine to it. Not to mention it tastes great. I love it and will use this from now on.
