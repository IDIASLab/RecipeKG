The one I know You add the coconut to the milk with a box of powdered sugar and the vanilla mikx together well. Chill until firm. Use small cookie dough scoop and scoop out balls. If you need to roll in hands to shape a little better. Place on cookie sheet and place in fridge to firm back up. Melt semi sweet or milk chocolate chips in bowl in microwave. Dip coconut balls in chocolate place back on cookie sheet and imediataely place a ROASTED almond on top and slightly press down. Let coating harden either at room temp or speed up by placing in fridge. Now these will taste more like the popular candy!",
