I'm perplexed as to why some reviewers thought there was too much mayo.  I hate too much salad dressing (always order it on the side!), but this only had a light coating.  I'm wondering whether those people didn't use enough pasta. It calls for 2 cups of DRY pasta, which is actually an entire box, I believe (the box I used had 16 oz dry rotelle).  Anyway, it's the best pasta salad I've ever had!",

I used bow-tie pasta and added in blanched broccoli florets, seedless cucumbers, red, yellow, and green peppers as well as fresh Roma tomatoes. For the dressing, I used 1 cup of mayonnaise but added in about 3/4-1 cup of prepared zesty Italian dressing, along with the suggested ingredients. I too was afraid of the large amount of mayonnaise. Regardless, everything tasted great and it got better each day it was left-over. I would make it again because it was pretty looking.",

Pasta salads are so easy and no matter what you add to them as long as the veggies are fresh you use a good quality dressing and it's chilled - it'll be wonderful. So add what you like. This recipe is a great base. I used a whole bunch of cherry tomatoes that I cut in half and added some red and green pepper along with the rest of the ingredients. For the \"dressing\" I added a little dried Italian seasoning. I also topped it with some shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses - delicious!",
