And added a medium potato finely chopped and about a 1/4 of a small sweet onion to the celery mixture!   I was really careful not to let this come to a boil as cream could curdle.   This was a more expensive dinner than I usually make but when a girl wants oysters, then a girl gets oysters.  also bought a $4 bouquet of flowers!  It was a day to smile about!  :)",
