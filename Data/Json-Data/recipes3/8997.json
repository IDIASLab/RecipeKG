Instead of adding the seasonings to the final breading, I mixed the seasonings together in a little dish and tossed it with the raw shrimp before I started breading them. That way non of the dried herbs get \"burned\" by the frying process. The seasonings are hydrated by the moist shrimp and protected by the coating. The seasonings cook from the inside instead of getting fried from the outside which results in richer flavor.",
