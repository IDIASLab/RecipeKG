One thing I want to add, for people who are new to making dump;ings (most recipes for dumplings aren't newbie-friendly) is make sure your dumpling mixture is a wet-sticky dough.  If you make the dough too dry and pliable, your dumplings will come out too chewey,  A sticly-wet dough will make a soft, fluffy and delicious dumpling.  Unforunately I learned this through experimentation and not the recipe!",

However, I have had a few bites of it - practicing the \"reverse blow\" method - and let me tell you...it is good.  I modified the recipe only VERY slightly.  I substituded \"cream of chicken AND mushroom\" (Cambells - at Publix) for plain cream of chicken.  I didn't measure onions or celery - used 1 whole (medium) onion, and 2 1/2 stalks of celery.  I added approximately 1/3 package of sliced baby portobello mushrooms.  Can we tell I like 'shrooms?  I must admit, I did peek once after adding the dumplings, but I was afraid that if I didn't stir it at least once, something would burn.  I would suggest, you prepare the rounded dumplings while allowing the simmering process to take place.  After letting the dumplings cook, I did add a combination of 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of cornstarch + ~1/2 cup of extremely cold water = a thicker base.  Total cooking time, an hour and a half.  Then again - I was drinking bottles of Budweiser during the wait - so I didn't mind too much.  I fully intend on keeping this recipe around for a while.",

Instead of using chicken broth (it's so expensive in the store for just a small can) I cooked my chicken by boiling it in salted water with 4 chicken bouillon cubes. In addition to celery seed I added a pinch of sage (or about 1/4 tsp.) a pinch of garlic powder a dash (or about 1 tsp.) of basil a dash of thyme. I would omit the onion the next time. It ended up stuck to the bottom of the stew when I steamed the dumplings. In my opinion it doesn't need them. This makes a wonderful chicken stew. It's thicker than my mom used to make but frankly it's better that way! The dumplings are just like Mom made too.",

In the end the dumplings are what make or break this recipe. I made a double recipe to feed 8 so I used a Dutch oven. Also I seared the chicken and veggies first in the Dutch oven so none of the flavor was lost removed them made the soup and added the veggies and chicken back at the point the recipe says to do it. I added sliced mushrooms to the onion and celery mix. I also added thawed frozen peas just before dropping the dumplings in. With a single recipe a large sauce pan would be fine but doubling the recipe I was glad to have the surface area of the Dutch oven for the dumplings. Finally after reading reviews I went low sodium with every ingredient and the result was not too salty at all. On a comfort food scale of 1-10 this was an 11.",

                "reviewBody": "Scrumptous! This made an excellent dinner that needed no side dishes! You have your meat vegies and bread all in one stew-like dish. This was the first time I made dumplings and it went quite well. I could have cooked them a tad longer but it was still very good. The changes I made were very minimal. Used Olive oil instead of vegie oil to cook the chicken onions and celery added rosemary to the dumplings and did not sift the flour. The next time I make this (and trust me there will be a next time!) I will double the recipe for the broth mixture (cream of chicken chicken broth and milk) because it could of used more of that and I will season the chicken breast's. I'm not quite sure with what yet but chicken is such a bland meat. It was very moist and tender in this dish though! This was also my husbands first time having chicken and dumplings (weird!) and he liked it. THe only complaint from him was also that it could've used more of the broth mixture. But anyway FABULOUS!",

                "reviewBody": "UPDATE! My orignal review was a five but I just made it again and realized the first time I'd forgotten to add the spices before dropping the dumplings. I wished I'd done it again this time 'cause there is WAY TOO MUCH CELERY SEED. It is completely overpowering. Don't add it at all or add only 1/4 tsp or so. Here is my review the first time around when I didn't add the celery seed: This is a really delicious easy recipe. I doubled the sauce mixture (to 2 cans of soup 29 oz of broth and 1 c. of milk) as did want more veggies in this dish and needed more liquid. So I cubed potatoes and carrots (about 1.5 cups each) boiled them for 10 minutes and then added them to the chicken soup mixture with a cup of peas (canned) just before dropping the dumplings. I also added black pepper and parsley to the dry ingredients of the dumplings for color and taste.",
