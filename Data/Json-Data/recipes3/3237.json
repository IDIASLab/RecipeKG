When I made this dressing I added the white wine vinegar a little at a time tasting after each tablespoon--two tablespoons was just enough for me. I ended up thinning it out a bit with reduced fat milk. I really loved the combination of ingredients in this dressing. This was nice drizzled over wedge salad. I'd like to make this again but maybe add some fresh chives and maybe a little onion powder.",

Also beware the amount of black pepper used--1 tbsp or less should do the trick if you don't like it too hot. Great recipe otherwise though!",

I cut the vinegar back to 3 tbsp. which was plenty. I upped the fresh black pepper a bit based on personal taste. This needs tweaking still next time I'm using one clove of garlic bc that taste was stronger than I would prefer.
