One tip:  don't let the tomato curry sit and cool before serving because it thickens up too much.  The next time I made this, I used only 1 Tbl. oil and diced canned tomatoes.  After the sauce was finished cooking, I pureed it in my food processor.  For the cauliflower, I steamed it in my vegetable steamer until tender, then did a 'rough chop' to get smaller florets (which is how I see this dish served in Indian restaurants).  I then mixed the cauliflower into the pureed sauce.  I will make those changes again!  Thanks for the recipe!",

I think as suggested before by some other reviews it's a must to seperate the cauliflower into florets if you want to cook it in 30 minutes. Also I raised the temperature to 450 F and it cooked perfectly. I used fresh garlic also added fresh ginger to the sauce cut the garam masala in half and added some chili powder since I like my food hot. I didn't have any at home but next time I cook this dish I will sprinkle it with chopped cilantro before serving.",
