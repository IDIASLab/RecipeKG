I love the versatility in this recipe because I have a vegetarian; I omit the sausage in the mixture when making a batch for her, and everyone can enjoy this flavorful dish. It can be served with your favorite Italian pasta sauce for extra flair. It's delicious with side of pasta and fresh Italian garlic bread.",
