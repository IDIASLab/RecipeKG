The oil overflowed into the oven, so we pulled them out a few min early, which was fine for the yorkies, but the next time i turned on the oven, the entire inside went up in flames....  So I definitely would like to recommend this recipe, just maybe use a little less oil....  ",

I added about 4 teaspoons of horseradish to the beef and tossed it all together to lightly coat the roast beef. I also had some left over onion gravy from Sunday dinner that I used on top of the cooked Yorkies. I used my own Yorkshire pudding recipe (1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup flour pinch of salt and 2 large eggs) which fills exactly one 12-hole muffin tin to my desired amount. I put the batter in the fridge for about 20 mins. I did not use oil - instead I lightly greased the whole tin with lard (using wax paper). I preheated the oven to 450 F and stuck the muffin tin in there for about 10 minutes. Right out of the oven I evenly distrubted all of my batter in the 12 holes of the tin then evenly distributed all of the beef/horseradish mixture in the 12 holes. I baked it for about 15 minutes (until about 2\" higher than the top of the tin and the tips were heavily browned). Then topped the Yorkshire puddings with my leftover onion gravy. A hit! Thanks for a great idea / base recipe!",
