When completely frozen I removed the soup filled ziplocks from the cup molds and had a dozen servings ready to defrost on a moments notice in my freezer. This recipe is not an easy one but VERY fun to make with a friend (you will probably need help with the cheese cloth straining - it's a slow messy strain). HIGHLY Recommend for taste show and fun challange to prepare. Serves nicely with fresh tomatoe grilled-cheese sandwiches. Thank you!",

Also, the trouble of straining out the shells is well worth the effort--they add so much flavor!\r\nWhen I peeled my shrimp, I made sure I threw away the feet and only put the big pieces of shell in my pot. This way, they were easier to get out. Also, I used chicken stock instead of seafood, and I added corn at the end so that it's a delicious shrimp corn bisque. \r\nThanks for a GREAT recipe!",

It could be personal preferrence but start out easy on the spices if you're going to choose this recipe. I guess I prefer a white sauce shrimp bisque as opposed to a more cajun style bisque so I'm pretty sure it's personal preferrence. You should know though before trying it.",

After reheating it,i then added in the cream, spices, and more shrimp.  wonderful!  dinner party of 12 and everyone loved it!",

But I can only imagine what that quantity would have cost with a very similar flavor from the restaurant I always order it from. If it is your first time making it perhaps go the opposite way & reduce the recipe so you'll be prepared for the next time. Also I made one batch on the side with veg stock (Kitchen Basics brand!) for a friend and I couldn't taste a bit of difference in the end. DELICIOUS!...TIP!!!: consider getting a CHEAP mesh strainer if you can find one. Three days later and I'm still trying to pick/brush/spray all of the shrimp shell mixture out of my fine mesh strainer!",

My only word of caution is to use a mesh strainer--or better yet cheese cloth in the mesh strainer. Don't try to use only cheese cloth to strain because it has a hard time holding up to the thickness of the sauce. Lacking a mesh strainer as an emergency fix I put my cheesecloth into a colander and strained it that way.",
