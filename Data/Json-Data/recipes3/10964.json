I cooked with a cover until tender and removed the pot cover to reduce the almond milk down to zero. It did not take 25-30 minutes. I added the remaining butter and a bit of half and half as I used a manual potato masher. It was a hit!",

The milk separated as if when scolded. The taste was fine but the appearance wasn't great. They mashed up fine tasted good (I didn't use thyme - we have a thyme hater in the house) butter salt and pepper and some of the reserved milk. I still ended up tossing out quite a bit of milk. 5 stars for overall taste 3 stars for method and mess.

After they were fork-tender, I strained them over a bowl and placed them into a food processor. I added a generous pat of butter, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Then I blitzed the parsnips and added some of the milk until it became a lovely, creamy pur\u00e9e. 10/10 will make again. It was very easy and tasted like it came from a 5 star french restaurant.
