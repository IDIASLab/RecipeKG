I quartered the recipe and it made plenty probably 3-4 cups. I looked around for references because when I got done chopping the leaves I had about 2-3 times what I thought would be reasonable. I used 1/2 cup chopped leaves and any more would have been too much for us in this scaled down version. I also had a large jalapeno(3.5\" long and not skinny). The two offset nicely and it wasn't too hot at all. Maybe the jalapeno was on the milder side. I did not have red onion and so I used all yellow. Scaling Note: 1/4 recipe-one reg size tomato 1/2 c chopped cilantro leaves (not packed) large pepper 1/2 a yellow onion-no purple.",

Department of the obvious, but it's just less tomatoey, less soft because of cabbage (duh) so I can easier eat it with a fork. :)  I halved the recipe.  I gotta tell ya, unless you're feeding the neighborhood, half is plenty.  It fit in a 3L bowl  For the cilantro, I chopped 1c leaves.  It \"cooks down\" a bit as it sits, but the cabbage didn't get wilty or slimey - just as good as it was day one.  'Very glad I tried! ...

BUT this was AMAZING! No one in my house eats cabbage so I am still eating this 3 days later and it just gets better every day. The flavor is wonderful the cabbage is not limp and the jalapeno is smoother. I chopped everything in my Ninja (a little at a time) so it was a breeze to make and clean up. As the days have passed the jalapeno is not as pronounced so in the future I will most likely add more jalapeno so the heat remains longer. Definitely a keeper - and I can just imagine that fresh tomatoes will just make this even tastier.",
