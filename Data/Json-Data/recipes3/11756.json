Thanks for the great recipe!",

As I was stirring the powdered ginger into the bowl I was beginning to doubt the recipe but I really wanted to give it a try. I have a Breville Barista Express and the machine can pull a beautiful shot of espresso and steam the milk to perfection. I scooped 2 Tablespoons of syrup (which is think) into my cup and set about making the drink. I was blown away since I just indulged in a Starbucks Gingerbread Latte earlier in the day. This recipe is very close without the artificial ingredients of you were to buy it at a store. I will be making this again!",
