It needs less chicken less oil and more vegetables and seasonings. The fried almonds were okay but I think some other nut (like cashews) would have provided more flavor. I won't be making this again; it needs more than just a few alterations.",

The receipe says to also use the soya sauce at the end yet there is no other soya except that which was used in the marinade and I would not use that. The indgrideants tasted good but it had no flavour as there are no herbs or spices. I will try to doctor it and make it again.",
