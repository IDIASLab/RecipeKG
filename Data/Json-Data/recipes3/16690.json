The beauty of this is you can use any veggies. After sauteeing the veggies inn a cast iron pan I followed the rest of the recipe as is except I just mixed everything together in the cast iron pan then topped with the bread crumbs and topped with four slices of swiss cheese. Absolutely delicious!!",

I will definitely make it again this way: I saut\u00e9ed fresh chopped kale onion garlic and 3 chopped mushrooms and added that plus 1 chopped tomato into the squash mixture. I used 6 eggs and half a cup of cashew milk for the egg mixture. Also I used gluten free breadcrumbs. For spices I added a tsp salt and pinches of onion powder (a must with egg dishes!) garlic powder basil parsley and sage. Baked it in a 9\"x11\" glass dish lined with parchment paper. Delicious!!!",
