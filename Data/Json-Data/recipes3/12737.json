And, the addition of maple syrup gives it a slight sweetness.  All in all the flavor was pretty perfect!  The batter was thick and produced only a waffle that was moderately crisp outside if I left it in the waffle iron a little longer.  Of course, the crispiness will be affected by the type of GF flour you use. \n Invariably, the inside was wonderfully moist, tender - not dry at all.  I'll make this again and will try to remember to add the vanilla next time!",
