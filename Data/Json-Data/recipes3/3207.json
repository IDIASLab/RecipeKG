He doesn't like beef and I don't eat any meat and we both loved this! Our dinner guest who eats meat thought it was real meatloaf plates were nearly licked clean. I used half Gimme Lean sausage and half beef and a whole bag of Quorn burger crumbles and cooked it in a loaf pan sans vegetables. (froze the two halves of Gimme Lean for the next round) I used 1 1/2 cups Japanese style panko bread crumbs instead of homemade as I'm used to putting crushed crackers in my meatloaf from the old days and the texture was perfect. I only used a couple of ounces garlic and Italian spiced tomato sauce on the top and it was more than enough since it was in a loaf pan.",

Instead of vegetarian ground beef and crumbles I used what I had on hand -- 2 packages of Morningstar Sausage Crumbles which has a little bit of spice to it already. I also replaced the bread with Ritz crackers but otherwise I think I followed the recipe exactly. The vegetables were overdone even though I added them half way through the cooking time as other reviewers mentioned (I'll just cook them separately next time) but my fiance loved it and I don't think I've ever had meatloaf this good even before I was vegetarian. My fiance and his cousins have asked me to make this for the main course at Thanksgiving dinner this year.",

Usually there is too much breadcrumbs or oatmeal, or the texture just doesn't work. I'm a diabetic vegetarian, so the amount of carbs in a dish is important. I made this last night and it was WONDERFUL. I used ketchup on the top like my mom did and I made it in a 5x9 loaf pan. We served it with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. YUMmee!

He said it was very good even though it didn't quite taste like meat. The next night I found him eating the rest of it straight out of the pan! Great basic recipe to build on. I made some changes to make it more like my mom's meatloaf and didn't really measure anything. I made it in a loaf pan and skipped the veggies (I made mashed potatoes instead with Yukon Golds - yum!). I omitted the worcestershire sauce and mustard because I didn't have any on hand. I used corn flakes instead of bread cubes and ketchup instead of tomato sauce. I added a lot of ketchup to the mix as well as on top which I think helped it be very moist inside if somewhat crumbly. I added maybe half a large onion and several cloves of garlic that I smashed with a knife. Then for herbs I poured on a bunch of Bell's poultry seasoning till I thought it looked good. I followed the recipe on everything else.",
