I made 4 mini loaves. it was a dark pan so I baked for 25 min. perfect.  sooo yummy especially for such a healthy bread.",

I used brown sugar instead of splenda (because I don't like the fake supersweet aftertaste) nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and substituted 1/2 c. wheat bran for 1/2 c of the ww flour. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg as recommended by another reviewer (thanks!) and added 1/2 c. each chopped pecans and chocolate chips. They turned out stunningly! They were quickly gobbled down. I made 18 medium-sized muffins and baked them in silicone pans so had to keep them in 5-10 minutes longer than expected (about 30m). They came to 191 calories a piece with my changes including 6.2 grams of fat (from the pecans chocolate and flax mostly) 32.6 g carbs (including 17 g sugar and 5 g fibre) and 4.5 g protein per muffin... if you left out the choc chips -35.5 calories; no pecans = -22.8 calories; splenda = -32.3 calories (per muffin). So you could get 'em down to about 100 calories each but they wouldn't taste as good:)",
