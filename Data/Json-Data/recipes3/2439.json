All the rest of the family has had them plenty of times so they helped me with mine.I made the fajita strips in my new Geroge Forman Grill. I put the strips on one side and the veggies on the other side. It tool longer for the veggies to cook so I put those on first then the steak. When they were done I slipped them off the grill onto a platter and mixed the veggies and meat. I warmed the torillas we used whole wheet tortillas trying to eat healthy and added the steak and peppers and it was very good.It took me less than 5 minutes to cook everything. Boy talk about yoyr fast-food. We will definintely have these again. Easy to prepare great tasting sounds like a winner to me.",
