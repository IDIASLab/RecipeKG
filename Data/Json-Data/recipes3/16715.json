I used 1 cup mild cheddar and 1 cup of sharp cheddar, instead of 2 cups sharp cheddar.  I also added 1/2 cup of saut\u00e9ed onions and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.   After mixing it all together I topped it off with a little bit of mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese.   You do not need to add salt or pepper, the Jimmy Deans mild sausage has lots of flavor.    One thing I did do is, the night before I combined the eggs, cooked sausage,  spices, and the completely  drained frozen spinach (I squeezed excess moisture from spinach)  and refrigerated in a covered 9x13 dish overnight.  Next day I added the saut\u00e9ed onions, mushrooms and the cheese.  Easy!!!",
