It only took about 20 minutes to make, too! As per past reviews, I added the spinach last (after the vinegar and white wine had reduced), so that the greens wouldn't be overcooked.

I am, however, quite familiar with saut\u00e9ing spinach with garlic and olive oil, so it was basically cooking it with the wine and even more so the vinegar, that was something different for me.  I was not prepared for just how much I would dislike this. First, even tho' I cooked the spinach at the end, after the wine and vinegar had cooked out, it was still overdone. Second, the wine and especially the balsamic vinegar, completely overtook the delicate flavor of the spinach with an unpleasant, overbearing tang.  I'm afraid it was completely unpalatable to me.",
