This just didn't have much flavor at all and the texture was way too firm dry and hard to spread. IMO it just tasted like mashed and chilled white beans which needed more liquid. Sorry I hate to give bad reviews but this just didn't work for us. I followed the recipe to the T and I'll admit it could be just a personal taste preference.",
