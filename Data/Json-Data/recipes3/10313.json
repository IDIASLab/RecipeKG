I loved that bold flavor (without the celery), however the wife wanted to try the original recipe.  After running to the grocery store and adding the celery, we both agreed the crunch was nice, but the celery muted/watered down the flavor of the egg salad.  Next time I will eliminate the celery or cut the celery amount in half.  Will definately use recipe now as my prefered egg salad recipe.",

I liked that it doesn't get watery after a couple of days but it does have a odd orange hue due to the paprika. We enjoyed it over lettuce on two-tone rye toast and stuffed in a tomato. This worked well for our lunches and I will make it again even adding the paprika. Thanks SunnyDaysNora for sharing your recipe.",
