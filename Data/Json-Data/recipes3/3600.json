It comes out flaky and moist done to perfection. The compliment of the crispy crunchy phyllo is a delight! I went a bit light on the mustard and found it to be a wonderful compliment but not overpowering. I also used fresh ground pepper it is a MUCH better alternative to the already ground you buy at the store. The preparation was easy (and I had never used phyllo) and every bite was gone by end of the meal. raves from everyone!! Hope you will try it.",

I sprinkled the salmon with garlic powder and dill then topped it with some dijon mustard mixed with a little sour cream. I closed the dough over the salmon and brushed the top with butter.

The sweeter sauce went so well with the phyllo AND the salmon. I highly recommend trying this variation.
