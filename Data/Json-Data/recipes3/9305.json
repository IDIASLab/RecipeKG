I served this for a luncheon and everyone cleaned their plates. I found that it only took 30 minutes to bake although I used a stoneware pan and my oven runs a tad hot. Although I otherwise followed the recipe exactly I don't think you need a blender to mix the eggs/cream and nutmeg. A brisk whisk would work just as well I'd thing. In any case try it!",

This is a quiche in the traditional French style no cheese just the custard. I think the temperature/timing are a bit off. I reduced the temperature back to 375 after it had been baking for 15 minutes and it still was a bit browner than I would prefer so I think next time I will reduce the baking time too. But there will be a next time. Thank you Steve!",

The sun dried tomatoes really overpower the taste of the entire quiche. There is no cheese in this recipe and I think it needs some - goat cheese or feta would fit well with the flavors. Also the cook time on this quiche was quite long compared to others. The first time I have had to cook the crust first. I won't be making this again.",

I _did_ take another reviewer's suggestion and whisked the egg mixture rather than waste time putting it in a blender. Also combined the egg mixture and sauteed veggies in one bowl before pouring everything into the crust. Just a few things to watch out for... my filling was definitely too much for the crust. All I can think is that \"one bunch\" of asparagus could differ from chef to chef. Maybe I had too many veggies? It definitely overfilled the crust though. Also I think the bake time is a little high. Or my oven just runs hot. But I baked it 5 minutes less than the recipe called for and it was still awfully dark. Next time I make this I might try adding some cheese as I think that was the one ingredient that could have improved the recipe but overall a very good recipe! Will definitely make it again with a few minor adjustments.",
