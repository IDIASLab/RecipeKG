The only issues I have with this recipe are: 1.   that it presumably uses the drippings from a half pound of bacon in which to fry the onions.  Seems like a lot of grease to me.  I just leave a tablespoon or so in the pan. 2.  I double the amount of mushrooms.  They cook way down and add a lot of flavor and texture. 3.  I drain and squeeze the sauerkraut dry, but do not rinse it.  Rinsing makes a much blander dish. It's just as easy to double the recipe, considering all the prep and dirty pans,   and makes great leftoivers",

I did a few alterations to add more flavour: - used a 1lb of FRESH button mushrooms (don't use canned - yuck!) - don't strain the sauerkraut. Keep that extra marinate flavor and add it all in. - saut\u00e9ed the mushrooms and onions in the bacon fat (didn't use the recommended butter extra step; waste of a pain and why add a new fat?) - used a full 1lb of bacon. YUM. This is a new fav of mine. Definitely easy and can be modified with lower fat options (ie. remove bacon fat low/no fat mushroom soup ect)",
