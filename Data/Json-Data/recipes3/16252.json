I used 500 grams of ground beef but halved almost all the other ingredients by mistake so I think my vegetable pur\u00e9e to meat ratio was off a bit. I still used a whole egg though. It came out moist and delicious and the loaves held together well. In the end I got 828 grams of final mixture therefore I made each mini loaf about 135 grams (give or take) before cooking. I then used an entire slice of bacon on each just because and the result was a moist and tender meatloaf full of flavour. After 30 minutes the whole house smelled of this zippy tomato aroma that made you wish you could speed up the oven. I served these with zucchini noodles and it was almost like eating a spaghetti and meatball dinner. Kids and adults agreed that the flavour is unique and inviting and should enter into the monthly rotation at home. Thanks Bibi for this new twist on meatloaf thought I'd seen them all.:-)",

Metal spoons can scratch nonstick coatings while smooth wooden spoons will not harm non-stick surfaces. Even when stirring in a regular pot metal spoons can leave scratches and they make a scraping noise that can become bothersome over time. Again wooden spoons to the rescue. They won t scratch your copper aluminum or stainless steel pots and are nice and quiet to use.",
