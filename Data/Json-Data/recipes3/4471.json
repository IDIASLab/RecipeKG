Since the phyllo tart shells are not available in my area I took phyllo dough and pressed it around the cups of a muffin pan then filled the cups with the mixture. Although the recipe lends itself well to chanterelle mushrooms it can be modified easily e.g. by substituting spinach for the mushrooms. Any quiche ingredients would work. I find that this particular recipe tastes best by increasing the garlic onions cream cheese and Swiss cheese a bit and I add an extra egg. This dish is also quite suitable for brunch.",

I couldn't find phyllo shells (admittedly I didn't look too hard) so I used a cookie cutter to cut out circles of white bread which I pressed into a greased muffin tin and toasted in the oven for about 5 mins. Turned out really well! This is a nice little snack/appetizer. Thanks!",
