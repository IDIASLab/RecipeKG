For those who had problems or disappointments; This is what you do: Season all sides of chicken pieces(and yes bone in chicken works!!) with salt pepper and garlic powder; or use your fave seasonings. Place in shallow dish or bowl; and use the dressing as a Marinade! and marinate for at least one hour. Then line a baking dish with foil(dull side up)remove chicken from dressing and place in foil lined pan. Then top each piece with cheese after about 45 minutes..parmesan works best for me and return to oven for 15 minutes until lightly golden brown. Prepared this way makes it a 5 star! PS remove skin from bone-in chicken pieces",

We thought it was rather greasy and the ranch taste was pretty strong.  However, I liked the idea of it, thought it was a good blend of flavors, so I decided to attempt it again.  The second time, I poured enough ranch dressing into a skillet to coat the bottom, then placed the chicken in the pan and cooked it fully on top of the stove first.  Then I put the chicken in an ungreased baking dish and covered it with mozzarella cheese and placed it under the broiler until it melted.  This time we had a winner!!!!  We really enjoyed the meal and will have it again!!",

I use a quick spray of Pam, then put chicken breast tenders in my baking dish, or if I'm cooking for more than my husband and myself, I use whole chicken breasts, which I flatten by pounding.  I sprinkle powdered ranch dressing (Hidden Valley makes one) over the chicken, and thanks to someone's idea, put Hormel Real Crumbled Bacon on top of that.  My husband loves spicy stuff, so I chop up jalapenos and put that on top of the bacon bits.  I cover my chicken with foil and bake at 325 for 45 minutes, uncover and top with a combination of mozzerella and cheddar cheese, then put back in the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes.  This is the easiest dinner to fix, and it's so delicious.  The chicken is so tender and juicy.  I just made it, without the jalapenos, for my 80 year old mother and my 96 year old grandmother, and they loved it!",

Use 1/2 sour cream/Ranch. The grave/sauce is wonderful. This is an easy good recipe w/much potential to \"do your own thing\". I also like it w/green pepper slices & a little garlic powder.

I fry my chicken in a skillet on top of the stove with ranch dressing poured on top. I don't measure anything. It only takes a few minutes. I top it off with mozzarella or fresh grated parmesan. Doesn't need the oil. It's great! My kids also like to eat it on a nice hard roll for sandwiches. I work in the food business and sometimes have to create recipes and believe it or not this also tastes great on talapia fish. I melt butter and garlic and add the ranch dressing to make a sauce then add the fish and top with more ranch dressing and parm. or mozz. cheese or no cheese at all. Fry till it flakes easily. You wouldn't believe how much it sells when made like this!!! Ranch dressing is great on alot of things! Thanks!",

I recommend using pretty small/thin chicken pieces I used breasts and they were really too thick for this recipe. I would probably try the sour cream version as well even though I did like the ranch okay. One thing I did do differently was I topped it with crushed season croutons and it made for an awesome topping!!! I also used Italian cheese blend and cut back a little on the olive oil. It was pretty good for the amount of ingredients and time to prepare.",
