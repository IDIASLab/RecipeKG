The only change I would make next time would be to adjust the amount of butter that goes in the crushed crackers - and maybe use crushed corn flakes in place of the crackers. I wanted the topping to be more crunchy and while it did brown up beautifully it didn't have the crunch I was hoping for. Nevertheless it was delicious! I will definitely make it again.",

Because I needed my oven to prepare the ham I made the potatoes first and covered them with foil to maintain the heat whIle i msde the remainder of dinner. This was a mistake because sealing in the heat caused the topping to lose its crunch so next time I will plan better:) Thanks for sharing this yummy and super easy recipe!",
