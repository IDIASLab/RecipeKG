I made a couple changes because they were for my 21 month old. I used all whole wheat flour, brown sugar instead of Splenda. I did not use any nutmeg, nuts, lemon or orange zest and still delicious! Even if I had the orange or lemon zest I don't think I'd add it next time. Next time I think I would try to sneak in some parsnip like another reviewer did. The only mistake I made was putting them in muffin liners and they definately stuck so using just the pan and spraying or greasing would work much better. My only regret was I halved the recipe (I was worried he wouldn't eat them) I would definately double it next time because he loved them!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe :)",

I can't wait to put one in her lunch box every day for a healthy snack. By the way I had a parsnip so I added shredded parsnip and some powdered ginger for even more good health. The only reason I would not rate 5 stars - I am not a fan of orange zest and I can definitely taste it. I will make these again!",
