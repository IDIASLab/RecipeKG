Only because I wanted to pipe this frosting on cupcakes did I eliminate the cream, leaving all else the same. While I do have my favorite recipes, I'm always game to try variations.  Unfortunately, this recipe will not take over others I've tried. It was not firm enough to pipe even after a half hour of refrigeration--the point being that even if you intend to just simply frost the cake I would still do so without the cream called for.",

The taste was wonderful. I doubled the recipe and had a sandwich bag size left over. I imagine you could firm it up with more powdered sugar and be able to pipe more difficult shapes. The taste of this is so much better than icing made from shortening!",
