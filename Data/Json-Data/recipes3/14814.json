A blender, liquidizer, or food processor is a great bonus and saves too much mess (but can be made without one, you just have to chop the liver well). They freeze very well. I have been making these yummy bites for my dogs for over 20 years and have not yet had a complaint! I make double or triple the mix so I always have some spare for doggy visitors. Great to chop/crumble up and put on regular dog food if pooch has lost his appetite. Also can conceal pills very well too.",
