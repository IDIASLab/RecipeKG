I made the Ginger Dipping Sauce the Mustard Cream Sauce and Bloomin' Onion Dipping Sauce and got rave reviews for everything. I made the Empanadas 2 weeks before the party froze them on a cookie sheet then put them in a zip lock bag. About a half hour before serving I popped them frozen into the oven and they came out perfect.",
