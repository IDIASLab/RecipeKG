What caught my eye on this cake was that sour cream provided the only fat--no butter or shortening. I'm sure this is why the crumb was a little different, kind of like a sponge cake. I substituted apricot nectar for the apricot brandy and in addition to the other extracts, 1/2 tsp. of butter flavoring (anything to try and cover up that dead giveaway cake mix taste!).  I made it in a tube pan, then glazed it, top side up, with a mixture of powdered sugar, apricot nectar and a dribble of corn syrup. It's a pretty cake, tall and delicately yellow, with a balanced blend of flavors, none of them dominant. Light and moist, this is tasty and satisfying on it's own and not overly sweet.  It would also be the perfect cake to use in a trifle or just topped with fruit and whipped cream.",
