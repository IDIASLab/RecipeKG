I made baked tofu last night and didn't want to cook for dinner tonight and came across this recipe. I added in the baked tofu with the rest of the ingredients but felt it was lacking...so I added some minced garlic and more balsalmic vinegar tomatoes and spinach to make it a meal! It was really great and I was surprised!!",
