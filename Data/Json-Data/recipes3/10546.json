Instead of adding bacon bits to mix we ate the bacon on the side but I cooked the pancakes in the bacon grease. Both my 12 year old and 22 year old LOVED them! I also just put all ingredients in a bowl and mixed with a wisk to keep it slightly lumpy which is what makes pancakes fluffy. I made the pancakes pretty thick and next time I will make them thinner to get more even cooking (I'm still just learning to cook with coconut flour.) I will definitely be making these again!",
