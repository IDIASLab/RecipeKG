I didn't make a single change to the ingredients but I did put my roast (with all of the marinade) in a roasting pan with some potatoes and carrots and cooked the roast and vegetables in my oven at 350F for 75 minutes. Quicker and the pork steaks were the perfect texture. Cooking roasts in my crockpot tend to turn the roast into shredded pork. I heard my neighbors in the hall comment about how \"something smells soooooo good!\" The whole family loved how flavorful the pork was and I will definitely be making this again.",

I doubled the marinade using a full cup of worcestershire I used 2 tablespoons of Karo syrup instead of honey and used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar for the other part of the sweetness also to help brown the meat better. I used 4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons regular mustard.I used fresh garlic diced.Tripled the cloves. I didn't have lemon pepper so I used 2 teaspoons lemon juice and half teaspoon pepper. I added 2 tablespoons of rosemary leaves. I preapered the meat by washing and patting dry scored the part with the fat and forked the rest of the meat all the way around. Marinated over night. Turning after 2 hours. I am a night owl. I put all of the marinade and meat in a roasting pan coupled with some vegetable stock about a cup added red potatoes with the skins still on onion and carrots. roast uncovered at 325 for 70-80 minutes. Used the juices to make gravy melt butter in pan add flour (equal parts ) make a rue and let cook for about 1-2 minutes stirring constant. Add enough stock to make a nice thickness stirring continuely so it doesn't stick. Med heat. Let cook about 5-7 minutes.. oh so grand!",
