I've always tried to make Persian food myself but whenever I've tried it doesn't taste the same as my best friend's mom. This is the closest I've gotten so far! Excellent recipe and really easy. Update: I've since made this dish countless times and it is definitely Persian approved! I do things slightly differently though. When I saute the onions I add the tumeric. I definitely add more then a teaspoon of tumeric. I keep adding pinches until the onions are a bright yellow-orange. I also add saffron which makes this dish more authentic. I take a few saffron stems and mix them with about a 1/2 teaspoon of hot water so it becomes a liquid and I add it in the beginning to the onions. I also add the finely diced carrots when I add the barley because I find it takes a while for the carrots to cook in this recipe. Fresh parsley is also a must and I probablly add at least a cup of it finely chopped. And finally this recipe makes the barley into a thick stew and it isn't really like a soup texture. If you want to to be soupy add more broth and decrease the barley.",

The ingredients are so simple but somehow it's more than the some of its parts--it has a rich subtle slightly elusive taste that even my 8-year-old loved. The only changes that I made were to add some saffron (a good pinch) to the broth while it was heating and I added chopped fresh dill at the end along with the parsley. And the sour cream works great but you can also substitute creme fraiche--and in that case it doesn't need to be tempered when you add it to the soup you can just stir it in; it won't separate. I'm so glad to have this as part of my \"repertoire\"! I plan on making it a LOT.",

It had been in my recipe for ages before I actually got around to making it. I made it for an Iranian friend and although we both liked it enough to eat it it is unfortunately not something that I would make again. The taste was okay I followed the recipe exactly. In terms of texture a bit thick but thinning it out would not have improved it much. I guess it was just kind of monotonous to eat spoonful after spoonful. Lacked something essential but I am nevertheless glad that I finally made it. Oh well!",

The only thing I will do differently in the future is leave out the parsley. Either I'll forget about it altogether or I'll use some cilantro in its place. I had a little before adding the parsley and a little more after adding it- I prefer it without. Thanks for the recipe Autumn Leaves- this is a keeper.",
