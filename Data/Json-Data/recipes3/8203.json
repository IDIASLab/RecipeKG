I added basil pesto to the garlic and used anchovy paste along with tomato paste then deglazed the pan with a little red wine before adding crushed tomatoes. I always add a small sprinkle of sugar to any tomato based dish to avoid heartburn too. Served with crunchy bread smeared with basil pesto and Parmesan cheese over all. Skipped the lemon wedge garnish since I didn t have any on hand. Will make again!",
