I've made risotto tons of times using the regular method (add stock, stir, add stock, stir, repeat for 45 minutes) and was a little nervous about attempting to cheat.  I don't know how I managed it but this came out even creamier than my usual risotto. **Delicious** I'll be making risotto far more often than I used to.  Please note, it took much longer than 12 minutes... more like 35.  But as long as I didn't have to stand there and stir, and it came out better than my traditional risotto it's a keeper.",
