Three things boost the richness. 1.the ancho chili.... I started with a whole dried chili seeded it and ground in my spice grinder 2. Choice of beer. I used an IPA. I'm thinking a stout would be interesting too. 3. Once everything is in the pot Cook it down! Yes it is kind of watery...as some have mentioned.... however if you simmer it at a slight boil with the cover off; stirring occasionally the excess liquid goes away the meat gets more tender and the flavors are amplified...in about 1/2 hour. I used my favorite green enchilada sauce.... Red enchilada sauce would compete with the ancho and the beer and make a confused flavor I think.",
