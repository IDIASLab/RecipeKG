It's a good recipe we gobbled it up but it will taste like liver so if you don't like it don't bother. I made the recipe per the instructions with two changes. 1) I didn't have wine so I used water with a little dry sherry in it. 2) I baked the polenta in the oven while the rest was being made it saved time and stress. In case you don't know how to I prepped an oven safe dish with pam preheated the oven to 350 and put in the broth and polenta (I skipped the milk it wasn't necessary but you can substitute the broth for milk if you want creamier polenta). I stirred it up baked it for about 40 minutes stirred it once added the cheese and that was that. This was easy even with the work involved I will make this again.",
