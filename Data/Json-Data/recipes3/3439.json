Naturally, i change/manipulated a few things and used similar items i already had in the pantry.  Changes are: miracle whip instead of fatty mayo, left out the curry, used water-packed tuna, used dill relish, and used pita bread instead of the croissants (with Boston lettuce leaves).  With these modifications, it became a VERY good low-fat sandwich i will continue to make!",
