We like a lot of sauce so rather than messing with the amount of cheese for the first time making the recipe I simply skimped a bit on the amount of pasta (probably 12 oz). It was perfect. After the cheese melted and was evenly distributed I had my doubts about what would happen when I added the very liquid blue-cheese dressing & milk but I added it gradually as instructed and it coated the pasta and made a very nice creamy sauce. Rigatoni is the perfect pasta shape for this dish.",

Used heavy cream and 3 egg yolks (a little more like a carbonara). Also sauted an onion and garlic and added that later. I had some left over ham so I threw that in with some canned peas. Hubby raved about it and I thought that it was pretty good too! Only 4 stars because I didn't \"really\" use this recipe but what I created from it was awesome! Thanks!",
