I used to make my stir-fry with chicken or beef, but my husband won't have it any other way than tofu now! And my 2 year old loves it! It is a delicious, easy, quick, and inexpensive meal.

First I use The Best Thai Peanut Sauce recipe I found on allrecipes. Instead of frozen stir-fry veggies I use fresh red bell pepper a yellow pepper fresh snow peas and a can of sliced water chestnuts. I also use a light flour instead of the cornstarch. Before serving I also add a little extra sauce as my wife likes it that way. Personally I really enjoy making this dish!",

I did not batter the tofu just soaked it in soy sauce and sauteed it. I made my own peanut sauce from this recipe: 3/4 cup light coconut milk 1 tsp. red curry 1/4 cup smooth peanut butter 2 Tbs. brown or raw sugar 1 Tbs. lemon juice 1/4 tsp. salt. It was a little sweet so I recommend less sugar and adding some pepper flakes or paprika. Making your own peanut sauce ensures the sauce is vegetarian which many store-bought ones are not.",

The veggies were a little on the plain side because they're stir-fried with no sauce, so I added some soy sauce to taste at serving time. I will definitely keep this recipe for the future!",

(2) I took some frozen green beans thawed them cut onions added celery salt and FRESH ginger. Great vegetable dish. (3) My minor complaint: too much oil so I will probably use 1/4 C oil next time. (4) If you have a Trader Joe's in your area i would strongly suggest using their Peanut Sauce. Fabulous! I only have about 1 TBSP left over but it was great. I now know to not use too much sauce next I make this dish. Good luck and thanks for reading.",

Buy extra firm tofu and cut it into 1/4 to 1/2 inch squares. If you drain the tofu it shouldn't crumble. By cutting it smaller you get more peanut taste instead of tofu. I also poured the rest of the peanut sauce from the jar over the dish when I was done. I might suggest pouring some peanut sauce over the veggies too and heating through if you really like peanut sauce like we do. This makes a great left over for lunch. I added soy sauce to the rice I served it on and it was great.",

My son loves cooked carrots, tofu & peanut butter--so to throw all those flavors together into one recipe turned out to be a real HIT with my preschooler.  That means we were able to get peas, broccoli & water chestnuts into him unawares with the fabulous coating of peanut sauce.  My husband upped the hot sauce on his serving tableside, my son did not consider his own as-is serving too spicy, & this is a wheat-free recipe (for me), so it won all all fronts!  We loved the textures with the fried tofu over rice vermicelli and the crunch of crushed peanuts.  NOTE--there is a lot of peanut in here, so if you have even the slightest sensitivity, beware.  2nd note--the time to make this is underestimated.  It took lots of prep time--namely making the peanut sauce (I used a recipe from a Stir Fry book, which tasted delicious, but required some food processing).  A new favorite!",

I also added some additional ingredients to suit my taste. Instead of stir-fry veggies I used a mixture of frozen sliced carrots with broccili and cauliflower which I added to one chopped sauteed onion and three 3 cloves of minced garlic. Powdered ginger was used but next time I will be sure to use fresh. I skipped the eggs and tossed the tofu in arrowroot instead of cornstarch before cooking it in the hot oil. I used a very good prepared Thai peanut sauce and added whole almonds as suggested by another reviewer. To enhance the flavor more I added five spice powder garlic powder and soy sauce. We all loved this dish and found it was best served over rice. The almonds complimented the flavors well and added a nice crunch. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.",
