TRY IT - it is really easy and I think will definitely be a conversation piece at the table.  My guy looooved it!  I followed recipe exactly except I took the suggestions of other submitters and brushed the butter on the caulifower and then added the dry crumbs mixed with seasonings.  It adhered easily.  When it comes out of the oven - just put it on a plate and serve it with a spoon - it is so tender. P.S.  I steamed mine hrs. in advance and when the roast was almost done put on the final touches and popped it in the oven.  This is a KEEPER!!  Thanks submitter!",

This is what I did to make it turn out really beautiful and coated all over: Steamed as directed in recipe. Then I mixed all the dry ingredients(no butter) in a large cereal bowl. I sprayed the steamed cauliflower head with cooking spray then placed it upside down in the cereal bowl mixture. I used a spoon to press the mixture around the rest of the head. I placed it back right side up on a pie pan and gave it another spray all over to help it get crispy then cooked as directed. Delicious and a little healthier from omitting the butter :-)",

I don't think my four year old would even touch this if I drowned it in chocolate but he's like that with everything. I too cut mine into florets and poured the butter over and sprinkled on the rest.

I read the prior reviews and followed the frequent suggestion of brushing melted butter onto the cauliflower and then dredging it through the crumb mixture rather than just mixing the butter in with the crumbs. However even having done that the crumbs didn't stick well. Maybe a light eggwash would help? Also I steamed my cauliflower an extra 10 minutes and baked it an extra 5 but it was still a little tough. I might try this again cutting it up instead of serving it whole -- but that does seem to defeat the purpose a bit!",
