All kinds of colourful peppers asparagus thinly sliced potatoes garlic cloves fennel......the list is endless. Any oil based salad dressing works really well as a marinade. Try Greek Italian sesame ginger etc. Add fresh or dry herbs oregano for greek rosemary for Italian to the marinade. This recipe can be made the day before brought up to room temperature and used as an antipasto or as a lovely salad or side. Size of vegetable and cooking time depends on your preference. Frozen Pearl onions are expensive but chunks of real red onion are attractive and fresh.",
