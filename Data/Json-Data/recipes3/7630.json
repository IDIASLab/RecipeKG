Little update-I made this again tonight and added the juice from half a lemon into the liquid-trying to cut back on salt.  It was a great addition!

The first time I made it as written and my family and I all felt it was just ok but I liked the concept alot and the brightness of the red pepper against the goat cheese worked very well. Since we like veggies rather crisp I made it again using my mandolin and cutting the zucchini strips 3/8 thick. That was just ok too. So the third time I went back to the ribbons eliminated the chicken stock and replaced the red pepper flakes with cayenne powder. I also added 2 more cloves of garlic and another tbs of EVOO and stir fried it. Tonight we all agreed this is very good. Since my changes were made to accomodate personal preference I think the recipe deserves a solid 5 stars. Thanks for sharing we will be eating this again.",

Crushed Red Pepper gave a nice little kick. Made the dish according to the recipe including the goat cheese and shallots which I have never used before. I didn't know how much 2 large zucchinis would be but used just one about 4\" across and 18\" long. The final dish was really full of liquid cooked to directions. I didn't want to cook them too long and zukes always cook water out so the dish had more liquid when done than when it started out even with boiling. Goat cheese melted nicely and fresh basil gave a nice finish. All in all I will make again leaving out the broth and just do more of a stir fry like BigShotsMom. Great idea though and thanks! 8/12/09-Read SweetBasils comments about amount and I can say I definitely didn't have that much zucchini in the skillet which may have affected the outcome and my veggie peeler is really small so the strips were skinny. We had as leftovers the next day and my MIL thought it was really good too! It's a keeper!",

I made it as written except I had to substitute a mixture of minced onion & extra garlic for the shallots. (I made this before SweetBasil the recipe's submitter wrote about the use of onions I'm glad to know that was an intended option.) I cooked 4 cups of ribboned mature zucchinis in a large cast iron skillet. My zucchini dish never became watery (the broth evaporated quickly) - perhaps due to the use of mature zucchini and/or the skillet's heat retention & diameter. Nice to have another way to prepare zucchini with a different flavor profile.",
