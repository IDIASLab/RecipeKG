Egg salad is generally very heavy and leaves you very full afterwards and this was no exception.\nI also poured in about a tablespoon of lemon juice for some zest and used Dijon mustard instead of yellow. I realized too late that I didn't have any paprika in my pantry :( \nI slapped it on some soft fluffy bread and it made a great filling lunch and fed my avocado addiction.\n*For those who say it's bland I would say that the seasoning you add or don't add makes the sandwich. You can't blame the recipe if you don't properly add salt & pepper to your liking. The fun thing about recipes is you can add or take away whatever makes you happy. Taste test everything and season until your taste buds dance ;)",
