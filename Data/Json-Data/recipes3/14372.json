I removed the pan from the heat, then added the EVOO to the drippings with the garlic and parsley to let them mingle.  Returned the wrapped asparagus to the pan and into the oven. After 25 minutes the bacon was still mostly limp and the asparagus was getting done, so I hit the broiler for a few minutes till crispy. So, for my oven, cook the bacon half way. Was pretty good otherwise.",
