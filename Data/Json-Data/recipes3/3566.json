Butter/flour amounts are off directions don't include the chicken broth there was too much celery compared to the onion. Along with red potato I also added some shredded carrot because I had half of a large carrot to use up. I found the chowder to be a bit thin and we were not impressed with this recipe though because of my additions it was nice and chunky. Not bad but not for us. Thanks for the try.",
