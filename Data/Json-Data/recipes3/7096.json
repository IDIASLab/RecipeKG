My uncle asked if he could take the left overs home and my aunt emailed me asking for the recipe. The only thing I changed was that I added a tube of sweet thyme sausage that I ground and browned first then cooked the onions and celery in the sausage fat that I drained off of the meat. The sausage made it really robust - almost casserole-like. Warning: it will make your entire house smell like oysters when you make this so be prepared with good ventilation and lots of candles!",

You'll want to add enough liquid so that the stuffing is very wet, and give it enough time to really soak into the bread - about 15 to 20 minutes. You could easily add chopped turkey giblets, garlic and about 1/2 cup bell peppers for a little extra flavor.",

Should have listened to Courtney5Cent on this one this is beyond extremely dry. You might as well open a can of bread crumbs and stick like 3 oysters in it and dig in with a spoon because that is what it looked like...oysters drowning in a sea of sand. I had a feeling too with so much bread crumbs and almost nothing to give this thing moisture. The liquid from the oysters was no where near enough. It needs broth or SOMETHING that's liquid to balance all the crumbs but I'm so annoyed at wasting money with this recipe that I'm not going to bother with this again.",
