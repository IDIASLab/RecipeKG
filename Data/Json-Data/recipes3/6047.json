I've found that using a slightly sweet Kansas City-style BBQ sauce provides better flavor with the tuna than a Texas-style spicy BBQ sauce--at least in my family's opinion. Don't be tempted to flip them before they are nicely browned on the first side or else they're more likely to fall apart. Even if they do fall apart though they're still tasty and I like to sprinkle the broken bits over fresh salad greens for a nice light lunch.",

Together it doesn't work: it's way over the top barbeque sauce flavor and I even cut it back to two tablespoons. You really can't taste the tuna. I wanted this to be good because it is very easy to make but it misses the mark. I think canned tuna requires more delicate flavoring. In fact this recipe would probably be better with no BBQ sauce but then the name would have to be changed! You know what just fry 'em up and serve with mayo mixed with a little dill instead.",

You could definitely still taste the tuna. Making the patties small as the recipe calls for helps keep them together well. We used these in wrap sandwiches and they were a healthy quick dinner.",

I didn't have savory so I used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp of thyme. The fritters turned out delicious! I put them in whole wheat pita pockets stuffed with lettuce and drizzled them with ranch dressing. I got 5 small patties out of the recipe. Next time I will make 4 patties so they will be slightly larger. It was a quick and easy dish to prepare. I will be making these in the future.",
