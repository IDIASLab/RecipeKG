Mix in the Parmesan cheese. Refrigerate until 20 minutes before serving. If the pasta soaks up a lot of the oil, you may need to add more.

I added a cup or so of diced cucumber, as well as a couple cups of broccoli, I poured the hot pasta water over the broccoli to steam... rinsed all in cold water to keep from overcooking pasta and broccoli.  Also I added quite a bit less oregano and added in a few TBS of balsamic vinegar to increase the flavor, overall great recipe and delicious summer salad~",

This salad did a good job of clearing out the vegetable crisper - I added all ingredients to taste and came up with a winner. I appreciate this recipe for the fact it doesn't call for bottled Italian dressing which makes this salad better than those right from the start. I used fresh garlic rather than the jarred and added black olives as well as orange and yellow bell peppers. I also gave it a splash of white wine vinegar. Finally I wanted something a little smaller than rigatoni so I chose to use penne pasta instead. This is such a great combination of flavors - the olive oil cheeses and fresh herbs realy make this salad exceptionally good. I think it would be impossible for this to turn out badly.",
