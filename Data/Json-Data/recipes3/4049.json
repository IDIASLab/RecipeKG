My entire family, including the picky eaters loved it.\r\n\r\nThe only change I'd make would be to cook the dredged chicken in half olive oil and half butter first, removing it to a warm platter in a slow oven.  Proceed with the vegetables and sauce before reintroducing the chicken to the sauce to complete cooking the chicken through.  \r\n\r\nI also used fat-free half and half and it was undetectable.  This sauce is flavorful on its own and doesn't even need the help.\r\n\r\nI served this on a bed of angel hair pasta with a salad, sweet baby peas, and garlic bread.  It was an immediate hit that we'll be having again often.",

I did omit the salami and salt and used red wine instead of the sherry (out of sherry).  I returned the chicken to the pan and simmered until it was the consistency I wanted.  I served with orzo, salad, and herbed toasted bread.  Next time, I will use a  low sodium broth (was a little salty even though I didn't add salt - and I love salty), and I will mix the orzo right in while it's simmering instead of cooking separetly.

I cooked the chicken first in a mixture of half olive oil and butter. Then put the chicken on an ironstone serving platter which I had previously microwaved for 3 mintues to get it warm. This kept the chicken hot while I prepared the rest of the meal. Will make this one again for sure.",

I altered a couple of steps...After dredging the chicken in seasoned flour I fried in oil. Then I poured most of the oil out and cooked bacon and summer sausage (didn't have proscuito and salami). then added onion garlic and red pepper. didn't have marinara so I crushed 3 whole canned tomatoes and some of the juice and a little tomatoe paste. Added some italian seasoning and the rest of the ingredients and added the chicken breast to the sauce. Let that simmer and reduce and serve over vermicelli or and pasta....AWESOME!!!! BTW....if sauce is still too thin...mix 2 tablespoons of corstarch with 1 tablespoon water. add to the sauce little by little (folding well over medium high heat) to the desired consistency.",
