I omit the walnuts but add extra fruit - 1/3 cup each of chopped prunes, craisins, apricots and raisins, and one tablespoon of sunflower seeds. I use regular rolled oats, 1/4 cup of oil (instead of the stated measure). Also, I grate the apple rather than chop it and this makes the mixture much more moist.\n\nI bake in an 10 cup bar muffin tray (instead of the round ones)for around 20 minutes. The result is a golden brown, flavoursome, substantial and very filling jumbo muffin that we use as a breakfast alternative - on busy days we eat in the car on the way to work.\n\nPS. I have also used smaller round muffin moulds and have gotten about 15.",

I omitted the cranberries and nuts since the family doesn't care for them.  Didn't have quick oats, so I ground 1 cup of regular oats in the blender to make a flour.  I also made one recipe with Splenda and one with sugar.  My husband did not care for the aftertaste of the Splenda muffins, and with only a 1/3 cup of sugar, this doesn't add much sugar per muffin.  I will stick to this next time.  I shredded the apple, as well.  Very moist, yummy and good-as well as healthy!",

Here's how I put it together:  soaked the oats with the milk, egg, oil and grated apple.  While they were soaking, mix the flours, sugar, salt, baking powder, spices and raisins.  Combined the two quickly and put into a greased, standard (12) muffin tin.  Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.   They were light and moist and very tasty.  This is a keeper!",
