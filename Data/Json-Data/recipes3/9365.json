This was a bit wetter than a traditional meatloaf while shaping it on the pan, but once it cooked up it held together and sliced beautifully. I highly recommend this recipe. My grown son didn't think he'd like it (ground turkey? YUK!) but he became a real fan!",

I meal prep for the week so I had another pound of ground turkey in the fridge. I added the entire extra pound & 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs (I ran out of oats when I used the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe). The consistency was perfect after I did so. It came out perfect & the flavor was phenomenal. I'll definitely be making this again but from now on I'll be making it with 2 pounds of turkey. Also, the tomato mixture that is poured on top was WAY too much. I'll probably cut that in half next time & pour it on top halfway through the cooking time as opposed to when first putting it in the oven.",

It's firmer and the turkey is already kind of light in texture so it helps keep it from being too soft. I also used additonal veggies i had in the fridge. \n\nI used fresh mushrooms which worked out well and added about 1/3 of a cup of panko in addition to the oatmeal and it came out perfect.
