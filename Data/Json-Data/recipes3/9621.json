For flavor and color contrast I went a little skimpier on the broccoli and added red bell pepper strips, sliced sweet onion and sliced mushrooms.  This is a beautiful and deliciously flavored dish, one I\u2019m certain to make again\u2026with about half as much soy sauce.",

This recipe knocks it out of the park. My daughter is my ultimate critic and she LOVED it. I made it almost exactly as written. I didn't have any sherry so I used rice wine and it was great. I love sherry though so next time I will use that. The chicken \"marinade\" does something magical to the meat that makes it melt in your mouth. I liked that the meat was sliced instead of cut into chunks. When I made the sauce I did what lots of others recommended and kept the soy sauce the same while doubling everything else. There were no leftovers. After everyone else was finished my husband got up and spooned the last of it on his plate. (Needless to say it was good.) I served it with jasmine rice which I had sauteed with onion in a little bit of coconut oil before I added the water. Delicious! The slightly \"coconutty\" rice perfectly complemented the meal.",
