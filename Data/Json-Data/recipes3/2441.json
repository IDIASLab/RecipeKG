I made it in honor of a guest's request not because I'm a fan but that has changed. Maybe it was the fact that I used excellent sherry? Anyway it was delicious. And after dinner it looked less appetizing as a leftover so I whirled it up and now I enjoy a wonderful pate. Thanks again!",

I followed the recipe exactly except that I did not have French bread so used some Sour Dough that I had on hand and it worked just fine. I also did as Dr. Shaw and turned the left-overs into a Pate for the wife as she loves that also. This is definately a keeper and will probably make it for the next family gathering just to turn it into the Pate just for the pre dinner appitizers.",
