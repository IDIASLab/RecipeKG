This one has several steps so you can't do that but it was very worth it in the end. I recommend getting your mushrooms started while the oven is pre-heating so that they are done when the 15 minutes is up on the chicken. I do not know which chain restaurant specializes in this dish so I cannot compare it to that but this is a really good tasting recipe.",

I only made one change in that I used thyme instead of oregano as I think,ended up being a better choice with the list of ingredients of mushrooms,wine,and cayenne pepper. Really moist chicken!  I don't understand why another reviewer thought it was a bit of a hassle to make because ither then the chopping of mushrooms and onions, I thought it was easy .I did  sauteed chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts,then took the thighs out and sauteed the onions and mushrooms with the wine and other ingredients in the same pan for a few minutes then added them to the chicken thighs and baked it all together. I thought it was a downright tasty well put together dish!",

I didnt have whorsteshire sauce so i replaced it with a tablespoon of A1 Steak Sauce and it was right on! I used 1/4 cup of red wine, the \"splash\" didnt seem like enough. I normally follow all measurements in recipes down to the teaspoon but I free handed the seasoning of the chicken on this dish. I am so happy I did; it came out amazing. I used some garlic salt to season the chicken instead of regular kosher salt. It was a nice addition. I also used 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 1. I used a shredded cheddar instead of mozzarella. Not only did I lack mozzarella, but i like the taste of cheddar with mushrooms instead. Again GREAT RECIPE, I cant say that enough.",
