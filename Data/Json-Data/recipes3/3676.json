Dried parsley for me is akin to hay in flavour, so for me, fresh herbs from the garden (mixed in with the tomatoes) are a must.  I have also made this not just with crushed crackers, but also diced French bread, and stuffing mix, and different cheeses.  I have stopped draining the tomatoes, too, and just add a little more saltines or whatever.  It is a great side dish to ANYTHING, and we love to make a meal of this with just some poached eggs and toast.  My youngest calls it \"lasagna\", and leftovers are good on toast for breakfast the next day.",
