However the following should be noted: First the recipe needs to be more precise about the potatoes used. 5 red potatoes is far different from 5 russet potatoes. I used 1 medium russet and 1 small sweet potato. Second more stock is needed at least 1 more cup. Otherwise it is too dry. Lastly more herbs are needed. I added a bay leaf and rosemary. I also added some Tobasco to my personal portions. With those tweaks the stew was very nice with a side salad and a sesame seed roll.",

Also included a bay leaf rosemary cumin turmeric celery seed & cayenne; used 3 cups of broth instead of 2 cups. For a change could add soy sauce. Recipe will not look like photo - mung beans will cook down. I've baked in the oven and also prepared in slow cooker. We enjoy with rice. I'm vegetarian but the rest of my family is not.
