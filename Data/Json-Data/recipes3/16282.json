I like that this one saves a lot of time but the flavor and deep color is unfortunately lacking. Because you are basically skipping the caramelization of the onions it really is necessary to make sure there are plenty of additional flavors and seasonings added in. First off I would probably use red wine instead of white. I ended up adding in some Worcestershire sauce a splash of balsamic and some fresh thyme. Salt and pepper were also necessary. Next time I'd probably use more sherry and another bay leaf. I would also use less flour or skip the whole flour/water step. I really did not like the gravy-like consistency it gave the soup. This recipe certainly made for a quick dinner though!",
