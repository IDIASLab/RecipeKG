I added chopped onions to the ground beef as I browned it because I just cant cook without onions!  Couldn't find cocktail rye in my grocery store, so I used Beefsteak rye cut in half and it worked out fine. 5 minutes under the broiler was perfect. The cheese got a tiny bit browned on top. I think this would make a great sandwich for dinner by using two whole slices of rye bread and adding tomato and lettuce after it's broiled.  I'll make it again.   Thanks for a versatile idea!",
