I wanted to make a filling meal so I roughly sliced/chopped up two boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinaded them in 3 Tb tomato sauce 3 Tb soy sauce 1 Tb peanut oil a dash of cumin and a crushed clove of garlic (a big one). I let that set for an hour before I started with the mushroom sauce. After the aroma on the mushrooms began to develop and I tossed in the wine/broth I also threw in the chicken (minus most of the marinade). Keep at medium heat as broth reduces and the chicken will cook through. Add the cream (I used 1/4c.milk 1/4c. cream) and reduce to low-med as it reduces. It should finish around the same time as the pasta. You want to be careful not to over-cook the mushroom/chicken because if it reduces too much you won't have enough sauce for the pasta. The recipe is brilliant. You don't need the cheese or parsely really. I added some but I thought it was flavorful and complex enough without it.",

If you don't have good stock, just use all white wine.  I actually thought it tasted better to forego the stock.\n-Leave out the stalks and just use mushroom heads; the former is too chewy.  \n-The dish might do well with some spinach (for color) and chicken (for protein).\n\nMake it, and improve on it! It's got great potential as a base recipe!",

Nice blend of flavors; an attractive and delicious pasta I served as a side dish. This was sheer comfort food for me!",

I like garlic so I used 4 cloves instead of 1. Everything else I followed exactly and it came out fabulous! Next time I plan to improve it by basically by increasing the ratio of the ingredients compared to the amount of pasta because I think it could use less pasta and more mushrooms sauce etc... and of course more garlic!",
