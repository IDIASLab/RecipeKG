For the reviewer who found this was not a cream cheese consistency, it can be thicker if you allow it to drain longer.  I also use clean nylon stockings to let it drain - I use 2 layers of knee high stockings and pour the yogurt in and let it hang over my kitchen faucet over night.  It's usually a nice thick consistency in the morning.  I now plan to drizzle the olive oil over it and the chopped vegetables and use it as an appetizer - thanks for a new and improved recipe!",
