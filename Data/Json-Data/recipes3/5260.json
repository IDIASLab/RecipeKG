After reading the reviews the only changes I made were decrease the mustard to 1/4 cup add 4 Tbl apple cider vinegar with 2 Tbl sugar and a tsp of mustard powder mixed in 5 chopped hard boiled eggs and 3 sliced eggs on top of salad. In my opinion it really does need all 3 cups of mayo--I started with 2 cups and then had to add the third. I rinsed and cooled the noodles before adding to the dressing. I will keep this recipe forever. I am taking it to a saint paddy's potluck tomorrow. Yo mama knew her stuff!",

I had never made Macaroni Salad before but found myself with a half a package cooked after making Mac n Cheese the night before. This turned out wonderful with a nice kick to it. No weird ingredients -- all staples. Every time I had tasted Mac Salad before it had no appeal because it was so bland -- this I (and my co-workers) loved. My partner does not care for mustard so it wasn't a fave of his but he was the only one to say so. Everyone else -- about 5 people -- loved it! This is the recipe you've been looking for. It will be in my cookbook for years!",

I can't save it to my recipe box as written because the preferred version is my second attempt at making it with revisions as follows: Less mustard- 3 Tbsps. and the type I used was a German whole-grain dijon style. The addition of sweet red pepper relish in place of sweet pickle relish. Chopped in 1 medium red onion instead of the small green onions called for (store was out) and only 1 cup mayonnaise mixed with 2 Tbs sugar and approx 3 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (I suggest the vinegar be \"to taste\" as taste preferences vary from person to person). I kept the black olives (used jumbo size) but stuffed them with jarlsberg cheese because it together with the olives somewhat mimics the sweet/bold taste of the salad. I actually really liked that olive touch!! Thank you for providing me with inspiration to try a new type of pasta salad!",
