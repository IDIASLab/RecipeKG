I only used one can of soup broth and used the empty soup can to measure out 5 cans of skim milk. The biggest change was that I substituted the potato flakes (yuck) with my left over scalloped potatoes from Easter dinner. (they were and Asiago cheese and sage recipe). Anyway I threw them into the boiling mixture mashing as they cooked. I then took out about 3 cups of the leeks and potatoes that hadn't dissolved and blended them. Put everything back together and dined on the most delicious soup!!! I think the secret was definitely the leftover scalloped potatoes. They lent an unbelievable flavour to the soup. I will DEFINITELY make this again; in fact every time I have leftover scalloped potatoes!!",
