I used buttermilk (which I know is always great for fried chicken) instead of evaporated milk.  Also, I had concerns about frying these wings at a high temp in olive oil which has a low smoke point and isn't neutral in flavor, so I used corn oil.  These wings cooked up with a crispy coating but still juicy and tasty.",

My family was very impressed, and astonished about the taste, and crunchiness of the outside. Instead of using condensed milk, I used buttermilk, and didnt exactly properly measure the spices and seasonings. I just eyed it all out, and it cane out beautiful! Very happy about the way this meal turned out. I served it with cilantro lime rice-a-roni and broccoli florets. I also made a quick buffalo dip sauce with hot sauce, garlic powder, butter, and pepper! DELICIOUS!",
