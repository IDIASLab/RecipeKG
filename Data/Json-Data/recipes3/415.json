I thought that it was just okay since it tastes like a cream cheese brownie and I don't particularly like cream cheese brownies. If you really want to get the cake experience with this recipe I'd recommend baking it in a 9-inch round cake or springform pan. The brown and white looks good together and it makes for a tall cake.",
