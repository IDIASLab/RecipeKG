I did need to double-dredge my eggplant to get the cracker crumbs to stick well. I dipped in egg/lime then flour then again in egg lime then pounded down in bowl of crumbs to \"encourage\" a good coating. Just a dab of sauce made these scrumptious morsels. I can think of many uses for these tasty rounds...pita stuffings and salad toppings (in place of chicen in chicken ceasar salad for instance). Very nice Cindy.",
