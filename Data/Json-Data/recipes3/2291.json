I used fat free half-and-half a parmesan/pecorino-romano blend and only shiitake mushrooms (only because I did not have any other types of mushrooms). The step involving boiling off the chicken broth from the mushrooms was surprisingly worth it as it added a layer of flavor to the dish. Next time I may try light cream instead of heavy cream.",

I didn't have rosemary and thyme per se so I added about 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning: rosemary thyme sage marjoram oregano and savory. That was a good decision. I read that some cooks were having difficulties getting this to cook through in an hour and a half. Well. I cut my potatoes very thin like some were translucent kind of thin. If some slices were thicker I arranged them on the edges of the pan since they'll get baked more there. I also used a very shallow and wide casserole pan which let it bake through in 1 hr 15 mins. I used 1 C heavy cream and 1/3 C milk (my hubs and I are young and reasonably thin still;) ). I added three cloves of garlic. Great decision! We really really enjoyed this--and we'll be making it again.:) Oh and one comment: this doesn't have great eye-appeal but it's delectable just the same!",
