The first time I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was pretty good seemed like a little much for me in the morning but a good amount to fill me up. I couldn't taste the sauce very much though. So another day I tried just the ham eggs and sauce (no shallots or biscuit) and it was perfect for me. It was a little quicker to make and I could taste the sauce more. I'll probably make this again.",
