I tried one packet with the garam masala seasoning and the other packets using a marinade of whole grain mustard olive oil brown sugar lemon juice & fresh garlic. We did not like the packet with the garam masala. We don't like the flavor and thought it was bland. We did like the packets with the mustard marinade. I did not care for the vegetables because I don't think steamed vegetables have a lot of flavor and I think the texture gets a little mushy. However my husband did like the vegetables. We both thought the chicken was very moist. I would use this cooking method again but switch around the flavors and ingredients in the packet.",
