For extra insurance, after drying, dip in a little bit of flour before dipping in the egg.  This will make any crust stick, unless you're boiling the chicken.  Don't know why some people don't include it as part of the recipe....  It worked in this recipe, which is really tasty with a fun flavor.  We'll be making it again! I'd also suggest using cutlets instead of cutting strips, and eliminating the salt.",

I followed the advice of others and added some bread crumbs and seasoning (dried basil, oregano and salt). I didn't cut chicken into strips, just pounded it out some. I also coated the chicken in flour before dipping in egg and a bread crumb/parm mixture. I fried the chicken first in some veg. oil and then finished baking in a 350 oven for about 25/30 minutes. I made the wine sauce on the stove with two whole cloves in the wine and butter. I also added some flour to thicken the sauce. I used a little more wine too, Pinot Grigio, about 3/4 of a cup and I let it reduce with the garlic and butter. The result was awesome! Very cruchy coating and a great sauce. Served with white rice and corn on the cob!",

The cooking method on the other hand confused me: why go to all the trouble to bread the chicken and get a crispy crust only to add wine to the pan and make it soggy? I would sautee the chicken using vegetable oil transfer it to a sheet pan in a 300 degree F oven to keep warm and then make the wine-butter sauce for its rich flavors. Nice simple chicken dish.",
