I used large curd cottage cheese and heated it slightly with the drained pasta and spinach until it was soft and gooey - almost like biting into a small piece of soft mozzarella - also added freshly ground pepper salt and a sprinkling of nutmeg to resemble the taste of spinach lasagna.

I understand that there are some people who don't like cottage cheese so they substitute ricotta. I did not because I love cottage cheese. I made no substitutions in this recipe the first time I made it. It was delicious fast and easy! I am keeping this and will make it again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!! I made this again for dinner tonight. I did do a couple of add-ins. I added one can of chicken (no broth) and some bacon bits. I wanted to up the protein and use it as a main dish not a side dish. I think next time I will also add in some sun-dried tomatoes. I love the way spinach and sun-dried tomatoes taste together. This is an awesome recipe that lends itself to deliciousness with or without extras. Bon Appetite!",
