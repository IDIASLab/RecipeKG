I used this recipe as a topping for veggie cornbread casserole to REALLY get the veggies in there and it was a big hit! I used the diced frozen broccoli for ease and a ts of b.power bc I didn't have soda but it rose fine anyway. I think I might add some garlic to it next time to boost the flavors. This recipe's a keeper thanks!!",
