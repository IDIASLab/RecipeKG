I combine the butter with the juice of 3 or 4 large lemons and a third cup of white wine, then bring to a slight boil, reduce heat and simmer a good 5-10 minutes to reduce.  Sometimes we throw some garlic in the mix too.  I use thawed frozen shrimp for ease and toss that in and cook another three or four minutes, adding 1/2 tsp cayenne (spicy!) Then I toss in fresh spinach linguine, and coat, simmering about a minute.  Remove from heat and toss in your fresh chopped cilantro (yep, I up that too, a full bunch).  It's pretty powerful, but the lemon zing is lovely!",

I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to it and a whole cube of butter in the sauce; good thing because it would have been too dry without it!  Note to self: used 3/4 cup chicken broth instead of wine, dash of olive oil, 1/2 cube butter, garlic powder, salt, then let simmer.   Add raw shrimp(XL) (season shrimp set out for 30 mintes) in immering ssauce until cooked.  Add cooked pasta to sauce sprinkle all with a little cayenne and mix in more butter.",

I also added 2 cloves of garlic per earlier reviews. I honeslty think the tequila would make a huge difference. I wil have to try that and re-review. UPDATE: So I added two garlic cloves one small yellow onion upped the wine to 1/3 c. and the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. I also used the juice of two limes. THIS WAS SOOOOOOOO good! I am increasing my score of the recipe from 3 to 4 stars.",
