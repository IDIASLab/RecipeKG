I have an electric pressure cooker, The Instant Pot and I seared the meat in the pot prior to setting on high pressure for 45 minutes. Perfection! The meat was very tender and shredded easily. I decided to place the shredded meat in a frying pan with some hot lard to crisp it up just a bit before adding to flour tortillas with a few toppings. Loved the flavor and ease of this recipe! And loved how quick the pressure cooker was at tenderizing the meat. I will definitely make this again!",

It was just my husband & I to eat them so I quartered a 5 lb Boston butt and adjusted the spices. I did add ground coriander as others suggested. And I used Mexican oregano (just because I had it on hand). I upped the orange juice to a cup (was afraid it wouldn't be enough liquid), I didn't think about the juices fromy the roast. I put it in my Instant Pot for 40 minutes with a NPR. WONDERFUL!! I served it shredded on a corn tortillas with diced onion & cilantro. JUST LIKE A MEXICAN FOOD TRUCK!!!",

I have to admit I was scared of the thing, but I had this big pork roast sitting on the counter and the guys were coming home in an hour so I surged ahead.  Instead of cubing the meat I just sliced it up into 2 inch slabs, rubbed on the spices, jammed them in the pot, poured over the rest of the ingredients, followed the IP directions (I set it for 55 minutes).  The meat shredded itself.  So tasty - even better than doing in the slow cooker.  So impressed - I will be making this recipe again and again!  Thanks!",

I marinated the pork cubes in the orange juice and spices overnight in the fridge in a gallon ziploc bag. I put the pork in the pot, 1 cup of lime juice on top because I needed more liquid and that's what I had- plus I knew the flavor a would work well- then I added the onion and garlic on top and set my pot for 45 minutes. Mine does not have high or low pressure settings. It also doesn't have a NPR setting so I just closed the steam vent before starting and waited for the float valve to sink down. (Took about 20 minutes.) The pork was ridiculously moist and flavorful. I made a spicy radish cilantro salsa to go on top and some paleo tortillas (made with plantains and tapioca starch)  I make a lot of different recipes from apps, cooking sites and cookbooks, and a lot of them are really good, but this is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Thank you for this recipe.",

I made the spice blend as is with the addition of 1-1/2 tsp. of ground coriander and only 1 tbsp. of salt.  I let the spice rub sit on the pork for about 15 minutes, set the pressure cooker to brown and seared the pork in batches to get a nice crust.  I then added all the pork into the pressure cooker with the onions, garlic and orange juice.  I set the pressure cooker for 40 minutes and was glad I did because the pork was perfectly cooked at 40 minutes.   I served the carnitas with homemade pico de gallo, shredded lettuce, sour cream, & a squeeze of lime.   I will definitely be making this again in the future!  Thanks for the recipe!",
