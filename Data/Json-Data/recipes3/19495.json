First of all this mac and cheese is an \"eggy/custardy\" type. If you think it is like creamy mac and cheese your expectations will be different than what you get. Secondly you really need to prepare it in an oblong the larger crockpot. It makes all the difference in the consistency results. I tried the smaller circular crockpot and because it is deeper it doesn't cook throughout - just doesn't work right and produces a different dish entirely. The oblong crock of course produces a thinner dish and as a result it cooks throughout. Also it works much better if you cook on low throughout and don't try to speed things by cooking on high for the first hour. I live in NC and there is a cafeteria (K&W) here that has mac and cheese just like this - when we moved here it took a few visits to get used to it but my kids have grown up on the stuff. Also - I use reduced fat everything - milk cheese etc. Try the larger crock and you'll love the results.",

I read the other reviews and took some of their advice and added the noodles half cooked. I cooked the noodles for about 6-7 minutes then added it to the cheese mixture.  I cooked the dish for 2 hours on high and got perfect results.  The noodles were not mushy at all.  And for you people that say that you prefer the velveta stuff or whatever, this is a custard style mac and cheese, it's not a cream style.  It's supposed to be chunky!  Be sure to scramble the eggs with the milks before you add the cheese and noodles, you won't get pieces of scrambled egg that way.  Try it at least once if you like homemade mac and cheese. Don't cook it for 5 hours you'll probably get mush that way.  About 2 hours on high is all you need.  Thanks a lot for this recipe. I will for sure make this again.",

I was going for the \"one pot\" cleaning theory so I made it in the cooker bowl and I wanted to see what would happen if I was too lazy to dirty the cheese shreader (processor) so I cubed the cheese. It all worked fine. I used 1 - 16 oz block of cheese half cheddar half colby/Jack. With these changes it turned out great! Add some beans and chicken and you'll have a complete meal.",

Pour it all in the crockpot stir every 20-30 mins cook for 3 hous on low.
