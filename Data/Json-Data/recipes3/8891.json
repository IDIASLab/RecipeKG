I don't keep green bell pepper on hand, I used red instead. I made no other changes. I made sure that we all sprayed our mugs very well with cooking spray before pouring in our omelette ingredients. This turned out very cool--my kids and I were very impressed. After they finished their mug omelettes, they wanted to make another one! This would be great to expand to have little bowls of different throw in's and really make some fun omelette combinations. Thanks for sharing your recipe--my kids and I made a wonderful memory this morning.",

I've been making this for my husband to take to work and you can use any type of microwave-safe dish as long as you spray it with Pam. Watch your cooking times as microwave strengths vary - you don't want the eggs to explode. I love the combo of ham, cheese, and veggies. This recipe is a great base: use your favorite cheeses or breakfast meats and add-in whatever veggies you have on hand. You can even lighten it up by using Egg Beaters and fresh herbs! This works great for breakfast sandwiches on biscuits or English muffins or try it in a warm tortilla for a breakfast wrap. Whatever you choose it's bound to be good!",

My microwave is pretty powerful, I cooked for 1 minute and the egg puffed up really high - took it out, couldn't really stir it as it was mostly cooked.  The egg deflated and I just used a knife to move the egg around the mug, add a little cheese and back into the microwave for 30 seconds.  Make sure you spray the mug well and the egg will just slide right out.  BTW - this is great with just one egg in a ramekin for one minute.  Perfect for making egg McMuffins.",

The omelet was in between a slice of American cheese on the bottom and Canadian bacon on the top and sandwiched onto a toasted  English muffin.   This time I used Southwestern Egg Beaters (1/4 cup for each sandwich) which tasted delicious.  With the two ramekins going into the dishwasher and hand washing one small skillet for the Canadian bacon, the cleanup was easy (no more messy egg rings to scrub!).

She doesn't eat pork so instead of the ham I have used turkey ham or a good quality and also I make the omelet a bit larger using 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites.
