I tend to broil or grill steak as I have not had much success with steak on the stove top. This worked well, for me, though. I used N.Y. strip. Mine, I realized, were kind of on the thin side so I halved the other ingredients. I used butter with canola oil to make the butter/oil measurements quicker. I cooked the onions on medium until I just noticed some light browning. The original recipe did not indicate, but I removed the onions before adding the meat with a slotted spoon. I started the meat on medium, but had to turn it up to about 6.5 to finish browning. I was worried that the whiskey would be too strong, because I don't care for it. However, it more or less just tenderized it. I poured it directly over the steak and added about 1-2 more minutes to the steak. I did not cook the caramelized onions in the whiskey either. I enjoyed my steak. ty",
