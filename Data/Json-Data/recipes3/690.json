I didn't feel it had the strongest chocolate flavor, however, and tasted too \"sugary\". I melted two squares of unsweetened chocolate and whipped it in - the flavor improved greatly and the texture was not compromised. I think next time I'll leave the cocoa powder completely out and just use unsweetened squares. Thanks for sharing.",

So I was looking for a very chocolatey frosting specifically for cookie-bars. When I followed the recipe exactly as written I loved the texture but barely tasted any chocolate at all. It didn't even look chocolatey-- just very light brown. After adding several squares of baking chocolate it's just okay. It's better than no frosting at all but not really what I had in mind.",
