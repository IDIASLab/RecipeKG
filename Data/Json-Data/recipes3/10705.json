It was really good, especially for something so easy. The liquid part looked a little strange--tiny bits of ground turkey throughout--but my family didn't seem to object. I think I might brown the turkey and drain it next time, but it was okay as is. I would also add more beans next time because I like lots of beans in my chili. Oh, and one other thing--I was doubling it but the store was out of crushed tomatoes, so I used one can of crushed and one of petite diced tomatoes, and it added some nice texture.",
