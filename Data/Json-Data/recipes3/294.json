At the Whitestone this is their signature dessert and they call it Whitestone Delight Pie.  I order it for dessert every time we go there, and have since made it myself.  It is excellent and so easy to make!  It is more than delightful; it\u2019s divine, decadent and delicious!!  9/13/10 UPDATE \u2013 I made this again for a dinner party for 14 people.  I made a graham cracker crust in my 10\u201d springform pan.  I made all of the filling and all of the coconut/pecan mixture.  Worked perfectly.  I cut this into 16 servings, so they were a modest size, but that\u2019s probably a good thing because this is so rich!  It was a hit!  One suggestion:  Take this out of the freezer about 20 minutes before serving.  If you allow this to thaw completely it becomes too \u201cloose\u201d and sort of sags on the plate and doesn\u2019t hold it\u2019s shape.  Still yummy, but not as pretty.",

The first time I made the pies, I actually forgot the caramel on one, so I ended up doing one pie with the caramel and the other without. After reading the reviews saying it was too sweet, I have to agree. The caramel one was much too sweet, but the other was perfect! I use the recipe now to make a coconut and pecan cream pie. Everyone has loved it and asked me for the recipe!! If you think it's too sweet, just don't add the caramel... delicious!!!",
