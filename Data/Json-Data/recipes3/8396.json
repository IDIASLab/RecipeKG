I would suggest using fresh pineapple. I used some of pineapple on the store shelves. It didn't give it a bright color. Also sitting in juice it may have made it more sweet than it should be for the recipe. The pineapples are very dominant in this. I used lemon juice instead of lime juice. Maybe the lime is needed. I also subbed jalepeno for the serrano like most others. Now I just have to figure out some way to use this the best way. On the first day I used it on a quesadilla which was okay. It made it kind of sweet. I did half of the recipe and it still made about 2 full cups easily. I hate to waste food but it has been sitting in my fridge so the rest will more likely get tossed.",
