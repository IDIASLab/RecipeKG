Has just enough sweetness with just enough kick. I did not have white-wine vinegar so I used red-wine vinegar instead but it turned out beautifully anyway. Just don't use full white vinegar--too much tang that way. Really excellent and pretty simple recipe. I used organic honey with no ingredients other than 'honey' in it. I highly recommend it for a slightly sweet dressing for any bitter greens or chicken salads.",
