Now anytime I crave this I whip it up at home, except I make it fancy by serving it in a pretty glass instead of the traditional Styrofoam&reg; cup. No matter how you serve it the taste is sweet, crunchy, fiery, and juicy.  This is a very loose recipe. Feel free to adjust the proportions of lime juice, crema, cheese, and spices to taste!",

I have to say the basics are there but the crema and lime juice per cup seemed a bit much but this is something that can be customized per a persons taste. Typically from when i've seen corn in a cup sold you can make your cup how you like for the most part. I instead mixed crema and chili powder together and dalloped on top of each cup of corn (and then added the cheese and hot sauce) and topped with a lime wedge to squeeze on top. I also sprinkled Tajin on top instead of salt.",
