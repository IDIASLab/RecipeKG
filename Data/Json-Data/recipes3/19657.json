Then substitue 1 of the cans of cheese soup for cream of mushroom.  Also to the soup add a healthy sprinkle of Lowery's Season salt(or Johnnys if you prefer).  When you cheese the top, use 2cups shredded cheese.  Then cook for 1hr and 15 min(the larger pan means longer cooking time. Good Recipie, I btought 3 pans of this to church poluck, they scrapped the dishes CLEAN!",

Yukon gold are especially good.  If you substitute celery soup, you will need 1 cup of grated cheese.  Bake 375 covered 1 hour, uncover & bake 15 min, sprinkle with paprika.  Yum. I like this recipe because with using cheese soup, you don't have to use as much cheese.  Don't skimp on the onion!",

I took the advice of others and used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup, 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1/2 chopped onion, 1/2 cup milk, black pepper, garlic powder and salt in the mixture.  Layered it and covered it in the oven on 375 for 1 hour.  Put the shredded cheddar on top and let it melt & brown for about 10 minutes.  I also left the skin on the potatoe.  MAN O MAN.....LET ME TELL YOU.  This recipe is simple, delicious & is the BOMB.  It's a keeper & in the Recipe Box.  Thank you for sharing!  (I am going to add 1/2 cup of sour cream next time)....Yummm",
