When the dry cake is covered evenly, it is crisp and buttery in the finished product (which is NOT supposed to be cake-like, but more of a fruit crisp.) Delicious!",

The pudding mix is unnecessary as most cake mixes already have pudding in the mix. By adding more DRY pudding one may end up with a gelatinous type substance. Coconut will also make sometimes make things a bit on the dry side.(ever put coconut in a sweetbread of some sort?). Most dump cakes call for AT LEAST 3/4 cup butter. When you add it all up it is no wonder that most reviewers end up with dry cake mix on top that does not go anywhere (but perhaps in the garbage).",
