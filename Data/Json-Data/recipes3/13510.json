I was a little concerned after adding the eggs to the creamed butter/stevia mixture as it went from smooth and fluffy to odd and granular. I really thought I'd done something wrong; but continued on with the recipe and the batter did look better after adding the milk and flour mixture. I got exactly 12 cupcakes and they baked in exactly 20 minutes. I also did not grease the cupcake liners and I had no issues with them sticking. The whipped frosting is ok but I think I prefer the cupcakes without it.",
