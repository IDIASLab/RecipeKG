This could have easily been a 5 star recipe had I read through half of the reviews. \n\nThe two key issues I had with this recipe:\n\nCalling for milk. It should just be changed to half and half or cream - because the milk seperates - which is not at all appetizing.\n\nHaving the bacon in from the beginning. The result is almost like an uncooked texture by the end. It should be cooked, kept aside and almost added as a granish upon serving. Leaving the bacon fat in at the beginning stage will impart the flavor and not sacrifice the bacon's texture instead.\n\nGranted - I should have instinctively not done both of these things - and will amend if I make this again.

I did make a couple changes:\n\nI cooked the bacon in the soup pot until it was crispy, then removed the bacon and sauteed the onion and celery in the bacon fat. I crumbled the bacon and added it back at the end to keep it crunchy. I found I didn't need to dirty two pans for cooking the bacon and then simmering the soup. I omitted the butter and definitely didn't miss it! Also I drained the can of whole corn and I peeled the potatoes (it wasn't clear in the recipe if I should).\n\nAll in all, the best corn chowder I have ever eaten!!\n",

I made a cooked roux with the grease from the bacon probably about a quater cup of flour or maybe more for a rich chowder. The way the recipe reads it is very thin. add plenty of salt too. try and see whats up..yum yumm very good base recipe though",

I did change the recipe a bit by adding garlic in with the onion and celery and using cream instead of milk and omitting the flour.

I then browned my onions and celery also using a few dashes of garlic powder(or fresh if on hand). I then added my stock after about five minutes and then proceeded with the potatoes and carrots and a can of creamed corn, I let this boil for a bit and another burner warmed up about a cup and a half of half n half. Once I added my cream I then added about a cup of frozen corn as I think it has a much better flavour than canned. And to thicken I did not use a roux but instead keep these perfect little portioned packages of dehydrated mashed potatoes(the kind you would add your butter  and milk too...) I find these are a much better thickener and have the yummy taste of potatoes as opposed of a floury taste. I seasoned with some crushed black pepper as it did not need salt. Perfect!!",

I left out the bacon and used vegetable broth.  I also cut the fat a bit for health reasons by using skim milk and light butter, leaving out the bacon helped with that too.  Nutrition changed to 142 cal, 1.9g fat, 0 cholesterol, 4.82g Protein, 599mg sodium and 2.2g fiber.  The soup came out very creamy, better than most I have had out at restaurants.  Thanks again.  :)",
