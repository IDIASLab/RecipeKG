                "reviewBody": "Well I should have gone with my intuition here. I was sort of taken aback that this recipe should call for \"1 pound of ground beef or more to taste.\" As it happens the massive amount of milk called for made beef soup. I ended up adding an additional pound of beef and another 2/3 cup of grits -- to texture not to taste... and I still felt it was a little loose. Flavor wise this meatloaf is unimpressive at best. Perhaps if I hadn't had to double the meat and triple the grits it would have been better but the cocktail sauce might have been overpowering too. I couldn't get excited about this meal despite the fact that I think grits in meatloaf is conceptually brilliant. No applause from the peanut gallery either. I am inspired to experiment with them in the future.",

I don't think the onion made a difference in the amount of liquid, because the mixture was very loose before I cooked it.  I could not form it into a loaf but rather had to pour it into the pan.  I probably will try this again, maybe with a bit less liquid or maybe an extra egg.",
