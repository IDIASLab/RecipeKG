I skinned the thighs and also omitted oil altogether. I omitted the curry powder and keep it more mideast than Indian. Allspice is a commonly used mideast spice and when I got the marinade together(also crushed in 1 clove garlic) the allspice seemed a bit overpowering so added another tbsp. lowfat yogurt. The thighs were tender after marinating overnight and baked up nicely. Served with jasmin rice. I will make again because of ease of prep and ingredients that I always have plenty of on hand. I think next time I would omit the prepared mustard and use lemon juice instead.",

Being a metro Detroiter I m accustomed to good Lebanese and this meal didn t fall short. I omitted the curry power from the marinade but otherwise followed the directions. The prep was easy the night before. I grilled the chicken on skewers for about 8 minutes per side over a medium low flame. The dipping sauce was nice but I did add a little extra garlic and pur\u00e9ed. Now if I can only find a recipe for La Shish's garlic sauce this meal would really be complete.",

I didn't get it in the marinade until late in the morning so it didn't sit as long as I would have liked. Even so, this turned out really well and we all really liked it. I think next time I make this, I'll switch the amounts of the allspice and the curry powder. I think maybe that those two ingredients were switched, but I've been wrong before. There really was just too much allspice for us--that really overpowered the rest of the flavors and spices. I'll also be sure to marinate it longer next time. I'll make this again for sure. I served this with Company Couscous and we all really enjoyed the combination.",
