I served it with basil pesto sauteed mushrooms and herb angel hair pasta. it was a huge hit, not a clean plate left.",

I microwaved the Zucchini Boats with a spray of olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt for about 5 minutes before I stuffed them. I used vegetarian Seitan chorizo to make this a vegetarian dish. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used about 3/4 can of chopped fire roasted tomatoes with adobe. I also added some sliced mushrooms and a handful of fresh spinach leaves. I used more like 1 1/2 Tbls of basil pesto. Since I added a few more ingredients the topping didn't all fit in the zucchini so I saved it to scramble with eggs the next morning. YUM! I can't wait to make these again. Next time I will probably chop up the insides of the zucchini that I scooped out and add it back to cook with the chorizo mixture instead of throwing it away.",
