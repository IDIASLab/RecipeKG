I also used a mayo alternate at double the recipe used way more of the habanero hot sauce cayenne turmeric and creole seasoning...all to taste with a good amount of salt and pepper. Oh also 3 small mangos to balance the spice. Very very good. I'll add this to my recipe box for sure. So moral is taste the dressing as you go and add to it if you think it needs more oomph. Enjoy!",
