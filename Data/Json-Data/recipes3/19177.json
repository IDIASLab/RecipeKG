Here are the changes I made to make it a winner: 1) Slice chicken breasts into 1 inch strips, sear in 1 stick of butter until just browned. Put half of the rice mixture on the bottom of the crockpot.  Pour chicken / butter mixture into crock pot. Put about 3/4 c. shredded parmesan on top. Pour the rest of the over the rice / soup mixture on top. Cook on LOW for about 3 hours but no more or the chicken will dry out. High should not be used at all.",

I omitted the rice altogether, as we're not big rice fans.  I also used an Onion/Mushroom dry soup mix.  I only had three fat boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but didn't alter the amount of liquid.  I sprayed my crock pot dish with Pam.  Put a pat of butter on each breast, poured the soup mixture on top of that and lotsa parmesan on top of that and turned it on Low for about 8-9 hours.  De-Lish-Us.  Made up some egg noodles and green peas and a salad and scarfed it all up.  This one went into my recipe book.",

The rice turned to mush and the parmasean burned in the pot (cooked on low for 8 hours) plus it was WAY TOO SALTY. The chicken on the other hand was absolutely WONDERFUL! If (and I mean if) I make this again I'll do it with 1/2 the onion soup mix and more milk in the soup. Leave out the rice and cook seperately then serve your mixture on top or on noodles. Proceed with caution if you make this recipe and be prepared for a mixed result!",

My answer to that is not to use canned chicken broth.  Instead, try using homemade chicken stock (Chicken carcass, carrots, celery, onions, cold water, thyme, rosemary, sage and simmered for 3 or 4 hours then strained.).  Also, as someone commented, NEVER cook on high, always on low heat and for about 6 hours and the chicken turns out really tender and the rice is just right.  I really loved this one.  :)",

However just a note I cooked mine on \"high\" setting and my meal was done in 3 hours oppossed to the 4-6 hours the recipe recommends. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!",

I will make this again. Thanks.",
