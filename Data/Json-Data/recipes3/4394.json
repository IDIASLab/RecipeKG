I vary between these two versions to keep it fresh with my family, since it's a quick weeknight dinner. ",

Also mixed in some frozen corn and the Cheese Whiz and then let it simmer for about 10 mins. Followed the rest of the recipe. I was a little disappointed that the shoestring fries didn't get crunchy. My kids loved it...8 yr. old son with small appetite cleaned his plate and announced that he loved it...so that makes it a keeper! For some reason this kind of reminded me of Hamburger Helper but that's okay I rely on it sometimes. Next time I might try shredded cheddar cheese like some reviews suggested. I may also try a different type of potato. Thanks for a recipe that we all enjoyed!",
