This adds a wonderful cheesy, garlicy flavor. Also, instead of slicing the zucchini into rounds, I diced it into chunks, this way it cuts nicely but still gives a great consistency to the mix, and I used 2 instead of the 1 that was suggested. , lastly, I doubled the amount of onion and diced it, instead of grating so that it doesn't lose it's texture. One thing that is really delicious (if you're a veggie lover) is to grate one yellow squash, plus one carrot into the recipe. This not only adds some wonderful color, but it's a great way to get more veggies in. ",

I was pretty skeptical of a crustless quiche, and even more so when it came out of the oven and was a different color than I expected (brownish/slightly green) but, man was it good! The edges browned and were slightly crunchy so the lack of a crust wasnt a problem. Plus, it is healthier this way. I chopped my (VERY large) zucchini, added a chopped carrot and some mushrooms, baked for exactly 30 minutes and it was perfect! will definitely make this again, it was so easy...and everybody is impressed by a tasty quiche :-)",

The first time I followed the recipe and we weren't all that impressed, we all thought it was rather bland and I was unsure what the submitter had in mind with 1 zucchini.  Small? Medium? Large?  This second time I used a full cup of diced sweet onion, 3 cloves of fresh garlic, minced, 1 small zuke, 1 small yellow squash, sliced, and half a red bell pepper in large dice.  I increased the parmesan to a full cup and added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne.  This was spicy without being too hot  I think the addition of the red pepper improved the eye appeal.  Thanks for a good jumping off point.",
