The only difference is that they added a little bit of fresh mint, they taste great with or without though.  The traditional way to eat these, I was told.. is to hold it in the middle of a pita bread and slide the skewer out while gripping.. top it with cucumber, tomato, onion, sour cream/yogurt/tzitzki sauce etc. As stated by other reviewers this recipe also makes excellent burgers and meatballs!!  I've also made these with my favourite hamburger recipe and served on hotdog buns with bacon, cheese and other more traditional burger toppings, gr8 for kids!",

I made a sauce from the 'Middle Eastern White Beans' recipe on here to pair with this. The only changes I made were to add 1 egg and 1 yolk italian bread crumbs and a bit more cayenne and allspice. I baked them in the oven and popped them into the sauce. I have to say that they are really great as meatballs; especially after they have sat for a while. The flavors seem to blend. I would love to try these in the summertime for a barbeque on the grill. Thanks for the recipe and helping to make a quick change of dinner plans.",

I was expecting a very flavorful meat with a nice fresh taste from all the fresh parsley but it just tasted like plain ground beef with a hint of allspice and a little kick from the cayenne. I felt like it was missing something or a lot of things. It wasn't horrible just not what I was hoping for and I will definately not use this recipe again.",
