Actually we loved them but in my opinion the recipe need modifications. I used just 4 corn for this amount of other ingredients and this was enough. The previous time I used 8 corns as the recipe says and the corn overpowered. We felt just corn. Be sure to grind corn in a blender it makes the difference. I added more basil and cilantro too. Delicious but it is a time consuming recipe.",
