This Vietnamese banh mi sandwich is awesome, and it is a nice break from common sandwiches. The garlic chili sauce is common in Asian sections of markets but Indonesian sambal or Korean chili paste can also be substituted. Beer or red wine is the beverage of choice for this authentic recipe of French-influenced  Vietnamese cuisine.",

I would like to offer a few additions to this basic recipe.  That is, try adding some sliced jalapeno chilies if you like some spiciness.  The local shop also sprinkled some Maggi seasoning sauce.  One thing that has been left off of this recipe that I have never seen NOT included is shredded marinated carrots.  Finally, consider marinating the pork and charbroiling it.  You also might consider pulling out some of the bread inside each sliced half.  I know this sounds a bit wasteful, but it will make it much easier to manage and hold all these ingredients/fillings.",

No leftovers. Clean plates. No dinner conversation. Just lots of crunching and half-closed eyes while hungry people devoured these wonderful sandwiches. While I had been leery of the hot sauce, the lime juice seemed to magically cut it so that it was indeed not too hot for everyone to enjoy, REALY enjoy! This will go on our list of things to serve company in the future. \n\nWe prepared all the ingredients for this recipe and then when the meat was ready had fun assembling our own sandwiches.  I had purchased a boneless pork loin and had the lean end cut into twelve quarter-inch slices that we broiled. We used whole wheat hot dog buns. While the buns were great for the shape of the cucumber slices, I think a whole wheat hamburger or Kaiser type roll would have held up better to the lime juice. They were so delicious though; no one seemed to mind that their sandwiches kept getting soggy with the extra lime juice we kept squeezing on ?",

As mentioned earlier, the loin chops need to be seasoned, it was too bland for my liking. Pickled carrots and daikon (chinese radish) is a must (julienne carrots and daikon and put in vinegar and sugar to marinate). Also, pate needs to be in there (it may sound gross to some but it's a Viet's replacement for the mayo). Add Maggi seasoning soy sauce as well. Thai chili peppers can be added for more spice as well as chives. Lastly, lightly toast the baguette... it gives it an extra touch.  Happy eating!",
