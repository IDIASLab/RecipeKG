I also ready from the person who originally wrote it that there was a type so pay attention to that. I had 2 very big boneless breasts that I cut thru the middle to make 4 thin pieces of chix. I don't really know the weight for the chicken I used. I did juice from one good size lemon and used only 1 1/2 cups of chix broth. When I made my cornstarch mixture...it was a good 4 teaspoons mixed with 4-5 teaspoons of water. I didn't bake anything. I just made the sauce. Seared the chicken. Than added sauce to chick pan and put on low with cover on until done. OH SO YUMMY!!!!",

I added 1 chopped shallot, plenty of chopped garlic, and a ton of freshly cracked black pepper to the butter after i cooked the chicken and before I added the broth/wine.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of wine, as I prefer a stronger taste. I then put the chicken & sauce in a pan and threw it in the oven (just to make sure the chicken is cooked completly) The chicken came out SUPER juicy!  This was EXACTLY what I was looking for !! \r\n\r\nI also used the extra flour to thickin the sauce.\r\n\r\nmmmmmmmm !!",

I also used re-hydrated parsley flakes. I think the sauce could have been a little thicker. I mallet-hammered my chicken and made medallions. Hubby said \"I'd give it a 5\" and it was gone in a blink. The chicken was OUTRAGEOUSLY tender. I did use cooking sherry instead of white wine because it's hard to buy wine where I live and I was out. I will definitely try it again with all the exact ingredients and maybe a smidge more cornstarch. This chicken REQUIRES bread to soak up all the delicious sauce. Thanks for a yummy meal!",
