My family loves it  - truly best ever. and not the same old same old.  \r\n\r\nI used 1 lb of beef (less), 2 eggs (more for better consistency), 1c salsa, 3/4 c oatmeal, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and chopped onion (dehydrated or fresh), plus a SMALL handful of brown sugar.  sprinkle the bottom of the pan with brown sugar, add meatloaf and sprinkle top with brown sugar.  bake at 350 for 1 hr.  sounds odd but it's terrific.  I hope your family agrees.",

Also if you only use the pan as a mold and actually bake it on a baking sheet it allows the meatloaf to cook in 3/4 the time.  When you bake it this way you can put a sauce on the sides too for added flavor.  My favorite sauce is to mix 3 parts kechup to 1 part steak sauce such as A1.",
