Once they are frozen I bag them and keep them in the freezer.  When ready to cook I pull out one or two cubes (each cube should be about one tablespoon).  Freezing it will preserve the flavor and it will last longer.  I learned this from my mother and it really works well.  When I make my bulk I share with my daughters and they do the same with it.  I don't add salt to the sofrito recipe until I am ready to cook.  Happy cooking!",

The only difference between this recipe and mine is that I don't use green bell pepper, instead I use Cubanelle peppers (I've also seen them called Italian peppers or Italian Frying Peppers).  It's a long light green pepper and it's got a much better flavor than green bell pepper.  I also don't add salt and pepper (I add those when I actually cook with it).  If you don't want red bell pepper or tomato...leave them out and what you have left is a mixture called \"Recaito\"...I use recaito when I make habichuelas (bean stew).  I have very picky friends and relatives but whenever I make my arroz con gandules (yellow rice with pigeon peas) or arroz con maiz (yellow rice with sweet corn)....they have 2 or 3 servings, and what makes them taste so good is sofrito baby!

I don't use the culantro or red pepper. I just use onion green pepper garlic cilantro and sometimes in a blue moon I spice it up with a jalapeno or serano.
