I coated the chicken as the recipe says garlic powder and pepper but my \"oatmeal\" mixture was different. I didn't have any oatmeal so I used my daughters gerber oatmeal it worked! ALSO I omitted the MSG I mean really you don't need it! I made the batter mixture as called for but next time I will cut WAAAY back on the basil and oregano. I used a bit of sesame oil in a pan on the stove top to cook the chicken (vs deep frying) as it was cooking I could see it was looking kind of dry so I (FYI didn't measure anything from this point on!) added a few splashes of soy sauce and a few (generous) squirts of honey then I sprinkled some additional sesame seed on the chicken when it was just about done and it was FABULOUS this way! I served it with rice (of course) and sizzling rice soup from this website. My husband loved the whole meal and said it was way better than any chinese restaurant! The recipe sounds authentic so I am sorry if I messed it up by adding all the extras but it was so good!",

I marinated chieken tenders in sesame oil and garlic powder plus added extra sesame seeds because we really like sesame. I also made a gravy/sauce using sesame oil/butter roux with chicken stock. We will make this again and again! Sorry for the changes but this was a terrific idea!",
