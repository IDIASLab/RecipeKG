The sauce is delicious and if you re serving over rice or noodles you may want to consider making more of it. I like the idea of a chopped green onion garnish for some eye appeal but I wouldn t use the 1 green onion pieces next time rather I d opt for saut\u00e9ing slivers of a regular sweet onion (personal taste preference here). I also could see substituting part of the olive oil with sesame oil since I think the sesame flavor would be a good partner in the sauce. Super simple to make nice enough for company but easy enough for a weeknight dinner. Also I think pork tenderloin would be a good variation on this recipe and equally good. Served with spicy sesame linguini and creamed succotash.",

I didn't have plum jam so I used a 30 oz can of whole plums - seeded and blended, then made a sauce in the skillet with 2 T of cornstarch added to the reserved plum juice.  combine the cornstarch and juice in a jar and shake to get rid of lumps before adding to th skillet.  If you like it a little sweeter add 1 T. of brown sugar.  I also substituted 1 chopped small onion and added 1t. of chopped garlic.  The rest of the ingredients were the same.  This makes enough sauce for 8-12 chicken thighs but you will need a very large skillet.  I simmered the thighs in the skillet to make sure it cooked through the thicker pieces. Serve over Rice.",
