I leave out the onion add a half cup of sugar and mix all the cheese into the batter- just our preference. If you don't have buttermilk normal milk works fine the batter is just a bit thinner so reduce the amount you use. Also I use fat-free cheddar (kraft pre-shredded) in this recipe. The bread is so moist that you really don't notice you're missing all the fat. One note is that the batter is VERY moist- I cook mine at 400 for an hour or so. It is very soft when it comes out of the oven but will firm up as the cheese cools. Give this one a try- you won't be dissapointed!",

In my cast iron skillet, mine was done at just under 35 minutes. I took a tip from a girlfriend of mine and melted butter in the skillet in the hot oven before adding the cornbread batter for a buttery, crispy crust. We all liked this a lot. The flavor of this cornbread was wonderful. I'd like to try this next time with Mexi-Corn and see how that is in this recipe. I think it would be good with pepper-jack, too. Making it in the cast iron I think is what made it SO good. But, isn't almost anything made in cast iron good? ;)",
