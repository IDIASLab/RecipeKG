Tossed w/blue cheese just prior to serving.  The only change I will make is I will use less blue cheese next time; it tasted great, but it's strong enough I can cut some fat/calories w/out sacrificing taste.  What a great, easy, healthy, inexpensive side dish!  Thanks for a new staple at our house.",

I grilled the leftovers on toasted multigrain bread with mozzarella melted on top the next day - and it was good too.",
