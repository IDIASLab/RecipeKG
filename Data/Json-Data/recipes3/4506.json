Hollow the eggplant halves to leave a very thin layer (1/4 inch) of flesh so that when it bakes the remaining flesh is cooked tender and pulls easily away from the skin... I deglazed the pan with some of the vinegar from the capers jar to get the great caramelization from the bottom and added it to the bowl of stuffing... I also substituted Pecorino Romano cheese for the Gruyere (because that's what I had)... I really was surprised at how well it turned out... I will definitely invite guests the next time I make this!",

Great recipe and this is how I tweaked it :  mixed parmagian instead of gruyere, topped with bottled sun dried tomato and black olive Safeway spaghetti sauce and some mozzarella.  To those that say this is labor intensive: don't scoop eggplant out, take a small sharp good knife and slice halved eggplant in square grid to within an 1/8 th inch of shell(If you break through shell it doesn't matter, it will still hold stuffing)carve out chunks by running knife along sides of shell and as close to center as you can get, pull or cut out chunks then put chunks in the food processor and pulse. You might also use food processor to chop onions and throw in the garlic cloves with them while you're at it.  Bake shells at 425 for 10 minutes while you're cooking chopped chunks, onions, etc.. Take shells out of oven and turn down oven to 350 and by the time it cools to that temperature, the shells should be stuffed and you should be ready to bake those perfectly stuffed  eggplants.",
