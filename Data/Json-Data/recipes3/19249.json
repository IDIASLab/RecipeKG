I added chopped onion and garlic and threw in some frozen GREEN BEANS to round out the meal (I served it over orzo with the extra sauce). Really good! Be sure to use a Bloody Mary mix that is to your liking (Mild or spicy)- that may have been the problem that some other reviewers had - I can't imagine anyone not liking this! Thank you! UPDATE: 05/19/10 Still making this 8 YEARS later! I use Mr&Mrs T's bold & spicy 'mary mix w/ bone in/boneless chicken. As with ANY recipe SEASON TO TASTE! It smells great & tastes great - serve over rice pasta quinoa; you can throw in frozen veggies (if using fresh veggies throw in only for the last 2 hours.) A terrific recipe in my regular rotation. I've made this so many times now & everyone has always loved it.",

I added 3 chopped celery sticks and a green ball pepper (dont eat after though it gives chicken a great taste but is very bitter after cooking so long). I also added about 2 tablespoons of Tabasco sauce. After chicken was cooked through I SHREDDED it then put it back into the sauce for 15 minutes to saturate. Served over rice. It was so good!! I made a couple times according to the recipe but the breasts came out so dry. The bloody mary mix is a brilliant idea!",

I seasoned the chicken with crushed garlic pepper and celery salt. Poured Mr & Mrs T's bloody Mary Mix over it added cubed cream cheese evenly around the crock pot with a dash of tabasco and worchestershire. Let it cook on low for about 6 hours. The chicken was falling apart and very flavorful! I removed the chicken whisked the sauce just to blend the cream cheese and thickened it to use over the chicken and pasta I prepared to go with it!",
