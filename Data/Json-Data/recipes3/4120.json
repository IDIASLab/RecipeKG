I was worried about the cayenne making this too spicy so I cut it in half - although I later found that by using mild chili = it covers it up pretty well and next time I may use the full amt. I used mild chili (one can w/ beans one can w/out making 30oz total). THIS MAKES ALOT!! My boyfriend came home for lunch and wondered who all I was cooking for:)!! Finally I added some cheese to melt over my serving but my boyfriend and daughter liked it as it was. NOTE: I think this could use an 8oz can of tomato sauce to ensure that this doesn't get dried out! Leftovers were pretty dry - some tom. sauce might remedy that but overall - a tasty & easy - great when your in a time crunch for lunch.",
