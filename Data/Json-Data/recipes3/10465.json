        "description": "Pretty much all pancake recipes use baking soda, which does give them a distinctive taste, plus they are usually good only fresh off the griddle. For a new type of pancakes, try this recipe that uses yeast instead of bicarbonate. It takes a bit longer to get the batter ready. Ever since my mother, who is from Romania, said 'Why do you add bicarbonate in this? Let me make my good old recipe with yeast!', we abandoned the other recipes and the kids only want this type of pancakes. One could see this as a combination between a pancake, a crepe, or a naan bread.",

At first, I was a little overwhelmed with the large amount of batter, but they fry up super fast and in no time you\u2019re done.  They will be excellent to freeze leftovers for another meal.  Will definitely make these again!!",

If I make them for dinner I let the batter rest between 1-2 hours considering this is on the weekday. NOTE. my husband likes a thinner pancake I whisk in between 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water orange or Apple juice just before using. I also add in 1 Tablespoon of sugar... I didn't have vanilla during one use so I substituted 1 Tablespoon of maple syrup (it use just as delicious. I also melted some butter and used a pastry brush and brushed the pan with it before my first pancake. It worked quite well",
