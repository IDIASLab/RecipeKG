Saltimbocca mean jumps in the mouth and this recipe was ok. This was a basic recipe and was tasty. Different regions of Italy use different recipes and I usually dredge the chicken in flour after wrapping it with the sage & procuitto then I finish the dish off with a squeeze of lemon juice. This just gives it an extra layer of flavor. Generally this is served over spinach or escarole with a nice piece of crusty bread to sop up the sauce. Overall a good dish.",
