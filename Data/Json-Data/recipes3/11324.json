I subbed tomato soup (made it too sweet) since that's what I had and cut the potatoes very small but forgot to cook them separately first. It ultimately still turned out good but not photo worthy. We will try it again soon! I hope to convince the wife that the mushroom soup won't be too bad in the dish.:)",
