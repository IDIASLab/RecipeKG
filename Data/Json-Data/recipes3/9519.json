I bought honeycrisp apples and I cored and diced them, but left the healthy skin on.  This added nutrients and color!  I also omitted the salt and pepper and added 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the olive oil. I let them roast for 30 minutes as I like them browned a little bit.  And when I added the raisins and walnuts I also added about 1/2 oz of crumbled feta cheese for just a slight zip.  I then divided it into individual serving dishes to pack for my lunches.  This will be a staple in my diet for sure!",
