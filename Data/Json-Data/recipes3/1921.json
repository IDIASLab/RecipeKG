And I still cut down the cheese to 1/2 pound and the sauce amout was perfect. We will be making this again!!",

Mix all together with condensed mushroom soup instead of chicken and at least 12oz. cooked spaghetti noodles. Cheese and rotel amounts are still the same. The best way to cook I have found however is to combine all and then bake in 350 oven for 30 minutes. Salt and pepper on top. Delicious. A great recipe I have always loved with these simple changes.",

The tomatoes and green chiles were a problem for the children, but overall everyone enjoyed the dish.  I did choose to place in a casserole and heat in the oven to melt the cheese thoroughly. I served with candied baby carrots, italian green beans, mashed potatoes, and frence bread with garlic spread.  I was very pleased with this recipe.",
