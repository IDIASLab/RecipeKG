I am not sure why some of the people who reviewed this recipe said it was bland because it wasn't at all. The only difference that I did was how I assembled it. I cut the sprouts up first and put them in the bottom of the dish. I then put the apples on top and mixed the remaining ingredients together and poured them over top of the sprouts and apples as a sauce. Put in the oven and bake as directed. Enjoy!!!",
