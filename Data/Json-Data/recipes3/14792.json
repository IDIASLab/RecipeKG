                "reviewBody": "This was delicious once I tweaked it, but as written it was incredibly bland and dry. The 1 teaspoon of low-sodium soy sauce is not nearly enough to flavor a huge pan of food - it was undetectable.  My initial thought was to rate this 3 stars, but I noticed the recipe submitter's original version states \"soy sauce, to taste\", and I'm pretty sure they intended on way more than 1 teaspoon. I ended up using 1/4 cup, and even sprinkled in a bit of salt. That did the trick and really brought out the flavor of the mushrooms and chicken. I also used more chile paste, since I like a bit of heat. I loved the choice of mushrooms used. Regular white mushrooms just wouldn't have the same depth of flavor and umami, so try and use the shiitake and maitake if you can. I found them in an Asian market.  I do have to mention this makes A LOT - easily 4 servings, especially if you are serving it over rice.",
