I used 3 Tbsp. honey instead of 2 tsp.  And I added 1/2 tsp. each vanilla and almond extracts.  Then I used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour with the 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour.  I ended up with a sticky dough, so added more of each flour.  The cookies came out puffy and YUMMY!  Just enough sweet to satisfy my daughter, and I thougt they were great!  My daughter likes to roll and decorate cookies, but I don't want sweets too often, so these are a great compromise.  You could decorate them with colored peanut butter or Nutella.  For breakfast, my daughter dunked her name (we have letter cutters) in syrup and icing left over from some Dunkables.  We thought these were really fantastic!",

We used playdoh cutters to cut the dough. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to help with the flavor and added about 1/4 cup more flour. They still didn't have all that much taste but the girls had fun making them. I also made them thicker. So I had the oven at 350 and cooked for about 8-10 min. otherwise the bottoms were burned and the top wasn't cooked. Thanks for the great recipe!",
