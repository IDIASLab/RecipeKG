This is a recipe that I made up by modifying the popular spinach dip a few years ago it was successful with the people that I served it to so I thought that I would publish the recipe on this website. This recipe can be varied so much using ingredients that you like the most. I use either cream cheese or the 1/3 less fat cream cheese or sometimes a mixture of both and have had great results. I also have sometimes varied the shredded cheese depending on my mood ( I have used cheddar and co-jack with great results as well) I usually use Knorr's Vegetable soup packet (so whatever size that comes in is what I use) I also generally use pecans when I make it. (When I sent the recipe in for publishing I wasn't specific enough...I just said 1/2 cup chopped nuts...pecans walnuts or even toasted slivered almonds might work.) Like I said this is the type of recipe that you can vary the ingredients to come up with something that is entirely your own...that is the great thing about cooking!",

I used reduced fat cream cheese Hellman's light mayo and reduced fat Cheddar cheese so it was light on the waistline as well...but you could never tell by the taste! I also used Knorr vegetable soup mix and you could easily sub green onions for the water chestnuts. I served this with Roasted Vegetable Ritz Crackers and it was gone in no time!

Took it to a Christmas potluck at work and people oooohed and aaaaahed and then devoured it. The parsley flakes actually added a nice spicy touch. I've made it for various other occasions and in other shapes most notably a fish for a Pisces b/day. I do add a small amount of chopped scallion just because I like the taste but I've omitted it too when I know people don't care for it. A fantastic recipe...thanks so much for posting.",

I couldn't find a.4 vegetable soup mix and I used a Lipton's Vegetable soup mix (they were out of Knorrs) and it was 1 oz. I think a.4 would not have been enough. I served with a variety of crackers and my guests gobbled it up. Actually I made two smaller balls instead of one large and I think that worked out better. In my opinion way more than 8 servings. I guess it depends on how much each person eats. I also used the \"1/3 less fat\" cream cheese. I was a little leary of the walnuts but they were excellent with the other flavors. Thanks for sharing. I will definitely make again.",

I moulded the igloo out of it, spread a thin layer of sour cream to camouflage the spinach and help the parmesan adhere to the igloo, then I made some small Christmas trees out of the cheese ball recipe for the background, just coated them in dill and dusted them with parmesan as well!\nMy husband is a HUGE fan of the bread bowl filled with Knorr spinach dip and he LOVED this even better! I always have at least half the bread bowl left over. This year I made a double batch of this wonderful stuff and it was GONE! \nGuests said they recognized the spinach dip but this was a better tasting version!",
