They were good but I tweeked it by adding 1/4 tsp garlic powder let the log chill overnight sliced them then gave each cracker a dash of hot sauce before baking. They were delish!! While serving them to friends some topped it with a grilled shrimp great combination!!",

I tasted the dough and thought it needed a little kick so replaced the salt with 1/2 teaspoon garlic parsley salt and a few twists on the crushed red pepper grinder. Then I sprinkled the cracker tops with just a touch of sea salt and popped them in the oven. I guess know your audience because I came home from my party with an empty plate I think they licked it for crumbs! Btw slicing was aided by using a sharp knife and dipping in warm water between every few slices. (; These would also be good sprinkled with dill or savory or any spice you love with your bleu cheese.",
