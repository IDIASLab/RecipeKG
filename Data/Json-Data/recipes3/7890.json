I didn't have pickles on hand so I didn't add those in, but typically I'll use Dill (Polish) pickles since those are my favorite. Another addition that works great if you have it is cooked ham, cubed, and scallions. I used a can of peas, drained. I also used fresh carrots, boiled them, and then cubed them (as much as one can cube carrots, really). Since I'm trying to avoid starches, I cut down significantly on the potatoes, doing only about three large potatoes.",

They are usually imported from Israel, or they are noted as Israeli-style.  These pickles can be found in the international or Kosher sections of many supermarkets.  You may also be able to find them in the refrigerated section, where hummus is sold (Sabra brand).  These pickles don't have much of a vinegary bite to them, hence the amount of mustard called for in the recipe.",
