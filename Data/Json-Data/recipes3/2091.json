                "reviewBody": "It's a great recipe with some modifications.\n\nAn Italian friend of mine who cooks told me that the proper way to make smooth Carbonara sauce is to combine the beaten eggs with the grated parmesan, and then to pour that mixture onto the spaghetti once the spaghetti has cooled slightly (so that it's still hot, but so that the eggs don't cook and the cheese melts seamlessly into the eggs and pasta). I tried that, and the sauce was unbelievably creamy!\n\nA few other changes I made - I used less pasta, pancetta instead of bacon, and grated a brick of fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano for a sharper flavour - so that was about 3 cups of grated cheese instead of 1 cup. The final product was full of flavour and my guests wanted seconds - and no need to add salt. I didn't use wine because I didn't have any at the moment, but next time I will - it will probably add some interesting dimension.\n\nAlso tips on reheating in microwave - if it's on a high setting, it will cook the egg and the pasta will solidify. I reheat mine on medium heat so the sauce stays creamy.",

This recipe is a home adaptation of one from Angeli Restaurant in Los Angeles (where I was pastry chef for four years).  The original recipe used cured, unsmoked Italian pancetta bacon (which is delicious if you can find it).  Myself, I use applewood smoked American bacon, and usually double the amount in the recipe.  All your suggestions (adding cream, peas, mushrooms, etc., or omitting things) are great, because cooking should constantly evolve, depending on the cook.  Please continue to let your personal tastes be your guide!",

I've never found a recipe online that I thought approached my own version, til now.  But (you were waiting for that). . .someone asked for something different.  Three things I do different:  bacon, cream, and nutmeg.  I do half-bacon, half ground mild italian sausage, and set it all aside for later.  When doing the \"quick combine\" at the end, I add about 3/4 cup heavy cream, at room temp.  And to finish it, about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  Overall, it richens it quite a bit, adds to the fat content (no kidding?), but \"warms up\" the flavor in a really rich, winter-night sort of way.  Thanks for this terrific (and correct) version of this recipe, Sandy.",

It's darn good, which is really the only thing that matters. Traditionally this is made with pancetta (an Italian style bacon) but I actually prefer it this way, with regular ol' bacon! Just one suggestion--to ensure a creamy, silky sauce, mix the cheese and beaten eggs together before stirring into the pasta, off heat. Really nothing else to fiddle with or change here, because this is just delicious stuff!",

I used a teaspoon of Mrs. Dash mixed in with the eggs.  Great aroma to the dish.\nTo combat the dryness, load up on the olive oil and squeeze in 1/2 a lemon into the mixture.  \nFresh basil works wonders for all you folks looking for that \"zing\" or feel that the pasta was lacking or missing something.  Overall, not bad, but few modifications to suit your taste.  But I agree to all out there that used less pasta in the dish.  The mixture of the flavors has a very soft taste and with the right porportion of pasta would make it even more flavorful.\nBest of luck to all.  Keep sending those ideas!",
