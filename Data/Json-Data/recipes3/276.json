A little too much of the marscapone mixture for me- I would have cut amount by 1/2 to 2/3 and only layered it with two layers of the lady fingers. Also like everyone else pointed out you need about 3/2 as much strawberries for the slice layer and top. The larger pieces make for nice texture- glad I read reviews. The espresso added a lovely flavor to the fingers. Only thing I would now have added would be to put some nice large shavings of dark chocolate on top in addition to cocoa powder. For added wow- a few twirls of edible gold.",

The flavor was amazing and the presentation alone looks beautiful. There may be a problem with the number of strawberries called for in the puree but still having enough remaining for the layering / garnish. I recommend setting aside 5 or 6 strawberries to use in the layering / garnish and using the rest for the puree. I highly recommend this recipe and look forward to making it for guests in the future.",

I finished it off as stated in the recipe with the whipped cream and sliced strawberries. For a finishing touch I melted some semi-sweet chocolate added a little bit if almond extract and drizzled the warm chocolate over the tops of the dessert. Delish recipe!",
