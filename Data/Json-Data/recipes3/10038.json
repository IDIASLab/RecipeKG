I took someone elses suggestion and mixed the spices in a separate bowl and sprinkled directly onto the chicken after dreading in the milk mixture.  (I added 1 TBSP of corn meal to the milk & flour...made it a little thicker)  Also, to the spices, I added 1/4 tsp onion powder, and a tsp of sugar to sweeten it up a bit!  Be sure to REALLY crunch up the Corn Flakes too, I even poured the remainder of the flakes on the chicken before popping in the oven.  I had REALLY huge bone in chicken breasts, (which I removed the skin), and an hour at 375 was perfect! Chicken was juicy and flakes were perfectly golden brown!!  Yummy.. Will add to our monthly rotation!!! Great with mashed potatoes, corn and corn bread....",

I recommend putting the seasoning on the chicken then putting it in the milk mixture then cornflakes or after dipping it in the milk mixture add extra seasoning directly on chicken. I also did not use chicken breast but drumsticks. Overall it was good and if you're not using chicken breasts I recommend adding an extra 15 minutes baking time to get the corn flakes to be crispy on the chicken skin.",
