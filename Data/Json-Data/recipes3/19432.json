Working with 1 chilled ball of dough at a time will make rolling easier. On a floured surface roll the dough out thin (1/8\" to 1/4\") cut out 2-1/2\" rounds of dough. Place a scant teaspoonful of filling (such as Solo brand) fruit nut poppy seed etc. down the center. Fold the sides up and over the filling overlapping the dough and pinching together to keep the dough from unfolding during baking. Bake on parchment lined cookie sheets in a 350 degree oven 12 to 14 min. or until light golden brown. You can avoid rolling out the dough by pressing small balls of dough into the bottom and halfway up the sides of a mini muffin tin; and then place the filling in the middle. When baked cool completely on a wire rack and dust with powdered sugar. NOTE: Since there is no sugar in the dough you can even use savory fillings of cheeses vegetables or meats for great appetizers.",

However I made my own apple pie filling brushed these with an egg wash and sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar before baking. Then I made a glaze using confectioners sugar and milk and poured it over top once they were cool. My husband loved them saying they were like apple turnovers. Next time I'm going to add a little sugar and vanilla to the dough though to make them a little more flavorful. Also the dough becomes soft and doughy instead of staying flaky if these aren't eaten right away.",

The thin pocket dough is very hard to achieve without a rolling pin. I made a few pockets as directed but I was actually very pleased with the fruit tart conversion by accident! I used raspberry preserves canned peaches fresh blueberries and raspberries for my filling. I have included pictures of both! Cheers!",
