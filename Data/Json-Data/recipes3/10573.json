I will say that I wanted a \"pie\" recipe because I already had a pie crust to fill, so I didn't make the individual samosas, but I followed the recipe for the filling almost to the letter (didn't have peas, so used a can of corn, and used a full pound of ground beef). The flavor was amazing! Not too spicy, just the right amount of sweetness. I used a frozen pie crust, thawed out, then topped it with a refrigerated pie crust, brushed with the egg wash indicated here. I got rave reviews from my boyfriend - a staunch traditional meat pie guy - and my two adult children, one of which is a big fan of curry and samosas, in particular. I will make this again, next time trying with individual crusts. It was easy, you must try this, even if you think you don't like this kind of food.",

I loved the recipe but I feel like using beef is a kick against Indians being that the vast majority are anti-beef and this is supposed to be an Indian dish. That said we used the same amount of meat but used lamb (100 times better than beef anyways!). I also wanted to attempt a gluten-free version but the dough was not capable of folding over nicely. Thus I made a lamb samosa pie thanks to this recipe and it was amazing! Simmering all the excess liquid out as much as possible made all the difference. (I've posted the image for those interested.) This was a huge hit with my family we're Indian and I had a ton of people jealous it looked and tasted so amazing. Loved it. Thank you!",
