I followed the recipe but added 1 packet of onion soup (left out the spring onions) and added some thyme and basil. I used fresh pineapple. I nuked the cubed potatoes for 1 minute. I baked everything for 40 minutes then turned off the stove and left it in there for a tad about 10 minutes just to make sure the potatoes were done. What a heavenly smell. I will make this again.
