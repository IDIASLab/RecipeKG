I just happened to have king crab legs in the freezer which I thawed removed the meat and saved the shells to cook in the sauce. (which by the way gave the sauce an amazing flavor) Definitely did not see the need to even use butter let alone that much of it. I simply sauteed onion fresh garlic (no salt) paprika and red bell pepper in a bit of olive oil added two cans of diced tomatoes along with the legs and let it simmer. Once done I added in the crab meat just long enough to heat thru. I decreased the amount of red pepper flakes but they really added just the right amount of spice to the dish. Thanks so much!",

I did make a few changes; I used half the pasta (just 2 for dinner) fresh garlic (3 cloves) and only 2 TBSP of butter (and the red pepper flakes to taste - ie. definitely less then 1 1/2 TBSP!). We loved it made like this but the sauce wasn't necessarily saucy I don't know what it would have been like if I had used the recipes pasta amount. I did add about 1/4 cup of reserved pasta water when adding the crab tomato mixture to the pasta. Sprinkled a bit of parm cheese over the top. Delicious.",
