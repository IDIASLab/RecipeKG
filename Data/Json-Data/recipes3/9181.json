I ended up using a half cup sour cream instead of 1 tbs mayonnaise, and it was the perfect amount of sauce.  I recommend upping the mayonnaise and adding a little less vegetable.  I ended up with 10 overflowing wraps, and I didn't use the whole head of lettuce or the entire second tomato.  I will definitely make these again, with my adjustments.",

I was not using large \"beefsteak\" tomatoes, but instead the smaller plum tomato. I left out the green pepper because I am not a fan. I considered adding celery instead for some crunch. I will try that the next time. Then I just used straight mayo for the spread. Between the mayo and the tomato, I had no problems with it being dry. Yes, it is basically just a salad on a tortilla, but it was different and an easy way for me to get the kids to eat salad. I also plan to use some shredded cheddar cheese the next time as well.",
