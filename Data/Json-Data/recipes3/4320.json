Served it with angel hair pasta tossed with butter and pepper french bread as suggested steamed mixed vegetables and a fresh tossed salad. I will definately make this dish again.",

To make everyone happy I've slowly altered it from the original recipe. To start I thicken up the sauce as well as add a ton of much-needed flavor by adding a can of garlic-seasoned cream of mushroom soup to the creme before adding the chicken. I also season the chicken with garlic poweder. I have added various vegetables -depending on my mood. This is a definate picky eater pleaser.",
