The other reviewers are right, the cheese to noodle ratio is way off. The mouse likes her cheese a little too much! The macaroni has to be doubled to 3 cups, and I found it does best in a roomy 2 or 2.5 quart casserole dish.\r\n\r\nSince I'm not a huge fan of so much velveeta and processed cheeses, I went out in search of the perfect blend and found Kraft's \"Classic Melts\" shredded cheese blend. It's a combo of American cheese, sharp cheddar, white cheddar, and monterey jack. I got two of the 8 oz. bags.\r\n\r\nI am pregnant, and this is my all-time #1 craving. Better than the Cracker Barrel's Mac & Cheese. :)",

This is perfect just as is, as the pasta will absorb the \"soupiness\" either as it sets or as it bakes.  Unless you want a gelatinous wad of pasty macaroni, \"don't use more macaroni.\"  This is classic macaroni and cheese just as it should be - creamy and cheesey and just plain comfort food good, with no sharp cheeses or extra,  distracting spices or seasonings.  I prepared this exactly as written, right down to the seasoned bread crumbs - for that I just crushed some herb crostini toasts. I can't see a mac and cheese recipe that could possibly be any better than this one. ",

The first time that I made it I thought that there was too little macaroni, but after it baked, it was absolutely perfect.  I have also made this using 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 american cheese and it was wonderful as well.  I would suggest if making changes to still use 1/2 processed cheese like velveeta or american, as it lends to the creaminess of the sauce since it melts so well and doesn't separate like real cheeses such as cheddar, but I love using 1/2 sharp cheddar for flavor.  This is my now standard recipe.",

Baking dries out the sauce as it is absorbed in the macaroni.  Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup cream or milk (skim is ok) to make sure the consistency is very creamy and liquid prior to placing in the oven to bake.  The bread crumbs are not necessary; a sprinkling of paprika for color does just fine.  I also grate a little onion for flavor, use white pepper (and this recipe is rather bland without it) and use a variety of cheeses such as a good quality cheddar (love Hoffman's extra sharp - ultra smooth, yet ultra tasty), asiago, american, a bit of parmesan.  Whatever your particular palate grooves to.  If you love an ultra creamy, cheesy mac and cheese, skip the baking and dig in!!",

I've tried dozens of other people's homemade recipes over the years and every single one is bland in comparison.  You MUST use 2 Tablespoons of MINCED onion (vidalia or another sweet onion is BEST to use for this, regular yellow or white makes it too strong) and cook the onion in the butter until soft then add the flour.  I also only use 1 Tablespoon of flour.  It thickens wonderfully in oven.  You also need to use 1/2 teaspoon of salt (add to onions and butter with the pepper), even though the cheese is salty, it will make it perfect!  I also use 8 oz velveeta and 8 oz shredded classic melts cheese by kraft.  I promise you won't be disappointed!",
