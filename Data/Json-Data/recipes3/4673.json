I omitted the parsley as I am not a big parsley fan but think it would be fine with it included. The onion would be better sauteed first so it would not be crunchy in the final baked dish. Also as for the grease another reviewer mentioned just remove the meat from the pan and set on a cooling rack to cool and to drain any grease. I would make again with the above modifications and maybe add some bread crumbs to keep the meat from being so dense.",
