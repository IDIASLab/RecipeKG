I did not have fresh lemon so I added California Lemon Peel (McCormick) in the seasonig mix along with some Zesty Lemon (Weber). Before baking I sprinkled additional Lemon Peel on top. We had Mackerel steaks (instead of fillet) so cooking time was a bit longer and I did flip the steaks for an additional 5 minutes to complete cooking throughout. They came out moist & flaky and very delicious.",

My only problem was that I could not get the fish to cook completely under the lemon.

I broiled the fish for 6 minutes and it came out perfect! Served with (among other things) plain rice and the flavour of the fish was really taken up by the rice perfectly.",
