This is obviously more time consuming than just opening up a bag of frozen ones but these are fun to make and you  can control what spices go into them. I plan to play around with the flavors and even make spicy tots. I froze half of the batch to use at a later date and I am going to try baking them in the oven for a healthier alternative. I will update my review once I do.",
