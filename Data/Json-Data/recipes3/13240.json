We were going to freeze left overs since it says they freeze well, but they were to good to get them into the freezer.  He'll take to work IF there are leftovers after dinner tonight.  It doesn't say how to warm up if they would've, but probably would've tried to microwave them. I would like him to try using 2 oz of cheddar cheese next time though.  The fontina cheese makes them creamy tasting. Since we were short on fontina while he was at the store getting more, I had to watched the potatoes. I shut them off & drained but I think they might've cooked to long from residual heat which is our mistake. Will make again when we're sure we have enough fontina cheese in the house.",
