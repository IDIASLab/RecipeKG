There was another Mexican Corn Chowder recipe on this website that had a lot more reviews but it used half & half and 2 cups of cheese so I chose this one instead because it's ingredients were healthier. I made a few changes: 1. omitted the celery 2. added about 1/4 cup green pepper when I sauteed the onions and carrots 3. used fresh oregano instead of dried b/c I had it on hand 4. added one can of creamed corn and used frozen corn kernels to make up the difference to get to the 3 1/2 cups 5. only used one cup of milk 6.I didn't have a chile pepper on hand so I added some hot sauce and red pepper flakes to taste. Overall this was a really great recipe. I laid out shredded cheese diced red onion tomatoes and cilantro as toppers and served with tortilla chips. I served it with a baked potato and it made the perfect dinner. I will definitely make this again. Update: I've made this again without the creamed corn alteration and I don't recommend that. The creamed corn helps thicken the soup. Otherwise take the other advice and use some flour to thicken. Overall still versatile enough to doctor up to your preferences.",

I used veggie broth instead of chicken and celery flakes instead of regular celery because that's what I had. I added some green pepper and did a full 6 oz. can of green chiles. I added a touch more oregano and some chili powder and cayenne pepper. However I only needed 1 cup of milk. I don't know if it was because I used the creamed corn but 1 cup of milk was definitely enough. Overall this was tasty and I'm sure I will make it again. Went together quickly.",
