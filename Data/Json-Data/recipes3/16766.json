This recipe is very flexible. Feel free to use any type of bread or cheese you have on hand, and add or remove vegetables to suit your preferences. I recommend serving with fruit for a nice balanced breakfast! Don't worry if the recipe makes too much, just reheat in the microwave; it's still good for breakfast or lunch the next day.",
