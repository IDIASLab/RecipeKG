I used twice the mushrooms and after I browned the chicken I removed it from the pan and cooked the mushrooms and some shrimp and them added a little heavy whipping cream and reduced it to make a marsala cream sauce and then I added the chicken back and served it over garlic and basil fettuccine. It turned out awesome. I have work in a few 5 star restaurants and had chicken and veal marsala in a lot of restaurants and this is the closest I have gotten the dish to taste myself!!",

I made a few changes, as usual, and everyone -loved- the results.\r\n1- To make it easier to clean up, i put the flour, salt, pepper, and oregano in a resealable plastic bag, then added the pounded chicken and shook it up (one breast at a time) to coat. It's just easier and cleaner that way.\r\n2- When browning the chicken breasts, i added a few sliced cloves of garlic. mmm\r\n3- I doubled the sauce, probably trippled the mushrooms (the more the merrier, right?) and then thickened it with a slurry (water-cornstarch mixture) at the end so we could enjoy it over the angelhair pasta i served it on. So good.\r\n4- i added a splash of heavy cream and a splash of chicken broth to the sauce, to make it richer and creamier, like i'm used to Chicken Marsala being.\r\n\r\nas other users suggested, buy good Marsala wine. It's really not all that expensive, especially if you compare it to how much it costs to eat out at a nice italian restaurant. ;)",

I made it this past weekend at a dinner party for somewhere between 25-30 people and everyone loved it as does everyone I've ever made this for.  \n\nI tend to spend a little more time on prep work because I'm very picky about my chicken, and I take time to trim off as many of those little fatty pieces as possible prior to pounding it out flat.  Sometimes that one chewy bite of fat ruins a good piece of chicken for me!\n\nHere's a few things I do in addition to what the recipe says.  I mentioned I cut out any fatty pieces.  I chop up some onion and add it when I throw the mushrooms in the pan.  It doesn't 'make or break' this, but adds a nice little 'extra' when it's sauteed.  If you buy whole mushrooms and find it too tedious/time consuming to slice them with a knife ...either buy them already sliced (usually a $1.00-$2.00 more), or buy them whole and use one of those hard boiled egg slicers ...And it keeps the slicing thickness consistent.\n\nDefinitely try this recipe, you'll love it.  If it doesn't come out perfect the first time (and it will, but if you feel it didn't), don't be discouraged to try it again.",

I've also made it with and without flour, and it works either way.  Also, with a thinner sauce, you can slice up some warm French bread and use that to soak up the extra sauce on your plate-yummy and you don't even need butter!",

I added garlic powder, italian seasoning and lots of salt and pepper to the flour mixture. I cut back on the oil and butter- about 2 heaping tablespoons each.  Plus, I sauteed crushed garlic in the oil and butter before adding the chicken. It turned out great.  My stepdaughter loved it.  I served it with angel hair pasta and broccoli.  But I think I may add cream to it at the end, like one reviewer suggested, to make more 'gravy'. It needed more sauce for the pasta. All in all, this is great! (Edited 5/22/2010)",

The chicken was tender and flavor pretty good but I like the marsala dishes more from my favorite Italian restaurant. My fiance was neutral on this. I doubt I'll make it again.",
