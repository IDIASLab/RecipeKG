While I was sauteing the onions I felt like it was missing the \"smell.\" So I added 3 cloves of grated garlic and dried basil. It turned out fantastic! I can still smell my sauce now - Yummy.

I added a little bit of sugar and parsley while simmering it. It needs a little more flavor. Buttering your spagetti noodles did the trick for me. Thanks for the starter recipe!
