First I added a cup of leftover sour cream some seasoned salt and pepper to cook with the soup mixture. The next change was that I used 5 leftover frozen chicken patties that I had microwaved them and chopped them up. I added them at the end. The vegetable I used was brocolli and I did use the mozzarella cheese. My husband daughter and I all really liked this meal. I think the chicken patties actually added a lot of good flavor and that it would have been kind of bland with just regular chicken. This is so easy that I will definitely make it again!",
