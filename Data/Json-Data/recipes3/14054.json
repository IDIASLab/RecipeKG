Lobster is sweet and rich tasting on its own, so the lighter sauce makes so much sense. And what's even better, you can prep these ahead of time and just pop them in the oven when your guests arrive!",

Honestly, the consensus in the family was that we would have preferred having a simple, old-fashioned steamed lobster with butter and old bay.  No disrespect to Chef John, who I think is amazing, but this one just didn't suit our tastes.",
