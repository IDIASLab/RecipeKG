But I didn't. :)\nI do however serve this cake, and it is one No one can get enough of. I use dark chocolate chunks as opposed to chocolate chips. Try using mini bundt pans, and make sure to dust them with a little cocoa...I prefer Ghirardelli. Serve them drizzled with a liqueur, and don't be afraid to experiment with flavors...this is the kind of dessert you can cater specially to the tastes of your guests. I have used raspberry, hazelnut and creme de menthe liqueurs, all with raving success. Garnish with a couple of mint leaves and you're set. It's so easy it's ridiculous.\n\n*edit* I found these little Andes Mint mini chips at the grocer and used them in place of chocolate chips. Oh my goooood. So moist and minty, it was positively sinful!",

Used a devils food cake box, 1/4 cup Godiva and 1/4 Kamora(just like Kahlua but 1/2 the price!), and only one cup of chocolate chips (mini is best but not essential). Used cocoa to dust the pan, but you can also use a little of the chocolate cake mix if you don't have cocoa. Baked for 60mins. Had leftover chocolate ganache from a cake I made earlier in the week (that was WAY more work and not as good!) so poured that over the top, and it looked stunning! Have been experimenting with different liquors every time I make this - Baileys, Grand Marnier, dark rum...My favorite liquor in this cake so far has been Chambord (raspberry), although Grand Marnier is very good too. FYI: Tia Maria, Kahlua, Kamora and Cafe Ole are all coffee flavored liquors (the last two being the cheapest). Godiva and Creme de Cacao are good for the chocolate flavored liquors.  You could also make this non-alcoholic by using strong brewed coffee.",

Made this about 4 times and second time decreased chocolate chips to 1 cup, which is plenty sweet and taste better.  I also used 1 cup of Irish cream flavored liquer, which tastes much better and added more flavor.  Have also substituted 2 tablespoon instant espresso powder in place of the liquer and was fantastic.  Espresso really brings out the flavor of chocolate.  Have also used Andes Mint Chocolate baking chips and it was to die for!  Also, use room temp. eggs, which makes cake rise better.  (If in a pinch, soak cold eggs in  very hot tap water for 5 min.) No need for glaze or frosting or this will be too sweet.  Taste best with fresh strawberries/rasberries if available.  If not, dust with powdered sugar and you're good to go.  So easy and taste very homemade!!  **TIP - You can use other cake mix flavors, such as Vanilla, and add the sour cream to make a moist, dense yellow cake.",

I tried using one cup of chocolate chips at the suggestion of other reviewers, and it's delicious. I prefer using the full 2 cups of mini chocolate chips though. I think it lends greatly to the gooey consistancy of the cake. Regular chocolate chips look like chips in cake...the minis seem to melt right in. I have also experimented with different liquors such as Kahlua and Godiva but try others for fun too. I think it's great with Bailey's which my husband liked, but when I used my Aramula cream liqueur...he declared it the best chocolate cake in the world. It needs no icing...try a light dusting of powdered sugar for asthetics. Make sure you dust just before serving. This cake is so moist...the powdered sugar is quickly absorbed (and may look less than appealing). Also, make sure you do flour the pan or use baker's joy. Once, I only used oil and the cake didnt fall out as neatly.",

It really just tasted like a souped-up box cake... one with a little something added to it but a box cake nonetheless. I'd give it three stars but after all the ecstatic reviews I was pretty disappointed. I won't be making this again.",
