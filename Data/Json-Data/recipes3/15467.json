That way everything is ready at the same time. Secondly brown the pork for five minutes then add the diced/chopped veggies and garlic and cook 3-4 minutes altogether. Helps intensify and meld the flavor. You can replace the tomato sauce with Snap-E-Tom (or Spicy V-8) for some extra kick. PS: The red wine adds a robust flavor to the sauce; definitely keep it in. This was a great recipe; will definitely go in the rotation!",
