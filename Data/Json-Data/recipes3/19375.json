When melting the chips (I use the microwave)throw in a little shortening (I used about a tablespoon for this recipe which I converted to 42 servings). This increases the fat which helps the chocolate melt smoother stir easily and gives it a nice gloss. Some people use a little butter but since the water content in butter or margarine can be high it may make your chocolate seize! Hope this tip helps!!",

I highly recommend using a microwave to melt chocolate. If you're using chocolate chips in this recipe -theres approximately 2 and 2/3 cups of chips per pound of chocolate. I microwave darker chocolates (milk semi-sweet german) at one minute intervals on full power- stirring in between. I've found that white chocolate melts faster so use 30 second intervals for that. On this recipe I microwaved the white chocolate for two 30-second intervals stirring in between then added the peanut butter for 30 more seconds. Also I used a smaller pan than what this recipe calls for I like my TB a little thicker.",

Either way this works out just fine. Also crunchy or creamy pb is fine!! If you're not a nut person know the creamy pb tastes just as heavenly if not better than the crunchy!! I line my pan with foil since I find that easier. I have my ingredients out and each chocolate in a separate bowl to microwave ahead of time to save time! Melt the white chocolate for 1 min then add pb...then continue to melt for 10 sec. intervals until completely melted. Be sure that you've stirred for a good 15 sec. or so each time you take out of microwave. Then I melt the semi-chocolate for a minute stir for 15-20 sec and continue microwaving until completely melted. I don't bother swirling. I thought it looked prettier w/o doing it so again.. whatever is fine!:) I actually cut while it's just set but still kinda warm so it's easier or take out my chilled fudge until it's closer to room temp or you will crack the fudge while cutting instead of smooth cuts. Always have a slicing motion over and over....not a sawing one.",
