I took other reviewers advice and doubled everything except for the fennel, as I had a very large bulb from my CSA. Instead of diced tomatoes I used a 28 oz. can of peeled crushed tomatoes. Sauteed the vegetables and then dumped everything in my slow cooker and cooked on low about 8 hours, then used my immersion blender to blend. Salt and pepper to taste, and it was delicious!",

I doubled the recipe to be rid of the fennel and had no olive oil on hand (so used vegetable oil and would use less of it next time). I also could not puree to smooth the soup given that my blender leaked a little and so I was hurrying it along and had some small chunks of veggies in it but that turned out fine anyway. We served it with a bread loaf alongside grilled ham and cheese sandwiches for dinner tonight. My 13-year-old said it didn't look very red but she liked the taste of it. I agreed about the color but was not willing to add food coloring just for the sake of that. We will make this again so thanks for sharing the recipe!",
