Sour cream and onion dip keeps the meat moist and it is served with a delicious sour cream and mushroom sauce.  My family usually adds a bit of Cajun seasoning blend since we Louisianians like our food spicy.  This recipe just might change your family's mind about meatloaf!",

I found myself w/out onion soup mix for this recipe...so going through my packets I found a seasoning packet from a box of stovetop stuffing (in which I had used the bread crumbs for another recipe). This was the only change to the meatloaf recipe. WE LOVED IT! What a nice variation from having to use ketchup or tomato sauce etc. Will be a 'for sure' rotation in our dinner menus! Thanks for sharing this recipe w/us!:) The gravy was 'icing on the cake'..very creamy and yummy on mashed potatoes and the meatloaf!! Ok I'll stop gushing now lol.

The taste reminded us of a mix between Salisbury Steak and Beef Stroganoff. I left out the celery and dill weed. I also cut down the bread crumbs to about 3/4 cup. This helped to keep it from drying out. My meatloaf was done in 45 minutes. So I topped it with the sauce and baked it for another 10 minutes. I will make this again and again! Thanks TRAVLEE!:o)",

I will be making some changes next time I make this dish because the flavor of the onion dip was to. overpowering; 4 oz. of onion dip divided with 4 oz of sour cream divided. I will also be adding 1/4 cup of milk to the gravy to thin it some. Other than some tweaking this recipe is a nice change from an ordinary meatloaf.",
