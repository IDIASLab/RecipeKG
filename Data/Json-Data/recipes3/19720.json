I didn't have any apple juice so I just added a bit of brown sugar. To make this a more complete meal I removed the chops after browning and fryed up some bacon pieces. I then added my onions and garlic and then the kraut and caraway seeds along with a good bottle of beer and some chicken broth. While that was simmering I placed my chops in a casserole dish and topped them with thinly sliced potatoes. The kraut then went on top of the potatoes I covered with foil and placed it in the oven for about and hour and a half. The \"broth\" in this dish was so flavorful and the meat was extremely tender. Hubby was thrilled. Thanks so much!!!!",

It's purpose is to reduce the acidity of the sauerkraut - it's supposed to turn to mush and be not noticeable when done. Her version uses pork ribs which I've started browning first to make the color of the finished dish a lovely brown. I've also started using the caraway seeds for a subtle flavor improvement. I use the fresher 'bagged' sauerkraut found in the refrigerated food section instead of the variety in the jar and include the juice with the sauerkraut. The apple really works! We serve it over mashed potatoes. It's one of our favorite comfort foods!",
