I used turkey italian sausage and drained that then in the same pan softened the onions and garlic and added some celery (sorry just not dressing to me without it). I don't think the onion garlic and celery would of been soft enough for me just cooked in the oven for the 25 min. and nothing turns me off more than the crunch of raw onion in something like this. I left out the celery seed used pecans in lieu of walnuts and only added some orange zest. This is great and went well with my chicken.",

For example my family prefers dried cranberries to fresh and they also like dried tart cherries currants and sultanas. We sometimes sub pecans for walnuts. However I do not modify the spices. And I think it is essential that you include the fresh orange. Once I made the recipe and didn't have an orange so I used a few tablespoons of oj. The result was okay but not as interesting as the essence you get from the orange rind's oil. My favorite bread for this recipe is multi grain. Whole wheat is also good but multi grain provides a better texture. Although I enjoy white bread for some dressings I don't think it's very good for this recipe.",
