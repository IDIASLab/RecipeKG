I used instant mashed potatoes and added about 1/2 a cup of shredded cheddar cheese like other reviewers. This made my mixture very sticky and hard to work with which may have been why the batter tasted so strongly of oil. It soaked up quite a bit and we couldn't taste much of the potatoes. I also added some garlic powder onion powder salt and pepper...but couldn't taste it. Glad I gave this a try but won't make again.",

My mother handed down her recipe to me. I lost it and couldn't remember the exact measurements. This recipe jarred my memory. The only difference is that I use less salt. Also as others said you can add diced onion and/or bacon etc. to add different dimensions. I use a small cookie scoop to make hush puppy size puffs. If you make them too big they won't get done inside or else you'll have to fry them way to brown. Other than the salt this recipe is the one! Thanks for posting this. Also some reviewers mentioned the \"dough\" to be too runny or too thick. The viscosity of the raw product will depend on how thick you originally made your mashed potatoes.",
