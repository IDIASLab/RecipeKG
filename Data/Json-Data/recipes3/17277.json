I had to look up what a cross rib roast is as I couldn't find it in the store and used a boneless chuck roast. The meat was perfect flavor wise and so tender following the cook time in this recipe. No more need to buy or make condensed french onion soup for french dips because this is the recipe to make! So spot on to us! The only change I made was omitting the browning sauce because I didn't have any on hand and for only needing 1 tsp I didn't want to make it from scratch. If you're out of browning sauce and don't want to make your own I've read that a dark soy sauce or worcestershire could be used. In the end I tasted the jus and did not feel it needed anything else. At the same token my jus was not as deep/dark in color and the browning sauce would have taken care of the color and added a little extra something flavor wise but no big deal to us as this was the perfect french dip for us! Thanks for the recipe Bren!",
