I followed the recipe pretty close although I did bake my sweet potato in the microwave put in refrig and skin came off easily when I was ready to start recipe. Other than that I followed the recipe perfectly but found that it was so dry I couldn't use my Ninja blender with any success nor my Cuisinart hand blender after emptying into a bowl -- dry and too thick. Soooo I Googled and discovered that many hummus recipes add water while blending to reach desired consistency. I added an extra TBSP of lime juice added water to the garbanzo bean can to rinse and added slowly as I blended with Cuisinart until it loosened up a bit. It's beautiful it's tastes great and I would make it again. Next time I will not drain the beans and I think that might solve my dilemma. Love that it made such a large batch.",
