I found l/4 c. flour added after you fry the onions and beef and continue to fry for about 3 min. (stirring constantly) will remove the raw flour taste in the finished product. Also, I heat the milk and add it a little at a time for desired consistentcy. The hot milk helps eliminate the \"lumps\" in the gravy. We like this over mashed potatoes.I also add some fresh garlic chopped to the onions.....pretty good.",

You can help boost the flavor a lot by adding Worchesteshire sauce and seasoned salt to the beef/onions while browning and then adding more seasoned salt to taste once the gravy thickens. Last time we added chopped green pepper to the beef/onion mix and it added some freshness - you can also use unfrozen peas instead of canned for fresher taste. The gravy does take a while to thicken but it's worth the wait - just keep stirring over med heat. Thanks for posting this - it's an easy meal that makes great leftovers!",
