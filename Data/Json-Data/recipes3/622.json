After covering the cheese with the dough I opened another pkg. of crescent rolls and made a beautiful leaf design on top. Glazed with milk instead of egg (more shiny) and received RAVE REVIEWS!!!",

I used fresh dill and was very generous with it. I also used garlic powder and that gave it a good kick. Make sure you seal it well. Mine came open but the cheese didn't leak out so it was ok. The best part about this recipe is that the options are endless. Next time I think I will put lox in the middle of the cream cheese and dill on the outside.",
