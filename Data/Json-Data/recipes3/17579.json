Substituted 2 cans  northern beans, fire roasted diced tomatoes with green chilis , 1 tsp dried thyme ,about 3 cups frozen spinach/kale mix  and a small amount of broken up  pappardelle egg noodles. Left out lemon zest and crushed red pepper.  Next time  Did not use the 1 TBS oil to brown sausage.  The grease from meat is plenty enough to saute the onions and garlic.  Easy  to make.  Just throw everything in a pot and let it simmer.",
