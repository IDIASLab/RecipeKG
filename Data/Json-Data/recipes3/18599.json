As soon as I saw this recipe I went right to the kitchen to make it. I will say I will from this point on always use mayonnaise instead of butter. Honestly using the mayonnaise instead of butter tasted amazing and wasn t as greasy. I used Havarti cheese because it is my favorite and American cheese. I made one for my daughter but I didn t tell her are used mayonnaise instead of butter and she didn t even know the difference. This is how I will make my grilled cheese from now on!! Thank you so much for this recipe.",
