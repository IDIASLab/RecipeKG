Recipe says it serves 6 but this was just about the right amount for hubby and I so keep that in mind. These were good but who doesn't love a classic wing? I recommend making as is to start off and only add more butter to the sauce if you see fit. I'm already looking forward to making these again!",

It was way more flour than I needed for 4 legs but I've put the rest in the freezer for next time. I used a wok to cook in and didn't measure how much canola oil I used - probably 3 cups maybe 4. Since the legs were obviously bigger than wings I cooked them for 10-12 minutes turning them a couple times. The chicken was juicy and flavorful with a nice crunchy coat. The Texas Pete wing sauce with butter (which I heated in the microwave) gave a nice kick but not enough to hurt. Good recipe!",
