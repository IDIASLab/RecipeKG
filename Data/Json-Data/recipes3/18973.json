I haven\u2019t made any Tai food and this recipe not only doesn\u2019t disappoint, but it has awakened me to a new type of food to experiment with. This is a very simple recipe to make, but the flavors are very complex. For me, I would leave out the tomatoes because they don\u2019t add anything essential to the recipe. In the recipe, the basil was only added at the end...so I added a bit towards the end of cooking and then used more as a garnish. I mean, 1/2 cup of basil and you can do a lot of things! Also, possibly make up extra sauce just in case  anyone wants a bit more because it is super good! Thank you for a great recipe!",

I think for me that was the right choice.  The dish as shown in the photo seems to have less 'noodle to non-noodle' ratio than I ended up with.  Next time I may drop down to 8 oz of noodles instead of 12, and I may bump up the chicken to 1.5 lbs instead of 1 lb.  But I really enjoyed this, and in my opinion it was just as good as some of our local Thai restaurants!",
