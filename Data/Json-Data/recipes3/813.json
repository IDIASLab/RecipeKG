When I tried slicing the frozen roll it did crumble and so I JUST LET IT SIT ON THE COUNTER A BIT TILL IT SOFTENED UP.  IT WAS PERFECTLY EASY TO SLICE! No problem.  I found that it needed 10 to 12 minutes and the taste and texture was great. Not to sweet.  The only thing I would do different is to mix the nuts into the dough instead of around the edges. Less messy and more nuts.  This cookie is definitely worth making. Do not let the other reviews scare you!",
