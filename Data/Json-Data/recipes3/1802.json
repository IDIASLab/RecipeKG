I seasoned all sides w/salt & pepper and seared on all sides before rubbing \"juice\" mixture (not paste) all over meat before placing in crock w/wine (red & a bit of white cause that's all I had) already cooking on low. I tripled ingredients except thyme as I'm not a big fan.  I did add oregano (because I LOVE oregano w/lamb). Used stoned ground mustard w/horseradish and everything else listed. I only gave a 4* because I feel that it was not a \"paste\" but a juice and I cooked my almost 8lb roast for 3 hours on low and it was done! If I left it in longer it would have been ruined.  I added cut up potatoes and carrots into the juice while my lamb rested approx. 30 minutes then carved.  I removed some of the juice to a pot and thickened to make a gravy for lamb and veggies.  It was just AMAZING!!!  I was a bit leary as to cooking a lamb in the crock pot but it did work.  It was OH SOOOO GOOD.  Thanks for the idea.  HAPPY NEW YEAR!",

I was hoping for the best when I searched for leg of lamb in the slow cooker but am delighted that I found this,  Did exactly as written except used bottled lemon juice instead of from a fresh lemon.

Just making the potatoes and veggies now but promises to be a great dinner.",
