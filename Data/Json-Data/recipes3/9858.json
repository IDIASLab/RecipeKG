Per other suggestions I added a small can of corn and reduced the chicken stock to 2 cups (recipe calls for 3 cups). Also for the last part (where it says simmer for 30 mins) I ended up transferring it and keeping in on low in the crock pot for 30 mins, then on warm until dinner time. Very flavorful and hubby approved. Even my 1 1/2 yr old son approved! I topped it off with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. Will definitely make this again. I gave it 4 stars since I had to adjust the recipe by reducing the chicken stock from 3 cups to 2.",
