I had 1 squash on hand that needed to be used up, and a half a tube of pork sausage - so basically I cut the recipe in half, but I probably had close to the full amount of sausage. I did need to bake it for about 45 minutes after adding the stuffing, to get the sausage cooked to 165 degrees. I covered them after the first 30 minutes, as the tops were getting a little brown, and I didn't want them to burn on top. I also used craisins, as the submitter suggested, as that's what I had on hand. Thanks for the recipe!",

Used a granny smith apple because that's what I had.  Pricked the squash all over with a fork and then microwaved for a few minutes instead of baking.  It was then very easy to cut in half.  Sprinkled salt and pepper on the squash before stuffing.  Sauteed the onion, sausage and apples before stuffing.  But even though the apple pieces were quite small, they were still al dente after 50 minutes in the oven.  Next time I will saute longer.  I will make this again.  Thank you for the recipe.",

I didn\u2019t notice that it said 1 cup of pork sausage and saw the Jimmy Dean\u2019s part and ended up adding the full 16 oz container/tube. Thank goodness. There still wasn\u2019t enough. I served this with jasmine rice and it gave it an extra sweet taste. I would recommend making this into a casserole instead with chunks of squash, triple the sausage, add an extra apple, and add the jasmine rice either at the end or while cooking. I have no idea how to add it prior so I would just say add as a mix in. I won\u2019t make it again though so good luck to everyone. I also didn\u2019t care for the overpowering taste of the cloves, maybe by adding all of the extra stuff it wouldn\u2019t be as strong.",

Liberally sprinkle the poultry seasoning over the top, sprinkle the ginger but a little less...but way more than 1/8t! Do the same with salt and garlic powder, then add a few caraway seeds...skip the rest.  I saved the raisons for a topping . Spray a pan with non stick, put in the squash and fill allowing extra to fall to the sides. Lightly sprinkle with shredded Mozzarella, place in 350 oven for 20 min until cheese melts and is browned,. Cool 15 min. Serve in bowls with toppings: Golden raisons, diced onions and apples, butter on the side for the squash at the bottom of the shell.
