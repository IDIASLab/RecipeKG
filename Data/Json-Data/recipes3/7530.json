A few things:  I would start with 1 1/4 cup flour and add more as needed.  I thought this called for a lot of flour and I had to add extra liquid to the dough as it turned out crumbly.  Like my grandmother, I par-boiled the potatoes in ham broth, removed the potatoes then cooked the knefla in the broth as well.  Instead of frying in oil, I heated the butter until good and brown (med-high heat)and then fried the potatoes and knepfla.  Also, I can't resist adding the toasted bread crumbs to this dish.  I hadn't made this in years and came across this recipe by accident.  Jogged my memory.  Thanks.  By the way, I grew up in SD, 100 miles or so west of Hoven, SD.",

A couple of tips: 1) Don't ever mistake the baking powder for baking soda...the dough turns green (true story!) 2) don't put too many pieces into the water at once; they won't cook thoroughly and you'll have a runny mess. Thanks for the great recipe!",

In addition to parboiling the potatoes and frying in butter rather than oil knepfla always included chopped onions in with the noodles and potatoes. At the last minute a couple slices of bread crumbled into random medium-sized pieces were tossed into the browning ingredients. Parsley fresh or dried or dill weed (fresh is best!) were added as garnish. As most ethnic traditional dishes each woman has/had her own way of making and serving but the variations were never far from the basic recipe. This dish is hearty farm food made with love and ingenuity from a pantry far different from today's. Those living on the prairies of Russia or the US often had little more than flour potatoes salt and ingredients from their own chickens and a cow. What creativity!",
