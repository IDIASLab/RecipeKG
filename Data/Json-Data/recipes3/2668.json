I also did add 1 cup of mixed veggies (green beans carrots peas - frozen) and some crushed Ritz crackers mixed with butter on top. I cooked the noodles and did not refrigerate overnight. Great!

First I didn't have tme to let it sit overnight so I pan fried the chicken with garlic salt and pepper in EVOO. After the chicken was done I cooked the onion in the pan drippings from the chicken. I cooked the pasta according to package directions. I used a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of chicken in place of 2 cups cream of celery. I also had some half and half I needed to use up so used that in place of milk. Mixed all ingredients together and baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees until heated through and the cheese was melted.",

I used only one sm onion which I sauteed with the chicken pieces and some frozen peas. Next time I/m going to add corn instead. I also added 1/2can of frenches onions in the mixture and the rest of the can on top. Baked for only 50 min. Wonderful dish thanks Traci.",

I followed the recipe as written except I did not refrigerate and I stirred it during the cooking time because the elbow mac looked like it was getting a little crunchy on the top. My only change for next time is that I would saute the onions first because some of them were a little on the crunchy side but otherwise I would make it exactly the same.
