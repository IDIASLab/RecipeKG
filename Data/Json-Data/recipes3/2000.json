We have made them 6 times now and I think we have perfected the technique: 1. Instead of mixing all the ingredients add them one at a time and mix between each. don t forget the almond extract! It s missing from the instructions. 2. strain the cherries before you start baking so they re not super juicy. This makes them easier to roll 3. use only a tablespoon of dough per cherry. The recipe will yield about 35 cookies and they won t seem dry 4. My bake time was 20 minutes 5. instead of icing and coconut I use the maraschino juice thickened with icing sugar. Dip the cookie top in then dip it in toasted crushed almonds. Perfection!",
