I make something similar but with a Mediterranean flavor (flounder or tilapia baked in packets with kalamata olives olive oil sliced tomatoes sliced lemons herbs feta etc.) and it always comes out tender and flavorful. The tuna packets were not as successful. I omitted the pineapple chunks as my family simply don't care for baked pineapple) and I used fresh veggies (carrot matchsticks sliced sugar snaps mushrooms). The teriyaki marinade made everything taste good but the texture of the tuna (baked/steamed) was not to our liking. It emerged tougher and drier on the inside than we like -- in fact it was rubbery. I used beautiful fresh tuna steaks so I'm thinking tuna is not a fish that lends itself to this mode of cooking. Perhaps as with my Plaki recipe a thiner more delicate fish would work better. And of course in that case reduce the baking time and use a slightly cooler oven.",
