There is some kick to it with the pepper so this isn't one of those recipes where you don't notice it. Just a warning to those who don't do spicy at all. If you eat spicy food a lot this won't phase you. I'm very impressed with the results of this recipe considering the simplicity of it. I made as written. No subs and no tweaking. Perfect as is. Why mess with a good thing.",
