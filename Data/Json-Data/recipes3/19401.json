Like another reviewer I also couldnt find rainbow-marshmellows that were \"normal\" flavored so we used the colored marshmellows that are fruit-flavored. Growing up these cookies were always brought to every church Christmas party...these are just like I remember them. I also prefer to put the marshety-choco mix in a long log down the center of a sheet of wax paper twist off the ends and secure with twisty-ties and then refrigerate overnight or for several hours before slicing them. To store them I put them in an air tight tin separating the layers with sheets of wax paper. I recommend keeping them in a cool spot to keep the chocolate nice and firm until ready to serve.",
