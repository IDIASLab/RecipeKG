I sauteed the onion in butter & added about a TBSP or a tad more of fresh garlic added the spinach & nutmeg. Then I put the fish in the dish & sprinkled onion powder cayenne pepper & salt on it. Next time I will add garlic powder & regular pepper as well. I put the spinach mixture all over the fish & baked it. When I made the sauce I added 1/4 cup of white wine to it. Next time I'll use a can of tomato sauce & double it cause there wasn't nearly enough! I think with the extra changes it could be really good & healthy dinner:-)",
