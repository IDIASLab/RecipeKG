What confused me about it however is that it was nice and thick unlike when I tried to make mashed cauliflower at home (what low-carbers love to do to substitute for mashed potates). So I asked the server about it telling him there just had to be something in there besides cauliflower! Sure enough he reluctantly admitted that there was also parsnips in there! So I was happy to find and try this recipe and review it in an effort to entice others to try it since I am its first reviewer. It is just simply delicious! I covered the cauliflower and parsnips in water in a saucepan added some fresh minced garlic brought it to a boil them simmered it until it was very tender. I drained it very well then put the pan back on the burner briefly just to dry it out. I didn't add the milk as it would have have ruined this by taking away it's substance--it needs to be good and dry and only butter added (although a little bit of cream cheese would be good too!) Finally capitalizing on the restaurant's dish I love so much I wilted some fresh arugula in a little olive oil and mixed it in at the last. Perfect! And for some reason even better than the restaurant's!",

I omitted the liquid because that would have made them even less like the texture shown in the photo but I added a good size knob of butter and then 2 tbs of 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Next time I will probably add another parsnip. I served with a nice twist of coarsely ground black pepper and we all enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing.",
