I haven't been exposed to much Indian food so I was a little weary of the combination of spices. I went ahead and followed the recipe to a \"T\" and loved it! I was pleasantly suprised how the flavors bring out the sweetness of the okra. The only thing that I would change is that when using frozen okra reduce the cooking time...it can get really mushy...I like my okra a little firm so that it holds its shape. Great recipe--thank you!",
