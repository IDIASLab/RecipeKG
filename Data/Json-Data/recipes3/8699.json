Getting it to stick to the cauliflower even before we fried it was difficult and my cauliflower was completely dry. It was too runny and greasy. Almost all the batter came off in the fryer. We tried putting the battered cauliflower in the fridge and double dipping and that only helped a little. We added more flour but that made it worse. Finally we did the simple recipe we have been doing for years and that worked great.",
