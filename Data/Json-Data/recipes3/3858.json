Since some people thought it bland I didn't measure out but rather just went heavy with garlic pepper garlic salt and parsley. I found the flavor to be great. I sliced and precooked the veggies for about 50 minutes covered with the suggested water in the pan and near the end of that time browned the lamb shoulder chops in olive oil with some rosemary. I lifted up the veggies with a spatula and slid the chops underneath to cover the bottom of the pan covered by the veggies. Added a bit more water and cooked for 30 min covered and 30 min uncovered. This is my introduction to cooking with lamb and we both love it. This recipe also works very well with thin-sliced bone-in pork shoulders should that be more to your liking.",
