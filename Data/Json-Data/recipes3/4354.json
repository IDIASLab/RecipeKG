My sister gave me this suggestion, and when I tasted the cream sauce she made for the chicken - WOW - I couldn't wait for the whole meal!  If there are any ingredients that you don't like, such as mushrooms, or artichoke, simply omit them.  It is the sauce that is the stunning aspect - and not the traditional 'canned soup' sauce!!  ENJOY!!",

I will say that the amount of flour called for is WAY too much....I made it as the recipe directed and it was not a sauce--it was paste. So I tossed out half of it and then added more half & half and some milk when I ran out of that. I think 3-4 Tbsp. would have been pleny and you could decrease the butter. Also needs plenty of salt and pepper. Other than that spectacular!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is very tasty. I lightened it up quite a bit by using fat free half and half and reduced fat butter. I also had to use the full amount of the flour even though I tried to get by with less based on what some other reviewers posted. Maybe it was because of the reduced fat ingredients I used needing a bit more bulk. Since I had some mixed color bell pepper strips to use up I sauteed those along with the mushrooms and threw in some frozen onion bits for good measure too. I omitted the artichokes although I will probably use them next time. We're not crazy about rosemary so that got left out too. I have to disagree with the poster who said this recipe was easy. Or maybe my definition of easy is different. But a recipe that requires the vegetables to be cooked first then the chicken then a sauce made separately then the whole thing baked isn't my idea of \"instant\". However I didn't mind too much because the dish tasted good and it was my day off so I had the time to devote to this recipe. However this isn't a dish I'd be able to whip up on most days after work. I served it over egg noodles with steamed asparagus on the side. A really delicious meal. I will make this one again.",

I sauteed 1 clove garlic and half an onion in 1 tbsp butter 1 tbsp olive oil. I added the 8oz of chopped mushrooms to this. Instead of just topping the dish with the mushrooms I mixed in my garlic onion mushroom mixture to the cream sauce and then poured it over the chicken. I left out the artichokes as well. The result was a wonderful flavor and a happy family. Thanks Christine!!",

Removed and cooked chicken chunks for about 5-7 min. Used 1 (14 oz) can broth.There is approximately 1 1/2 cups in can so that is what I used. Removed chicken to the same bowl as mushrooms.I used all the broth to make my sauce. I used about 1/4 cup flour and mixed it with a little half and half. Bring broth to boil and slowly add flour until desired thickness. I'm not really fond of rosemary so I used thyme leaves in it's place. Once I got sauce ingredients together I added chiken mushrooms and artichokes. Cooked to heat through. Make sure you use a non stick pan or else it will stick with all that yummy cheese in it. I served it over linguine pasta. It was so good! The sauce is great! Thanks Christine for sharing this with all of us!",
