I've made it at least a dozen times. I've substituted a teaspoon of vanilla extract for vanilla bean when necessary and it's still delicious. Personally I think the flavors are better enhanced when served with milk rather than yogurt. Besides the vanilla extract substitution I stick to the recipe exactly. Local honey is important.",

I thought uncooked kasha might be too crunchy but it was a nice addition to the granola. I am going to try not chopping it next time mostly just to save a step. I intentionally reduced the amount of honey and forgot to add the vanilla and it turned out fine. I also substitute canola oil for the coconut oil just to avoid the saturated fat in coconut oil.Thanks for expanding my granola repetoire!",
