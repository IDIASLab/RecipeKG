We got tired of most of the ways I fixed it until I found this recipe online. It has been a really big hit with everyone that tastes it. It is great for potlucks something really different! I changed it just a little I used Vegetable juice (like V8)instead of tomato juice canned diced Italian tomatoes instead of canned whole tomatoes mashed and about 1/3 cup of chopped fresh parsley instead of 2 Tbsp. Works GREAT for us! Thanks!",

I had no apple juice so used water then added a couple chopped carrots for sweetness to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. I used spicy V8 instead of plain tomato juice and since I had no fresh parsley I added some dried oregano to keep with the Italian theme. I resisted the temptation to add anything else - I was thinking maybe some beans or pasta to make it more of a hearty meal but I'm glad I did not. Ended up with a light simple yet very satisfying supper.",
