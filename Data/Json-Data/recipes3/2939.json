This is a great idea for those who aren't big fans of bread crumbs.  Also, the eggs can be taken out for a great sauce and using skim milk and fat-free cheese works well, too.  It's basically a great recipe that can be easily altered according to taste. Enjoy!",

I substituted a few shallots for the onion, and added 1 tsp. of nutmeg to the sauce. I found it slightly on the saucy side, as opposed to firm, so I think next time I will add another couple of eggs. However, the basic structure of the recipe is wonderful - it lends itself perfectly to any adaptation. I prepared it the night before and put it in the fridge, and took it out half an hour before I baked it. My guests absolutely raved over it - I served it with a brunch, but it would go well with any meal.",
