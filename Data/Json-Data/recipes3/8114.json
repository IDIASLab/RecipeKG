This dessert is not super sweet, allowing the natural sweetness of the fruit to come through. If you like sweeter desserts, double the amount of the sugar substitute or sugar. You can use whatever sugar substitute is your preference.",

I used Truvia for the sugar substitute, and although the peach-banana portion of the dessert was very good, I didn\u2019t care for the cobbler topping.  The recipe says to \u201c...pour batter,\u201d but it was so thick, I just had to drop spoonfuls on the top.  And that\u2019s OK, but I was disappointed in the taste of the topping.  Followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of using regular Georgia peaches (what I had on hand) instead of white.  Really wanted to like this, and although the recipe writer says it's good for diabetics and it may be a compromise that person's willing to make, it's doubtful I\u2019ll make again.  I\u2019m the first reviewer, so I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying, personal taste is always a factor.  SandiNicol for sharing your recipe.",

Parts of it tasted like banana bread where the topping and a banana slice were touching. The peaches were mushy and turning to sauce. There was almost not enough topping to cover the fruit.

I didn't have the same problem as the other reviewer w/ the batter being too thick. Mine seemed just like what i would expect. I used agave nectar for the sugar substitute. I only gave this 3 stars b/c I wasn't huge about the bananas. I also thought the cake topping seemed more dense than i would have liked once cooked. I will probably make this again but will do only peaches next time. I will probably also add some nutmeg and will research whether using baking soda instead of powder (or a combo of the two) will fix my issue w/ the topping.",
