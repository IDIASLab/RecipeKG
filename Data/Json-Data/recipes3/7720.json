Cut the finished pie into one-inch pieces to serve as an appetizer, rather than as an entree. Substitute sharp Cheddar for the Asiago if you prefer, and try an 8-inch square pan instead of a pie plate.  Good cold or warm.",

If you don't like peppery heat you could use mild Italian sausage instead. Didn't have Asiago so I used Parmesan. Reminded me very much of something my Mom made all the time when we were kids only she made it into calzones instead of a pie.",
