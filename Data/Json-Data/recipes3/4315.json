Switch the 4 tsp salt for 3 tsp (or even 2 if you're used to a lower salt diet) of chicken bouillon (or beef bouillon doesn't matter which though beef is better if you're subbing turkey for beef). You can always experiment with other spices in your pantry as well -- cayenne for heat cocoa for depth etc. It's a good base to tweak to your own tastes! EDIT: 7/16/10: The most valuable thing about this recipe vs. the more popular \"Taco Seasoning I\" on this site is that this recipe remembers to add flour while the other does not. Flour (or cornmeal or masa harina) helps your seasonings cook down & adhere to the meat. I use cornmeal because it also adds a good flavor but you can use whichever. Thanks again!",
