I made it in the afternoon and let it sit at room temperature until serving.   And in order to save some calories, I just salted and peppered my chicken and seared it in a little olive oil, skipping the entire breading/frying process.  My way was quick and easy and I would definitely do it that way again.  Fresh basil and a good quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar are key to this recipe.  Here\u2019s a tip:  If you think your balsamic vinegar isn\u2019t quite the quality it should be, you can add just a touch of brown sugar to it to give it more depth.",
