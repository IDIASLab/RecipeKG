I actually did skin on fillets and I took the first persons advise by swapping out the flour or Panko and swapping the egg for a mixture of butter and a little but of honey for some added sweetness. I coated the trout with Panko then brushed on my butter mixture. I just patted on the pecan blend I loaded it up. We paired this with some couscous and it was a home run. WHEN I make this again I will also add some asparagus or maybe some brusselsprouts to make this a complete the meal.",
