First off I omitted the garlic cloves and seasoned the dish with garlic powder when I salt-and-peppered it. Next I added a diced up carrot and two stalks of celery also diced to the pan at the start. I used three 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes and no tomato sauce. I added a can of rinsed Great Northern beans to the mix. I added some Tex-Mex seasoning for a little kick. I followed the first step then mixed everything except the pasta (I used large macaroni about 1.5 or 2 cups uncooked instead of bow ties) in the slow cooker. I cooked it on low for about 5 hours then added the pasta which took 20 or 25 minutes to cook. It was wet enough that I didn't need to add any water. Turned out great and reheated well. Thanks for a base recipe that's tasty and filling!",
