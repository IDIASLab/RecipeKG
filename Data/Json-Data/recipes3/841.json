I also had diced cooked chicken to use up so I added those as well. I reduced the poppy seeds to 2 teaspoons as 1/3 of a cup sounded like a lot. I added 3 tablespoons of grated cheese at the very end along with some of the pasta water and some parsely. This was better than any pasta meal I ever had in a restaurant. The best part is you can empty your fridge at the same time!~",
