I don't cover the pan, but keep sauteeing the cabbage and onions until they are very carmelized and golden brown.  It makes it sweeter.  It takes a bit longer but the flavor is fabulous.   Try this as a side to chicken, fish, or almost any type of protein.  A great change from potatoes and healthy too.",
