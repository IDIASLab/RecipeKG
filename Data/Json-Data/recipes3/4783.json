I loved this recipe as did the \"FUSSY\" people in my household who won't eat macaroni salads because of the \"too crunchy\" onion green pepper or celery found in most macaroni salad recipes. I used drained canned chicken... delicious! Think I may add a few chopped hard boiled eggs next time. And for those (like me) who like onion green pepper or celery in their Macaroni salad it can always be added to this recipe. Cooking for \"FUSSY\" eaters can be a challange... thanks Joslyn for a great recipe.",

It was even better after adding a teaspoon of dijon mustard and a little chopped fresh dill. I can definitely see myself making this again. Thanks!",
