These tasty treats are very popular in Brooklyn kosher deli and take out places. Sometimes I'll cut each one into 3 or 4 pieces before baking and serve them as a hot appetizer. Serve with a side of spicy brown mustard for dipping.",

Second there has to be errors in the quantities listed and the cooking time. 1) I used 2.5 medium onions and 6 large potatoes and there was enough filling for twice the number of knishes. 2) The squares from the puff pastries were too small to wrap around a hot dog with 1/2 cup of potatoes. 3) The dough was still soft after 15 minutes of cooking. I lost track of how many times I added 10 minutes to the timer until the pastries were crisp golden brown and flaky. 4) It took us (my son and I) two hours from start to finish.
