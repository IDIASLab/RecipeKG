The recipe uses chicken thighs, which can be browned (as dictated by the recipe) to draw out the deliciousness from the skin, or cooked within the paella mixture for a lighter flavor.

The only changes I made were using boneless, skinless thighs, then when the meat gets tender in the pressure cooker, it\u2019s easy to stir in, not worrying about the bones. \n  I tried it twice , comparing cooking the chicken on the stove in a non stick pan, and cooking it in the instant pot as directed. I felt that the chicken cooked on the stove had a better flavor, and I was able to get it more brown and then added some of the cooking juices to the rice.\nI also left out the saffron, since I didn\u2019t have any, and added a little more turmeric, tasted wonderful even without the saffron.",
