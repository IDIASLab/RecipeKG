I seasoned the pinto beans separately before adding to the bowl and heated them up -- add some garlic salt cumin and pepper. I made a sweet pulled pork today specifically for this dish but I can see how this would be also perfect for leftovers if you were using pulled pork for another dish. Really super fun dish and with guests it's perfect to have the guests build their own.",
