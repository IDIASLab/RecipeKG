The recipe does not state where to add the salt so I am assuming it was to the onions. Dipping out all of the mushrooms was time consuming. I do not see the point of dipping them out. I added them all back in the gravy in the end so if I were to make this again I'd leave them in from the beginning. Overall this was a good recipe but I do think it could be simplified some.",
