I would use a very large pepper or at least two small ones since the one we used was a little too small and would triple up on the mayonnaise/garlic sauce since the teaspoons said to use in the receipe really doesn't make that much for the big mushroom caps so we made more to spread on both the bottom and the top buns for each sandwich. Everything else was perfect. Very flavorful! Thank you for sharing the recipe! Will definitely make again:)",
