The horseradish was my \"secret ingredient\", but I didn't use as much as the recipe called for.  I served this coktel de camaron in pretty see through glasses with tostadas and saltines.

Next time I think I'll add just a bit of tequila ( I know that was in the one I had @ the rsetaurant) & maybe decrease the clamato (the clam juice in it adds lots of flavor so I won't omit it entirely) & add a bit of tomato paste to thicken things up some.

Also preparing horseradish can produce such different degrees of \"heat\" that I can't see how this can be the same each time without specifying which prepared horseradish. I made it exactly as written twice - the second time to be certain I hadn't mucked up the first time. I then made it a few more times trying different combinations and not using canned or prepared stuff like ketchup. It was a bit better to MY taste with natural products but I never managed to get a \"Wow\" taste. Maybe when I have a few more hours to experiment I will try this again but so far my 3 hours of trials have not substantially improved it.",
