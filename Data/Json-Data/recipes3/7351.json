I am a little sqeemish when it comes to fish sauces or oyster sauce, so as an FYI for anyone wondering what they could substitute the oyster sauce with:\n\n1) Look for a vegetarian \"oyster\" sauce - not a single oyster in it, but still mocks the flavor of it\n\n2) Do a mixture of one part hoisin, two parts teriyaki and 2-3 dashes of worchestire.  Some garlic and onion wouldn't hurt either if you wish\n\nFor this recipe the ratio for 1/4C (4 TBSP) would be:\n3 TBSP Teriyaki, 1 TBSP Hoisin and 2-3 dashes of worchestire\n\nI have subbed both versions in this recipe with excellent results!",

The amount of soy saucy-ness was still a lot for a homestyle dish! It was about what you would expect in a restaurant. I also cooked the meat and the veggies separately so I could control how done everything got. Good dish very easy to make especially with a food processor doing the chopping and shredding. Just cut back on the sauce or up the noodles. Would be fine with other meats or tofu instead of chicken.",

I made my own Indonesian sweet soy sauce using 2 TBS soy to 3 TBS brown sugar, boiling  it to a smooth syrup, then adding the oyster & soy sauce. I will have to make it again...and again! PS: a small 8oz of chicken breast is all that's needed to serve 3 people - sliced very thin, of course. With all the other vegetables & noodles, it was enough.
