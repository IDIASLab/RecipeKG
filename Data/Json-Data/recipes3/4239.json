At the Oktoberfest and other large festivals and in most Gasth\u00e4user in Bayern you ll find gegrillte Schweinshax n on the menu. Grilling the hocks is what makes the skin so crispy (like pork rinds). And you want to make sure they re fresh not smoked or cured. I d also recommend instead of white wine which no real Bayer would have with his Hax n a good M\u00e4rzenbier or a Doppelbock. Serve with a Semmelkn\u00f6del and some Blaukraut and you ll have an authentic bairisches Schmankerl. Prost! Brad",

My fiance thought it tasted like what he had eaten in the Czech Republic (although our pork knuckles here are apparently much smaller). I have to say that I wasn't a fan of the pork knuckle itself but if it's a type of protein you like and eat then this is a good recipe for it.",
