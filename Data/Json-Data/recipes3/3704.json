The difference is in the application, to formalise this recipe to a real crepe, use 1 Whole Egg and 1 Egg Yolk, Non-fat (skim) milk and melted butter.\nA crepe should have a carmelly taste (oil prevents this) and try to use crepe pan very hot and cook the paper thin batter for one minute and flip for thirty seconds and keep war while doing the others.I should add that it is important to sift all flour, even when it states presifted for it has solidified in the package. This is best done by holding a fine mesh sieve at least twelve inches above the bowl to provide air. Always measure after sifting. To avoid mess, do this by placing a large bowl in a clean and dry sink. When this very basic procedure is followed to the letter, then all of the subsequent ingrediant additions will benefit. Baking, like cooking is an art form and when done with love and skill, then Heaven is within reach!",

Sauce B: 8 oz. cream cheese and gradually add fruit juice (i had leftover from a fruit salad I made but any juice would work) until comes to a desired sauce consistency.

                "reviewBody": "Delicious and EASY!  This recipe has been used in my family for generations so we've learned a couple of tricks.  1. I don't believe we've ever refrigerated.  The batter's already cold from the milk so why bother?  2. Spray down the skillet with cooking oil lightly and drop just a tiny bit of butter in the center.  When the butter begins to bubble, the skillet is hot enough to start making crepes.  3. If you have any issues with crepes sticking, just spray lightly again.  Once you get going there's no need to add more oil to the skillet.  4.  The thinner the better, so try to get them as thin as you can!  5.  Flip it when it starts to look like the top is setting.  this will keep it from burning.  6. The first crepe is always a mess up.  That one should come off the skillet and immediately be eaten by you.  7. Make it your own.  It's pretty hard to mess these up so experiment (vanilla, cinnamon, brown sugar, peanut butter, etc) and just add enough milk or flour to give it the right consistency.  I've started using vanilla flavored, vitamin infused soy milk  instead of milk and I eat them with berries to make it a little healthier since I consume these pretty frequently.  ",
