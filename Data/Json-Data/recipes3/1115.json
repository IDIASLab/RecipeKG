The flavors of the peppers onion garlic and sausage infused the bread with deliciousness. The crunch from the toasted bread on top completed the total flavor. We had it for dinner with garlic butter and Parmesan asparagus and fresh garden veggies with zesty Italian dressing and cheeses I will definitely be making this again. Only thing I will change is to add a little more sausage as per my husband's request. If you like a really savory breakfast this would be the dish to use.",
