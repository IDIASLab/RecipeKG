I cut a small slit through the entire length of the tail and almost to the back of the fish, creating a nice pocket.  I stuffed the herbed goat cheese & packed it down.  I then salt & peppered the the top of the fish & made a mixture of light mayo, dijon mustard, parmesan cheese & bread crumbs.  Baked on a foiled lined baking sheet (sprayed) at 350 for approx 15+ minutes, then turned on the broiler and broiled just for a minute or 2 to get the top crust nice & brown.  WOW!  Delicious!  And incredibly easy.  Serve is with couscous and it might be the easiest & most delicious meal you'll make all week.",

I made my own blend by combining 1 tbsp each of Dijon mustard and light mayonnaise - which was plently to spread on top of the fillets. Before baking, I put more dill on the mustard-mayo topping. A definite make again. ",

A few changes I would suggest..1.)cut back on the mayo-dijon atleast by half. 2.)add back plain dijon mustard to make up for what you took away. 3.) thicker salmon works better you can make a nice hole to stuff the goat chesse in about every inch or so. 4.) put some goat chesse on top as well it well brown up just like the picture.

First, I used plain goat cheese.  I also chopped some fresh spinach and added that with the goat cheese as part of the stuffing.  I don't like mayo, and I was a little skeptical about the mustard/goat cheese combo, so I made my own sauce by whisking together juice from one lemon, 1 tbsp olive oil, and dried dill.  After stuffing the fish, I salted and peppered it and poured my sauce over it.  It came out juicy and delicious!  I plan to make this for my future in-laws when I go to visit in a few weeks.   I think they will be impressed!",

Thank you for the idea to use feta cheese - its my favorite way to prepare salmon now!:)",
