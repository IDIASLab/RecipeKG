        "description": "I spent a few days in Florence about 30 years ago, and while I don't remember much, I do recall my surprise at how delicious the Tuscan fish stew was. What I found so interesting was how herbs like oregano, sage, and rosemary, which I'd only associated with meat, were also used with seafood. Also, FYI just in case any old-school Tuscans are coming over: I hear that for this to qualify as an official Italian fish stew you need use at least 5 different types of seafood, which is both insane and adorable. Serve with crusty bread.",

It was interesting to hear the different comments regarding the meal.  Some really could not taste the flavors and felt it was too watery, personally it is exactly what I expected.  The only change I made was using 1/2 Teaspoon of anchovy paste instead of the the anchovy fillet.  I really enjoyed it but gave it four stars based on the overall comments.",
