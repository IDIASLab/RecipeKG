The only reason it might be referred to as SOS is that it is being served on toast. But true military style SOS is almost always made with chipped beef and a scant dash of nutmeg added to the other listed ingredients. As one reviewer pointed-out, the milk amount will end up being closer to 2.25 cups or more...it continues to thicken as it simmers. I usually add the entire 2.25 cups of milk initially and stir like crazy with a flat whisk to avoid lumps or scorching, hen add small amounts of water as it gets too thick during simmering. One note: when adding the 1/4 cup of self-rising flour, be sure to mix thoroughly with the cooked drained sausage and cook-out some of the raw flour taste for maybe a minute or so on med low heat (don\u2019t brown the flour though or it will changed that nice white color to more golden yellow). Also don\u2019t be timid about adding freshly ground black pepper (maybe 2 teaspoons) for true Southern Peppered Milk Gravy. Delicious!",
