However this was not even remotely \"cajun.\" It tasted more like chili than anything else. The consistency was way too thick and it tasted like chili with way too much cheddar in it. Some of you guys may like it but if you want something CAJUN do not even think about it. This was a waste of crawfish in my opinion. I'm sorry. We didn't even eat it. We are going out for dinner. Again I'm sorry. I just did not like it. Nor did anyone else in my family.",
