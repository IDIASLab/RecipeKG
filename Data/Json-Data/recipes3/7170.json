I used cornmeal rather than polenta which should be the same thing and the recipe yield was more than twice the 8 servings the recipe states.  I'm hoping for other reviews so I can see if I did something wrong.  Another thought is that the butter could probably be cut down a lot without harming the result.",

I made a trip to Aldi to pick up some Gruyere cheese just to make this recipe but they were all out (seasonal item). I pulled up Google on my phone and found that any Swiss cheese is a suitable substitution for Gruyere so I purchased a block of baby Swiss and used that. I ended up with more polenta than would fit level in the 8\" cake pan. It was slightly mounded up in the pan and I ended up shaving some of the top off once it was set so that it made for a flat surface when I turned it out onto the cutting board for slicing. Next time I will use a 9\" or 10\" springform pan. Both my husband and I agreed that the flavors are similar to the shrimp and grits that we make so we intend to use the left overs with some sauteed shrimp another night this week.",
