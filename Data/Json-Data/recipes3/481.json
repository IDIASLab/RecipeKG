Plus I don't like candy with my cake or brownies... so melting candy and using it as cheese didn't go over well... plus like other reviewers said it gets hard after it cools... so it makes it hard to cut the cake... I would just omit the \"cheese\" all together... HAMBURGERS don't have cheese on them... cheeseburgers do... and since this is a hamburger cake... no need... if you really want it... I'd think of something else... To make the lettuce easier... just get a plastic baggie green food coloring and shredded coconut put a few drops of food coloring in with some coconut and shake it up... I think coconut mixes much better with cake and icing vs some sweet candy. Anyway hope yours turns out good!",

Thanks SO much for posting this recipe!:) I think next time I make it I will try using fondant instead of candies for the toppings. Someone mentioned in their review to put crushed oreos in the chocolate frosting on the \"burger\" part of cake - that was awesome!! Really added texture! Great Idea! For the cheese I used Peachy-O's candies (i washed off sugar and microwaved to melt) then coated small square pan with cooking spray - dusted with white sugar and poured melted peachy-o's in (sugar was to keep candy from sticking again). That came out of pan nicely and square like slice of cheese. My white gumdrops for onions didn't turn out so I omitted. Will add next time when using fondant. Thanks again!",

I made this for my Dad's birthday....he's a burger freak and it got lots of laughs: ) Since it was for adults I used candied orange for the \"cheese\" and candied mint leaves for the lettuce! Thanks again!",
