Then I added a bag of frozen broccoli stir fry veggies (which not only has the broccoli but also carrots red peppers and mushrooms). I then followed the recipe per normal. The result was great! Tasted like we were eating out. Thank you Trisha for sharing this EASY and tasty dish!",

Since I'm eating solo tonight (hubby isn't feeling well and kids have a tummy virus) I'll be the only one evaluating. We usually make a dish similar to this using cauliflower and omitting the soysauce. I served this over rice rather than tossing it all together. I didn't add the scallions because I was too lazy to chop them up but didn't miss them. I used a little more soy sauce than called for. Thanks for a great recipe Trisha.",
