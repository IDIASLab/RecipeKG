There are multiple problems though; in many situations when cooking a meal you can only spend to a maximum budget - and because so many people don't appreciate seafood I found that when I spent my budget buying ingredients for this meal I didn't have enough left over to prepare a dinner for everyone that doesn't like seafood. Also the ingredients needed are hardly the type you would expect to find around the house so it is awfully frustrating having to go out and buy a great amount of ingredients that because you often have to buy in bulk you end up with a kitchen full of items you no longer have any use for. Apart from this as I said before this is very original and a classic that is probably better off staying with fancy resteraunts who can afford such frustration. An excellent treat! Brava!",

It was difficult to pummel the chicken breasts flat enough without causing them to disintegrate (I have since learned that you should place the chicken in between 2 sheets of seran before pummeling). I will make this again but next time omit the crawfish and use mushrooms and parmesan to the cream and mushroom sauce.",
