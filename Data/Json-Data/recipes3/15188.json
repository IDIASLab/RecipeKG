The only thing I might do differently is to cube the ham vs sliced. Sliced worked beautifully! But (and a small \u201cbut!\u201d) made \u201cserving\u201d a small challenge. Delicious, complex yet simple flavors! I would absolutely make again and again! Thanks Allrecipes team!!",

I layered 1/2 the potatoes, ham and leeks in the pan, followed by 1/2 the cream mixture, and repeated, followed by the cheese.  (This is how I always assemble my scalloped potato casseroles.)  Looked and smelled great out of the oven!  Let rest about 15-20 minutes, and cut into it to find about 1/2 inch of liquid at the bottom of the pan.  Everything was done perfectly, so the time and temperature are spot on.  When I make this again after Easter next year, I'll only cover the dish with foil for the 1st 20 minutes, then bake uncovered for the last 40 minutes to let that excess liquid evaporate.",
