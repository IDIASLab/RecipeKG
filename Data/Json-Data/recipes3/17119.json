Or serve plain. Very easy to make ahead and makes a great lunch! Trust your gut with seasonings; you can always add more as you go on and cooking will deepen the flavors. Curry will thicken as it cools.",

I added red bell pepper, sweet potato and stirred in some spinach with about 5 minutes left of cooking. It was incredible! I think there could have been more liquid as it does tend to cook off.  I added a can of coconut milk and still think another can would benefit the recipe greatly. I cannot wait to make this again! An easy go-to for fall and winter.",
