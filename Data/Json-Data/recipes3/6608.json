I halved the amount of meat (and used grnd turkey instead of beef), but left all the veggies at the full quantity except onions, of which I only used 2. I really cannot imagine, even if i had used 2lbs of meat, using 6 onions. Also, I didn't drain the pineapples, which were packed in juice. The light sweetness really helped to balance out the heat. I will make this again, for sure, and often.",

Fortunately there is enough left for dinner.  I had a little taste too and really like it.  I followed directions except reduced onions and omitted chili pepper and salt as I used pinto beans in chili sauce that is plenty spicy for us.  Finished it up in the crock pot because we like the onions and bell peppers pretty soft in our chili.  Also used crushed pineapple with the juice.  I think this is our new favorite chile.  Thanks.\nUPDATE:  I've made this several times since I rated it the first time and we still love it.  Last night I maded it with no ground beef and it was still great.  I did double the amount of beans to take the place of the beef. Love it, love it, love it.",
