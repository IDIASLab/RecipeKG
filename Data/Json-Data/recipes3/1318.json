We're used to drinking martinis but we all agreed that this was very strong even for us. I feel like this drink is missing some sort of mixer that would cut the alcohol a little and add some color. In addition for the Rudolph thing to work you either have to use very small martini glasses without a lot of depth or very long cinnamon sticks - and I bought the only ones at my grocery store in standard length. Therefore they barely stick up from the glass and you lose the effect.",
