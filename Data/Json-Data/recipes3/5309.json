Actually I always prepare a BIGGER london broil or roast beef specifically for this next meal. I sautee fresh sweet peppers (red green orange each all...whatever I have on hand) and onion slices in butter remove those add the thin sliced beef and just a bit of au jus to simply warm the meat. Sometimes I use a baquette I've cut down into 6\" portions other times I buy individual rolls. I slice them open careful not to slice all the way through then I scoop out the excess bread (leaving a bread shell that opens like a clamshell). I spread a thin layer of horseradish stuff it with the warmed beef top that with the sauteed onions and pepper then place a layer of cheese over the top. I've used swiss mozzarella and pepper jack - we love them all. The sandwich then goes on a baking sheet and into a medium oven for the cheese to melt and the bread to crisp (keep an eye on it it doesn't take long!) then serve with au jus. Buy the best au jus mix you can. To fancy it up substitute wine or brandy for SOME of the water.",

I tend to prefer doing this kind of sandwich on baguettes -- better stuff-to-bread ratio and well I love their crustiness. If your cheese isn't melting try leaving it out on the counter for a while so it starts at room temperature. If your slices (of any cheese) start out too cold sometimes you can have the edges altogether melted while the middles aren't even soft. Also this kind of provalone may or may not get gooey when it's melted -- that's mozzarella's job after all. This cheese should be warm and soft ideally. (Unrated because I didn't actually make this but if I DID make it I'd probably add a bit oregano.)",

We made a bit extra ajus and save a good bit of the meat and ajus to make these sandwiches. On Tuesday I sliced the remaining meat as thin as I could and added to the ajus in a pan. I let it slow simmer for about 1/2 and hour and then assembled the sandwiches as per the recipe. They came out really good and was a nice change. Will make again but probably only when we do a rib as indicated above.",
