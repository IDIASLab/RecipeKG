Thankfully b/c they were so big and chunky, we were able to fish some out when serving, especially since my daughter was like \"are there beans hiding under the tomatoes??\" The flavor profile of seasoning was right on (although my husband and I tend to add Chipotle Tabasco or Texas Pete to our bowls), but if I make this again, I would use 1 lb. meat / 1 can stewed tomato / 1 can beans.",
