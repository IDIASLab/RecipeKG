In the filling I added 2 tablespoons of cream cheese 1 tablespoon of lemon juice salt and almost the whole can of crab meat since 1/2 the can did't seem like very much. I also baked the wonton cups for about 7 minutes before I filled them to make sure they stayed crispy. I warmed the filling first then filled the cups and baked about 5-6 minutes. Scallions on top made it taste very fresh- I love this recipe and it was a perfect choice for Easter (or any other occasion!):)",
