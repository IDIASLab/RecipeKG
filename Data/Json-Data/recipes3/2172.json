This was very good but I made a few changes: added olive oil and butter to the pan sauteed the onions for about 7-8 minutes then added fresh sliced garlic sauteed it for another 5-6 minutes added the mushrooms and continued cooking the mix until the mushroom were golden brown using low heat then threw in shrimp and scallops until done. Made the sauce but used white wine 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk with the remaining ingredients added the shrimp/scallop/mushroom mixture back into the sauce and finished it with fresh parsley and tarragon. Instead of finishing it in the oven I tossed in the pasta and served it. Turned out great.",
