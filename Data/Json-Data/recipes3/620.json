This is what I came up with (1) 16 oz box of angel food cake mix and 7 oz BY WEIGHT pumpkin puree. For just a bit more spices I added 3/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and baked in an angel food tube pan. Being that I'm not a baker - yes I can read the side of the box - and nothing turns out right this was the most moist light and fluffy angel food cake I've ever tasted hands down. Even ones that I didn't make being that I'm not a baker. The pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice were spot on.",

I served it at a housewarming party; several people asked for the recipe and were surprised how simple it was to make. I frosted it with whipped cream mixed with the remaining pumpkin puree from a 19oz(?) can ginger cinnamon and nutmeg. It was even better the second day -probably because the whipped cream had moistened the cake overnight in the fridge. Next time however I think I will try a cream cheese frosting -it would probably complement the pumpkin spice flavor better than the whipped cream.",
