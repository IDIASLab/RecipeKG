This had just the right amount of spiciness for us you could taste the cayenne but it didn t overwhelm. We did the omit the liquid smoke because we don t care for it and I think we d cut back the Truvia a little next time as it was just a bit too sweet. I have a favorite BBQ sauce I ve been making for years that I clipped from the paper (Chickashaw Sauce from Jake s Ribs in Chickashaw Oklahoma) but this could be a candidate for our new favorite sauce. It s a keeper.",
