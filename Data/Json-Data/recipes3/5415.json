I then added a garlic and herb sauce and the noodles to the pan with the broccoli and shrimp and mixed the whole thing together and plated it. Lastly I added the shredded mozzarella cheese to the top and put it under the broiler for about 30-45 seconds until the cheese was melted. I think with the addition of the garlic and herb sauce it added tons of flavor but did not make it too saucey. It was great!!",

When the noodles were draining I used the same pot and used about 3/4 very low sodium chicken broth and garlic powder and dried basil (lots of both) then I threw in fresh shrimp and cooked that for a few minutes. Then I added the broccoli and noodles and put in a couple Tbsp. of Kroger's Lite Asian dressing. My daughter ate it warm and asked for seconds and she doesn't even like shrimp. My husband and I ate it cold. It was great both ways. I know I changed this recipe up but this way it was 5 stars for good quick and easy!",
