The first time I made it it was really yummy but a little too salty for my taste and also not quite as filling as I had hoped. The second time I made it I used almond milk instead of regular milk I did not add any salt I added 2-1/2 cups of chopped celery. I cooked as instructed then let it cool overnight in the refrigerator (this takes it from soupy-runny to THICK). Then in the morning I added 1 cup of frozen berries and heated it up for about 2 minutes in the microwave. One serving was 277 calories and I was stuffed! thanks for the great base recipie idea. I think I now have a new breakfast staple.",
