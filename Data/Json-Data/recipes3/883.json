I would like to suggest that you allow people to add their own dressing. We also serve the parmasean cheese on the side because people like different amounts. We found that \"Newman's Own\" Oil and Vinegar is especially well liked by most people. If you like it a bit spicier try the salad seasoning you find in the herbs & spices section as well. Also we find that halved cherry tomatoes are prettier and often have more flavor than most tomatoes we get up north. Also you can try sliced black olives for color contrast & variety. It's really a great recipe though both as suggested and with your own touches. People have varied tastes and by letting them add their own seasoning they can adjust amounts with ease. You won't have the chance to \"marinate \" but for company dieters diet-restricted and/or a husband like mine (who won't use dressing at all) it's essential!",

Right now the Family Fav is \"Whole Wheat\" pasta incuding some spaghetti broken up to look like \"worms\". (We have boys any questions? LOL) I use anything in the fridge that needs using; including- any fresh veggies ham bacon pepperoni cubed or shredded cheese (any cheese I use I add at serving time as it can become slimey). Olives in our house are a must: green or black & I use them whole (drained). Fresh onions & garlic: finely chopped & chushed respectively also. I leave the whole salad rather dry using only a small amount of olive oil & red or white wine vinegar shaken together to keep it moist. The rest of the family adds whatever Italian-type dressing they want at serving time. My preference is \"Good Seasons- Zesty Italian\" dry salad dressing mix made with balsamic vinegar & olive oil. However I've also used fat-free Italian dressing with good results but keep in mind that \"Fat-Free\" dressing absorbs/dries out quickly and should be used at serving time. Add some crumbled Feta instead of- or with the Parm. (But then again; I've never met a Feta that I don't like...);-) Oh yeah- I serve the peppers on the side becaucse I hate the damned things.",
