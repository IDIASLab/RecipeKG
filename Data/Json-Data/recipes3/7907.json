I normally cut salt in half on recipes, but with this one I ended up using 2 pinches instead of one to give the tomato and zucchini mixture more flavor. It was like a hot bland zucchini salsa. After I started it I realized the eggs were not scrambled and just directly broke onto the vegetables. That was a real turn off for me, but I decided to follow the recipe exactly. The wells kept filling up with tomato fluid not making it exactly easy or attractive. After nearly 2 1/2 times the cooking time for the eggs the whites were still half uncooked on top. I finally removed them from the heat to avoid over cooking the yellow. I didn't like the apperance of the uncooked egg whites as they flooded in with the tomato mixture either. I wished I wouldn't have wasted my good garden vegetables, as most all of it got tossed, as no one would eat it. I don't know how all of the ingredients are good, but not together? But, just thinking about this dish gives me a tummy ache with the idea of the mix of very raw liquidy eggs floating on top of bland vegetables.",
