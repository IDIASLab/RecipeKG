Don't get me wrong. These are delicious! I think i over-thought it a bit and was expecting something different. I re-read the title and it was an ah-ha moment because it is just what it says it is. a crispy fried pork cutlet. The addition of soy sauce to the egg mixture is was also a little confusing to me in that it didn't really impart any flavour even though i double the soy sauce. All in all this is a very tasty dish.",
