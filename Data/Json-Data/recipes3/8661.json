I make my own venison burger (mixed with pork and smoked bacon) to die for. Makes the best meatloaf sandwiches or subs (trust me) for work or hunting (awesome cold). Works excellent with beef too. Your friends and family will beg for more. Good thing I like to hunt (the rest of my side of family doesn't).",

I like using straight venison (vs mixing it with pork) and wrapping the loaf with 7 or 8 bacon strips to help hold it together then bake it on a broiler pan to catch all the drippings and keep even more of the fat away from the meat. Always have a warm bottle of barbecue sauce on the table for those who want some on every bite!",
