I changed it some by adding extra bacon, onion, and garlic.  I cooked the bacon and onion together, then added in the flour.  Poured some bean soup juice into the bacon onion flour mixture, then put it all in together.  I used the sour cream as a dollop before I served.  These flavors together were just what I was looking for....and believe me, they work together so well.  I appreciate so much your grandma's recipe.....even tho I changed it a little, it was truly delicious!  Even my husband said so.  Thank you.  This was exactly what I was looking for when I searched for a green bean soup...and I had all the ingredients on hand.  Totally delicious.  Thank you. :-)",

It's the roux and sour cream that make this a wonderful thick soup - goes great with rye bread!",
