We like our coffee pretty strong I set aside 1/2 cup this morning and put into the fridge. Unfortunately it was not strong enough because I could not taste any coffee in this shake so do make sure it s super strong. After blending it was pretty thin (could be my fridge ice maker cubes are smaller) so I added additional ice to get more of the shake consistency that I like. This was really quick and easy and I garnished with just a smidgen of grated chocolate. I enjoyed this shake but I still was longing for a bit more of a mocha flavor.",
