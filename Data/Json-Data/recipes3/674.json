(Not knowing whether to use salted or unsalted butter I used the \"sweet cream salted\" butter I had on hand.) I baked these for the full 11 minutes but I thought maybe another minute or two might have been better. Also my yield was only 17 cookies instead of the full \"2 dozen\" written because I tend to make cookies too big. I only have one minor complaint though. I thought there were way too many almonds to top the cookies. 3/4 cup was far too much to cover the tops of 17 cookies (maybe 1/3 cup would have been enough in my case) so I can imagine that 3/4 cup is still too much for 24 cookies. But all in all these were very tasty cookies - I managed to make them last me for 4 days instead of just 1!",
