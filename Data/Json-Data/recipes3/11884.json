I also like that you can be versatile with this dish and add other vegetables such as cabbage and carrots (which is my usual added filling). I never tried it with celery before, but it was nice added texture. There is a sauce that is usually served with it, but I normally just top it off with soy sauce/tamari (as this recipe suggests).",
