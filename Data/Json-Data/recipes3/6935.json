The soba noodles I found (had to go to a Korean grocery) called for cooking only 30 seconds so I ended up over-cooking mine but they still tasted great. The buckwheat flavor goes perfectly with the peppers and tomatoes... add in the scallops and wowsa! Highly recommended - I will make it again and probably for company.",
