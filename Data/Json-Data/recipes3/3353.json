I added 1tbl. of olive oil with the butter. 2 cloves chopped garlic. You have to add enough salt and pepper so I added 1tsp salt and1/2 tsp. pepper. At the end I poured it into a blender to puree. It came out creamy. I will not give this 5 stars as it was but I will give it 5 stars as it came out my way.",
