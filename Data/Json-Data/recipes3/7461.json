Instead of saltine crackers we add a package pf Pepperidge Farm stuffing an egg and a can of beef consume before putting it in the oven. Thanks for sharing this recipe Ron. I think I'll try the walnuts this year!",

This recipe isn't exactly the same as as it varied wildly between households though I'm sure this one is very good. My mom used salt and pepper and poultry seasoning only. She's made a huge batch. Half was for the stuffing then she amended the spices and made gorton.",
