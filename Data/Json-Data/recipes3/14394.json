It was absolutely delicious and I thought, 'What the heck, I'll try making this at home.' I found a few recipes online, but none grabbed me. After studying several recipes, I came up with this recipe on my own. It's fairly simple to make, and my wife said it was better than the original.",

I found it pretty easy to make honestly. I and my family loved it! Almost all got seconds. I honestly wouldn't change anything except the Italian seasoning. And that is only because I am not a fan of some of the spices in it. I would just add the spices I like. (thyme oregano and basil). I hope more people will try this great dish!!",
