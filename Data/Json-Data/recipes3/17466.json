I served the salad with a caramelized onion and mushroom pizza topped with feta. (before cooking the steak I caramelized one whole sweet onion sliced thin and a pound of mushrooms sliced in olive oil and butter with fresh cracked pepper and salt. I spread the caramelized mixture over a pre-made pizza crust and crumbled feta over top. Drizzled a little extra-virgin olive oil. Pre-heated oven to 450 and when ready to bake turned the broiler on to Hi. Baked in the oven while steak was resting (5 minutes).) I cooked the steak for 4 minutes a side for medium 2 minutes at a time to get grill marks. While steak was resting and pizza was baking assembled the salad. Sliced the meat and divided over two plates. I should note that I halved the dressing as I didn't need 3/4 cup of the dressing for two plates.",
