I was a bit skeptical about leaving the peach pit in but it comes out extremely easily when it's sliced. Just watch your fingers--it's hot! Either my pie crust was too small my peaches were too big or I'm not very good at wrapping because I only had enough dough to make 3 beehives. I did have a tiny bit of dough left over so I decided to make bees. Don't laugh at the picture! I've never made them before! The crusts only browned a bit on top so maybe an egg wash would produce a better golden color. I didn't like the hard sauce plain before I put it on the peaches but hot over the peaches it's wonderful. It melts down and is a perfect complement. I think one peach half is a perfect serving not one peach so I guess I'll get several servings out of my three peaches.",

I also found it easier to seal the pieces with a dab of water. Do not wrap them too tight or they will break open in the oven. I had two of them do this. The cooking time was right on for me done to perfection after 40 minutes. I doubled the hard sauce because you need plenty to serve with these.",

I used biggish peaches so only got 2 per crust (ate a whole one too!). I followed Pomp's egg wash and bee suggestions. I had a hard time getting my dough to stick to itself and ended up brushing some water on. Also be careful not to wrap your peaches too tight - they expand while baking and may crack your hive. Thanks to Linda for the recipe and Pomplemousse for the beze (yours are way cuter and resentment is the secret ingredient... xo).:)",

I made a homemade pie crust which was probably a lot easier to work with beacause it would stick better. Keep a bit of water next to your working space to use it as glue on the crust. I brushed thses with egg whites and sprinkled them with sugar. When making the sauce make sure your butter is soft or the sauce will be clumpy. The sauce was a great addition to these! I didn't dare try making the bee out of the crust....it would have been the funiest looking bee you ever saw!",

I did a few things differently. I intended to use homemade pie crust but found some puff pastry in the back of my freezer so I used that instead. I'm not a fan of store bought pie crusts. Also it seemed complicated to me to cut the peach in half after it baked to get the pit out since I imagined the pastry crumbling. So I halved my peach took out the pit and then covered each half in pastry. (If you're gonna have to halve it before serving it anyway this seems easier. Added bonus - you get more dough and I love pastry! I'd make it again tomorrow if I didn't want to stay a size 8!",

So easy that young children can actually bake their own peach pies. I love the fact that it only uses the natural sweetness of the peach with no sugars or sweeteners added. A boom for guests who worry about their diets. It also makes a wonderful presentation if you just wrap a crust around the fruit without making a \"beehive\". I like to add a sprig of mint to look like a leaf. Yesterday I served it with bee pollen and creamed cinnamon honey from the bee farmers instead of the sauce. Totally addictive.",
