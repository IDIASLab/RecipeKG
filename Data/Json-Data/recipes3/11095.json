There is quite a bit of mushroom going on in the inside of the burger and so the shroom buns seems overkill. My mushroom caps were huge too so that might have played a part. Regardless this was a great recipe and I enjoyed it. I didn't end up using the egg and I used green onions for the onions. Great recipe and one I would make again!",
