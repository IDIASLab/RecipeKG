If that was in the original recipe I would up it to 5 stars. I also decreased the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. because of my kids and increased the honey to 4 tsp. I also added about 2 Tbsp. of low sodium soy sauce. I think this would be great with some nuts like toasted walnuts or cashews. I served this over angel hair pasta since we already had rice a lot this week and it was delicious!",

Fantastic \"Thai\" like meal - even the kids loved it!",

To finish it off I added 1/4 cup coconut milk & 1/4 cup chicken stock. I served it over coconut rice & I can't wait to make this again. Perhaps I will add some peppers and pineapple next time.
