Not only is this an easy dish, it has an outstanding flavor. The meat was done to perfection after eight hours and the au jus was to die for. I served on french rolls from this site.Since other reviewers had indicated it was a bit salty, I used half the Lite Sodium Soy Sauce and half the bouillon called for.I'm glad I did!

This recipe differs from others with the herbs and soy sauce which give the meat and au jus a nice, beefy flavor just subtlely enhanced by the herbs. For those who question soy sauce as an ingredient, it is one of many secrets of great chefs, who occasionally use it in beef gravies, sauces, and reductions for flavor and color. I used fresh herbs rather than  dried since I have a kitchen herb garden, and fresh, minced garlic for the garlic powder. Other than these minor modifications I made the recipe just as written, and it was perfect...not too salty at all, as others have thought. Perhaps they didn't use enough water?  Great take on the classic French Dip, Giselle.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

But I found that there were three key issues I had with the original.  My qualms were the following: 1. the type of roast wasn't specified.  For my first attempt I used a very cheap cut, which was too fatty, and the sandwiches were cloying.  I finally used a tri-tip, and it was fine.  This would have been good to know.  2. the slow cooking process seemed to mute the garlic flavour, drowning it out.  Again, after using fresh garlic, it really came to life.  3. When I used the bouillion, I found it too salty.  On the second attempt, I used homemade beef broth instead (low sodium consomme would have worked as well) and I enjoyed it much more.",

I use a 4-5 lbs chuck roast rubbing it with garlic powder seasoning salt salt and pepper then brown over the stove before adding to the slow cooker. I saute one onion sliced in the drippings from browning the roast and add it to the slow cooker to help flavor the au jus. After I pull the meat out I turn the slow cooker on high to reduce the au jus. To serve I use crusty rolls pile on the meat add cheese of choice and add some of the cooked onion and sauted onions.

The flavor was excellent, though! Also, we had a lot of au jus left over, and I hate to throw it out, so instead, I started searching for a reipe I could use it in. I found \"Quickie French Onion Soup\" (also on this site) and used the left over au jus to make a DELICIOUS soup. I counted my au jus as the beef broth and the au jus gravy packet called for in the recipe as I had 24 oz. of au jus left from this french dip recipe. My best friend and I loved it, and even my husband enjoyed it, and he doesn't even care much for french onion soup! It's a great way to use that au jus you have left over... give it a try!",

I used a 5 lb outside round roast and seasoned it with Montreal Steak spice and garlic powder and browned it in a skillet with some olive oil.  I then put it in the crock pot and mixed the broth.  I used a large container of Sodium reduced Cambells beef broth, minced garlic instead of garlic powder and the full amount of soy sauce.  I used only half of the rosemary and time the recipe called for as I noted this was mentioned in other reviews.  I skipped the bay leaf (personal prefference).  I also added 1 package fo Lipton french onion soup mix.  I cooked on high for 3 hours and then switched to low for 4 hours.  I probably could have cooked on low for the 7 hours I had and the roast would have been done but I think that might be my crock pots personality!  The meal tasted great!!  I serveed it with home made hoagie buns still warm from the oven with sauted mushrooms and onions, and slices of sharp cheddar cheese, Mashed potatoes, and fresh raw veggies and dip.  Everyone loved it and the Jus tasted wonderful on the mashed potatoes and the sandwiches.  I will make this again sometime.  Thanks for the recipe.",
