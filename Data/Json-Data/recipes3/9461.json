Add 1 can of water (or milk if you want it creamy), and you'll have a quick soup worthy of a five star rating.  And a sprinkle of grated parmesan on the top would be a good addition when serving.  I typically would have rated this lower than four stars because of the ingredient omission, but because this is the first review, I don't want to discourage anybody from trying this.  The final result is something that tastes homemade, not something out of a can.  It's good!   ***** 8.9.16***** I'd almost forgotten about this recipe.  Needed something really simple for a cup of soup, and once again, this didn't disappoint.  (with the addition of the water as mentioned in original review).",
