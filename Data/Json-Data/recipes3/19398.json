(They look like they were time consuming to make but really weren't.) My kids are asking to make them for their AWANA's club cookie exchange. That's high praise. I mixed marshmallow fluff and creme cheese icing together for the filling as per another suggestion. The tops did slip from the bottoms a bit probably due to the marshmallow fluff but it tasted good. This looks like a cookie that can be experimented with different flavored cake mixes and canned frostings for versatility too. A keeper of a recipe. Thanks!",

We found that making the dough balls the size of quarters worked best. But the ones we made the size of nickels sure were cute! In fact my kids shared the cookies with some of their friends and they chose the small ones first. For the filling we used the ding dong cake filling recipe(from this site) And added Peanut Butter to the mix. They were a hit. Before you add the filling the cookies are hard like an oreo but after adding the filling they become soft. Either way they are fantastic!",
