I mixed 1 tbs of flour with 1/4 cup of chicken broth then added the remainder of the can to the garlic and walnuts. Then I stirred in the flour and broth and ooked until it made a nice sauce. I'm a sauce junkie. I used it over Ronzoni wheat pasta and the sauce really holds it's own even with the wheat pasta.",

Added some tomatoes and diced chicken to make it a little heartier and a little extra oil and cheese to compensate for the extra ingredients.

I also substituted the walnuts for soy nuts as they contain more protein. Puree the mixture including the blue cheese in a mini food processor until smooth and pastey. Rather than using this on top of spaghetti I laid a thick layer in a soft burrito and placed scrambled eggs on top for an \"egg burrito\". It was absolutely delicious! The mixture may also be delicious on a toasted baguette or as a dip for vegetables. I believe there are many ways to enjoy this recipe - thank you Nancy!",
