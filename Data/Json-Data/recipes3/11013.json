You may have a hard time convincing picky eaters to give this one a try. It was super simple to throw together though I do NOT recommend my tweaks (which I'll share to save others: I increased the salt to TWO tsps....way too much and I subbed 1/2 tsp white pepper and 1/4ish tsp crushed red for the black because I hate black pepper...a bit too much heat)...fear not my review is NOT based on my tweaks. It's definitely worth giving a try for a quick weeknight dinner on a chilly fall day. THANKS for the recipe!",
