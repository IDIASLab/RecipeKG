I used diced/cooked butternut squash eliminated the mushrooms and instead vermicelli I used corn and barley.

I only added the shrimp after the soup had simmered because it was already cooked and I didn't want it to get rubbery. It was just the Thai soup recipe I'd been looking for.",

My substitutions: Canned tomatoes (happened to be the kind with green chiles) and a pickled jalepeno for the fresh... regular onion for the green onion (only 'cos I didn't have any!) Cappellini thin spagetti for the one called for. Thanks Zoe!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is overcomplicated. Why saut\u00e9 (basically) the same ingredients twice in two different pans? Why blanche/peel the tomatoes? Just saut\u00e9 the stuff add the spices then add the tomatoes etc. Also why cook the carrots in a separate pot? the only reason you'd need to do this is if you don't have a lot of time... otherwise it's better to let it all cook together gives it more depth. I agree with everyone s criticism that the pasta:liquid ratio is way too high... next time I ll be adding half the amount cuz even with a can of broth and some extra water it was still more like a runny pasta meal. Use fresh or frozen peas; canned vegetables are less nutritional/tasty. It s too bad all the flavor got cooked out of the shrimp... add them at the very end just after the pasta is cooked and shut off the burner. Let it sit and cook in the hot liquid for a couple minutes until they turn pink then serve. Furthermore I d also suggest upping the amount of garlic by at least 2x. Since I don t have turmeric lying around (it s mostly for color anyway like paprika) I used straight up curry powder (about 2 tbsp) with the cumin/coriander. And instead of Jalapeno (a Mexican ingredient) I used sriracha sauce ( 2.50 in the ethnic foods section... it s like a spicy Thai version of ketchup). I also added a couple teaspoons of sugar which was desperately missing. If you thought this recipe was good check out the 'Coconut Curry Tofu' recipe from user KATHYCOLLINS!",

This recipe was WAY too complicated! Too many dishes! Why are we cooking everything in a separate pan and why burn the spices?? Just cook everything (EXCEPT the pasta) in the same pan add the shrimp last! There wasn't enough liquid to cook the pasta in the pan so I did cook the pasta separately then spooned the \"sauce\" with shrimp over the pasta. I didn't taste the coconut at all. The cumin turmeric and coriander flavors were nice together but I felt that it needed more salt. I don't usually cook with salt but I did this time and something was definitely lacking.",
