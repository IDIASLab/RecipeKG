        "description": "I developed this recipe as a last-minute alternative to traditional cold bean salad.  It's not overly spicy, and it went over well with both kids and adults.  For those who love curry, this is an easy way to add a perked-up vegetable to a summertime menu. Lemon juice can be used in place of rice vinegar. Can be served immediately or refrigerated to blend flavors. For faster preparation, substitute dried versions of any of the flavorings (adjusting the amounts).",

I used fresh green beans which I had blanched and added to the pan and mixed with the aromatics. I think I would cut the oil to 2-3 tbs. I tried both chilled and warm and prefer warm. This was a hit or miss with my family they were almost evenly divided. Thanks for sharing.",
