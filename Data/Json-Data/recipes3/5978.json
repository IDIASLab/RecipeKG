Normally I rate recipes higher than he does but on this occasion that was reversed. He found this a lot more palatable than I did. As for me I didn't think it all that enhanced from the regular ol' can of beans. Also I didn't care for the lime juice here and would have preferred lemon. Extra vegetables would have been nice for flavor and interest as well as some seasoning - fresh herbs maybe garlic salt or fresh garlic. An okay starting point but that's about it at least for me.",
