Kept well in the fridge.\" Made recipe as written only I subbed 1/4 c. coconut oil & 1/4 c. applesauce for the peanut butter. The cookies completely fall apart after being baked but I liked the taste alot and I kept them in the fridge for a little over a week eating one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Now whether or not they've increased my milk supply I'm not sure only b/c I'm also drinking Mother's Milk tea and I made up a lactation zucchini muffin recipe too but hey if my baby's mursing well and I get to eat yummy things in b/t then all is good w/ me!",
