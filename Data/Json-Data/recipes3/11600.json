Thyme and rosemary always go great with chicken, and bacon...well it's bacon. My favorite side dish is mashed potatoes and French/Italian bread to soak up the juices. One time I forgot I didn't have potatoes, so on the fly I shredded the chicken, tossed the bones, and we had a great soup/stew on a cold night. A lot of flavor with very little work. Enjoy.",

One such gas station was giving away recipe packets as their promotional gift. Each packet had five or so recipes. This recipe, or something very similar was included in one of those packets. It quickly became my signature dish.\nUnfortunately, I lost the entire recipe box many years ago. I have been looking for this recipe ever since. I am so glad I found it again.\nI made the dish exactly as described using sauvignon blanc for the dry white wine and 1/2 pound of fresh white mushrooms.\nI don't think this recipe can truely be called Coq Au Vin since the Classic dish is normally prepared with red wine. Call it whatever you want. But TRY IT. It's delicious!",

If you want crunch bacon, I would suggest sprinkling it over the top of the chicken once you've plated the food. \n\nAdditionally, the bacon grease was a bit too much for my personal preference. Both my boyfriend and I thought the chicken was too greasy. I'd pour some of the bacon grease out before browning the chicken. \n\nLast by not least, the white wine was too prominent for my tastes. \n\nDespite all this, the flavoring is very good. Going forward I will reduce the bacon grease and wine, and only put the crispy bacon on the chicken once the food is plated.",

EDIT: If you are using boneless skinless thighs you will not want to cook the chicken for the time given. Remove and cover it until the sauce has reduced and then add it back in. The second time I made this I added mushrooms and I highly recommend that addition!",

I did not read the reviews until after I made the recipe but I like the suggestion of holding back the bacon pieces until the end so that they stay crispy although when I shared this with my husband he said he didn't notice the soggy bacon. The mushrooms added so much to this dish. I also loved the idea of serving this with mashed potatoes it was a great way to enjoy the sauce.",
