After reading the review, I decided to slightly modify the recipe:\nI used tomato/basil feta cheese, used sweet and spicy banana peppers chopped, chopped onion, garlic powder, extra basil, and cracked peppercorns (ground).  I couldn't put these down!  I only made two small patties (i only had a small amount of ground turkey), and I wish I had more because I would have eaten them all!",

I think this was the key to ensuring the burgers retained moisture and the banana peppers really marinated/tenderized the turkey meat. The burgers did not fall apart either and no I didn't add any binders i.e. eggs bread crumbs etc. Yes the feta disappears into the burger (ref: Holly's comment) but you can still taste it. I really like this but I think the key is putting all the ingredients together and letting it marinate overnight. So easy and tasty that I will make again.",

Up until now our favorite turkey burgers were a recipe from this site called \"Spicy Chipotle Turkey Burgers\" but now after trying this one there will be some serious competition between the two in our house. This recipe was SUPER SIMPLE with very few ingredients and SUPER FLAVORFUL results. I used a bit of A-1 steak sauce on mine and my husband used mustard on his... both ways were extremely tasty but truthfully they were even good just plain.
