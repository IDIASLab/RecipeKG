I made the following changes which I think made it better (my entire picky family loved it).  First of all, I marinated the peeled shrimp WITH the garlic, coursely chopped, and about a tbs. Italian seasoning, some fresh ground pepper, and 1/4 cup olive oil for about 2 hours.   I sauteed the shrimp until barely pink (with the garlic, of course), and I added the parm. cheese with the wine, and simmered for about 5 minutes, then used about 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs to thicken.  Came out great, sauce neither too thin nor thick, excellent flavor.",

Then I removed the shrimp and added 1 cup of white wine,a few basil and parsley flakes, and fresh ground pepper. I simmered this for a few minutes and at the end I added a couple teaspoons of ground seasoned croutons (I put them in the blender). I added one teaspoon at a time because it really thickens quick. I poured this mixture over the cooked noodles and sprinkled with more of the ground croutons and parmesan cheese.",

It was seriously, AMAZING. I felt so accomplished serving this gourmet dish (which was secretly very easy). I did make some changes: I used a LOT more garlic and left it in rather than pulling it out, used spaghetti rather than angel hair, used chicken broth instead of wine, used Italian bread crumbs, doubled the sauce, and added some lemon juice. (Most of which were changes I had read in previous reviews). Adding the breadcrumbs slowly is a must. Thanks for this fun and simple recipe.

I did have chicken broth on hand and subbed it for the wine and crushed up caeser croutons to replace the bread crumbs. I had leftovers for breakfast and lunch the following day--couldn't stop eating it!! We adore garlic so I could help myself from using about 6 gloves sliced. Very high in calories but tasty for a once in a while supper! Thanks for such a yummy recipe!",
