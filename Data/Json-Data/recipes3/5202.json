I used a specialty pasta rather than penne, but made no changes or substitutions, just eyeballed ingredients to taste. Freshly grated Parmesan is a must, as it provides a ton of flavor. Growing up in an Italian family, I can say this is a very traditional way to serve pasta, and lends itself well to including any variety of vegetables.",
