Use what ever assortment of beans you like.",

The meat and bean mixture turned out delicious. The flaw is in the dressing. Four cups of mayonnaise is way too much.My recommendation is to use 1 cup or less of sauce for the meal. And I used low fat which is 30 calories per tablespoon vs. the 100 calorie per tablespoon for actual mayonnaise. I will definitely make this again but not as it reads.",

Instead of the ground beef I used frozen \"Gardein\" meatless ground beef. Recipe called for 2 TBS chili powder but I used 1. I loved this recipe. I had leftovers which I'll have for lunch tomorrow thanks to JJ. Thank you for a fast great recipe Penguinite!",
