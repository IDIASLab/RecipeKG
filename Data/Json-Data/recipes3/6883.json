If you like cheeseburgers, melt your favorite cheese, and eat! We love to load ours onto potato rolls and add lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles. As my sister says, 'Don't forget the bacon!'",

UPDATE: We've made these a number of times now, so we don't always have all the ingredients on hand.  You can substitute italian style bread crumbs for the garlic and herb, any type of full bodied beer will do (we used Michelob lager, beer just gives it more moisture). You can use parmesan instead of romano and you can use 1/2 to 1 Tbsp. of dried basil vs. fresh or just leave it out depending on your tastes.  After mixing everything together and making the patties we always leave them in the fridge for a half hour to let all the ingredients time to settle before grilling.",

I used a white onion instead of green and added a green pepper (very finely chopped so the meat holds together). I also put the meat in the fridge for about an hour before grilling because it helps the patties hold up. Other than that I followed everything and these were some of the best. I have tried the dried basil but stick to the fresh basil if you can it has a much fresher taste and really comes through in the burger. DO NOT RUIN THIS BURGER WITH A CRAPPY BUN buy a nice kaiser or something from the bakery butter it and toast it on the grill. You will not be disappointed.",
