They were not quite as flavorful as another recipe I made along with these BUT i liked the cilantro/jalapeno in these and I liked that you browned them on all side. These definitely had the better texture. When I make these again I will add a little bit of soy sauce and green onions to bump the flavor up. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!",
