No real prep.  Easy-peasey and I got tons of compliments.  \n\nIf you're looking for a quick, easy way to candy your own walnuts, I suggest this:\n\nMelt 1 tbsp butter in a skillet on medium heat.  Add in 3 tbsp honey and mix, then add in 1 1/2 cup walnuts.  Cook for 5 minutes or until walnuts are toasted.\n\nSpread onto parchment paper and let cool for 1 or 2 minutes.  Separate any nuts that are clumping at this time, then let cool completely.",
