I also used minced garlic instead of the powder as others had suggested. I cooked the rice seperate in chicken broth. Then followed the instuctions for boiling the yams (about 20 min. 40 min. would be too long.) Once yams were tender I added cooked rice. I was afraid that the rice would not get cooked and that is why I did it this way. It looked really good but I decided to use a potato smasher to \"messy smash\" some of the potatoes and leave some of them not smashed. The result was a thicker soup that was just WONDERFUL. I will make this again and again. Thanks!",
