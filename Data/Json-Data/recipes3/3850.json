I like to add the bread crumbs to the meatballs instead of rolling them in it - makes a great meatball! But as written they are WAY too salty so you have to cut the salt by at least half. The sauce is nice but tends to need a little tweaking to be interesting. Its great comfort food and worth making but the written recipe is just off enough to ruin it if you aren't careful. I'll probably make a version of these again anyway - and probably never would have if I hadn't found this recipe so thanks!:)",

I wasn't enthusiastic about it but surprisingly found I was a lot fonder of them than I thought I'd be. But I did bump up the flavor a bit since I noticed that other than some salt pepper and a little onion it was totally lacking any seasoning. I knew some garlic fresh parsley and a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce couldn't hurt. More important it wasn't until after I had the meatballs mixed up that I realized to my surprise that the bread crumbs weren't intended to be included in the mix - rather the meatballs were to be rolled in them. Frankly that seemed odd to me so I'm glad I made the \"mistake\" of adding the bread crumbs the traditional way to the meat mixture. But it's really the sauce that brings these meatballs to life - creamy with a pronounced fresh dill flavor. These were part of our assortment of appetizers for our New Year's Eve celebration but the ample amount left over will be great reheated and served over hot buttered noodles. Four stars rather than five simply for the instruction to roll the meatballs in bread crumbs rather than adding them to the meat mixture.",
