She cooks bacon in large cast iron skillet. leaves all grease in it and adds onions, grn peppers, fresh minced garlic, and rice to skillet and cooks for about 7-10 minutes. then she puts in two cans of tomotoes, crushed slightly by hand, and juice also and a little water to just cover rice good. brings to a boil, reduces heat to med-low and put lid on for 10 mins. She adds a bit of water as needed and finishes rice without the lid. The rice is fluffy and moist, having absorbed liquids. You do not want to have this too wet. bacon is broken up and mixed in. My mom serves this with fried chicken,and refried beans with melted cheese. Yummy! But I also serve this with shreded pork/or chicken tacos, anything that is mexican!My moms version came from a friend that grew up in Spain.",

I followed the recipe except for one thing: I didn't have green peppers, so I did as another reviewer suggested, I used diced green chiles (I put the entire 4 ounce can in). It was great and we decided to always use this one substitution. I had to add a bit more liquid as the rice cooked...ended up using an entire 14 oz can chicken broth and 15 oz can tomato sauce. Had this with Salsa Chicken, also from this site, and it made a great meal. Thank you for the recipe, DivaDee!! We will be making this quite often!",

I substituted 1/2 can of diced green chiles for the bell pepper because I didn't have a pepper and skipped the olives and corn. Also chopped the bacon prior to frying to ease preparation. It tasted wonderful! Will definitely keep this recipe around for years!",
