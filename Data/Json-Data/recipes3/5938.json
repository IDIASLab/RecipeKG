One, I seasoned the fish to my liking BEFORE the flour, that way the fish got seasoned, not the coating. Second, I cooked the fish in the oven the way I do ovwen fried chicken. I heat up the pan in the oven first, and aadd whatever oil or butter I want to use ( usually a combination ) Then I added the  fish. Cooked it halfway thru, then flipped it over to finish cooking. Both sides get crispy, the fish gets cooked before it burns. My husband and I both enjoyed it.",
