Baking the tofu before frying helps to crisp it up and imparts the meatiness I was seeking. My BFF thought it was fish at first glance. He is not into foreign foods but he was very enthusiastic about these yummy little bites when served with dipping sauce.",

It is a bit labor intensive, but y\u2019all gotta trust me, this is the lightest, crispiest, flavorful tofu I\u2019ve ever eaten. The exterior has a delicate crunch when you bite into it. Inside it is soft and chewy, spiced just enough. I served it over fried rice and stewed beans. As written in the notes, I always freeze my tofu. It really helps the texture.",
