Sounds like an odd combination - it is not. It just works. And most of the time required is totally inactive, so it is easy to make. Enjoy!",

The cook time was just right.  The meat fell apart perfectly.  To make this a 5 star dish, some spice needs to be added.  Next time I might try adding star anise or Chinese 5 spice (which has star anise & cinnamon in it).  I think that will make this entr\u00e9e fantastic.",

I thought the hoisin sauce could have been reduced by at least half, and maybe better as a brush on. \nThe sauce in the bottom of the dutch oven, after pouring off the rendered fat, was too thick, and was a challenge to remove the ginger slices. Basically, we skipped the sauce except for what was on the meat, which was served over mashed potatoes. The taste was good, and the meat was done to a perfect tenderness.",
