And don't EVEN think about making this unless you have a food chopper to get your mushrooms and other fillings into \"small dice\". But I did find a way to make this work. If you have a mini-muffin pan, purchase a box of pre-made pie crusts. Roll them out a little thinner, and use a 3\" diameter glass or cookie cutter to make little circles of dough. Be sure to flour your work surface. Spray your little pans well with cooking spray, and fit the little circles of dough into the cups. Then fill with the filling, which I must say is very delicious. Bake at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes or until you can see that the dough is browning. I served these at a party the other night and the guests were highly impressed that I made them. They looked storebought.",

First of all it was impossible to roll the biscuit dough into 5\" circles even when I doubled it to two biscuits per circle. It resulted in empanadas that couldn't be easily sealed and the filling came spilling out as it baked. Also the dough tasted odd with the mushroom goat cheese mixture - I will not make this recipe again.:(",

Also, use a fork to press down around the edges to seal the dough so the filling won't leak out.  I also used more garlic & cilantro to add a little more flavor.  Dipping in a salsa verde is a great combo.  ",
