I think the chicken was flavored through better for this. I used 2 chicken breast halves but did not increase salt or coriander. I used cayenne instead of a red chili (didn't have one). I added a tomato and a pinch of salt to salsa. Serve over coconut rice as another reviewer suggested which was good but I think next time I'll try serving in corn tortillas with lettuce tomato and avocado. Thank you for the neat recipe!",
