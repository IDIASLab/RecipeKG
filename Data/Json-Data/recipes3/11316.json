I really liked it ! (Hubs not so much, I'm afraid, who thought it tasted weird.  Something in it he couldn't put his finger on, he said)  I had no roasted red peppers, but I did have pimiento-stuffed olives and red bell pepper.  Actually, I preferred that combo anyway because this was in need of some texture and crunch - which is why I also added green onion and celery.  Just can't have egg salad without celery.  I thought the curry might be too bold a presence,  but it proved to be very subtle.  There wasn't enough mayonnaise in my view, but I did like that it wasn't overly mayonnaise-y.  Still, it needed some creaminess and adding some heavy cream was the solution.  I enjoyed the blend of all the ingredients, but particularly the olives and capers.  Yvonnelong, this was some awesome good egg salad.",

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. It was beautiful in appearance and had an excellent texture. For the red peppers I used roasted  peppers from a jar. At first I thought I wouldn't need salt because of the olives and capers, but it did need a touch. This is definitely a keeper of a recipe and will give variety to those days when a quick and tasty sandwich is in order. My thanks to yvonnelong - you are very creative.",
