So that is my tip--don't over think it and let the tomatoes and cheese take center stage.",

A really neat way to use up green tomatoes too. I used half a stick of butter instead of olive oil added 2 cloves minced garlic and my feta was sundried tomato basil flavor. We were quite curious about how the recipe would turn out and it ended up being great! Next time I'm going to cut back on the cheese or else just sprinkle with a little grated parmesan because as good as the dish was the feta flavor dominated over the tomato flavor. We liked it enough though that I plan to just cook some noodles and toss in a bit of butter and feta if I need a quick easy dinner sometime in the future.",
