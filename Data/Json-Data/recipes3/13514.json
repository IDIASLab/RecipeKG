We followed one of the optional instructions and baked them in the oven first at 400 degrees to crisp up the bacon and then at the 375. They did take a lot longer to get to cook, but it was worth it.  The longer cook time could be do to the size of our bombs. I used toothpicks in lieu of cooking twine. I also placed a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet to allow the grease to drip.  I made one with an actual stuffed jalapeno and two with jalapenos chopped into the cream cheese spread. We preferred the jalapenos chopped into the cheese spread.  I also added garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper into the cream cheese spread. We will make these again!!",
