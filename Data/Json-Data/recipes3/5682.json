First it was way too much for a first taste so I did a 6th of the recipe which was a very manageable amount - made about 1 cup or a little more. I also added some sour cream (maybe 1/2 cup?) to make it a little less thick. I did the bacon but I don't think it changed the flavor all that much. I'd probably leave it out next time just to save time and money.",
