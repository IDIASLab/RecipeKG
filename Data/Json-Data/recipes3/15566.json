I didn't have blueberry jam so I used seedless black raspberry jam and added some frozen blueberries. I liked the different textures from all the ingredients and I really liked the almond extract. The only thing I had to do was add a little water in the morning to get the consistency I wanted. Thanks for this recipe!",
