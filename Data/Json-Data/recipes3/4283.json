                "reviewBody": "I have no need to eat restaurant curry ever again as this recipe is fantastic IF you make some modifications! Before starting to cook, I marinated the cut chicken in a mixture of plain yogurt, tumeric, and pepper to give the chicken a great flavor and prevention against drying out. Once you start the actual dish, add extra onion and a lot of extra garlic (I used 6 cloves) and saute taking care not to burn the garlic.  I added a bit more canned tomato than the recipe called for and supplemented with fresh chopped plum tomatoes.  Add more curry than the recipe suggests - perhaps 1 Tbsp or more to suit your taste.  I was a bit heavy-handed on the salt and it was perfect.  The end result will be too bland if you're not.  Tasting as you go is your best bet.  Prior to adding the coconut I was sure to add a healthy dash of cayenne pepper to give the recipe a kick.  I only added 1/2 of the can of coconut milk as any more would have made the dish too soupy.  During this stage I also added about 1 Tbsp of light brown sugar and juiced only 1/2 of a large lemon.  \n\nThis dish will amaze YOU as well as your friends and family if modified to your liking. Don't be shy with experimenting with flavors.  The next modification will be to add vegetables to the saute.",

I did make some changes though which I will reveal in order to make your dish of curry as good as mine. Let's see.. first make sure you use bonless chicken cause it is a b h pulling the bones out of that sucker. On to the next step.. I used garlic flavored olive oil instead of regular but that isn't nescesary at all. My next change was to make absolutely certain the tomatoes were as drained as possible and to dice them as well. Next I used probably a total of 2 or more tablespoons of curry powder most of which I added during the coconut milk stage. Just be sure to tast it frequently and add the curry powder to meet your own personal preference. Next I added around 1-2tbsp of dark brown sugar and about a tsp of new mexico chili powder THIS STEP IS A MUST!!!! Next I added only about 3/4 can of coconut milk which I thought was perfect but I was told the whole can could of been used. Again it depends on personal preference so taste frequently. Last I ended up only using about 1/2 the amount of lemon juice which everyone thought was lemony enough. Last last be sure to serve over rice it's delicious that way! I hope I could help!",

Over-all this is a great recipe for anyone to try! I myself tend to want veggies in my sauce. hmmm wonder how this sauce would be over asparaguss omitting the tomatoes of course!

I read through the suggestions and added some brown sugar and doubled the curry. I think the chicken tastes much better if marinated a short while ahead of time. I mixed some plain yoghurt with turmeric in a bowl and then put the chicken in (whole), covered it and stuck it in the fridge. Then I started chopping the onion and getting out the other ingredients. It can marinate anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. While the onion cooks I take out the chicken and cube it. It tastes especially tender and delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again!",
