Aside from scaling the recipe down for 2 burgers adding some salt to the pico and a little garlic powder to the guacamole I kept the recipe the same. Served these on toasted buns. All of the flavors blended perfectly...DELICIOUS! I will be making these often YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I think a lot of the great flavor was because I used bison meat (seriously it's so much yummier than your standard ground beef and healthier too!) but it was mostly just a great recipe. And by the time I mixed in all the onions and so on into my meat I had enough to make about twice the patties (2oz meat per patty) which was awesome - I could have two burgers for the guilt of one!:) Thank you for the recipe; these burgers were delicious!",
