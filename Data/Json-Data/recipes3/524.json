The sauce was so good, i had trouble not picking up the plate and licking it like a little kid!I, like many others, doubled the sauce and am thinking of tripling it next time.I thickened it with cornstarch mixed with a tiny bit of water so it wouldnt clump. The chicken was nice and tender, and the mushrooms were great. I used more shallots, about 4 tbs. I didnt use tarragon, i used this herb mix my ma has, Herbs de Provence. DELICIOUS!!! Thank you so much for this delicious and easy meal. (served with mashed potatoes and broccoli)",

First of all I think that there needed to be a little more shallots and muschrooms but that is not a big deal and just a matter of preference. I cut the chicken breasts into quarters before cooking to make the dish a little easier to handle for various appetites. Additionally I added a little more chicken stock white wine and port because I though the recipe did not call for enough of it for a good proportion. The fresh tarragon is a judgement call. I am not a huge tarragon fan but tried it and of course I got what I expect... a nice tarragon aftertaste but sometimes I think fresh tarragon takes away from the taste. If other people are not big tarragon fans i would suggested maybe using a bay leaf or two. The last thing is that I added a little milk to a portion of the sauce to see who it changed my feeling and you can't go wrong with either one. If you prefer creamier sauces add some milk otherwise the sauce itself it fine. Thanks for the recipe Carol. I will make it again sometime.",

Husband would have liked to have had more mushrooms so next time I will add more as well as more shallots. Used French bread to sop up the yummy sauce. Also there was a reference to adding additional thyme but on my printout there was no previous reference to thyme. I added thyme and more tarragon to compensate. Chicken was extremely moist and that pleased my husband. He is not a chicken fan especially not dry chicken but he went nuts over this dish.",
