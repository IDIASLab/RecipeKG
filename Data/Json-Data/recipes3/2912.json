My husband grew up on home made biscuits and thought they were as good as any he had ever eaten.  Made 2 batches, one with milk and one with buttermilk, both turned out pretty much the same, we just prefer them made with buttermilk.\r\nAlso, I make 4 batches at a time as they freeze really well.  Just be sure to roll them in flour and lay on a tray flat in the freezer.  When they have frozen I put them in a zipperer bags and store in freezer.",

                "reviewBody": "Had these biscuits tonight with friends. I made 2 batches and the first one didn't rise hardly at all and suspected my baking powder was the problem so I added an extra heaping teaspoon of fresh baking powder in the 2nd batch that I already had assembled and waiting for the milk. The 2nd batch rose a lot more than the first so I feel that the next time when I use the full tablespoon of fresh BP the biscuits will rise even better. I wonder if this could be the main problem with other reviewers that didn't have good lift in their biscuits. My BP was in what I thought was a very tightly closed container and didn't even think it wouldn't work. Live and learn! UPDATE 12/25. Made 3 double batches this morning. I made them per the recipe and found that 3/4\" thick on the bread board made a nicer looking biscuit than patting out to 1/2\". My dough was quite moist and used a spatula to get it on to the WELL floured board. Put a bit of flour on my hands and a bit on the top of the dough and just patted it out about half way to what I wanted and then flipped it over onto more flour and patted to thickness I liked. Used a 3 1/2\" cutter and got about 11 nice biscuits. Don't twist the cutter when you press it down. I did once just to see if it did make a difference, and yes it did, it sealed the edge and didn't let the biscuit rise hardly at all. Also clean the cutter in between batches. The hardening dough will \"crimp\" the edge like twisting the cutter. All in all a great, simple recipe!",

This in effect \"seals\" the edges of the dough and will prevent from baking up sky high and delectable.  I did make mine huge - recipe yielded 5 - and I couldn't be happier.

They are great as a side to pasta, soup, breakfast, or with jelly. I've also replaced the milk with yogurt and they turn out even more moist. Love them!",
