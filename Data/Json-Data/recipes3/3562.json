If this soup got a bad review, it was because it was served too soon. The gravy leaves a strange aftertaste on the day made but if you wait a day the crab overcomes the strange taste and makes this a great soup! We did add extra crab meat and a little more old bay.",

I've had this soup before but can't place where or when. All I recall is that I loved it when I had it the first time--and loved it even more today since I was the one who prepared it! I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did. The wine is a must. It's the wine that provides the warm exotic base from which the soup is built. I used 3/4 of the wine that was recommended but I wouldn't be afraid to use the full amount next time. I was wary of using all the wine that was called for after reading the reviews but if you have a sophisticated palate and are used to having wine in recipes it won't bother you. You will embrace it. I added about 1/2 of the hot sauce called for and didn't detect a change in the flavor. Honestly I was afaid to keep going with the hot sauce. The soup was already so good that I didn't want to fiddle with it and chance that it wouldn't be as good post hot sauce. The batch I prepared did need salt and I added it one pinch at a time until it was perfect. If you use salted butter you may not need any extra salt. Wow this one gets a blue ribbon.",

Next time, I'll omit the hot sauce and cut the pepper back to 1/4 tsp.  I decreased the butter to 1/4 cup, and used fat-free half-and-half, and it was just fine.  Also, if the crabmeat you're using is pre-salted, there is most likely no need to add the 1/2 tsp.  You can always add it later if it needs it.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I used the published amounts of butter and flour then doubled the Old bay and Wocestershire used double the chicken broth and 1 1/2 cups white wine & half and half. In place of the gravy mix (could not find) I used a 12oz prepared white wine veluete sauce. Simply scrumptious. A winner for sure. Making this for Christmas Eve celebrations.
