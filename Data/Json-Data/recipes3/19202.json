I took tips from myself and other reviews as follows: 1.) season chicken, but watch the salt since the sauce has soy sauce 2.) add 2 tbsp cornstarch and boil sauce on stovetop until thick 3.) cover chicken and cook 45 mins @ 375 4.) uncover and cook for 15 more mins. This came out REALLY good for me. The chicken was tender but not dry and the wings were truly \"sticky.\" The sauce was stuck to them and it was O SO GOOD. You won't be disappointed.",

I did add a dash of cayenne pepper to tone down the sweetness a bit - to fit my own taste. This was a trial run - I will serve it for company next week. Be sure and put a cookie sheet below your baking dish - when this begins to carmelize - it may overflow. It makes a beautiful piece of chicken - like the photos in cookbooks. Again thank you Sandy for sharing. It is absolutely wonderful. I wish I could give it 6 stars. P.S. I forgot to add: I prepared teh sause in a pot on the stove brought it to a boil and then turned the fire out - a must for it to carmelize correctly. Also I turned the chicken breast over after 30 minutes. If it is too sweet for you cut back on the honey and add a extra catchup maybe little mustard. Enjoy!",

In the 7 years we have been married this is the only recipe that I couldn't find anything good to say about.  I believe my candid response was this taste like butt.\r\n\r\nNormally I wouldn't be so harsh but it was an involuntary response... it just sort of came out.  She has made many recipes since then and 95% of them are very tasty.  4.99% of them are interesting (she likes to experiment)... and then there is the .01% that is the wings.\r\n\r\nMaybe something went terribly awry and this really is a good recipe...  I don't know.  I just couldn't resist writing about our expereience when I saw this recipe in her recipe box.\r\n\r\nSorry to the original poster. My intention is not to be overly critical.

I got this recipe several months ago and I can't count the number of times I have made it. I have only made it so far with chicken breasts as a main dish. It will be wonderful with pork chops. The sauce is wonderful with rice. If you don't like or don't have honey you can substitute corn syrup (for all or a portion of the honey) it is virtually the same just without that hint of honey. I can't imagine not having this recipe anymore. I will ALWAYS keep this recipe in my baking arsenol.",

I poured the liquid mixture over the chicken and put in the oven for 1 hour (without covering). The sauce did not caramelize. I put the pan on the lower oven rack as suggested by others and basted one time during baking. After one hour my chicken was starting to dry out and burn. I took the chicken out of the oven and removed it from the pan. The juices were starting to burn along the inside of the pan so I put the sauce in a fresh pan and baked for another 20 minutes. The liquid did not caramelize. Taking into consideration how many people have been unable to get the liquid to caramelize I'm wondering whether an ingredient or an additional step was left out of the receipe. The taste was good but the consistency was like water. Do wings have considerably less water than other chicken pieces so that wings are sticky but other pieces are not? What is the trick?",
