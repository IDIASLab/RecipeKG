I also found that frying the chicken over med-high heat was too high--the chicken was dark brown on the outside and raw in the middle. The coating was crispy and delicious though. I will make this again omitting the cocoa and cooking on a lower heat and I think I will end up with an awesome recipe for chicken nuggets!",

Also I used 3 chicken breasts. I wasn't quite sure how many pounds that was but I ran out of egg before I was done. So I had to add another egg. I also wondered why so much flour was called for. I had tons left over when I was done. Same goes for the bread crumbs. I also ran out of oil in the pan. Maybe I shouldn't have cut up the chicken in so little of pieces. So even though there were some complications during the cooking the end product turned out fine.",
