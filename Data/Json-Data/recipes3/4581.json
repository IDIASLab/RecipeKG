I cooked that first and then put that in a 2 quart casserole dish with all the other ingredients but instead of using 1 1/2 cups of apple juice I used 1 cup of apple juice and 1/2 cup of apple butter. Microwave it on high for 5 minutes and stir then on high for another 5 minutes.",

I served it with the Caramel Apple Pork Chops recipe from this site and the two went together well (as long as you don't mind cinnamon and apples in both your main dish and side dish.)
