In addition to scrambled eggs, I would recommend using queso fresco (a mexican white cheese) which crumbles well instead of cottage cheese, salsa instead of ketchup, and add sliced avocado or guacamole.

I did my scramble the way I normally do (salt pepper and a random spice; essence or tumeric...anything that will give it a little extra something). Browned the tortillas once on the second side I put goat cheeese and let it soften while browning the tortilla. Removed from heat added thinly sliced avocado then the scrambled eggs and that was it. Cottage cheese and ketchup did not seem right with this. But I didn't try it. Thanks for the idea we really enjoyed this!!",
