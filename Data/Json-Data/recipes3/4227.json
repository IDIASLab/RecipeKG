It took me a while to get the garbanzo mixture creamy in the blender so I added a little lemon juice for extra liquid. I think you could just substitute hummus (even flavored) for the blended creation as a shortcut. Also I think it would be interesting to substitute some uncooked broccolini or broccoli slaw (it comes shredded in a bag in the veggie dept. if you're having problems finding it) on top of the hummus & chicken for a nice texture.",

This satisfied our craving for both requirements! The hardest part is the blender (and even that's not too hard). I had some packaged coleslaw mix from the day before so I used that BUT I didn't have broccoli coleslaw (I don't even know what that is). So I took the former reviewer's advice - used chopped red and green bell peppers. I also used more chicken and added some diced celery as well. Finally I too added dashes of onion/garlic powders to the chicken saute. I did have to add a little more S&P to the \"spread\" but no biggie. We LOVED THIS RECIPE! Taste like it came from a deli when really it was outta my kitchen! If we could give it 10 stars - we would! Thanks for the AWESOME recipe!!",
