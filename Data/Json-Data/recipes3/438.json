I also didn't have any condensed milk so I had to make a substitute using evaporated milk and sugar and it still turned out okay. This might explain why I had to bake 10 min longer than the recipe called for. After adding the frosting (I used the sour cream chocolate frosting on this site) it tasted great. Overall it was easy to make. I'm subtracting a star just because the actual cake needed more chocolate but after tweaking it a bit I will make this again.",

The batter was pretty wet; no surprise but quite applesauce looking. It filled the pan nicely then dropped to be similar to a cakelike brownie a lowfat cakelike brownie. I'll pass. Baked Pumpkin bread from the same submitter is very good btw.:) 'Think the thickness/thinness of the applesauce has a lot to do with this recipe being a success.",
