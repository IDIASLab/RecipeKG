I would make a few suggested changes. reduce the Cayenne, I like it hot but that is way over the top. I would use a dash or two for starters. boneless chicken thighs are a good substitute, they remain more moist. I would use one pepper with the seeds chopped. If you are going to use coconut milk, use the real stuff, eat less if you have to, its worth the flavor. one final suggestion, add the chicken back into the sauce for 15min on simmer.",

After the chicken was mostly cooked through I added a can of diced tomatoes sprinkled the ginger olive oil and garlic powder over the tomatoes added hot diced green chilis and mixed it all into the chicken. I let it simmer for about 10 minutes added the coconut milk and let simmer another 5 minutes. I served it over Basmati rice. Next time I will add diced potatoes to the dish.",
