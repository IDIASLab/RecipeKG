I made it twice - first time I couldn't find green onions so I used chives...great results! 2nd time I didn't have hot sauce so I just added red pepper flakes and a tiny bit of red wine vinegar - not as good as with the hot sauce but it did the trick! PLUS I used the leftovers to stuff chicken breasts and it was SO good! Just thin out the chicken breast, put about 1/3 cup of the mixture (pre-cooked) on, roll it up and place the breasts in a baking dish with a little butter and white wine. Bake at 450 for 10 minutes - reduce heat to 350 and bake for another 15-20 minutes or so (until chicken isn't pink throughout). Delicious!!",

I had no wine or 1/2 and 1/2. I used one can of hot rotel(drained) instead of the hot sauce. I used 8oz of cream cheese instead of mayo and 2%milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2. It was delicious! We especially liked the spice of the rotel as well as the tomatoes. Hope this was helpful and thanks for posting!!",

I melted that plus an 8oz block of cream cheese in the microwave until softened/melted. Then I added 3 Tbsp minced garlic 1 lb bag of frozen spinach that was thawed and squeezed dry 3/4 cup white wine no salt about 1 tsp pepper about 1 1/2 tsp hot sauce no green onion 1 lb shredded mozzarella 1/2 cup Miracle Whip and a whole can of evaporated milk (I didn't have any half and half on hand). I also added about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. I mixed it all up and put it in a 9x13 casserole dish and baked it at the suggested 350 degrees. I had to cook it a little longer because there was so much of it closer to 30 minutes or until the top got a little golden brown. But it was seriously AWESOME!!!!",
