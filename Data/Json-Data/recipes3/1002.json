It was wonderful!  I have also doubled the recipe, using no crust & baked it in an 11x7 Pyrex dish for approx. 70-75 minutes.  Cut into squares & served many at a brunch!

It tastes great, but it's a bit finicky, and sometimes I have a hard time getting it to set up properly. It does seem to help using three eggs instead of two. DO NOT use low-fat mayo or it will never set up. I've made it with different cheeses and with other meats or veggies in lieu of crab; it's very versatile and tasty with all the variations. But make sure it's well browned on top, and test it with a knife to make sure it's set before you take it out of the oven. ",

If you can spring for fresh crab meat usually found ready-to-go in small containers at your grocers seafood dep't. I've made the dish with both canned and fresh crabmeat without telling my family of the change and they picked up on it. Fresh crab meat will cost you about 2- 3 more but if you can't spring for fresh go ahead and make the recipe with the canned crab meat because it is still a really great quiche.",

Perhaps this would be better by using half and half or cream and not putting in the mayo. Increase the amount of liquid to compensate for not having the mayo. Don't be tempted to use canned crab. Canned crab tastes nothing like fresh crab. Quiche is meant to be mild tasting. It's French and they don't use hot sauce etc.",
