They actually turned out pretty good I was a little nervous because of past reviews. A note to future reviewers. These are a healthy cookie; you can't try to compare them to a regular chocolate chip or sugar cookie for instance they are not supposed to be super sweet. If thats the only kind of cookie you eat you probably won't like these. That said my family enjoyed these they are slightly sweet and where a definite hit with my two toddlers. I did try another batch using honey in place of half of the apple juice and I did not like that version. Anyway I recomend this recipe (as written) to anyone looking for a good healthy cookie!",

My dough was extremely wet though and I will experiment with adding more dry ingredients next time. Definitely worth another try! Thanks for this great idea! Update: I made these two more times and I found that 3 1/4 c wheat flour was about right for the dough in my opinion; everything else the same. Also good with 1/2 c raisins (unchopped) and 1/2 c nuts added. Fabulous and so healthy!",
