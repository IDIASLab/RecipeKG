The herb mixture is perfect, including the plain black pepper.  I saut\u00e9ed the carrots and potatoes in a 12\u201d frypan, then added everything to that pan to mix well, break up the salmon, before putting into the crockpot.  Used spinach instead of kale and put that in only at the last 20 min or so.   Serve w cornbread or breadsticks, took it to work.  Just delish, warm, but not heavy.",
