This is a AUTHENTIC recipe..many are not.. you can also use ALL FETA with the same other ingredients..the Kefalori cheese is Not easy to find but using all feta is also traditional tiropita. Adding spinach as some did is spanakopita and that is a different item altogether! This is supposed to be ALL CHEESE! Thank you for sharing a traditional recipe! Its great",

I will only make a few very minor changes in the future: I will omit the salt. Feta and the Greek cheese are fairly salty on their own. And next time I'm going to try and blend the cheese mixture and the white sauce together. It tastes amazing as is but the church I got it from has a smoother texture for the filling.",
