First of all I didn't have bell peper but I added garlic;second I didn't marinate the whole thing for 1hour or more cause I didn't have enough time-instead I cooked it for 1hour(not 30 min.) and finally third I added some mozarella at the end! It was so delish...I really enjoyed it! This is also a healthy recipe made with natural ingrediens not canned stuff grease sugar or syrup.",
