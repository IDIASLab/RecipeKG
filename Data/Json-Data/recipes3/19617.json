We've made this for years, it works equally well with chicken or beef (just change to cream of mushroom soup, and add a little beef base).  My kids, who are very picky love it.  I just have to say, when you change a recipe completely, before trying it as written, how in the world can you honestly give it a review???  I love this website, but the reviews drive me nuts, lol.  Changing a few small things, because you didn't have something on hand is one thing, but to change the entire recipe, turn it into a mashed potato casserole, then call yourself reviewing a turkey pot pie??  I'm sorry, vent over:)",

I made a few substitutions and additions that I think made it even better. I substituted 2t. minced dried onion for the fresh (which reduced liquid content slightly) and 1c. evap. milk for 1/2c. milk. I think this made it creamier but not runny. I added 1t. chicken boullion granules some pepper and 1/2t. of each of the following spices: poultry seasoning paprika dried parsley and garlic powder. My husband put it together and he cut out small gingerbread shapes from the extra pie dough and put them on top of the top crust to entice the kids to eat. The refrigerated pie crusts are MUCH better than the frozen by the way.",

After glancing over the other ratings, I could see this is a very versatile recipe.  I omitted the onions, added dried minced onions, garlic salt, oregano, lots of freshly goudn pepper, and substituted cream of chicken for cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. I used the refridgerated pie crusts, the mixed veggies from Costco's freezer section, and extra turkey from Thanksgiving's fried bird.  Left it in the fridge all day for my husband to bake when he got home, and I came home to a delicious and tremendously easy dinner.  This is definitely going into our winter dinner rotation.

I made the following modifications: instead of frozen mixed veggies I used freshly cut carrots, celery and diced potatoes. I didn't saute the onion first--just threw it in. I put the turkey & veggies in, mixed the soup & milk together and poured that over the turkey & veggies.  I used store bought refrigerated pie crusts to make it super easy.  I also used an egg wash on the crust to make it nice and golden brown.  \n\nI plan to use this recipe on a regular basis.  Delicious homemade pot pie!  Thanks so much for the recipe!",
