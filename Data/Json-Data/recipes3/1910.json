Francese (Veal or Chicken) is made with an egg batter, sauteed, and then finished with lemon juice, white wine, and lemon slices.\n\nSecond, the instructions are incomplete, and there's far too much cream.  This is closer to Alfredo and if I saw this on a restaurant menu and got this concoction, I would have sent it back.  Francese is Francese.  I'm a pro, and was rather shocked on this take of the classic dish.",

Well I scaled the recipe to 3 servings for the kids & I (baby had plain chicken egg allergy hubbys at a buisness dinner..lucky dogg!) and I was trying to lower the calories on this so I used fat free evaporated milk for the cream. So as I'm concocting this I realized that it is nothing other than a chicken omelet with milk. While I thought the chicken turned out surprisingly good (with the egg batter) the sauce was....milk & onions. So as I was trying to redeem it I added a splash of lemon juice mistake #1 it sorta curdled & looked wierd. So then I tried to go Alfredo....mistake #2 as it was too late the end result looked like vomit. Hmmm pretty sure I won't be trying this again it's not worth the calories. 3 stars for okay chicken sorry Mike.",
