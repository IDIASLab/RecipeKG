This has more ingredients than my usual sofrito ... https://www.allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/64763669/sofrito/ ... but I was feelin' a bit wild since I had some of that already in the freezer & the peppers had to go one way or another!  First taste was awful.  I considered tossing, but refrig'd & it's now more than just better, it's good.  The noticeable oregano & cumin weren't so noticeable anymore, but it's good regardless. I reduced garlic to 3 cloves.  I'll add some in recipes if it turns out to be too little.  Three just seemed breathtaking.  :D  Alex's Sofrito by SANDRYLO",
