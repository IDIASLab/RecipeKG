Instead of using all powdered sugar, I used 1 cup of powdered and 1 cup of packed brown sugar and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also sifted a little powdered sugar on top after they came out of the oven.  They are rich and sooo good with a tall glass of milk.  Thanks for sharing Charlene.",

I think though that it would taste better with a chocolate cake mix and less sugar, like a cream cheese brownie. To give it more variety, I think I'd add like strawberry jam swirled into the cream cheese, that might taste really good. But it is a very easy dessert, that certainly is a plus.",

My friends who had it before liked the yellow cake better but they still ate them all up! For those who never had it they loved it! I also took out a cup of confectioners sugar because it really is toooo much sugar and believe me you won't notice if you take out a cup. I put a little vanilla instead. Like a teaspoon.
