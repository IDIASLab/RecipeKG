I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery.  I sauteed chopped celery, red onion, chopped garlic, and the mushrooms.  Simmered this in some sherry.  Used cooked chicken thigh since it's a little tastier than chicken breast.  Added a dab of brown mustard and a splash of Worchestshire to the soup mixture.  Used whole wheat spaghetti to add some grain to the recipe.  Also, covered with crushed cracker and drizzed butter as recommended by reviewers for the last 10 minutes.  Yum ... this was delicious!!

(more trouble but worth it) After removing fat skin bones & veggies from the broth I proceeded w/the rest of the recipe exactly as it was (I also cooked the spag. in the same broth).

I did add onion which I cooked with the mushrooms & a small amount of chicken broth & used one can of cream of chicken soup, per batch.  Also, put some toasted sliced almonds on the top along with the cheese.  Added a nice crunch. Everyone raved about this & it was so easy to make ahead of time.  It took about an hour to cook after it was in the frig overnight. I did cover it with foil for the first 1/2 hour & didn't put the cheese & almonds on until the last 15 minutes.  I will make this over & over.",

Made it for a late buffet at a wedding and it was a hit. Thanks for the great recipe. **update - I've made this recipe a lot since my original review and it's still as popular with everyone I make it for. I think the addition of the onions and garlic with the mushrooms makes a big difference in the flavour dept. I've even made it using only 1 can of cream of mushroom and doing a flour and butter roux when saut\u00e9ing the mushrooms and using chicken stock/cooking water for the liquid needed (more heart/renal patient healthy).",
