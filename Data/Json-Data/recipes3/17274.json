The SECRET to this dip being fantastic is: ***HEAT*** this up in the oven about 10-15 minutes & the flavors taste incrediable melted together. I served this with the \"pita chips\" from this site. I think between the pita chips & this dip---this is the BEST appetizer you could ask for. Thank you!",
