So let me first speak on the original recipe... VERY quick & easy! I needed to make a meal that would allow working late for the entire week- one pot charm is what this is all about! But dwindle down the basil measurement. 2 Tbsp is overkill! One does well in accordance with the oregano. And definitely add salt/pepper at the END! The broth adds enough salt as it is. But the one downfall I had l which is why the rating is 4 stars- WAY too much contents for the standard pot size to handle on pressure cooking and WAY too \"watery\" with the liquid content at the end. This is why I ended up modifying. I got the \"BURN\" warning after 4 minutes of the pressure cook. You need the larger size Instant Pot to cater to this recipe. The pot will become too \"full\" to pressure cook as written if you have a smaller version than the maximum size (I have the 6 quart- this recipe needs an 8 quart). Half the recipe if you have less than an 8 quart. With discovering the results I modified this to add in: 1 can corn 1 diced large russet potato 1 can green peas and 1/2 a green bell pepper diced. I also only used 3/4 of the amount of broth called for and used 1.5 lbs of ground beef. Then increased the pasta shells to about 1 cup to accommodate the excess liquid content. Great base! I just prefer more of a thick stew- and the recipe n",
