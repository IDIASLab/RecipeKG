Way wrong...You forgot gin and blue curacao the tequila is optional and your missing the whole reason the drink is called a grateful dead.... Take a pint glass full of ice and add you VODKA GIN WHITE RUM AND TRIPLE SEC fill with SOUR MIX and top with LEMON-LIME SODA... now the most important part...around one half of the rim of the glass pour in a little BLUE CURACAO and the other half pour in a little RASPBERRY LIQUER....the two twist together through the drink creating a tie-die effect hence the name...GRATEFUL DEAD!!!",
