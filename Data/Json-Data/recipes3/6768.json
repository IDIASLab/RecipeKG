The roasted red pepper flavor is enhanced by the balsamic and tomato paste and the cayenne pepper adds just the right amount of kick. My favorite veggies with this dip were blanched snow peas but I almost wanted to just eat this by itself as a soup! As a dip it was a little thin so I'd add a bit of cream cheese to the mix but that is my only suggestion for improvement. This was amazing and I will definitely be making it on a regular basis!",

I substituted garlic powder, because I had no more fresh.  I also used 4 tablespoons of 1/2 fat mayo and left out the sour cream.  It was delicious and easy to make.",

I was out of sour cream, so substituted with cream cheese, but I should have softened it a bit first before putting in the food processor as the dip turned out a little lumpy.  I will definitely use sour cream next time.  I used a jar of roasted red peppers rather than going through the hassle of roasting my own, and on the recommendation of other reviews, I used balsamic vinegar.  I would say the balsamic vinegar is the star 'secret' ingredient as it brings out the best of all the other flavors.  Thank you for sharing, Sarah!",
