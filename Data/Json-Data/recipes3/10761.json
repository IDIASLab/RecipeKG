After adding the barbecue sauce and the other ingredients I felt the liquid needed to be reduced so I let it go without a lid until most of the sauce would stick to the pork. I felt the sauce was a bit sweet so next time I will omit the honey in the sauce as my brand of sauce is already sweet. I also wanted to pump up the flavor a bit and I added 1 tsp. adobo seasoning and 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika to the sauce before I reduced it. I wasn't too sure about the slaw but I have to say it grew on me. The combined flavors of the slaw and the meat complimented each other with the tiny bit of heat and tang of the slaw offsetting a little of the sweetness of the barbecue sauce. I have to say that the BEST part of this recipe is using the Reynolds Slow Cooker Liner! I have a 6 qt. pot and it's very heavy and hard to manage during cleaning. With these liners it's a minor wipe up and clean the lid. I do not want to run out of these little cook's helpers.",

                "reviewBody": "I absolutely loved pulled pork. So I was very excited to try this recipe. I have to admit it wasn't what I expected. I prepared it exactly as written with the exception of not using wheat buns (we do not eat those) and have to rate it at three stars for a few reasons. First the flavor. I of course expected it to be somewhat sweet with the honey added in. It was TOO sweet. Also the amount of barbeque sauce it calls for wasn't nearly enough. My meat definitely wasn't saturated in sauce like the photo provided. I added more directly to my sandwich. Second the slaw. I love slaw as does my kids. But this one was just not good. The honey jalapeno and lime killed the flavor of the cabbage entirely (I like being able to taste the veggies too!) We ended up eating our sandwiches without it after all of us tried the slaw on a test sandwich. Another thing I noticed - the ingredients say 1 teaspoon cumin divided. However in the directions it calls for 2 teaspoons cumin total. I ended up splitting the teaspoon as I rarely ever cook with cumin and didn't want to overdo it (I couldn't taste it so maybe its supposed to be 2 teaspoons.) Lastly a note for people who don't normally cook pulled pork in a slow cooker. There will be a good bit of liquid in the bottom when you pull out the meat. The recipe doesn't state what to do with the liquid. I removed it as it would have been too soupy otherwise. We all finished our sandwiches it wasn't horrible I just wouldn't fix it again.",
