Added a little more olive oil and vinegar after it was refrigerated as the instructions suggested. I will make this again I am already wishing I had brought a bigger bowl for my lunch thanks Anita! I have made this again and also added canned artichokes to the chick pea mixture. I am suprised the vegetarians out there aren't all over this one! very good!",
