One needs to soak the lentils in water half an hour before cooking ( right at the beginning of cooking). I also add all the sour ingredints like chutney vinegar tomato etc. at the last after the lentils have softened. Used crushed sweet mango pickle instead of the chutney. Thanks!!",

I was unable to find mango chutney and simply didn't have time to make it. I did add some diced fresh mango in its place. It was such a small amount that it really disappeared into the dish. I think it could easily be left out and wouldn't be missed. I found that the dish took MUCH longer to cook than indicated - almost 50 minutes to cook the potatoes through. I had to add at least an extra cup of vegetable stock during cooking. The result was delicious. I will make this again!",

Might also add some cumin or coriander for a more full-bodied spice flavor.",
