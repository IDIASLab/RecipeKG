Wrong decision \u2014 it was yummy but too thick after I refrigerated it. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will use the original ratios.  I made two small additions that I will repeat. I added a sprinkling of nutmeg, which added a subtle depth but really wasn\u2019t recognized as nutmeg.  Also  I added a teaspoon or so of quality vanilla. I immediately noticed that the spread tasted a notch more like Nutella.  Overall, this will not fool anyone who is expecting Nutella, but if you like the flavor of tahini, this is scrumptious!   It certainly disappears as quickly as Nutella! And it\u2019s easier than advertised \u2014 it took me only 5-10 minutes to make it!",

I wanted to salvage the rest of it and thankfully found this fantastic recipe. It turned into a happy accident. I will make this a lot! I didn't use any olive oil since my favorite Ziyad brand tahini is already runny and doesn't need refrigeration. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla. Thank you Diana!!",
