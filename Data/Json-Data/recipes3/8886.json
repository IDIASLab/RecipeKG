I started with a little more than that and it still wasn't enough.  I ended up using enough oil to half submerge the slices, and also ended up making the slices only half as thick.  I don't keep buttery crackers in the pantry so I melted a generous amount of butter and mixed it with plain bread crumbs.  If you do use the crackers though, I recommend giving them a good spin through the food processor to get the crumbs nice and small.  My final outcome was quite tasty; served with warm marinara.",
