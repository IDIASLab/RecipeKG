I shouldn't be rating and reviewing it if I changed it but the recipe deserves feedback. I didn't have dried orange peel so I used orange zest; I didn't have minute rice so I used regular brown rice which I cooked in my home made turkey stock. The turkey stock really upped the flavor in the rice. Everything else was as the recipe said. The results were very tasty. The things that needed improvement were the texture of the rice. It was a little gummy I think if I had used the minute rice that would not have been a problem. Maybe the turkey stock added to that texture problem. The other thing is the amount of dried cranberries. I thought that the next time I would reduce the amount. A little too sweet for me. I quadrupled the recipe and took it to a funeral reception. It was very well received many having seconds and several people asked for the recipe.",
