The flavors were pretty good very buttery but the textures were not. The cake base was dry and hard and basically tasted like dry hard compacted overcooked yellow cake.. The buttery top tasted darned good but was sticky and gluey; I am reasonably certain it was baked long enough too. I will not make it again and cannot recommend it to anyone else.",
