I felt bad and thought it would be the good wife thing to end the year with a cooked meal. This is what I came up with:  chicken breast with red grapes and kalamata olives plated with wild brown rice and your favorite vegetable. Sherry may be substituted for the muscat wine.",

The only negative thing I can find to say at all is that I found my chicken got a little dry and tough from being in the pan so long after it was finished cooking to give the sauce time to cook. Still my husband and I just had it for Valentine's dinner with some green beans amandine and roasted herbed potatoes and it was delicious! Thanks!",
