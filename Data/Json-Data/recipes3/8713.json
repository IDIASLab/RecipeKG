I used 4 eggs and chopped bread and butter pickles in place of the relish. I also used half of a large carrot and an extra green onion. I know that straight mayo would not do it for us so I have a standard 'dressing' for salads like this - mixing mayo sour cream and honey mustard significantly thinned with milk and some pickle juice then seasoned to taste. The crunch of the cauliflower and the pickle is what makes the salad for me - none of that mealy potato texture. Plus - at less than half the calories of potato salad you just can't go wrong. Thanks for sharing Rosalie! This is going to be a new standard.",

I had fresh green beans broccoli and cauliflower so i threw them all in the pot and boiled for 10 minutes. I was hoping that the boiling wouldn't make things too wimpy and it did not. Because I had about three times the cups of veggies called for i made the dressing out of about 1/2 cup of relish 1/2 cup of some German mustard and 1/2 cup of Mayo. threw in the eggs and the peeled carrots and this is awesome!
