This turned out pretty good but it could have used more seasoning. Next time I make it I will season the breadcrumbs. If using fresh asparagus as I did, you will need to salt the sauce some to make up for the salt you would have gotten with the canned asparagus. Overall good recipe and one with a pretty presentation.",
