My 4 year old loved it and my husband suggested making another batch and freezing the burritos so we could have them for easy to heat breakfasts. I only made a couple of tweaks and it would have still been delicious without, but I added just a little extra potato and cooked up some breakfast sausages in the pan first and then sliced and added them in at the end. I ate mine without the tortilla and it was still amazing!",
