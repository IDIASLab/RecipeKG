It really was very good and a good alternative to a classic German Lentil soup. The 4 star rating is because the beer I used was a bit too bitter and the next time I will choose another brand. I also suggest to cook up a bit more bacon so you have some to crumble on top when serving. I served it with homemade cornbread which really complimented it well. This is a soup that will help us get through the cold winter!",
