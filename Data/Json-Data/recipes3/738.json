I didn't have cream of tartar so I substituted one tsp of baking powder for the cream of tartar AND the baking soda. I had to add an additional 1 1/4 cup of flour to make it a consistency that would roll OK. (I also threw in a little additional vanilla and confectioner's sugar so it wouldn't throw off the taste too much by adding so much additional flour.) Still all in all a fun cookie for St. Patrick's Day or to celebrate the Irish! I'm considering dipping the bottom of the cookie in chocolate to give it a little more flavor. It's good by itself just a little plain is all.",
