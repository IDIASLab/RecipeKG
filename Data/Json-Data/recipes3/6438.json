The only modifications I made were: Since I'm not a huge fan of bell peppers (unless roasted) so I added just a smidgen of roasted bells peppers and added lots of mushrooms--and instead of adding the carrots salt and paprika toward the end I added them along with the wine and broth section. Also chicken broth works just fine if you don't (or want to use) have beef broth. DON'T LET THE CHOCOLATE SCARE YOU! I made it for my husband as a Father's Day dinner surprise (he loves my traditional southern oxtail recipe) but I wanted to switch things up a bit and celebrate his Puerto Rican heritage. This did the trick! It's a fantabulous recipe that will enliven your taste buds. Kudos jetman!",

Changes I made were:  didnt have any chocolate on hand so I left it out, and I baked it covered in the oven at 325 for three hours. I thickened up the liquid at the end with a bit of corn starch.  Turned out perfectly tender.  Only problem I had was the price of the meat.  It was 5 dollars a pound- for goodness sake it is only a cows tail! I will definately make this again but cut down on the meat to afford it.  Thank you for this great recepie.",

I used half oxtail and half stew meat (total of about 1.5 lbs of both with no changes to other amounts) since I was cooking for several and wasn't sure how everyone felt about oxtail. I also added in potato with the carrot. I'll probably use less meat the next time I do this since the broth ended up reducing a little more than I expected it to. Planning on adding water to the leftovers and restewing. Thanks again for the great receipe!",

I like meat and frequently find that oxtail doesn't provide enough meat for me...so I substitute with 1kg of osso bucco which was absolutely awesome. During the last hour I added 1 cup of barley and a large sweet potato instead of the the two carrots. I also added a couple of tablespoons of corn flour to thicken up the broth. The results were stunning it's the best stew of this type I've ever had I think. Will make again and again and ensure I have cheaper white wine on hand next time (takes a whole bottle!).

The only changes I made were: to put garlic in the olive oil to brown the oxtail and more garlic for the onions afterwards. I also added the paprika at the time I put the wine and beef broth in to start the simmering process. I threw in a bit of saffron too. And I added lots of mushrooms during the last 20 minutes of simmering after the carrots were almost done. The flavor of this dish is suprisingly interesting and exotic.
