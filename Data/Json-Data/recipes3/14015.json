It is also delicious! Even my husband liked it and he is skeptical of new recipes. It has the right amount of sweetness with a good mixture of spices. I reduced the cumin to 1/2 tsp for taste and it was just right for us. I served it with pasta and tossed the pasta in the pan juices before serving. It was also super easy. We will definitely have it again!",
