I wanted to serve it over pasta so I made a few minor adjustments. At the time I added the artichokes (I strongly recommend the marinated ones in the jar because they add so much flavor) I also added a can of diced tomatos. I let that simmer for about 10 minutes while the pasta was cooking. Then I buried the veal back into the sauce and simmered it for another 10 minutes. The veal was so tender. Perfect topped of with locatelli and hot peppers!",
