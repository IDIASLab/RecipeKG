I made this nearly as written, I used gluten free flour and fresh blueberries in place of frozen. The loaf was done at 60 minutes and was moist and lemony delicious. If I were to make this again though I would increase the glaze and probably skip poking with a toothpick. I would also cut the blueberries back a little bit as well. As written the bread is packed with blueberries and they overwhelm the bread a bit.",
