                "reviewBody": "I have used this recipe for 3 years...it always comes out succulent. Even the leftovers are moist days later. I double up oven baking bags to brine overnight in the fridge. (I don't use the oven bags to cook in though.) The meat isn't salty, so don't be afraid to use the full amount of kosher salt. I do flip the bird breast up at the end like the recipe calls for. I follow the recipe with a few tweaks...I add lots of fresh sage inside the cavity (thyme is good but sage smells and tastes like Thanksgiving to me) & sprinkle a little no-salt poultry seasoning on the outside. If I have some fresh yams & apples, I'll chunk up a couple inside the bird too with the other veggies. Be sure to use a good wine that you'd drink. The gravy is to die for. I pureed some of the carrots, onions & celery separately (use a hand blender if you have one or make sure the veggies aren't hot if you use the blender....no apple or yams in the gravy puree) to add to the gravy drippings to taste. I use a grease separator for the drippings and make a roux out of a little of the fat from the top off the drippings to start of the gravy. Resting before you carve is really, really important. The juices go back into the meat. Make your gravy and bake your rolls while it's resting. That way you aren't tempted to carve too soon.  The carcass, leftover veggies & drippings go straight into the pot for day-after Turkey Barley soup that my has become as much of a family tradition as the turkey dinner.",
