I cut the strawberries in quarters but the chunks were just too big. I wound up cutting each quarter into four pieces. I baked one tray for 25 minutes and they are too soft for my liking. I baked the second tray for 27 minutes and the bottoms were just barley starting to brown. I like those much better, soft with a little bit of crispiness to the bottoms. I would make these again.  07-05-20 Update: I stored these cookies in an air tight container and the next day they were completely soft. These are best eaten the same day because they do not keep very well. I have lowered my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars and no, I will not make these again unless they will be eaten the same day.",

The dough did not come together as I thought so I added more cream. I added the berries and the dough still seemed dry, it would not stick together. I added more cream until the dough just came together and it was fine. I also got 19-20 cookies from the batch but I will definitely make these again soon.",
