But with some VERY simple changes this is a solid 5 and I don't want to discourage others from making it by only giving it 3.  Here's what I changed: Saute 1 small, diced onion in 2 Tbsp of butter with 2 tsp minced garlic.  Add thyme (increased to 1 tsp), black pepper (increased to 2 tsp), 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 Tbsp poultry seasoning.  Add this mixture to the soup.  I also decreased the spinach by about 1/2 a cup because there was just SO much spinach in the soup.  After the changes (none of which really change the basic recipe) this soup is PHENOMENAL!!",

I put about 2 tablespoons butter, choppped green onion and some fine chopped bell pepper into pan and cooked to soften.  I then added 2 cans of broth as one was not enough to cook the tortellini.  Fresh spinach was all that I had  on hand, chopped and added near the end to wilt properly.  An extra sprinkle of grated parmesean on serving and a sprinkle of garlic croutons.  This one is definitely a good base that can go in many directions.",

I searched for a \"canned chicken breast\" recipe and got this recipe which called for \"canned chicken broth\" and \"canned cream of chicken soup\".  I still went with the canned chicken breast, which shortened my cooking time by about 15min.  I also used dry packaged tortellini instead of refrigerated, because the dry 12oz package was .99cents and I got more tortellini. The dry tortellini required double the amount of chicken broth so that it could cook for 15min.  I used fresh spinach leaves out of a bag found in the salad section.  I loved this soup! Try it tonight!!",

Then I added this mixture to the soup. I also used about 10oz of fresh spinach which I think gave it a fresh taste and was not an over abundance of spinach.
