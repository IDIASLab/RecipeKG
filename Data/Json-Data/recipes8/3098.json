                "reviewBody": "Sopa de Tortilla is one of my favorite soups.  It is reminiscent of my time in Mexico City where it is very common.   Unfortunately, this version just didn't do it for me...the classic original version is made with freshly made chicken stock and chipotle peppers.  I was looking for a version that eliminated this step and lessen the time it takes to make it.  The lack of chicken stock wasn't the main dissapointment, rather the use of parsley instead of cilantro. This just ruined the soup's flavor into something unrecognizable to me and it no longer felt like I was having \"Sopa de Tortilla\". It wasn't bad, it just no longer tasted like Tortilla Soup.  It probably wouldn't be so bad if I had used cilantro instead.  \n\n\nAnother missing star due to the broth missing  a noticeable \"key\" ingredient that traditional Tortilla Soup is most famous for, which are,  chipotle peppers. This is where Tortilla Soup gets it's smokyness and depth from.   I added this in to get a more authentic flavor that I'm familiar with.",
