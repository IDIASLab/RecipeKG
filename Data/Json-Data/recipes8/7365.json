We dislike mayo and all its varients, so my version was made with greek yogurt and sour cream. I made my sauce up separately and found it a bit bland, so I also added dijon mustard and regular, a touch of balsmic vinegar, a bit of brown sugar (1/4 cup or so), and paprika. I also used more bacon than this called for (because who doesn't like bacon?). It was excellent. I sliced extra egg on top, and sprinked it with paprika, extra bacon and peas. It was very pretty. Wish I'd taken a picture! I served it to 6 adults and 6 kids. Even the two who \"hate\" potato salads loved it.  It made enough to feed everyone as a side to burgers (with extra helpings) and we had enough leftover to feed my family of 4 as a side with lunch the next day.",

This recipe met that criteria and with the addition of bacon, which as the saying goes makes everything better, I believed I had it nailed. Not.  I liked it \u2013 I liked it a lot. I didn\u2019t know why Hubs wasn\u2019t fond of it.  His reason never would have occurred to me.  Potato salad of this type shouldn\u2019t have skin on it.  I won\u2019t make this again, not because it wasn\u2019t good, but because Hubs didn\u2019t like it and I\u2019m not a huge fan of potato salad in general.  The bottom line? If you like skin-on potato salad, this is a solid performer. If you don\u2019t like it, peel the darn things.",
