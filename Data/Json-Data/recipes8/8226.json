The only issue I had was with the phyllo dough. I kept a damp towel over it to keep it from drying out between rolling, but, I still had some issues with the thin layer breaking as I brushed butter on it and rolled. If you haven\u2019t worked with phyllo before it is very important to keep the phyllo covered with a damp towel between working with the sheets. If it dries out it becomes very brittle. Thank you for the recipe!",
