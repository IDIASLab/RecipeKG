There is a lot of liquid, and when I saw how much of the sauce there was I knew there was no way this was fitting in an 8 in. baking dish.  I made it in a deep 9x13 pan and it barely fit.  I did modify a bit:  used ricotta cheese instead of cottage so it was less watery; added 1 chopped jalape\u00f1o to the sauce for a little more flavor and a bit of spice; did not have tomatoes with cilantro and lime so juiced 1/2 lime and chopped some cilantro into the sauce; and definitely need more than 5 tortillas, especially since it needs to go into a bigger dish. It has very good flavor, but the tortillas actually kind of disintegrate so you don't really have layers at the end.",
