And don't let the name fool you, we're not going to need to pull any chicken, since as you'll see, it actually pulls itself. Garnish these with more green onion if desired.",

This will be a go-to now since I keep frozen chicken thighs and everything else is typically in my pantry anyways. Bravo Chef John, you never miss.",
