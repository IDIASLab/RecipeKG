I seasoned the chicken with fajita spice (made the mistake of not adding salt - the chicken really needs 1/2 tsp salt). I was worried that the peppers would make it too hot (used 1/2 the amount) - next time I would use all the peppers.  I roasted and peeled the poblano peppers - before adding them - they added incredible flavor. I used jalapeno jack and cheddar cheese - and reduced the amount by half. Since I left out 1/2 the cheese the result was bordering on being dry.  Next time I would increase the amount of sauce.  The sauce was great with that hint of lime, but it needed 1/2 tsp of salt too. (Maybe reducing the cheese makes this recipe in need of salt?) The mushrooms didn't add much and I don't really think of them as fitting in a Mexican style dish - I'd leave them out next time. Lastly, for ease of serving I cut the tortillas into squares and lined the pan.  Dad and 2 kids gave thumbs up, and ate it with green tomatillos sauce.",

I've made this many times for company and friends and have always gotten requests for the recipe.  I do put in more poblanos (4-6), doubled the sauce, used 1/2 bunch cilantro, skipped the mushrooms since I don't like them, and added salt.  I have made this with both flour and corn tortillas and prefer the corn with this recipe.  Hope this helps.  Enjoy.",

I had to season the chicken a little.  I used cumin and garlic powder.  I added half a jar of salsa verde to the chicken and peppers.  I didn't add the mushrooms - they didn't really seem like they belonged. I only used half a bunch of cilantro and I'm glad I did.  It added great flavor to the sauce, but it was a little overpowering.  Next time I will double the sauce to put it in both layers, but still only use half the cilantro.  Don't be afraid to use all the peppers.  I like spicy food and was afraid it would be too spicy, but it wasn't.  We'll definitely make it again. ",
