If you like beef stew, and you're a fan of chili, you're going to go nuts over this. Serve with lime wedges as-is, or with warm flour tortillas, chili oil, salsa, or diced avocado next to some Spanish rice and a nice green salad.",

I took the meat out and pulled it apart, then cooked down the sauce a bit more (30mins-1 hour) and put the meat back in the sauce to heat back up. Then served in the sauce to be put directly on tacos. Super jucy meat and so delicious. Great recipe!",

Paired it with a nice Malbec from Argentina.  A++++++ stew.  I'm definitely making the tacos with the leftovers.",
