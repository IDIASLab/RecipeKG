Firstly, I chopped the mint before adding it to the sugar/lime mixture to pull out more of the flavor, then I strained the pieces out (I liked the taste it imparted, but fresh mint leaves are fairly bitter. Chewing on them in your salad can be unpleasant).\n\nSecondly, I'd definitely add another teaspoon of sugar if you're making it for a mixed group (in other words, people who may not like mojitos). In my opinion, that takes it from the realm of \"this made the fruit taste like a mojito\" to \"this tastes like a yummy fruit salad.\" I'd strongly suggest tasting the dressing before adding it and adjusting the amounts to your preference, how sour your limes were, and so on.",

I used the tips given by others I chopped the mint (a lot more than 3 sprigs!) and muddled it with 1 tablespoon sugar then squeezed the juice of 2 limes over. I let it stand while I prepared the fruit then strained it over the fruit pressing hard on the solids. It was refrigerated all day while I went to the movies with my book club friends then served at the after-movie discussion. Everyone raved about how good it was and it was gone before the end of the evening. I think this would good with just about any fruit so it would be something that could be served any time of year.
