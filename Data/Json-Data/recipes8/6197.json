I brought these last night to a picnic and they were a hit! There were none left and I made about 50 of them! I bought everything from Trader Joes-a pack of basil, sweet cherry tomatoes, and mozzarella  balls that came in a container with an olive oil/herb marinade. I assembled these like this picture and since the balls were already in a marinade I just spooned a tiny bit of the marinade left in the container over the entire plate! Then I sprinkled a tiny bit of salt and cracked pepper. Also, I used the rest of the basil to cover the plate before arranging these. It's a beautiful presentation! A must have for parties, picnics, wherever!!",

The brand I chose was completely flavorless. I can halve a bigger ball but it's hard to add flavor to flavorless mozzarella.;o) Like so many reviewers I used the vinegar & oil as a marinade instead of as a dip. Don't skimp on the salt! I think next time I'll either put a little bowl of salt out to roll the tomatoes in or I'll serve the bites on a bed of kosher salt. Great appetizer for a fettucine alfredo dinner...thanks! SiNsGirl's pic is superb so I saved myself the embarassment of posting a pic. LOL Great job SiNsGirl!",
