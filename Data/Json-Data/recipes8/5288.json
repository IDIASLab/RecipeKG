They very much taste like what they are baked cashew butter with some added ingredients for texture. It's like peanut butter but much more mild. I followed the recipe exactly except I made my own cashew butter in my Vitamix machine. My cashews were salted which I thought would work well. It appears every Paleo recipe I have tested doesn't seem to have salt. I think they probably needed it even if it is not paleo friendly. I got 14 cookies using a standard cookie scoop. Edit note: Although I thought they were allright no one else would eat them. They thought they were too doughy and heavy. They are on board with the light texture of flour that nuts made into butter apparentely are just missing.",
