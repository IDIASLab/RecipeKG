I also sprinkled them with red pepper flakes after they were in the cake pan because I wanted them to have some kick (they are devils after all). They take a little while to put together but they cook up quickly and they're REALLY good. My buddy who was over to watch football loved them as did my girlfriend's buddy who was over to get her hair done. If you want something tasty and impressive and you don't mind taking a little time to make them these are awesome. I think I'm gonna make a super spicy batch for Halloween.:)",
