Then I added in a clove of minced garlic (which I left in there). Once that was done, I added in the block of cream cheese and melted it in. I then added in the milk and combined until smooth. I added the parm to thicken and at the end, I added a box of frozen peas that I had cooked. Heated it all through and seasoned with pepper and a little dried basil (it's all I had)...YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! I served this over wagon wheel shaped pasta for something fun. I LOVED the ease of this recipe, and the outcome was nothing short of DELICIOUS! The beauty of this recipe is that it is so versatile and pretty much anything you like can be added. I will definately be making this often (I'm an alfredo addict, lol)! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I omitted mushrooms (don't care for them) but when the sauce was complete I spooned it over rigatoni(I didn't have farfalle or linguine) chopped broiled chicken breast and steamed broccolli. Yes it is a little rich but worth the splurge! Plus if you are calorie conscious you shouldn't be trying this one anyway? Some italian bread rolls finished it off perfectly! Thanks for the recipe!
