I\u2019m not convinced that it needs 6 hours in the slow cooker, then refrigerated overnight, and reheated in the slow cooker for an hour the next day.   I slow-cooked it today, we ate it today, and it was very good!  Slow cooking may be a convenience for some, but I think cooking stovetop or even baking in the oven also would be fine.  I did omit the liquid smoke which we don\u2019t care for.  Terra, thanks for sharing your recipe.",

Made it for a friend's surprise birthday party/barbecue, and the recipe was requested by several.  I followed the instructions to a 'T' .  My only comment other than accolades is that I don't think 6 hours in the crockpot is necessary.  Mine became mushy and, like another reviewer, they were somewhat dry and I had to add more bbq sauce/ketchup/water.  I wondered if, in fact, the oven baking might not be better.  That being said, who wants to heat up the kitchen in the summer? BTW, this recipe freezes beautifully!  Thanks, Terra, for sharing.",
