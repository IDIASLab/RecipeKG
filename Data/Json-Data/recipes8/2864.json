A couple of things to note 1) I cooked the chicken in a dutch oven (filled with water) and used the broth from the chicken to thin the mole paste while blending. 2) I added 1/2 tsp of cloves and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the onions and garlic. I mixed the mole sauce and the chicken together at the end and simmered for 20 minutes. My sauce came out really thick---just how my family likes it----but the pieces of chicken didn't hold together well. Next time I will remove the chicken from the dutch oven after it is cooked set aside and cook the mole sauce in the remaining broth. Will probably serve by pouring the sauce over the piece of chicken. Will definitely cook again and probably play with the spices a little more maybe add more toasted cloves. Thanks for a great recipe!",
