Once you've made this, you will never go back to canned or boxed again. With the help of your Instant Pot&reg;, you can make this in a fraction of the time it would take to do it in a slow cooker.",

You can get a decent stock with as little as 90 min, but I generally give it 2 hours. Based on this recipe I'll try 3 hrs this week and see if it makes an appreciable difference. The flavour is immeasureably better than any grocery store offering and having it always available has vastly improved my soups, gravies and sauces.",
