Picked the crust off, and tried to scoop the balls.  But they had a very poor texture, part creamy, part hard, and I ended up having to reblend the whole cooked cheesecake, which I then put back in the fridge.  The melon-baller wouldn't work because of the blending, so I had to form the balls by hand, which was a mess.  It worked out and tasted good, but I added a lot of extra work and stress, and I was haunted by the idea that they could have been much better than they were (even though they were a big hit). I am here to tell you, do not over-bake the cheesecake!!",

Made prep time so much easier and everyone loved that they could have there own favorites without having to make twenty different cheesecakes.  Thanks so much for the post. ",

I had white chocolate on some of the cheesecake balls and milk chocolate on others and my favorite was the white chocolate balls dipped in the raspberry preserves. YUM!! I will definately make these again but only for special occasions.",

All in all an amazingly clever recipe but definitely very very time consuming. This is a 2 day project but would be perfect for kids to help. I dipped some in crushed Butterfinger Heath Bar and Snickers. I don't reccomend the snickers so much b/c of the caramel but any other hard candy bar would work great. Thanks for the recipe!",
