Chicken thighs are a lot smaller and need to be cooked on lower heat. (BTW-The recipe DOES state to remove the bone). I made this almost as is except for the addition of re-constituted chopped sun-dried tomatoes that I happened to have on hand to the stuffing mixture. I also did not use dried mushrooms and as a consequence substituted veggie stock for the reserved mushroom stock in the recipe. Perfect recipe. Even my 7 year old loved it.",

My hubby said the cheese wasn't too goaty and the mushrooms weren't too strong - it was a nice balance. I would also recommend removing the bone - it's so much easier to eat. The biggest problem I had with this recipe is that well before the chicken was done the skin burnt where it had been stuffed. I will definitely make this or a slight variation again but I think it has to be covered until the last 5-10 minutes to prevent the skin from burning. 4 stars as written 5 stars if the skin didn't burn",

I never cook skin-on breasts so I cut pockets and stuffed the mixture inside the breasts. I didn't use the food processor; I cut the mushrooms by hand. I had some left over so I added it to the sauce I made from the pan drippings. This was AMAZINGLY good and I didn't tweak the recipe itself really at all.
