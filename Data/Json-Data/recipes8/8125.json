This authentic dish is made with tomatoes and onions flavored with the aromas of the Indian spices. This is cherished with phulka (roti, Indian wheat bread). There are various versions of aloo gobi, this is my take on it. Please do try this recipe and comment. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve with a lemon wedge. Serve with hot phulka or chapati or rice and curds.",
