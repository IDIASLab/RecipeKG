The recipe author commented that you could cut back the salt and MSG so I reduced the salt since the recipe also includes olives (just personal taste preference) but left the MSG amount as indicated. I think the addition of the fresh lemon juice and seasoned salt (instead of regular salt) to the dressing really enhances this pasta salad and I like the variety of all the veggies. The tri-color rotini and all of the different ingredient colors give lovely presentation as well lots of eye appeal. We like pasta salad and this is a good one.",
