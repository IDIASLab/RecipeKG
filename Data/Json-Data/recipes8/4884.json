Also I added mine to the crockpot to slow cook for the day after the initial browning and boiling. The smell is amazing never thought I would rave so much about the beer in the stew but its incredible with such a distinctive taste. You could really experiment with any strong flavorsome beer. Bought some crusty french stick bread to serve with it and added a handful of chopped corriander before serving. What a hit! boys loved it!",

Used 1 1/2 sweet onion cut in chunks; half a bag of baby carrots; no celery root or turnip; one bottle of Guinness beer added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes about 1/2 cup of quick cooking barley (added the last 1/2 hour of cooking) and used some Montreal Seasonings. I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dry and added it when browning the veggies and then a bit more to the stew itself. Did use fresh rosemary at the end. I think the key is to season each layer and gradually build up the taste. Thank you so much for posting this!",

This one is more labor-intensive than that and I was getting kind of bummed because I really had other things to do that day than fuss with dinner. I'm so glad I hung in there though! This was just the absolute best!!! I won't say that I wouldn't try to cut or combine a few of the steps to see if it makes any difference but I'll tell you what...if it DOES I will go right back to this one and stop whining!

I discovered the secret to tender beef is letting it cook for the full duration - I've had stew in the past where the beef is dry and tasteless and tasting this recipe throughout the process I found that the beef was wonderful after browning but then got tough when first boiled in the beer. The subsequent cooking allowed it to reabsorb the moisture from the stew and become tender again. I used Shipyard Brewer's Brown Ale which had a very robust malty flavor and made a gorgeous brown gravy. Delicious!",

Pearl onions are a pain and expensive I use diced onions and detect no difference. I used regular mushrooms as a cost saver and again no discernible difference. And most effective for me to save time after browning the meat I placed it in a pressure cooker with the celery root and turnips and carrots and broth for 10 minutes under pressure. Then back to the pot with it all and add the beer. I also used 1 T worcestershire sauce and 1 T double strength tomato paste to add to the glutamates and boost the beef flavor and I used small red potatoes so I didn't have to dice them.",
