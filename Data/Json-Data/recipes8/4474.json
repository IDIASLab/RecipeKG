Once in the roasting pan and once after you add cream to the saucepan will keep it from going mushy. 2) A little butter and a crushed clove of garlic added to the roasting pan deepens the flavor. 3) Don't let the cream fritter away in the saucepan or the squash/sausage mix will turn to stew and you won't have enough sauce for the penne. 4) You might not even need the pasta - the mix is that good. This is a very tasty restaurant-quality recipe and the slight drizzle of balsamico adds subtle sparkle to the flavor. An Excellent dish - I'll make it again and again.",

I added about 5 cloves of garlic to the cookie sheet before roasting the squash. While the squash and garlic were roasting I caramelized 1 medium onion in about 2 tbsp of butter. Please note that I omitted the balsamic vinegar completely from this recipe but I did use dried sage since I didn t have fresh on hand. After the turkey sausage was completely cooked I kept the flame on medium-low and added the caramelized onions to the pan then added about cup of chicken broth cup half and half cup of fresh grated parmesan and Romano cheese and a dash of dried rosemary. I stirred this quite frequently. When the squash and garlic were done I added them to the sausage and onion mixture being careful not to stir too vigorously so the squash cubes would remain intact. I used fresh linguine instead of penne and as soon as the pasta was cooked I drained it and poured the sausage mixture over it in a wide pasta bowl. For a finishing touch I tore bits of fresh basil and tossed it on top. My husband and 7 year daughter devoured it! Take a look at my photo of this lovely dish! It was very flavorful. I may make it again using pork sausage!",

They carmelized nicely and the squash held its shape well.I also added some fresh sage to the sautee.
