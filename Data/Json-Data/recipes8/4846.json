I've used pollock when I didn't have tilapia and even served it over plain pasta when I didn't have mizithra cheese. I've substitued canned mushrooms canned diced tomatoes and lemon juice from a bottle. I've added zucchini basically substitute and use whatever is on hand. Very versatile dish! FYI - I just had to register in order to give the first review on this recipe. I've used this site since 2002 and my husband wanted mizithra pasta like the Old Spaghetti Factory. I tried this dish to use my leftover cheese and wanted to give credit to this recipe.",

I allowed each half to cool and then scarped the spaghetti squash out into a bowl. I then sauteed the squash in 3 tablespoons of butter and then added Mizithra cheese. My husband and I absolutely inhaled it!",

I'm not sure what the mizithra adds bc I've never had it and didn't have it on hand for this dish. I used a very sharp chedder and crumbled it over the top and that worked well enough. I left out the mushrooms but otherwise left in the rest of the ingredients. I'm a bit confused by the garlic--it's in the ingredients but not in the directions (unless I'm blind always a distinct possibility) so I just added the garlic at the halfway point when I flipped the tilapia. It's not my favorite tilapia dish--more bc I love bold flavors--but it was nice to try. Thanks for the recipe!",
