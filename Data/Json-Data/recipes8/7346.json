Since 1/2 cup of half-and-half was going into the recipe later the first thing I did was cook the starter sauce down quite a bit and then add the chicken and ravioli. Next I added a good handful of parmesan to the sauce which GREATLY improved the flavor and thickened the sauce. Out of the can the sauce was pretty bland thin and really lacking basil flavor. I used fresh bacon and boneless chicken breast and FF half-and-half. The cooking method ultimately resulted in a pretty flavorful sauce and we were happy with the meal but it took a lot more than 20 minutes to get it on the table.",

It was a rough evening when I made this I had 2 kids that needed to be picked up from activities open house and a parents meeting that I had forgotten about. Luckily I had everything for this on hand so I thought I'd try it since its so quick. I used frozen ravioli I think it was an 11 oz package homemade bacon bits and leftover cooked chicken. Dumped it all in the pan and let it simmer until it was done. I didn't use the full amount of half-and-half just slowly added until it was the right consistency for out tastes. Also threw in some fresh grated Asiago cheese. I didn't have any fresh basil or parsley on hand so I topped with some green onion. Tasty the family liked it and it was a dinner saver on a really hectic night. I would make this one again.",

I was a bit concerned about the thickness of the sauce but I let it simmer for a bit and then added a handful of cheese. Next time I think I will try it with the ravioli!",
