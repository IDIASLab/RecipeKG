The only changes I made was to make more of the paste (first time I made it I felt like I could not taste the seasonings that well) also instead of chili powder I used onion steak burger seasoning. (It's my go to spice) Added some garlic powder and along with the shaker parm we put in a little bit of grated real parm that we had left over. We also had to up the time to 30 mins. That is perfect for us. Also because of reviews.....we used non stick aluminum foil so no problems with any of the coating coming off!!",
