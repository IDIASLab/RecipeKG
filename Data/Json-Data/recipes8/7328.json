The changes I made:  increased the red onion to 1 cup (because my man and I love it!), used half regular mayo and half light, used light sour cream, added 1 T of garlic salt (I find that the light mayo needs a bit more salt than the regular kind), and a heaping T of minced garlic.  I used all regular bacon, but after trying this once - and being HIGHLY successful! - I think I could have gone with half turkey bacon and cut the fat down more.  I think I also could have used less regular mayo and more light.  Amazing what you can do with red potatoes! This recipe is a major keeper, congrats, Old Crow!!!!",

I did make a few changes: I used mircle whip instead of mayo because we rarely have mayo in the house (we just prefer mircle whip) I used cheddar cheese instead of American because that's what I had on hand that needed to be used anyway and instead of mixing the bacon in with the potoato mixture I sprinkled them on top and smothered a bit of the potato \"sauce\" on top of the bacon before adding the parm. cheese. It's been my experience that baking bacon in with a dish makes the bacon very gooey and not crispy which is how I like it. The only thing I will do different next time is cut up the potatoes a little smaller. I cut them into approx. 1/4\" slices then across four times each and I think they'd be better a little smaller but that's just personal perference. I will definately make this again.",

I was making it for my whole family so I used 5 lbs of potatoes and 48 slices of American cheese as well as about 2 cups of sour cream and instead of bacon (since i did not have any) I used Turkey Sausage (1 lb) My whole family DEVOURED them (3 sons and a husband) And I had leftovers that were gone by the next day!! To make the mixing of the ingredients easier and more equal I put it in my blender a little at a time to really grate up the slices of cheese well and mixed well throughout. This is a great recipe. I will make it again but it sure is fattening so it will be a SPECIAL OCCASION dish. Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe!!!!",
