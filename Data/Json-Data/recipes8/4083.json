Light, fluffy, and tasty. I did follow some advice from other reviewers. I changed the floor quantities to; 1-1/2 cup of almond flour and 1/2 cup of tapioca flour. I also mixed all wet ingredients in one bowl and all dry ingredients in another then poured the wet ingredients over the dry and whisked together just enough so it\u2019s blended and still on the runny side. Oh! And now for the best deviation, I lightly folded in some frozen blueberries because, well they are tasty. Topped with some maple syrup.My hats off to the author for a great pancake recipe.
