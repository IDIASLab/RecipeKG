I found a recipe on this site that pairs very well with this one Korean BBQ Sauce by holmes416. Toss in some sesame seeds for extra flavor. The fruit/veggie combo was fantastic no peaches at the market so I used an orange bell along with the red bell mango and pineapple. There was nothing but sweet Mmmm's as we all savored this nice meal served with rice. Thanks Tara we'll be grilling this one all summer long.",
