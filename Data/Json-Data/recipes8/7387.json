As things worked out we weren't able to go out. Since I was still craving that sinful appetizer and my homemade chips aren't always scrumptious, it dawned on me why not use store-bought kettle-cooked chips and top them! This was the perfect way to indulge in my loaded chip craving.",

I used a whole bag of kettle cooked sea salt and cracked pepper chips so I didn't measure any of the other ingredients but I did use them all including some shredded mozzarella that I had to use up and aside from the sour cream b/c I served these w/ Semigourmet's personal recipe for 'buttermilk ranch' which was fantastic w/ these. We literally licked the plate clean lol. We already can't wait to make these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
