I too was challenged finding the elusive seafood stock and tomato powder (I checked two different stores) so subbed chicken broth and tomato paste. Otherwise followed exactly and it was an impressive meal! Makes a LOT - including the sauce so I am glad I served over rice AND had some toasted French bread to help clean my plate up! Otherwise would have had to lick clean! Thanks for this to-be-repeatable recipe!!",
