Almost the same just sans almond extract plus some cocoa powder. It came out lovely. I done have an electric mixer and it wasn\u2019t a problem. I also doubled the recipe in order to make a two layer version. I would say putting the cakes in the freezer for half an hour and lining the pan with coconut oil definitely helps when trying to get it out of the cake pan. I love this recipe it\u2019s absolutely yummy and works well (especially for a novice like myself.)",
