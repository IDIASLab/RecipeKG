        "description": "These soft, slightly sweet sugar cookies have the flake and softness of a scone or a biscuit. They're just the right level of sweetness without being overkill. According to Alzina Toups, a chef who specializes in Cajun cuisine, before heading back to the oyster reef during the long cold winters, oystermen from Lafourche Parish would take pillowcases full of these sweet cookies to remind them of home. They were meant to survive the cold and the moisture on the reefs so the texture is a cross between a sugar cookie and hard tack. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.",
