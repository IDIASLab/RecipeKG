I used a chili garlic sauce and rice vinegar. Lemon basil is a nice touch little lighter than regular basil with that lemony undertone. Eating tomato and melon together was a little weird for me but it works well together. It was definitely spicier the next day for the chili sauce. Thanks for the recipe!",
