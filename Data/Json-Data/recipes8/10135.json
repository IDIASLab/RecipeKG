It was on the bland side and could have benefited from some seasoning other than salt, pepper, parsley and whole roasted garlic. If I were to make again I would not leave the garlic whole but would mince it. This is good as a base but needs some tweaks to make it great. *note parsley added after pic was taken.",

(The original dish only has salt and pepper, with garlic and lemon being the only other flavors.)\n\nThe instructions could have been a bit clearer.  I did it as close to how they intended as I could.\n\nFirst, I browned the chicken as directed. And once browned, I set them aside.\n\nThen, in the same pan, I browned the potatoes, lemon slices, and garlic together until they had a good brown.\n\nI applied salt and pepper to the above (chicken too) while cooking, as directed.\n\nAt this point I deviated a bit.  I added cumin and coriander and some red chili flakes to the veggie mix.  I then put them in the baking pan, spread even... with the chicken on top.\n\nI dusted the chicken with a bit of cumin and coriander as well.\n\nRoasted at the temperature and time as suggested.\n\nWhen it was done I topped with cilantro (the recommended alternative) - for more flavor (rather than regular parsley).\n\nIt came out FANTASTIC.\n\nThe added cumin, coriander, and chili flakes gave it the flavor and zing it needed.\n\nI will say that the lemon slices are critical to this dish.  They need to have a good brown on them prior to putting them in the oven.\n\nLemon, cumin, and coriander are traditional in middle eastern cooking and often used together - this dish was made for those ingredients.\n\nWill be adding this to my bi-weekly meals.  (So easy too!)",
