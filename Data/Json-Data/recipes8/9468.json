This version of Instant Pot oatmeal is a pot-in-pot pressure cooker oatmeal recipe. This recipe will yield oatmeal with a firm texture (since that's how our family likes it). For softer, mushier oatmeal, increase the pressure cook time by 1 minute.",

No watching it for boil overs, set it and go about your morning. If you don't like the maple/brown sugar idea, you can sub for other flavors or just cook the oats plain and doctor them up after they're in your bowl. Store leftovers in the fridge, carefully reheat with extra milk or cream.",
