                "reviewBody": "Just wanted to post a comment about this recipe. I've raised cattle made my share of rib roasts and am an experienced cook. My only fault with this recipe is if you roast this to 135 degrees coupled with letting it rest after removal from the oven which is a must your roast will not be medium rare. Carry over cooking time can add an additional 8-12 degrees to the roast. so what you will end up with is a medium to medium well done piece of meat. Nothing wrong with that if that's the way you like it. We like our beef rare so I set my probe thermometer at 119 degrees and with carry over cooking it rises to 129-132 degrees just the way we like it. Hope this helps",
