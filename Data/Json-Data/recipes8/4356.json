I used about half frozen and half canned corn because that's what I had; rice vinegar in lieu of white wine vinegar; lemon concentrate and omitted the seafood seasoning. My BF didn't care for it but one of my guests really enjoyed it. I also let it sit in the warm oven before serving. Fancy corn!!",

You need to be a tarragon lover (I am) because that\u2019s the dominant flavor with a punch of sweetness from the corn.  In this house, I\u2019d serve this as either a side dish or just scoop it onto some lettuce for a salad and add a few croutons.  Would make again.",
