Also, adjusting it slightly on the time. Closer to 28/29m before squash and zucchini, then 11/12m after.\n\nSatisfying, pretty healthy, pretty easy, and leftovers are pretty reheat friendly.\n\nFor sure going to cook it again, I\u2019ve got some thoughts about ways to add teriyaki sauces, maybe even try going in a more BBQ direction.",
