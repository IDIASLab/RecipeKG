        "description": "Shrimp is one of my favorite weeknight meals, because it is so quick to prepare! The Cuban-style marinade is full of citrus flavors with a few surprises. Normally, \"mojo\" means a flavor based on Seville oranges, and these sour oranges can be hard to find. A bit of extra lime, some grapefruit juice, and vinegar stand in for the brightness of the missing Seville oranges in this recipe. The red pepper flakes add just a little zing, so if you like spicy foods, feel free to add more, to your taste. We like this with simple white rice and some black beans, or a side of grilled mixed veggies.",

Bibi, the tang from the citrus juices is spot on and enhanced by the subtle warmth from the red pepper flakes and cumin.  I kept all ingredients as written, but used only half a pound of shrimp for the two of us. After reducing the marinade/sauce, I threw in the shrimp to warm and served it over jasmine rice. DE-LISH! Thank you, my friend, for a winning recipe!",
