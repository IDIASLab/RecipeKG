I thought they were way too sweet, which isn't saying much because I find everything too sweet---but even my sweet-toothed, puts-sugar-on-his-sugar husband said they were too sweet. And the predominate flavor in the bars, other than sweet, was simply of baked jam, and not a lot else. It's shocking that the chocolate didn't come through at all (except for what's drizzled on top). I think maybe these could be tweaked to suit our tastes more (i.e. less sugar, more cocoa, less jam, maybe some fresh raspberries and chopped dark chocolate added to the filling), but I don't know that I'd make them again. Sorry!",
