I seasoned everything with thyme, seasoned salt, and added some garlic salt to the chicken.  I cooked it at 425 degrees for 35 minutes, and it was perfect!  I forgot to use a non-stick spray on the foil, but it didn't need it, as the butter in the sauce made sure nothing stuck.  I'll definitely be making this again.",
