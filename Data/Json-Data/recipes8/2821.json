If you make a sandwich or a wrap you don't really use more than an ice cream scoop or about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup.... this makes much much MUCH more than that! Reason #2 is the 2 hr 45 min prep time.... I'm sorry but this took me ALL AFTERNOON! (Not that I mind cooking all afternoon but let's be real!) There are 3 major steps to this recipe that each take a fair amount of time.... maybe in a restaurant kitchen things move faster than in my kitchen..... That being said the taste is wonderful! Be sure to use mayonnaise and NOT Miracle Whip (no matter how much you like it better) or you will end up with a very sweet dish. Also I would advise you to line the roasting pan with foil and give it a light cooking oil spray.. otherwise your veggies WILL stick. Next time I will cook the corn but not roast it because it gets too hard. Put the roasted poblanos in a double plastic bag to cool.... it will make the skins much easier to get off. Be brave and give this a try.... it's worth it in the long run.",

I made a few minor changes to tailor it to my familiy tastes: I used anaheim peppers (its what I had on hand) and skipped the celery. When I pureed the mayonnaise and peppers - I added 1/2 of the onion/bellpepper mix to this and blended it in as well - it added a nice extra depth to the dressing flavor. We didn't need salt or pepper. We prefer our chicken salad chunky so I chopped up the chicken and mixed it the remaining onion/bellpepper blend and dressing together in a large bowl and refrigerated it! We ate ours as wraps wtih lettuce tomato an jalapeno slices!",

I had no mayo so I made my own and I added a few of the poblano seeds so that it was a bit more spicey. I also had no fresh red peppers on hand so I used some red peppers I had sliced and froze! I also never had fresh corn so I used frozen corn. My kids even liked it!!! Made WAY too much for what we need or will eat so we'll be gifting the neighbours with chicken salad lol.
