These ingredients are so simple with stuff you probably already have.  I didn't give 5 stars because I think it needs a few more herbs.  I didn't measure, but I'm sure I used more salt, pepper and paprika than in the recipe.  It was like a tasty chicken stew.  I will definitely make again.  Maybe add oregano next time?
