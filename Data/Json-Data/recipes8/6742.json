While I love it served fresh and hot, a good next-day meatloaf sandwich is also a comfort food. I serve it with a nice arugula salad with cherry tomatoes, raisins, chopped walnuts, and vinaigrette dressing, or for a southern flare--garlic-smashed potatoes and freshly steamed snap green beans. Just yummy deliciousness and mum is always right!",
