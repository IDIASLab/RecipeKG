So I pureed it and after doing so I allowed the solids to settle and then poured off the water. It worked great! Instead of yogurt and cream I used homemade strawberry ice cream. I left out the orange juice because to be honest I think its flavor is too bold and detracts from other flavors. I forgot to add the vanilla but I didn t miss it. Since I had neither the water from the watermelon nor the orange juice I added half-and-half to compensate. This was wonderful. Hubs couldn t put his finger on what was in it and called it almost like fruit punch. (Did I mention I threw in some frozen raspberries with this too?) I liked this more than most I ve made which frankly are getting kind of boring.",

This is a perfect way to get rid of leftover fruit especially those pieces that are still good to eat but don't look pretty enough to go into fruit salads etc. I also used lemon juice as others suggested and instead of plain yogurt (we never have plain in this house) I used all cream although next time I will just use all parts milk for less calories. The other thing I would say is give this a good taste test before serving because its all going to depend on your fruit whether it needs more or less sugar. Mine needed a tad more sugar. Last thing is don't let the 1 serving thing fool you. With that \"one serving\" I had enough for me my husband and my toddler!",
