And if you're looking for new ways to prepare lean, cheap, tough cuts of beef, this is one of my all-time favorite methods. You can give this an upgrade by topping with diced red onion, grated Cheddar cheese, and freshly sliced green onions, or you can serve the beef tips over hot mashed potatoes instead of tots, if you like.",

I wish I could have taken a better picture but I had no idea I'd end up leaving a review because it turned out to be addictive.  \n\nBut like any perfectly good recipe I can't leave it alone.  Also, I don't always have exactly the same ingredients.  So I used better than bouillon vegetable paste instead of beef bc that's what I had.  I used less because instead of plain water I threw in some worsterchire sauce and soy sauce with that much less water.  Do it to taste but be mindful of the salt.  I did 2 parts worsterchire from one part soy sauce, 3 drops liquid smoke.  Towards the end I added some canned mushrooms bc I needed to use  them.  I didn't have tots so I used mashed potatoes, and I had fresh zucchini I had to use so I lightly seasoned it and grilled that up to serve with.  I tossed some chives on top from the garden and let me tell you... Amazing.  \n\nI knew it would be good but had no idea it would be THIS good.  The flavors completely transform and yes, the meat gets super tender so don't shy away from the tough cheaper cuts.  I had elk stew meat that needed to be used and I can't imagine a better way of cooking it.  The next time I will be using beef but everything else will stay the same.  So so good. And so glad I was out of instant gravy mix (what as I thinking?), because it's what led me to this recipe.",
