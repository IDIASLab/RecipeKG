The Worcestershire sauce adds an additional flavor layer to the dressing that was quite appealing. I also sprinkled some sesame seeds and poppy seeds on top for eye appeal. Didn't use as much onion just some through-out. Didn't add the pecans and actually not sure if they're needed.",

Watermelon mint was very nice. The mint wasn't overpowering (but remember I didn't follow the measurements/proportions exactly). Was good to serve watermelon as a savory (rather than sweet/dessert). I do recommend going easy on the amount of dressing you pour over the assembled salad... I'm left with (probably tasty) soupy leftovers. Oh... and be sure to add the dressing at the absolute last minute. Enjoy.",
