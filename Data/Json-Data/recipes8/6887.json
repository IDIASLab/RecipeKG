The flavor profile is great. I might cut back the lemon a bit next time but the combination of anchovis, parmesan, red pepper flakes and lemony freshness works really good with romanesco. But I don't think cutting a whole head of romanesco in quarters is the best way to cook it in the oven. The stem needs a lot longer than the florets to cook through and in the end the whole dish was a quite dry. Next time I would use more olive oil and cut the romanesco in smaller pieces and leaving out the stem. Also, it prefer this as a side dish with something saucy.",
