I filled 1/2 with the jalapeno mixture and the other 1/2 with pepperoni and cheese (for the girls). Both were a HUGE hit! These are a bit time consuming but very easy and the results make these absolutely worth it. I actually mixed the dough and made them up the day before. Put them on a floured cookie sheet (very important so they don't stick to the pan) covered and put them in the fridge. Took them out to get to room temp the next day then proceeded w/ the boiling and baking. This worked great! I brushed them w/ egg before baking but did not top them w/ the salt until after I took them out of the oven and brushed each with melted butter just to take them over the top lol...PERFECT! I have bought the frozen filled pretzels in the past but I will not be doing that again as these are WAYYYYYY better YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks so much for sharing.:)",
