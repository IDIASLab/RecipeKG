Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using regular carrots instead of baby carrots (no big deal). Interesting mix of ingredients such as soy sauce and sazon (don t leave this one out) but all flavors blend together harmoniously. You can find sazon and adobo seasoning (don t leave this one out either) in the Hispanic section of your supermarket very common ingredients. This is a full-bodied robust stew with super tender beef and veggies and that Puerto Rican flavor is the star. I served it with Easy Black Beans and Rice (also on this site) topped with chopped onion and yellow rice. Absolutely delicious definitely will be made again and again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

I added an extra tablespoon of sofrito about 7 hours into it, thought the broth lacked depth of flavor.  The broth is also very watery, so about an hour before serving I added a slurry of cornstarch and broth to it.  This thickened it nicely and had more of a gravy than broth. I think next time I make this I\u2019ll use low sodium beef broth instead of water.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.",
