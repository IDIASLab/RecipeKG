This recipe was created because I absolutely love lemon-flavored desserts, but have an allergy to artificial colorants and dyes used in food. Following this recipe as written, you can take comfort in knowing you're not feeding your children any artificial colorings.",

My dough was very soft, to the point, it would be too soft to drop and roll in sugar. I baked a single batch to test and it produced a nice cake-like cookie with a nice lemon flavor that I dusted with confectioners sugar. While it makes for pretty-looking cookies I would skip the sugar in the future and go with a simple, less messy lemon frosting or glaze.",
