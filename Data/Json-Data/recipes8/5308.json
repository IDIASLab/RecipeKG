I followed the recipe as directed except I used figs and instead of raisins and used 2 cups pecans and 1 cup of walnuts instead of the other way around. I did add 1/4 cup almond butter before putting it in the oven when I realized that it wouldn't hold together in a bar and was going to be more like granola to see if that would help bind the ingredients together but it still turned out to be a granola that had to be eaten with a spoon. Did an ingredient get left out or a quantity get entered wrong? I hope the person that posted this recipe comments because otherwise I loved it and even the skeptics kept going back for second and third helpings but I really wanted a bar that would be easy to take along.",
