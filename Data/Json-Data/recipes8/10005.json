Rubbing garlic clove on bread seemed like too much work and not enough would get on bread. *I love garlic (also already had jar in fridge). I used garlic salt vs sea salt because*.  I rarely buy heirloom tomatoes, they a bit expensive: $3.99/lbs. I bought extra and plan to make again soon, before toms spoil. I encourage you to make, very quick and simple to prepare. Hope you enjoy as much as I did.",
