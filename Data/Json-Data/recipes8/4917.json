The first time I made it it was absolutely amazing. The second time I used a different brand of sausage and drained off a lot of the sausage grease and it was not nearly as good. So if you make it and aren't impressed you may want to try a different meat before you give up on it entirely.",

Then only a quart of fat free chicken broth and added a can of Great Northern beans (not drained) and about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes along with the oregano. Brought to a boil, then simmered about one hour. Yum!  I omitted the bay leaf, cauliflower and mushrooms. It did not need them, but I might try next time. There will definitely be a next time!",
