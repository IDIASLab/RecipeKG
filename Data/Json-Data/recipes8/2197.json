Absolutely no WOW factor from anyone and as tomato paste is a thickener way too much of it for that small amount of liquid. Recipe states a lot of sauce but 1 cup total liquid isn't much at all so after the initial taste test making the recipe as directed I ended up adding way more broth and wine to thin the sauce to a normal consistency. Probably won't make again sorry.",
