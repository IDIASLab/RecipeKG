I use brown rice which I cooked in chickn broth or stock boiled chicken breast in chicken stock/ broth (sometimes I use the leftover stock from boiling the chicken to cook the rice in so we don't waste anything!) and instead of the tomatoes I use a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes cause I had it on hand. (I think that was what made it really good.) I also added a couple diced jalapenos cause I like it hot! Garnish with cheese or sour cream or AVACADO! MMMM! Thank you for this dish!",

Sometimes I also add a little parmesan cheese at the end. I make small batches of it all the time to bring for lunches to work. It reheats well.",

If you cook the rice 20 minutes before adding the peppers I felt you would have raw peppers and rice mush so added the peppers about 8 minutes into the cooking time.  It doesn't say to cover the pan, which you will want to do.  I felt it was very bland and it took quit a bit of Tabasco to bring it to life.  My husband liked it after he had eaten a few spoons of it, but I would not make it again.",

I added more water to the stock (maybe about 3 cups more) to cover the chicken. Boiled until they looked cooked(about 10-15 minutes) then put them on a plate to cool. I then cut them into pieces and microwaved to make sure it was cooked through (because it was frozen it didn't cook in the center). I followed the instructions for the skillet cooking except I used instant rice - about 4 cups. I brought the rice mixture to a boil and then covered for the rice & peppers to cook. I forgot to add the tomatoes. It tasted wonderful. I'll definitely make it again.",
