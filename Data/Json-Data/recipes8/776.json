I\u2019m so glad I did! Mine was burning around the edges and I suggest it was because the size of the recommended crock pot was not given in the instructions. Please, everyone, when you post a slow cooker/crockpot recipe state the size of the cooking vessel. I saved my dessert in time and it was very delicious, though a little crusty around the edges.",
