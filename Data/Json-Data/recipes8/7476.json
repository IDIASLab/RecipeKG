This recipe is giving you the Kansai style which is mixing everything together and then pan frying. The Hiroshima style is my preference which is layering and flipping and layering and flipping. LOVE this so much. My filling ingredients were cabbage green onion and spam because I had it on hand. I also added yakisoba noodles which is another popular ingredient. This sauce is AWESOME. You can also mix worcestershire sauce with tonkatsu sauce and ketchup. Love the suggestion for panko as a topping along with mayonnaise (use kewpie)....Thank you sooo much! Oh ps the tapioca pearls are interesting...I'll need to do that in the future!",
