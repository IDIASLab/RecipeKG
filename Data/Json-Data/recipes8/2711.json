To eliminate the fat I didn't saute the chilies and onions but combined the soup evap milk milk broth onions green chilies and jalapeno and micro cooked for 8 minutes before adding the cooked chicken and putting the casserole together. Husband topped it with salsa but it was spicy enough for me without it. Will definitely make again.",
