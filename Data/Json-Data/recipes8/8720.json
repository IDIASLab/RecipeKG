My family loves bok choy so I added a good deal more of it to the recipe doubled up on the garlic and ginger and used one jalape\u00f1o seeds and all. Since fresh garlic and ginger tend to disappear in a dish the additional added good flavor to the chicken and bok choy. The farro gave the dish body. This could be used as a vegetarian dish by substituting firm tofu for the chicken. As a caterer I will definitely try this on our vegetarian clients.",
