Baking=chemistry. You cannot \"decrease the flour and add more peanut butter\" without changing the end result! It is not like soup where you can add some of this and take out some of that... soup will still be soup, albeit with a different flavor. Cookies and other baked good rely on fairly precise measurements--you can't just change things without the right sort of re-balancing of ingredients. Ok! End of rant.",
