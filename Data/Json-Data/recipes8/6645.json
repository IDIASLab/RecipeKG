I couldn't follow it exactly and instead used plain Greek yogurt blueberries in syrup from a can (sad huh?) and blueberry/pomegranate juice. Threw it all into the blender then poured into a 6 popsicle mold and the rest into a plastic container with a lid. With no added sugar the pops are slightly tangy with only a hint of sweetness which was perfect. Even the picky husband loved it. I will definitely make these with the right ingredients next time (fresh blueberries) but will stick with the Greek yogurt since the tangy flavor is too good to pass up.",
