                "reviewBody": "I only used this recipe as inspiration because other mushroom burger recipes required grilling (I have a tiny kitchen and no grill). But I kind of mixed recipe ideas, stuffing my two 'shrooms with 2 roma tomatoes, a heavy fistful of spinach, what is probably an unhealthy-but-yummy handful of shredded parmesan, basil paste (or fresh if you have it), 2 cloves minced garlic, 2-3 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar, S&P to taste, onion powder, a stalk of green onion, and bread crumbs. We criss-crossed the top with cut strips of roasted red peppers (the soft kind from the jar), and then baked it as instructed above. While it cooled after 12 minutes, we melted two slices of provolone cheese per mushroom on top, and then ate it on wheat bread instead of buns. But if you have proper burger buns, definitely opt for that. Basically my roommate and I had a field day with stuff we had in our kitchen already. It was definitely overstuffed and required either bad table manners or a fork and knife to eat, but SO, SO, SO good!\nI do plan on trying this exact recipe sometime.",

I then sauted some fresh garlic in some of the reserved bacon drippings. Then I added the spinach and cooked all of it together. After that mixture cooled I then added the rest of the ingredients and followed the rest of the recipe. The cooking time is a bit off though as I had to cook for at least 20 minutes not 12. Other than that this was awesome. A little mayo sauted onion tomato and a toasted bun and this is a keeper.",
