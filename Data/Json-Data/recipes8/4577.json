I made a half a batch of this, and it still made quite a bit. I was a bit worried about how much water was called for--I thought it might dilute the berry flavor a bit, and it did. Not bad, but I think if I were to make it again, I would probably use between 1/4-1/3 cup water for a half batch at most. The flavor was just a bit too weak for my tastes using the full amount of water. I also think adding some fresh lemon juice to this could really add an extra oomph of flavor as well. But for convenience sake, this recipe is great. I think it'll make a great accompaniment to pound cake or angel food cake; pancakes, waffles, or oatmeal; ice cream; or even a great addition to some lemonade or adult beverages. Possibilities are endless! Thank you for the recipe!",
