The only change I made is that I used whole allspice while cooking and fished them out before I pureed. I still got the nice flavor without the soup being brown. Cooked the vegetables in the Instant Pot. Worked very well. I revisited this soup for lunch the next day and it was killer! Definitely one that should be made one day and eaten the next. I think next time I make this I may blend half and leave the other half unblended and add some ham.",

I roasted all the parsnips and half the squash (that's how much fit on my pan) and cooked the rest of the squash in the chicken broth. Instead of leek I used green onion. I did not have any cream or half and half so I simply used a smaller amount of milk and then used some sour cream in each serving of the soup. It was a surprise to all of us how sweet this soup is!",
