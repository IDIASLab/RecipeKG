I only made one for lunch today, so I just eyeballed the fillings and loaded it up.  I made a Hawaiian pizza last week, had some fresh pineapple left in the fridge, and this certainly did have similar flavor.  It\u2019s definitely sweet, and that pineapple tamed the hot salsa.  Didn\u2019t have any sour cream on hand, but next time certainly will add that.  iamscaredofflies, thanks for sharing your favorite quesadilla recipe.",
