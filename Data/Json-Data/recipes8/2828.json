I made only minor changes - used probably double the amount of fajita seasoning and used refried black beans instead of regular. In a pinch I would use storebought chips but the homemade were fabulous really made it impressive and were well worth the effort which really wasn't that big of a deal (made the day before and put in airtight container). The only thing I would do differently next time is serve the avacado/guac on the side because if you have leftovers (and you likely will!) it turns brown and looks and tastes ugly even having added lime juice as a retardant. Definitely give this one a try for your next Mexican feast. It's a keeper!",

Next time I would buy the chips which would cut down the time a lot (and save on fat I'm sure). Also use of fresh ingredients in the guac like real lemon and garlic (lemon pepper?) plus a little sour cream yields better results.",

He works very hard 6 days a week at an Italian restaurant. Since he works late every night he usually misses dinner with the family so every Saturday night I make him a big meal to come home to and this week he wanted something in the line of fajitas. This recipe looked so good and it did not fail to WOW him. I made it mostly verbatim with the exception of the guacamole - I didn't have any lemon pepper on hand so I used regular pepper and added a splash of lemon juice and lime juice to the guac and it was SO good he ate three servings and was so full he couldn't move for awhile lol. He's bringing some in to work today to show it off to his coworker who is from Mexico and I'm pretty interested to see what he thinks since his wife is an amazing cook when it comes to authentic Mexican food. I was very very pleased with this recipe and it is now a regular in my recipe keeper thanks Rhonda35 for posting!",

For example you can make the chips and meat a day or so ahead of time and then all you have to do is assemble and bake when you are ready to serve. I also agree with others about buying chips. With so many brands to chose from you can easily find a comparable chip and save yourself a lot of time. Finally this recipe makes a ton! I only made 1/4 of the recipe. I highly recommend that unless you are making this as a main dish item for an extremely large family with big appetites you might want to consider cutting it in half.",
