I specifically searched for a pistachio muffin recipe and since this was the only one I gave it a try (though I usually cherry pick the recipes with the most reviews/highest ratings). Since this one had no reviews yet here I am writing my first ever review on AR and finally paying the community back. I followed the recipe without intentional modifications. It was easy and pretty fast. I thought they needed 18 minutes in my oven but they did end up slightly drier than I would prefer. They also didn't rise as much as I hoped but the texture was good. Like most pistachio flavored things I've eaten the pistachio flavor was not as as noticeable as I would like. My kids both gave the muffins an 8 out of 10 and I will make them again (perhaps researching a way to boost the pistachio flavor)",
