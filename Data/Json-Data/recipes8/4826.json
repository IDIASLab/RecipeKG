Ironically, having been an allrecipes.com member for a long time, I actually learned of this recipe from a posting at another website.  Thankfully, they gave proper credit to allrecipes.com.  I didn't have the mushrooms called for in the recipe, so I just used a 10 ounce can of mushroom stems and pieces, and it was exceptional.  I'm trying to eat healthier again and this one is a nice choice for that.  Next time, I may add more onions, potatoes, and roasted red peppers ... more would have been better, especially if one doesn't prepare another side dish.  Good stuff!",

I had to cook it longer b/c the potato was still crunchy which made the salmon overcooked but that wasn't the main issue. The main thing was the flavours just didn't meld together they were very individual. I think frying the onions with some butter a little garlic cooking the potato a little and adding some more spice to the salmon would make it better. And perhaps covering with tinfoil for a bit.",

It is true that the potatoes dont get done enough realizing this we actually cut the potatoes super thin and cooked them with the onions for fifteen minutes... But they still werent done. This dish has a very simple clean flavor. We made sure to season each layer very well with salt and pepper and followed the recipe to the letter. Will definitely make again but cook potatoes longer before adding the rest of the ingredients....",

I used one enormous sweet onion fresh red pepper strips and canned mushroom pieces instead of the portabellos.

The baking dish was nearly full and made a very appetizing appearance on the table. Love this recipe!",
