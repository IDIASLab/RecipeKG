That said, if you are making this for the first time, I would ease into the stevia..maybe use 1/2 tablespoon to start and see what you think. A tablespoon made this too sweet for a regular type bread if that's what you are looking for and left an aftertaste ( I am very sensitive to alternative sweetners). It also, doesnt rise as much as a regular bread but the consistency and texture are really good.",

Used unsalted nuts, but will reduce salt next time to 1/2 tsp Bc it was just a tiny bit too salty for me.  Didn\u2019t rise as nicely as the pic, but I\u2019m at high altitude and without any flour, I expected that.  Highly recommend.",
