I could only use five slices, there was too much with eight.\nOtherwise I cut the mixture back, and it was still good. Excellent wet/dry ratio!\nI will re-adjust the receipe, and make again.\nWayne, Englewood, CO",

If I were to make this again, I know that I\u2019d add some vanilla extract to the milk-egg mixture.  Funny thing, my husband asked if that was  shredded cheese on the top, and that\u2019s what it looked like.  Minor thing, but I think I\u2019d chop the apples the next time instead of shredding.  Buttered the bread slices, stacked them, and cut into cubes with my electric knife.  Used my food processor for shredding the apples, so this really was a quick-and-easy recipe.
