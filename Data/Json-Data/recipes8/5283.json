My muffins were done baking at 20 minutes. Delicious! The whole family loved them. We didn't even make it to breakfast tomorrow--came home from work tonight and they were half gone.",

I made them as mini muffins for my 16 month old and he ate 3 of them as soon as they came out of the oven and it wasn't even meal time:) I only made a few small changes: I used healthy oil instead of butter I chopped up apricots(without soaking) instead of using raisins I used 2 tablespoons of flax and finally I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and they were plenty sweet! Thank you for such a great recipe. Next time I think i'll add some pecans and blueberries.",

I only made a few minor changes - doubled the vanilla added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and used molasses instead of brown sugar because we are cutting back on refined sugar. Otherwise followed it to a T. The first batch went so fast I am doubling it when I make it again this week so I can freeze some. (A great base recipe too...you could shred zuchinni in it instead of carrots etc.)",

Combine all the wet ingredients together first. Sift all the dry ingredients together and add to the wet ingredients last. But here is the REAL secret to the best muffins. Gently fold in the dry ingredients to the wet ones until just barely incorporated. You may still see some dry areas or lumps but that is perfectly okay. Gently spoon the mixture into the cups. DO NOT \"press\" the mixture into the cups. DO NOT bang the muffin tin on the counter to reduce air pockets (like you would a cake) either. Treat them gently and bake as per the directions. If you follow these tips you will have nicely raised fluffy moist muffins. If you don't... well... you can always use them for hockey pucks!",

They are extremely moist and almost have a spongy consistency to them (in a good way);) I accidentally grated almost double the amount of carrots I needed so I just threw them in anyway and it worked out fine! They also came out of the pan very easily... came out in one perfect piece and did not break or get stuck as I often have trouble with (I used mini muffin pans.) I can see these will be a staple around our house from now on perhaps I will make a few batches at a time and then throw them in the freezer and take a few out when we will be on the road and the kids need a healthy snack.
