Traditionally served in a soft bun (pane e panelle) as a simple and filling lunch. Vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free, they're perfect to serve at your next dinner party in lieu of crackers with dips, or with grilled vegetables or pickles. Wonderful with cold beer or wine.",

I served mine the traditional way sandwiched in a soft, sesame bun with a sprinkle of flaked sea salt and a healthy squeeze of lemon. I used the metric measurements using two 12x8 baking trays lined with parchment paper. I cooked one half in my air fryer at 200\u00b0C for about 15 minutes. Both ways work wonderfully.",
