My son volunteered me to make a couple of cakes for his school's cake walk fundraiser and I decided to give this one a test before making it for the school. It was by far one of the easiest cakes I have ever made and it is delicious! The only draw back (if you consider it one) is that once I put it on the table for the family to try it was gone in less than five minutes. It was a huge hit and my husband is having me take one up to his work today for him and his co-workers. I am sure it will be a big hit at the cake walk and has become a family favorite!",

I used shortening and flour make sure to get in all the creases. I ended up using buttermilk because I had precisely one cup left. I also used BAKERS squares as I did not have powdered cocoa. Both easy conversions to the original recipe simply by reducing the butter a bit. (3 Tb in my case). It is also true that the cake does not need frosting. I simply drizzled the 'Chocolate Glaze I' on top for fun. Yummy cake! Thanks for posting!",
