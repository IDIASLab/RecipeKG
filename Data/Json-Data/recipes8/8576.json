Used lite soy sauce to cut the salt, increased the garlic, used 1 tsp. minced fresh ginger.  A lot of reviewers said to half the amount of sugar but I tasted it and felt I needed to add more but not the whole amount.  Since I doubled the sauce, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar.  I lined my pan with heavy duty foil then poured most of the thickened sauce over bone-in thighs (skin removed) and some boneless breasts but reserved a little.  Cooked, covered with foil for 30 minutes, removed foil, poured remainder of sauce over and bake another 20-30 minutes.  Wow.  Really good! Update: I made this again using slices of tri tip and it was great.  Fantastic with salmon.  I had a large fillet and basically baked it the same way but reduced the oven temp. to 375 and baked for a little less time till fish was flakey.",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent. After reading several reviews, I did make the following changes: Doubled the sauce. In the doubled recipe, I doubled the garlic (fresh pressed), reduced sugar by half and used packed brown sugar instead of white sugar, used lite soy sauce (I always use lite, regular is TOO salty), rounded the tablespoons of cornstarch, used fresh ground pepper (five pepper blend), and I had boneless, skinless thighs. I baked at 375 degrees, 25 mins covered with foil, then 15 mins uncovered (total 40 mins). I did not baste, but just covered the thighs with the sauce. Would've used fresh ground ginger if I'd had it. Cleanup was a breeze as long as I soaked pans right away, it washed right out. With these changes it was scrumptious and got rave reviews from my family. Great with thighs, would also try breasts or other cuts. Definitely a keeper! Thanks Marian!",

                "reviewBody": "I make this recipe in a slow cooker and it is simply fantastic. I just put the chicken thighs in, cover with the sauce (exact recipe)and put it on low for at least 5 hours.  The longer the chicken cooks the more savory the dish, and the chicken just falls apart (shreds) in the sauce.  About an hour before I'm ready to serve I throw in some chopped green pepper, carrots, celery (or whatever vegetables I want to get rid of in the fridge), and then 20 minutes before serving I throw in a can of drained pineapple chunks. The pineapple removes the saltiness and the dish is perfect spooned over rice.  Absolutely amazing! I find this recipe foolproof --today I tripled the sauce (made 20 thighs), dropped the bowl and lost most of the sauce all over myself and the floor (GOD what a mess!) and was too lazy to make more so just used whatever was left.  It STILL came out perfect!!  And if the sauce is too thin I just remove some from the crockpot, add a little cornstarch paste and/or Veloutine gravy thickener, microwave it till it boils and thickens and mix it back in with the rest. Too easy!  Thank you for an unforgettable recipe that everyone loves!",

The only changes I make is using boneless skinless chicken breasts and I do cut the soy sauce down a bit and I substitute some of the white sugar for brown sugar to cut down on the saltiness because my husband thought it was a bit too salty. Also,do cut the temp down on this. I go 375 for the first 15 minutes or so and then down to 350 for another 20-25 minutes. Continually baste to get that yummy glaze. Terrific recipe!!!

To make a meal, I added fresh snow peas, sliced water chestnuts, squares of yellow onion and green pepper, and fresh pineapple chunks. We put over white rice. It was as good as a very good oriental restaurant's! We did not like the chicken thigh dark-meat with the bone in much though, so next time I will make with chicken breast,BONELESS,SKINLESS thigh meat, shrimp, or pork.
