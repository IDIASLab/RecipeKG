                "reviewBody": "My mother's Korean and I make this dish quite frequently. This is a decent basic recipe but to make it your own consider these alterations as I use! Instead of sugar, use honey or kyro syrup. After the meat cooks for a while the sugar will help thicken the sauce and caramelize nicely. That adds the sweetness you HAVE to have. (Otherwise you're making plain stir fried beef Chinese style!) Definitely leave out the salt as that's what the soy sauce is for! To tenderize the meat so it's not stringy (if using a cheap cut of beef) mince up some Korean/Asian pear or kiwi and add that in there. My mom even uses Pepsi/Coke when we're out of fruit in the house and it works great! Plus it adds some additional sweetness. I'm lazy and use a mini food processor to mince my garlic and fruit together then add them both to the bowl. I never put in the extra vegetables, if I do use any I use sliced green onions for color only. Also, MSG isn't very good for you in large amounts so if you don't feel like using it leave it out. MSG adds a little more depth to the flavors without increasing the saltiness, so feel free to use it at your own discretion.",

I also omit the salt--the soy sauce already has plenty of salt and I used reduced sodium soy sauce at that.  I added a bit more sugar to taste as I recall it to have a slightly sweet and salty taste.  Also topped with fresh scallions when it was done and served it over hot white rice.  Yum!",

At the restaurant, I first fried the beef and some marinade in a fry pan to get it nice and cooked. THEN, I would put it over the flames to give it that little bit of flame kissed goodness. One suggestion, try eating the beef with a little bit of fresh Pineapple. It's an amazing contrast. \r\n\r\nBravo though, this is a great recipe.",

Tripled the marinade and used a reviewer suggestion and added seasoned rice vinegar (3 tablespoons, 9 if you triple it).  I cooked the beef in a large skillet, added about a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with a little warm water to the cooking beef/marinade and it gave a nice consistency.  I also threw in Asian style frozen veggies and served over white rice.  I've made this twice and I plan on keeping this as part of my 'main' dishes.  I think this would also be excellent to try with chicken.",
