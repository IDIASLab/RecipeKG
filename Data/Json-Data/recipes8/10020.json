Baked on a bed of onions and jalapeno peppers and thickly covered with seasoned salsa, the salmon stays moist and tender without giving your kitchen any fishy smell. Even though these nachos don't contain cheese, they're topped with a rich sour cream drizzle which makes them every bit as decadent as real nachos.",

I also used Julio's chips, served Spanish rice and refried beans on the side. The green onions, avocado and cilantro on top are a must, but the sour cream mixed with lime juice instead of water...dang!",
