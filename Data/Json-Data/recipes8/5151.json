Even with dry vermouth I'd suggest greatly reducing the ratio or eliminating it altogether. I just don't think either type of vermouth goes well with blue curacao but that might be my personal taste. Also you should garnish with a lemon twist and not olives. Hope this helps! Great looking drink as-is though.",

It s a great way to test a drink before making the big boy version. When I first saw this it looked a bit strange; whoever heard of Blue Curacao mixed with olives? So I figured I d try it without the olives keeping the rest of the recipe unchanged. First even for two mini martinis I needed to increase the amount of ingredients. If you used a standard martini glass it would only fill it half way. How did it taste? My wife couldn t get past the first sip because she said it tasted like rubbing alcohol. I for one prefer a Classic Martini but on occasion I can take one that s sweet with a pleasant blend of flavors. This had neither and just tasted off. Substituting pineapple juice for the vermouth might salvage it.",
