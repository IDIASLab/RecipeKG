                "reviewBody": "8.16.20  First, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to simmer the pintos for 40-45 minutes and expect them to be soft, even when soaked overnight.  Even in an Instant Pot\u00ae, you\u2019ll cook them for 45 minutes. (wish I\u2019d done that).  I\u2019d recommend you not start on the ground beef mixture until your beans are cooked.  Why do you brown the ground beef and  seasoned salt, set aside, and then pull out another skillet to cook the onions, garlic, and spices\u2026another pan to wash?  Why not just brown the beef, and then add the other ingredients to the same pan as the ground beef?  For anybody who doesn\u2019t know what dried cilantro is, it\u2019s coriander, a spice many may not have in their pantry.  Also confusing is the recipe calls for dried cilantro and then at the end, fresh cilantro.  If you don\u2019t have coriander, just chop up your fresh cilantro, tripling it to sub for the dry.  This turned out very bland, and I ended up adding MORE of all the spices as well as freshly-ground black pepper and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  Also, I think beef broth would be better than chicken broth in this recipe, but just my opinion.  I want to be clear, I made the recipe as written, tasted, and then made flavor adjustments, so we'd at least be able to eat it.  I think this recipe could be simplified, and I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying it, but it just didn\u2019t work for me.  We ate this, but didn\u2019t save leftovers; this is one that I won\u2019t be making again.  Sorry for the less than favorable review.",

The other suggestions would be ones that I'd make, too.  I don't like cilantro, so I would switch it out for parsley, which I grow and keep in the freezer.  It seems like this recipe could go in many directions with seasoning, depending on personal preference.",
