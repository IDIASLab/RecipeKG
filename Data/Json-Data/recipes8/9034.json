                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe real close to how it's written, but I just did a turkey breast instead of the whole bird and I didn't have onion salt, so I used onion powder.   I had issues with the bird not getting up to temperature, which I'm almost positive was due to the tenting.   I seriously had this thing in the oven for 5 hours, the last 2 at 375.   3 1/2 hours in, I'm still at 125, so I raised to 375.   Took another hour to get to 140.   Finally at 4 1/2 hours, I pulled the tenting and it came up very quickly.   My oven temperature is right.   I have a couple thermometers inside (always) just to make sure my oven isn't lying to me.  Now normally, I would pull stars for a recipe so off on timing, but the taste and juiciness of the bird was so fantastic that I can't pull anything off.   I actually consider myself a bit of a turkey expert and I've never had one so nice before.   The flavor was unique and it was so juicy.   One more change I made was I didn't add 1/2 cup of butter every hour hour.   I did the initial 1/2 cup, another one about 1 1/2 hours in and then I basted a couple of times with the liquid in the pan.   If I was to make it again, I would stick with the onion powder vs. salt.   I would sub garlic powder for the salt, and perhaps use unsalted butter.   There is plenty of salt in the seasoning salt and the bacon to go around.   I will definitely be making again using slightly different baking techniques.",
