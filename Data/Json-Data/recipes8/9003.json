I add a little oregano and then blend it. when that is done I season the turkey with season all salt and a little cumin. sear the turkey and put in roasting dish. pour salsa over turkey making sure to cover it all then spoon pimento stuffed green olives over the turkey. drop in 2 bay leaves. cover and cooked turkey amount of time that the packaging it came in said usually around 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Super moist and super yummy. served over rice with extra sauce or in the turkey curtido sandwich (recipe on this sight). We clean the sauce from our plate with french bread or warm tortillas. Once you get the hang of making the salsa this recipe is quick. You can also marinate the turkey overnight in the sauce. it lets the sauce soak into the turkey a little.",

I slow roasted it overnight in a 250 degree electric roaster and served the olives on the side instead of cooking them with the turkey and had additional sauce from the bottom of the pan in a gravey boat for those who want more. I wasn't sure about the green olives with this but they seemed to be what made it outstanding! This will be my standard roast turkey recipe from now on. No more boring roast turkey around here!",
