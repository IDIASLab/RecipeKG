Since there is considerable variation in member's comments I might add that perhaps the quality of ingredients could be an issue. For example if you start with a cheap wine don't expect stellar results. If you add garlic salt rather than garlic and salt don't expect a miracle. The same applies to the freshness of all ingredients from asparagus (which can be like wood) to pepper. If you are not using a pepper mill then you are not using pepper. Think sawdust. Fortunately salt is a rock. Even then sea salt tastes very different from rock salt. Just some food for thought.:-)",
