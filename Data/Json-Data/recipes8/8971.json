I grilled my turkey over charcoals and oak wood using indirect heat for about 4hrs it was the bomb!!!. after the brine process believe it or not there was no need for any extra seasoning (for real!!) my process of what I did is on the reviews of the TURKEY BRINE RECIPE) from this site. truly one of the best turkeys I have ever cooked. Ps. and I grilled it directly on the grate to really get that grilled flavor. Ok now I'm done.UPDATE 11/23/07 I DID THE GRILLED TURKEY AGAIN THIS YEAR VERY GOOD ONLY CHANGE THE BRINE PROCESS THIS TIME CAME OUT AS GREAT AS THE FIRST TIME!!! 10 STARS",
