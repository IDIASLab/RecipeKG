I put the the flour and cornmeal in a mixture in a zip lock bag with kosher salt and pepper but did not add the taco seasoning & shaked the fish in the bag.   I made the copycat Bonefish Grill Bang Bang Shrimp sauce.  Served this with lettuce wraps instead of tortilla wraps in order to lower the carbs. Served the dish - lettuce wraps, slaw mixture from the recipe, fish from the recipe, drizzled the Bang Bang sauce on top, drop of sour cream.  Side of homemade guacamole and tortilla chips.  I will make again.  Easy quick dinner, very tasty.",
