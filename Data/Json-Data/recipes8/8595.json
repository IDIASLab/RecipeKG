Here's how I altered it, based on our tastes and the other reviews: (1) used 6 thighs, not 12, (2) doubled the sauce, (3) halved the water (will omit completely next time), (4) omitted the salt, (5) added cayenne. WONDERFUL!!!!!!!! One further note.... The second time I made this, the baby started crying just as I was about to start cooking the sauce, so I threw the uncooked sauce and chicken in the oven and went on my way. We didn't notice any difference! So from now on I won't be wasting time cooking the sauce.",

I poured the sauce over chicken breasts and baked at 375, covered, for approximately 45 min.  I removed the cooked chicken to a platter, then poured the remaining sauce into a saucepan, over med-high heat,  I added about 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch and stirred constantly.  Within minutes it was thickened & bubbly.  I then basted it over the cooked chicken and then put the chicken on the outdoor grill just to crisp it up and give it that authentic \"barbeque\" feel.

I left out the water and used Heinz chili sauce vs. ketchup for a little extra kick. I also added a tsp. of liquid smoke anad some minced garlic. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate overnight. The smell was downright heavenly on the grill and the taste was fabulous!",

I made five changes in my preparation: soaked the meat in a salt sugar and spice brine for an hour covered the pan bottom with onion slices used honey threw in a dash each of cinnamon and cayenne and I added a couple of minutes broiling time to the cooking time. While it is a \"runny\" sauce it was very tasty; however one could simmer the sauce longer and thicken it with corn starch. Some of the best chicken sauces I've had have been thin -- it's a common style where I live Western Kentucky.",

Add 1/2 Tsp of red pepper 1/2 Tsp onion powder 1/2 Tsp garlic powder. Super tender recipe. Excellent dinner to freeze leftovers. Tangy vinegar taste.
