This dish definitely lives up to the \"spicy\" in its name but the flavor is otherwise kind of lacking. I'd definitely up the hoisin and soy sauce- and cut back on the rice this makes A LOT of food. I don't think I'll follow the fried rice part of this recipe again but the rice itself is definitely going into rotation as a side when we have asian food!",
