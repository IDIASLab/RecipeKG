For the folks who had it come out dry or crumbly, make sure all your ingredients are at room temp (about 70\u00b0f), the eggs are whipped enough (it\u2019s really hard to over beat eggs, you\u2019ll know for sure if you do), and that there are still visible bubbles in the batter after incorporating the flour mixture. If it still comes out dry/crumbly, light over baking or altitude might be slight issues. I take mine out right as the edges start to turn golden and the center still looks.....questionable? Also, be sure to use more confectioners sugar for the towel than you\u2019d think, it\u2019ll really help keep it from sticking. Happy baking, everyone!",
