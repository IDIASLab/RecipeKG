                "reviewBody": "Here are some tips for this cobbler recipe. If you want to reduce the fat you can reduce the butter to 1/4 cup and the oil to 1/2 cup without compromising the flavor. This is a crust-heavy recipe. If you want more emphasis on the peaches just make half the topping ingredients or make two pans of peaches and divide one crust recipe over them. You can also add flavors to the crust (like vanilla or almond extract) or a splash of flavor to the peaches (like amaretto). You can change the cinnamon to nutmeg or a combination of spices if you like or sprinkle the top with chopped nuts before baking.",

I prefer a cobbler-crumb combination for the crust but gave this a try. I actually cut all ingredients in half except for the peaches( used about 6 medium) and baked in a pie plate. This cobbler was more like peaches with a very very sweet sugar cookie on top. It reminded me more of a crumb. The first couple spoonfuls were good but I too got overwhelmed after the initial spoonfuls from the sweetness like another reviewer stated. This recipe was super fast to make and I may try it again but next time reduce the sugar. It is a quick dessert if one is needed for a potluck or other occasion.",
