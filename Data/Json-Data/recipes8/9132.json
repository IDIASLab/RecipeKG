The cooking time for the rice and frozen vegetables is about half the time it actually takes to cook them until they are done. I ended up using 32 oz of chicken broth and it is still too thick. I won\u2019t be making this again.",

Did you use \"cooked\" rice?  Recipe calls for cooked rice, so basically, all you're doing is just reheating it, and frozen mixed veggies cook in a very short time.",
