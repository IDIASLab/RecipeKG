Just for clarification the recipe calls for 2 canned chipotle peppers not 2 cans of chipotle peppers. That means you take two of the peppers out of the one can (this of course can be adjusted to taste.) I think I will make extra of the sauce and put it in the freezer to use up the rest of the can of chipotle peppers. I much prefer making my own sauce than buying a can of already-made enchilada sauce. Tasty!",
