        "description": "Ice cream cake on a stick, crunchies and all! The shell coating against the cake part of the ice cream sandwich gives it the most amazing texture. It's not thin and brittle like normal chocolate-coated pops, but more like the inside of a Carvel\u00ae ice cream cake. Assorted toppings (I like crushed Oreo's\u00ae!) add crunchy texture and the cake warms a little so it's a perfect contrast to the cold ice cream. You just have to try this, no dessert could be easier! Kids would have fun making these but adults alike will enjoy eating them.",
