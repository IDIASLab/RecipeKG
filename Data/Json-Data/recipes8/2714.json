I strained the broth thru a wire strainer into another pot. I estimated the water to add to make the 15 cups. I wasn't going to measure hot liquid. I didn't have coriander. I coarsely chopped up cilantro (the leaf part of the same plant as coriander) and added it to the bowls of those who wanted it. I didn't have tomatoes with chile peppers so I chopped up two jalape\u00f1o peppers. Fresh just seemed better than canned. My chili powder was hot. Despite my changes this soup came out mild which is fine. Some like it mild some like it hot. Those that liked it hot added hot pepper sauce to their own bowl. The last 5 minutes of the 25 I added a half a bag of frozen sweet corn. Also I used the little pieces of nachos at the bottom of the bag. How I served it: I put a scoop of rice and a pinch of cilantro into the bowls. I laddled on the soup. On top I put the cheese first and then the chips. Then they added hot pepper sauce. This did make a HUGE amount. But with 7 people I loved the leftovers. If my two child want Mexican for their graduation party I will double this recipe. laughs As I am writing this my oldest is going back for his 5th bowl! I think this was a wonderful recipe. But it also leaves room for the chef's imagination and taste difference. S Way to go Zeke!",

I added a can of rinsed drained black beans and 1 1/2 c. frozen corn for texture. Instead of blending the onions (which bruises them) I fried the onion and garlic in margerine till tender then I added the water and bouillion. If you like your soup smooth-blend the vegetables. But if you like texture try it this way. We topped with cheese-but also added a dollop of sour creme. For a southwest recipe-there was a very strong Italian taste so next time I will cut back on the amount of oregano-but it was good with the full amount I just wanted more of a southwest taste. The kids loved it (even the picky 1 year old) and half of the recipe fed 7 of us with enough leftovers to feed us another meal. I will definately fix this again. Thanks Zeke!",
