One key is to use the ultra thin sliced chicken that will absorb taste of sauce.  Second time I added some sliced water chestnuts and peanuts at the end for the crunch.    This recipe made perfect amount for three people.  You can also increase the snow peas or some julienne carrot sticks to bulk it up to serve four.  Don't miss this!  Yummy!",

I made sure to season the chicken and I cooked it first in pecan oil which I use occasionally.  I added carrots and celery to the vegetables .  Omitted the oyster sauce because I did not have any,  did not add sugar, misread the dish and threw the chicken in with the sauce, used a bit less cornstarch , added a bit of sriracha, and the dish was terrific!  Only wish I had not forgotten to buy nuts as I like cashews or peanuts on my stir fry!",
