I HATE mayonaise but really wanted to try the recipe how it was shown on the show so I used it. I just brushed a little on-basically to use as an adhesive for the parm and seasonings. I could not taste the mayo at all once it was grilled. The flavors of the corn chili powder and cheese were a nice blend. Will definitely do this again. Corn on the cob is great by itself but it is fun to kick it up a bit too!",

EDIT: I tried this recipe again but grilled the corn in husks and left the whole mayo thing out completely. In a separate bowl I mixed together grated parmesan cheese chili powder salt pepper and added 1 tsp. of smoked paprika. When the corn came off the grill we buttered it and then sprinkled the cheese/spice mixture onto it - much better!!!",
