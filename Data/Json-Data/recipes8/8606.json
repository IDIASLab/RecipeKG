It was easy enough to make, but there wasn't anything special or unique about it.  \n\nThe recipe didn't specify what size tortilla to use, so I used soft taco size.  Seven on each layer was far, far too much.  I ended up with hard, dry tortilla layered between soupy cheese.  \nAlso, the combination of sour cream, cream of chicken soup, and chicken needs something to kick it up.  One 7-ounce jar of chiles is not enough.  I added 3 tablespoons of hot chili garlic sauce, and that made it more distinctive.\n\nAlso, the recipe specified 15 chicken thighs, but not the amount of chicken breasts.  I used four large breast, and that was not enough; I couldn't taste the chicken around all the tortillas.\n\nIf I were to make this again, I would half everything, use 4 chicken breasts, and add some mixed vegatables.  Over 800 calories a serving is a lot, and I personally don't think it's worth it.",

In a bowl combined 4oz cream cheese, one 10oz can cream of chicken soup, 8oz of sour cream (gradually add sour cream to cream cheese then add other ingredients), half a packet of taco seasoning, shredded chicken and two cups of cooked minute rice (precook rice so it won't absorb the soup mixture).  Used the pizza cutter to cut tortillas into bite size pieces.  Lined dishes with half of pieces topped with half of mixture, sprinkled with some taco sauce and covered with half of cheese, and repeated this one more time ending with cheese.  Baked at 350F for 30 min.  Excellent!!! A recipe we will be making over and over.",
