I also like roasted peppers with my chilaquiles so I roast jalapenos or buy canned chipotles. I throw in a large minced clove of garlic with the onion and tomato and add the peppers just before the egg at which time I also add roughly chopped cilantro. Just before the eggs are finished cooking I add some smoked mozzarella cut into cubes and this melts wonderfully and adds a nice smokey flavor which complements the peppers. If you don't judge the crispness of the tortillas right you may burn them while sauteing the onion. You may want to remove them from the oil dry and return them when you begin cooking the eggs.",

I added shredded cheddar and jack cheese to the top... I also added the tomatoes after that.... I liked them cold on top of the melted cheese personal preference. I didnt really like how the tortilla strips became soggy by the time I plated this but there's probably no way to avoid that. Great recipe thanks!",
