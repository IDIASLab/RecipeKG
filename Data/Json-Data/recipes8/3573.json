Simply spread the dip on one half of a flour tortilla topped with shredded mozzarella and/or cheddar sprinkled on some more fresh cilantro and folded in half. Grilled them a few hours before my party started and put in the refrigerator. Then about 30 minutes before I was ready to serve them as an appetizer I put them in a 350-degree oven for 20-30 minutes to warm them up. Had guacamole and salsa to top them with. Definitely make this dip a day or even two ahead of time for the flavor to develop. Also I used one store-bought rotisserie chicken which worked wonderfully.",

I brought three appetizers to a party and this was the only one that I didn't have any leftovers of.  I omitted the cilantro (personal taste) and lessened the chili powder because I didn't know if the guests liked spicy foods.  Also, I beat the cream cheese and spices together first, then mixed everything together.  I left the juice in the tomatoes.  It was just wonderful!  Thanks So Much!!",

Refrigerated overnight in tightly wrapped Saran Wrap and then sliced right before. They were excellent and everyone loved them!",

What a good choice because as it warmed up...guys came out of the woodwork looking for whatever it was that smelled so good. They swarmed on it like locusts and if they could have gotten away with it I think someone would have licked the plate. I served this with hard corn tortilla chips and soft flour tortillas. Great recipe as is but you can tweak it to suit your tastebuds with different/more cheese spicier etc. I am going to try this base without chicken and spoon it onto a thin chix breast and roll and bake it in the oven. Then serve with some kind of corn/black bean relish...getting hungry just thinking about it. Make this recipe and you won't be disappointed.",

The only complaint I'd have is that it's a little too rich for my tastes (and i LOVE rich rich foods..). Made it a second time halving the cream cheese and adding a little more sour cream (a quarter cup or so). Much better this time and it gave me an idea...this would be great for chicken enchilada filling! So with all my leftovers (which as I said is a lot) I put about 2/3 cup filling in the middle of each ten-inch flour tortilla rolled them up spread plain sour cream over the tops of each one shredded some sharp cheddar over each one and put them in a glass baking dish and warmed 15 minutes (just till the cheese on top is melty). Then I garnished each one with extra cilantro. OMG...these were the best chicken enchiladas ever! AND my fiance thought they were from a restaurant. Kudos!:) So I must say that overall I liked this recipe much better as enchiladas for dinner than as a dip. But still very good either way!",
