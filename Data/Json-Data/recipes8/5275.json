I didn't have everything on hand so omitted tamarind curry leaves; subbed canola for coconut oil used yellow onions and whole dried red chili peppers cause that's what I had... This was fabulous. I think the quality of the curry powder matters the recipe calling for at least twice what I've ever used in one dish before. I used a Madras curry powder purchased at an Indian shop near my parish. Served this to company everyone had seconds. Goes great with beer.",
