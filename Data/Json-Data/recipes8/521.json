There is something definitely wrong with the ratio of fat to flour though, in my opinion. My logs spread out, almost into a giant, flat cookie on each of the baking sheets! This made it very difficult to slice into nice biscotti form. They were not pretty at all. All of that being said . . . they are delicious! Looking at other biscotti recipes, I think the butter needs to be cut back and there needs to be more flour added. I will try these again (because they are so tasty), but will tweak until I get it right.",
