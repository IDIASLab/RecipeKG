Best when made with fresh cranberries, fresh orange juice, and lots of pulp! My family loves them without the glaze, but some of my sweet-toothed friends prefer it with, as the muffins are only slightly sweet on their own.",

I made the following modifications, which gave me 12 muffins that were denser than usual muffins; somewhere between a muffin and a scone.\n1) I only had dried cranberries, so I soaked them in 1 oz of dark rum.\n2) I also added 1/2 oz of Cointreau to the OJ mixture before adding to the flour. \n3) For the glaze, I added a teaspoon of Triple Sec to the OJ.\nThe orange flavor is very forward, and the cranberries (dried) add a nice sour contrast and a bit of texture.  \nIf I had a food truck, I'd sell these in a heartbeat!  \n\nTip:  Definitely line the muffin tins with parchment--adds a lot to the presentation and makes it 1000% fool proof to get  the muffins out of the pan!",
