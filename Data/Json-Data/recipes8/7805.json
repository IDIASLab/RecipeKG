You can find boba, black large-pearl tapioca, at most Asian food stores and in the Asian aisles of some more commercial food places. In my experience, it isn't necessary to cook them for a full 45 minutes; bring the water to a full boil, add the boba till they float, then reduce to a simmer for 25 minutes, covered. Then remove from heat and allow to stew for about 20 additional minutes. Rinse them with cool water and store them in the fridge, covered, with sugar or honey dissolved in water to keep them hydrated. My bag of boba directs that you use roughly 6x the volume of water as boba while cooking. Of course you can use whatever type of tea, with sweetener of choice and milk added to preference.",

It's a hard thing to make, and your recipe was nice shot at it.",
