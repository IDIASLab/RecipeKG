They're way too big for us but that s easy enough to fix. Next time I m going to measure out some 1/3 cup and 1/4 cup and see which one we like better. Had to cook about 5 additional minutes for them to be done. Don't skip the paprika that really helps the biscuit's eye appeal The biscuit is fairly flat but the flavor is very good texture a bit heavy and just a little doughy but we liked them well enough to make again. And oh my are they ever to easy to make.",
