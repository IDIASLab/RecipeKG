The second time, I overcame that problem by sauteeing the minced shallot in 1 tsp butter, until everything was evenly caramelized, adding the garlic and sauteeing for another minute. That did the trick! The role of both of those ingredients in the stuffing was that of a subtle, yet masterful supporting player, not prima donnas competing vainly for the limelight. I then deglazed the roasting pan with 2 Tb dry Marsala (reduced vigorously a few minutes until the vapors ceased to tingle the nose,) poured it over the chicken and POW! The flavor was absolutely spectacular.  Because of those two steps, which represented a big improvement, this only narrowly misses the 5 star rating.",

It looked very nice on the plate because you could see the stuffing and the bacon was wrapped around it.  Also, none of the stuffing fell out. I did have to broil after cooking to crisp up the bacon a bit.  I will definitely cut back on shallots next time as they  seemed to dominate.  I wish I had read the review that deglazed with the marsala before I made the dish.  I think that would have added a good finishing flavor.  Definitely a keeper recipe though.  Looks like more effort than it really is.",

Hubby loved it other then it was a bit to much on the onion/shallot flavor for him...he doesn't care to much for onions but I knew that going in. But he ate it all gone. And said it was a man's meat lovers meal. We loved the fact of the bacon infusing with the chicken and taking in that rich Wright Brand Applewood Smoked Bacon. I bought the nice thick premium bacon. And the chicken was tender. I did make up enough to fill 3 chicken breasts and I put a sear on the bacon when I removed it from the oven on the parts that didn't get crispy all the way. I will make this again for sure just knock hubby's down a notch on the shallots. My kids even in enjoyed what samples I was passing out. And wanted more...But darn there wasn't enough to go around to them.;-) Thanks for the additional help Laurrie on the taters for the side. Hugs!",
