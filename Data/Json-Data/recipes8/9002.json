The injector and instructions for frying came with our fryer which was a good thing because this original recipe didn't explain all the nuances of frying a turkey. It is well worth the learning process, though. We strain the peanut oil after it cools and pour it back into the containers (I bought it in gallon jugs). It will keep nicely in a cool place, under 40 degrees, or in the refrigerator until needed again.",

Add enough water until it is one inch above the turkey. Remove the turkey and basket from the pot. Measure the water level from the top of the pot. This is the amount of oil you will need to use to fry your turkey. If your water level is above the recommended oil level marked on the pot the turkey is too big and shouldn't be fryed. 12 lb or smaller turkey is recommended. This is less messy than measuring the turkey in the oil. Remember to thoroughly dry your turkey inside and out and dry the pot too. Never leave your pot unattended. Happy eating!!",

I just bought a 28qt. electric deep fryer and it recommended cooking at 400 though. Everything still came out perfect. I also added a little chipolte pepper and put on a cajun seasoning (mccoormick) rub on the skin and under the skin. I was asked to show up at my brothers house next week for a party he's throwing and do another one. Pretty cool for my first time. Thank you so much.",

After the appropriate time had elapsed I pulled the bird out of the oil and it was BLACK! Not dark brown but the color of your car tires. My first thought was \"I hope KFC is open today.\" I took it inside and put it on the table. Everyone looked at it with their mouth hanging open. Dinner was ruined. Finally my teenage nephew cut off a piece and tried it and said \"This is really good.\" He was right. It was the best turkey I had ever had. I realized I had made 'blackened turkey'. A few years ago the price of peanut oil went through the roof and the size of the container went from 5 gal to 3 gal. It would have cost me nearly 70 just for the oil and I said no more. My wife bought me an oil-less turkey fryer made by CharBroil. Instead of using 5 gal. of oil I now use about a handful to rub on the skin. It cooks just as fast and tastes almost the same with no danger of spilling hot oil or trying to figure out what to do with it after it cools down. I love it.",

Oil heated to 350 F. 3 1/2 minutes per pound (the bird will float when it is nearly done). Peanut oil isn't necessary unless you plan on cooking a whole bunch of them. Nor is injecting anything. Take a THAWED turkey (remove neck/giblets - pat dry - water is NOT your friend) trim off any excessive skin or fat shake salt and cayenne pepper all over the bird (for extra heat cover the insides with cayenne as well. Drop slowly into the heated oil (upright)and keep everyone away while it cooks (you would be surprised how normally intelligent people would reach in to touch the bird while it is in HOT oil). I always like to cook 10 - 12 # birds. I used a gaff to lift the bird when it was done let it cool before slicing it up. Always delicious. I used to have six cooking at once as many as thirty birds a night.",

For those looking for garlic juice and onion juice it can be found at most larger grocery stores just ask where to find it. In addition to following another reviewers advice I made only half which was enough for a 12 pound turkey. But I thought it would be too spicy with both hot sauce and cayenne so I skipped the cayenne and it was perfect for adults and children alike. I found it needed some extras so I added a few shakes of nutmeg 1 Tbsp of granulated onion and granulated garlic 1 Tbsp of prepared mustard and 1 tsp of ground mustard 1 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp chipotle sauce. We got rave reviews from the family!",
