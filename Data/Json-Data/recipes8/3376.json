I use fresh tomatoes often in here instead what the recipe calls for. I also use one cup of half and half and one cup of unsweetened almond milk or whatever milk you have on hand. The half and half adds extra flavor. I\u2019d cut the salt back to 1 tsp. But with those changes, I\u2019ve had rave reviews at brunches and when I made this at family gatherings.",

I used diced fresh tomato instead of canned tomatoes. I used garlic feta cheese instead of the basil since that is what I had on hand. But I would like to try this with various types of feta for variety. The texture was a little quiche-like with the bread on top and was light and airy which we like (but some may refer to it as spongy and may not like it). The type of bread does make a difference in the texture since part of it sinks down into the egg mixture instead of floating on top. Herbs such as the thyme makes this a different type of Omelette which we liked for a change. We had bacon strips along side it and my husband had seconds.",

OR..... you can add your own special touches if you are comfortable with cooking. They can be as simple as changing up the spices to your taste or changing the type of cheese to one you prefer to use or adding onions garlic or fresh tomatoesinstead of cannned. That is the beauty of cooking is you can find inspiration from a recipe like this and keep it the same or adapt to your families taste. For me I wanted to experience a fresh tomato flavour by using fresh tomatoes I added some green onions like a quarter cup but I went with spices I love like fresh dill and a teeny bit of oregano. The other CRAZY thing I did was toss my bread cubes in some melted butter before putting them on top! I dunno why just my indulgent side I guess. For some buttery richness! So Some May say I butchered this recipe but it was the best inspiration for my dinner tonight. I am grateful it was online and I that was able to customize it to MY flavour preferences. That s what the love of cooking is ALL about! If you are new to cooking I would follow the directions if you are experienced you know where you can tweak it! Happy cooking!",
