Cooked and cooked this, checked for gelling, and finally decided it won't happen unless you use real sugar.  However, it tastes amazing and my husband will be thrilled to swirl this into his morning yogurt. Might try throwing some pectin in if I make this again.",

The only thing I did differently was to add twice as much berries because I had two \u201cfat\u201dcups of figs that we pick off the tree this morning. Kept everything else the same using lemon vs lime, just seemed a better fit. I didn\u2019t smash the berries first because I figured the immersion would do them in anyway. I also simmered ten or fifteen minutes longer to get a thicker consistency. Thank you so much for sharing!",
