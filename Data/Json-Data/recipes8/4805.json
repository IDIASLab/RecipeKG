                "reviewBody": "I made a few adjustments based upon previous comments and my family preferences.  I used 4 oz less Alfredo sauce because the jars weren't the recommended size.  The Alfredo sauce was garlic flavoured plus I added an extra garlic clove.  To compensate for the lack of Alfredo sauce, I added 2 cups of whipping cream.  The seafood I added was lobster, crab and scallops although next time I would skip the scallops because they didn't add any flavour.  I also used two cups more cheese than called for.  The extra cheese and whipping cream made the lasagna moist but not runny after resting out of the oven for 6 minutes.  The next day the leftovers were still scruptious and had a wonderful texture.  I would recommend adding chopped spinach for some colour because the dish did look anemic.  My brunch guests were suitably impressed with this lasagna and I would certainly recommend this recipe.",

I prepared it on Saturday and stuck it in the refrigerater and then baked it the next day at 350 for 50 minutes covered with foil and then another 20-25 minutes uncovered.  It was wonderful!  That way I was able to enjoy my company and not feel exhausted from preparing this time consuming meal the same day.  I used the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce recipe from this site and it was delicious.  I had to alter that recipe to 6 servings rather than 4 to make enough alfredo sauce to get the 32 ounces called for in this recipe.  I also used real king crab legs rather than imitation and it was well worth the cost and time to crack them all open. And then I used a pound of medium shrimp and a pound of squat lobster chunks.  Next time I'll probably just do the crab and shrimp and forget the lobster.  I just happend to have that in the freezer and used it up.  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!",

I have learned to cut up my shrimp before adding it to the sauce (makes it easier to cut as well as eat) and I don't use the scallops. I buy lump crabmeat and a tub of \"italian 4 cheese blend\" shredded cheese from Sams/costco. One tub (4 cups)is enough if it is finely grated. This isn't cheap but it is very good.",
