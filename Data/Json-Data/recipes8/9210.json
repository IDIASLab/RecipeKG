The result is a cheesecake that is not as dense and smooth as a regular cheesecake. A delicious difference. I did make changes: I cut the amount of crust in half and it was just enough. I added 1/2 cup of mini Chocolate chips to the filling. And instead of whipped cream on top, I made a topping of 1-1/2 cups sour cream , 3 Tblsp sugar & 1 tsp vanilla. I spread it on the cake 15 minutes before it was done baking. Then I garnished the cake with chopped pistachios and mini Chocolate chips. Delicious!",

I don't have a spring pan, so I used (2) 9\" pie crusts. Split the batter evenly between them and cook for 90min. Follow the same cool down procedure mentioned in the recipe. 90min cook time will give you more of a creamy result. I have not tried longer bake times yet to see if you get that classic cake/ creamy cheesecake texture. Don't buy cheap Walmart pie crust. Use better crust from King Soopers or your local grocers, or of course you can make your own.",
