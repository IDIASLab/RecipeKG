I developed and make this recipe with my 6 quart Instant Pot DUO (and never received the burn error while making it in that pot), but have since done some trouble-shooting with an 8-quart Instant Pot. If you are making it in an 8 quart pot, you will need to add more liquid to the recipe (measure the water with the juice from the gandules can to 3 cups instead of 2.5). Everyone should also make sure to scrape the bottom of the pot thoroughly with a wooden or plastic spoon (deglaze) before sealing and locking the lid. Finally, if you get the burn error after the pot has reached pressure, do NOT release pressure and open the pot. Keep the rice in the pot for the remaining amount of time (17 total minutes under pressure) before hitting cancel to start the natural release process. When doing this, the burn error actually went away for me once and the countdown was still going as if nothing happened. The burn error came back mid-way through, but the pot remained at pressure (the pin stayed up the whole time). After the 17 minutes plus 15 of NPR, I released the remaining pressure with QR like normal, and the rice turned out perfectly and was not burnt. \n\nAdditionally, while this wasn\u2019t included in the instructions for the published recipe, it is normal for the rice on the bottom to browned or even crisp. Puerto Ricans call it \u201cPegao\u201d and it adds a great texture and flavor to the overa",

I also ended up not sealing it at all. After about 1.5 hours, the rice on top was still a bit raw & the bottom is burnt. I'm leaving it in the pot while it cools down - hoping that maybe it just needs more heating up so the rice on top will be softer.

I used my blender and it was so easy (1 green pepper, 1 medium onion, 1 full head of garlic, a few culantro leaves, and a tsp of oregano).  This made such a delicious base to my dish, it forgave the missing ingredients (salt pork-I just added extra olive oil, capers- I just let the juice from the olives go into the pot).
