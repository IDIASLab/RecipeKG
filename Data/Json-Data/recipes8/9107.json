        "description": "All these years I've thought Swiss steak was from Switzerland! It's not. Swiss is the treatment of the steak. It's the process of rolling or pounding the tough cut to make it tender. I've kept the \u201cSwissing\u201d technique and added my own flavors. It's pretty simple. The hardest part is cutting the veggies. You can't beat a long braise to make meat--cut-with-a-fork tender. Feel free to add your own twist! Serve it over egg noodles and with a crusty loaf of bread.",
