The whole family has really loved this.  I made it without using an ice cream maker.  I just poured the mixture into a metal bowl and popped it into the freezer.  Every couple of hours I whisked it until it was an even texture.  When it reached soft serve consistency, I put it into a a covered container and stored it back in the freezer.  We'll use this recipe as a jumping pad for other fruit sorbets for sure.  I'm envisioning pineapple-coconut, cantaloupe-mint, whatever happens to be in season!  Thanks Terry Wilson for sharing!",
