I used cocoa krispies (what I had on hand), and although the recipe tells you to work quickly, you do have to allow the mixture to cool down a bit because they\u2019re just too hot to roll in your hands coming right out of the skillet.  And even cooled a bit, I had no difficulty rolling, a 1-inch cookie scoop worked great  in shaping them.  I\u2019ve had this recipe saved for quite a while, and I\u2019m so glad I finally got around to making it.  Thanks for sharing Grandma Ziegler\u2019s recipe, it was good.",
