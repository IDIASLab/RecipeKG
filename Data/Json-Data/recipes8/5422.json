I think the original recipe would be super good too, just wanted to throw  some more things that we had.  Along with all the  listed ingredients I also added about 3/4 cup peanut butter to help it stick together and for flavor.  I didn't have any applesauce so I used shredded apple.  I only used 1 1/2 - 2 cups of the quinoa and 3 cups of oatmeal. They turned out moist but firm enough to eat like a granola bar.    Basically keep adding stuff until you get the flavor and consistency you like and smoosh it down firmly in the 9x13 dish. Will definitely be a staple in our house!",

I added all of the ingredients to the food processor as directed and while the ingredients close to the blade were chopped and mixed, the bulk of them sat undisturbed.  I ended up adding more applesauce, which allowed everything to blend into a gluey paste.  As anticipated, when I added the quinoa mixture to the remaining ingredients additional oats were required to get a decent consistency.  I ran out of oats and used a bit of granola.  I felt the result was still too moist and so ended up baking the bars for about 10 minutes.  As I mentioned, I grumbled a lot and felt the recipe was not well executed.  I decided to withhold judgement, however, until my 12, 17, and 22 year old sons gave me their votes.  They all 3 LOVED them.  One of them said it was like a Cliff Bar but better because it was moist.  The second and third times I made this recipe I ground the dates first and used about 3/4 of a cup of applesauce.  I baked them for about 10 minutes at 325 degrees.  They turned out beautifully and were a lot easier to make.  Nutritionally speaking, these are fabulous.  I have 2 athletes who need a lot of protein and didn't like feeding them the chocolate covered store-bought bars.  The core recipe is versatile and can be adjusted to suit your taste.  I added hemp hearts and additional coconut.  I made one batch of cherry walnut bars, and a second of peanut butter ch",
