He used a lot more onions that what I use, but that's a personal preference. I have also made it with onion powder or dried minced onion, and it's always good. It's great on a blustery fall or winter day with corn-bread.",

To reduce the fat and sodium content I made my own spicy pork sausage using a recipe submitted by Erika on AllRecipes.com and used Northern White Beans instead of butter beans (which my hub doesn't care for). The recipe was easy to \"lighten up\" by purchasing low-fat low-sodium canned baked beans and low-sodium BBQ sauce. To further reduce the fat I simply browned the meats then drained and rinsed with really hot tap water before turning back into the skillet. The best part was my hub had two helpings and never noticed a thing missing! Thanks for a keeper.",
