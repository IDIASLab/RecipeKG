I first tried these in St. Thomas - a restaurant/bar offered samples on the street and they SO hit the spot in the humid climate - was I ever hooked! Every time we return to the island we stop in to our favorite bar for a few of these then I take my hubby jewelry shopping..:-) I like to add some ice to mine to make them more like a milkshake which is the way they serve them at the Happy Buzzard in St. Thomas. Thanks so much for the recipe!",
