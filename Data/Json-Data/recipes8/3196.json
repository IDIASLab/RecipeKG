I did not have chile de arbol and used a combo of guajillo and ancho (...3 ancho and 9 guajillos I think) as that's what I had on hand. I wish the recipe specified the seasoning amounts to be used. In the future I would use 1/8 teaspoon for everything and use maybe 1/4 teaspoon of Mexican Oregano. However, I think it would be best to just add a light dash of each and taste as you blend the ingredients to see what it needs more of. Thank you for the recipe!",
