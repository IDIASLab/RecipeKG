If you can't find it, drain your ricotta on folded paper towels on a plate.  It makes your filling much firmer.  If you don't have a pestle and mortar, you can mix your pesto in a good blender.  Extra garlic never hurts, and saut\u00e9ing the zucchini before using does wonders for the dish.  Thanks for sharing.",

Maybe even longer. The mixture becomes very watery while baking.\n2. Cook the zucchini(while cheese mix is in the fridge). The zucchini does not get soft while in the oven - even with cooking 15 mins longer than suggested. Next time I will saut\u00e9e the zucchini strips til they are soft before assembling. \n3. As the other reviewer suggested, I added sauce and cheese to the tops of the zavioli, and I'm very glad I did. With the mixture becoming so watery there was no real sauce left in the bottom. \n\nOtherwise, very good low carb option. By my calculations, it added up to 3 WW smart points per zavioli. Less olive oil could be used to lower that number.",

I also recommend using 4 strips per Zavioli, this required 4 small zucchinis but made for easier wrapping and by placing them seam down in the baking dish there was no need for toothpicks (Yield: 15 large Zaviolis.) I was missing the ingredients for the pesto and omitted the egg (personal preference).  Instead, I cooked the spinach with minced garlic, pepper & Italian seasoning, drained well then mixed with light ricotta.  This paired amazingly well with Marinara.  I dabbed each Zavioli with Marinara and topped with some shredded Light Mozzarella and baked for an extra 5 minutes.   Unlike other reviewers I did not find it watery at all, though I did place strips on paper towel and drained the ricotta.  This was such a hit the only disappointment was the lack of leftovers!",

From there we seasoned the ricotta and actually used a 1 tbs water 1 tbs oil and 1 tsp baking soda as an egg substitute for vegetarians. We ensured the ricotta was cold when we combined everything and did not have any 'watery' issues when assembling. We used store bought pesto for ease and used long toothpicks pre soaked in water. We also sauteed the zucchini (yellow and green) lightly and seasoned with salt and pepper for added flavour. Looked very pretty and tasted amazing.
