I left out the half & half to save on calories. I then added another can of chicken broth a small can of green chilis & frozen corn. The soup was plenty thick with the corn tortillas. Oh I also added the jalapenos and cup of tomatoes to the mix rather than adding it after serving. Great use of leftover turkey! UPDATE: 11/30/2008. I made this soup again tonight (Thanksgiving leftovers again!). I added an entire box of chicken broth one diced jalapeno and a can of rotel tomatoes and left out the half and half. I also added a cup of frozen corn. We topped with sour cream shredded cheese and avocado slices. I'm pretty sure the corn tortillas are supposed to be mushy otherwise the recipe would have you add them just before serving. They serve to thicken the soup and add flavor. My husband and 7 year old had seconds--they love it!",
