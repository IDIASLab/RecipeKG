Tomato paste and oil mixed together before adding peppers?  I came up with paste spreading onto peppers, did I miss instructions for adding water to that wok (which I did)?  Ingredients not enough to make complete marinade, just enough to cover half the chicken.  This just took way too long to make.  At least it tasted good while fresh.",
