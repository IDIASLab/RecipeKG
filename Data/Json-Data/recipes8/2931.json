I followed the other recommendations to try baking it; I also substituted a thin layer of salsa for the green chilies since I forgot to purchase those at e store. Used a store brand raspberry jalape\u00f1o salsa; the little hint of sweet was awesome. I would recommend that the tortillas be chopped up before layering into the pan just because it was a little difficult to serve out of the pan with large pieces of tortilla especially if they overlap. Had to use a steak knife to make serving sizes and then on the plate it was a little difficult to cut up. We just had to take big mouthfuls which wasn't such a bad thing considering how tasty it came out!",
