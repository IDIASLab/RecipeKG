I did make some changes to the posted recipe. I used pink seas salt vs the standard table salt both in the recipe and also to top the cups. I prefer the taste of it and I like a bit of savory with my sweet. The salt plus the dark chocolate were a wonderful combination. I also used Almond butter vs Peanut Butter. Either will work that is just what I had available at the time.\n\nAs you can see from my picture I did not use cupcake liners. My wife had just recently bought silicone molds for another recipe and I wanted to try them out. It was a bit messy but it worked. If you are going to go this route place a little chocolate on the bottom of the mold, place a dollop of nut butter in the mold, then cover with more chocolate. Trying to paint the sides was ... well ... messy to say the least.\n\nI have since made these again and added chopped almonds to the nut butter for a bit more texture. I highly recommend these.",
