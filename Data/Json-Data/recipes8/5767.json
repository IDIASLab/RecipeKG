I scoop up a spoonful of dough with a soup size spoon and lay it on the cookie sheet and keep doing that until I have several spoonfuls of dough laying next to and touching each other in a very crude shaped log. Then I take a rubber spatula and push/pat it into a log shape about 10-12\" long, about 4\" wide and 1/2\" high (each log). This dough is very soft but will bake up into shape.

For some reason my silly brain read the directions as saying to bake the cookies at 400 degrees F so the loaves burned on the bottom after only about 19 minutes of baking and I had to throw them away. Fortunately I had enough ingredients to make a second batch. I reduced the temperature to 375 degrees F for the second batch and started checking the loaves after 10 minutes. At 18 minutes they were perfect. They sliced beautifully and the sides toasted nicely again at 375 degrees F. My dad loved the gift and my kids and fiancee even reaped the benefits because the recipe makes way more than my dad could eat by himself before they go stale. I'll definitely make these again AND I'll make sure I use the correct oven temperature next time!",

I have always used Bob's 1 to 1 gf flour for everything without a problem...except with this. The batter was NOT soft and sticky; it was crumbly sort of like making a pie crust dough and wouldn't stick together. I even tried to wrap it in plastic wrap in the fridge for a half hour but it still reminded me of not having enough shortening to bind it together. So I added some oil and viola' it sort of stuck together. I made round cookies instead of a log and they were alright. I sure could use some help.",
