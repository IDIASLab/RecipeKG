(Did I just say that??)\" Yes as most people will agree that bacon DOES make a good thing better but I don't think that this recipe needed it at all. The lovely fresh veggies are already snuggled in a warm smoosh of cheese and sour cream that I don't think the bacon really added anything other than an additional serving of guilt. Well no not really - we ate this up heartily. Children included. It reminds me of a Thanksgiving side dish that I've adopted from my grandmother's recipes that is squash and zucchini (no tomatoes nor french fried onions though) baked w/ mayo sour cream parm and Velveeta. Veggies made sinful! This WAS a great recipe though and we'll gladly make it again!",
