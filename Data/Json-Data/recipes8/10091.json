We will be eating this all week. Served both with, and in, the grilled fajitas we made. I also didn\u2019t think the corn in the oven made that big of an impact. I think leftover fresh, canned or frozen (thawed) would have worked so I will skip that step next time.  I also agree to use more chopped peppers, onions and jalape\u00f1o helps with both flavor and Mexican spin. Finally I think fresh cilantro would have been better than basil. While we did like this (4 stars for flavor and having a new Mexican side dish twist!) I am scoring three due to all the changes I would make for next time.  And yes, I would make this again (with changes)!",
