They do not taste like squash. If you don't have cotija cheese, you can substitute Parmesan. But cotija marries well with cumin. Serve with refried beans for extra yum.",

He requests it over and over again! We made quick work of shredding the squash by using a food processor otherwise you risk losing a fingertip or two. We've also made the tomato and avocado into guac and used that as a topping and it was yummy as well! This one's a definite keeper:) Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!",

My husband liked them with a bit of taco sauce on top. A great recipe Thank you Becky!",

EVER. 2) I added about 4-5 cloves of fresh garlic. 3) Used brown rice tortilla. 3. Used rice \"cheese\". We are vegetarian but I still eat eggs so I did not change that up.This did take some time to prepare everything but it cooked up rather quick and easy. And was just delicious. I also added some sweet chili pepper sauce to top off the flavors!! This is amazing!!",

A few days later I wanted to make it again but peeling the acorn squash was so difficult that I decided to omit it and used a sweet potato instead. I also didn't have another serrano chile so I used canned chopped green chiles. And since I was out of eggs I substituted flax seed and a few tablespoons water. And it was still great! Will definitely make again",

This recipe is now our second favorite taco recipe (right below \"Grilled Fish Tacos with Chipotle-Lime Dressing\"). I'm so glad we tried this! I prepped the acorn squash for peeling by poking holes in it (as you would for a potato) and microwaving it for 3 minutes. Peeling took a while and grating took a while so for us it was at least more like an hour start to finish. This is worth the effort though we will definitely make this again.",
