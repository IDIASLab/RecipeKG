I can't say for sure exactly how much but here's what i did: I cooked a pound of bacon. I took a couple slices and cut them into 1/2in-1in pieces. Then I put these pieces to the side. I took the rest of the bacon (minus the 2 or 3 pieces that got nibbled up) and crumbled it up and combined it with the egg yolk and ranch dressing. Once the deviled egg mixture was scooped into the egg halves I decorated them with a piece of bacon I had cut up.",
