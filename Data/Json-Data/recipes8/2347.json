Granted, it was 92 degrees yesterday but still......awesome recipe! I made no changes or substitutions. Next time, I might increase the berries but that's really just a personal preference. I think this would be awesome with strawberries or even blackberries, when the season starts. NOTE: I do not have popsicle molds because they never seem to work for me. What I do have are dixie cups and popsicle sticks. I just poured the mixture into the dixie cups that I'd set on a small plate, leaving 1/4 inch of room on the top and set them in the freezer. When they firmed up, I just stuck the popsicle sticks in each pop. This way is great because you could just peel away the cup and not have to worry about if the popsicles will come out of the mold. Which is always MY problem.",
