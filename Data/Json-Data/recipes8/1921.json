                "reviewBody": "These are really great muffins! Tasty, and shockingly fluffy for using whole wheat flour--I'm very impressed. I did use just regular whole wheat flour in place of the white whole wheat, and accidentally subbed baking powder for baking soda (oops). I would probably do that \"oops\" again because the resulting muffins were really light and fluffy. One other thing, is I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp--I think 1 full tsp would have been too much for my tastes. I used a suggestion from the recipe submitter's notes, and used a sort of \"cheater\" candied walnut topping in place of the candied pecan one called for here. I mixed together 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, 3 tbsps maple syrup, and about 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and topped the muffins with this mixture. It was so good! I also left some muffins plain, without any topping, and they were fantastic as well. I got 16 good sized muffins out of this, and they were perfectly baked in 20-22 minutes. Thank you for the recipe--these are delicious!",
