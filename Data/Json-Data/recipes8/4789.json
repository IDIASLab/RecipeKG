Another tip: let it sit for about 20 minutes after it's assembled and before you bake it to let the flavors really come out.",

I've added zucchini because it needed to get used. I think you could probably add chicken as well but I haven't felt like meat was necessary. We're not vegetarian's but don't eat a lot of meat.

I didn't use gorgonzola cheese as I didn't have it on hand so I just used mozzarella and sprinkled parmesan on the very top layer. I added ground beef (browned) to the recipe and mixed the pasta sauce in it. I also added zucchini and red bell pepper in with the portobello mushroom and all three complemented each other well. I covered my dish with aluminum foil and popped it in the oven for a half hour then removed the foil to let the cheese brown and cooked for another 10 minutes. The result is pure deliciousness. I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch this week!",
