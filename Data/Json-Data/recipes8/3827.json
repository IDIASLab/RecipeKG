The next time I will try to only cook them for 5 minutes.  Grilling them was what made them so delicious.  Nice and crispy on the outside.   You can also alter the spices to your liking.  Good recipe Nicole.  Thanks for sharing.",

Used large cookie sheet with sides, placed a rack from roaster on it, sprayed both with cooking oil. Placed potatoes on rack and baked for 10-15 mins until fork tested cooked. Much easier and clean-up a breeze!",
