It is cooked until very tender and it shreds, which is why it is called ropa vieja. Ropa vieja translates to ragged clothes or old clothes. It's very yummy, can be served over rice or even used as a filling.",

                "reviewBody": "This turned out really good. Note that the reciato is duplicated in the ingredient list. I used jarred but would like to make my own next time. Sofrito is easy to make but you can buy that jarred as well. The only thing I did a little differently was that after the roast was cooked I shredded it and crisped it up in a skillet. Just a personal preference is all. The green olives were a nice touch but I don't feel the carrots added anything. While the arepas are more than likely traditional they are a bit of a pain. Next time I'll save myself a step and just use tortilla's. Overall this is a good recipe with a lot of flavor and one I would make again.",

The capers gave that same vinegar/salt taste that olives do and I had them already because I use them in my family s Puerto Rican recipes often. Overall the flavor was great. I made 3 lbs of chuck roast and adjusted the seasonings and ingredients (other than the onion and diced tomatoes which I kept the same) to fit. The arepas were delicious! My 9 year old loved this recipe. Will definitely make again.",
