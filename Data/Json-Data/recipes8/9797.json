Crunchy, slightly sweet scones made with buttermilk and bits of banana are drizzled with a fabulous praline glaze. They really need no embellishment, though feel free to add some whipped cream, if you must!",

                "reviewBody": "The dough was far too wet to turn out after adding the wet ingredients and the banana. Perhaps it was because I use frozen bananas. I had to add about 1/2 C of additional flour before the dough would hold together.  I used self--rising flour, so I did not use additional baking powder, but I did add another 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda since I significantly increased the amount of flour. The result twas very tasty and light, with a good crumb and a high rise, but I would not call this a scone. It is more like a coffee cake. I am not like most who like a lot of gooey sweet stuff on my scones, so I cut the glaze recipe in half and it was enough for me. I'm sure most would like it with more glaze. This will not be filed under scones for me, but I will modify the recipe as I have described and file it under coffee cake.",
