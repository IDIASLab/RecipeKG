        "description": "I really love the convenience of cooking in the oven on a sheet pan, since you can do a larger quantity than in a skillet, and there is a lot less mess. These tasty, versatile chicken strips have no breading, so they are compliant for many different eating plans. With lots of fragrant spices and a personalized \"heat\" level, you can serve them with a dip as an appetizer, add some toppings and wrap in a flat-bread or tortilla, or serve in a toasted roll with remoulade for a taste of New Orleans. Coming in well under 30 minutes, they make a delicious addition to any meal.",
