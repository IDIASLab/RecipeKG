Usually made with cherries, this rustic French dessert adapts easily to any kind of seasonal fruit. If desired, brush top with warmed fruit preserves and honey and garnish with whipped cream, creme fraiche, or ice cream.",

This recipe has a lot less flour than an old recipe I use for cherry clafoutis and is much more like a custard than a cake.
