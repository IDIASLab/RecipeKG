I would only suggest adding tangerine zest to the cookie dough as in some traditional argentinian recipes. Other recipes call for using cooked egg yolks in the dough. Also if you don't have original dulce de leche you can make a very similar one by boiling a can of condensed sugared milk during at least 2 hours but BEWARE: cool off completely before opening!",

I had the same problem as a previous reviewer that they would crumble like sand when I would try to get them on the cookie sheet to bake.  I added 1/4 cup butter and 2 more egg yokes and it was perfect (I used Large eggs, maybe with Jumbo, the 3 the recipe would have called for would be fine).  I also followed other reviewers suggestions instead of using all lemon I did 1/2 of the lemon extract and zest and then the other 1/2 orange extract and zest.  I had no vanilla rum, so I just mixed 1/2 rum and 1/2 vanilla.    I used sweetened coconut, I think it tastes better.  When I take something to parties, I like taking something different, usually something that I grew up eating, this time it was the alfajores and they were a hit!  Thank you for the recipe.",

Flour and 1 2/3 c. Corn starch  (just switched the amount from the original recipe). And yes, that is CUPS of corn starch. Alfajores are not meant to be too cakey and should be kind of dense.\nI also used 4 whole eggs instead of 3 egg yolks, this may change depending on the egg size you use. If the dough isn't holding together when pressed, add egg or your cookies will be a crumbly mess coming out of the oven.\nFor the dulce de leche, which I can't find near me, I buy sweetened condensed milk 14 oz and make it in the microwave. Just repeat 30second heating and stirring, the milk will brown and stiffen up, go by texture for when to stop, it should be workable not runny, and you'll want to make the dulce de leche just before spreading it, because it will continue to stiffen a little. Be sure to buy two cans of milk if it's your first time, I went by color on my first batch , overcooked it and ended up with a bowl of hard caramel that took two days to soak out! \nHow you do the vanilla/vanilla rum is not too important, I use amaretto in place of vanilla rum and like the flavor. \nSame for the lemon, I don't like the strong flavor of lemon extract but they should taste a little lemony, I use lemon juice instead.\nAfter sandwiching them, I cover them in chocolate or powdered sugar like Havanas.",
