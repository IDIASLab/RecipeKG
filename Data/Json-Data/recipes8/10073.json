Other than my own fault of over-salting it, the recipe was very easy. The only other comment I have is even though I used all amounts called for in the recipe and same size tortillas, I was able to make 20 enchiladas (not 12) and still had leftover filling. Usually that might be a good thing, but that left me with no sauce for the leftover enchiladas. So in sum, I'd say the amounts are off.",

It did make quite a bit of filling. I cut the salt in half since the cheese and the enchilada sauce are both salty. I used half Cheddar and half Monterey Jack because that\u2019s what I had on hand. Super easy. Will definitely make this again.",

The tortillas were always too dry and would pull away from the filling.  This recipe taught me the secret to making the tortillas soft and like they are supposed to be....cooking them in butter first before assembling the enchiladas!  The recipe is indeed the \"ultimate creamy enchilada\" and the filling is delicious.  This is now my go-to for homemade enchiladas! In fact, going to make this using leftover Thanksgiving turkey.",
