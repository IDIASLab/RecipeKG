I did not have Orange Zest so I threw in some Orange Luquire (sp) I had already made a previous picture of Blue Maragaritas - and thought why not use this for the orange flavoring. They were GREAT; and so cool and refreshing. YUMMY - Great summer Maragarita.",

I make my simple syrup with stevia and leave in the refrigerator so I don't feel too guilty about adding as much as needed for a sweeter drink. May throw some fresh mint in next time and with all the melon I froze today there definitely will be a next time.",
