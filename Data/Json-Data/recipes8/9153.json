(there will be a next time) My family all said next time I should make them with Macadamia Nuts.  I also think a slight sprinkle of flaked salt will take the edge off the sweetness.

A note is to measure out all of the batter into portions of the size you want (I made them each .5 oz) as when it cools as batches are cooking, it becomes like caramel and is hard to measure. I suppose that is because it is caramel! I love Chef John's recipes and always look for his new ideas.",
