This recipe will give ya reason to be thankful you have too many cucumbers from your garden!  :D  I don't think ya can have too many cantaloupes, but cucs, you can.  :)   Oh, wait, it calls for watermelon!  Oops.  ;)  Yes, I subbed with cantaloupe.  I didn't have red onion so added green.   So good I may have to fix up a lessthanfivestar recipe like this.  Fruit & cucs are an unexpectedly delicious combination.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  One more thing!  Wait to add feta until serving - or get over it isn't as pretty as it once was.  :D  https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/169564/cucumber-and-cantaloupe-salad/",
