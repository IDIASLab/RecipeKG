The dough was a little sticky - previously, I had sprinkled some flour on it and the counter - use white rice flour for this instead, it won't alter the texture of the crust they way wheat flour does.    I use this crust both on a pizza stone and on a gas grill (see recipe for Pizza On The Grill II). When I bake this in the oven, I make two pizzas; on the grill, I use this recipe to make 12 small pizzas. I used to use corn meal on my pizza stone, but have found that wheat germ tastes better and is less gritty. This crust stays light colored after it is baked. Thank you for the great recipe, Marian!",

My crust used to come out like a led slate:( however with so many 5 star reviews I decided to give this one a shot and I'm glad I did!! I didn't have semolina flour but it didn't matter. I used easy pizza sauce III with this crust as did another reviewer and it was great and low fat! NOTE: I lost my bread machine manual but as a rule of thumb first the liquid then the dry then the yeast. I placed the oil and warm water first then the salt and sugar so it could dissolve then the flour and yeast. (Preheated the oven at 400) Then I split the dough into 2 pieces and made 2 deep dish pizzas (using 2 cake pans) and lightly oiled the crust with olive oil before I put on the sauce and cheese and saugasage. The crust was light and tasty. I can't wait to make calzones or bread sticks next. This recipe is definilty a keeper!!",
