Had to improvise on ingredients to use what I had on hand such as vanilla almond milk with vinegar instead of buttermilk, Crisco butter flavor instead of butter. 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 cake flour. Used raspberry preserves instead of peach and added 1/2 tsp almond extract. The cake came out nice and light. Delicious. Will definitely make again.",
