I had almost 1.5 pounds of ground chicken and 1/2 pound of ground country pork sausage. I cooked the (3) carrots and (medium red) onion in chicken stock instead of beef. I also added about 1/2 cup of dry oats since it seemed like it was a little too loose. And for the topping I used cream of mushroom soup with the balsamic vinegar and a tablespoon of grainy stone ground mustard. I served it topped with sliced mushrooms that were sauteed in butter seasoned with basil oregano garlic and worcestershire sauce. Absolutely marvelous!!",

As a mom to 6 somewhat picky eaters I am hesitant about trying new recipes but my husband found it so we decided to try it. The only change I made was with the vinegar. I only had apple cider vinegar but it still came out delicious. While cooking in the oven the grease did spill over so I think next time I will put it in a bigger pan. Overall it was a great recipe! I will be making it again very soon. Thanks for sharing!",
