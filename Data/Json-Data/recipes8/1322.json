I was scared I ruined them, but the end result was delicious & fluffy even with the added flour and all the extra help from the kids! We let them rise for close to 2hrs after placing in muffin tins before baking, simply because we went out to play. Reminds me of the ones from Goldilocks! Thanks for the recipe!",
