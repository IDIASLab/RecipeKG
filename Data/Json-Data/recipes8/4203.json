I added more butter when I added the cabbage. After I drained the noodles, I added all the incredients in the stockpot and it came out great! Of course, it's not a heart-healthy dish since you are using bacon grease and butter for seasoning, but still yummy! I will make again.",

One of the couples there were both from Poland. He was born there but was brought to America as an infant. She grew up there only leaving when she met her husband while he was visiting his grandparents. She prepared halushka pierogi and some type of delicious meatballs. Her halushka did not have bacon in it. Instead she sauteed onions leeks and garlic with the cabbage in clarified butter. Then she added stock or water with the egg noodles and cooked it until the noodles were done and the water or stock was reduced. She then just before serving or even at the table stirred in sour cream. This is how she shared her recipe and it took me several tries until it tasted like hers. Maybe no bacon since it was served with meat? It is though the best kind of comfort food.",
