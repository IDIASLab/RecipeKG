                "reviewBody": "The flavor is definitely tasty and yes it does have a kick! The execution however is lacking. The dressing isn't really dressing...it's a thick guacamole-like consistency. I highly recommend NOT using coconut oil. The reason: you have to melt the oil to get it into a liquid consistency. As soon as you add in your lime juice (if it was kept in the fridge) the whole thing firms/seizes right up because the lime juice is cold. I had to thin the dressing with about 2tbsp of warm water to get it to a manageable consistency again. And then even if I had started with room temp lime juice once I mixed the dressing into the salad and it came into contact with the cold kale and cucumber it clumped right back up. The result was a curdled-looking \"dressing\". Not pretty. While the coconut oil adds a nice flavor it just isn't practical in this recipe and I would recommend using olive oil or another neutral oil instead. Also I prefer to \"massage\" the kale for a few minutes by rubbing it between my fingers to soften it up a bit - unless you like tough kale. I might play with this recipe a bit to get it to my liking. Thank you for sharing your recipe bmwmom.",
