I otherwise followed the recipe, adjusted the serving size to 6 servings, and it took longer to bake than stated.  45 minutes covered, and another 45 uncovered.  It's so versatile to use whatever you want!  Tip - potatoes must be dry!!  So if you're using thawed frozen potatoes, press with paper towels to remove all of the water.  Fabulous recipe!!",
