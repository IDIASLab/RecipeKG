You want a clean and bright lemon flavor with some creamy texture. Two eggs are plenty for the amount of soup here, three should be the limit. But most important,  don't start mixing the eggs and lemon sauce, and tempering it with stock, until AFTER  the orzo or rice  is cooked to your taste. Only then do you take the pot OFF the heat. After the avgolemono is incorporated, take a clean kitchen towel, top the pot, then put the lid on, so that the condensed water droplets don't mar the sauce. Let the soup sit like that for a few minutes.",
