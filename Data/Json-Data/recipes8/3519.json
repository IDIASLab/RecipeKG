Fry your own corn tortillas or use soft warm flour tortillas.Just be sure to have tortillas ready to fill before you fry fish or if baking fry while fish is in the oven. Those pre- fabs are disgusting! I Know the tortillas take time to do yourself and it is a bit tricky but with a little practice you can do it. The fresher the tortilla the easier to handle. So if you don t have a tortilla deli near you when selecting corn tortillas try for the package that the tortilla will \"flop\" when held upright. Older ones are stiff. So worth the extra effort.",
