If I were to make again I'd try it with no oil and replace it with more vinegar and water. I tasted this after cooking was complete and thought it was totally bland. I added a little more vinegar a little sugar and mixed in a paste made of equal parts dry mustard and water which did elevate the flavor but I still can't say that I would make this again. I've eaten many types of German potato salad actually have several recipes in rotation and this one just didn't work well for us.

Finally, I made a roux out of the bacon grease per another recipe with 1/3 cup of flour and some water and added it in.  It was great.",

I've never been a fan of vinegar but this recipe has me reevaluating that. I just made it again after only making it last week. Something about the simplicity and balance of all the flavors. Perhaps it could do with a little less oil but I think it's an important part of the mix- it gives it a bit of a sauce to allow the onions peppers bacon and parsley to scoop and spread over the potato. The next time I make this (and there will be many next times) I'll put the celery back in the mix- I'm sure that will lend a little twist to it.",
