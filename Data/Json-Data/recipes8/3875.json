I also have replaced the mayonnaise with plain yoghurt in the dressing.  You may want extra strawberries and more spinach than the recipe states for 2 servings.  Also, a touch of sugar in the dressing can be nice if you like things sweeter.  Enjoy!",

The dressing is awesome but I always look at how can I cut the fat or calories and maintain the full flavor or even bump it a bit. I did this recipe just as described but I swapped out the milk for fat free half and half and added just a dash of water. I also used Mayo which is Olive oil based (Green lid by major brand) cutting all the saturated fat and cutting down on the non-saturated by about half. Last thing I did was to zest the lime with a micro-plane making the finest zest possible and added it to the dressing. Hope that helps for those of us who try to cut out as much fat as possible!",
