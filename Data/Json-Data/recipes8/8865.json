Turned out perfect using an Italian bread loaf. Cut the loaf down the middle and brush the olive oil on each half, place right on grill for only a minute to toast. Remove the bread and cut into smaller slices and place on a foil lined metal cookie sheet, top with the tomato mixture and cheese. Cook over indirect heat at 400\u00b0 until the cheese melts. Took about 12 minutes. I just drizzled the oil and vinegar over my tomato mixture, but doubt it was anywhere near 1/4 cup each, still very refreshing flavor after sitting for an hour.",

I followed the recipe using all the ingredients; but, because I wanted a cold appetizer, I used the mozzarella as a garnish rather than melting it in the oven.  I only used the flesh of the tomato not the seeds or juice.  When it first got done, I was very disappointed in the taste.  I just didn't like the pepper, it was too strong. (Perhaps my fault)  After refrigeration of a few hours, it was \"knock your socks off\" good!  All the flavors blended and it was totally delicious!  I served the bruschetta separate, as I didn't want the bread to get soggy.   I will be using this recipe often, infact I'll be making it again tomorrow.  Thank you Joy for sharing!",
