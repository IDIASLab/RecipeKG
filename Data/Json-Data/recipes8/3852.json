Overall, I would say this is definitely something you should make if you want your husband to look at you like you are a domestic goddess:)",

The only issue I ever had was that the sauce turned out with a pink/purple hue to it when using the red port. But I ran across a white port and decided to use that in this recipe instead. I served it with sauteed boneless chicken breast filets and although the white port is a bit lighter than the red it was absolutely fabulous!! My husband and guests loved it!! What a wonderful and versitile recipe for both chicken and beef!!",

I was making the same mistake and my husband came in and brought it up to a rolling boil (which the recipe does not tell you to do) to cook off more of the alcohol and then we turned it back down to a simmer. It truly made all the difference!!! Very rich flavor - I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!",

I added about 1 cup of Parmesan cheese 1/2 cup chopped spring onion some garlic and pepper and a dash of salt to taste. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I served this over artichoke-stuffed ravioli and it was a huge hit! The color of the sauce itself isn't appetizing but the addition of spring onion and basil over ravioli adds other colors which helps. So rich that I would only make it to share with guests so I don't kill just my hubby and me with calories. Will definitely try this again. Thanks!!!",
