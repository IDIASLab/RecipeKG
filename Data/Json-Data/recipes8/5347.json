I put an apple in the blender to make apple sauce (as another review suggested) reduce the almond milk to 1 1/3 cups and use mini dark chocolate chips. I have made this recipe a few times and usually get 6-7 crispy dense waffles. They are great even without syrup so any leftovers make a nice breakfast on the go. You can make your own oat flour by blending rolled oats and bread flour by adding 1 tbsp wheat gluten to 1 cup(minus 1 tbsp) all purpose flour.",
