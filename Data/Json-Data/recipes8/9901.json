A sweet amalgamation of banana pudding and peanut butter pie, this dessert has &ldquo;crowd favorite&rdquo; written all over it. Be sure to note that the recipe calls for a deep-dish pie plate, as the filling would overfill a standard pie dish. Top with crumbled wafers and banana slices, as desired.",
