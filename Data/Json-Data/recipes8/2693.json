I added a package of ramen noodles (saw that someone added extra veggies) to take up some of the liquid. We didn't have corn tortillas but I used flour. We broke them into smaller pieces to put into the soup. They really made a huge difference! It was like adding crackers and having them stay crunchy. This recipe is a definite keeper!",
