Like many of the reviewers I always add some sugar to this. I also add a splash of balsamic vinegar or red wine (or both!). I usually omit the onions unless I adding meat to it but that is because my daughter is a purist and can find a microscopic piece of onion in her food.:) If you have fresh basil available I absolutely recommend using that instead of dried. I take advantage of the summer basil and fresh tomatoes by making huge batches of this sauce each year and canning it for use throughout the year. The variations I just described are what go into the jar. I then add whatever we are in the mood for when I heat it up (roasted red peppers meat onion etc). As a starter I still think the recipe as posted is a great starter recipe. The great thing with this kind of sauce is that you can get creative and find new ways to dress it up. Enjoy!",

I had original rotel but did not have the bigger can of rotel crushed tomatoes so I substituted what I had which was a can of four cheese spaghetti sauce. I used one and a half tbsp of basil and half of a tbsp of oregano because while my family likes seasonings we are partial to oregano and I was honestly worried three tbsp would be too much for us. I used 1/8 cup sugar as others AND the OP suggested a few dashes of red wine vinegar (the OP suggested balsamic vinegar or some red wine or both so I subbed for this) and I also threw in some sweet Italian sausage diced bell pepper and only 1/2 of one small onion diced. THIS WAS SUPERB. This sauce as a base was a perfect starter and the flavors marry so well after simmering for that:30. Omnomnom",
