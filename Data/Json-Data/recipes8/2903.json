I fried the corn tortillas and then dipped them in the verde sauce then followed the recipe the rest of the way. Our 2yr old loved them so much he asked for a second enchilada. I served this with a side of black beans and lime wedge. Pretty delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe these recipes help me to improvise. Took me just 35 minutes to make the whole meal.",
