It was a little soupy, so I thickened with flour, but it made it perfect over pasta (I didn\u2019t have egg noodles). Of course the key is getting a good browning on your chicken which gives the sauce it\u2019s flavor. I also added a bit of sugar, as I used a dry Traminette which made the sauce somewhat acidic (the author didn\u2019t specify, but most Riesling\u2019s in the US are sweet). This was delicious and a definite make again!",
