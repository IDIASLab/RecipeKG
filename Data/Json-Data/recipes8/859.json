I only put in 6 eggs because that\u2019s all I needed and I made sure to use the same amount of water. I set the pressure cooker to four minutes and sealed the valve. I accidentally let it go for one minute longer before I released the steam. I followed the rest of the recipe completely and mine came out great. I would stand and watch it to prevent that minute of cook time if I make it again. I can\u2019t see why I wouldn\u2019t use this recipe in the future. It was extremely easy and a very tasty result was the outcome. Not to mention the peel method was extremely effective and effortless. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll make it again.",
