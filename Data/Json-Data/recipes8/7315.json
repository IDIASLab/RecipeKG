I have made it with peach jam which was too sweet and finally found the plum jam - which was worth looking for - it really made the recipe. I have made it according to the directs and I have made it as a layered casserole when I felt that stuffing the chicken would be to time intensive. It adapts well to a cardiac diet by using low fat/salt plain cornbread and turkey bacon. I stand by my recommendation that you use a savory cornbread - not a sweet cornbread for the stuffing. Overall a great dish!",

I put salt and pepper on the breasts before browning them and added the garlic to the stuffing as suggested below. I think the plum jam really makes it so I highly recommend it if you can find it. I just got it in the regular grocery store by the regular jam but you might also try the Asian food isle. But here is a yummy update! For Thanksgiving try using turkey breasts instead of chicken and cranberry preserves instead of plum jam I did this last night and it was very very good if you are just having a small Thanksgiving dinner for 2 or 4 why cook a whole bird? Enjoy!",

My boyfriend loved loved loved the stuffed chicken but he didn't have any of the sauce. I thought that it was okay... next time I will purchase boxed cornbread stuffing.
