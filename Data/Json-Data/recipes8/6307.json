BBQ trick - wrap your serving plate with plastic wrap before putting raw meat on it. Once you put your meat on the grill remove the plastic wrap and your plate is now safely ready to put the cooked meat on!",

If I am supposed to rely on a dipping sauce why bother marinating it in the same thing? Weaving the bacon on the skewer was a different idea though. I liked it but it just didn't have the big flavor that was expected.",
