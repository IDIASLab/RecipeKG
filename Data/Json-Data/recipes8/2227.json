Fresh salty sweet and tangy all at once. I wanted to reproduce the salad found this recipie and it's very close! The only alteration I made was to cut back on the amount of mint. I used 1/4 c. flat leaf parsley and about 10 mint leaves. Many guests have been surprised and delighted by this salad at our summer dinner table.",

I have lots of favorites on Allrecipes but this maybe close to the top! Thanks for the recipe!",
