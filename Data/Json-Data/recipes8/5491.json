What is the point when a pot or cup of coffee can be made and refridgerated. To top it would not have to be hand strained. I may have tried something like that in college before I had a coffee pot. Maybe a little more explanation on this would have been helpful. It would be rather time consuming to make the coffee ice cubes and then the cold brewed coffee separately. I have a very favorite iced coffee from the site that specifies the amount of milk amount too and it comes out perfect. I had some tiramisu flavored coffee I made into ice cubes and decided to try it with this. I used less sweetener than suggested but iced coffee really needs milk or cream in it. I can't see how that is an optional ingredient. It just tastes like coffee with ice cubes without it. Any iced coffee made at home still beats paying for it at a coffee shop. Try flavored coffee it worked pretty well in it anyway.",
