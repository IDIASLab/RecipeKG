My jalape\u00f1os were really big and long so instead of setting the sausages into the cream cheese I processed the two together then filled the peppers. I didn't have bacon but did have a pkg of real bacon bits so I turned the peppers upside down into the bits. I intended to brush with BBQ sauce before doing the bacon but forgot so I used that for dipping. Unfortunately my jalape\u00f1os were totally without fire so that element was missing. I will play with this again with smaller peppers and might add green onions and cilantro to the cream cheese.",
