I was missing some ingredients so I used 1tsp smoked chipotle Tabasco sauce and 1/2tsp red pepper flakes instead of jalape\u00f1o peppers and instead of the celery I added more onion and some celery salt. To lower the cholesterol I used margarine and omitted the cream. It still turned out creamy even though it was 100% vegan! I would love to taste it with carrots from a smoker! The flavors are quite good.",

(just learning) I used 2 whole serranos and holy cow it was literally hurt me good smoking hot. I blended twice but didn't strain. As I reached into the fridge for the cream I happened upon the goat milk/buttermilk combo from my failed chevere making experiment. I took the notion to see how that would be in the soup. My taste sample was crazy good so I used 2 cups of the combined milks tasting as I added. It was plenty thick enough as it had reduced a good bit. This was CRAZY GOOD. 5 stars for the taste before I added the goat milk and 5 stars with my changes. The kiddo didn't care for it but she's funny with cooked carrots plus it was a bit too hot for her. She can have raman when I indulge in this delight. THANK YOU PappaB.Mc!",

Here's what I did: 1 1/2 lbs of grated carrots 1 onion but added onion powder 1 1/2 T EVOO 4 cloves of garlic 3 stalks of celery no tumeric 2 t curry powder 1 t cumin powder no butter 4 oz cream cheese 1 t smoked paprika 1/4-1/2 t South African smoked pepper kosher salt 2 lg boxes of low sodium veggie broth. I followed the recipe on prep except the roasting part. I used my immersion blender to puree carrots & blend in the cream cheese. I will definately make this again. Love the 'fall' color the smoky flavor with a curry kick. Thanks for the recipe.",
