I halved the recipe and made 16 rolls that I divided between two 9-in cake pans. The recipe does not state the oven temperature. I baked at 325, and mine were perfectly done in 25 minutes. They were just a little lacking in flavor for us, and I think a tad more salt would have helped with that. We gobbled them down with butter spread on them. Thanks for the recipe. I will try these again sometime.",

At that temp, they probably should have come out of the oven somewhere around 20-24 minutes; mine were just a bit on the crusty side.  These rolls were OK, and they\u2019ll be eaten, but I thought the flavor was a little flat and didn\u2019t find them light and fluffy (but that could be attributed to being in the oven too long).  I halved the recipe, ended up with 20 rolls, and most of them will be heading to the freezer today.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
