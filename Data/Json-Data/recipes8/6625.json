Depending on how sweet your berries and if you use NF plain yogurt, you may not need the extra sugar at all. NOTE: If you don't keep paper cups on hand all the time, you can save your Snack Pack cups, fruit cups or yogurt cups from previous meals and re-use them for the cups for your pops. Better for the environment and you can use them again and again. Also, if you've got issues with finding a flat surface in your freezer to keep these from tipping and spilling, place them on a baking sheet or flat plate before sticking them in the freezer.",
