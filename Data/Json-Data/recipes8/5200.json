I cut the recipe in half, using 3 tortillas and one 8-oz. cream cheese, but I used almost 1/4 pound each of the meats and cheeses and about 3/4 of a 16-oz. jar of store-bought muffuletta salad (olive salad). Like I always do when making pinwheels, I cut the rounded edges off the tortillas to make them square before I spread on the cream cheese so there's less waste. These were very quick and easy to make and tasted great....a lot like a muffuletta sandwich, but less filling. My guests loved them.",

I made it exactly as posted but the quantity of olive mixture was WAY less than shown in the video.   Double the olive amounts to get something resembling the video.  As is, you get tiny dots of olive mix on each tortilla.  The cream cheese amount is spot on.  The meats and cheeses were a little scanty compared to the video so I'd increase these by 1/2 if I made this again.",
