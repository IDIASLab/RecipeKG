With that said we thought this was a very tasty dinner. Next time I'd omit the onion and replace it with onion powder since I couldn't taste the onion & you don't wind up eating it anyway why waste an onion when onion powder would work better? In the future I would used dried lemongrass. I can hear the purists squealing now but honestly...I couldn't taste it. Most of us don't live in a place where fresh or frozen lemongrass is available; mine was in those little plastic boxes in the produce section and I think it was inferior. I'm also not sure I'd use turmeric again. It stained my fingernails a weird pumpkin color:) (It'll wash off!) Lastly I did not pound my chicken I just cut it into strips and let my husband sort out the cooking times (ha!). Overall we enjoyed this recipe thoroughly thanks for posting!",
