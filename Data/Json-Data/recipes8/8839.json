It was a hit and my DH said he would be happy to have this every couple of weeks.  We will definitely be eating this again.",

And its a good crockpot recipe-which I am always trying to find a good crock pot recipe. If you want you can butterfly the chicken boneless chicken breast and stuff it with the ham & cheese. Or you can pound the breast flat and roll the ham & cheese in the chicken and lay it in the crockpot with the seal side down so that it doesnt come undone (use a toothpick if you are nervous about it-just besure to remove it before serving). And cook it that way. This isnt a bad recipe but I needed to add garlic and leeks to the pot. I live for spices. I will make it again and most likely butterfly the breasts and stuff them. But next time I may add some white wine to the mix.",
