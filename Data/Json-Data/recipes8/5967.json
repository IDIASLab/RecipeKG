I added the amount of beef broth listed, but did not add more water to cover the roast.  When cooking was complete, I ended up with a pot of beef-flavored broth, not even close to resembling even a thin gravy.  There was so much liquid that if I\u2019d  simmered until the liquid evaporated, the veggies would have been total mush. I used Wondra\u00ae to make the gravy, and this turned out tasting very good, but if I were to make again, I\u2019d cut back the amount of beef broth.  It just seemed to be too much even without the additional water.  I\u2019m rating 4 stars based on the flavor because it was a tasty pot roast.",
