                "reviewBody": "My husband and I really enjoyed this cake--it's got a great flavor, texture, crumb, moistness, and it pairs perfectly with a cup of coffee. The almond streusel is absolutely delicious. In the future, I think I'd either use less sugar in the cake, or leave off the icing, as I found it a touch too sweet (that's just a personal taste preference though), and I'd also include some cinnamon and nutmeg in the banana cake portion of the recipe. I found that when layering the cake and streusel in the pan before baking, that 1/4 cup of the batter was not nearly enough to get a complete layer over the streusel--so I just dolloped enough batter to cover each layer (probably closer to a 1 cup of batter each time), and my cake ended up only needing 60 minutes to bake. I made the icing a bit thicker (and used heavy cream in place of milk), and applied it when the cake was cool just to make for a nicer appearance. Overall, this is a pretty tasty cake, and it was fun to make. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
