        "description": "If you're looking for a fun way to use up a few ripe, summer peaches and you happen to enjoy having cake for breakfast, this recipe is for you. Fresh peach slices are simmered on the stovetop with brown sugar and cinnamon to form a gooey peach cobbler-inspired filling that you'll layer into rich sour cream coffee cake batter. The cake is then capped with an iconic cinnamon-sugar pecan crumble topping before baking into a coffee cake that's too good not to share. And you'll have plenty to go around, as this decadently dense, moist 9x13-inch coffee cake is perfect for a crowd.",

But I looked through your profile of recipes and seemed like you know what your talking about, so I made it.  \n\nAnd I'm glad I did! It was AMAAZING! I don't have a paddle attachment so I just mixed using a wooden spoon. And then I misjudged how much 2/3 of the batter was so I ended up doing about 80% batter then, the filling and I somehow managed to smooth the remaining 20% on the top and then put the crust on top. And It surprisingly worked out Great!",
