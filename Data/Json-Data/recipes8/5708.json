I made sure not to use anything higher than 92% lean though for my burger tends to fall to pieces!!! Thanks for the submission and I hope others give this recipe a try just like it is!!!

The only thing I did differently was to use a separate pan for the veggies and realized too late that doing it in the same pan would've given them a bit more flavour. What would make this a five star recipe for me would be to have a nice gravy type sauce to top the veggies with and also make sure you season the hamburgers otherwise they're a little bland. I used a little onion and garlic powder but it could've used more for my tatse. Still a great dish and will be making again for sure.",
