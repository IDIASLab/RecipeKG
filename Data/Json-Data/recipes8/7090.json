I thought: I think this has to taste good and go well with my baked grouper dinner...and it was not only good but great! The mild bitterness of the arugula and the sweetness of grapes and pickled veggies is a perfect combination. A cool crisp pinot bianco is the perfect match.",

I used a blend of arugula/baby spinach/herbs that was prepacked by the store. The grapes really made this salad pop. I look forward to making this salad again. It was a nice diversion from another plain tossed garden salad. The dressing was good with the blend but not very good by itself. Thanks for a great salad Rodrigouno.",
