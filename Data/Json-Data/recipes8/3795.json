Oh...except I used frozen peas that i rinsed under cold water and let drain really well.  I served really cold and I wouldn't change a thing.  Maybe experiment with cheese as I think pepper jack might be really good but as is with mild cheddar it is yum yum tasty, and something different.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.",

So I easily adapted it into a pasta salad. I had already chopped some pickles and carrots so I threw those in. I ended up using only 1/2 c of peas. Turned out great. I agree with other reviewers to wait until the end to add the bacon. Quick, easy, and budget friendly. Served with cheeseburgers and potato chips. Looking forward to taking leftovers for lunch tomorrow",
