Easy fix - after you are all done baking, drain the liquid, set aside 1/2 cup and put the rest  into a small pot.  Whisk the 1/2c liquid with 2 TBL cornstarch until thoroughly combined then whisk it slowly into the rest in the simmer pot.  Simmer for a few minutes and you'll have a nice thick sauce!\n\nI doubled the sauce recipe and used a 12-thigh pack.  Cooked up some Jasmine rice, added fried egg and broccoli and mixed in some of the sauce!  Perfecto!",
