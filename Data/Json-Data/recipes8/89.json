Or should I say, 'causa' a stir, since in Peru that's what this gorgeous dish is called. Infused with aji amarillo, lime juice, and cilantro, these are perfect for making ahead and packing in your cooler on a hot summer day. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and cilantro if desired.",

I got the aji amarillo chili paste online from the retailer that begins with a W. The aji gives it a unique zing with a smoldering heat that does not present initially. The dish is an unusual blend of flavors and textures that really work well together. I used 6 oz ramekins and had enough for 6 servings. The dish is labor intensive with many steps (and lots of dirty dishes) but I would say it was worth it. It was excellent!",
