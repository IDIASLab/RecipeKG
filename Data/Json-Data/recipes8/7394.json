Full disclosure, I didn't stick to the recipe exactly as far as the cooking method, but I did stick to the ingredients list other than subbing garlic salt for regular salt.  Rather than adding milk (I left it out) and pan-frying, I upped the parmesan to 1/4 C and ran all of the ingredients through the food processor.  I spooned the mixture onto a greased baking sheet and flattened into nugget-like shapes.  I baked for 15 minutes at 350 and then flipped the nuggets and baked for an additional 15 minutes before serving with a dipping sauce made of sour cream (the bacon and green onion flavors reminded me of a baked potato!), sriracha, black pepper, and a tiny bit of lemon juice.  Delicious!",
