Also, my original recipe does not instruct you to flake fish with a fork. You can do that to test doneness, but then the breading will be a little messed up in terms of appearance/presentation. If you have a meat thermometer or probe, the fish is cooked through when internal temp reaches 140-145F. Maybe the Allrecipes gods will see my review and update my recipe accordingly, but if not, I hope these minor details help and that you enjoy this recipe!",
