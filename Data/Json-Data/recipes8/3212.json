I would definitely tweak this if I were to make it again. This would benefit from some vegan cheese in the filling or melted over top or even some vegan sour cream (made with cashews). As is the enchilada sauce was overpowering. Be sure to use a good quality sauce or homemade as suggested. I used a red enchilada sauce but think I'd probably prefer it with green. This also makes a lot of filling...way too much actually. I filled each tortilla with 3 tablespoons (equal to 9 teaspoons) instead of the 4 teaspoons stated in directions and still had filling left over. Also even though I finely chopped the onion (using my food processor) there were still some uncooked pieces which was unpleasant.",
