We added a bit of fresh rosemary to the sauce BEFORE reducing it - I think it added a terrific flavor.  Also omitted any added salt since the broth is salty (used 99% fat free).  Did not grill the sirloin tip but cooked it in the oven and it turned out great.  Will absolutely make this again!",

Only used 2 4\" portabella caps, that was plenty. This was the perfect companion for a candlelite dinner and a bottle of good wine. Thank you.",

We used this over sirloin steaks, and it worked out great.  Preparation was easy and the kind of thing you can have on the stove while multitasking preparation for something else!   I used plenty of garlic -- probably quadruple what the recipe called for.   I used cornstarch instead of flour for thickening, and I would NOT recommend doing that -- it made it a bit too gooey.  Next time I will definitely try flour.  Great overall though!",

After I mixed in the ingredients the computer comes back up and wouldn't you know I had combined two different recipes. I will be posting the same review for both because it worked great. I used regular portabellas and used no flour in this recipe. I think the sirloin maybe was a little dried out and next time I wouldn't brown as long as I did. However the sauce was great when combined with the other recipe (see reviews). Went great with Yellow Tail Shiraz Cab and I actually used a straight Shiraz instead of burgundy in the recipe. Very good recipe.",
