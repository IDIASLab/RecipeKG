Used 3/4 tsp crushed red pepper instead of jalapeno.  Next time I might cut back to 1/2 tsp.  I used 2 tsp chopped garlic from a jar.  I suggest using chunky salsa that is refrigerated at the store.   I also added a bit of brown sugar to the salsa to pacify some of the acidity of the tomatoes.   I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta.  Makes the cheese layer so much easier to spread.  The recipe makes a large casserole and it does freeze well.  BIg hit with my husband and neighbor.",
