                "reviewBody": "I had some challenges for our dinner tonight.  I\u2019m in Naples now but I\u2019m going home in another day, so I wanted to come up with something using ingredients I already had.  I didn\u2019t want to go to the store for MORE stuff, nor did I want anything wasted.  Also, I\u2019ve got limitations, because of Hubs\u2019 sensitive innards, with heat and spice, both of which I generally have to eliminate.  With a little research it became apparent that jambalaya, which I\u2019ve never had before, was the way to go.  I came across a lot of good recipes for it, but none so simple, so straightforward, so uncomplicated, as Cindy\u2019s.  Some reviewers commented her recipe was a little weak on spice \u2013 first, that\u2019s a GOOD thing for Hubs' innards and, second, that\u2019s easy enough to fix, right?  If you want more spice, add more spice!  I decided on this recipe but knew I would make a couple of small changes \u2013 I would cook the rice separately, only because I make every attempt to limit the amount of starch I consume.  And I used fresh, chopped, red-ripe tomatoes instead of canned.  This was, in a word, delicious.  Hubs, SO stingy with 5-star ratings, gave this an immediate 5.  Weak spice? Maybe a little \u2013 but Hubs just sprinkled a little extra Zatarain\u2019s Creole Seasoning on his serving to his liking.  I thought it was just right. When you\u2019ve got great flavor, you don\u2019t need to drown a dish in spices and/or \u201cheat.\u201d  Except for family favorites I don\u2019t often make the same dish twice. This one will be an exception.",

I looked at several other jambalaya recipes from this site but chose this one because it had the fewest steps....no taking meat out and putting it back in. I used a ginger chicken broth I had leftover from making chicken salad the other day and it added a nice layer to the jambalaya (the ginger was very subtle). I meant to add a bit of chicken base to the broth since it was homemade and unseasoned but I forgot so had to add more salt to the finished product than I would have liked. I will definitely make again using a well seasoned broth next time.",
