Place foil around steak and a piece over top if you don't want bird to touch wood. Foil around base of stake is in case bird gets so done it slides down stake. Place garbage can over turkey mounted on stake with legs down. Light 10 - 12#'s charcoal till turning white. Shoval about 3 briquette's wide around bottom of can with a shoval full on top. Let cook for 1 1/2 hours without removing can. Turkey will be done. No charcoal inside of can. If you wish set a can or 2 of beer inside can with turkey for additional moisture. I found it does't make a difference. Size of turkey is also irrelevant. I've done these in freezing temperatures outside and have always had great results. Bird size doesn't matter. Watch out for the dogs once the stake is in the ground.",
