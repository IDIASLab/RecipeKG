I still soaked them in the water and the added oil added a ton of flavour while keeping the tomatoes very soft. And the recipe says to use half a box of couscous which can be confusing. I buy my couscous from the bulk food store (its WAY cheaper) so I used a ratio of 2 parts liquid to 1 part couscous i.e. used 3/4 a cup of couscous with the 1 1/2 cups of water",
