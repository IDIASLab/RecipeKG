Oddly, the aroma is very close, but the flavor and color is off.  \n\nFirst off, and this comes from someone who loves spicy food, the chili powder seems to be off by six times.  I made it a second time using two teaspoons rather than two tablespoons and it was much better.  I don't know any coney chili that is red.  Every coney I've had has brown chili.  \n\nMiddling complaints aside, this is a good recipe.   It's fairly close to what I could get back at home.  It's certainly hugely better than using a canned chili.  I will use this when I cook coneys, but it certainly isn't like the dogs I had back in metro Detroit.",
