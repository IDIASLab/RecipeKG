The lavender comes through nicely and isn't overpowering; the thyme pairs well with the lavender and strawberries. The strawberries and white balsamic pair nicely and the vinegar adds a good bit of acidity to balance the sweetness from the peak-season strawberries and the caramelized sugar. The thighs have a light amount of smoke and are juicy and tender.",
