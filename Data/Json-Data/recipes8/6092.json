They were perfectly cooked. For the peanut butter I used Jiff Creamy Natural peanut butter. I didn't have Whole Foods brand available. I also assumed quick oats are not as hardy as steel cut, so I halved the peanut butter and maple syrup. I went to do the same with the brown sugar, but it just seemed like it needed more. I added 2 more pinches of brown sugar which may have came to at most 1 tsp. With the extra brown sugar and a quick sprinkle of salt the flavors seemed more balanced. I forgot how quick it is to make a bowl of hot cereal in the microwave. I may make this again as a change to all of the fruit flavored oatmeal recipes. Calories, as made in my notes, came to 1 serving at 118.6 calories. ty, this was very filling this morning with a hot cup of coffee.",

I was intrigued by the peanut butter so I gave this a try. I made this exactly as stated with the only differences being I used rolled oats (not quick cooking) and Jif peanut butter because these are what I had on hand. It was suprisingly good but I'll have to make adjustments for my personal taste to make it great. The dish wasn't as sweet as I thought it was going to be which isn't necessarily a bad thing just not what I was expecting. The peanut butter muted the maple flavor and sweetness. The peanut butter also gave the oatmeal a wonderful creamy consistency which I loved! However it was slightly on the bland side not terribly bland but bland enough that I will have to tweak the recipe. Possibly add raisins cinnamon maybe add more maple syrup or walnuts. It's a good starting point though and gives me ideas for different ways to serve oatmeal. I'm very grateful for that thanks!",
