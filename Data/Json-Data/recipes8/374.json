I only had one cup of banana so added a generous half cup of finely grated zucchini which was conveniently at hand from the morning s zucchini bread marathon. Also I tossed in the half cup or so of chopped walnuts that were left over from the zucchini bread recipe. I made mini muffins no paper liners but a quick spray of Pam. Baked them at 350 for about 9-11 minutes. The recipe made 60 mini muffins and they were delicious!",
