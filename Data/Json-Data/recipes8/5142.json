I am not sure why doing a variation with the Worcestershire instead of the vinegar etc would make it less authentic but this is what we know as Carne Mechada but this one is made with Pork. It should have been a boneless pork roast but you can do the same with Beef. This is a Pork Roast too not to be confused with the so called Pernil Asado. Some people put pepperonis some ham etc. This is why there are recipes. Everyone would make them a bit different. I marinade the meat with oregano olive oil etc and then stuff it.

I remember my uncle more than 35 years ago putting olives and 'salchich\u00f3n' inside of his pork roasts. Salchich\u00f3n is very similar to pepperoni (and he sometimes used mortadella too). He also used olives as well. The worcestershire sauce may seem odd but people have been using it for a while (but we call it salsa inglesa). Anyway this recipe is a twist from the traditional 'criollo' cooking but it is GOOD!",

I Googled their flag and it had similarities to ours and so keeping with the theme of things I used a star cookie cutter on some bread along with some food coloring buttered it and stuck it under the broiler for fun pork sandwiches. I followed this recipe to a T except that I did it in my slow cooker. This was very simple good full of flavor and a nice change to our everyday pork roast. Thanks!",
