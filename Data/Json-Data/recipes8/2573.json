I think adding some warm spices like cinnamon, allspice, clove, and/or black pepper, as well as increasing the nutmeg slightly, would better balance the dish.  The technique of steaming on the stove top produced deliciously tender squash.  I did leave the lid on a skillet and only took it off to reduce the sauce.  I think people who are unhappy with how long it needs to cook either cut their squash too large or did not put the lid on to cook. The cook times were spot on for me.",
