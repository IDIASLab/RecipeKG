BUT I followed the recipe...I thought 3 cups of sugar sounded like a lot but I haven't made brownies from scratch in a while....and now I realize my suspicions were right.  They did not bake right.  Lots to thin and didn't get done.  I left in 15 more minutes but still too thin. I'm taking them from oven hoping as they cool we can do something with a 13' pan of soogy brownies...on ice cream maybe.  I checked other recipes and even half of this would be more than most recipes call for.  I even spread marshmallow on top since my husband was so excited for these and not planning to make the glaze..",
