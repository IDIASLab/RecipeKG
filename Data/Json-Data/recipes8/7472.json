It's a cinch to toss together and goes great with chicken, beef or pork, heck it would even make your sneakers taste good. Recipe can easily be halved to feed a family of four.",

The second time I pre saut\u00e9ed thinly sliced baby bella mushrooms along with the chopped green onions. And my last pass to the two previously added ingredients I crumbled some Ritz crackers saut\u00e9ed those in butter and sprinkled on top of the cheese...and needless to say I get asked to make that every week for dinner in my home of only 4 people and there is never leftovers, they love it do much. I love this recipe because you can do all sorts of things with it. Though I will say it is better to use hidden valley ranch packs then store brand or McCormick's because the others tend to be to salty. (Or just use less)\nMy next adventure is to make a healthier version using reduced fat bacon (lol, right) fat free sour cream, halve olive oil and a pat of butter for the Ritz cracker topping using Reduced fat or lower sodium crackers. And reduced fat cheese. Oh snd oven saut\u00e9ed mushrooms using butter flavored Pam. I wonder if my family will notice the difference!",

There is just the right amount of bacon so that you taste the smokiness in each bite yet it isn't overpowering either. I didn't see the footnotes until after I made this but I agree with the recipe submitter and will use shredded hashbrowns next time. I think ham would also work well in this recipe.

This much fat, carbs, and calories demands a bigger payoff on the palate.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, it's ridiculously easy to make.  Perfect for taking to a potluck.  If I make it again, I will scour the other reviews to see what others did to address that mysterious missing \"something.\"\n\n\nUpdate:  I haven't tried it yet, but it occurred to me that the \"missing\" element here may be the cream of chicken or mushroom soup that is included in other similar recipes.  The mixture seemed too dry going into the over, as was the finished result.  I'll try adding low-sodium (already enough salt here I think) soup next time.  But then we're already talking about a different recipe aren't we?",
