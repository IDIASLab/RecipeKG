Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are slow-cooked in a mixture of citrus juices and seasonings. You can shred the chicken breasts for an ingredient in other dishes, with a little liquid from the cooker, or you can serve the chicken breasts whole, as a main dish, with the yummy sauce. We like these whole, with Cuban Black Beans I, a recipe from the site, and steamed white rice.",
