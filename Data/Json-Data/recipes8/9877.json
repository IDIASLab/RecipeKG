Made 17 1/2 \"cookies\" about 3\" in diameter (baked 9 minutes).  Filled with Kirkland Brand (from CostCo) Vanilla ice cream and then took 1/2 the batch and rolled the ice cream ends in star sprinkles - super fun and tasty!  My husband missed the rectangle shape so next time I am going to try making in a 9 x 13 pan and cutting them.  Thanks Chef John!",
