First off it took 40 minutes to fully bake in the center. After 30 minutes I had to cover the edges since they were starting to be overly golden. Second they were extremely crumbly did not hold together very well. And lastly they just were not tasty rather bland. Sorry but this is a recipe I will not make again.",
