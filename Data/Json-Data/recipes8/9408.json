        "description": "This nostalgic PB&J cake is a whimsical nod to the lunchbox favorite. The \"bread\" of this towering dessert sandwich is a tender white cake baked in square pans and sliced horizontally into four layers. Trimming away the top golden-brown crust of the cake gives it the appearance of white sandwich bread. If you'd prefer, you could use a box cake mix in place of the homemade cake--just be aware that your layers may not be as thick. The peanut butter-cream cheese filling is incredibly easy to mix up, and you can use whatever flavor jam or jelly that you prefer!",
