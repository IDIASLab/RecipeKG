        "description": "This is the real deal! After scouring my all my cookbooks and countless recipes online, I developed a recipe for homemade strawberry cake, no gelatin required! This cake has a wonderful, fresh strawberry taste similar to the flavor combination of strawberry shortcake in a delicate pink layer cake. The color and the flavor are subtle yet delicious. No neon pink here! Just fantastic strawberry flavor. I served this at my daughter's sixth birthday with friends and family and everyone loved it, describing it as 'bakery quality'.",
