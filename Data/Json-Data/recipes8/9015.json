If I were to do this again I would stick with roasting at 350 and glaze more toward the end to get a nice finish. The cooking time in this recipe is also way off. It has you cooking a 10 Turkey for 3 1/2 - 4 hours to an internal temp of 180. A 10 lb turkey will take 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Poultry is considered done at an internal temp of 165.
