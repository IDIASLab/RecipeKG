        "description": "A gorgeous, Italian style heart warming soup made with tomatoes, potatoes, spaghetti and the special secret ingredient....marrow from a marrow bone. Both myself and my brother have been brought up with this delicious soup, and I have made it ever since. Marrow bones are available from your butcher very cheaply, sometimes even for free. If the bone is very large, ask your butcher to cut it in half for you, so it will fit into the pot comfortably. You can use a can of cannellini beans if you prefer. Serve this soup with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.",

I had no prior experience with beef marrow bone and was a little skeptical but it worked out well and added a nice flavor. The recipe doesn't say to remove the bone before serving the soup (or the bay leaves for that matter) but I did - personal preference. I also used dry herbs instead of fresh - might try fresh if I make this again. Overall a nice satisfying soup.",
