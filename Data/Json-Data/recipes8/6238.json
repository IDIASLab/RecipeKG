Never having grilled on a plank before I bought a 1/4 inch piece of maple and soaked it for 6 hrs in water. Either my plank was way too thin or didn't soak it long enough (maybe it was a combination) but after about 5 minutes the entire piece of wood was on fire! I prompty removed the pork chops from the fiery plank and put them on the top rack of the grill where they only 15 more minutes to grill. they were slightly blackened but still excellent. My family's only complaint was that the stuffing might have been a little too miost. Will definately try again with a thicker plank soaked longer and a little less chicken broth in the stufing. Would have been 5 stars if not for the fire!",

I used italian flavoured breadcrumbs rather then croutons and i only had 2 big porkchops so i cut slits in them and stuffed the sauce in there and smeared the remainder on top. I definately think that there is way too much broth in the recipe. i only used about half a cup or so. My toddler liked this too. She said 'delicious!'",
