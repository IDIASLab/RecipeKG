The  on-line version has 1/2 PINCH of white sugar and I later found the magazine version to have 1/2 cup white sugar in the filling.   It definitely needs the 1/2 cup and not \"pinch.\"   \n\nBoth times I made it, it did not firm up despite the gelatin and became more of a very soft pudding.  If I made it again, I would try an extra 1/2 packet so that the cake would be sliceable.   \n\nBrowning the butter for the crust added to the flavor and I will definitely be incorporating browned butter into other crumb style crusts.",
