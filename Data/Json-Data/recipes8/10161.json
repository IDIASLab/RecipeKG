Curing the squash with kosher salt pulls out the bitterness and makes the squash taste sweeter. It's got great texture, taste, and visual appeal and can be served hot, warm, at room temperature or cold for any meal of the day.",

I was in the kitchen prepping, cooking or cleaning something for over an hour.\n\nI had zucchini and Mexican grey squash, so I did make a minor deviation to the recipe.  I did cook the squash longer than called for and it also spent more time under the broiler, so your cooking times may vary as well.\n\nIt was very good and I will make this again.  The flavor and consistency were both excellent.  If the leftovers hold up well I'll probably use this as a cook ahead breakfast for RV trips.",
