An accceptable alternative is to cook 2 cups heavy cream in top of double boiler over simmering water until reduced by half. It will be the consistency of butter, with a crust on top. Pour all, including crust into a bowl, cover and let stand 2 hours. Then, refrigerate 12 hours or more. Stir crust into the cream before serving.",

The first time I followed the instructions to the letter and found it tasty but not as firm as the clotted cream I had in London..  So the second time I made it I seperated the sour cream.  (Dump your sour cream in a strainer lined with cheese cloth or a coffee filter, cover with plastic wrap \u2013 so that it touches the sour cream \u2013 place over a bowl and refrigerate overnight.)\r\n\r\nThis second attempt was perfect.  However when I made it last week a disaster 5 minutes before company came (my whipped cream got coffee grounds dumped on it) forced me to use --- yes you guessed it\u2026. Cool Whip.  I must confess I liked this version the best.  I\u2019m so ashamed and plan to never tell my mother that I used Cool Whip.\r\n",
