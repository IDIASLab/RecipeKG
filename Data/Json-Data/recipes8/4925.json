Subbed Taco Seasoning I from this site rather than using commercially made brands. If feeding people with appetites of sparrows or who are dieting, the portion size will probably be fine. Otherwise, consider whether a \u2018serving size\u2019 of 2 tortillas with minimal filling will be enough unless serving side dishes. The AR photo is misleading as there is no way that is 1/8 of the tortilla filling in each shell (i.e., 1/8 of a medium onion and 3/8 of a mushroom cap). If making again, use at least 4 large mushroom caps (1 per person) and 1 large or 2 medium onions. Fantastic recipe when wanting lighter fare, especially during the hot summer months.",
