So after trying several kinds and spending over $10 a pint at our local farmers' markets, I came up with my own vegan version which costs less and is great to share with family and friends. After fermentation, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 6 months, and will get stronger and spicier as it sits. Mine never lasts that long!",
