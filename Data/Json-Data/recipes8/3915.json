With these adjustments, I did not end up with any wetness in the center; in fact, the loaf turned out just a little dry.  I made a quick simple syrup flavored with the rest of the juice from the lemon and used it to moisten the loaf again as it cooled (I didn't use the powdered sugar glaze, because I was out of powdered sugar).  In the end, the loaf turned out to have a mild rather than a zesty lemon flavor.",

I did not have the problem of the cake being wet in the center, perhaps due to the larger pan and longer cook time. The cake was not light and fluffy but more like a dense pound cake. My only complaint is that I would like for the cake part to have tasted lemony. Perhaps next time I will add some lemon extract to the batter. The glaze really delivers on the lemon taste. I added a little zest on top to pretty it up.",
