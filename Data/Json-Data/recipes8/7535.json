We didn\u2019t have a \u201cplain\u201d cheese sauce so we just doubled the amt of shredded cheese.  SO rich and creamy.  I did however make 2 mistakes.  My chicken was partially thawed so ended up scorching one of the breast.  This led to the machine telling me \u201cburned food\u201d when i got to the pasta \u201ccooking\u201d.  Luckily, it didn\u2019t burn and the 10min it took for the pot to re-pressurize actually cooked the pasta  so it was all good.  Will DEFINITELY try again , the family made it disappear !",

Because I cook for so many (at least 50) I added a bag of Pictsweet peppers and onions and several cans of corn and green beans to make it stretch as far as possible. I couldn't understand why there were so few reviews and then realized it was the method of cooking that many people dont have the appliance mentioned in the recipe. I poached the chicken and then sprinkled the ranch dressing on it and then made the sauce (which included a whole bottle of ranch dressing) and folded the pasta into it. It was simple and very very tasty. I will be making it again for sure.",

Even better as leftovers! - I added it to a casserole dish and warmed it up in the oven on 350 degrees, then added buttered panko breadcrumbs on top for some crunch for the another 10-15 minutes on 450.
