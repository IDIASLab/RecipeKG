Perfect balance of lemon and sugar.. melt in your mouth.  Indeed!  A few discoveries/tips:\nBatter will look too soft/buttery. Trust it. Flour your hands and roll them in sugar as directed. They bake up beautifully.. maybe a bit longer then 10 minutes.\nFrosting is thick. The cookies are just as good without it.  Perfect for a dip in coffee. \nThe frosting as listed is not enough for all 24 cookies. Double the batch.",
