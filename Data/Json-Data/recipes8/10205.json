Made a few changes and one was inadvertent...I had already beaten 3 eggs when I realized this recipe only called for 2.  My oversized zucchini was already very dry, so I didn't salt and rinse it either.   I only had 2 cups of Zucchini once grated, and  I swapped  fresh-picked blueberries for the nuts.  I  also prefer muffins to loaves, so had to adjust baking time.  Other than that,  I  followed his recipe pretty closely.   I liked the unusual addition of ginger and cayenne.   The end result was very tasty, and I will be trying it again with the right number of eggs and",

I would never put cayenne pepper in a sweet quick bread. Also, I had to go back and add 1/2 c of water or so because the batter was too dry from removing the liquid from the zucchini. For meal prepping, esp. when I\u2019m already stressed and pressed for time, this recipe is not ideal. Thank you",
