I halved the recipe because there are just two of us, using the calculator on the site and a 9 x 9\" pan and baking just shy of 25 minutes. I followed the recipe exact, except used pecans instead of almonds because that's what I had. This recipe makes a nice, dense, blondie that isn't too sweet (I was worried it might be). The raspberry jam is a nice touch. Would make these again.",

The blondies have a nice browned butter taste but that doesn\u2019t pair well with the sweet, tart jam or the salty, crunchy almonds. The cook time and temperature did not work for my oven. The blondies were underdone in the middle and overdone on the outer edge. I would recommend cooking at a lower temperature for a longer time to compensate. The batter smells delicious and the prep was so easy. I\u2019m sure some tweaks could fix this recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "While I was a little hesitant about melting ALL of the white chocolate instead of keeping some for chunks throughout, the recipe yielded a super chewy blondie with excellent notes of caramelization. My biggest issue was that the cook time took more than 2x what was stated to get a clean toothpick, and as a result, some of the edges got burnt. That said, the edges that were *just* on the cusp of burning were my favorite parts and made me wish for a special all-edge pieces brownie pan! Also, I didn't have straight-up raspberry preserves on hand so I used Bonne Mamman's Four Fruit preserves (and more than doubled what was called for in the recipe to make sure I got some in every bite). Overall, I'd make this recipe again, albeit with some technical tweaks.",
