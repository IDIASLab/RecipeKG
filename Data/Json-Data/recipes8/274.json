I also doubled it to take to a family outing.  When modified & doubled I used 2C milk and 3-1/6C heavy cream.  I used a good dark chocolate bar (Valrhona, 70% Guana dark choc. - Whole Foods).  I let it cool overnight and it came out almost like thick chocolate mousse.  I used our old fashioned ice cream maker and it only took about 20-30 minutes and thicked a bit more.   I also added mini white choc. chips when I put the mixture to the maker.  Think next time I might try mini semi or dark choc. chips instead.  I didn't prefer the white choc. flavor, but hubby did.  I also may try a little cinnamon or espresso powder with the dry cocoa powder. It made about 1/2 gallon or 8 cups. It was delicious and rich. Not too sweet or strong for us.  Definately will make again!!!",

While this is a stunningly delightful dessert, it is too rich - if that is even possible! I served my wife and I portions of about 3/4 cup size, and we could only eat half of that because it was so rich - like eating fudge.  Although really, really good, I probably would not make this with as much cream next time!",
