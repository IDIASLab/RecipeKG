I added a box of dry instant lemon pudding for more body, then took lemon sandwich cookies, put them through my food processor to fine crumbs (where DOES that filling go??) then took 1 1/2 (or more) cups of the crumbs with about 5 TLB (or more) melted butter and made my crust out of that.  Then took a couple spoonfuls cookie crumbs and sprinkled on top.  AWESOME!!  (And I don't even like lemon pie). To be even more different, take 4 oz. softened cream cheese mixed well with 1/2 confectioner's sugar and spread this in the bottom of your chilled crust before putting in the lemon mixture.",

It's also SO easy and quick that we tend to make it just to cure a sweet tooth! To make it virtually fat free is simple. Use fat free Eagle Brand milk and fat free cool whip! Don't worry about the taste of the fat free Eagle Brand--it's DELISH! The consistency is a little bit thinner than regular EB but when the pie's chilled you can't tell a bit of difference! We always have trouble finding the 6 oz can of lemonade too. So we use a 12 oz and just make ourselves \"suffer\" through two pies;) The filling of this pie is so good that we've often joked of just whipping it up and eating it as a pudding. Hey a few crumbled graham crackers and I think it'd be a hit!",

My guests absolutely raved about it. I used purchased graham cracker crusts and had lots of filling to mound up.  I did not freeze it as others suggested and the texture was wonderful.  Not runny at all. One thing I did was to mix the condensed milk and lemonade thoroughly before adding the whipped topping. I will definitely make it again and would like to try lime concentrate next time.",

Instead of a graham cracker crust I usually make it with a homemade one consisting of 60 Ritz crackers crushed 1/2 cup butter melted 3/4 cup powdered sugar combined and sprinkled in the bottom of a 9-inch square pan. It isn't firm like a graham cracker crust but the salty/sweet combination is good with the tart/sweet filling.",

I agree with other reviewers that it tastes the best and has a better consistency if it is kept in the freezer. Also like others have mentioned a gingersnap crust works great with this pie. For those who think the concentrate makes it too sweet add some fresh squeezed lemon juice to subtitute for some of the concentrate for a tangier lemon taste. After slicing serve with fresh strawberries and blueberries--great for 4th of July!",
