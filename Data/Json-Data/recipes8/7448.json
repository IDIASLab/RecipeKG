I really liked that this was a healthier version of the traditional German Potato Salad with out cutting out all the flavor (I used real bacon bits in place of fresh cooked bacon to cut down on the fat). After mixing I seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
