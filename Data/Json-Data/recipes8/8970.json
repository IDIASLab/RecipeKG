I'd never cooked with chestnuts before (half of the bag I bought had spoiled unfortunately so the stuffing wasn't all that chestnutty); they were a seriously yummy addition to stuffing but time consuming to prepare. I added apples and used fresh herbs instead of dried which I think is crucial to the flavor and appearance. I baked the leftover stuffing that didn't make it into the turkey and it was a bit buttery--next time I might cut down on the butter and substitute some broth. We had an extra two guests for dinner last night and now there is just not enough leftovers! I might make another batch of this stuffing--it's seriously good.",

I used to criss cross the chestnut too and that is a task I did for many years & hated it. My fingers were so sore and took over an hour to peel 2-3 lbs. About 4 yrs ago I decided to take a hammer to them. I hit each w/a hammer until they are split then put them in the water for about 30 minutes until they are soft inside. You can also put them in the oven after they have been hit to save the vitamins. Then run them under cold water if I want to use them right away or wait until they cool. I also use ground beef and cook the giblets and grind them up and add them along w/onions garlic salt/pepper oregano and bags of bread stuffing. I used to fry all of this for years but now I put the stuffing in the oven and cover w/tin foil and bake for about 45 minutes (depending on the amount). Much easier and just as tasty. This can be done a day in advance. Stuff the bird as usual on Tday. Have a great Thanksgiving everyone!!!",
