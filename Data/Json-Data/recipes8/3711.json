I definately recommend this recipe to anyone who loves a strawberry shortcake.",

It is a wonderful recipe but you do have to understand that the cake is a shortcake not a typical American butter cake. It is not very moist and has only a slight chocolate flavor that really allows the strawberries to shine. I only serve this cake with real whipped cream (flavored with a bit of vanilla) and a homemade chocolate sauce. The chocolate sauce soaks into the cake and the whipped cream compensates for the less sweet cake. All together it is amazing!",
