I did not put cheese on the bottom of the baking dish just meat sauce. After spreading the cream cheese and sauce on the noodle (I didn't measure it made 10 rolls and used almost 1-1/2 blocks of cream cheese) I sprinkled it w/ parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese before rolling. After filling the pan w/ the rolls I topped them w/ the rest of the sauce and more parmesan and mozzarella cheese. These were very tasty and I really liked the richness that the cream cheese added. My ricotta-hating hubby loved these. I will be making these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
