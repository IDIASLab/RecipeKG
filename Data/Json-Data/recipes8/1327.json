The blueberries pop in your mouth there s just a hint of lemon and this had just the right amount of sweetness for us (basically not too much sugar). Using a 1/4 cup measure I ended up with 8 good-sized pancakes (so two per person). I've made a lot of pancakes and this batter texture was spot on. Very tasty recipe and I d make again.",
