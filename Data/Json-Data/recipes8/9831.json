The title should absolutely reflect it as a Hot / Spicy Classic Southern Fried Chicken. As a retired Award Winning Chef this is a very important note that\u2019s been omitted from the title. When one is making a title you have to think of it as what would you call it in a restaurant. If someone were to order this in a restaurant and not be aware of the hot sauce and Cayenne Pepper involvement\u2026. I\u2019d say a manger will be summoned to the table. Besides that, I made this recipe and it turned out very very well. It was very crispy and very tender. For those who havGood luck when submitting future recipes, this was a gooder beyond the title.",
