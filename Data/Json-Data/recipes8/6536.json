                "reviewBody": "I understand that the idea here is to get smoked wings without the wait but by baking them at 350 for an hour first you lose most all of the fat that has rendered from the skin which is important when smoking. Without it you end up with a very tough piece of meat and not near as much smoke flavor either. I made half of the wings as directed and half my way which was thawed and directly on the smoker. Sure enough, as written they were way too tough and very little smoke flavor. If you plan ahead and thaw your wings (better yet buy fresh), you can still have wings in 2 hours. You'll just need to bump the temp up on the smoker to 250.     Another thing to note is that these needed more salt than what the recipe called for.",
