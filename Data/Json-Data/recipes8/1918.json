Cake was dry (considering it had both bananas and sour cream) and didn't have a strong banana flavor. Tasted like weak banana bread with a caramel icing. I didn't have any trouble with the icing. Made as directed and let it cool a little bit until it thickened up. Had enough to ice two cakes, but I used it all. It hardens up and becomes quite thick. The icing was really the only saving grace that made it three stars for me.",
