I replaced the 1 tsp of red pepper flakes with 1 tsp of Sambal Oelek, and that provided a nice level of heat for us. My one issue is that boiling the sauce down until thickened is delicious, but it doesn't make for much sauce at all. So if I were to do this again, I'd either double the sauce amount, or simply use cornstarch to thicken it. Overall, a nice recipe though. Thank you!",

I would grate the Ginger instead of chopping it. The Ginger and red pepper flakes were in the bottom of the skillet and didn\u2019t combine well. I served on basmati rice with a side of asparagus.
