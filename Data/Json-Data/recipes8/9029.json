Start the smoker, ( Good thing I wasn't Appling as a contestant on Survivor!! LOLOL ) LOSER!  & 2. keeping the proper temperature going. I had my spray bottle of water, which helped even more then closing the dampers, they only did so much but still too hot. My 13 lb. brined turkey took less then 2 hours. Too hot, I get it:) It was very good! I did give hubby a piece before we ate dinner and he thought it was ham. It was a Smokey Thanksgiving as I also served Ham! hahaha. Thank You Tom T. had fun with this one!",
