And I DID use the full 2 cups of cream, which was just perfect.  Having said that, I believe this is a good, 3-star recipe, which in my book means average--not bad, but not extraordinarily good either. This was surprisingly nondescript, both in color and flavor.  Some might describe it as bland, hubby said it \"needed something.\"\nEven using the entire can of green chilies would have given this a flavor punch, and you might want to kick it up with maybe cumin, jalapeno, or hot sauce. Nevertheless, this made for an enjoyable dinner.",

I added 4oz cream cheese nuked it to make it soft then added the cream salt and pepper. I also added spinach to the chicken mixture. Next time I will add additional veggies to the chicken mixture - this is a ton of calories so I need to disguise some veggies for my family! Maybe some corn bell pepper and tomatoes. I used regular salsa (Kroger Premium Selection Restaurant Style - my FAVE!) and 2 4oz cans of green chiles and used a rotisserie chicken bought at the grocery store cut up. (I was not about to cook chicken when I had worked all day!) I used flour tortillas because I don't care for corn and didn't fry them - I loved the texture of the flour tortillas it was soft but where the cheese melted was crispy and bubbly! I also used 8oz of Jack cheese who needs a little bit left over it goes bad!;) Overall this is fabulous definitely the best enchiladas I've had! Thank you for sharing it will definitely be used again!",

Don't get me wrong the dish was good but next time I'll add granulated garlic and maybe some onion powder. I'll definitely use FRESH long green chile. I might garnish with fresh chopped cilantro. To roast chilies at home: Place chilies on a hot grill or in your ovens broiler. Be sure to rotate the chilies to allow the skin to blacken and blister all around. Place chilies in a large zip lock then wrap the bag of chilies in a clean kitchen towel(the steam will loosen the skin). After the chilies have cooled to room temp peel the skin off and discard (the skin). Cut chilies into long strips or dice them up. You can freeze any unused chilies for future use.",

I used some leftover veggie flavor cream cheese (melted) and replaced 1 cup of cream with 1 cup of sour cream. I reduced the amount of green chili by half and added a whole chopped green pepper and also added a shredded carrot. After placing remaining cream on top of the enchiladas and before covering with cheese I added a few tablespoons of chopped cilantro leaves. My family loved this; the only thing they would have liked was a bit of salsa verde sprinkled on top when served. I will try that next time (and there will be a next time).",
