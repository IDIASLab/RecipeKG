A size should be given, preferably a 10\u201d or 12\u201d one.\n\nI made mine in a 12\u201d skillet and thought that the brown sugar should be cut in half, I didn\u2019t use the entire cup and a half. However this amount did help the cake to come out as there was lots of brown sugar still in the pan as well as plenty on the cake.\n\nI to found the cook time to be to short, I added 15 minutes and I did use paper towels to drain the pineapple rings as another recipe suggested.\n\nI made this cake for my father as it is his favorite and he was very happy with the results, so it was a successful cake.",
