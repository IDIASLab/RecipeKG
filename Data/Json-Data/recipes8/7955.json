The one thing that makes this recipe different from others I've made is that it uses vegetable soup mix rather than Italian or ranch dressing. One change I made was only using one 8 oz. cream cheese. One was creamy enough and covered the entire cookie sheet as I wanted the fresh veggies to shine through not the cheese mixture. I topped it with: fresh spinach red yellow orange & green peppers red onion radishes cauliflower broccoli carrots diced tomatoes and a little shredded cheese. I took this to a beer tasting party and it was well received.",
