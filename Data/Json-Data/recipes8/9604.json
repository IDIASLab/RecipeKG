        "description": "These intensely rich brownie bars are not for the faint of appetite. Each brownie bears a fruity layer of raspberry jam and fresh raspberries that's covered with a truffle-like blanket of chocolate ganache over top. In other words, they're decadence incarnate. If raspberries aren't your favorite, you can always substitute strawberry jam and fresh strawberries--but you'll want to slice them in half rather than leaving them whole. If desired, garnish with a drizzle of melted white chocolate.",
