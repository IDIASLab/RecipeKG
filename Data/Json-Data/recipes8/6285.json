One thing to add is finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese stuffed right on top of the cream cheese and before you wrap in the bacon.  ALTERNATE COOKING METHOD:  Bake at 350 for about 25-30 minutes until the bacon is nearly done then broil them for about 5 minutes to crisp up the bacon.  WATCH them when they are broiling so they don't burn.  If you just broil them, I find the bacon comes out charred in some places and fatty and limp in others, and you don't have to flip them with this method.  Also, cook on a rack with a cookie sheet so they are not sitting in the rendered fat of the bacon.....I've done these 30+ times and expierimented with the cooking method.",

After reading reviews I pulled it off like this: \nDid all the recommended prep plus baked the jalapenos for 15 minutes at 350 to lessen the heat. Let them cool a couple of minutes so I could handle them and filled them with a mixture of 1/2 tub of whipped cream cheese, 1/4 cup or so of cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup parmesean cheese, and 1 teaspoon seasoning (Costco no salt seasoning). Took the 1/2 slice of bacon, wrapped it around and put them cheese side up in the 350 oven. Change it to low broil and kept an eye on them for 5-10 minutes until the cheese started to brown and the bacon was lightly crisped. Heaven, heaven, heaven!!! There was a little crunch in the jalapeno which was nice so you got a couple of good bites without dragging the filling all out. Enough heat in the jalapeno to be flavorful and not burn your tongue off so you can't taste the next one. Delish! Will certainly do this again and again and again!",
