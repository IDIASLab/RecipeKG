You might think \"that sounds great, but they must taste terrible like all 'healthy' donuts,\" but that's the thing--they don't! They taste really good, especially if they're covered in chocolate. These donuts may be topped with melted dark chocolate and garnished with toasted coconut, chopped almonds, or dark chocolate chips if desired.",

                "reviewBody": "I was excited to see Chef John do a low-carb donut and I promptly made these over the weekend. I've been trying to follow a (somewhat) keto diet since the beginning of the year, so I did tweak this recipe by substituting the maple syrup with 1/4 cup of allulose. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum to help with binding. Although not included in the recipe above, Chef John did add melted chocolate and toppings to his donuts and I used melted Lily's sugar free chocolate chips and unsweetened coconut for my toppings. The results were GREAT! I will say the dough was extremely sticky to work with and I was only able to get 5 donuts out of the recipe vs. 6, likely due to overfilling the donut tins and not being able to get every bit of the dough out of the piping bag. Donuts still tasted great 3 days after baking. Will definitely make again. Thanks!",
