The recipe yielded about 18 by using the scoop. After I scooped them onto the parchment lined baking sheets, I turned the scoop over and made a little well for the berries to sit in.\nI also sliced my strawberries because they were HUGE and leaving them whole wasn't an option.\nOther than that I made as is. Delicious and perfect for summer time. My kids were surprised and excited to discover the marshmallow texture inside. I highly recommend this recipe, so simple and pretty. Would be great for a luncheon or entertaining.",

Be sure to wait a full hour for this to cool - I got anxious and rushed this part; I think my Pavlova would have been a tad taller had I waited the full cooling time.  The cream also ended up melting some and so berries weren't stable...  Also, if you watch the video, beating the whites by hand is noble but unless you want to spend about 45 minutes doing it, use a mixer!!!!",
