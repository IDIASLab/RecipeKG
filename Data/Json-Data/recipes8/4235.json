These were gobbled up in no time. I did think they  could use some crunch so I served sliced cucumber on the side. Next time I'll just add them right on the sandwich. The only change I made is that I used rye and pumpernickel swirl bread from Pepperidgefarm because that is all the rage around here these days. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!",
