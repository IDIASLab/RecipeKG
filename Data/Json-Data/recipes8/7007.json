I'd suggest ditching the cooking spray and using peanut or vegetable oil. You'll get a much better, authentic flavor and it's much easier to cook with. I used a wok, but any large pan would work. You'll get the best results by cooking the rice and egg over high heat. I also suggest using dark soy sauce to get that authentic flavor. I garnished with some green onion. I'll be making this every time I get stuck with leftover turkey!",
