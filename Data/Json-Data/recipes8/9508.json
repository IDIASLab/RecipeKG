While I can't promise authenticity, I can promise this is fast and simple to make--and I think, extremely delicious.",

Subtle flavors play and come together beautifully; sweet savory notes from the spinach + sesame dressing, meaty + tangy from the sushi-grade tuna + ponzu, rounded out by a creamy, tangy miso mayo aioli to balance the leanness of the dish with a bit of fat. \n\nI added koshihikari rice to the meal to make it a bit more filling, but otherwise I wouldn't change anything about this meal. Definitely spring for a block of sashimi-grade tuna if you can find it, there are so few ingredients and the preparation is so uncomplicated that you won't be able to mask lesser-quality fish.",
