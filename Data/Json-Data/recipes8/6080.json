The recipe submitter was correct in stating that even 1 minute difference in bake time means that the cookies will be dry vs moist. It takes a little bit of trial and error, depending on exactly the size of your cookies to get the baking time right. The frosting worked great too. There was enough to completely cover the cookies, and it was nice and chocolaty. It set up perfectly. I would definitely make these again, as I found them to be very delicious, and everyone at work ate them up in 15 minutes.",

We found the cinnamon to be overpowering and the cookies (despite taking them from the oven when they seemed almost undercooked) really dry. I think what works about Texas sheet cake is that the frosting really sit in the pan and soaks into the cake. That doesn't happen he same way with the cookies. We put lots of frosting on top but some of it slid down the sides and was wasted so instead of a cookie saturated with the yummy frosting we got a dry cookie with a layer of frosting on top. We won't be making the again, we'll stick with the cakes.",

I felt it was just too sweet despite adding the salt that the recipe calls for. They were moist and crumbly, but the problem was definitely the \"ganache\". Now, be careful with the amount of extra cream you use to soften it. If you need to add more cream, my recommendation would be to add by tsp. I will see if I can make this with less sugar. The cookie itself to me is perfectly sweet don't add more sugar to the batter. Will make it again but will change the \"ganache\"!",
