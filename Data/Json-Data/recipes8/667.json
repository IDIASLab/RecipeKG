I mixed up all the dry ingredients, including the sugar, then realized that the sugar was supposed to be creamed with the butter. So I creamed everything else: butter, eggs, lemon zest, lemon and vanilla extracts, ricotta, lemon juice, then added the dry ingreds. It worked out just fine, but next time I'll follow the recipe as written. This is definitely the best cake I've ever baked. Easy to make. Moist! And the glaze just made it scrumptious.
