It's creamy coconut-y and so easy to make! I only made 3 servings of the recipe to allow for only using 1 can of light coconut milk (which gave me about 1 3/4 cups of liquid) and made up the extra 1/4 cup needed with unsweetened almond milk. I also added a pinch of salt but other than that--kept it as-is. The cook time was perfect. Just make sure you stir the rice quite frequently or it will stick to the bottom of the pan. It was also exceptional when served with some toasted coconut and almonds on top. I will most definitely be making this again---thank you for the recipe!",
