Removed meat and shredded it, poured the seasoned soup mix into a bowl and stirred in the salsa, cheese, 1/2 C sour cream, and fresh cilantro. Stirred meat back into this mixture and started the layers. I sprinkled sliced olives on top of every layer. Cooked on high until the top layer of cheese looked melted (about 75 minutes). I kept my tortillas in the fridge all day, and that may have kept them from crumbling into mush while they cooked. All my husband and I could say while eating this was \"oh my god this is good!\", and we had to force ourselves NOT to eat the whole thing in one night. Reheated portions the next day (microwave for lunch, and oven for dinner), and it was even tastier!\n\n[ETA]: I have made this several times for potlucks at work, using the ground beef and doubling the amounts. I prep it the night before and put my 6 quart crock in the fridge, then heat it the next day at work. If you sprinkle cheese on top of every salsa/soup layer, and use a DOUBLE-thick layer of corn tortilla wedges, the tortillas do not get very mushy, even after sitting in the fridge overnight.",

GEE, THANKS!!! \n\nSeeing that I didn't have much time to prepare, I found this recipe and figured it would be quick and simple to make. I'm so glad I found it!!\n\nI did make a few minor changes: I saw that quite a few people had noted that theirs had turned out \"goopy\" so I used 2 lbs of meat and also mixed in a can of drained black beans to give it some added substance. I reduced the water down to 3/4 cup and also cut the cheese in half (only used 2 cups). I used 1 and a 1/2 cups for the soup mixture and left the remaining 1/2 cup for the top. It was AWESOME!!!! It smelt, tasted and also presented itself very nicely!!! \n\nI was a little skeptical because I like to try out my recipes beforehand but this turned out to be a huge hit. There were no leftovers (which was a downfall for my family!!!) and I had to send out a mass email with the recipe because everyone kept coming by my office asking for it. \n\nThanks so much for such a great recipe!!!! This is definately a keeper =)",

Substitute regular soup w/ healthy choice low sodium (you could definitely  get away with one can!) since this dish is salty enough.  I used 12 corn tortillas, but I could suggest using more...even doubling the layers if you're a big tortilla fan b/c they seem to get lost in the mix.  Definitely don't need 4 cups of cheese (I used between 2 and 3).  I put a layer of refried black beans...one can...next time I will use 2 or 3 cans.  I also baked this in a casserole dish at 350 for 40 min.  Didn't see the point of using my slow cooker...unless you're planning to leave and then come back.  My husband suggested using crunchy tortillas next time or even layering some Fritos corn chips!  I will try that next time.  The only thing I was disappointed in was that this dish turned out more like a dip than an enchilada casserole.  Oh-and did I mention my 2 year old asked for seconds? :D   ",

Never imagined that the soups would leave this dish tasting Mexicany but they are subtle and let the other flavors shine. I like trying new recipes as is the first time but didn t have enough salsa or cheese on hand so substituted Mexican style tomatoes with green chilies (Rotel) and substituted a mixture of cheddar pepper jack and cream cheese. Next time I will add green onions for color plus I like them and double the amount of corn tortillas I like them too. The only problem I had was that I cooked it for 2 hours and still had to zap it a little to finish melting the cheese perhaps my crock pot cooks at a lower temperature than yours.",

But when served over a bed of fresh shredded lettuce and tomatoes then covered with my favorite brand of taco sauce it went from 2-stars to 4-stars! The black olives on top were a big help too. Next time I'll probably use a mixture of pepper jack and habanero cheddar cheeses to add some spice to it. I'll probably also add in another 50% ground beef as there wasn't much to go around and I'll use about half as much water in the meat. Worth trying for sure though!",

Third, I substituted the cream of mushroom soup for Santa Fe cooking creme (to add creaminess and spice!) and used chunky black bean and roasted corn salsa. Since I used a 6quart crockpot I didn't quarter the tortillas, I left them whole and placed them 3 across. I cooked these on low for 3 hours, and the last half hour with the lid off to evaporate some of the moisture and brown the top. Delicious! I will definitely make them again!",
