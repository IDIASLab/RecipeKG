I served it with a garbanzo bean salad I threw together with diced red onion, quartered cherry tomatoes, salt, pepper, red wine vinegar and oil, and some fresh parsley. My picky roommate loved it!",

In my opinion corn tortillas need to be lightly toasted to bring out their full flavor potential, however doing so makes them crispy and next to impossible to roll... Solution? Dip them in the enchilada sauce= instant rollability. :)  So just use a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and let them get slightly golden (takes like 5 seconds). Dip and ready for rolling. \nI used hot enchilada sauce which was delicious!!!  These are on our menu often from now on.\nI should have mentioned above... these made more than 12 enchiladas, I got 24 out of the amount of filling with 4 sweet potatos.",
