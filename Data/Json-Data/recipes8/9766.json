        "description": "This recipe was contributed to Allrecipes by TV host, author, and recipe developer Chadwick Boyd: Every spring, I go ramp hunting deep in the North Carolina mountains with my buddy Allan. The wild onions love to grow in large patches especially in ravines and around the base of shaded trees. They are more mellow in flavor than scallions, making them wonderful substitutes in scrambled eggs, salads, and pasta. Since their season is so short, between April and early May, I like to make a special version of my sausage gravy to serve with my tall, buttery, Greek yogurt biscuits. Serve spooned over freshly baked biscuits.",
