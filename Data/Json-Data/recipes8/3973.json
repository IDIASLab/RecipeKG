I used the zest of 2 lemons in this, but otherwise kept everything else the same. It took 25 minutes in ice cream maker to set up (but that's just how long my ice cream maker takes). Next time I make it, I might try 3/4 cup limoncello instead of a 1/2. The flavor of the limoncello is there, but it's a bit light, so I might try upping it slightly in the future. But still, the recipe as-is, is completely and utterly delicious! 10 stars! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!!",
