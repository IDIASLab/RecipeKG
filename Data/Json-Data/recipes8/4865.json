I stayed true to the recipe only adding sliced red pepper and some red onion rings to the vegetable medley. For preparation when the vegetables are close to being finished it is easier to put the mushroom bottom side down on the bun top with the veggies and then top with the blue cheese. I then put the sandwiches under a high broiler until the cheese browned a bit. I then topped the sandwiches with the top of the bun. Delicious and healthy idea!",

The portabella was nice and tender while the rest of the veggies added a nice crunch. I put the mushroom cap face-up on the bottom then added the blue cheese crumbles to that (they stay in the burger a little easier that way) and then piled the rest on top. I also used about 3/4 of a bottle of lite balsamic vinaigrette which cuts down on the calories and you can't taste the difference. Delicious healthy and very easy!",

I used homemade balsamic vinaigrette and I didn't have time to marinate but they still had plenty of flavor. Also since it's too cold to grill I roasted the veggies in the oven at 425. Because my buns were way too small for the huge portobellos I had I used sprouted-grain bagels which aren't as dense as regular bagels but are thicker than buns and held up well to the juicy veggies. I'm making again this week--and this time I'll remember the blue cheese!",
