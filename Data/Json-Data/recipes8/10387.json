        "description": "Instead of frying, these breaded chicken thighs are baked in the oven. Chicken thighs are more juicy than chicken breasts, and more forgiving, if they stay in the oven a minute too long. It's always best to rely on a meat thermometer, though. Nearly any vegetable or salad will work as a side. I pulled out some leftovers and hardly anyone noticed because of the tasty chicken.",
