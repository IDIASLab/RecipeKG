I used 1 lb of boneless cubed goat meat and made this in an electric pressure cooker - first cooking the meat spices onions and tomato for about 15 minutes then adding the remaining ingredients and pressure cooking for an additional 8 minutes. I wanted to stretch this recipe for my family so I added frozen peas and 2 cubed medium potatoes with the squash during the 2nd time in the pressure cooker. Served over rice with a dollop of sour cream on top.",
