This was super simple recipe but delicious outcomes. As chef John says on YouTube, really only need a teaspoon of the onion, I didn\u2019t heed his advice and had some blowouts. Also would suggest really trying to make a large opening in center and flattening them out as they will rise. They were delicious after resting out of the oven and warm and were awesome the next day in a egg sandwich. Also be sure to brush with water evenly to get crispness and less flour chalky patches.",
