The hint of allspice and slight tang from vinegar create a perfect balance in this dish. They remind me of eating at a Lebanese food festival, although not quite as spicy. Serve with Greek salad or tabouli salad and warm pita for the perfect bite!",

The only thing I did differently was put the whole head of cabbage in the freezer several days ago, defrosted it, cut the core out, and the leaves just fall off.  They\u2019ll be wet, but I just drain them, and wipe each leaf with a paper towel.  This is a method I found in a cookbook called The Cabbage King, and I\u2019ve been doing it this way for years (just easier).  Cooked 6 rolls last night, and put the other half in the freezer. (uncooked) for a quick weeknight meal.  I know oven temperatures can vary and mine be running a bit hot, but the filling overcooked on the rolls.  In the future, I\u2019ll start checking for doneness at 45 minutes.  I\u2019ll probably add a few red pepper flakes to the sauce next time, but that\u2019s personal taste.  Stuffed cabbage rolls are a bit of work, but they\u2019re worth the effort.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  This one\u2019s a keeper.",
