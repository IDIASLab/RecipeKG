To make clean-up easier, I sprayed the dish with PAM, used 1 small can of green chilies instead of a jalape\u00f1o while browning meat, 1 c. of sour cream instead of yogurt (I didn\u2019t have any yogurt in the fridge) and 1 can of enchilada sauce. I dipped each WHEAT tortilla into the sauce before filling. I also poured remaining sauce over enchiladas before I baked. WONDERFUL! This tastes better than a local caterer's recipe. Well done. Also, made these again and topped with fresh chopped cilantro and black olives when the dish came out of the oven. Yum!",

I used sour cream instead of yogurt, and jack instead of mozzarella cheese, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I found that 1 1/2 lbs. of meat was a bit too much to fill the tortillas and still be able to roll them up, so I just sprinkled the extra meat on top.  But probably 1 lb. of meat would be ample for the recipe.  Also, heating the tortillas, covered, in the microwave, to soften them a bit would make them easier to roll up without without cracking.\r\n\r\n",

To be fair to the submitter, I always follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it, but my family thought these were bland.  I usually make chicken or seafood enchiladas with a green or red sauce and I thought the ground beef would be a nice change.  The soup, yogurt, and mozzarella sauce was interesting, but there was too much of it and the ground beef filling for only 6 corn tortillas.  Also, the taco seasoning didn't seem quite right and perhaps the recipe would have been better if I had used my own seasoning combo instead of the taco seasoning mix and had used monterey jack cheese instead of the mozzarella.  I won't make these again.",
