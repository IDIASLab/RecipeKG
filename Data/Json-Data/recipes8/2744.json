In place of the Worcestershire sauce, which I really only like on beef, I used some cumin, corriander, chili powder, crushed red pepper, sea salt, and fresh black pepper.  I also used fresh lemonade, (real lemons juice, simple syrup and water) and a lot of lime juice.  I marinated the chicken in the lemon/lime juice for an hour, and I also simmered it until there was very little liquid left, like others have mentioned.  My family really enjoyed it.  Although I made some changes, the recipe was a great starting out point.  Thanks!",

I prefer the canned chicken in mexican food because it breaks apart easier.  I added a small chopped yellow onion to the marinade.  I used hard taco shells instead of tortillas but next time i will use tortillas.  I also cooked the marinade until all of the fluids had cooked off.  In the future I think I won't use an entire head of lettuce as I had way too much leftover.  Great recipe Tara.",

The chicken itself was flavorful, but in the tacos it didn't stand out as much due to the other fillings. This recipe is tasty, but needs a little  kick to make it stand out more. I didn't use the bay leaves & added more lime juice. To cut out fat, I'll only use 1 tbsp. oil next time. I will also try a more intense, tart lemonade to make the flavor pop. Lastly, I think de-glazing the chicken in the pan would give a more tasty texture.",
