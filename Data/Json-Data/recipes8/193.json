                "reviewBody": "Flavor and texture-wise these scones were quite enjoyable. I don't know that I'd really call them 'spicy' as the spices weren't super predominate, but that's neither here nor there. I did find these to be super, super sticky and difficult to work with. Even with flouring my work surface, my hands, the knife I cut them with, and a spatula, these scones stuck to everything. Trying to move them and have them keep any sort of shape was almost impossible. I had to spend a lot of time reshaping them once they were on the baking sheet. I think it might be easier to simply pat the dough into an 8 or 9 inch circle on floured parchment paper, cut the dough into 8-10 triangles, and then move them slightly apart on the parchment before placing that onto a baking sheet. Doing it the other way was a pain; so maybe simplifying that part of process would reduce some of the headache of transferring these. Nevertheless, these produced a nice light scone (maybe not quite as flaky as regular scones, but that could be due to how much I had to handle them), with a good pumpkin flavor, and a hint of spice.  I think to make it spicier, the addition of nutmeg, cloves, and allspice would be great as well. Thanks for the recipe!",
