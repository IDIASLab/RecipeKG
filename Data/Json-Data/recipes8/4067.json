And not chocolate flavoured crumbles to wear on your shirt instead of making it to your mouth! (and I didn't use the xanthan gum) If you're a nut for dark chocolate, then you will be in heaven when you eat these. I made a half recipe and got 12 regular-sized muffins using slightly less than 1/4 cup of batter per cupcake. I used a chopped piece of 70% cacao, didn't have any chips on hand. Reading the notes, I did use brown rice flour instead of coconut and used regular whole, milk instead of buttermilk. The cupcakes  cooked exactly as stated, in 20 minutes. Really a great treat for gluten free diets or not. Thank you, gem bee, for the recipe.",

The only changes I made were sifting all the dry ingredients prior to mixing with the wet.  I beat the wet ingredients well before combining.  I folded in the chocolate chips at the end.  I added a heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise to the wet ingredients (I always add mayo to GF baking for moisture and mouth feel).  I sprinkled white sugar on the tops at about 15 minutes of baking time.  We don't frost cupcakes because our treats can end up in backpacks, bike packs or car trips.   I had to increase baking time by 5 minutes.  This will be my new \"go to\" recipe for all cakes, cupcakes and muffins (with slight ingredient changes ).  Thank you for this recipe!",

I subbed applesauce for half the oil content and used olive oil for the rest. I don\u2019t keep buttermilk on hand, so I used the milk and vinegar trick. I also threw in a little instant coffee for a bit of a mocha flavor, but it didn\u2019t really come through. I guess next time I might try it again and add more coffee. But I think they\u2019re amazing as is! The texture was spot-on! I have celiac disease, and if I were to buy one of these I would\u2019ve probably taken one bite and become extremely nervous, because it\u2019s quite hard to believe it doesn\u2019t have gluten in it.
