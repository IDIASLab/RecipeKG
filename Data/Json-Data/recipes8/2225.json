I did make a few alterations using seedless watermelons was MUCH easier. The syrup seemed awful thin so I doubled the suger but not the water and it adhered to the fruit much better. It seemed like a TON of filling for the watermelons but when I finished all the preperations it all fit just perfectly. I saved the top part of the watermelon and put it back on using wooden shish-k-bob sticks to hold it closed till we arrived at the park. Great recipe thanks!!",
