UPDATE 3/3/2017: Not sure why I rated 5 stars because without additional seasoning this recipe is bland for us. In 2012 I used 1 tbsp Tony Chachere's Original Creole seasoning (loads of salt and MSG in it). This time I used 1 tbsp Creole Seasoning Blend (from this site) and felt more seasoning was needed...about 1/2 tbsp more of this particular blend for three 1.5\" chops. Without addition of any creole or cajun seasoning the recipe gets 2 stars; with the additional seasoning I'd give it 5 stars (replace the seasoning salt with a creole/cajun blend).",
