We loved this dish! I used Serrano chilies and Queso Fresco as substitutes. Other than that, it was made exactly according to the directions. I used a large frying pan so the egg mixture would be thin, since you're not supposed to flip or mix the mixture. I also covered the pan once I added the cheese and Basil. Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!",
