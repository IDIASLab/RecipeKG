First I'd say for those just trying this and may be on a time schedule that additional time should be allowed. Meaning. that after this comes out of the oven it should be allowed time to cool some and \"set\".  Oh it can definitely be eaten right out of the oven, but I personally think it's a little better cooled. And MUCH easier to serve once cooled some and it sets. I'd say 20 -30 min. Just my opinion of course. Also, I added a can (15 oz.) of diced potatoes (easier than cooking and chopping just 1 or 2 potatoes) and1 chopped onion. I LOVE onions, and put them in everything. But those two extra ingredients made this Great recipe even better. In my opinion.",
