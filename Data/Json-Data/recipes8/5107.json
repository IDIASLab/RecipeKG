We just added some butter and sour cream when they came out of the air fryer.  Just one comment: the seasoning may be a bit heavy for some folks, so just use your best judgment on what\u2019s right for you.  Air fryer temperature times vary depending on your brand; mine took an extra 6 minutes to cook through.  Just delicious, my new way to bake potatoes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

Once finished I rub oil on the potato and salt and pepper it.  I then cut the potato in half lengthwise and put more oil on the flesh.  I then put it in the air fryer for about 16 minutes.  I love the soft flesh and the crispy skin.  Perfect every time.  Also great for making potato skins.",
