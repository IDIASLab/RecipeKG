The lemon came through nicely, but the sprigs of rosemary simply dried up and blackened.  I love fresh rosemary with chicken, and perhaps chopping up the leaves and marinating with the rosemary, garlic and lemon would build the flavor I'm looking for.  I'm also thinking that using these ingredients in a compound butter and then rubbing under the skin would be an awesome way to infuse more flavor.",

Scaled the recipe up to accommodate about 60 people and I used whole chickens sectioned, had a light layer of olive oil to the bottom of the pan and applied the rosemary lightly all over, And very finely minced the Garic, and layered the lemon slices evenly on top as well as the onion slices. I also included carrot and celery with it and it turned out great, Amazing flavor and if you cover it and roast it in a convection oven it melts in your mouth, definitely recommend this recipe.",
