I used 3/4 cup vodka but it still tastes strong (and I'm definitely not a 'weak drink' kinda' gal!)  Also - I was impatient and only let the watermelon puree stay in the freezer for an hour - letting this freeze seems like a crucial step (esp to achieve the slushy consistency that will make this drink awesome.)  Let me take another sip.... ahhh... maybe a little more melon liquour?  The triple sec suggestion sounds like a good one.  Maybe a tad more simple syrup?  Then again maybe it's my watermelon that is not the sweetest?  (Now that I'm buzzed and can't stop adding my opinions... I think it's best I leave! I froze the leftover concoction and will pop it in the blender again tomorrow and see how it fares when it's in a slushy state.)  Happy sipping! :)  ",
