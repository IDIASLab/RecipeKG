I used a meringue/marshmallow frosting and put it on a low broil for approximately three minutes after the cupcake had already been cooked, and the results of the entire cupcake were fabulous. There were issues with it sticking to both silicone and paper muffin liners, so I'll prep those next time to prevent sticking. I noticed, by the next day, they didn't stick so much to the wax paper liners, but still stuck to the silicone liners. Also, my cooking time took a little longer, so just make sure you check it while the time is up and add minutes as needed. Also, do not overfill any more than the recipe author stated. This reminded me of a certain cream filled cupcake that is store bought, but better. The marshmallow frosting is definitely the way to go with this. Overall, very good!",
