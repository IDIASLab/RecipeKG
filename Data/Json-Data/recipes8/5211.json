I doubled the recipe and didn't measure the veggies. I chose to leave out the olives and increased the vinegar and decreased the oil a bit for personal preference. I didn't have fresh dill so I used a few tablespoons of dried. This will be a go to whenever I have extra veggies to use or lose. THANKS for the recipe!",

I did put kalamata olives in the second time which was ok but it didn't wow me until I put the pimento stuffed green in (secret ingredient!). Feta takes it over the top.
