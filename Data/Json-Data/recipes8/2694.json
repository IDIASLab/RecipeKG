For ease of preparation, I got a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the deli counter instead of the chicken breasts - way faster and easier, and the meat is really flavorful.  Just take it off the bones, give it a rough chop and you're done.  My no-nonsense, meat&potatoes husband requested a big batch of soup to take camping!  Nice and sniffle-inducing spicy; adjust the cayenne or serve with a big spoonful of sour cream for the faint of heart. I've already sent the recipe to four people; my family loves it, and so do my husband's camping buddies.  This will go into heavy rotation for us! Garnish with any combo of: crunchy  tortilla strips (save a few tortillas to make some fresh-sprinkle lightly with onion powder); some remaining cilantro; sour cream, shredded cheese; avocado; and whatever you do, don't skip a squeeze of fresh lime!",

I did two things differently -- first, I cooked the chicken with the spices in the first step of the recipe so the chicken meat would absorb the flavors.  Secondly, I was out of corn tortillas so I used tortilla chips that I just crumbled in the bottom of the bowl before adding the soup. (I felt that the tortillas added at the beginning got too mushy).",

Do whatever you can to reduce the oil. 3) Follow rest of recipe. 4) Garnish with fried tortilla strips and maybe a mexican cheese such as Queso Quesadilla.",

Overall, this is a great recipe I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I felt something was MISSING. I can't say exactly what. If anyone has any suggestions I hope they post it. I used all the same garnishes as suggested. However, it seems a key spice is perhaps lacking. Though, I have to say DON'T LET THIS ONE PASS YOU BY...",

I used about one and half pounds of boneless chicken breasts that I sprinkled with Spicy Mrs. Dash and cookd for 5 minutes in my George Forman grill.  I let it cool while I made the rest of the soup and then cut it up into bite sized pieces!  My son makes it all the time now and loves it!  In fact, I have made it for many a guest and this recipe is truly a HIT!!! I did make sure that I used really fresh cumin (not one that had been sitting on my spice shelf for years) and I think that made a big difference.  I love the flavor of the corn tortillas that cook with the soup and I really don't care that they are NOT crispy.  One can add the tortilla strips when serving it along with the addition of some ripe avocado and extra chopped cilantro.  It really is better the next day.  Thanks again!  Amy Pla",
