We also like to add apple slices to the mix. Sliced Pork Tenderloin is the best pork to use. I usually double the mix ingredients because of the amount of meat from the tenderloin.",

Use a dollop of prepared mustard if you don't have powdered. I skipped the bacon completely. I used this recipe twice with a pork loin once baked and once in the crockpot. I served the kraut and mashed potatoes as a side. Some buttered spaetzl with carraway seed would work too.",

Skipped the bacon but bet its yummy. Skipped sugar and broth. Put the chops in a greased casserole dish. In a mixing bowl I mixed the home made applesauce drained and pressed canned sour kraut. Eyeballed it about 2:1 applesauce:kraut. Covered the chops with the mixture covered with foil and baked for 20 mins. Rested for 20 mins covered (I needed my oven for 2 loaves bread). Uncovered casserole and baked uncovered 5 mins at 450. Used meat thermometer to monitor doneness. Served with broccoli home made whole wheat bread green salad. Yum. Easy! Tastes and looks like you worked hard. Love it. Family loved it. Would be great with caramelized onions and caroway seeds added or those french onion crunchy things over the top.",
