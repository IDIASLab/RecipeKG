        "description": "My kids love the taquitos we get at the grocery store in the freezer aisle. They would happily eat them every day. However, the mean mommy that I am, am working on reducing the amount of processed food in our diet so I had to try homemade. After checking all the recipes for taquitos I could find, I decided to mix it up and create my own! So I took ideas from about 4 different recipes and went to town. My kids and husband have given their seal of approval. My very picky 3-year-old even had seconds! I serve them on a bed of lettuce with sour cream and do Mexican rice on the side.",

The filling tastes similar to the stuff you get in the frozen aisle except even tastier and a lot more fresh! I followed the recipe exactly using shredded rotisserie chicken to save time. However I had a problem with the sides of the tortillas splitting. In my first batch the sides of every taquito split open although luckily the contents stayed mostly intact. I made a second batch and doused them with cooking spray this time and I still had 80% of them split on the sides during baking. While they were still tasty this was a presentation issue as well as a little bit of a texture issue with the exposed filling becoming a little dry. Next time I will try flour tortillas to see if that helps.",

None of the tortillas cracked:) This is s good recipe that you can alter to taste. Thanks for the recipe:)",
