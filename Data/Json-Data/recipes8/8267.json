I cubed a bunch of potatoes and placed those in the bottom layered sliced onions on top of that. I browned the sausage (I used the regular sausages cut up not the skinny links). Placed the sausage on tops of the onions and my sauce mixture over the top. I added a little more BBQ sauce and used 1/4 C. brown sugar. I added a little Worchestershire sauce and prepared mustard as well. Hubby said the meal was PERFECT! Also I used fresh herbs for everything. Will deffinitely make this again will be especially good come Fall and Winter.",

I started by chopping the potatoes and putting them to boil. Then I chopped the onions garlic & the sausage while I was boiling the cubed red potatoes. I also pre-mixed the spices so that it would be ready to go. Once you start sauteeing the garlic and onions it all goes pretty quick so you need to be prepared. The directions were a little ambiguous but I think just on the cooking & cutting of the potatoes. I took another reviewer's suggestion of putting the cheese on for the last 10 minutes & it was perfect. The final product is a little soupy but who said a casserole had to be dry & stay all stacked up nicely. I am thinking of next time adding some zuchinni or squash & maybe some french fried onions to add some different flavors and textures.",
