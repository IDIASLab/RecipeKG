I have gotten better results with a regular bottle of barbecue sauce and a variety of \"skin-on\" chicken. I thought the skinless thighs came out dry and I cooked them for just under 5 hours on low. Next time I will stick with a regular bottle of barbecue sauce skin-on chicken and remove the skin before eating. This helps reduce a dry piece of chicken.",

I have a BBQ sauce recipe that I clipped from the newspaper many years ago from a BBQ restaurant in Oklahoma City and it just never lets me down. I cooked this in my Instant Pot using the slow cooker feature checked the meat temperature at just over two hours and it already was done. I scaled the recipe down to three servings from eight so there was less meat in the pot but I still would recommend you watch your time. It just doesn t get much easier than this to put a juicy tender flavorful chicken entree on the dinner table.",

Then when you put it in the crockpot and all the juice from the chicken comes out it s even runnier. Mine never actually glazed over like it should have. I m sorry but I did not like this recipe. First off the chicken in the bag was not actually full thighs it was just all pieces. Also I believe all meat needs some kind of fat when you cook it to keep from drying out so bad and being stringy and tough as this did. Guess I will try to pull it more and try to make barbecue sandwiches out of it tomorrow.",

It would have been just as good with just the bbq sauce. The flavor was great but the dish came out soupy and the meat was chewy. I drained the juices and reduced them on the stove to thicken it up which helped a lot but it didn't change the texture of the meat. I admit I don't use the bags of frozen uncooked chicken so it might just be that. I am going to make these again this time using bone- in chicken thighs from the refrigerator case. I have a feeling that the frozen pieces had too much water in them and that's what happened. It made a pretty picture; and like another reviewer I warmed up some of the bbq sauce and poured it on top of it.",

I usually precook my skin on chicken in a stock pot on the stove and finish off on the bbq or broiler with bbq sauce. Using this method allows the flavor to permeate the meat leaving the bbq sauce taste more prevalent. I didn't add honey because the sauce I used Sweet Baby Ray's was plenty sweet on it's own. I also didn't have creole mustard so I just used some stone ground dijon. I used my Instant Pot on the slow cook function on low and set for 6 hours. Worked perfectly. When done the chicken is not pretty or very picture worthy but tasty nonetheless. I added some warmed up bbq sauce for a better presentation but for flavor it really wasn't necessary. This method would be worth repeating for a busy weeknight dinner.",
