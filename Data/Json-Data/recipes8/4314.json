I will say, I have a trifle bowl that has a stand on the bottom (I hope that makes sense).  Therefore, it is not one big glass bowl.  Because of this, I do not think you will need 3 lbs of strawberries.  2lbs in my case would have been plenty.  Same with the pound cake.  One would have been enough (I made my own so I knew I would have leftovers).  Also,  I did not use the rum.  I think it would have added a really nice touch but I didn't have any and I am serving this to kids as well.  Overall, really nice.",
