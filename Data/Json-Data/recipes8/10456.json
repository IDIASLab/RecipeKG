        "description": "Orejas (the word means \"ears\") are our version of French palmiers: puff pastry coated generously on both sides with cinnamon sugar, rolled up, and sliced into cookies that look like hearts, or the ears they're named after. As the cookies bake, the sugar coating melts and caramelizes; we like them dark, crusty, and crunchy.
