I made as first instructed and took a taste and found it a little bland, so I did as a few others instructed and put in some mustard.  (I used Dijon and about 2 tsps.  That made it much better!) The olives definately gave it that extra kick that my old recipe was missing!\r\nLoved using the potato masher! Made it so creamy.  Served over lettuce instead of as sandwich, as I'm not a big bread fan! \r\nI will be making this again!  Thanks!",

I usually dispense with the celery too. But the lettuce is a must. Don't forget to salt and pepper to taste too. I am always a lot more generous with the olives too. I've been making egg and olive salad for years. It's my favorite. When there are non-olive lovers around you can always make your favorite egg salad recipe and then add sliced or chopped olives on the sandwich instead of mixing them into the salad. I used to get egg and olive sandwiches made in a restaurant this way. It tastes just as good.",

What is too salty/not enough salt, bland/bold, too peppery/needed pepper varies, depending on whose palate is doing the tasting!  So\u2026if it\u2019s too bland, add some seasoning!  I added pretty much the first thing I grabbed, some Sazon seasoning and a bit of ground mustard, tho\u2019 any number of things I had in my spice cabinet would have worked \u2013 Penzey\u2019s Fox Point Seasoning,  Jane\u2019s Krazy Mixed Up Salt, Lawrey\u2019s Seasoned Salt, celery Salt, garlic salt, even Montreal Steak Seasoning \u2013 and the list could go on. Seems too peppery?  Again, add it to taste!  Start with a small amount, add more if you like. There are no boo-boos that way.  I didn\u2019t mash the eggs; I prefer my egg salad chunkier, however\u2026 if you were going to make canap\u00e9s with this, on rye rounds, for example, with a garnish of fresh dill or parsley, the mashed version would not only spread better, it would be more fitting and easier to eat as a finger food.  Also, it\u2019s no problem to add more or less mayonnaise to your liking.  I didn\u2019t measure; I just dumped it in there till it was the way I wanted it.  To please both Hubs\u2019 and my palates, I knew we\u2019d like the bite of fresh green onion and the crunch of chopped celery, so I added both.  I\u2019ve never added green olives before (tho\u2019 I recall adding them to AR\u2019s \u201cMother-in-Law Eggs\u201d and liking them) and, while I may not add them routinely, I did enjoy them for something different than \u201cthe usual.\u201d",
