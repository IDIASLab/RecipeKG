I used a rather large spaghetti squash, and it still produced quite a bit of moisture, even after draining. As such, I found that I needed to bake this casserole about 40 minutes to get it to thicken a bit (this is my bad, not anything to do with the recipe). I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and sliced mozzarella instead of shredded; as that's what I had on hand. The majority of the flavor of this casserole comes from whatever flavor your tomato sauce is--so just be aware of that. Additional herbs/spices wouldn't be a bad idea. I had some fresh oregano, and threw some of that on at the end--that tasted pretty good. This made for a nice dinner when served with some crusty bread. Thank you for the recipe!",

Used cubed chicken breast instead of ground chicken, and added a green pepper.  Delicious. This seems to be a flexible recipe; one could change or add ingredients as desired. Looking forward to leftovers.",
