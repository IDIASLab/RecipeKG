I just did a quick saute of the pepper bacon.  I mixed everything in the crockpot and cooked 6 hours low, last two hours high (lid removed) to thicken this and meld the flavors.

They really were the best baked beans I've ever had. \n\nI cooked them covered for an hour as directed,  but then cooked them uncovered for about 10 minutes so they would thicken up and they turned out very well, not too much liquid.  \n\nMy store didn't have canned Great Northern Beans, and I don't care for Garbanzo Beans,  so I used two cans of Pinto beans, two cans of Bush's Original Baked Beans, and one can of kidney beans,  plus I used a really good, thick Applewood Smoked Bacon which added a great flavor and texture.\n\nI  loved how simple this was to make!

I don't think it matters. Going to a potluck tomorrow night and I was instructed that I MUST bring my 'world famous' beans. Thanks for this recipe.  Added 1/29/2010 - Still love this recipe and fall back on it often, especially for groups. I've started adding ground allspice and Tabasco to taste - those two things really punch it up and make a great recipe even better.  8/29/19 still one of hub's favorites. We're eating plant based now so we skip the bacon but add liquid smoke hickory flavor and it's still delicious.",
