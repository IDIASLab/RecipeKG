I made this subbing 1/2 packet of Stevia for the Sweet 'n Low. I followed the rest of the recipe as listed reducing by one half. I think next time I will try the salad with less balsamic vinegar or by subbing apple cider vinegar. I had to add quite a bit of salt to my serving to enhance the flavor. Overall it was a refreshing change from the usual tomato-cucumber-onion salad.",
