This stuffing was the favorite of everyones at Thanksgiving ! One friend of mine took the majority home without leaving much else\nfor anyone else, there was almost a mutiny. The fact that this was stovetop was genius because I didn\u2019t have the space, I live in a small condo and had so many dishes to make.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about Chef John is not only the how to on his cooking videos it\u2019s also the WHYs. Why things are cooked, chopped, baked, saut\u00e9ed, boiled etc etc etc! The technique he provides sets his recipes over the edge. Make this, you WILL NOT regret it! \n\nLove you Chef John!\n\nP.S. Use homemade stock (get with it)",
