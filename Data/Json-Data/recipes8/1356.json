I made it in a rush and didn t notice there wasn t any baking powder or soda in the recipe until I was already halfway through making it. There s no way you d have a cake like this without leavening so I added 1 teaspoon baking powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. The cake was very dense even with the baking powder I added so I can t imagine what it is like without. Like other reviewers I was disappointed as there isn t enough cake and it certainly isn t a coffee cake. The end result was edible but disappointing. I won t make again. Thank you for the recipe but I d love to know if the author maybe forgot to add leavening to the recipe.",
