I was searching and searching for the healthy and delicious baked goods and the idea of moist banana muffin yet entirely whole wheat flour muffin was very tempting. It was very moist. I added organic chia seeds to the flour mixture, and used 1/2 cup of unpasturized honey and 1/2 organic cane sugar instead of white and brown sugar for the topping. I also added organic walnuts on the top. It came out beautifully. Thank you so much for inventing this recipe!!!!!",

Hubs and niece really enjoyed them; niece says 4 1/2 stars.  Hubs says he'd like more banana flavor--but it was good as is, and he says he always would like more banana flavor.  I don't have a flour sifter, so just put the wheat flour in the KA for a while and ran it--wasn't sure it'd work, but it did.  Muffins came out moist and not at all dense.  Thanks for the recipe!",
