The fresh herbs were pungent and really came through as they should have. I ended up serving them with a little bit of gravy but they didn't need it. I especially liked that this was only 2 servings since it was just the two of us this Thanksgiving. I will make this often when my herb garden is thriving. Thanks for sharing!",
