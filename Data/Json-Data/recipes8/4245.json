Cooking time is minimal, making one wonder why all the fuss to use a pressure cooker instead of traditional steamer basket. I have found that this method creates a crisp but tender vegetable with minimal mess and much safer than an open steamer set-up. This recipe uses a two-tier, 6.5-inch basket with lid, in a 6-quart pot.",
