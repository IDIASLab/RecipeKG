You may omit the red pepper and cayenne if you do not like spicy foods, or increase like we do! We serve this over brown rice to make it more of a whole meal. We love it! I used roasted garlic-flavored tomato sauce for extra 'kick.'",

So I doubled the spices and added more salt and pepper and it turned out pretty good. My husband and I added some red pepper paste on the side since we left out the cayenne and red pepper. It was just like a spring roll but without the roll...which my husband doesn't like and they take a lot of extra time so this worked out perfectly! I couldn't fit it all in my skillet so I did boil some of the cabbage in a different pot then added it as it cooked down but I ended up leaving some of the cabbage out. We'll make this recipe again with doubled spices. Thanks for a good cabbage recipe!",
