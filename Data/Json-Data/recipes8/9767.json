        "description": "This recipe was contributed to Allrecipes by TV host, author, and recipe developer Chadwick Boyd: Ramps are wild onions that grow mostly in the Eastern United States. Their season typically is mid-April to mid-May, depending on weather. They are hot ticket items in farmers' markets and typically are snapped up fast. Most people like to chop up ramps and use them like scallions in dishes, such as quiche or stir-fry. Others like to make compound butter or ramp pesto. I prefer to quickly soften them whole and preserve them in a mix of olive oil, vinegar, and honey to have on hand.",
