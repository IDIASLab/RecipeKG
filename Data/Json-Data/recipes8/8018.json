It was not - knock-me-down WOW (It IS chicken) - but it had enough flavor that it was great for kids and adults. The kids loved it. I could barely tell there were apples in it. I didn't have sage or celery but I will be sure to get those for next time. I might also add in some craisins. I fine-diced the apples onions and carrots before I read the directions. They all got sauteed for the same amount of time - which I am glad! Next time I will just buy the Mirepoix mix at the grocery store and save the prep time. I also scaled the recipe to one pound no problems there. There were no leftovers! I will definitely try this again!",

I only used about 2 tablespoons of chopped onion and about 1 stalk of celery. I left out the pepper (my husband hates pepper) and the sage. The poultry seasoning I used already had quite a bit of sage in it so I didn't want to overdo it. I used 1 cup of breadcrumbs instead of 1/2 cup. The mixture was too 'wet' with only 1/2 cup. Lastly I didn't use mustard for the glaze. I'm not a big fan of mustard. So I substituted it with 2 tablespoons of Jack Daniel's Honey Smokehouse BBQ sauce instead (I'm sure any BBQ would do). It took an extra 10 minutes or so in my oven for the center to reach 180 degrees. I served it with homemade mashed potatoes and green beans. It was fabulous!",
