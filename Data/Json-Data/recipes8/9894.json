        "description": "There are a lot of Buffalo chicken dip recipes but I feel certain this is one of the very best. Made with freshly cooked chicken, this is way better than recipes that call for the canned stuff. It's super rich and creamy with the perfect amount of tang. I highly recommend the optional blue cheese crumbles on top! Great served at room temperature so it's perfect for a party. Serve with celery and carrot sticks or corn chips.",
