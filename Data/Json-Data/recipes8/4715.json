For instance, I didn't have cumin, so I added extra coriander and garam masala (probably an extra tsp of each or so), I used coconut milk(double what it calls for)  instead of full cream beacuse we eat dairy free. I used cardamom essential oil instead of pods. Great recipe!",

Curious about the \"fresh red chili pepper\" ingredient - there are so many chili peppers out there, it would be good to know exactly which ones - serrano?  I used one large jalapeno, but that doesn't really add heat.  I would add some cayenne pepper next time so it's a little spicy.  Also, the recipe never tells you when to add the chicken back in - I assumed after blending the sauce.  Very time consuming and I will have everything prepped beforehand to make it a little easier.",
