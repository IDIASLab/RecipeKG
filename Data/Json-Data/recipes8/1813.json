And it is!   The only change I made was I didn't use the whole package of cookies for the crust. I don't like a ton of crust even though it is delicious, I don't think it's necessary. I didn't freeze it for two hours either.  I popped it in the freezer but took it out and put the filling in when I was done making it.  Otherwise, I made it as written.  Highly recommend!",
