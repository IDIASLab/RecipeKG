Stir frequently when adding zucchini. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned (first of the season!) and added a yellow bell pepper and 1 minced jalape\u00f1o a couple minutes prior to adding the tomatoes.  I used a tsp of Italian seasoning (why a pinch?). Since I opted this as a side dish for BLT\u2019s, I used a couple TBLS of bacon grease IPO the olive oil. Overall; nice dish that we really liked and a good starting point in which to play off of! I have tons of zucchini (and yellow summer squash!) so I will make this again! Thanks!!",
