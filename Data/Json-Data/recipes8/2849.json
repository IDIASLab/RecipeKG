I used about 3/4 cup green chili salsa instead of the green chiles in the cream sauce, and I put the small can of green chiles in with the filling.  I also created a bed of cooked white rice with whole corn and diced roasted red peppers in the baking dish, and then put the enchiladas on it, which soaked up the extra cream sauce nicely and made a yummy side dish.  It might have been too much cream sauce otherwise. ",

I also added some garlic powder,cumin, & paprika.When I rolled the tortillas with the chicken and cheese, I spooned a little bit of sauce on top before rolling them.Baked them at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.I used a 9x12 dish and was able to squeeze a couple extra tortillas in there.My husband loved this dish!!

For the sauce I added some more minced jalepeno, cumin, chipotle and salt.  I put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes to finish off before the garnishes.

My mom got me one of the roasters that are like the beer can thing, anyway, when this chicken came out of the oven it was a work of art in itself!! I shredded it, mixed in the onions and cheese. I added some of the chicken liquid so it was  nice and moist. At this point, the old man could hardly contain himself.. I'll help..I'll help...SURE..so we got them all rolled, we made 24..and the sauce came out great. I used fresh green chili and we both thought it could have used more (next time). ANYWAY...they were heavenly!! This is the only recipe I will ever use!! I'm toying with the idea of using shredded pork, onions and cheese in the corn tortillas, smothered in red chili, (old man makes killer red chili)and covered in TONS of cheese. Ummmm..anyway, it's 7:30am and I can hardly wait till supper!! lol Thanks for passing this on to us!",
