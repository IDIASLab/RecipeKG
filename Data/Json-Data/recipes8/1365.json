I made many changes, starting with the fact that I was using strawberries and canned peaches. I'm also out of cinnamon, which isn't in this recipe anyway, so I added ground cloves,  nutmeg, vanilla extract and brown sugar to the fruit mixture. \n\nSo that the crust would have more flavor I added nutmeg, ground cloves and on a whim I added just a little ground ginger. GAME CHANGER! My family absolutely loved it and there's hardly any left. My only surprise was how thick the crust ended up in comparison to when I put it in the oven. Next time I'll definitely double the fruit to match the recipe but I was using what I had on hand",
