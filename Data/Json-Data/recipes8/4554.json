What we have here is a very familiar pizza-like flavor profile, but the delivery system is unlike anything you've ever experienced. The outside edges are crispy and crunchy while that saucy and cheesy center is much like a pasta in texture. So, while this is vaguely similar to a lot of things, it's really unlike anything else.",

Otherwise found this very easy to make. \n\nI'll note that the dough can be rested in the fridge for several days. When I mixed up the dough I did the full batch and after dividing I tossed one of the dough balls into the fridge for three or four days before cooking it. I let it warm up and rise for about  2.5 hours. \n\nThe finished product  it outstanding and very unique. I stuck close to the recipe my first attempts with red sauce, cheese and a little arugula. To bake I dusted a peel with semolina and slid scacce directly onto a baking stone in the hot oven, cook 15 minutes and let it cool on a rack for ten. Nice crisp, chewy bread exterior and a lovely saucy pasta-like interior. This will be a fun dish to play around with now that I've got the basic process down!",

And I made this with coarse rava (I should have ground it more) and therefore the first one I made just collapsed. But the second and third ones came out perfectly (though it took me about twice the amount of time that Chef John said). And, it smells so much like a pizza. Its my first try, so I forgive myself for the mistakes. Though maybe covering the dough with a bowl may have worked better. It kind of dried out under the towel. And I had to work it for several more minutes to make it smooth. Thank you Chef, I love trying out your recipes.",
