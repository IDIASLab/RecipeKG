Instead of cutting down sugar if you dont want it as sweet simply add a little cranberry juice or to be more like a true chutney add small amounts of apple cider vinegar towards the end of cooking to your preference. I add 1/4 cup red onion and a clove of garlic also a little oriental 5 spice and cinnamon. about 4 or 5 good size oranges will give you the cup of juice and zest. Fresh ginger if possible. This is a delicious chutney recipe good for many uses be creative! Going over brie stuffed chicken with prosciutto and wilted greens yum!",
