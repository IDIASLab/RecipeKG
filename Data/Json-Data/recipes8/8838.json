Perfect next to your holiday ham or turkey, this green bean casserole has a creamy, rich cheese sauce that enhances, but doesn't cover up, the green beans, so they are still the star of the show. Even though your family's probably expecting the same old green bean casserole you've been making for decades (the one with condensed soup, a ton of cheese, and way too many bread crumbs or French-fried onions), once they try this one, it might become a new holiday trend!",

I wanted something more luscious and less slimy than a traditional green bean casserole for Thanksgiving, so I made Chef John\u2019s green beans au gratin with changes to bridge the gap.  To this recipe, I added:\n\n- 1/2 cup more cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\n- 2 shallots sliced into 1/4 inch rounds\n- 8 oz. baby Bella mushrooms\n- 6 oz. center cut bacon slices, cut into 1/2 inch pieces\n- Minced garlic\n\nI fried the bacon and then sweated the mushrooms in the leftover fond and grease, breaking them apart into small pieces with a spoon.  I then added the shallots, followed by the garlic after the shallots began to turn translucent.  I mixed everything together as directed, and baked.\n\nI did substitute gouda for the comt\u00e9, because I couldn\u2019t find the recommended cheese where I lived and was already using gouda for another recipe anyway.  Overall, I highly recommend this.  Green beans au gratin was decimated by my family, the majority of whom (I found out after dinner) don\u2019t even -like- green bean casserole.  Give this a shot!  It may become your new tradition too.",
