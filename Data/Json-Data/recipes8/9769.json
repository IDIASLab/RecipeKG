One could argue that this recipe is one of those times, since we could just cook some sausage and serve it next to our potato pancakes-but I could, and did, stuff mine with sausage, and I very much enjoyed how they came out. Besides, if you're going to skip the sausage stuffing, this recipe is a reminder of just how easy potato pancakes are to make.",
