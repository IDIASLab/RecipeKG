I would have added some cinnamon if my hubby didn't dislike that flavor so much. Please try it! Here's what I did.",

It turned out really great - so tasty and surprisingly filling!\nI had to make some tweaks, which is not something I usually do (I'm a nervous cooker).  I was out of eggs so per the interwebs I used 1 Tbl Cornstarch and 2 Tbls water to equal 1 egg.  I also realized I did not have the quick cooking McCann's, so I did a mixture of partially cooked oats and some instant regular oatmeal that I had on hand.  I also decided to try the cinnamon mentioned in the description by sprinkling it on top before they went in the oven.  It smelled SO GOOD when the cooked.  They were a big crumbly in the end - but that actually gave them a unique charm and the flavor and texture were both just perfect.  Thanks so much!  These were our Christmas morning breakfast!",

It's much too dry and nothing will bind so I end up with a tray full of crumbled cookies. The amount of dough is not nearly enough to absorb 3 cups of oatmeal so you end up with oats everywhere. They cover the outside of the cookie and it looks like I rolled them in oatmeal after I got done cooking them I had almost a cup worth of oats just fall off the cookies after they were baked. This was a total disaster and the cookies are mostly inedible. Probably going to throw them out. Definitely will not ever make this again.",
