Instead I grated some bread into a bowl - about 8 slices (after letting the slices sit out flat on the counter to dry out for a couple of hours). And then added enough melted butter to make it moist (about 1/2 cup) and added the cooked celery and onion as per recipe directions. I also added celery salt and pepper and poultry seasoning for flavor. This stuffing is much better then the box and not difficult to make. I also put some rosemary salt and pepper in the vegetable oil and rubbed it under the turkey skin rather then over the exterior. Keep in mind that a convection oven will cook a 12 pound turkey in just a little over half the time. Mine was ready in just over 2 hours. But make sure you check that the stuffing reaches 165 degrees.",

I never made a turkey before this and I must say it really gave me a major boost of confidence in my cooking skills. My nine-year-old even helped. She didn't want to put her hand inside for the stuffing but did everything else with me. She could probably do it herself next time because it was so easy! Before rubbing the turkey exterior with veggie oil I pierced it all over with a large fork to allow the spices to get in then seasoned and \"massaged\" the exterior. The package of the turkey suggested adding strips of bacon to the exterior for additonal flavoring which I did also. It was truly among the moistest turkeys I have ever eaten. Thank you for helping make my holiday the best I have had in years.",
