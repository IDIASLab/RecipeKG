I took them to a halloween potluck for my husbands unit and they went so fast i didn't even get to try one!! I even won the best dish contest and my husband gets a 3 day weekend!! I used corn tortillas because i didn't have flour and they worked great i think it gave them more flavor! I also soaked the toothpicks in water so they didn't burn! I will def make them again!",

I used hot dogs and cut small flour tortillas in half sprinkled the tortilla halves with cheese then rolled them up with a hot dog in the center. Secured with toothpicks and baked. When they were out of the oven I took out the toothpicks and the melted cheese held the \"bandages\" down. I think they turned out really cute and were a fun spooky quick dinner for Halloween.",

I think adding something inside the wrap would make it better (maybe even something a little sweet?). Also if I do this again I'll add red food coloring to ketchup (make it really 'bloody') and drizzle more on the 'bandages'. Might even try to find a wrap that looks more 'bandage-y'.",
