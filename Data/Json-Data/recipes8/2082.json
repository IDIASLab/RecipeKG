I think I crushed my crackers too much and added too much butter .. the dough was thick and after 17 minutes it was just a thick doughy mass in the bottom of my pan. I think it would work fine without the corn syrup... regular Graham cracker crusts do not call for it so I'm not sure it's purpose. I'll try it again and measure more precisely and leave out the corn syrup.",

I baked them at 350 F until golden brown. Very toasty. OMG what a yummy delish crumb! I made some cupcakes with guava filling, cream cheese icing and topped with these  toasted saltine crumbs and everybody raved about the crumbs! I also ate them by themselves like a snack so good!",
