For crunch and a bit of texture I added a very thin layer of finely shredded lettuce and as I was rolling, used a bit of fingertip pressure to keep things together and for security, I skewered the rolls with long bamboo picks onto which I'd pierced whole green and black olives and the smallest cherry tomatoes I could find. Upped the eye appeal a bit, more festive and filling as well. This is a good starter app, you can adapt it as you please. But the basic filling recipe is great. Thanks.",
