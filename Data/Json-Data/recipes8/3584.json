        "description": "This is a flavorful way to easily cook 2-inch steaks in your kitchen. This oven-to-stovetop method will make your steaks tender and juicy and create an awesome golden brown crust. Cooking your steaks in a low-temperature oven allows for great control over the temperature. Use a remote thermometer probe that provides the temperature reading throughout the process if you can. Finish the steaks by searing in a hot cast iron pan, basting with butter, herbs, and garlic to form a nice glaze.",
