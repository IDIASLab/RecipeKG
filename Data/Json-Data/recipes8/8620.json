I'm not sure how Moroccan this recipe really is (at least enough to rip off a Casablanca quote apparently) but it's hardly worth researching once you taste it. I did fail to have on hand lemon juice having used the last of it in some hummus a few days ago so that part is missing. I'm guessing it would have helped to further balance the sweetness which should have been easily predicted seeing the ingredient list. That being said I personally like a little spice in these sorts of dishes so I may just add some form of chile pepper whether it be fresh or dried in my next preparation of this dish which I believe will be much sooner than much later. Regardless of it's very few shortcomings I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship (couldn't help it).",

We cubed and browned the eggplant but didn't add it to the crockpot until there was about 2 hours left in the crockpot. Other minor changes included adding 1/2 can of black beans (the cumin seemed to be calling for them) about 1 tsp paprika and a few shakes of hot sauce as some of the other reviews said it needed to be spicier. It was very easy to make and it made enough for my husband and I to eat all week!! I knew it was a good dinner when my husband told me it was a great find on the website. I think we will make this for company next time.",

                "reviewBody": "This is delicious. The smells while cooking were incredible and the flavor was just amazing! I could only give it four stars for two reasons. First the chicked cooked down so much it practically disintegrated. It was hard to find the chicken amongst all the vegetables. Second the onion which we usually love in anything had a strange chewy texture. Hubby and I both pushed it aside. It might be better sauted first to carmelize and give it flavor and tenderness. Of course the risk would be disintegrating after cooking so long but that might enhance the flavor. The flavors were mouth watering so I'll try to adjust either bigger pieces of chicken whole thighs or something that keeps the chicken from disappearing.",

The only change I made to the spices was to add freshly grated ginger. Maybe that made the difference maybe not but I would definitely do it the same again. I did put three frozen chicken breasts directly on the bottom of the crockpot ommitting the beginning step which made this even faster and easier. The chicken shredded perfectly after about four hours on high. Also the added eggplant didn't seem to either be necessary or detract from this recipe. I'll add it again next time only if I have it on hand or it's on sale. Otherwise I wouldn't bother. It kind of got lost in the dish and wasn't needed. Everything else was perfect!",

We hate eggplant at my house and since everyohne said it cooked down to nothing I just didnt see a reason to add the slimey gook to the recipe. I used a large butternut squash instead--peeled seeded and cut in one-inch cubes. It was probalby about 3-4 cups total. Everything else I kept the same. 5 Hours on high was way too long as pretty much everything turned to mush but the flavor was out of this world. The seasonings were spot on. Next time I will use real garlic not garlic-salt and will add less broth/liquid. It was on the wet side. I think I'll also try cooking this in my dutch oven in the oven as I think that it would benefit from some caramalization. Thank's for a tasty suggestion.",

I used frozen chicken breasts and shredded it into big chunks at the end. The chicken was delicious super moist. I left out the fruit and adjusted the sauce a little to my taste (more cumin fresh ginger etc.). It's a great base I think it would be hard to mess up. (And trust me I know how to mess up a recipe.) I served with brown rice and thought the leftovers were even tastier since the flavors seemed to blend even more.",
