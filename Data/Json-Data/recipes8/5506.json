Maybe it's the size of quinoa, or the less wheaty flavor, but for me this vibrant, bracing salad is significantly better with quinoa instead of the traditional bulgur wheat. Blanching the herbs keeps this fresh and green for several days.",

Used red quinoa because that is what I had and left out the tarragon because I didn't have any but it still turned out to be the best tabbouleh I've ever had. This will be my go-to recipe from now on. Also planning on growing some tarragon so I will have it next time. Love tabbouleh because of the taste but also because I can use my homegrown herbs. Great base for anything you want to add to it.",
