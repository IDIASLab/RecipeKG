For the lemon I added pineapple mango Svedka, for the orange I added mandarin Orange Absolute and the for the clear I added Captain Morgan. The lemon and orange kind of blended together in color, so next time I may add a little yellow food coloring so it stands out a bit more. For the top layer, I used boiling water instead of warm and I also heated up the rum a bit as well. All the adults said they were the the BEST Jello Shots they ever had! Definitely will make these again next year!",

Looked at other comments and one was helpful:\nFor top white layer- use 2 TBSP BOILING HOT water (not \"warm\"like recipe says) \nAdd unflavored gelatin and stir for a few minutes until it's dissolved and smooth like water.\nAdd 1/2 cup of rum, heated for 15 to 20 seconds in microwave, or do briefly on a pot on stovetop.\nAdd can of sweetened condensed milk, heated 20 seconds in microwave-safe dish in microwave\nAlso, if you have a cooking syringe or a turkey baster it will make the layering process faster and more accurate.\n\nEveryone, liked the shots but a few people didn't like the softer texture of the top layer. It was just a slightly different texture from the sweetened condensed milk.",

I heated up the liquor a bit added it with the warm water to the unflavored gelatin then strained any thicker gelatin chunks out before adding the warmed milk to it. This fixed my problem but preparing it as the directions read I ended up with chunks of gelatin in the sweetened milk that I could pour off the other layers.",
