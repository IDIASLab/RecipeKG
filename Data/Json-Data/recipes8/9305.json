Yes, it's hot, and yes, it's sour, but it's also so much more, and other than a little bit of slicing and dicing, this is relatively fast and simple to make. This is almost always served as an appetizer in a Chinese restaurant, but if you added some pork to this, or some little fun-sized meatballs, it would make a fantastic meal. Serve with extra sliced green onions on top.",

Have made it a couple times now and have discovered a few things - if you don\u2019t have chinese black vinegar or *seasoned* rice vinegar, you can used unseasoned rice vinegar with a splash of balsamic vinegar. If you don\u2019t like your soup quite so thick, cut the egg and the cornstarch slurry in half. Also I personally prefer a firmer tofu for the texture instead of the soft. But also delicious as is!",
