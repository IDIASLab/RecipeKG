I didn't exactly follow the recipe completely for a few reasons. I don't usually have or like white bread so I used the pb and jelly bread I'd just made. I also only have bacon crumbles not bacon so I mixed some crumbles with pb and used that as the spread on both sides of the bread then put the apples in the middle. I like it; the savory flavor of bacon goes well with peanut butter and the apples add some sweetness. I can't say if the bf would like this but it works as a simple lunch for me. Thanks!",
