I did not use the nutella, but instead I added homemade apricot jam (which I thinned out a little with water) and spread it over the whipped cream...then rolled it up and covered it with ganache.  It was outstanding!  I'm actually making it later today.  This time though, when I add the dry ingredients alternating with the butter...I'm going to \"fold\" it in by hand not mixer.  It lost a lot of it's fluffiness!  My husband loved this!  Oh, and I'm also going to try a mixture of apricot and pear jam this time as well!",
