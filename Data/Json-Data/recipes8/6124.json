I'm concerned with the comment made by PJBAHR who said they saved the marinade and added pineapple tidbits and served on the side with the chicken.  Please don't EVER reuse a marinade as a condiment or dipping sauce that raw chicken has been marinating in UNLESS you boil it first!...you run the risk of salmonella poisoning.  (You should do this with any type of marinade, no matter what kind of meat is used).\r\nThanks for the great recipe!",

I used others' recommendations and added a little grated ginger to the marinade and also before serving, thickened the marinade with some corn starch and served warm for a dipping sauce.  Even my picky son who hates EVERYTHING but the plainest of foods used the sauce.  I used 6 boneless breasts for 4 people and next time will use 8.  They were cleaned up in a flash and all were asking for more.  I cut the chicken in thick strips, two or three, depending on the size of the breast, and then skewered them in an \"s\" fashion on the skewers.  Next time, I will marinate longer.  I opened a can of pineapple rings and there was exactly 1 cup of juice in there.  I served the pineapple and made some rice and had a great meal.",
