Even the venison lovin' mighty hunter of the house didn't care for these. Sorry.",

The bourbon adds a great touch and its flavor works great with the BBQ sauce cheese and bacon. My cheese of preference is cheddar so that's what I used for the recipe. I added home made BBQ sauce tomato and spring salad. Delicious!!!",
