It took an entire extra cup of flour to pull this together into a dough that could be handled at all.  I was amazed by how much it rose within that first hour and a half!  It felt like the top of the loaf never really got a normal texture in the slow cooker so I did end up finishing it in the oven for a few minutes.  That being said- if you find yourself in the interesting predicament of owning a slow cooker but not an oven this is a great and innovative way to make a loaf of bread, but overall I'd follow the dough recipe and bake it normally if given the option.  In the future I will add more cheese and maybe top it with a sprinkle of cheese as well.  I would also add some salt to the dough rather than sprinkling it on top.  Next time I will DEFINITELY try it with jalape\u00f1os for some extra flavor and maybe even add some garlic to the dough!",
