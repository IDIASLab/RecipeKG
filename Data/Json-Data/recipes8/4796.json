I really didn't think it was a flavor combo that my family would appreciate.  Also, since we don't like wine (not even for cooking), I used 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of beef broth.  I also added an extra clove of garlic (of course).  The result was a fantastic side to our main dish and will definitely be added to our rotation!",

After reading others' reviews, I made a few changes: I used 2 bags of fresh baby spinach instead of frozen, 1/2 tsp each basil and pepper, and 2 cloves garlic. I also used white rather than red wine (personal preference!). This is an elegant, easy side dish, but it does need to go straight from the stove to the table. Fortunately it only takes a few minutes to make, so I cook it just before the other dishes are done. Thanks Leslie!",

I also used a tablespoon of Gourmet Garden garlic (already crushed so you don't have to!) instead of just one clove.  I cooked the mushrooms on medium heat in the garlic butter for appx. 10 minutes (until they were very brown).  Then I added the wine and appx. 10 sec later (mushrooms are like sponges and sop up the liquid quickly)  I tossed appx. three mittfuls of baby spinach into the pan.  I lightly tossed the spinach with the mushrooms until the leaves *just began* to wilt.  Once they reduced by half, I served the portions onto the plates right away.  Cracked pepper and parm cheese is the perfect je ne sais quoi!",

It is unbelievably easy to prepare and the flavors are magnificent. My husband loves spinach and so he was extremely happy with the perfect blend of flavors that did not overpower the spinach flavor at all and when my 22-month-old daughter ate hers (usually like pulling teeth to get her to eat anything green) I knew it was a hit. This will be prepared at least twice a month at my house. ENJOY!!!",
