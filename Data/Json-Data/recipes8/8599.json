Since the French traditionally marinate the chicken for 24 hours I did the same (in a 1/2 bottle of red wine French herbs instead of Italian garlic & minced onion). It was amazing. My English guests raved and had a second helping. The additional wine was needed for additional sauce to be sopped up with the fresh baguette I served with the meal.",
