                "reviewBody": "First off, (and I mean this in a polite way) for those of you saying there's no sense in doing this in a crock pot when you have the do the work either way with the apples, you are missing the point of having a crock pot in the first place.  It frees up your time so that you do not have to keep such a watchful eye on it.  My husband had to go work this morning, on a Sunday, and so he just switched on my crock pot for me when he left the house.  Everything was already in there...and when I woke up, I had fresh apple crisp, already cooked and just waiting to be eaten.  Moving on...this turned out perfectly!  I left my apples in slices since they were small apples.  I also adjusted this recipe to be gluten free and free of refined sugars.  I actually mixed the walnuts in with the apples rather than the topping.  And I used xylitol in place of sugar, adding some molasses to the crumb topping to add the richness of brown sugar.  I don't care for ginger in my desserts, so I just used cinnamon and nutmeg for the spices.  I also used a lot less sweeteners...only about 1/4 cup of xylitol in the apples and 1/3 cup in the crumb topping, with about 1/4 cup of the molasses.  I also omitted the cornstarch and just used a few Tbsp. of GF baking mix.  I used Earth Balance in place of butter, and it works great.  I can tell you the taste is the same, even with my changes.  I've made apple crisps the way as printed before going GF.  They are both great.",

I had my doubts but this really proved to be a great alternative! I subbed 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg for the ginger and added a couple of tsp. of vanilla to the apples that I sliced thin vs. chopping. I wanted the apples to be recognizable and not to get mushy or \"lost\" during cooking. Like others I added 1 cup of rolled oats to the topping. I cooked it for 2 hours on high tuned it down to low and then left the lid off for one hour. I do think next time I would add more apples because I ended up with more \"topping\" or \"crisp\" than apples when all was said and done. Overall it was awesome with vanilla ice cream on top!",

I did not have any success with this either and wasted a lot of ingredients. First of all it only made 6 servings so I had to double it to have enough. I have one of the new larger slow cookers so it was no problem. I used all granny smith apples. Followed directions to the letter. I left it in the slow cooker for a couple of hours on low and then uncovered it for the last hour. Finally to keep it warm for dinner I kept it on the \"keep warm\" setting\". I should have turned it off b/c it burned in the left end very badly although it did not smell burned. One of my daughters liked it - no one else cared for it. Most of it stayed in the 'fridge for the rest of the week and no one warmed any up to eat again. I agree with rae on the Apple Mush. It was very sweet. I give this a thumbs down. Even with the lid off the topping never got remotely crisp. The white ceramic bowl in my cooker is stained and I still need some good apple recipes. This makes the third one I have tried. When I told my daughter what I was cooking she said \"Oh no! Mom you always have trouble with apples!\" and I did.... perhaps it was me but I have to give this only 3 stars at best b/c I doubled it that could have been the problem.",
