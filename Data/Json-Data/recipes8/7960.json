I liked the mix of lemon and coconut, although I think I would use shredded coconut next time, or pulse the flakes a few times in the food processor to reduce the size, as I think the texture would be more pleasing without large flakes in every bite. (Also, I used unsweetened coconut, I can't imagine using sweetened--it would be overkill in this!) The consistency was great. The only real complaint is that I could taste the flour in the crust, and that wasn't ideal. I'll try to fix that if I make this again.",
