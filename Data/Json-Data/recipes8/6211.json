The second time I dipped the apples in the caramel and let them set up in the fridge for about an hour. Once they were set I rubbed a damp paper towel around the apples (to make them sticky again) and then rolled them in the trail mix. It was an extra step but they held up perfectly! Also I found them easier to eat if you slice them up. Not as much fun but definitely easier!",
