But I also would like to say that this was a really tasty dinner. I followed the recipe exactly and basted every 15 minutes. but this was just like eating a really good roasted cornish hen. Not bad but not as anticipated either.",

I marinated them overnight so I did not baste them, and I squeezed half a lemon over them and then stuffed them with the lemon halves.  They came out very dark but were delicious. I will make them again.",
