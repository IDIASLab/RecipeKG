I had to make some changes just because I did not have them available to at this time. I didn t use lamb not something I buy; also I didn t have any fresh mushroom or a can of baked beans. I used pork and bean instead. I also made the mistake of using instant potatoes. I will defiantly use real mashed potatoes next time. EXCELENT PIE!! Thanks for the recipe!!",

This really is a versatile recipe and the great thing is that when you swap out the lamb mince for beef mince you just change the name from shepherds pie to cottage pie:0) The mince base is also really great with a jacket potatoe or in a bowl with a piece of crusty bread. It's what our family calls a rib coater great on cold nights.",
