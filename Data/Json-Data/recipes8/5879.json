I was concerned they would fall apart in the pan, but they held together perfectly (used Just Mayo since I can\u2019t have eggs with no problem). I used Jan\u2019s Old Bay Seasoning Substitute on this site and omitted the salt in this recipe. The only changes I would make next time is to lightly saut\u00e9 the onion before adding to the mixture, which is a personal preference, and maybe reduce the amount of Old Bay just a tad. Enjoyed the texture and flavor of these though. Next time, I may add some grated cheddar to the mixture. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!",

I really liked this recipe and it was a nice way to change up the walleye fillets that I have in the freezer. Walleye is so mild in flavor that it really takes on any flavor you add to it. There is one flaw in the recipe and that is that you really have to add a beaten egg to the mixture as a binder. Once I had everything mixed up and tried to start forming patties I could see it wasn't going to work. I added a beaten egg and that did the trick. Thanks for sharing!",
