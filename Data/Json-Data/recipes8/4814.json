I cook the mushroom for 10 minutes at 400 degrees and then add the topping and cook for another 10 minutes.  Add whatever your favorite toppings are.  I added cooked broccoli the other day just for some extra veggie.  Delicious.  Update: After reading the reviews, a few people mentioned how watery the mushroom was.  A couple suggestions...DO NOT rinse your mushroom off under running water, mushrooms are very absorbent and will just soak up all that water.  Just take a cloth or paper towel and brush the dirt off the mushroom.  Also, try increasing the oven temp a little bit and cook the mushroom the first time around just a little longer to dry it out more.  The mushroom will always be a little watery, but hopefully with those tips it won't be as bad as some have posted.",

Also, I made the rookie mistake of rinsing the mushrooms rather than just wiping them off with a damp towel!  They were still very good, though, and they have even been better since I realized my mistakes.  I topped mine with pizza sauce, mozzarella, and tri-color bell peppers.
