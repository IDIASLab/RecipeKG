I made this for my daugher's class for her birthday and then turned around and made it for my sons class for his birthday the following week. Very easy and so cute! The second batch I made was for a preschool class so I added a broken pretzel rod in place of the popsicle sticks. (easier for them to hold plus it made the whole thing edible) So glad I found this recipe! It sure made my life easier with 2 birthdays back to back. It quickly went into my favorite recipe box.",

Because they are time consuming i find it helpful to shape all the balls of each color after the dough has chilled then put them back in the fridge. I have even done this a day ahead and baked the next day. It helps to use parchment paper with the cream cheese based dough. Also the thicker sucker sticks (wilton makes some specifically for cookie suckers) work better. If you make these be prepared to share the recipe and be ready for the kids to request them over and over.",

Used regular food coloring (didn't have any paste) and we (my kids and my nephews) made cookies for Mother's Day. Lots of fun kids can get really creative w/ this dough. We didn't use sticks just rolled into dime size balls or multi colored ropes and made designs. Will make again and again! Thanks for the recipe!",

They are so colorful and cute and a great tasting cookie also. I'm glad I did not read any reviews except the ones on the recipe page because if I had I probably would have added extra sugar as other reviewers did. I don't think these need any more sugar. They are sweet enough and buttery... yum. The only change I made to the recipe was a neccessary improvisation. I began making the dough before I realized we had used the last of the cream cheese (which I almost always have) so I subbed 1/4 C or so of sour cream and the texture of the cookie is wonderful! I will definitely make these again! (The kids haven't even seen these yet... they are in bed for the night... they're going to love them!)",

Maybe a 1/4 cup more sugar or even conf sugar. Other than that it was fun and I think to make them look the prettiest its safe to roll the colors individually and gently attach them. They get more tie-dye looking by adding all colors into one ball and rolling out. Check out the pictures posted and you can tell the difference. Will keep in my recipe box.",

It took a cookie or so to get the technique down (we were making the \"snake\" too thin) but even the mistakes have their own character.
