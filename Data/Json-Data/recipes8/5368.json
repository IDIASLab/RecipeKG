Until I made it myself and drank a cup I too was skeptical. The coconut oil and butter add just enough sweetness lighten the color and create a delicate foamy topping. If you try really hard to taste coconut oil or butter you can detect a slight hint but only because you know it's in there. Coconut oils vary in flavor with some having a very prominent coconut flavor and others none I used a coconut oil with a prominent coconut flavor and my coffee still tasted like coffee. Better to go \"lighter\" on the measurements of coconut oil and butter than to go \"heavy\" so best to measure and not eye the amounts. I would make this again in a heartbeat! THANKS for sharing such a unique and delicious way to drink coffee.",
