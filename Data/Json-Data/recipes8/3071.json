But of course, me being me, I added my own touches: 1) I made a nice slaw to go with, for added color (as my plates are not as colorful as the ones in the main picture for this recipe) and honestly it goes well with any taco or tostada recipe... red cabbage, sliced radishes, cilantro + juice of 1 lime & 1 tablespoon-ish brown sugar... usually I add siracha, 2 or so garlic cloves, cumin, coriander, etc to this slaw\u2014but as the main dish was already anticipated to be pretty spicy, I stopped at the brown sugar. Serve on top of the tacos or on the side. 2) Lime-sour cream to top it all off. Again, this goes well with any taco recipe; simply take juice of 1 lime and add sour cream and fresh cracked pepper. Add as much as you want to get it to a consistency you like... this makes a really delightfully creamy appeal to counter the spiciness.",
