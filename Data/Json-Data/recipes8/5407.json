My husband liked it but it's not his favorite. I would definitely make it again. I did use sweetened vanilla almond milk in place of regular milk because of eating dairy free and that's what I had on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I myself enjoyed it with earth balance butter flavored spread and honey yum!!!",
