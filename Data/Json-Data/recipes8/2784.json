I used regular flour tortillas and shredded cheddar because that's all I had in the house and they were still delicious. To make the tortillas more pliable, I gave them a steam bath by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and placing them in the microwave for a minute. To eliminate the open ends, don't place the filling in the middle, but close to the end toward you. Much like you would assemble an egg roll, start by folding the right and left sides inward and then roll forward while continuing to tuck in the sides as you go. The little bit of moisture from the microwave will also help seal them. Once rolled give them a good firm press and then thread your toothpicks. Yummy and thanks!",

I may try this again but first steam the corn tortillas before even attempting to roll them again. I ended up throwing away 1/2 a package of corn tortillas.:o( Attempted again this time I steamed the tortillas first so they would roll easier. However when I put them in the oil they stuck to the bottom & ripped apart. So I decided I could bake them instead so I steamed each tortilla sprayed the bottom of a glass baking dish with oil and sprayed the tops of the tortillas with oil as well. They came out just right and were very good. I placed some shredded cheddar cheese on top of them at the very end of baking time. I baked them about 10 minutes but didn t actually time it exactly. Served with tomatillo salsa & sour cream & Mexican rice.",

I love it because I can double the recipe and make a whole bunch at once and freeze the rest. Yes you do have to warm the shells before rolling. Hint for freezing: Freeze the taquitos BEFORE frying them. Then just fry them frozen. Don't need tooth picks for those and they stay together nicely.",

The only changes I made were instead of smoked I used Sharp cheddar with the swiss and I used green onions. The \"green\" Salsa I am assuming is salsa verde?? That is all I could find and I only used half because I didnt buy enough. It didnt matter much though. I had put the chicken it a crock with garlic and onion for a few hours till the meat was tender and fell apart. The filling was so delicious. I also didnt have peanut oil so just used canola....worked fine. Served it with Guacamole Sour Cream & Salsa. The taquitos I usually have have hardly any filling. I like to get as much in there as I can. It makes it harder to keep together when rolling and frying but is so much more flavorful when you are eating them.
