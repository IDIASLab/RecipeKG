UPDATE:  I made these again and refrigerated the dough for about 24 hours before I made the cookies. The dough was easier to handle after being in the frig- not as sticky. They also came out even better than the first time I made them...a bit of crispiness on the bottom and around the sides and soft inside.  The powdered sugar seemed to adhere better, too. Putting the dough in the frig was definitely a good idea.  These are our favorite!",

Let them turn just golden on the edges and they turn out great. I have also used this recipe ratio to create other kinds of cookies - basically any cake mix with 2 eggs and 1/3 c. oil and add whatever you like - chocolate tends to absorb more liquid so I add a couple tablespoons of chocolate sauce... Try the spice cake cookies at Christmas - YUM!! Much thanks to Lissa - this is a winner!",

This is a keeper recipe...have to keep the recipe..the cookies didn't last long. Loved the crisp outside and chewy center...but don't overbake! When you think they aren't done...they are.\r\n",

The most recent one I used for a crowd of teenage kids was chocolate cake mix, 2 tspns almond flavoring and CHERRY flavored cranberries.  WOW did they love these chewie cookies.  I called them Chocolate cherry chewies!",
