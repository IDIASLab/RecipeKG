Awesome recipe. Will definitely make again. Thanks so much!",

My husband prefers spicier foods and topped his with hot sauce; those seeking to feed a spice-loving crowd could season the meat with a little taco seasoning and use hot enchilada sauce and pepper jack cheese, with pico or hot salsa to top.  I liked it just fine as written, though; it was not bland.  It seems like an affordable, use-what-you-have-onhand kind of recipe, and is going to become comfort food in our house!",
