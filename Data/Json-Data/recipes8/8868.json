I also went to Whole Foods & got two 20oz.each packages of peeled & cubed butternut squash, it makes 10 servings in this recipe.  I used crystallized gourmet honey (I used \"Miele d'Fleur\", a product of Spain) & didn't puree completely...the flavor & texture were incredible! Now, it's a bit heavy so next time I'd go a little easier on the cream but all in all, such a fantastic recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Two things kept me from giving this recipe 5 stars: It was too salty, and the chicken stock should have been added in two parts. 1) I'm the salt queen. I put extra salt on everything! So when I say \"too salty,\" believe it! Next time I make this, I'll put 1 TEASPOON to start, then let others add what they want at serving time. 2) Adding 32 ounces of chicken stock before blending made for a dangerous situation. Even trying to hold down the top of the blender as instructed, the top shot off and hot soup flew everywhere (including on my hand)! If you have a handheld blender, use that to blend right in the pot. That worked really well for me. If you don't have a handheld, I would add about two cups of stock when cooking the squash/onion mixture, put that mixture into the blender when cooked, and add the rest of the chicken stock after you pour it back into the pot. Then simmer for a few more minutes before adding the cream. Keeping these two problems in mind, I will make this again! It really was delicious.",

However, I realized it was only 1lb 2oz, so I made 1/3 of the recipe. I added about 3-4 minutes onto the simmering time once I added the broth as they were big pieces. I then put it all in Vitamix blender and blended it on high about 3-4 additional minutes. Only change was I didn't have heavy cream so, I used 2% milk and 1 Tblsp of butter. It worked fine for last minute. This is very much like the butternut squash from the nice restaurants, except I liked that it was not loaded with cream and butter, and I know what went into it. I got 3 servings with 1/3 of the recipe, which was fine for dinner tonight. TY!",
