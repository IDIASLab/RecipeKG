The only thing I wish I would have done differently is not use the muffin tin liners, because they stuck badly to the paper.   (I got 15 muffins out of the recipe). This is a great recipe.  They are very moist (the chia seed gel?), without the graininess or slimyness of some gluten-free baked goods. Thank you for submitting it.",

I did however do a couple of changes because of my own personal preference and my experience with past gluten free recipes . I didn\u2019t add an egg because I had none , I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, the same amount of the recipe asked for but I think I\u2019ll more next time if I don\u2019t add the egg again , coconut oil adds so much moist to gluten free muffins. I also did not use any of sugar the recipe called for because I was using 4 real ripped bananas and I knew I was gonna add 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Sweetness was perfect , it tasted like banana bread . I will def make these again . It\u2019s a great recipe and def a keeper . Thank you for sharing",
