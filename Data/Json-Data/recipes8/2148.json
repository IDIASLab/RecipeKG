I learned to take a spoon and tap the outer side to release batter while spinning the Bundt pan. I go back and smooth the batter with the backside of a spoon covering every apple slice. Try to keep the cone side free of a lot of batter for easy release. I also combine vege oil and crisco to coat pan. Can\u2019t say enough about this recipe I love it.  Just be certain your apples are cut thin.  I used orange extract with water   Enjoy!",

                "reviewBody": "Ok, taste-wise this cake is phenomenal; I mean, it's crazy good! Perfectly sweet, plenty of apple flavor, and the cinnamon comes through surprisingly well too. The cake portion itself is also quite moist and light. No complaints on that end at all. Where I had trouble is with the apples. I used 4 smallish McIntosh apples, sliced really thin. This makes a lot of apple slices to layer in between the cake batter. I was worried that the apples would block the cake from baking into itself to make one cohesive cake--and I was right. The cake came apart at the apple layers, essentially making two separate cakes with apples. I was able to salvage it and stack it back together, but it looks a hot mess. I don't think I'd use less apples, because I like the flavor--but maybe I'd dice two of the apples and put them directly into the batter, then thinly slice the remaining two apples to create layers. Also, my cake batter wasn't very thick as the recipe described, even though I followed the recipe to a T (with the only exception being adding a 1/2 tsp of salt). So I rate this 4 stars, because the flavor is dead-on; but I would be wary about layering the apples too much. Thanks for the recipe though--this cake is delicious!",
