I cut the ends off the watermelon leaving the center flat on both sides, remove the rind to form an actual cake shaped watermelon and then decorate with other fruit using toothpicks to secure the pieces that need to stay in place.  For the leaves, flowers, stars or other shapes I use cookie cutters or just a paring knife. \n\nGreat alternative to a traditional cake and everybody raves about the look. It takes me about an hour to make, mostly cutting up all the fruit; putting it together is fun, easy and kid friendly. Any leftover fruit goes in a side bowl for fruit salad. My family always eats the bowl first saying the cake's too pretty to eat..",

A lot of fruit juice seeped from the fruit but fortunately the edges of the pie plate caught the excess fruit juice so I didn't have a big mess. I just \"drank away\" the excess juice with a straw. From now on when I make this recipe I will place the cake in my flan pan both to catch the juices and so I can stack up lots of fruit for garnish. Thank you InTheKitchen for sharing your recipe.",
