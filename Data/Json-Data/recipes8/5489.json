Nearly a half- century old and I'm learning to enjoy coffee. Looking for a way to ease off Starbucks and keep some $$ in my pocket, I began \"studying\" how to make coffee here in Allrecipes and YouTube (no joke). Now confident with making hot coffee, I was ready to step out into the cold brew coffee world and have some fun. I admit that I didn't follow the recipe exactly and took the liberty of making a few tweaks such as, 1) cold brewed Breakfast Blend coffee in Bodum French Press (12+hours), 2) drizzled the walls of the cup with caramel and dark chocolate sauce, 3) used non-dairy coconut creme and 4) coffee ice cubes. The coffee ice cubes ensured the last sip is as good as the first!!",
