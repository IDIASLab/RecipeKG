The mix was runny after following all of the directions with no changes. I then let it sit out for an hour hoping it would firm up, which it did, but still not to the right consistency. I ended up putting all of the mixture into a bowl and we just spooned it onto plates. It would be terrific over apples as a type of apple crisp too!",

We love this style of cookie anyway, but I'm convinced what I loved most about this particular version of it is the fact that it doesn't have SO MUCH runny chocolate areas. In fact these would be perfect made into truffle shapes and rolled in powdered sugar or coconut or cocoa powder etc. SO GOOD. I used the regular Country Crock tub stuff, I imagine the lower fat ones wouldn't work as well. The stick kind would probably work. Thanks so much for the recipe!
