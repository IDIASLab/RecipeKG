I used jarred pesto instead of making my own because my husband doesn't like walnuts.  I used my food processor on fresh spinach leaves, which made it blend really well with the pesto.  I liked the way the tomato sauce balanced out the pesto/spinach combo, although I thought the amount of spinach and pesto it called for was a little overpowering.  I added mushrooms and 1/2 lb of ground sausage and 1/2 lb of ground beef because my husband doesn't call it dinner unless it has meat.  I gave it 4 stars because of the overpowering taste of the pesto and the noodles on top got pretty tough.  I advise just skipping the last layer of noodles and putting the cheese on top of the last layer of pesto.  It was a nice change.  All in all though, I think I'm going back to my usual lasagna recipe.",
