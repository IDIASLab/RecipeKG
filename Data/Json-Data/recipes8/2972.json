It did get dry by the time I added the sweet potato mixture so I added some water every 4-5 minutes or so and that did the trick. I will definitely make again!

Corn would maybe be a better choice than carrots and leave out the sweet potatoes..because it already has regular potatoes for texture.

If you add tons of salsa avocado cheese hot sauce etc...then it drowns out the sweetness. Oh and the cook times I think are too generous.",
