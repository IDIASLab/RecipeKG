The step that mixes the sugar, banana, butter, eggs and vanilla creates too much liquid. The batter was very loose. My muffins were dark, flat and sunken in the middle. Taste was extremely sweet. I do not recommend and will not use this recipe again.",

(3/4 cups). Keep a separate 1/4 cup of small chopped nuts to top before putting them in the oven. \n\nFilled the first 12 cups 3/4 full of batter - that made the minis. Got another 12 cups which I filled just under the even level of the baking cup -came out a normal size muffin. My kid ate 3 muffins in under 5 mins. Great recipe!",
