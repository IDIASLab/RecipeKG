Used two large boneless breasts and kept the \u201cmarinate\u201d ingredients faithful to the recipe. Turned out very good and rice was a nice compliment to the chicken and buttery sauce. I doubt the refrigerator time in the \u201cmarinate\u201d changes the flavor much as the butter quickly solidifies preventing spices and flavors from penetrating the meat. I believe preparing the butter sauce, pouring it over the chicken in the baking dish and letting it sit for 15 min while the oven preheats would be just as flavorful. Also cutting large pieces of chicken into smaller pieces would allow the sauce to flavor more surfaces of the meat (might need to adjust cooking time).",
