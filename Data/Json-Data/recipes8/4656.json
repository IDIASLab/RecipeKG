In that case, these barbecued pork skewers come highly recommended. And no, we're not just sticking chunks of pork on a stick, this is way more advanced and way more delicious. Garnish with thinly sliced green onion and drizzle with extra barbecue sauce if you like.",

Easy to follow recipe. Bad news for our porky pals everywhere.  Thanks again, Chef John. I have yet to make one of your recipes and be less than satisfied.  And normally I'd be pretty chapped about this, Chef, but you've satisfied my girlie, too.  And I am okay as hell with that.",
