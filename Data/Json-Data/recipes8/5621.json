(Wet your hands when rolling balls, cause it's so sticky!)\" My daughter and I enjoyed making these together, and other than using 1/4 c. ground flax and 1/4 c. chia seeds instead of the full half cup of flax seeds, kept everything the same. Couldn't bring myself to roll them as large as golf balls b/c they pack a punch - energy, and crazy-filling. Ate one b4 jumping rope and added 10 min. onto my jam. Not to mention that they taste crazy delicious. I also used mini chocolate chips rather than regular size b/c I don't think the balls would've held together quite as well w/ the bigger chunks. Recipe doesn't specify to refrigerate or freeze which is my only complaint - wondering where and how long they keep ...",
