                "reviewBody": "10.22.20 The one thing this recipe does not tell you to do is core the brussels sprouts.  I took the submitter\u2019s suggestion and sliced the sprouts in my food processor which was indeed much easier than hand slicing small brussels sprouts.  The issue is that there\u2019s not enough time for the core to really cook, and as a result, you end up with little white core disks that are hard and  inedible.  We ended up pulling them out at the table which was a real pain.  My suggestion is if you want this to be successful, you should take the time to core each brussels sprout, which I know will make the prep time much longer than the 10 minutes listed.  On the positive side, these flavors really do mingle well and it\u2019s tasty, but the core issue is a big one.   IMO, if you don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re setting yourself up for a disappointment.  I\u2019ll try this again because I liked the flavor\u2026but NO cores.",
