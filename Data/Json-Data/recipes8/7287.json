Blending it makes it kind of frothy and mixes it well. Everything else I do the same except I put more bacon and I have never tried croutons in it. We call this salad Dragon Breath and it is a hit at parties. My friend gave me this recipe and she masters it every time. Enjoy",

I mixed it in the small blender to make it frothy. The heads of romaine I used were not overly large and this salad made 6 hearty servings. I served this with 'Broccoli Pizza Pie' from AR. My family very much enjoyed this salad and I won t hesitate to make it again with the dressing I used.",
