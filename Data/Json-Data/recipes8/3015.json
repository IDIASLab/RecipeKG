These flavors combined with the spice was absolutely delicious! Some variation... I used flour tortillas instead of corn. I did not use chicken broth. Instead of tomato sauce I used diced tomatoes with green chili (canned). And instead of using the chili spice and adding the other extra spices the recipe suggested I bought \"Texas Chili Mix and seasoning\" from Sprouts. It contains chili cumin paprika black pepper onion and salt. I did add the cilantro and lime. We kept it simple and chose not to add lettuce or salsa or anything else on top - it doesn't need it! I'm telling you... delicious!",
