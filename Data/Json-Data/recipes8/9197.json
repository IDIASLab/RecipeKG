No special equipment is required other than a double boiler, and if you don't have one, you can create one by using a bowl or smaller pot over a larger pot for the hot water. Just make sure the smaller bowl or pot doesn't touch the water as it bubbles. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer.",
