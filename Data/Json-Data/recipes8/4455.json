Becuase the only spice (apart from salt & pepper) is the cumin all the meats were enhanced without being overpowered -- nice! And the habanero provided just the right amount of kick. This dish was very popular when I served it tonight and went great with the garlic bread I made to sop up the broth. This recipe's definitely a keeper for me. Thanks!",
