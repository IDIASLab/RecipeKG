The only thing I'd do differently next time is to season the chicken with a bit of salt (and maybe some garlic powder too) in addition to the pepper. The bites that I had that were mostly chicken were a little bland which a few shakes of salt fixed. I served this over mashed cauliflower for the perfect low-carb/keto meal. I will definitely make this again!",
