I usually end up putting a red enchilada sauce (or tortilla chowder from trader joe's) on top, so they are a bit saucier. Without it they seem a bit dry, but overall they are great, and even my 3 young kids like them. Not as time consuming as they might seem, either.",

I made my salsa with 4 tomatoes (the grocery store didn't have tomatillos this week - hey it's Canada!) 1 medium onion 1 jalapeno pepper and 1/2 an avocado (delish!). Drain ALL the water before blending otherwise it'll turn out too runny. I also added more cumin and chili pepper to the potatoes (I'm a big fan of cumin). Instead of adding the potato mixture to an oiled pan I mixed the oil directly with the potatoes. I couldn't find corn tortillas so I used the flour variety instead. I had many compliments! But wathc out for the jalapeno pepper. Instead of blending directly into the tomato mixture blend it on its own and add slowly until obtaining the spice level you desire. Muy bien!",
