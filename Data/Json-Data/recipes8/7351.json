Instead of using the tobasco sauce, garlic powder, and paprika mix, I used a jar of HOOTERS hot wing sauce. I added some olive oil to it to keep it from burning and to coat the potatoes. Then baked them as the recipe states.  Also, not having time to thaw and cube chicken, I used a bag of Fajita chicken pieces, precooked and thawed.  It was perfect and took half the time.",

I followed the author's shortcut except that I used Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce.  I used red potatoes and left the skin on.  Instead of putting raw chicken in with the roasted potatoes, I sprinkled it with the paprika, garlic powder, and seasoning salt, then sauteed the chicken in olive oil until cooked.  I added about a half cup of wing sauce and 3 tbsp unsalted butter to the cooked chicken (this was for a half-recipe) and simmered for about 10 minutes before adding to the roasted potatoes.  Chives are a no-no for my hubby, unfortunately, but this was DELICIOUS anyway!  I should have made the full amount!  I'll be making it again in 2 days when friends come over to watch a football game, and will keep it warm in the slow cooker.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, MammaK!  :)",

But I did do my own version of this recipe (as I usually do!) I roasted the potatoes at the time & temp suggested but with just a drizzle of olive oil and some garlic salt and pepper. Then I had some chicken that I had precooked and shredded, so I tossed that on top then poured the wing sauce over top of everything and mixed together, topped with cheese and put back in the oven until everything was heated thru. For the wing sauce I used some of Franks wing sauce but to tone it down a little I added butter and garlic. Thought I'd share my own twist on this delicious recipe!",

I, like other reviewers, didn't like the idea of putting raw chicken on cooked potatoes, so I cooked the chicken on its own in butter with about 10 drops of hot sauce, garlic powder, and pepper.  When the chicken was done, I took the roasted potatoes out of the oven and mixed in about 1/4 cup of cheese.  I then topped it with the rest of the cheese, the cooked chicken, the bacon, and the green onions and baked it for another 10 minutes.  I served Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Chicken Dipping Sauce on the side.  Everyone loved it, and my heat sensitive seven year old gobbled up the chicken.  I thought the hot sauce gave the chicken a bit of a delicious bit, but he didn't notice.  This is a keeper!",

Made additional sauce for the chicken but added a few tbs of butter then added the chicken to soak up the flavors.  Started with a whole roasted chicken and cut it into bite size pieces after removing the skin.  This saved a step and I didn't like the idea of putting raw chicken on the potatoes.  After I took the completed dish out of the oven, added a fried egg to the top.  It added just the thing needed to take away any dryness.  Will definitely make this again.....but for brunch I think.",

Ok hmmmm i thought this was just ok i felt like it was missing something.I did roast my potatoes first used a regular baking dish those were my only changes.I love the concept of this recipe so its worth trying again with some tweaking. For a little extra kick i drizzled some ranch dressing over the top im thinking incorporate either ranch or creamcheese in the potatoes or try using so m e Velveeta i will update my review next time around...lol",
