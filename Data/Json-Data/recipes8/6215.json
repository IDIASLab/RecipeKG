Only you have to work fast because the caramel hardens and the salt wouldn't stick. I dipped all apples first then did the salt and the chocolate last but like I said the salt didn't stick and I kind of had to press the pieces into the caramel. These are even better tasting than the plain caramel apples. If you like the contrast of sweet/salty you'll like these. Thanks for the great idea!!! I had so much fun making these.",
