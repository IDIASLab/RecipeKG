I made this as written using the ingredients as listed but after saut\u00e9ing the veggies and adding other ingredients I baked these in the toaster oven. The flavor is very nice but different than what I'm used to as there is no brown sugar added. This is a recipe that I will be making again. Thank you Don for sharing!",
