I've made this recipe a half dozen times, so finally made up a pint jar with the spices (multiplied the spices by 10, combined, and stored in labeled mason jar).  I rewrote this recipe to be called \"Any Meat, Lotsa Beans, Chocolate Chili\" and have been handing it out with ziploc baggies of spices all over town, to rave reviews!  I throw in whatever meat, beans, and veggies I please, and the chili comes out delicious every time.  BEST THING ABOUT THIS RECIPE is that you can use left-over, cooked meat, canned beans, and just throw the spices in there and the whole thing is delicious IN ONLY 15 MINUTES!  I also use whatever tomato product I have on hand, and must add some sort of corn, either fresh, frozen, or canned.  Enjoy this recipe... You'll be making it often!",

The addition of the cocoa powder added an extra layer of flavors to the dish that you don't find often in most chilis. I would definitely make this again. My only critique and it is slight as this dish is pretty perfect as is is that I found the proportion between meat and beans to be too heavy on the beans side. Next time I would either increase the lamb by half a pound or decrease the amount of beans by a cup. If you're using canned kidney beans 4 cups is roughly 3 cans. Otherwise delicious!",

We actually raise our own lambs for eating so we have ground lamb availble in our freezer (sorry to those who couldn't find it it's so good with it!). I actually added 3 cans of diced tomatoes one with green peppers and onions and 2 cans regular rotel. Next time I will omit the crushed peppers as it was a little spicey for my kids but they still loved it and said that it was a 'good spicey'. Thanks for an awesome recipe!",
