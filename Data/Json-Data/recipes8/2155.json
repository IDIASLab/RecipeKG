        "description": "Some people describe pizza rustica as an Italian meat-filled quiche, but I think this traditional Easter recipe is way closer to a savory cheesecake filled with a massive amount of goodness. The light, flaky crust holds together an embarrassment of riches--sausage, smoked ham, salami, and pepperoni, plus ricotta, mozzarella, and Pecorino Romano cheeses. It's definitely not like pizza! Note: To be sure you have enough dough for the crust, you might want to double the dough recipe!",

I had never made my own pie dough before, and while I think I kinda messed up the crust a little, the rest of this recipe was fantastic. Mine didn't fully set in the middle and probably needed some more time. Even with all of these mistakes, it was fantastic. I will be making this again for sure.",

                "reviewBody": "Recipe turned out exactly as described and was fairly easy, if time consuming.  However, with all the meat, it was borderline too salty to eat.  I added spinach and put a bit less meat than specified.  I would make this again with far less meat and a lot of veggies... spinach was a nice addition.  I might add roasted red peppers, broccoli, green onions, etc.  The recipe calls for very little added salt, so all the salt is coming from your add-ins.  The crust was perfect and held together nicely... work great for a 9-inch non-stick springform pan.",
