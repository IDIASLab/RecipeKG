I felt the stacks needed a bit more flavor so I added minced garlic to the marinade and then sprinkled grated romano cheese inbetween each layer. (Also be sure to season everything with salt and pepper.) I chopped the mushroom stems leftover onion and eggplant and sauteed in olive oil with 4 cloves of minced garlic then added a can of diced tomatoes to make a quick pasta sauce. It simmered while the stacks cooked in the oven. I served the stacks with pasta and sauce; the entire meal was satisfying and delicious. I feel that this dish needs slightly higher heat or a longer cooking time especially if you cut your slices on the thicker side!",

I have also tried this casserole style - I made a simple sauce with the tomatoes and onions with some garlic and lots of fresh herbs-oregano basil and rosemary. Omitted the balsamic vinegar and instead poured the sauce over the eggplant and mushroom and topped with the cheese. This made a delicious and healthy vegetarian main course.
