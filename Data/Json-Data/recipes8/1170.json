I was surprised at just how buttery the cake part tasted with only having 1/4 cup melted butter in it (I was also surprised to see no egg in the recipe either). Regardless, the cake is delicious and has a wonderful texture. The only changes I made were to use 1 1/2 tsps cardamom (because I really love it) and to add 1/2 tsp salt. I baked this in a 9 inch springform pan, and it took 55 minutes to bake. So, I would definitely keep an eye on your bake time--as 40 minutes was not enough for my cake. Thank you for the recipe--this is a wonderful cake!",
