Had to play with icing a bit, bake them longer, and only made 20 VS 24 according to recipe. But these aren't faults of the recipe. We dropped choc chips and cinnamon chips in some. Left a few plain and not iced. Kids had a blast making and decorating. Something different than muffins and cupcakes. Will make again!",

Also, for the frosting I used half cocoa powder and half powdered sugar to make the frosting chocolate. Also, I saran wrapped some of them and froze them. When you thaw them out overnight they are perfect. I will definitely be making these again! Love them!",
