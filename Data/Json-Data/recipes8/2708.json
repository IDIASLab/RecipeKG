We used lavash bread (flat bread) b/c that's what we had on hand and I made it as a casserole - super easy and good! We are vegetarian - almost vegan(dh has high cholesterol)- and haven't been able to enjoy a casserole type dish for several years now. This is a great way to get that creamy cheesy type taste without all the fat that you usually find with cream soups and lots of cheese. Homemade enchilada sauce is easy to make and I think it added lots of good flavor that would have be lacking with store bought. We'll definitely make this again however we will add some seasoning to the veggies - taco seasoning perhaps or just salt pepper cumin like others have suggested. Thanks for the excellent recipe!",

I used 2 leeks 1 red pepper 1 green pepper and 3 large cloves of garlic because my kids don't like the ones named in the recipe. You could use any veggies that you like. I'm glad I read the reviews because blandness would of been a problem if I didn't add cayenne pepper chili powder and cumin along with the salt and pepper stated in the recipe. I sprinkled these seasonings on the veggies before roasting them. I used homemade mashed potatoes. Also this recipe calls for 8 oz. shredded cheddar but that is only enough cheese for 8 enchiladas. I would use 12 to 16 oz. of shredded cheddar. There is a lot of prep and mess when making this recipe but it is surely worth it!",
