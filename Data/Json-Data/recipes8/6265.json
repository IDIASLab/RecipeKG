I also used Fines Herbs and lemon pepper along with seasonings specified in the recipe. The honey butter gave a nice golden finish to the fish. The trick is to soak that cedar plank in water for at LEAST 3 hrs. In my case I soaked it overnight. My meat-grilling husband loved this recipe and told me to make sure and buy more fish. The flavor was superb. Thanks Trishie for sharing this on your blog!",
