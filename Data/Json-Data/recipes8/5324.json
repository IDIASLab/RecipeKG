I ordered some Coconut Aminos, a substitute for Worcestershire sauce, but they won't be in for a week.  So I cut the Worcestershire sauce in half.  I also used beef instead of bison because I'm on a budget.  So to reduce the fat, I simmered my sausage and beef in a separate pan!\n\nWe don't have to watch our sodium so the last change I made was I salted as I went.  I salted the vegetables, salted the meat, salted the spices, salted after I added the tomatoes. \n\nLastly, I doubled this recipe and it was PERFECT.  SO DELICIOUS.",

Paleo purists would not approve of Worcestershire sauce, but there are plenty of recipes out there to make your own.  Or live it up and just use it.  This is GREAT!  The only addition I made was to add about 1/2 cup of tomato juice and 1/2 cup of beef broth to make it a little more soupy (and to make it go a little further).  I also used just ground beef because that is what I had on hand.  Amazing recipe, you won't be disappointed!  Thanks for sharing with us!!",

I could not get ahold of a dried chipotle pepper so i just left it out; basically skipping the first step all together. When the dish was all done it whether because i did not add that one cup of water in there or because i'm not a very good cook it was way too much like a tomato meat sauce. So all i did was add two cups of brown rice and effectively made jambalaya! It turned out fantastic and the ratio was just about right. Although it was no longer strictly paleo it was still a very healthy dish especially if you want to load up on some carbs!",

Also red and yellow pepper is what I had on hand. It's amazingly flavorful even without the omitted ingredients.
