Many people use tomatoes because it is what they have in hand and in some regions or countries is difficult to find tomatillos. The flavor is amazing no matter if you use tomatoes or tomatillos. This is the first time I use the slow cooker for cooking  tinga and it came out pretty good. I cut the chicken into thick strips to shred the chicken easily. I don't really like a messy tinga so I thought this would help the texture and presentation of it and it did. I added 3  more tomatoes to the recipe as I thought the dish was going to be a little bit dry and  I suppose I was right because mine was perfectly moist. I added some salt at the end of the cooking process. We enjoyed it in tacos and tostadas. Yummy!",

These are super flavorful and I found myself wishing I hadn't cut the recipe in half. I won't make that mistake again! Next time I'll increase the chipotle by 50% or perhaps add a spoonful of the adobo sauce because we like spicy stuff and these are just mildly spicy. Thanks for a tasty healthy dinner Mazola!",

I could've added more chipotles but that would have added more heat. I do think in the future I would need to add something to liven it up without heating it up! A very nice solid base to dress up though and I liked what browning the chicken before throwing it in the crockpot brought to the party. Thanks Mazola!",
