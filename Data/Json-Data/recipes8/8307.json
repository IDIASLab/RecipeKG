Alterations can be made to the recipe by adding different types of vegetables or adding cheese to the topping. The recipe is based on the Indian style cooking and can be eaten as a dish (with or without adding other vegetables). You may omit some of the herbs, but make sure you keep the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, coriander, turmeric powder and chili!",
