I roasted my jalapeno beforehand since I was making salsa anyway and it gave the casserole a nice smoky taste. I usually roll mine but didn't since I followed the recipe. As a note: you don't HAVE to boil the chicken you can use any type of cooked chicken you like: grilled rotisserie leftover chicken whatever...don't limit yourself to following the directions to boiling from scratch...you potentially lose a lot of flavor. Play with it and enjoy. I also foiled my casserole (as this is what the recipe is) and baked it for 20 minutes since we don't like dried out cheese...we prefer a more gooey cheesy texture.",
