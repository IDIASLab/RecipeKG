I like my food spicy so I heaped in some extra seasonings. This recipe taught me that swai is a versatile and tasty fish and I keep finding it for a steal at my local store so I'm happy to add this to my rotation of midweek dinners! Thank you!",

They didn't get near cooked but cooking them longer would have gotten the peppers overcooked. I recommend cooking them a few minutes by themselves prior to adding the peppers. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.",
