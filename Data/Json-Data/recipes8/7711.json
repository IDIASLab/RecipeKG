                "reviewBody": "Quite tasty for how few ingredients it has! I'm thinking there is an error in the recipe because 1 cup each of the raisins and dressing is WAY too much. The sprouts would be swimming in dressing. Thankfully I had decided to use half the amounts and that was plenty. If I had to guess the quantity of Brussels sprouts should be doubled which would be more in line with the 8 servings. As it stands this only makes about 4 servings. I recommend adding in the bacon right before serving to keep it crisp unless soggy bacon doesn't bother you. I steamed the sprouts for 6 minutes since they were smaller in size and that was just right.",
