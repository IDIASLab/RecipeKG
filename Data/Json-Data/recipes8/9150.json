Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are quickly browned, then simmered with apples and onions in a flavorful liquid. Simply remove the apples and onions at the end, let the liquid reduce, add a little cream, and voila, there is a beautiful sauce! We enjoyed this recipe with white rice, steamed broccoli, and a crusty baguette.",
