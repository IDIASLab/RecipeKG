Second, we fold the top of the bag over just once and put one staple in the middle.  This allows steam to get out without the top popping open (pun intended).  The staple is so small we've never had any problems with sparking or whatever.  \nI've also experimented with adding in a fresh jalapano pepper or some chopped garlic so it is never blah.  \nOne last thing, get some popcorn salt, it is much finer than table salt and works so much better.  \nI can't imagine buying MW popcorn with all the additives plus costing $1 per bag or more!

I used 1/3 c. unpopped corn with no oil, and seasoned to taste with salt afterward. There were literally NO unpopped kernels, and none were burnt! The bag was in for about 3 minutes, and the tip about listening for 2 seconds between pops was great! I've always heard 5, and part of my corn usually burns.\n\nI am so excited about this! I will never buy store-bought micro-corn again. Really versatile, too; this could be seasoned up with anything!",

I use the butter flavored spray release and I got great seasonings through kernelseasons.com -they carry lots more then you will find at the grocery store.  enjoy!\n\ni have used this idea and turned it into a gift basket...i got cute lunch bags, a big bowl, seasonings and butter release spray and a bag or jar of popcorn.  i typed up the instructions and gave them all as gifts last year....now my whole office knows how to make it....  this is really a great recipe.  thanks again Acontorer!!!",

Lots of fiber, very filling, low fat (esp without the oil), made a ton, inexpensive, no chemicals or cardboard taste (like packaged micro popcorn), and no packaging in the landfill.  No downside to this recipe! Total bag = 6 WW points made according to recipe  \n",

UPDATE:  I made kettle corn.  I put 1/4 cup kernels, 1/2 tsp oil, 1 Tbs sugar.  Popped in brown bag until popping slowed.  There were hardly any kernels unpopped.  Added some sea salt to taste while hot.  YUM! Tastes just like the Kettle Corn you get at the fairs!(Definately think 1/4 cup kernels is perfect for my microwave and paper bags.",
