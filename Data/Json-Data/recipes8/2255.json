When I asked my boyfriend what he wanted as a second side dish, all he said was, 'something different.'  I decided to try a twist on the traditional fruit salad that I grew up eating, and it was a huge hit!  The best thing about this recipe is that most fruits are great with the dressing, so you can use your favorites or whatever is in season.",

Salt pulls the juice out of fruits and when an adequate amount of juice is released it makes a nice sauce without tasting salty. Also if you buy underripe fruit they wont be very juicy and you wont get a good balance of flavors. Hope this helps anyone else who considers trying this!",

I mean every week.  I originally made the salad for a Mexican themed Tapas night with his parents and a bunch of their friends and this salad was a big hit.  I made the sauce exactly as directed the first time but since I am a little more liberal with the honey and lime and cayenne and it's just as good (I measure mostly by eye and \"feel\"). I never do more salt as you can definitely taste it in the marinade. I do INSIST however that you make this the day before, it's sooo good that we almost never eat it same day.  My typical fruits: canteloupe, honeydew, pineapple (must have), mango, papaya.  I also tried strawberries the first time but I insist they get a little too mushy from the marinade and they soak up a bit too much marinade.  My other tip: big bite sizes pieces!  The first time I diced the pieces small to look more like a fruit salsa but they took on too much marinade and weren't as good. \"Chunky\" sizes make for the best fruit-marinade ratio. :)  Enjoy! This Mexican Fruit Salad is very good any way you slice it!",

I like the addition of the cayenne--it reminds me of Mexican candy (mango-flavored hard candy coated with chili powder and cayenne) and it's not too spicy at all. I added some honeydew for color and because salt complements melon perfectly. Next time I'll add mango as well (8/11/07). UPDATE: I eat fruit for breakfast every day and I've found I can make up a batch of this on Sundays and just keep adding fruit to it throughout the week (my favorite combo is cantaloupe honeydew mango and watermelon)--the juices combine with the dressing and the flavor lasts all week.",

I cut this down to a couple of servings and I used kosher salt and only a sprinkle of it and about 1/8 tsp (a really good sized pinch) of cayenne. I preferred the flavor this had with the pineapple and mango over the strawberries and grapes. I think maybe the tropical fruits are better suited for this dressing? If you don't like spice you probably won't like this. It wasn't spicy hot but had a little warmth to it. This is really similar to my favorite fruit topping of Trecha's brand chile powder for fruit so if you like that you'll like this salad. Thanks I liked this.",

I would also use a pinch or two of chile powder next time as it was slightly too hot. It has a nice balance of flavours sure to be a hit at brunch!
