So I went and asked - indeed they do have Mexican buttermilk sold right by the Mexican Crema (sour cream) so I bought two containers and a bunch of pepper and set off to make this. NOTE: I roasted the peppers of the BBQ and tossed into a freezer bag and put that in a metal bowl and covered with a towel until cool and then into the fridge over night. Those pepper were so easy to peel and seed! I was so excited! - Now back to the recipe. Next time I would make them reserving some of the sauce on the stove on warm - bake and then top with more warm sauce. They don't hold as well as I would like and this would give them a great freshen up. Thank you for a new recipe - I made this for the Faceless Frenzy July 2012.",
