Definitely get the eggs boiling and the bacon cooking and then start on the dressing. My husband loved the sweetness but I also think I would cut down on sugar. One warning: don't overcook. Whisk continuously just until the onions get tender. I went off to work on another dish and the oil separated and I ended up with a sticky dark brown caramel ball. Had to start over.",

This made a huge amount of salad more like a good 5-6 servings. Very good!!!",
