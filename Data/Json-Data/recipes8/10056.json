With a rich vanilla custard sitting atop a cinnamon-y shortbread crust and finished off with a fresh blueberry topping, it's sure to wow! This is also fantastic with a simple shortbread crust, so feel free to omit the cinnamon and cream of tartar from the crust, if desired. Make sure to allow for plenty of time for cooling!",
