The thought has never crossed my mind and it is genius!  The only reason I am giving this 4 instead of 5 is that spaghetti sauce does not come in 26 ounces. 24 ounces is a standard size jar. On that note, I bought two 24 ouncers, used 26 as the recipe calls for but then ended up adding a total of 30 ounces because it needed it and next time I'll use 32 ounces.",
