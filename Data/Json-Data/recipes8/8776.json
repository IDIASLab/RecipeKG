I wonder if reviewers who said it was as way too much liquid actually took the time to reduce it as instructed. I did that and the sauce was thickened slightly so that when I added the rest of the liquid and simmered again with the chicken it was the perfect amount. I used half the butter just to reduce the calories and served it with brown rice to soak up a little sauce which made the rice delicious. Defiantly not too much liquid and definitely a keeper. Can\u2019t wait to make it again with the sage. I used thighs as per the recipe but I think it would be just as good with breasts. Thanks!",

Since fresh herbs are not as potent as dried, I  doubled the amounts of sage and thyme to better infuse those flavors into the chicken and sauce.   I used Honeycrisp apples which held their shape well and crumbled the bacon. (recipe doesn\u2019t tell you what to do with the bacon).  The chicken was tender and juicy, and the pan sauce very, very tasty.",
