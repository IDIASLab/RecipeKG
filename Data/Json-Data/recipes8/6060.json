I used a shallow foil pan instead of making one and loosely covered for the first 10 min of grilling and then peaked up the corners of the cover the last 5-6 min. Delish! I used one small to medium head of cauliflower and also added some diced onion that I already had cut up for another recipe i was making. Yum! A few bites in, my husband (who also loved as is) suggested the thought to add some blue cheese crumbles next time the last minute or two of cooking! Buffalo Blue Cheese Grilled Cauliflower? Yes! \n\nEither way; this was a great, quick and easy side dish great to pair with burgers, brats or even chicken! I could also see this served as a fun appetizer (grilled cauliflower bites) served with some ranch or blue cheese dressing. Thank you for sharing this! Will absolutely make again and again!",
