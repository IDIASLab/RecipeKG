I even let the mixture sit in the fridge for 20 minutes to harden. but when I put the cookies in the oven they spread over the entire area of the pan and burned before they cooked properly. Okay so maybe my pan wasn't the best. So I tried it another two times. The same results. The only time it worked remotely was when I cooked it in a small cake dish and just cut them. Even with that the taste was mediocre at best. Maybe I did something wrong but from my experience I would not recommend this recipe.",
