Was VERY much like my favorite tikka masala I order from a high end restaurant.  LOVED this.  Instead of a cup of heavy cream, I did half cup of light coconut milk and half cup of cream.  It's not a thick  sauce, and even the best I've had isn't that--it's a nice gravy--pour over rice, serve with naan to soak it up.  Left overnight, the sauce was much thicker the next day.  DELISH and I'll do it again.  (I might do 6 hrs on WARM instead of on LOW, bc it was boiling about 3 hrs in--and you don't want to boil dairy [yogurt] or it separates and that indeed can cause it to be watery.  Also chicken gets REAL hard and dried REALLY fast in a slow cooker.)",
