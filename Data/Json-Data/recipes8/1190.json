                "reviewBody": "I have now made this three times. I live alone and do low-carb. First time I halved the recipe. Second time I made the full recipe and shared a few. Third time I made it all for myself and have frozen it. It's work-intensive but well worth it. Here's how I did it this time. Buy a small butternut squash. To bake peel with a veg peeler and slice it in half. Bake according to basic directions for butternut squash halves but for half the time. When you can easily cut it in small pieces do so. Next prepare your spinach. I have only made it with ham so chop whatever meat you want to use. I chopped about half a pound of sandwich meat the last time. Buy disposable muffin tins and spray with cooking spray. Layer in your squash meat spinach and cheese in the muffin tins and then whisk the eggs milk and seasonings. Pour over the spinach etc. and bake according to directions. I thaw ONE for 45 in microwave and flip thaw for another 25 seconds. It'll keep you going! I do this as a 2 or three day process. Bake squash and refrigerate for a up to two days then layer the spinach ham and squash in the muffin tins an pour the milk and egg mixture over. Bake as directed. Throw away those muffin tins no need to stress!",
