And for such a simple dish, it had a really complex flavor that knocked all our socks off!\nThe recipe is versatile enough to accommodate what you have on hand, or for your personal tastes.  I didn't have fish sauce, so I substituted with about a teaspoon of anchovy paste in 1/3 cup soy sauce.  The fresh jalapeno didn't appeal to me, so instead, I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes.  The key ingredients for the sauce are the soy/fish sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, garlic and ginger.  If you start there and add/subtract what you like/don't like, this will always be a hit.\nFor those of you who had trouble getting the sauce to thicken; this dish must be cooked on high heat for the entire cooking time in order to achieve the right caramelization on the chicken and to get the sauce to reduce.  I used the entire amount of water called for and my reduction took between 10-15 minutes.  The sauce will bubble and foam.  That's ok.  That's what you're looking for to get it to reduce.  Don't be afraid of how hard it boils.  Let it do what it do!!!\nDO NOT USE BREAST MEAT!  Boneless, skinless thighs can withstand the high temperatures required to make this dish.  Breast meat will dry out way before your sauce is properly reduced.\nFantastic with a side of steamed broccoli with a bit of the sauce drizzled over it.  YUM!!",

The chicken was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy, the 1/2 star I took off was because I found the recipe a bit too salty.  I'm sure this will probably vary depending on the brands of soy/fish sauce you use.  I would start light on both then add if needed.  I made half a recipe for my boyfriend and I with a side of sesame green beans and brown rice. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food as I only had 3 chicken thighs, but it was perfect, if not too much food.  I had no troubles with the liquid ratio, but I did have a big pan with not much meat (and a gas stove). I would tend to think that maybe the people who are having trouble may be overcrowding the pan.  All in all this is a wow-worthy recipe, definitely suitable for company. I'll be making this again!",
