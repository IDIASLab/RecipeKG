The second time I sweated the onions (in a tiny bit of olive oil) separately from the beef. When the beef was browned I drained the grease and patted it dry. Then I added the spice package (plus a lot of extra chili powder paprika and garlic powder plus some Worcestershire sauce) and gradually added water as the spices and meat cooked together. Most of the water cooked off and then the onions were added. From that point I followed the recipe with the addition of some srichacha (asian pepper paste) right at the end -- added a lovely kick. With those changes the recipe is a definite keeper for us.:)",

Make sure you drain the ground beef (I always do) before adding seasoning mix and putting in the crockpot or it will be runny and greasy.

I didn't add any water and it was the perfect thickness. It seemed a bit hot for my little guy's taste so I added a handful of brown sugar. I served it over pasta with cheese and onions on top.
