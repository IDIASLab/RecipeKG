I didnt have rosemary so I used thyme which my husband prefers anyway Also I added zucchini and roasted it with the potatoes in the oven instead of microwave also added a little onion (or shallots one time) a few cloves of garlic and a some red bell peppers all sauteed in the bacon grease before I added the potato and zucchini. BTW I added the enitire 16oz pack of bacon to balance with all the extra veggies. I think next time I'll add some mushrooms instead of zucchini!! One time I added crushed red pepper flakes the extra kick was great for the adults! Also tastes great with salsa and/or hot sauce as a topping!",
