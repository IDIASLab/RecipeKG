Breaded stuff just seems to do better that way for an overall even  crispy  breading. These were crunchy on the outside and super juicy on the inside. The buffalo flavor did seem to get a little lost so as written these would be perfect for those who don't like a lot of heat. I chose to add some heat by combining ranch dressing and extra hot sauce for dipping. These were excellent and I anticipate the leftovers to hold up well too.",
