I used a Le Creuset silicon bundt pan which is a little smaller than the listed 10 pan so I m sure that s why this happened (not the recipe s fault). We re not into too much sweetness these days so I just couldn t see adding 2 cups of sugar. I reduced that amount (personal taste here) and sub'd Truvia Baking Blend to cut back calories. Sweet enough for us and you still get a nice kick of tartness from the cranberries. The cake baked up very moist and the cranberries were evenly distributed throughout. I couldn t taste any orange flavor at all and that was a bit of a disappointment. In the future I ll add more orange zest perhaps even a little orange extract because a cranberry-orange combo is divine. This was EXTREMELY easy to make and that s definitely a plus for this recipe. Thanks for sharing we really enjoyed it.",
