I highly suggest this for an occasional treat or to accompany some beers, peers, and sports. I've developed this recipe from a combination of other recipes over time and out of practicality based on what was in my kitchen at the time of experiment. I purposely left out Worcestershire and other burger flavorings to keep it simple and not detract from the Thousand Island-like sauce. Serve with french fries or hash browns.",
