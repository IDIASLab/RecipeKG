Most of us make lemonade just out of lemon juice, but as you may know, the oils in the lemon peel contain a tremendous amount of flavor, and once you drink this, you won't want to go back to drinking it how you used to.",

This recipe took me a whole day to make(i left the peel in sugar for a full 12 hours) but it was definitely worth it. My grandma who dislikes Lemonade actually enjoyed it. I will say that in my opinion it may actually be a bit too sweet so next time im going to cut out 1/4 cup of the sugar. I also think this recipe would be perfect to experiment with adding bitters for a little extra complexity.",

That oleo saccharum in tandem with the fresh fruit flavor really makes for a heck of a summer beverage.\n\nI've since made a double batch, which was also amazing, and tried it with limes as well. You just can't go wrong with this recipe.\n\nProtip: be careful to not get much of the pith into the bowl when skinning the fruit. If you do and find the results to be bitter, let it sit in the fridge for a day or two; this will mellow out these notes significantly.\n\nFinally, Chef John, you've inspired a recipe of my own. I call it Italian Lemonade.",
