The recipe mentions the seasonings inside flavor the chicken but the only seasoning in the recipe is salt and pepper and it is just enough to flavor the vegetables and that is it. I made the filling as written but gave the outside a nice coating of rub and it needed it. Another thing I will mention is that the vegetables inside hardly get cooked at all by the time the chicken is done. I actually prefer my vegetables crunchy but if you don't, you will not care for this. With some minor tweaks, this has potential.",
