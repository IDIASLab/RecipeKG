I would add at least 1/2 a tsp of salt to the batter next time though, I think it needed it. The texture was perfect though. It makes a great snack cake as is, or the perfect base to put just about any type of frosting / topping on. Whipped cream was delicious. Powdered sugar would have been great too. Or some chocolate chips while it's still hot, then smear them a little while warm! YUMM!",
