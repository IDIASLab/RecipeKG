        "description": "Pomanders are one-of-a-kind, no-bake chocolate cookies. This recipe has been handed down from many generations in our family. As a tradition, Grandma has made Pomanders for us nearly every Christmas, but they are great year-round! The longer you let these no bake cookies set the better they taste. So, make them a few weeks before you plan to eat them, hide them from your family and friends, and have patience! Store in tight containers for two to three weeks to let the flavors fully cultivate and intensify. You can eat these right after they're made, but for best taste let them sit at least two weeks.",

Made these 10 days ago wondered if they would be as good as the reviews. Tasted the first one today and these are simpy amazing! I wish I'd made 3 x as much! I used Fiori di Sicilia from KAF- about 1/4 tsp. and 1 tsp vanilla. These things are simply amazing! Found some pretty gold metallic fancy sugar to roll in and they look like chocolate dusted with gold. Making more for New Year's TODAY!!! Don't wait to try these- they will be a new family favorite! Edit: After giving these on my Christmas cookie plates the consensus is that it's better to roll them in plain cocoa than any sugar- cocoa deepens the flavor and the texture is better. Still love these just with cocoa not sprinkles or sugar!",

She would make Pomanders every year just for me.:-) One variation from above is that she would crush the vanilla wafers until very fine. (She used a blender and crushed the cookies in small batches.) The same was done with pecans. Today I crush the ingredients as fine as I can with a food processor. One final note we rolled them in red or green colored sugar (red made them pomanders and the green for Christmas!) They were stored in one tin for each color. I now make them for grandnephews and nieces. They don't expect smooth creamy \"rum balls\" but rather those wonderful \"textured\" orange chocolate things! They know they are POMANDERS!

I have quadrupled the recipe I have so use 24 oz of Choc Chips and make a large batch. We also roll in red and green sugar and alternate them in the tin - looks very festive.
