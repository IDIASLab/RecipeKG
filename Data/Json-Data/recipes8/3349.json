'Mixed the chili powder with the 1/2c cheese; then, added to chicken so spice would be better distributed. 'Pureed the tomatillos, but other friends were left with some texture. I forgot to toast the tortillas, but still good! :o May use a slightly smaller dish next time. Thanks much! Oh, I made Habichuelas Guisadas & added cooked white rice. So good! :) Thanks to SuzyQ for her help with that! :) Update: Leftovers fit with some room to spare in a 9x5 loaf pan. 'Maybe next time, with a longer warm-up. :)  This is veryyy filling \u2014> 10-12 servings.",
