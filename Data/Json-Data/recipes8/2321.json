It is watery with not much flavor, and certainly not what one would expect from the title - therefore, two stars if prepared strictly sticking to the recipe.  I guess a good word for it might be \"wimpy.\" So I made it a second time, this time substituting strawberry yogurt for the milk, adding more watermelon than called for, and a handful of ice cubes.  Still thinner, of course, than what one would consider a milkshake, but much improved - very refreshing, not too sweet  and with a lot more flavor.  Four stars with the tinkering.",

I then added about 1 more cup of melon some crushed ice and blended again. I would have given this 3 stars but in all fairness to the recipe this watermelon did not have a lot of flavor and I think that affected the outcome of the shake. I don't think this ever will be what I consider a true milkshake (without maybe adding a scoop of ice cream??) but it's not bad and really is low in calories and fat (unlike most milkshakes).",

I would love to try it with frozen melon next time or add some yogurt and see if that makes it better. Also I added a splash of vanilla extract which gave it a bit of an \"ice cream\" flavor that my 3 kids liked. Come to think of it I might have to freeze a whole lot of watermelon chunks to get us through the winter if it means they'll drink this smoothie with breakfast to get them all additional servings of fruit and calcium!! I am most impressed that Picky Daughter just slurped her cup empty asked for seconds and asked if we can have it every day!!",
