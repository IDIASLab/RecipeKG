I only used jalapeno peppers only because I didn't have a habanero but next time I will add that also. With the addition of that pepper these are going to be HOT because they had a strong zip to them just with the jalapeno. I did add a bit more mayo than suggested and I think it made it too loose if you were going to pipe these through a tip. I will make these again they are nice change from the classic deviled egg recipe of my own. Thanks for sharing (:",

Of course it will taste bland if you leave out one of the key ingredients.  For those of us who love heat, I'm going to try adding another jalapeno next time just to kick it up a bit more.
