I used scant powdered ginger instead of fresh, about 6 lightly smashed big cloves of garlic, and a couple of shots of teriyaki marinade & a splash or 2 of dry sherry.  I skipped the last thickening step with cornstarch; my \"secret\" to thickening many slow cooked soups and sauces is to add some instant mashed potatoes.  It came out great, the mashed potato wasn't noticable at all.  Everyone Loved It!",

Just put all of the marinade right into the crock pot, mixed it (careful of splashing), added the breasts, and cooked on high for 2 hours. THen lowered it to \"low\" for one hour, added the pineapple, 15 minutes, and done. Added cornstarch - thickened right up. Don't be deceived - the recipe smells WAY too \"ginger-y\" but does not taste that way. IF I was going to go strictly on scent, I would have said \"this is going to be disgusting.\" When I tasted it, though, I was reminded that ginger is WAY more aromatic than it is gustatory, so it tastes very balanced.

                "reviewBody": "Wow this dish is fabulous. It reminds me of terriaki chicken but with a heavier garlic taste to it. I made it with just 3 chicken breasts because we didn't need any more than that. I made the full amount of sauce. I did brown my chicken in a frying pan sprayed with pam however I believe that next time I will skip this part as it seems unnecessary. The chicken turns a nice brown color from the sauce so it seems odd to try to brown it first as well. I also did not have fresh ginger so I substituted 1 tsp of ground ginger. I also did not have a can of pineapple tidbits. So I just put in one small can of pineapple juice I think it was about 6 oz. I also scooped out the little pieces of garlic before I put in my cornstarch mixture. I think that next time I will leave the garlic whole and that will make it easier to take out later. Of course this is just a personal preference not to have chunks of garlic in my sauce. That is all that I changed and it turned out great! I served it with white rice and put some of the sauce on the rice. My kids did not want to eat it at first but after they tasted it they said it was good. Thank you!!!",

I stuck to the recipe to the letter and mine did NOT look anything like the picture. I should have taken the advice of other reviewers to reduce cooking time. My chicken was dark dark brown. The sauce didn't thicken at all and so I had to pour it into a saucepan and boil it up - which sort of defeats my theory of using only the slow cooker for a meal. Anyways it was alright but as far as soy - ginger - garlic pineapple sauces go I have had better. Sorry won't make this again. Couple suggestions which might make this better: reduce soy sauce amounts substitute some chicken broth like another cook suggested use more ginger and honey...",

Instead I used a 1lb. package of chicken breasts and cut the recipe for the sauce in half (approx.) I only had to cook the chicken for about 2 hours since there was so little compared to the original recipe - which was nice becuase I could still make it after work and eat at a decent hour. I didn't even bother to thicken the sauce and I served it over white rice. SO flavorful - I'll be making this one on a regular basis.",
