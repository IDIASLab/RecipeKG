I first cut the tortilla into thin strips about 2\" long by 1/2 inch thick and fry the tortillas until they are crisp all the way through. Remove from pan, lightly salt and drain on paper towel. Then I add chopped onion and saute until soft, add the beaten eggs that have been lightly seasoned with garlic salt, then spread the fried tortilla strips over the eggs. You can now add salsa if you like or not. Once the eggs are set on the bottom, flip the eggs over small sections and cook until done. The tortilla strips should be softened and give the eggs an almost \"meaty\" taste. You may garnish with shredded cheese, sour cream and avacado slices. For meat-eaters you can add crumbled bacon as a garnish. Migas are a 5 star recipe and everybody that eats them, loves them.",

You can also sprinkle shredded cheese (your favorite or a good Manchego)to the top of everything OR serve it as is with a side of black beans and sliced avocado. Makes for a hearty brunch.
