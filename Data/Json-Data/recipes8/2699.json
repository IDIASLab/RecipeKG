Note also that I used my own spices (cumin, bit of oregano, chile powder) and that gave it a bit more flavor, perhaps.  Also- only cooked it uncovered for 5 minutes- not 15.  I further varied recipe by cutting up tortillas and mixing all together, adding another can of [pinto] beans, a larger can of green chiles, no garlic or jalepeno (kids!), and topping with the onions (leaving half the top no onion/olives for-sigh- the kids again).  I also generously greased my pan, spread some sauce around bottom, used the rest on top with listed amount of cheese and had no dry bits anywhere top or bottom.  Served the adults with lettuce, tomato and sour cream on top.  Excellent recipe- even scarfed up by my normally no Mexican food son.  This will absolutely be a staple one in my house.  Enjoy!",

We are slowly switching to vegetarian eating and have been sticking to \"real\" foods. Well this was wonderful!!! My kids ate it so easily. They did not even know it was vegetarian! Even my husband liked it. We kept the tempeh in (contrary to other ratings) and found it was really quite tasty with the tempeh in. The only thing that I did not like was that it says it serves 8 and it really doesn't. We are a family of 2 adults and 5 children(4 that eat) and it was too little of an amount. In fact it almost needed a little more filling to keep this dish in a 9x13....maybe it would be better suited for a 7x11? All in all a wonderful recipe!",

Following other reviewers' suggestions I soaked the tortillas in the enchilada sauce for about 10-15 minutes and substituted thawed veggie burger crumbles for the tempeh. I added some shredded cheese one 3 oz. can of sliced olives and some enchilada sauce to the first layer before topping with the second layer of tortillas. Though the 16-serving recipe calls for 4 cloves of garlic I used only 2. I also used only one 6 oz. can of sliced olives sprinkled over the top with the cheese. Next time I'll saute the onions first. The 16-serving recipe will easily feed 8 hungry people when served with a salad and some crusty bread. It's hearty filling and very tasty. I know I'll be making this recipe many many times!",

I used the tempeh and since it was finely crumbled I barely even noticed it was there. I also added a can of corn an anaheim chili a packet of taco seasoning and about 6oz. of salsa. I put half the cheese on after the first layer as someone suggested and used 4 tortillas ripping them to fit the pan instead of the 3 per layer. I'll probably saute the onions and peppers next time as they were kind of crunchy. I will be making this over and over!",
