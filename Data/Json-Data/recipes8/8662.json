I needed something that could cook itself in the slow cooker as I spent the afternoon at my daughter's swim meet. This was very tasty and everyone liked it. The only thing we will do next time is add a little \"kick\" with some cayenne curry paste or red pepper flakes. Super easy and tasty recipe!",
