They changed a couple of minor things, though, which I understand.  \n\nSteps 5 and 6 in the directions are a little different that I would do it too, thought it might work as described. However you do it, always keep the dough covered when not working it to keep it from drying. A very light dusting of flour (I just brush the sheets with a flour-covered hand) will keep the sheets from sticking to each other) The way I make the dough roll is just to roll all the dough through the machine til very thin, then one at a time, stretch the dough from one end, brushing with fat and rolling until I get to the end, then start the next piece, overlapping them just enough to keep the sheets together.  This way, the dough doesn't dry out. Either way, you should be able to stretch the dough to at least twice the width it was as a sheet after its last trip through the pasta machine.",

                "reviewBody": "I can buy sfogliatelle ricce from the Italian bakeries where I live, which are made like this recipe. I have to admit that I am not a fan of the baked ricotta filling after having tasted the American version of the sfogliatelle, the lobster tail at Mike's Pastry in Boston. I have searched high and low and cannot find a lobster tail locally, so I resorted to making my own and used this recipe for the dough. The difference between the traditional sfogliatelle ricce and the lobster tail is that the lobster tails are not filled and baked with the ricotta filling, but are instead filled and baked with pate a choux (eclair paste)in order to expand and elongate their shape, which will resemble a lobster's tail. Then, after they cool, they are injected with a creamy filling that is basically diplomat cream (pastry cream mixed with whipped cream). \nI can vouch for the quality of the dough in this recipe, but I did not use the ricotta filling, so I cannot comment on that. I definitely had to add more water, even more than the recommended 2 teaspoons to get the correct consistency. After forming the shells, I filled them with choux paste and baked at 425 F for 10 minutes and at 375 for 10 more minutes. The choux paste forms a hollow cavity that can be filled with anything you desire. I do recommend the diplomat cream, but would try others in the future, such as sweetened mascarpone and whipped cream with chocolate and cherries; a chocolate diplomat cream; or a hazelnut cream.",

                "reviewBody": "YEAH! This is exactly the kind of complicated, multi-step, can't-find-locally kind of recipe I totally geek out on. First off, this was really fun to make. When I sliced into the dough log after it chilled, I exclaimed, \"COOL!\" because it looked like a big fat leek, with all the dough layers visible. I used homemade candied orange peel--with a recipe this fancy, why go halfway? I also don't think I stretched the dough enough after rolling it through the pasta machine. Oh: and rather than rolling the dough immediately after mixing it in the Kitchenaid, I wrapped it in plastic and let it sit on the counter while I made the filling. I did use the extra 2 teaspoons of water and the dough was still very tight; I wanted to give the flour time to absorb the moisture. When I did roll it out, it had a lovely, plastic texture. Like I said, my dough wasn't thin enough because the pastries were very, very crunchy--like the edge of the lasagna noodle that sticks up and gets dried out during baking. It wasn't unpleasant--but I wanted it to be thinner, more tender, like phyllo or strudel pastry. While I should probably just make the recipe again and see what happens, I also think I'd like to try adding just an ounce of fat to the dough to make it more extensible and tender. I didn't use all of the butter-lard mixture, and I some filling left over, which I froze and plan to use in breakfast pastries or for a yeasted coffeecake or something. Thanks for this great-tasting project!",

If I had to be critical I might use less vanilla and cinnamon only because i am trying to replicate Libby's in new haven. Dough is easy to make and filling also. I used a blender for the filling and mine might have been too smooth. The rolling of the dough takes some getting used to cause mine kept ripping but it didn't seem to matter. Most important is trying to keep your roll nice and tight so when you cut it the layers won't separate. I watched many YouTube videos before attempting and I would suggest the same. Some are in Italian but all you need to see is the technique for rolling. Also the shaping of the cone takes some practice but once you get one right you'll have it down. Avoid flattening the disc like I saw some videos do you really need a cone shape to have the clam shell shape. Making the candied orange peel was time consuming. Do it the night or even weeks before to save time. Took all day but I've always wanted to make them!",

Used my Atlas hand cranked pasta maker down the second thinnest setting. Dough was very easy to work with. Nice crispy crunch as they should have. I make these once a year and always worth the effort.",

Fine grating works fine;-) If I were to suggest two improvements indicate the salt measures (at least) in tsp. My salter doesn't measure well at low weights. Also I couldn't initially grasp how to roll the dough but your comment is VERY helpful.",

Converting everything to metric to get proper weights was time consuming but totally worth it! Now onto the filling. It tastes absolutely amazing but I wish that was by weight as well. It didnt stand up as much as previous batches and I think that's because the ricotta is too much at the state after it's been food processed. I used the amount measured after processing when I should have used that amount prior.",
