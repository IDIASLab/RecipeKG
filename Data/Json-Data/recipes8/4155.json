        "description": "Struffoli is a Neapolitan dessert that is traditionally prepared at Christmas and made of tiny dough balls that have been deep-fried and soaked in honey, then piled high on plates and trays. Some like to form them in the shape of Christmas trees or wreaths, always festively covered with multi-colored candy sprinkles. People who grew up with this traditional Christmas treat go out of their way to make sure there is a struffoli on the holiday table.",
