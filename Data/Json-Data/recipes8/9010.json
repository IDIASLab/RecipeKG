I've ALWAYS made my turkey this way and it always turns out great.  And besides, you get LOTS of wide eyed looks!  The idea behind the cola is that the acid in the soda helps to tenderize the bird, the sugar and caramel gives it just a hint of sweetness, and the coloring helps to give the bird a beautiful roasted color.  Enjoy!!",
