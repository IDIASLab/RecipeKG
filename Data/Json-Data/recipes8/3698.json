I marinated this for 8 hours so I wanted to concentrate the marinade -leave out the water there's no purpose for it, add more of one of the liquids if it's too thick. I used boneless chicken that I pounded down to 1/2 inch.  I used olive oil vs. sesame and dijon vs. honey mustard.  I also used 2 tsp. of liquid smoke and because I didn't use water I used 2 Tbsp. of orange juice vs. orange zest.  I also didn't have fines herbs so I used a combination of parsley, tarragon and marjoram.  The brown sugar made everything carmelize on the grill and the result was a moist sweet, yet smoky herbed chicken breast. I didn't even use the rosemary that I had as I had forgotten all about it.  Simply delicious and one to make for guests!",

I put the chicken and marinade in a gallon size plastic bag in a tupperware dish and turned it over every 6 hours or so to keep it marinaded evenly. I used the rotisserie on our Weber grill cooked it at 375F for 1.75 hours and it turned out great! I put big chunks of garlic under the skin of the chicken and also in the cavity before grilling and this made it more flavorful. Our whole family loved it and we will be using this recipe again for sure.",

Since I have a gas bbq and thus no coals I placed the chicken on the grill and then placed several springs of rosemary over the chicken as it cooked. This worked well. The chicken was very moist and flavorful and everybody loved it. I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the number and cost of all these ingredients. It wouldn't be a marinade I'd want to use all the time but will definitely make every now and then.",
