I never would have thought to make these myself one of the reasons I love this site so much. They were easy for the kids to handle and dip in the chocolate themselves which is great because when you've 'made' it yourself it tastes so much better! We dipped then rolled in chopped peanuts. One tip: take the bananas out of the freezer only one or two at a time to dip. The dipping rolling (and reheating of the chocolate halfway through) process takes just enough time that half of our bananas had become soft and wet on the outside which meant the chocolate kept sliding off when we went to dip them. Thanks for giving us a fun and nutritious snack recipe for the kids!",

                "reviewBody": "Gotta say I had some major ISSUES when I first tried out this recipes...I went through TWO bags of chocolate chips and they all BURNT. Yes you can burn chocolate haha. But after finding some easy fix tips this recipe turned out AMAZING. First off DO NOT try to melt you chocolate in 30 second intervals- ten secodns intervals is recomended if youre going to use the microwave. Its a pain to stop and go for that long but I promise you you wont burn your chocolate like I did. Secondly you can use a double boiler basically find a pot or soemthing that can withsand boiling water heat and place it ON TOP of your pot of your boiling water- youll have a consistent heart source so your chocolate wont harden as quickly and you dont have to worry about it melting (I highly recomend using the double boiler method!). Last tip! If you find that your chocolate is still hard and isnt having a \"melty shine\" to it (basically its not very liquidy) slowly add canola oil - about a table spoon each you feel like you need it-to the mixture as you stir. It loosens up the chocolate and makes it much easier to work with and you get the right texture for the chocolate; this works if youre melting your chocolate on a double boiler or in the microwave- add the canaola oil every ten seconds interval for microwaves and whenever you feel lik you need it on the oven. Did a batch of white chocolate bananas and they were DIVINE.",
