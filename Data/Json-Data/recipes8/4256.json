I like the flavor of jerk but not w/the cinnamon/nutmeg thing. I left out the cinnamon on this one. If you think this is \"dry\", this is basically a \"dry rub\" for your meat. If you want something different you need to try a jerk paste.  Toss a medium onion in a processor and then add the rest of the ingredients. Throw in some habenero or jalapeno to! :)",
