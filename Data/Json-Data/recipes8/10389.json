        "description": "Dense, buttery shortbread crust and a delicately spiced filling make these pear pie bars absolutely irresistible. And once you see how easy they are to make and to serve, chances are, you'll pick them over traditional pie every time. You'll find yourself with more salted caramel sauce than you need for the bars, but you can spoon the rest over top of anything from ice cream to waffles. Just store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge (and heat the leftovers before using). Sprinkle with flaky sea salt, as desired.",
