I have tweaked it a bit: I add parmesan and mozzarella in with the cottage cheese mixture. I also add minced garlic and some dried spinach dip seasoning (from Tastefully Simple) and it really adds some zing. I'm not a huge fan of poultry seasoning so I cut that down just a bit and since no one in my family likes mushrooms I use some other variety of cream soup- typically cream of celery- and it turns out great. I also use italian seasoned bread crumbs and I add parmesan cheese to those as well- I figure one can never have too much cheese! When you remove from the oven let it rest a few minutes so the inside sets up a bit more- you'll avoid losing the inside when you cut it.",
