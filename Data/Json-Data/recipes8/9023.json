Nobody was more shocked than I was to see how gorgeous, moist and flavorful it turned out, considering how very few ingredients and work was involved. Yes, the name is a double-entendre (there was a theme to my first Thanksgiving dinner!) I used a semi-sweet red wine, but you can go with whatever vintage you prefer if you want something more bitter. The drippings from the pan are practically a gravy on their own.",
