So the second time while I had my kielbasa boiling I threw my kraut in a pan with some onion soup mix and boiled it down some as well to make it more tender to the bite. I didn't try it at all with the mozerella, my taste buds instantly told me sharp cheddar and it was fantastic! I enjoy this recipe because my 7 year old refuses to even try sauerkraut, and I can pick and choose which keilbasa gets kraut on them. My 7 tear old gets just taters and cheese on his. I also found it to be better with a little salt and black pepper sprinkled on top ... but that's just my own preference. Super easy to make, a winner all the way with the ability to leave off things not liked for the picky eaters. The onion soup mix in the kraut while the kielbasa's boiling though did make a huge difference and gave it even more flavor!",

I figured that the girls and I would eat most of the fish and Drew boy would eat his meat, being that he's a big carnivor. Well, not only did the girls eat the fish, but they both DEVOURED the kielbasa too! I was shocked because even though my kids are not picky and would probably eat kitty litter if I gave it to them, (kidding) they are not sauerkraut lovers. Kids and Drew all asked to keep this in mind for future dinners as it reminded them of our yearly Oktoberfest dinners at our German club. Thanks Theresa!",

It makes the mashed potatoes taste waaaay better!  Put the sugar, sauerkraut and some water (to keep it from burning) in a pan and simmer it forever.  The more you cook it the better it gets!

Boiled the kielbasa and then stuffed it with the cabbage and mashed potatoes and baked it. Served it with mustard on the side. It is a keeper - I now know what to do with the cabbage leftovers. I can imagine that it tastes great your way too. Thanks Theresa.",

I cut up the sausage into bite size pieces and placed in a layer on top and sprinkled with the remaining cheese.
