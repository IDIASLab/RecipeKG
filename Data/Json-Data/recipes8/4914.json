The bruschetta topping is wonderful and just made these burgers perfect in every way! I served these on 'Soft Onion Sandwich Rolls' also from this site. I will def be making these again and again!

My hubby does not eat bread so we did this instead; followed the recipe and as the 'shrooms were grilling we grilled 2 Turkey Burger patties as well (seasoned to taste). After heating the 'shrooms and topping we laid the burgers on top then added the cheese we used shredded Cheddar/Jack as we are not horseradish fans. Had to cook up another batch as hubby ate his before I could get salad to the table it smelled so good he couldn't wait! We didn't miss the bread at all. Thanks for another way to fix up our favorite 'shroom.",

I love horseradish but the flavors didn't work for me. I think asiago or mozzarella would be much better for this and will use that next time. I also think it would be much better without the bun. Just serve the mushroom filled with the delicious tomato basil salad and top with a delicious Italian cheese pair it with a side salad. Yummmmm My husband said he would like it much better with a 1/4lb burger under the mushroom and all the goodies haha",

I had some nice mozzarella cheese and used that instead of the Parmesan since my boys were eating with us and don't like Parmesan but we did put a bit on ours along with the Mozzarella. My basil and tomatoes were fresh from the garden and we added some onion slices. Unfortunately we did not have the optional mustard topping so made my own topping. We served on rye bread since that is all we had. These are very filling you'll be surprised how one burger will fill you to the gills. Great dinner for a hot summer night.",

I made a few changes - we do not have a grill so I cooked on the stove at medium to low heat for the same time recommended in the recipe and brushed the top of the mushroom with olive oil. I did not use fresh basil but that didn't seem to make a huge difference. Lastly I toasted the bun which I think really added to the burger. I still can't get over how good this was...may be my new favorite meal!!",
