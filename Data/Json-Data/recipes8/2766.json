I marinate the fish in lime and a bit of jalapenos to add flavor, and just dust with chili powder and salt before grilling.  They come out moist and tasty, and best of all healthier!  I also suggest using cabbage slaw mixture instead of just straight cabbage.  It adds color and flavor as well.  The sauce is amazing as is though.  None of the flavors are too overpowering, and it's so tangy on the fish, a perfect combination!",

After you've prepped the chipotle with some of the juice, add some olive oil, and use the rest to marinade the fish. I George Forman'ed the fish, but fry pan or baking/broiling would work too. If you have fast fingers, and you want to make it easier, cut the fillets after frying.\n* If your palate is sensitive to spicy, drop the jalapeno. If jalapeno is too sour for you, replace with smaller(!) amount of habanero.\n* If you have a vegetable/fruit juicer, it cuts down on the prep time of the lime and jalapeno/habanero.\n* Side this with avacado or guac.\n* Side this with (easy) beans and rice. Remove 1/3 cup of water before boiling. When adding brown rice, throw in a can of black beans. Do this before cooking the fish, since brown rice takes about 25-30 minutes to soak up the water. Some people subtract more water and also throw in a can of stewed tomatoes. I like to add garlic powder.\n* Heat up the corn tortillas before serving. If you don't have a tortilla warmer, then make sure you fold in half before they cool.\n* Capers are just a garnish, don't worry if you can't find any.\n* If you are opposed to beer, use ginger ale.\n* If you don't have cod, any white fish will do. Some people have had success with salmon.\n* If cutting cabbage is a pain for you, use a package of mix and serve cole slaw, tossing the cole slaw packet.\n* Add cilantro and/or pink onion as a garnish or into the cabbage.",

It's such a simple recipe, but it's so light and crispy and scrumptious. The white sauce was very, very good...hmm, I'm sorry, I meant to say excellent! I used sourcream instead of yogart. I was leery of the capers..because I don't like them, so I minced the heck out of them so they would just kinda get lost in the sauce and provide flavor. I used 1/2 of the cayenne pepper, because that would be just too hot for my kids, and it had plenty of kick, and my kids still complained. I made a double batch of the white sauce, and I am so glad I did, because we lapped up just about ever bit I made. I also made up some fresh Pico De Gallo..it's simple to make and you can find that recipe everywhere on line. It added such a freshness to this meal. It was nice to make something for dinner tonight that I didn't open a jar or some pre made thing. I prepared everthing from scratch except for the corn tortillas. I used the corn tortillas and soft fried them..they were perfect. OH MY GOD, I can't wait to make these again. Be sure to make the sauce ahead of time so it will have time for all those ingredients to blend. I gave it 8 hours, but at least 2 would be sufficient.Try this recipe, it is worth the time and effort, and the batter would be terrific in many other types of things to fry.",

As some reviewers suggested, I used fresh, minced cilantro instead of oregano and fresh minced dill.  Instead of frying, I coated the cod w/ olive oil, lime, s&p and grilled it.  Right before I took the fish off the grill, I put the corn tortillas directly on the grill and only slightly toasted them on each side.  This definitely cuts any frying to make this a more diet friendly recipe. Great for casual outdoor dining.",

I only used maybe a teaspoon of sauce on each taco and it was very good. Also made some guac and put on the tacos. Good stuff.",

The contrast in textures also made this a perfect meal.  the crunchy battered fish with the soft tortillas and the cooling sauce...a masterpiece on the tongue.  Do not forget to serve this with a cold beer.\r\nAlso, my only criticism of this recipe was that the batter lacked \"punch\".  We added a few dashes of salt to the fish immediately after being taken out of the fryer, it made a huge difference.  We also served the tacos w/ a homemade salsa which was good, but probably not essential. \r\nOverall, this is a rockin' taco...I'll definitley make these again.",
