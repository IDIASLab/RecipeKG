A couple of warnings however: this is not a \"mushroomy\" sauce despite all the mushrooms and you'll wind up with way more sauce than pasta if you follow this recipe exactly. Instead I found this better as a recipe for a sauce that can be served over your pasta of choice. The asparagus flavor is quite strong but I didn't find that it overpowered the mushrooms but rather complemented it. Canned asparagus and fresh asparagus have quite different flavors and if you don't like the flavor of canned go with fresh. Cooking it until it's very limp (similar to the texture of canned) will allow for easier blending. If you do use canned do yourself a favor and buy quality stuff not the cheap canned stalks&ends. My suggestions for improvement; onion and garlic fried up with the mushrooms dice the mushroom instead of slicing don't fry the peas and mix the whole lot together and let it simmer for a little while so the flavors can marry. I also found that I didn't need any seasonings beyond a little salt.",
