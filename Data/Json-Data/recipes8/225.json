I didn't know if I was supposed to drain the syrup from the strawberry mixture; I just dumped the whole strawberries/sugar mixture into the cake mix. I think it probably would have tasted better if I had done the former. The fruit pieces gave my cupcakes a yucky slimy texture inside. Also I didn't know what I was doing with the frosting. I couldn't get the cream cheese to mix well in the frosting! It just chunked up and wouldn't smoothen out. Plus the frosting had a strange  flavor; just very sugary overall and didn't taste of vanilla from the extract or creamy and smooth like it was supposed to. I don't doubt this may be a great recipe; just my skills really.",
