This is not supposed to be a \"sticky rice\" like Puerto Rican or Chinese rice, but that's what you'll get if you don't saute it first.  I don't agree that you should brown it.... it should turn translucent, but not brown.  If you are adding fresh garlic, add it after sauteing the rice and only cook it long enough for it to release it's aroma..don't brown it-it will turn bitter. After you add the liquid, bring the rice to a full, rolling boil before turning it down to low and putting the lid on. Also, make sure you have a tight fitting lid...cover it with foil to make it tighter if necessary.  Don't peek while the rice it cooking!  After 20 minutes move it off the heat and let it \"rest\" another 5 minutes. If you do these things you will have purfect rice! Even though I ususally use homemade salsa, I think the Pace \"Make Mine Medium\" gives the right amount of heat and flavor to the dish.  Thanks for a great recipe that everyone can  master and enjoy!",

I like using salsa more than diced tomatoes b/c it has more flavor and spice ...and it doesn't taste like you just dumped salsa in it like I expected.  This is only for my family of 4, so I use 3/4C of uncooked rice, definitely a little more than half a tablespoon of olive oil (full recipe calls for too much), with 3/4 of the can of chicken broth (approx 1 1/2C), BUT still use 1C of salsa as I feel it's necessary, as well as a few dashes of pepper.   I only brown rice a few minutes longer after it's turned WHITE (very apparent white color).  Being Asian myself, I could cook rice w/my eyes closed it seems.  lol  Many times we don't add onions b/c I'm too lazy to dice them.  If we do, it definitely needs more than suggested or it's pointless adding. It's even better when you add diced green & red peppers to the rice you are browning or use green onion instead of white/red.  We eat the rice every time we make \"Whit's Chicken Enchiladas\" which is SUPER EASY and YUMMY! This takes less time than indicated for the rice to be done.  Also great to put in baking dish, add cheese, and bake at 350 until it melts! :)",

I then just added garlic and onion powder to it, spread it in a 9x13 baking pan and sprinkled mexican blend cheese over the top and put in the oven for about 15 min till the cheese was melted.  this was sooo good and sooo easy to make!

And as with alot of recipes when you brown or toast the rice first then you add the liquid.  It doesn't have to be hot liquid and then adding the rice.  I just get really annoyed when people change up recipes and then low star it It ridiculous.  Great recipe",
