I added fresh garlic and mushrooms (sauteed in a bit of olive oil) to the sauce just because those are 2 things that are vital to spaghetti sauce in this house! The sauce was very simple but really tasty. The only thing I had a problem with were the meatballs... I think next time I will cut the seasoning in half as the italian seasoning was overwhelming; it kinda ruined the flavor of the meatballs for me. That being said the meatballs had the BEST texture and consistency. Thank you very much CookingDiva!",

Anyway,back to the meatballs not only was it an easy recipe to follow,but the meatballs were really good. You would think my 14 year old was NYC food critic with the way he comments about my food,but he told my husband that he liked these so much he was speechless for once. Great recipe I'm becoming more confident with every meal I cook because if this website.",

They were very filling and much better than beef meatballs! \n\nThe only change I have made (after making this several times, it's such a hit!) was adding sauteed onion, green pepper, and garlic, and putting more seasoning in the sauce.

I also baked my meatballs instead of pan frying which saves fat and calories. Added some dry red wine to the sauce as well. Nice dinner...thanks!",

I test fry a mini meatball before cooking and add seasoning accordingly before shaping the balls. I bake in a 375 oven for about 30 minutes, easier than panfrying. The sauce recipe is great too, although i tweak it. I saute some onions and garlic in basil olive oil before adding canned tomatoes ( i usually buy the garlic and oregano seasoned, the more flavor the better!) and add more seasoning (I use a spicy italian herb grinder) and red pepper flakes (we like it spicy!). I let it simmer for a long time (an hour or so) to let the flavors meld. So good, we make this about once a week, and any leftovers are even better the next day!",
