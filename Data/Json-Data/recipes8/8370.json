While it does take a little prep work, the good thing is that it can all be done ahead of time.  The submitter of this recipe meant for it to be used with hot Jimmy Dean sausage, and I would agree since I used up the last I had from another recipe since I had to add some heat with chipotle seasoning.  And to my surprise we discovered that we are not fans of the puffed pastry.  Maybe my oven needs to be check again for the temperature because they seemed to be cooked fast on the outside but not in the middle.  I will serve the remaining gravy over toast with eggs for our lunch tomorrow.  Thanks, Lela!  We really enjoyed this !",
