You could serve this as a side dish, but with a hunk of crusty bread and a glass of wine, I'm not sure what else you'd need. Top with more parsley before serving.",

After eating, I somewhat disagree with C.J.'s julienne advice.  Vegetables, meat, & cheese were too small to really taste well.  Ratio seems a little too scaled toward the pasta also.  I took leftovers today & added more meat, cheese, veggies, and cut into a \"larger\" julienne.  Ratio was perfect then.  Also made a full recipe of dressing the first night, but used 1/2  Pasta absorbed all of it while refrigerating, so I drizzled in some more when adding the tomatoes.   Would suggest cutting meat, etc. a little larger than recommended; cutting recipe in half; but reducing pasta even further, to 5-6 oz. uncooked; and making 3/4 \"whole\" recipe of dressing, but saving out a little & adding it with tomatoes, or serving it on the side.  Otherwise, VERY good recipe.  P.S. You won't regret the anchovy!",

I think this is the kind of salad where the ingredients are pretty lenient (e.g., I didn't have green olives, so I subbed kalamata; I ran out of salami, but added a bit more ham, etc. ), but the technique is spot-on.  Julienne is the way to go.  Great recipe, Chef John!",

I made very slight modifications to the dressing just because I know my family\u2019s preferences in regards to vinegar: I used half the recommended amount of vinegar and used balsamic instead of red wine, and completed the balance of volume with a balsamic glaze. We prefer the touch of sweetness - but again, this is just personal preference. One family member skipped cheese altogether, one used Fontina instead of Emmental - it really works with any variation you like. I hate artichokes but love olives, my kid skipped the jalape\u00f1o. \n\nIt is such a versatile recipe and delicious during these hot days. Also the dressing is good enough to just eat with a spoon:-) the quantity of pasta given makes a huge amount. I halved it and still had 4 very generous portions, so consider the size of your party and their appetite before making. We used both mild and spicy Genoa salami and it was excellent, but I can see this working with coppa or prosciutto or whatever you like in the way of cold meats.\n\nAnother winner from Chef John, this goes into permanent rotation.

                "reviewBody": "Wasn't sure how to give this 3.5 stars, but all things considered, that's where this would fall.  To be sure, once prepared and fully chilled, this is a delicious salad and paired with a crusty bread - focaccia, french loaf, or even a great sourdough, this is a meal unto itself.  The dressing is very, very good and would be wonderful with any antipasto salad, or green salad, for that matter.  So flavor saved this one; however, a few negatives brought the rating down.  The recipe prep time is so far off that I wondered how anyone could have done the prep work in 30 minutes!!!  If you have a sous chef who places everything on the counter, weighed and cut, perhaps.  I had no help at all and this took me 1 hour and 15 minutes to prep, which included julienning a large number of ingredients - 3 of them sticky meats and 1 type of cheese.  I used roasted red peppers from a jar and, along with the 2 types of peppers, red onion and quartering a pint of cherry tomatoes, this was very time consuming.  I had canned, sliced black olives, but had to slice the green olives.  Delicious for sure; however, plan accordingly for prep time.  Lots of ingredients that require some time consuming prep before you even grab a bowl in which to toss them.  One last mention, I never buy anchovies for anything, nor do I routinely keep several of the other items in stock, so with all of the many ingredients involved, this is a fairly expensive salad to make.  As is, it would make a wonderful buffet item",
