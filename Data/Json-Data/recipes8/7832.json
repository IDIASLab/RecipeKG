I questioned the amounts of the ingredients, so I took a look at the recipe submitter's original personal recipe. The original lists 5-7 cups of flour, not 2! I halved all the ingredients and used 3 cups of flour. (I used 1 small egg and a full teaspoon of cinnamon.) I got 12, rather large, cinnamon rolls. Very good!",
