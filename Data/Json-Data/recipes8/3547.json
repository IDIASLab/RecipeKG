The only quibble I have is the chicken didn't brown as much as I would have liked.  Next time I will (as another already noted) broil for a minute or two at the end.  \nOn the whole, the recipe was easy to follow, quick to throw together, and the results yummy!  Bet the left-overs will be good in a sandwich!\nI served it with fried rice (peas, carrots and garlic added for flavour).",
