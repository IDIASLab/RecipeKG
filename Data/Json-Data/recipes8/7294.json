My son wanted skins for dinner but I was short on time and made these instead.To cut back on time and mess ,I melted butter in very small pan with 1/8 tsp. garlic powder. Tossed potatoe slices to coat. So much quicker than brushing. I used 4 medium white potatoes(I think any would do.)I baked 30min. Then topped with cheese and Oscar Mayer's real bacon bits in bag. Put back in oven about 2 min. more until melted. Watch, don't over bake. I will never go back to making the old fashioned skins again!! Thanks Michele!!",

I made just a few minor changes, I cut the potatoes, threw them into a bowl and tossed with just enough olive oil to coat. I also threw in the standard salt and pepper, but also added some dry ranch dressing mix for some added zip. I took the advice of other's by topping the spuds with sour cream before adding the cheese and bacon bits. They were so good, but what's not to love with ingredients like this? Thanks so much for a recipes that has already become a favorite in my house.",

Wow... this recipe went above and beyond my expectations. And so easy to make as well! I was afraid they would be sub par since they are not fried but that was not the case. Much better than any standard potato skin I've had in a restaurant as well. I salt & peppered the potato slices before baking and omitted the green onions because they just aren't for us. I turned the oven off when I pulled the slices out to top them the retained heat in the oven was adequate to melt the cheese. Just be careful not to slice them to thin - I had a couple that were much thinner than the rest turn into blackened potato chips!",
