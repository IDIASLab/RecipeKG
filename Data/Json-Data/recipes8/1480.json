        "description": "Yukon Cornelius is my favorite, and an all-time classic, character from \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\" Did you know that when he would throw his pick axe into the ice and taste the end of it, that he was actually looking for peppermint to mine? As such, I created this cupcake cake in his image with dark chocolate cupcakes filled with a peppermint-white chocolate ganache, and topped with peppermint buttercream. This is a fun and showstopping dessert--perfect for a \"Rudolph\" watch party! If not serving immediately, store in the fridge no longer than 1 to 2 days before serving.",

I skipped the filling and used my own frosting and flavors based on my family s tastes. The cupcakes were awesome! Easily one the best from scratch chocolate cupcake recipes. The Yukon pattern and directions were easy to follow though I decided to switch up the styling. Next time I will follow the author s frosting style because it s adorable! Because I was traveling pretty far with this I used royal icing to glue the cupcakes to the cake board. A half-sheet cake board worked perfectly as did the half-sheet box.",
