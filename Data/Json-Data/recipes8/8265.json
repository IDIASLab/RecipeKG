                "reviewBody": "Good beans! Great taste, easy to throw together and very inexpensive. I made a few minor changes based on what I had on hand and personal taste. First of all, I cooked the bacon alone untill it was browned, then I added the onion and ground beef. I know from past experience that cooking the bacon with the ground beef makes for bacon that is too underdone for our taste.We like it very done. Next, I did not have kidney beans or butter beans, so I used black beans and pinto beans instead. (I think almost any bean combo would work.) I also cut the amount of brown sugar in half and am glad I did as it was plenty sweet for our taste with 1/2 C. Next, I didn't have mustard powder so I used 1T yellow mustard,also had no white wine vinegar so I used plain white vinegar, omited the celery and added a little liquid smoke to the mix aprox 1-2t. I do not own a 4 quart casserole, so I just simmered it on the stove for aprox 1 1/2 hrs. I served this with sweet corn bread and we had a very tasty meal! I will definitely make this again and again. My picky husband even gave it the thumbs up! Thanks Kathy! Note..I give this recipe 5 stars only after cutting back on the brown sugar, I personaly think that 1 C would have been way too sweet. I would advise adding only 1/2 C, then taste before adding more.",

I might just use less brown sugar next time too because it was very sweet. My boyfriend said it tasted like pork and beans with meat. My other friend who ate it put sour cream in it my guess was because it was so sweet but I'm not for sure. I didn't ask him what that tasted like though. I'm usually a big eater but I was only able to eat one bowl of this and not even a full bowl. We did eat all that I had made though. I'll try it again sometime with a couple changes.",
