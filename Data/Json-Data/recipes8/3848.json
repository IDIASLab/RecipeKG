Traditionally, the men gathered to \"put down\" the lamb, enjoying friendship along with the leftover wine. They used family heirloom skewers (designated by their unique twisted handles) to grill the meat over wood coals. This amazing, yet simple recipe, was served at my wedding. It is rich in flavor, memories, and traditions. I hope you enjoy and start your own traditions.",
