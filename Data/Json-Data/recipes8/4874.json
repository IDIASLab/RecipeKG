Two notes: 1. For those who thought it was too vinegary, it could be the quality of your balsamic. The longer it's aged the sweeter and mellower it tends to be. 2. Cooking wine is pretty much bad wine with salt added. Never cook with wine you wouldn't drink and trust me, you would never drink the stuff sold as \"cooking wine.\"",

The best tasting mushrooms....so good that I made them last night, and I went to the store this afternoon to make them again tonight!...I used only 1 tblspn of the balsamic and kept everything else the same....I did use white wine cause thats what I had on hand. I bet red wine would be even better because its richers and the portobello is a very \"meaty mushroom\". Thanks so much for this very tasty dish. ",

I cooked as directed except I used my favorite red drinking wine instead of cooking wine (a bit less than called for) because I had it on hand. Then after it was cooked I made 'burgers' by putting the mushrooms on toasted whole grain burger buns and topped with bleu cheese and spring mix salad greens (instead of lettuce). It was great and I didn't even need any other condiments because the mushrooms came out very juicy! I will say that they do shrink up quite a bit during cooking and I could have eaten two easily. Next time I would add something to the menu to make it more of a meal. My last little tip - toasting the buns will keep them from getting too soggy. Thanks for sharing your great recipe!",
