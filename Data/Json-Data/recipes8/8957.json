I put chicken on one end of the casserole and cauliflower on the other and had a delicious one-dish meal.  My husband claims not to like curry, but he told me twice how much he liked it.",

Also to make it healthier I used Trader Joe's (no affiliation) reduced fat mayo--it's eggless cholestrol free 70% less fat than regular and 35 calories per tsbp. It doesn't taste quite like regular (it's a bit more tart) but you can't really taste the difference when you mix in other flavors in it.",

I used cream of mushroom soup and low fat mayo hot curry powder a little cayenne because i like things spicy half a packet of splenda to bring out the sweetness of the cauliflower and a can of peas. The only cauliflower i had was frozen and a little freezer-burned so i wanted something strong flavored to make it palatable. THIS WAS IT! It was as good as my favorite Indian restaurant. Will definitely make again for myself probably won't try it with the kids until they get older.:)",
