I decided to garnish with a spoonful of salsa. Great recipe and a great alternative to other cold weather soups. This will be a staple in my house for sure!",

I also added half a jalapeno to the onion and bell pepper puree. I chopped the remaining bell pepper jalapeno and onion and sauteed with the garlic and added to the bean mixture. Even with the jalapeno it was a bit bland. I will make it again but use less beans (maybe 1/2 a pound) so the ratio of aromatics/beans is higher. I will also try with bouillon and possibly add a ham hock. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",
