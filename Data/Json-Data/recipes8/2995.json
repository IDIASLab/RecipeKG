You know the ones... they turn up their aristocratic noses up at canned soup?  Ya, those. Look, these enchiladas are to die for.  I used flour tortillas, since I always have those.

I only rated it though 4 stars because i think next time I am going to reduce the temp to 375 deg as my corn tortillas were too crisp on the bottom also the sauce you pour over the enchiladas literally soaked in so it was a bit on the dry side - so I will double the sauce next time..... other than those 2 things it still was very tasty and will do again - also want to try other recipes w/that poblano sauce!",
