However, I only had firm tofu, not extra firm.  Maybe that is why the tofu broke up into a lot of little pieces and I wasn't able to use about 1/3 of it.  It made so many little pieces - I would probably make larger pieces if I do this again.  It was a lot to cut up, then dip in sauce and bread before frying them all in the air fryer.  I have the larger size air fryer and it took many batches to get everything cooked.  This recipe calls for a lot of sauce - we had a lot left over.  But I was able to use the leftover the next night when I made Bang Bang Shrimp!",
