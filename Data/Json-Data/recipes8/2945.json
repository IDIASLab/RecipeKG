                "reviewBody": "I will definitely make this again. I am busy mom with a busy family that enjoys Mexican food. We almost always order enchiladas when enjoying our favorite Mexican restaurant so being able to make something at home that tastes similar and can be made in a slow cooker is a BIG plus. I wasn't exactly sure how this recipe is intended to be served so I made some decisions on my own. Rather than layer only one corn tortilla at a time I used enough corn tortillas to cover each layer of the meat mixture. It took 3 overlapping tortillas to cover. For the last layer I used 5 tortillas to cover the last of my meat mixture and covered the 5 tortillas with the final layer of the cheese. After 5 hours cooking I used a spoon to scoop out each serving. While you don't get the nice enchilada rolls you do get very good enchilada flavor. As recommended by others I sprayed my slow cooker with cooking spray and I added 2 cups of frozen corn to the meat mixture. When I taste-tested the meat mixture before assembling in the slow cooker I thought it was a bit bland so I doubled the spices. I am glad I did. I used the 1/3 cup of water that the recipe recommends but I may try enchilada sauce next time. I didn't think he finished product was soggy in fact it was a tad toward dry. I think a serving could be enhanced further by having some of your favorite red or green sauce to spoon over it along with sour cream lettuce olives etc. as you like.",
