HA! He said it was better.  I ended up making Apple Crumble pie with homemade crumbs on top. I put a ready made pie crust on the bottom of the pan, baked it for 10  minutes at 375 degrees. Plied on the apples mixed with the dry crumble and baked it for 45 minutes. Put lots of crumbs on top and put it in the oven for 5 minutes so they stuck on the crumble. Yum, yum, yum. Now I just need to make whipped cream. Saving this recipe!",
