These muffins came out the most cake-like that I have tried using almond flour, which tend to come out dense and gritty. I think the large amount of baking powder and yogurt may be the key.  I will make this again, maybe with a cinnamon streusel filling and topping instead of the chips. I think the base recipe will work well with all kinds of variations.",
