The sauce thickened very quickly but I knew the alcohol needed to cook off, so I thinned out with a bit more beef broth and red wine.  I tasted and added a little more basil, oregano, and a shake of garlic powder (personal taste preference).  Didn\u2019t care much for the reddish color of this sauce, so I did add some Kitchen Bouquet\u00ae to give it a little more eye appeal.  Nice rich sauce with a deep wine flavor and so very easy to make.  Nothing fancy today, this was served over a grilled ground beef patty, with mashed potatoes, carrots in dill butter, and some balsamic strawberries over egg custard for dessert.",

I made it as directed, but instead of just using it as a sauce, I browned cubed beef in the olive oil and butter mixture along with the onion and garlic.  Then I added the flour, just sprinkling it over the top of the beef and stirred it so the beef was covered.  I added the rest of the ingredients as the recipe indicated and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.  I would have given it a rating of 5, but the sauce was too thin (I used the amounts the recipe called for on the flour, beef stock and burgundy).  I will add more flour next I make it to thicken the sauce.  I served it over egg noodles, and it was a hit with my family.",
