I made one with fresh basil  (1c fresh leaves) and it makes the best caprese, ever. My favorite, though, is garlic and peperoncini (3 cloves plus 2t chili flakes). I use it to make spaghetti, aglio, e olio. I use it on bruschetta, pizza, and literally everything possible. I even made one with dried Carolina Reapers. Wow. That\u2019s hot, but oh so good. I never refrigerate them and they have all lasted up to two weeks, but that\u2019s because we finish them in that time. These make beautiful gifts.",
