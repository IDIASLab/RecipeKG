I followed the recipe to a T - I even went out and bought stuff I would never have in the house. There is too much moisture in this recipe - they become pudding cake plops. The balls were so soft I had to roll them in some more crumbs just so I could roll them into balls. After freezing 5 minutes they were still way too soft. And after the twice dipping in almond bark the sticks don't hold up easily in such a soft interior. Almond bark is another issue - by definition almond bark has almonds in it - whole almonds. How the heck one supposed to work around the whole almonds is another problem. I really wanted to make this recipe work so I tried melted chocolate - same thing. It's the interior that's way too soft. When I put the balls on the lined tray they flattened on the bottom side. - not pretty. Though they taste okay they're nothing outstanding certainly nothing to die for. I hope the poster will double check the ingredients because it either needs only 4oz cream cheese AND only 1/4 of jar of marshmallow creme or it needs a lot more cookie crumbs to firm it up for handling.",
