        "description": "A traditional Chinese favorite, you'll enjoy the spicy sweet soy sauce with ginger and garlic flavors, ingredients that make this dish so addictive. This is a true General's chicken recipe which requires frying the chicken twice to give it that extra crispiness. The cornstarch batter gives the chicken a light coating. Don't scrimp or replace the ingredients or you might be disappointed. If you are on a busy schedule, you can cut down the time considerably by making and refrigerating the sauce and chicken up to 3 days; and doing the second stage of frying the chicken later. Serve with rice or noodles tossed with lightly steamed fresh vegetables of your choice, such as broccoli, zucchini, squash, and green onions.",

Cut the sugar down a lot.. if you use as much as this recipe calls for you're gonna end up with a caramel mess...when it says thicken up (sauce)...

I didn't have the dried chili peppers so I also used about 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes. I would have liked it a bit spicier so next time I may add another 1/4 tsp or so. As I crisped up the chicken in my wok I thought I would add the sauce straight to the chicken as it was finishing up. Bad idea! It was fine when it was hot but as it started cooling off it turned to the consistency of taffy. Very sticky on the teeth! Luckily I had only put a little bit of the sauce in there otherwise it would have been ruined. Be sure to follow the directions and put the sauce on AFTER. I also like using the chicken thighs as opposed to breasts. I think breast meat would have easily overcooked as you are basically cooking it twice.",

After the chicken was done I discarded all but a little bit of the oil cooked the ginger and hot pepper flakes (IPO chilies) in the same pan and just poured over the chicken which was being kept warm. Served over rice with a sprinkling of sesame seeds. This was an easy quick dinner as good as you'd get in a Chinese restaurant.",
