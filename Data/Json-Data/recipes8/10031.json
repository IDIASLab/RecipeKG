        "description": "This low-and-slow beef stew is very easy to prepare. It's just perfect for a lazy weekend supper. Once everything is in the pot, let the oven finish up for you, and add the peas at the very end. Of course, you can brown the beef beforehand, if you wish, but there is plenty of flavor and great color without browning. Enjoy with rice, noodles, or mashed potatoes, or keep it simple with a hot, crusty bread on the side.",
