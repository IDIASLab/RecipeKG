This is essentially the Eastern European garden salad that is available year-round. Everything in it can be kept for the bulk of the winter, either pickled or stored in a root cellar, so it is mostly a winter salad. The variations are endless, as are the particulars of the families who make it. I have eaten it with fish, without fish, with and without mayo, with sauerkraut, prunes, etc.  The contents depend on what is on hand and whether or not the kids will eat it! Goes well with either vodka or cognac.  As long as you have potatoes, beets, carrots and onion, you have the basics for this salad. Dressing is basic pickle juice and oil. Everything else is variable. I sometimes put eggs in mine. In summer--cucumber is good. Have fun with this!",
