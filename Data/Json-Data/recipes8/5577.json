I think the next time I might try making it without removing the skin, this has been a bit on the tedious side for me, AND then there seems to be no shape to the poblanos they just lay flat in the pan, this applies to any recipe that has said to do this with Poblanos.  Next time I will try just removing the cap and seeds and filling them that way and may add more to the filling than just cheese, maybe some rice or mushrooms and onions or something.    This would just making it more filling in my opinion.",
