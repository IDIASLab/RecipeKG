I only marinated for about 10 hours before I made this and the teriyaki was a little strong for our tastes. Hubby said next time try for 5 hours. Other than that this recipe is great as is and is super fast to prep and get in the oven. Thanks Cindy!",

A slightly stronger cheese would probably work better.\n\nAfter layering the thigh, I  rolled from the larger side then used a few toothpicks, one on each end and one in the middle to lock in the cheese.\n\nDrizzle a little olive oil on the chicken, roll them in the breadcrumbs and then top again with another drizzle of oil to crisp the breadcrumbs.\n\nI used a rack to lift the chicken off the pan and then baked for 35 minutes at 350 degrees.\n\nThis is a keeper.",
