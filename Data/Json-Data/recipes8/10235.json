This \"better than mom's\" version still has lots of old-school appeal but has been kicked up a notch with a rich and savory flavor, plus we said goodbye to the sugary sweet topping. Sliced meatloaf leftovers make the best sandwiches. I like mine with mustard, cheese, and grilled onions!",

I had to make a few small changes like no bell pepper because I didn't have any. I also used dried thyme instead of fresh and I used ground round instead of sirloin.  It still came out delicious! It still was Mom's but better! The taste was incredible! I thought the type of meat may make it dry or tough but it was soft, juicy and the ketchup topping revised will not let you down.  My husband's first bite brought a big yell- This is great! This is a keeper!",
