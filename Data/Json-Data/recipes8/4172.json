Original recipe is gluten-free, with no specific instructions for making conventional brownies.\n\nSince the first attempt, I have used my tried-and-true brownie recipe for the last 30 years: Hershey's Ultimate Chocolate Brownies (recipe available online).  In that recipe, I substituted an equal amount of plain applesauce for the butter, to cut fat and calories.\n\nThe cheesecake topping is marvellous, and made common brownies into a decadent, gourmet delight!    The only substitution I made was to switch the regular cream cheese for low-fat cream cheese (Neufch\u00e2tel), which has a  similar texture and flavour to the full-fat variety.\n\n4 stars, for the lack of full instructions, but this recipe earns more than 5 stars when you use your own favourite brownie recipe!  I highly recommend this dessert.",
