I added a lemon club soda to it and it saved the day. I think I doubled the liquid with the amount of club soda. It turned out really nice once this was added. I will have to figure out just how much sugar is necessary.?Maybe on a previous review? As of right now I would cut the sugar by 2/3rds and see how it went.",
