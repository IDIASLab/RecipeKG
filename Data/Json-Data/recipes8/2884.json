I also had no green chilis so I used part of a can of Rotel. Love the ground beef mixture. Tastes great!",

I was kinda hesistant about the vinegar, but it added a nice tang! I didn't do the whole dipping in margarine thing - just heated the tortillas in the microwave to make them pliable, wrapped them up, then sprayed with cooking spray before popping them in the oven. They bake up crispy but without the added calories. Thanks! :)",

Also since I doubled the recipe I made half of the chimichangas with flour tortillas and half with corn tortillas. I really preferred the corn tortillas. On a side note if you do make both flour and corn chimis you will have to cook them separately because the flour chimis do tend to crisp up faster by about five minutes. Great recipe that will be worked into the weekly rotation. Thank you for sharing!",
