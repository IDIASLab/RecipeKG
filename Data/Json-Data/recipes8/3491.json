It's a bit of extra work having to roast the radishes and onions in the oven, but well worth it because of the added flavor. I love that there's just a hint of dill without being overpowering and the lemon gives it such a refreshing flavor.  I had lemon salt, but decided to make the kosher salt/lemon zest anyway and I highly recommend it!Because the zoodles were already softened from being salted in the colander, I barely had to cook them 1 minute in the pan. I'll definitely make this again!",
