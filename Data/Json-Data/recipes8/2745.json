I mean, you can only eat so much salsa verde! But then I tried this recipe, substituting my fresh tomatillos for the canned. And now I know what I'll be doing with all those tomatillos that now have made their way into the freezer! Oh, this was so good!  SURPRISINGLY good, Hubs said!  I made a couple of minor changes, but nothing that made much difference in terms of staying true to the recipe  - threw a couple of garlic cloves in with the tomatillos and jalapeno and used flour tortillas rather than the corn (I've tried, but I just don't like them). I used No Name Steaks which I always keep on hand for quick sauteed meals like this.  They're very tender and so easy to slice thinly while they're still partially frozen. But I digress - this dish was so flavorful and had such character!  LOVED it!  Had to leave out the red pepper for Hubs but this had so much going for it in the way of flavor, color and texture that it wasn't even missed. To my way of thinking this is a perfect recipe, and a perfect dish.  This was so delicious I'll probably be dreaming about it tonight.",

Marinated for 7 hours. I did not buy a can of tomatillos since I had some fresh ones on hand. My preparation for the salsa verde is: 6 tomatillos husked rinsed half of a white onion cut up one jalapneo seeded stemed 3 fresh garlic cloves placed on a baking sheet. I roasted these in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes or until I noticed they got soft. I added them all to a blender along with a bunch of fresh cilantro. Added salt black pepper and the juice of a lime. Once blended I set it aside. I heated a little canola oil (blended) in a skillet and added the meat cut up sauteed for 1 minute. Carne Asadas came out very tender juicy and full of flavor. The salsa verde sauce was not too spicy hot and full of nice flavor from the tomatoes and seasonings. I completed this dish with \"Homemade Flour Tortillas \" \"Spanish Rice \" also from this website. Topped it off with chopped tomatoes diced avocados onions and fresh cilantro. I did not serve a wedge of lemon only a lime. A meal worth making again and again!",
