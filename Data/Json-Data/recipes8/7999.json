For those of you who are not familiar with mince pies you might be confused as to why I said mince pies are sweet. Well despite the name, and the fact that mince pies are made with mincemeat, mince pies do not contain any meat and are made primarily of dried fruit and spices. But don't let me convince you, check out the recipe to see for yourselves.",
