Thank goodness I placed it on a parchment lined cookie sheet. The topping was quite thick, which was fine as long as some of the liquid was scooped into the serving dish. The topping absorbed most of the liquid, making it moist. Otherwise it could be somewhat on the dry side. I don't know if the filling should have thickened, but mine did not. Other than that, the flavor was very good.",
