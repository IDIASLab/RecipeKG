        "description": "Sous vide is a cooking method that uses circulating, temperature-controlled water around food enclosed in a leak-proof plastic bag. Over time, the food reaches the same temperature as the water, but since it doesn't come in contact with direct heat, it doesn't dry out, and it's much harder to overcook. This recipe gives instructions for cooking a flank steak with a sous vide circulator, with a quick sear after the water bath. Because the temperature is controlled, you can complete other tasks in the 90 minute cook time.",
