Let's just say that for Thanksgiving I had about 20 different things to eat and this was the only thing that was completely gone. Half the people there said this was their favorite. Here's what I did different: I used 12 noodles instead of 9 and dipped them in boiling water as some of the reviews said the noodles were too hard after baking. I also added more flour since my sauce was not thickening (about 2 tablespoons more). I also added one large sauteed onion to the garlic mix. This dish was beyond good and I'll be making it again and again. I was a little nervous about the heavy cream on top but it was great. I baked the lasagna for about 45 min total and then let it sit for a cpouple of hours (to be timed with dinner) and then warmed it up in the over before serving. BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO!!!!! UPDATE: Made this again. I used a Vidallia onion. It worked wonderfully. For the topping I used half and half and just stired some salt into it (didn't have a mixer where I was baking). You don't lose any bit of flavor with that sub.",

I've had this recipe sitting in my box for a couple of months and finally gave it it's just due. This was extremely easy to assemble. I roasted the squash in the morning and had that ready when it came time to make dinner. Followed the recipe exactly, however, I did add a bit of nutmeg to the sauce and when layering also added some mozzarella cheese in addition to the Parmesan. Just a simple delicious meal with many happy groans from everyone around the table. I served it with a spinach salad, and hot garlic bread. Thanks for submitting a great recipe. Now I can't wait to make it again.",

While the squash was roasting in the oven, I put dry noodles in a 9 x 13 pan on the stove and poured HOT water over them. They were soft by the time the squash came out of the oven! I made the white sauce with nonfat milk and used fat free half and half on top. I also chopped fresh spinach and put it in each layer. This dish is perfect for a casual family dinner or as a side dish for a more sophisticated dinner party. I give it 10 stars!",

SOoooo good! Next time I will add more garlic since I'm a garlic freak! My 4 year old even liked it (I made 1/4 of it without the spinach for her).",
