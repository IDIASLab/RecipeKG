I ommitted the sage (none available) reduced the amount of thyme by half and only used 3 1/2cups of milk (which was all I thought was neccessary to keep the soup at the consistency that we enjoy). Very flavorful and \"high-class.\" Next time I may use 1-2 more potatoes and perhaps even the addition of a 1/2c celery while sauting the onions. Excellent soup and would go great as a first course entree' to any meal!! Thanks Kristin for sharing this recipe!!",

I halved the butter in this recipe and ended up just caramelizing the onions since I think the flavor is a little better if you can get them nice and brown. I also stopped adding milk at 4 cups because it was a pretty thin soup by that time and I wanted it to retain some thickness. Overall a very easy and tasty soup to make; quick to prepare and eat.",

Wish I would have read reviews ahead of time because I agree with others that it could use a couple more potatoes and a cup or two less milk. Because there are so many salty ingredients in this recipe I used no-salt butter to saut\u00e9 the onions and low salt bacon and chicken broth. I then changed the celery salt to celery seed and the onion salt to onion powder. I also cut back on the sage because I am not a huge fan. We thought it tasted perfect. Served with salad and warm rolls along with fruit and had a great supper. Thanks Kristin!!",
