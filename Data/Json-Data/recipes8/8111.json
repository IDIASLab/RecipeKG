The flavors were good and surprisingly the texture was exactly like meat. The tacos were a bit dry, I did not have the correct cheese on hand so I used cheddar cheese. Delicious! Definitely going to make this again as we are trying to eat healthier and less ground beef. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!",

I have tried the other popular brand and Impossible wins hands down! I salted as I went and ended up only adding a teaspoon. I used street taco size tortillas and went with flour but will go back to corn next time since that is how they serve them in my area and what we prefer. My husband and I are big meat eaters and big taco eaters and we both agreed this is one we will be making again.",

I added the onion, salt and cumin to the pan at the same time as the Impossible\u2122 burger and only added the garlic during the last minute, so it wouldn't get bitter. My family also prefers yellow corn tortillas, so I used those in place of the flour tortillas. Other than those minor adjustments, I made as directed. We all loved them! Our 20 year old son has recently decided that he no longer wants to eat any meat, so I can see that these will become a regular in our meal rotation!",

The Impossible burger will definitely fool the biggest carnivore in your life! I sauteed the \"meat\" in some olive oil (instead of dry in the pan) for 5 minutes before adding in the onion, and then added in the garlic during the last minute. 10 minutes total was perfect. Because the \"meat\" is a little more dry than real beef, next time I would top the tacos off with one of the traditional street taco sauces like salsa verde or salsa roja. I only used 1 teaspoon of salt and that was plenty... 1.5 teaspoons would have been too salty for me. I also used street taco sized (mini) tortillas (instead of medium size) to keep things more authentic. Bonus, you end up with 10-12 tacos instead of 6! I prefer corn tortillas, but went with the flour tortillas to make it as written. Next time I would omit the tomato and just do traditional cilantro and onion. Coming from a big meat eater, I would definitely make these again!",

While our family are definitely meat-eaters (I'd make my tacos most often with venison or grass-fed beef), these are a great option for serving guests with food sensitivities or preferences.  I used cauliflower flatbreads which are a bit smaller, which made for perfect three-bite tacos, perfect for a taco bar!  Definitely use the recommended cheese for authentic street taco vibes, (took us right back to Taco Bus in St. Pete, Florida!) and lots of lime!",
