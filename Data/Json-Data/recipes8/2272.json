I don't like it too sweet, so if you want to add more sugar, cool. But I think that this recipe is perfect. It also makes a great martini served in a sugar-rimmed glass with a garnish of watermelon wedge and a twist of lemon! Simply fabulous!",

Tip: 1 largish baby 'seedless' watermelon makes almost exactly 12 cups of cubed melon - and you don't have to seed it. I'm sure fresh lemon juice would be best, but after squeezing forever to get 1 cup, I supplemented the rest with bottled lemon (I told you I need a citrus press, MisterByrd, take note). Tastes fantastic! A bit time consuming, but fun for every once in a while. Thanks!!",

All I really got was somewhat of a bitter taste from the lemons. If you are not into tart flavor add more sugar than called for. I was wishing I had added a bit more.
