        "description": "My mom was a great Southern scratch cook. She believed a shortcake was basically a lightly sweetened biscuit, made to hold up mounds of beautiful, fresh fruit. I have tried to recreate her recipe, and I think this recipe is pretty close!  Mom's shortcake was best when made about an hour before serving, to allow all those juices to soak into the shortcake. It's best when eaten fresh, in one sitting, but if you happen to have any leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator. Garnish with sweetened whipped cream if desired.",
