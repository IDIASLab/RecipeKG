Cooked in the slow cooker on low for 4 1/2 hours then switched to warm to keep them hot for the party. Everyone loved them. I will definitely make these again for family gatherings!",

I love the recipe as-is, but have found that adding some cooked ground beef adds an excellent twist.  I discovered this one year when I had too many burger patties.  I just grilled a couple of the extras and through it in the beans with the bacon.  Very tasty!",

I added more ketchup & mustard to make it more moist. I used hamburger instead of bacon. I didn't get to use Worcestershire sauce, because I did not have any. That didn't matter to the family. I topped it off w/ cornbread batter on top of the casserole the last 15 minutes and baked some more until cornbread was done. I wanted to use Pillsbury Biscuits, but didn't have any :-) Great recipe and thanks for sharing. It was nice having something new at the table.",
