Unfortunately Mom makes all these wonderful recipes but she can't give you exact measurements-she does it all by sight.  I do have some recommendations:  Buy the medium semolina (sometimes called #2) because the fine semolina makes it difficult for the syrup to absorb throughout the whole basboosa.  Also, at the end of the baking time, turn the broiler on for 2-3 minutes to give the top a golden brown color.  Last, make sure to double the syrup ingredients. Boil the syrup for 5 minutes then simmer for about 10 minutes.",

I also use a fresh squeezed lemon--all of it instead of the 1 tablespoon in recipe. It gives more boost to the flavor and makes it sing! Try covering the entire dish with sliced almonds instead of whole ones--you get an ever better toasted almond flavor. And for my last substitute use Cream of Wheat instead of semolina! Not everyone has semolina flour on hand but most people have Cream of Wheat! The larger the baking dish you use as well the faster the cake will cook. I usually double the recipe and spread it into a 8 x 11.5 glass dish for quick baking. For special occasions and for the sake of presentation bake in a beautiful oven proof pottery dish like a quich dish or fancy pie dish. Or any shallow pottery piece is fine. It is beautiful when placed on the table!",

All I found was #1 and it turned out dense in spite of using a 9.5 inch pan. I think this would have made all the difference in the world. I made cuts both before and after baking and the syrup only penetrated these cuts leaving most of my basboosa dense and dry. I guess now I have semolina to try to making handmade pasta...lol. That said the flavor of coconut and the lemon juice in the syrup stood out. I think it would have been good. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 1 tsp almond extract which gives it a nice flavor!",
