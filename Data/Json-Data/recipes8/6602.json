I try to do this about once a month to keep it on hand using 2 whole chickens at a time. Depending on the size of your family of course. I cook for 4 so that works for us. \nI bake the chickens, debone and save the meat for soups then simmer the leftovers for 24-48 hours. Make sure to add 1 TB of ACV (apple cider vinegar) when simmering. This draws out the minerals out of the bones for good nutrition to your broth.\n Be sure to check on it occasionally while it is simmering because you will need to add water here and there as it is simmering. After 24 hours take out the little bones and meat stuffs. Grind it up and give that to your pets. Very nutritious. Then add your carrots, celery, onions and garlic and seasonings for your broth flavor. Simmer for another 12-24 hours. Then discard all solids squeezing out as much juice as possible. It might sound like a lot of work, but once you've done it a few times it will become an old hat. \nThis has been done since the beginning of time. Grandmas will tell you.",
