Re Klupskies not being a word (really???), this is what this family called them\u2014much like a nickname\u2014does that mean it can\u2019t be a good recipe? Plus, there are many family variations to most \u2018traditional\u2019 recipes \u2013including Kotlety Mielone. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, but maybe it will help, so I\u2019m giving 5 stars without making it to help offset a very unfair and pompous review.",
