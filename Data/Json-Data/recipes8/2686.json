I cooked and then cubed the chicken ahead of time. In a 5 qt pan I mixed a large can of enchilada sauce, a small can of green chiles, 1 can of corn, 1 can of black beans, two cups of white rice, and one package of taco seasoning. I added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to this after allowing it to cook about 15 mins. I sprayed the bottom of the pan with nonstick spray and added 6 tortillas spread out, topped with chicken mixture, topped with shredded cheddar and pepper jack cheese, layered 6 more tortillas, topped with chicken mixture and cheeses, another layer of tortillas and mix and cheese and left open faced. I sprinkled with crushed white corn tortilla chips. I cooked in the oven for about 10 to 15 mins on 350. It was NOT messy and it was SO delicious! WILL MAKE AGAIN...hope you try to changes it will make a clean, easy, flavorful, quick casserole.",

This ia a variant on an old war horse of a recipe and can be considered pretty reliable. In my case I took advice of other reviewers and served on bed of crushed chips rather than layered corn tortillas. With 70 people in the buffet line it would have been too risky to have the tortillas be hard to cut through and the bed of chips instead made it very spoonable. Just poor some enchilada sauce over the bed of chips and also mix some into the chicken mixture and it will be fine.",

I suspect corn would have been better.  I used mild green chiles, but cut the amount in half since I was making for my 18 month old.  I coated the chicken in a mixture of olive oil, garlic and cumin and baked.  I also tore the tortillas and rolled in the sauce before layering and used the remaining sauce to pour over the top of the casserole.  I also put a little extra cheese on top the last few minutes of baking.  \r\nThe dish is very creamy and tasty.  My 18 month old loved it.  It is really easy to make and perfect for the nights you are in a hurry.  I cooked extra chicken and put in the freezer for future use.",
