I used red onion in place of the green ones and sauteed them in olive oil instead of butter.  I also used 1% milkfat cottage cheese in place of the ricotta.  This turned out very creamy and tasted very good.  I skipped covering the top of the enchiladas with cheese, so I only used 1 cup in the filling.  Didn't miss it!  I also used fresh spinach cooked down instead of frozen simply b/c I had it on hand and needed to cook it.  I will absolutely make this again.  ",

Added cumin, chili powder, parsley, and cayenne to the filling. Made \u201c10 minute enchilada sauce\u201d from this site to put on top. It was really, really good.

I followed the filling part exactly - only changing the store-bought red enchilada sauce to a homemade creamy white garlic sauce, as I prefer a white sauce with spinach.  I simply sauted minced garlic in  a small amount of butter - and added my thickener, flour in this case, to make a typical Roux, before adding half and half to the mixture until I reached the correct consitency.  Used only salt and white pepper for flavor.\n\nThe filling is brought together with the Ricotta - don't leave that out.  It lends a smooth and rich taste to the finished product.  \n\nThis filling could be made in advance and assembled before  cooking.  \n\nVery good recipe.",

Note - i have been making green chili enchiladas for 20 years -- same fail safe recipe, always GREAT - but this recipe was intriguing - using the spinach and italian cheese --- wow! It also came our very smooth and silky, the whole house smells like i'm in mexico!  I made a few modifications based on my enchilada recipes - first i always use flour tortillas. I mixed green chili enchilada sauce with sour cream, some fresh cilantro and 1/2 a cup of salsa to make the outside sauce, put it on the bottom of pan and over the enchiladas.  I like mine wet and soft - also, cooked at 350 for closer to 40 minutes, just cook till it is bubbling and you've got it. What a great thing to be able to visit all recipes and expand your cooking peramaters! THANK YOU!!! this will be in my permanent rotation.",

I have never made them with ricotta cheese--I use cottage cheese instead because we like it better and it is cheaper. I also use cheddar or mozzarella cheese because that is what I have on hand, and fresh spinach cooked, drained and well chopped. I have used both corn and flour tortillas(we prefer flour) and both work great --the corn you do have to soften or they will crack when you roll them. Finally, green enchilada sauce is wonderful on them, but so is the red enchilada sauce from this site.",
