This is a smokey, chili powder based seasoning.  However, fajita mix is good too.  :)  Also, 2 bell peppers is a lot unless they're pretty small.  1-2 peppers depending on size.  Hope you enjoy!",

I used 1 & 1/2 lbs. ground sirloin and increased the baked beans to the larger, 28 oz. size can. I added extra chili powder and cumin; about a big heaping teaspoon of each, and about 1/2 cup of beef broth. You absolutely MUST modify the cornbread topping by adding a 1/2 cup of frozen corn and 1 cup of grated pepperjack cheese to the mix before spreading atop the casserole.\nIt will come out sooooo good, you'll wonder why you hadn't thought of this before! Excellent dinner and it's quick and easy too!",

I left out the onion and bell pepper and added a can of rotel tomatoes with a small spoonful of salsa.  And instead of fajita seasoning, I used enchilada seasoning.  Also, for whatever reason, for step 4, I have to cook it at 400 degrees for the cornbread to cook fully.  One last change: When spreading the beef in the skillet, I spread out half, then a thin layer of cheese, then put the rest of the beef down.  Very good!!  All that being said, I *love* this recipe!",

Instead of chopping onion and peppers all I did was prepare the ground meat (I used turkey) according to the Taco Seasoning packet added a can of rinsed pinto beans and a can of baked beans. Added a can of corn and a can of diced green chiles to the cornbread mix. SOOOO much easier than the original recipe calls for and I think that the flavor of the meat was much tastier when prepared according to the packet directions rather than how the recipe called for.

I also used a pkg. of taco seasoning, instead of fajita seasoning.  I added a pinch of sugar and a little water that I rinsed the bean can out with, since some said it was a little dry.  I sprinkled Mexican cheese on the cornbread mixture and baked it in a 9x13 pan for 25 mins.  I served it with sour cream on top.  It was very quick and easy to make; will definitely serve this one again!!",

I didn't have cornbread mix and had to use those Pillsbury cornbread twists so I thought it would work better in a 9x13 dish. Threw in an extra can of baked beans to have enough filling. Simply laid the cornbread strips  in a grid pattern on top and baked till golden brown. This meal took 10minutes to throw together and it was a big hit with the family!
