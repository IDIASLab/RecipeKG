They sure beat snacking on a candy bar during the afternoon slump, as the fats and whole grain keep you satisfied much longer, while the coffee and cocoa provide the perfect pick-me-up.",

I had to use what I had on hand: salted butter, table salt, sweetened shredded coconut, & Keurig caramel flavored coffee. I took Chef Johns suggestion and used powdered sugar as an option to avoid a grittiness. I left out the cayenne and I didn\u2019t toast the oats. (I just don\u2019t care for pan toasted oats or nuts personally). One thing I would not substitute is rolled oats for the quick oats. I have tried that in other recipes and the texture is not good. I missed the part about rolling in coconut and I had already stirred it in the bowl. It seemed fine to me. These would be an easy and safe treat for a child to make. Except they seem to melt quickly because of the coconut oil. So, they may be a bit messy. I used a cookie scoop and got 18. Ty so much John.",
