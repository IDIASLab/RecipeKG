I made it exactly as instructed (er.... except I did 5 cloves of garlic... hehehe) since I\u2019ve never made anything like this before and I\u2019m a novice cook. I\u2019m not on keto but just a wanted something tasty and healthy. I usually don\u2019t like cauliflower but the cauliflower rice was well incorporated and didn\u2019t bother me at all. The only thing is that I would like to find a way to make the sauce of the mixture just a little bit thicker next time (maybe slightly less water or a little bit of some kind of thickener? Or let it simmer a bit longer?). Sorry my picture isn\u2019t great, the red plates we have don\u2019t make food the most photogenic. Anyway it was delicious and I\u2019d definitely make it again even if I can\u2019t thicken it.\n\nUpdate: I had extra mixture when making this recently (I bought the peppers a couple days ahead and one went bad so I could only make two rather than four) and I just added some of it to some leftover spaghetti. Delicious!",
