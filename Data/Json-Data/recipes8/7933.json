        "description": "One weekend while my husband was smoking ribs, he mentioned there was some extra room and that that I could smoke something else. I opened up the pantry and there was a package of instant ramen noodles staring back at me and I thought, why not? I was shocked at how much flavor the smoked noodles add and how smoking them changed the texture. They have a firm snappy bite to them and do not turn to mush. The next time you already have the smoker fired up, give this a try!",
