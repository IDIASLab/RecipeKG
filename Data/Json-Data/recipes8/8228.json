The sausage gravy was so easy, but the best I've had. Thanks!!!",

After reading some reviews on the bottom being a bit soggy. I also cut my raw biscuits in half to make them thinner ( like as if  you were going to be buttering it) then i cut those into 4 pieces. I did the same for the top biscuits as well.  I cooked my casserole for a total of 23 minutes. it came out perfect even the biscuits on the bottom. I would have given this  5 stars based on flavor alone but I have to say it took all three of my children some real convincing to get them to eat this solely on the way it looked on the plate. We love Jimmy dean in this house so that was helpful. I have to say  when they started to dig in they ate every bit of it and even had more the next day.",
