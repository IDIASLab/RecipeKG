        "description": "My Okinawan grandmother and mother have made pickled watermelon rind for as long as I can remember. I've continued the tradition with this quick recipe. It's a form of \"tsukemono,\" or Japanese pickles. My siblings and I have always been taught that we should use as much of a fruit or vegetable as possible, and then compost the rest. Per my \"obaasan,\" or grandmother, the rind is good for you and helps your blood flow throughout your body. You can definitely find this tsukemono in all of our fridges in summer when watermelon is plentiful. Serve as a garnish, or as a side to rice.",
