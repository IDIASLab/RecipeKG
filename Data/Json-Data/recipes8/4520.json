I'll probably use a different recipe with almond flour next time for this application.  Also felt the \"Everything Bagel\" seasoning overwhelmed the salmon, etc.  Someone gave me a sample and I won't use it again.  BUT thank you for showing me the potential here.  The waffle holes solved the \"escaping capers\" problem.  From now on they go on as the first layer!  LOL",

Satisfied my bagel craving. I only topped with cream cheese and bagel seasoning, but very tasty. Warning though; I did overflow my dash with these so I may have measured heavy on my cheese or it may make slightly large chaffles. Thanks for sharing!",
