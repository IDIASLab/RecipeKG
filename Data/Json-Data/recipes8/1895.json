You may be tempted to use it as it is more available than the dried leaves. They can spoil your soup with a bitter taste.  You can possibly try adding a bit of curry instead to make up for the leaves and adjust the amount. Since I made it for 4 people, I only used 1/4 tsp of it to make up for the fenugreek leaves. I left out the squash as we do not like it.  As someone said, it is a pretty forgiving soup. It was very colorful and tasty! Will make it again!",
