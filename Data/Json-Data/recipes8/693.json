That day I savored Devon cream tea, which is a pot of English tea, warm scones, clotted cream, and freshly-made strawberry jam. I was hooked! I hope you enjoy these sweet and savory scones as much as we do.",

The combination with fresh basil is really interesting.  Oh - I substituted stevia powder for the white sugar, and brown sugar blend on the topping (I have a diabetic in the family), worked very well with no chemical aftertaste :D",
