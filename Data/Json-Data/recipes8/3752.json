The texture comes out so much better.  Don't over cook the shrimp or they will come out chewy.  This recipe can also stand on its own without the shrimp.  The taste is still fabulous.  I think chopped celery is also a great addition.  Especially if you decide to delete the shrimp.",

I used 1/2 tsp. dried dill instead of the fresh (I guess you could experiment with the amount)and Grey Poupon deli mustard. The recipe doesn't say what size canned shrimp to buy. I used tiny shrimp & they got a bit mashed up when I mixed everything together. Maybe it would be better if the shrimp just topped the eggs like a garnish. Anyway most importantly I left out the hot pepper sauce. I had leftover filling after I heaped the eggs with the mixture. I did a taste test by mixing a little hot pepper sauce with the leftover mixture in one bowl and a little white horseradish with the mixture in another bowl. I liked the horseradish much better. If you leave out the hot pepper sauce you just need to decide if you'd like the dish more deviled & if so what to add (more mustard or horseradish or maybe vinegar).",
