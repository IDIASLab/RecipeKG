The quality of your waffle iron is going to make some difference here, but even considering the cheapo one I was using, these waffles were still crispy and fluffy. I was a bit concerned about using the sweet lemon lime soda as opposed to sparkling water, but the taste of the waffles still ended up being very lightly sweet. I really could just eat a fresh one by itself straight off the waffle maker.\n\nThis recipe made exactly 8 average-sized square waffles with my iron. Despite how light they are, they're very filling. The husband and two boys kept repeating how amazing these waffles were!\n\nI preheated my oven to 215 F and let it reach temp with a sheet pan and cookie rack inside, and as I made the waffles I would place them on top of the cookie rack to keep warm while I  worked on the rest of the waffles.",
