I don't think this recipe is appropriate for the Instant Pot.  My husband (who is a better cook than I am) looked over the recipe before I cooked it, and he questioned it because he thought the shrimp would be overcooked.  We used 2 pounds of frozen shrimp and set the timer on the Instant Pot to 0, and after the 20 minutes or so it took to pressurize and the 2 minutes to quickly de-pressurize, the shrimp were slightly overcooked.  The sauce was delicious and made the meal, but I think a quick saute on the stove would be sufficient.  Next time we will saute the sauce with the broccoli (we also added fresh green beans) while thawing the frozen pre-cooked shrimp in the sink, then toss the thawed shrimp in the sauce at the end.  We served over brown rice.  This recipe is a keeper, and we will make it again without the instant pot.",
