I agree with the other cook, the shrimp would be overcooked if you left them in the sauce all that time; however I think the juices from the seafood add something to the sauce, so what I did was this: Add the shrimp when the recipe said to, and then remove with a slotted spoon after they turn pink and set aside while the rest of the sauce is reducing.  Then I put the shrimps back in the sauce at the end to warm them before serving.  Additionally, I was out of capers so instead I used a tablespoon of crushed, chopped soft green peppercorns (from a jar in brine). Worked great!! You need to add some fresh chopped parsley or basil for garnish, it is not a very colorful plate without it. There was something sort of sensual about this dish..I will definitely make this again maybe even for Valentine's day?",

While a little rich with all the butter and oil, it's something to definitely treat yourself to once in a while! The only changes I made to it were to add MUCH more garlic (almost a head) and I waited until the end to add the shrimp so that it wasn't overcooked. It seemes like a lot of mushrooms, but they cook down. This recipe will become a fixture in my recipe box.",

Three, wait until the sauce is almost done to add the prawns, otherwise they will become overcooked by the time the sauce is done. Garnished with fresh parsley to add color.

First of all the portobello mushrooms (because they are so dark) made the sauce turn so dark gray that it ruined the look of the dish. The sauce was very watery (no amount of simmering would help). It never did thicken up! I took the shrimp out way before the sauce was ready to put on the pasta otherwise they would be rubbery. If I make this again I will saute the shrimp and mushrooms separately and start from there. I will not use the portobello mushrooms again perhaps just white button. The lemon and wine tasted very good but this recipe overall was a huge disapointment. Sorry:(",
