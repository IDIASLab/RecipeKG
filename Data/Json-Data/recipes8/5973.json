I used Trader Joe's Organic Peach Spread for the jam and an individual container of greek yogurt which I'm sure is not a full cup.  I went with a heaping measurement on the spices because I like them.  I used a slice/core tool and cut my peaches into 16 wedges and layered them in three rows on top of the jam.  I did not peel.  The cake is DIVINE.   It has very layered flavors that work well together.  I was worried it was going to be too sweet, I often cut back on sugar amounts in recipes, but I used the full amount of sugar.  It's not too sweet, but I might try to cut back a bit next time and see how that tastes.  Excellent cake!",
