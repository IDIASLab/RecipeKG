I cut way back on the cilantro because I had homemade salsa that already had a whole bunch in it. Instead of lemon juice, I used fresh lime juice. Other than that, I kept every thing else the same. This is FABULOUS. I literally could not stop eating it. My oldest son and husband also really liked it, too though my husband did say that he would enjoy this more if he could scoop it up with tortilla chips! Very VERY good.",

They add a touch of sweetness. The fresh salsa makes this dish taste really good. Did not add the extra garlic to the salad recipe since it is in the homemade salsa.",
