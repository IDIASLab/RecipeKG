As published, this would confuse people as the recipe does not state when to add in the milk, cream and sour cream.  Thus only 4 stars. Also it did not need quite as much salt.  A small bit less would be better. \n\nCouple of things: I used my stand up mixer with dough hook. Worked just fine. \nUsed my rolling pin to roll it out- dust with flour\nCube the butter small, then put it in a dish and stick it in the freezer while you get everything else together. \n\nThis dough could have easily make 12 smaller biscuits.",

Did this for one more time for a total of 3X. Cut with a pizza cutter. I however had to bake for 15 minutes to get them browned nicely. I also bake my biscuits close together as I like the edges soft. I only used 3/4 tsp of kosher salt for less added metallic flavor. It was very good will make it again.",
