I agree that opening the oven first doesn't give a consistant temperature, second wastes energy to reheat the oven, but if the bird reaches 175 to 180 degrees internal temp it doesn't matter how the bird is cooked.  Cook and hold ovens that resturants use to cook turkey, prime rib stuff like that cook for longer periods of time at much lower temps.  Most cook and hold ovens only go to 250.  As an example it will take me 10 hours of cooking at 240 for a 25lb turkey.  The oven then goes into a hold cycle of 160 degrees.  The minimum hold time is 3 hours with a max hold time of 10 hours.  So it could take 12-14 hours to fully cook a 25lb turkey.  This is the way resturants are able to make turkey juicy.  Lower temps/longer cooking = juicy!  This can be done in a conventional oven as well.",

I then just secure the skin back down over the turkey with a couple of toothpicks. It still gives that crisp golden brown coloring.",

What I did differently was I added half the amount of butter initially and then rubbed more on with a rubber spatula the first few times I basted until the stick was gone. I must say basting every ten minutes is too much. By the time your oven reheats itself you're opening it again to baste. Such a waste of energy and time. I was basting every 20 minutes to a half hour making sure I doused every inch of the turkey. It was super delicious and really juicy. The juices seeped off of my cutting board and onto the floor lol",
