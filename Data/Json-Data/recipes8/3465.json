It may have worked if it was a little sweeter or had cream in it I don't know. The tartness of the orange juice just made the coffee a little unpalatable to my taste buds.

I also used freshly squeezed orange juice, 2% milk, plus one packet  of Saccharin Sweetener, and an 1/8 teaspoon of Saccharin Sweetener.  The next time I decide to make this coffee, I'm going to use Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder, cause I really like the dark cocoa powder.  I topped the coffee with Extra Creamy Reddi Wip.  Which made the coffee taste even better.",
