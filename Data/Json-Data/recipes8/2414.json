However I have to agree with other reviews that it is probably supposed to read 1/4 C of oil not 1 1/4. I had to cook more quinoa to get past the soupy stage...and I didn't even add all of the dressing. I will definitely make this regularly adjusting the oil measurement. I added black beans and have eaten it as a light lunch. Yum!",
