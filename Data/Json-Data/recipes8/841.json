But that s my fault not the recipe s. Really didn t get the tang from the apple cider that I was looking for but I did like the sweetness of the cranberries and the walnuts enhanced the texture. The distinctive flavor is the cranberries and honestly in the end this doesn t taste that much different than other quick breads that I ve made with nuts and dried cranberries. I had a couple very ripe bananas on hand and I think the addition of one of them may have added some moistness to the texture and that s not meant to be a negative because this is good bread! Enjoyed and thanks for sharing our recipe.",
