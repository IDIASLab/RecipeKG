I ran into this one and it looked to be right up my alley. I have to say I enjoyed it very much. I only made a couple minor changes. I used fat free sour cream and added some dried thyme and some black pepper. It was delicious and after taking my kids to a carnival where my only choices for dinner were full of calories it was nice to be able to take something healthy to my other get-together. The only thing I would have done differently if I had had it on hand at the time is instead of regular black pepper I would have used freshly ground black pepper. Very good recipe. Thank you.",

I chose this recipe because I did not have Greek yogurt on hand and wanted a sauce that could pass as tzatziki.  I would definitely recommend this as a substitute.  I added a small bit of olive oil mayo to the mixture, just to add thickness.  UPDATE:  Today I did not have any lemon juice on hand.  If you find yourself in this situation, use vinegar as a substitute.  However, do not use the full amount.  Just add until the dip tastes right.  I don't even know how much I added.  Also, green onions make a nice addition.",
