Added garlic powder and onion powder to taste, along with chili powder to taste.  Omitted the bullion cube, broccoli (used it the night before), tequila (drank it all while cooking!!!).  cayenne and cajun seasoning.  Mine got too spicy from just using the canned tomatoes with chiles so I added some sugar to cut the heat.   Served with corn tortilla chips to crush, avocado, scallions, cilantro, limes, hot sauce, shredded cabbage, radishes, shredded cheese and sour cream so each could make their own to taste.  The kids loved it with cheese, avocado and cabbage, us adults added EVERYTHING under the sun!  It was great!",

I don't know that I loved the green beans, but since they weren't part of the actual recipe I'll consider it my mistake!
