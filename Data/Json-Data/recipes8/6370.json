The onions were done according to the recipe. The cooking time was the same for both. I had a hard time finding the cipollini onions but that is because I was looking for them in a mesh bag. I found them in the refrigerated section of the produce department in a little plastic container already peeled. I love these little guys and now I'm searching for cipollini to plant in my garden. Thank you FrackFamily5 for sharing this AWESOME recipe!",
