Even though it tasted great, my family refused to eat it because it was seedy and the texture bothered them. So I decided to re-invent it with this. My store didn't have cheesecake flavor pudding, so I went with vanilla. This was a huge hit. The strawberries hid the seediness of the original ice cream. It may have been me, but the filling didn't stick well to the crust. If I ever make this again, I'll leave the crust off. I think my family liked it better without it.",
