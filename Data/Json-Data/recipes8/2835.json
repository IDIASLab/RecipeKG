I also added about 1 t red pepper flakes to make sure it was hot enough (boy was it!). I really liked this combination; the guacamole was a creative and good addition. I will put this in the regular rotation of meat-free meals.",

I'll make this one again for sure...only next time I would like to mash the black beans mix them with some light sour cream and spread the mixture onto the tortillas before layering - I think that would add a lot...then serve the guac on the side.

But I found myself in a bind when I agreed to have friends over for a Mexican dinner and remembered that one was a vegetarian. Coming from the carnivorous backgroud that I have I thought it would be impossible to cook a tasty veggie Mexican dish (other than boring quesadillas). I was more than pleasantly surprised when I made this dish and was proven wrong. The flavors of all the vegetables marry so well together and the combination of the cheese and guacamole add the perfect touch. I'll be proudly serving this for Cinco de Mayo. As my husband put it \"Screw it if it's not authentic. It tastes amazing!\". =)",

I followed the recipe exactly and what I ended up with had a very mushy yucky consistency and the combination of avocados and black beans made the whole thing look (and taste) very unappealing. Obviously there are people out there who liked it so if you simply cannot resist the urge to make this I would definitely recommend you at least use flour tortillas instead of corn.",

We put the bean/tomatoes down first then tortillas then more bean/tomatoes more tortillas and top it with fresh tomatoes adding more cheese and cilantro in the last 5 minutes of baking. It's a great vegetarian dish that everyone loves. And as you can see by my review it's quite versatile. You can add corn and jalapenos too.",
