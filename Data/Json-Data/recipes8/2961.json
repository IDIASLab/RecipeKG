So for those of you who own one and don't have the 8hrs luxury, go ahead and follow the instructions just place everything on your pressure cooker and let it do its job for and hour or hour and a half. The beef was so tender, shredded itself while cooking. Everybody at home loved it and it was great with tortillas, over potatoes, you name it. Great way to cook beef or pork. I cooked both and in my opinion pork tasted better with this recipe, although the beef was great too.",

Meat was dry upon shredding but we put shredded meat in with the sauce from the slow cooker and it turned out perfect! My husband put cilantro and spicy kimchee on his soft taco while I preferred icebrerg lettuce. For a sauce, we made a mayo/siracha sauce we made (used about 1.5 tablespoons of siracha for 1/2 cup of mayo for just a little kick-this served for 8 tacos). Will become a household staple-plenty of meat to reuse too.",

I do a lot of cooking ahead on the weekend since we're so busy during the week and this is a gem that will be used over and over. \n\nThe only change I made was adding a bit of beef stock to the crock pot just because it made me nervous not seeing any liquid in there.  I added maybe a cup or two and when the beef was done most of it was gone.  I just shredded the beef right in with it and it turned out great.  \n\nWe ate it on grilled flour tortillas to make tacos and topped them with shredded cabbage, cucumbers that we marinated in rice vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar), chopped peanuts, and a bit of sriracha.    My 3 year old ate hers on a tortilla with shredded cheese.    EVERYONE loved them.  Will definitely make again and again.  \n\nThanks for a great recipe!",
