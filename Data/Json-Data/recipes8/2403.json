Where I live, on the west coast of Mexico, agua fresca is made with every fruit imaginable. I had some guests for dinner recently and the evening was very warm. Half of our guests drank this delightful drink (with added sliced limes) and half had Watermelon Sangria, also from this site. Both were wonderful, but I preferred the agua fresca. And straining the pulp makes all the difference - thanks for the tip, Chef John.",
