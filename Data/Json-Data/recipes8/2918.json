I cut it down by half, and three people had plenty, with some leftover.  We liked the flavor, but the vinegar seemed to predominate.  I will cut back on that next time.  I wondered about using two corn tacos, but after serving it on one, I understood the reason.  One corn taco kind of fell apart, so two is a good idea, and there would be a stronger presence from the tortilla.",

The chipolte salsa was very hot.  My husband, who is Hispanic, said that it was  hotter than a habanero sauce he usually orders at a local Mexican restaurant. So I used is sparingly. \nI would recommend using a food processor rather than a blender for the marinade because of the amount it makes.\nThe only change I'll make next time is to either char the meat more on the grill or do a quick pan fry after grilling to put a crisp finish on it, but that's a personal preference on how we like our street tacos.  I kept the extra marinade because I will definitely be making these again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.",
