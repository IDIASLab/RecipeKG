Shiitakes were $9 a pound at the market while portobelllos were half that, so I used all portobello! And finally, cinnamon sounded completely bizarre, but a grating of nutmeg sounded like just the ticket. Chop the mushrooms and shallots fine and you'll have no need to puree any of the soup. Saute them until well caramelized for best flavor and be generous with the peppermill and you'll have a fantastic rich soup. However, the shallot flavor was a bit strong, so I'll use half the quantity next time. I am going to serve with a salad and garlic bread.",

Added 2 large cloves of finely minced garlic, too.  Passed on the cream, made a little roux and added 1% milk instead.  Still was very creamy.  A dash or two of liquid smoke near the end of the cooking.  Those reviewers who said this looked like sink water are sadly  lacking a real appreciation of what a good cream of mushroom soup should look like.  This is not the popular, sanitized for public consumption, canned soup... this recipe is the real thing...   A good chunk of crusty bread is required for dunking.  Yum Delicious!!!!",
