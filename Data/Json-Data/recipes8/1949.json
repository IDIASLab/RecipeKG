The hint of smoky flavor is just enough to balance out the sweet and spicy ginger beer and tang from the grapefruit juice. Use a high-quality Irish whiskey for best results! Depending on the size of your grapefruit, you just might have enough juice left to make another cocktail or two!",

I've made this  several times over the past 2 weeks and it is now my whiskey cocktail of choice. The smokiness from the grapefruit really sets this drink apart from others and is genius so don't skip that step. This drink has the perfect combo of smoky, tang, and sweet making it very addicting. I've been able to get 3 drinks each time I've made it...BONUS!",
