Didn't have plastic wrap so I lined a small round bowl with a plastic storage bag and pressed it into shape. I made the bottom flat so that it would sit nicely on a plate. The cheese gets pretty firm once refrigerated so I recommend putting a spreading knife out with the dip and crackers to make it easier on your guests otherwise you will end up with a cheeseball full of broken cracker parts.

I had used pre-cooked bacon and it just didn't give the ball enough flavor. I felt this needed something a bit tangier so maybe craisins instead of raisins or lime juice mixed with the chutney?
