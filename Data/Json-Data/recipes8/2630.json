We don\u2019t like olives, so I used artichoke hearts.  I added a few sun-dried tomatoes when I added the other veggies to the pan and I sprinkled fresh Parmesan and Krafts grated Italian cheese over the dish before baking it.

Do not to cook the veggies too much before going into the oven since they need to to give off their juices as it bakes. I use a cast iron pan which develops a nice fond.   Then I deglaze it with about 2 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water before adding the pasta and stirring  to to ensure it is covered with the pan juices.  This helps create the slight sauciness.   I also stirred about half the cheese into the dish at this point  rather that putting it all on top. Be sure to salt  the pasta cooking water and chicken well in advance.  Arugula added at the end just long enough to wilt is a nice addition.",
