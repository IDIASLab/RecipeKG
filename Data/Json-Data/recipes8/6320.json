I only used 1/2 of what the recipe called for (1/4 cup) w/ the full amount of honey and it was waaaay too spicy. I can't imagine using a whole 1/2 cup. I would think it would be inedible at that point. I ended up cutting the heat w/ some sweet chili sauce and that helped. The flavor was good it was just too much heat...Did I use the wrong chili-garlic sauce???",

Since the recipe doesn't specify the kind of chili garlic sauce I used our favorite Mae Ploy and added in a couple tablespoons of Sriracha sauce and I reduced the honey a bit since Mae Ploy is already pretty sweet. I tossed the shrimp with the marinade reserving a small amount for basting and let the shrimp marinate for about an hour. Was very tasty shrimp and we all really enjoyed them. Served with Easy Asian Pasta salad from this site a great combo.",
