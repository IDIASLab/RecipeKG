There was a definite lack in cohesive flavor. The spinach tomato etc completely turned out to not be a flavorful combination. The Portobella taste was lost to the funky taste and texture of the filling. Unfortunately will not be trying again. Also the avocado did nothing to help the taste. Sorry for the not so great review.
