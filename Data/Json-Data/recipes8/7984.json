The muffins are super moist and the balance of flavors between the cranberries and orange zest and juice is a perfect blend.

My one issue with them is that they simply didn't rise much. I filled the muffin tins almost to the top, and they didn't rise much from there. I think maybe they need at least 2 tsps baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda to help with that. Next time, I think I'd also sprinkle some cinnamon-sugar over the tops before baking. They could use that little extra hit of sweet and spice. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the tart fruitiness of these muffins. Thank you for the recipe!",
