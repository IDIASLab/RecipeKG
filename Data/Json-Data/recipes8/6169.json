To make sure the bacon was cooked, I precooked it to the soft stage (it also cuts down on flareups from the grease).

Had 50 large prawns all done up properly with bacon just partially cooked (To cut down on flare-ups on BBQ and time ) and DARN it if I didn't have nothing but problems with the wrapping of the bacon.  It would not hold the jalapeno in at all, they fell out during BBq'ing.  I ended up with throwing out about 20 prawns, which is expensive for me.  Nobody wants to reheat them and have them overcooked!!  I probably did something wrong, it really annoys me because I hate to give bad reviews, but this just didn't do anything for our family!!
