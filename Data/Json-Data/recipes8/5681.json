Luckily in California the lockdown rules were loosening, and my husband and I were able to host some good friends at our home for the weekend. The weather was heating up and while we were spending the day by the pool (pretending we were at an exotic resort) my friend asked if I could make her a foofie drink. I went inside, took an inventory of my ingredients, and the COVID Creamsicle&reg; cocktail was created.",
