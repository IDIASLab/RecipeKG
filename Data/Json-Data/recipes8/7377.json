        "description": "This creamy potato soup is good any time of the year, but especially in cold weather months. It reheats well and can be made without bacon or cheese. This is filling enough to be served as a main dish, but also makes a nice side soup if served in smaller portions. Feel free to add your own ingredients: other vegetables, seasonings, different cheeses, etc. When serving, some options for garnish are chopped green onions, additional crumbled bacon, shredded cheese, and parsley. Enjoy!",

The kitchen didn't have any celery seed so I just went with one big stalk of celery, that went into the food processor along with the onion and carrots. Other than tripling the recipe ingredients to feed that many people, and the substitution for celery seed, I followed the recipe verbatim. It was a hit with most of the residents and 3 of them even requested second helpings. This one is gonna be a repeat request by them.",

The rest of the bacon grease I used instead of the butter to make a roux with the flour and milk. I initially used the American cheese, but found it a little bland so I ended up adding some sharp cheddar.  Homemade garlic croutons sprinkled on top took it over the top!!!! All other ingredients were followed exactly. I made this in my slow cooker and it took a lot longer than I expected it to. I did end up having to turn it on high after 6 hours as the potatoes were still crunchy.  I highly recommend this recipe. My family loved it!!",
