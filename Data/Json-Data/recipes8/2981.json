I used a homemade enchilada sauce recipe, but I also think the a mixture of the cream cheese and salsa would be great as a top sauce!  I have never cooked with corn tortillas and they seemed to tear easily, so I heated them up using a little cooking spray in a skillet for 15-30 seconds.  A little more prep, but it helped the tortilla to be more flexible!  Thank you for sharing!",

I didn't have scallions which would have been wonderful but I added some cans of chopped Mexica Chilis along with Rotel tomatoes with. Chilis. I also threw in some Saxon seasoning and garlic powder.  I made the 10 minute Enchilada sauce recipe sauce from this site. I made the first pan by dipping the corn tortillas in the sauce before rolling them.  I then looked at the 20 pounds of filling that I had left to roll and decided that they were going to become Enchilada Casseroles. I basically put the meat mixture on the bottom of the pan, tore up the corn tortillas, covered with the sauce and loaded the top with Kraft Shredded Mexican Cheese. Browned in oven. The guys went nuts over it! I froze some of the meat and sauce for mac & cheese night to make an Enchilada Mac & Cheese. Sorry that this is so long but the recipe was such a hit, easy and forgiving!",
