This recipe tastes above and beyond all the restaurants I've been to.  It's also at least twice as spicy.  During my first attempt at this recipe I made it verbatim minus the salt.  Turned out perfect but a bit spicy for my taste.  My second batch was double.  Again I left out the salt (per reviewers' suggestions) and halved the cayenne.  Deliciously met my Indian food requirements.  My suggestions to you all:  1. Leave out the salt altogether  2. The recipe as written is pretty spicy.  Make it the first time as written (minus the salt), but if the spiciness is more/less what you want than modify it the next time.\n3. Please don't diss this recipe without trying a few modifications of your own.  This is the first chicken tikka masala recipe I ever tried.  It turned out wonderfully, but it was way too spicy in the beginning and I listened to the salt warnings, so I modified it slightly.  This is the only recipe I will ever use for this meal.  !!!!!  :-)",

I marinated all day.  For the sauce, I used 3 cloves garlic.  I doubled the amount of the sauce, which I would definitely recommend doing or there won't be enough to soak up with rice. :)  For a doubled recipe, I used 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp paprika, and 3 tsp garam masala (garam masala is KEY!) and only 1/2 tsp salt.  I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce and about 1.75 cups heavy cream (we'll try coconut milk next time).  Seriously, this tasted just like the chicken tikka masala we get at our favorite Indian restaurant.  Would be delicious with Naan!",

Believe it or not the black pepper in the marinade provides plenty of heat. 2) Choose a jalapeno pepper with a rounded tip & remove the seeds.  The rounder the more mild, the more pointed the hotter the pepper. 3) Aside from a sprinkle of salt in the sauce, omit all salt. 4) If you don't want to fire up the grill, make a makeshift \"grill\" using a cookie rack over a foil-lined cookie sheet.  Place the marinated chicken on the rack and broil on high (@ 5 min. each side) I also used thigh instead of breast meat & used olive oil instead of butter to saute the garlic & jalepeno. For easy sides, I served with basmati rice, naan, choli/garbanzo beans & raita (all from Trader Joes).  Enjoy!",

I only used 1 tsp of pepper and 1 tsp of salt plus added two crushed garlic cloves.  I marinated all day.\n\nFor the sauce I added one chopped onion and my spice mixture was 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp paprika, 2 tsp garam masala, no salt.  I excluded the jalapeno but added a dash of cayenne.  Wonderful!  The second time I made it I doubled the sauce to have lots of extra to top our basmati rice.",

I will never have to go to an Indian restaurant again for my favorite dish! The other reviews are right, I used one teaspoon of salt for the marinade and one teaspoon of salt for the sauce, and that was plenty. I also added a teaspoon of garam masala to the sauce. Since it was rainy and dark outside, I couldn't use my grill, so I baked the chicken on a rack at 475 degrees until done, and it came out perfectly fine. I like extra sauce to soak my jasmine rice, so next time I will either add less chicken or more cream and tomato sauce. The Indian restaurant I used to frequent put some thinly sliced almonds for garnish so I may try that next time too. THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER!",

I doubled the sauce recipe and added 3 teaspoons of the garam masala to what was already called for. I also marinated the chicken 30 hours; I was going to just marinate it all day, but something came up and we were unable to cook it that night, so I just cooked it the next night. It was tender and delicious. We grilled it on the barbecue and served it over rice with Naan. Thanks for sharing this recipe! 5 Stars with the changes!",
