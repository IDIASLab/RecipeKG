I am dairy free and for years I\u2019ve struggled to make a dessert my family likes. They loved this cake! Everyone went back for seconds, even my dad who only likes supermarket bakery cakes full of bad chemicals and dairy! Plus it\u2019s gluten free. No one even believe me. \nAnyway. What I did was I used coconut oil, half cane sugar half coconut sugar, full fat canned coconuT, And i found a super high quality coconut extract I used. I beat the eggs separately, one at a time, with a stand mixer and added the coconut and vanilla extract to the beaten eggs (enhances the flavor). I made in 2 9\u201d rounds in convection oven for 17 minutes. Frosted it with a homemade vegan buttercream frosting (it was drool-worthy) made of vegan butter, powdered sugar and more coconut extract. I also topped with toasted coconut shreds. \nIt was very very sweet (the way we like it) so you could easily cut sugar in half. It was so moist it honestly didn\u2019t even need frosting, but if you want an ultra indulgent dessert then frost it :) \nCan\u2019t wait to make it again!",
