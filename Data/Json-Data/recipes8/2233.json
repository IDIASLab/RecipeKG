We made this because everything in it is a favorite food item though we'd never have thought to throw them all together. Once we did we weren't sure how good it would be but we were very very pleased and can't wait to make it again. Though next time I'm determined to crumble some feta cheese over it as well.",

Here's how I made it quick and easy: I bought de-seeded and cut watermelon pieces from our supermarket and also fresh spinach that the market had washed and trimmed for consumption. Proportions of these are not critical: I estimated the proportions of the ingredients to reduce the recipe to serve the two of us well. For the avocado I used half of a perfectly ripe Hass avocado. Here's how I glorified it: Instead of using bottled dressing I made a balsamic dressing of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for this salad again by estimating proportions. I added some honey and salt and pepper to taste and...some fennel seed -- all of this this whirred in the food processor for a couple of minutes until completely smooth and emulsified.",
