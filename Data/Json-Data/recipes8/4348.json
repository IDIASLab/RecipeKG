Especially good for me as a diabetic because its carbohydrate count is low. It is now on my meal plan rotation. I would recommend using a large avocado so your egg can fit comfortably in the cavity. Also seated my avocado halves in a sprayed muffin tin to stabilize them. I did not lose any egg due to spillage. BTW the avocado skin is edible much like the skin of a baked potato.",
