We made this for Christmas morning and I would like to mention a few things about it. I gave it only 3 stars mainly because of the lack of directions. Do not plan on rolling this out as the directions say right after mixing it. I went against my better judgement of making the dough the night before and then refrigerating it. I ended up having to postpone breakfast while waiting for the dough to chill quickly in the freezer. Also, if you haven't worked with GF dough before you need to know that it is much easier to roll out if you put wax paper under it and on top of it. I rolled it out on the pan I was planning to cook it on with the wax paper underneath. I then used the paper to lift the dough off the pan and help me roll the dough. It worked much better this way.  One more thing I would like to mention is to go light on spreading the butter. I did use Earth Balance buttery spread, but I used too much. It ran down on the pan and made my dough spread out and look sloppy.  The next time I make these I am planning to use a little less baking powder and butter than called for and refrigerate the dough for at least a few hours.",
