        "description": "Beef short ribs, or \"dino ribs\" as they are called, are the new hot item in Texas and one of my favorite things to smoke right now. Beef short ribs are from the short plate before the 10th rib and have more meat than back or finger ribs. The famous Louie Mueller Barbecue in Taylor, Texas popularized beef ribs in response to Aaron Franklin's \"Best Brisket on the Planet\" designation. Each one can weigh 1 to 2 pounds. They are rich in flavor and a lot of times better than brisket. Yes I said it.",
