We replaced the bacon with \u00bd-pound Italian sausage cooked and finely chopped in a food processor. We added \u00bc cup diced onions and 1 more cup of water. We found during first time, after adding the pasta, the soup was bit too thick. We also halved the salt (\u00bd and \u00bc teaspoon), because after adding cheese, we found it a little salty. We also substituted pasta with whole-wheat elbows. The recipe was a 5 star to start, the 2nd time we made it with these modifications we needed 6th star!",

No one came near me for days! Update-use fresh spinach and add at the end. Also, use cannellini beans instead of northern.  Yum!",

To \"kick it up a notch\" I use crumbled hot italian sausage in place of the bacon, add a dash or two of crushed red pepper, include the liquid from the spinach, and use one of those \"Natural Goodness\" boxes of chicken broth. The seashells tend to asborb a lot of the liquid after sitting for a while, so I like to use the small shells, and fewer than 1/2 the bag.  I get rave reviews on this ALL THE TIME and it is some of my friend's favorites!",

I began by sauteeing 1/2 an onion and celery in about 2 tsp of olive oil in my Dutch oven. Once the veggies were tender I added the 2 cans of undrained beans 6 cups of chicken broth an 8 oz can of tomato sauce 1 cup of water 2 tsp of minced garlic and the spices... although I cut back to 1/2 tsp of salt since I used more broth and also added 1/2 tsp of oregano and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes. While simmering for the 40 minutes I sauteed 1 lb hot turkey italian sausage (removed from casings) and then drained the excess grease. Once the soup was done simmering I added a package of FRESH spinach and it wilted within a couple minutes and then stirred in the sausage. I added about 1.5 cups of whole wheat elbows and simmered for another 5 minutes then removed from heat so they gradually cook the rest of the way while the soup cooled. I added fresh parmesan and fresh cracked pepper to each serving and it was one of the best soups I've ever had! Thanks for the jumping off point!",
