I now live in New Mexico and decided to put a hot Southwestern spin on the recipe this year, hence the name. It's simple and tasty, and has some heat. I only added two jalapenos, but you could add more if you like it hotter. If you don't like hot food, you might want to eliminate the jalapenos completely. My husband and I both loved it.",

I cut the bacon into small pieces and sauteed in a hot skillet. Once the bacon was cooked, I removed it with a slotted spoon and instead of using butter, I used some of the bacon grease to cook the onions, garlic, and red pepper. I followed the recipe after that and I was thoroughly impressed. Thank you so much for sharing. I will serve this alongside a Mexican spiced chicken.",
