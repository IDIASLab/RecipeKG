When I originally found this recipe it had zero reviews but it sounded like exactly what I was looking for. I took a chance on it, +quadrupled the recipe for a family gathering. I definitely don't regret it. These were absolutely delicious+only got better when stored a few days. I actually melted the butter slowly on the stove before mixing it in by hand. I also rolled+cut Halloween shaped cookies; they were thicker than originally called for+took about 30 minutes in the oven before done. I kept the powdered sugar in the cookie dough, but completely omitted the granulated sugar the recipe says to sprinkle on top. Instead we had some cookies plain (which taste great already), some of which the kids enjoyed frosting with cake frosting, and (my personal favorite) I experimented; coating a few with chocolate+coconut oil ganache. My ganache wasn't perfect; I was rushed+eyeballing it, didn't have the perfect appearance I would've preferred once done. But the taste of these cookies with chocolate ganache was superb. I was asked for the recipe by many, and highly recommend these.",
