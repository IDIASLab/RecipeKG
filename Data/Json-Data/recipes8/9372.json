It's a perfect balance between intense chocolate flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness, topped with a soft whipped cream topping that elevates it to a whole new level of amazingness!",

Just a few seconds too long and you could end up with scamebbled eggs (I almost did this). This is very rich so dividing it in 6 portion is just enough for one person. Don't forget the whipped cream either. It adds just the right amount of airy cream to offset the dense chocolate. I made this for Valentine's Day, but it's an easy recipe for any special event or chocolate craving.",

It\u2019s pretty rich given the 8 oz of dark chocolate so you definitely need the unsweetened whip topping to cut the richness a bit. Definitely serve in at least six serving cups if not 7 or 8. A little goes a long way. Also don\u2019t skip turning the sauce out into a sieve. That\u2019s what ensures it comes out smooth as silk. Trying to think now how to make it for my husband who loves pudding but not rich chocolate\u2026 more pudding sauce and less chocolate maybe? Different chocolate altogether? Both? Will figure it out.
