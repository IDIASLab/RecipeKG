Chef John is the man.\n\nNext time I make this recipe, I think I'm going to turn the leftovers into an Enchilada dish instead of tacos.  As amazing as the tacos were, they were super messy, both to make and to eat.  I feel like they'll taste exactly the same and be much neater to eat with a knife and fork.  Either way, this was a truly outstanding recipe and I'm already thinking about the leftovers I have for lunch tomorrow :)",
