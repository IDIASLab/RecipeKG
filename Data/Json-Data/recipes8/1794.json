I used only 1/4 of the topping . The topping never browned nor did it adhere to the muffins. The topping went all over the muffin pan as I was trying to remove them. I would have given this 4 stars but removed 1 for having to throw away so much topping and deducted the 2nd star because the topping did not brown nor adhere.",
