I will try different varieties of peppers in the future and see how it affects taste. Instead of poblano peppers (they are not available were I live) I used  some mild chilis. I added a teaspoon of corn starch  to the sauce because I wanted it thicker but not cook it longer to avoid getting mushy peppers.",
