That aside, it does have a tendency to come out a bit more running than most breakfast casseroles.  To alleviate this problem, I use a 16oz bag of herb seasoned croutons. I also like my casseroles a bit more meaty and cheesy.  Therefore, I use 1 pound of turkey sausage and 1 pound of bacon along with 16oz of shredded cheese. I also add a bit of paprika to the mix.  The eggs and milk provide ample moisture for the crouton mixture to bake up moist but not soggy. As for execution, I mix everything except the croutons together and then mix in the croutons so that the add-ins are distributed throughout the casserole.  Then I pour everything into a 9x13 baking dish.  I take this casserole to MOPS (Mothers of Preschoolers) everytime it is my turn to cook and I never come home with any left overs.",

A tip for those who thought the bottom layer of mush was unappetizing: Put the bread crumbs or croutons on top then bake. Same ingredients & amounts just put cubes on top. This will allow them to get browned and make a slightly crispier texture than on the bottom. Just save a sprinkle of cheese to put on top of cubes and you can broil for a minute or so after baking for a nicer crunch/texture. One more hint: Use a pre-made pie shell. Load the ingredients minus the croutons and simply bake. This will solve the problem of mushy croutons all together.:)",
