While the all purpose is good and the oat flour is much better.  At a high altitude I did have to bake for 45 minutes to make sure it was cooked through.  At 35 minutes I ended up with a under cooked center.   But the recipe itself is great!  My husband and I both love it.  To give even more protein we spread peanut butter on it.",
