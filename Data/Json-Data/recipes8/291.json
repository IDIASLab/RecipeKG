The strawberry batter bakes into an unappetizing brown and the lemon batter wasn\u2019t really yellow either.  It was far too much work for an incredibly average result.",

The colors in the batter cook to a weird brownish color - it's marbled, just not in a pretty way.  I guess you could add food coloring to fix that.  The texture is really nice, but the lemon flavor dissipates completely while baking.  The strawberry filling tasted delicious, but never got to a consistency that worked for the interior filling . . . using a roux or thickening with cornstarch or another thickener would help.  The frosting is really pretty and tasty - just thickened it up with a bit more 10x.",
