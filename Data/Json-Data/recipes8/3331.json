Then I saw these taquitos!\n\nNo tweaking needed, they are tasty and crunchy enough to satisfy. For flavor boost, add your own sides. I made pico de gallo and guacamole. The guac was a good match, but salsa instead of pico would have been better, having a that  dippable factor.  This recipe made me want to say, \"Ol\u00e9!\"\n\nI lied. There was one tweak for me, or rather for my air fryer: the times given were too long.  I found 5-6 minutes total at 400 was enough to do the job.",
