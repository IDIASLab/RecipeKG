I used cooked left over chicken.  Minced very small.  Minced the onion and bell pepper small.  Cooked the onion, bell pepper - added the chicken and taco seasoning and cooked a bit.  Added about 1/4 cup water and cooked it down - add a little more water if it seems to be drying out.  Take off the heat and stir in the cheese.  For the tortillas  - I heated the oil and dipped each tortilla briefly in the hot oil - remove quickly so they don't start to brown.  Place a spoonful of chicken on to each tortilla roll up and place seam side down on paper towels.  Do NOT overfill.  Once all the tortillas are rolled start frying by placing into the oil seam side DOWN - 3 or 4 at a time - this seals the tortilla.  Once brown and crispy, flip and fry the other side.  Drain on paper towels and serve with salsa on the side.",

The only thing I did differently was fry corn tortillas on each side for a couple of seconds before adding my chicken mixture. I was so surprised how fresh they tasted compared to the ones you get in a restaurant. Also I made my own taco mixture with 1 tbs of chili powder 1/2 tbs of onion powder and 1/2 tbs of cumin. Nothing can compare to home cooked we love these and will use them as an appetizer next time we have a dinner party. I made mexican rice as a side and guacamole- 3 avocados 3-4 chopped onions 1 Serrano 1/2 squeezed lime or lemon and about 1 tbs of my homemade hot sauce and a chopped tomato. Season with salt pepper cumin to taste. If the serrano has too much heat use a regular jalepeno. So good.",
