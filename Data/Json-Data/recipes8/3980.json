I my self would rather have the onions crunchier as in the recipe. Thanks for posting it!",

The natural sweetness from the fresh corn and vidalia onion (personal pref) and light herb flavor from the fresh parsley and chives makes this a very refreshing summer side dish. Followed the recipe with the exception of cooking the onion for a few minutes before adding the corn and then proceeded as written. Perfect addition to our grilled pork chops tonight. Everyone here is looking forward to enjoying this again soon. Thanks for sharing!",
