Then wash the slices thoroughly turning them over and over under running water in a colander to get rid of the sand and dirt in which they were grown. It might take 30 minutes to get the leeks clean. This is vital and not warned of in the recipe. We have been served sandy leeks in restaurants.  The recipe is strange, since the ingredients list calls for bite-size pieces of boneless thighs but the directions ask us to take the meat off the bones and chop. I was not able to find condensed broth (no such animal).  I used boneless breasts since that's what I had to use up. No doubt thighs would have been more flavorful. I also used more celery, thyme and parsley than called for.   Next time I will use more barley, and there will be a next time.  The result was bland, as one reviewer said, so I added some Bell's and some S&P and served it with a suggestion to add more as needed.   Served with cheddar and crackers.",
