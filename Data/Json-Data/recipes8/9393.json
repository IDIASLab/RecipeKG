I also used fancy shredded MJ Cheese instead of cubing block cheese.\n\nI made the sauce in my Ninja Hot and Cold Blender using my enchilada sauce recipe adjusted to the spices call for in this recipe.\n\nI think using this process, I can turn this out for regular weekly dinner in about 30 min.\n\nGreat idea to sandwich the peppers and cheese between basically egg omelettes.\n\nHighly recommended.",
