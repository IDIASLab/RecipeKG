I was feeling adventurous, so I went for it but I thought it would't taste as good, it seems to be lacking in sugar. But it was good and my kids ate it. Usually we use a recipe w gluten free cake mix and it turns out nice and sweet. But this one I admit is waaaaay healthier so I will definitely keep this in my collection!",

That said this recipe was very easy. this turned out very tasty but was more of a cake consistency rather than a bread consistency which was fine with me. I thought the sweetness was perfect however if you like a sweeter bread you might want to add more sugar. I followed the directions as written however I did not have baking soda on hand so I increased the baking powder to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons. I also used Bob's Red Mill baking flour mix instead of the flour combinations and added about half a cup of unsweetened coconut. I sprinkled 1/3 cup walnuts and almonds chopped on top. I baked in an 8x8 square pan as recommended. I will make this again. Thank you",
