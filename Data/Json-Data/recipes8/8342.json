These came out perfect! Super easy, super quick. You can even prep them ahead of time and bake later. And this vegan beef is healthier than animal meat because it comes with fiber animal protein doesn\u2019t have and without cholesterol that animal meat does have. On top of that, it\u2019s better for the environment. \u201c Compared to meat from animals, Impossible Burger production uses 96% less land, 87% less water, and produces 89% fewer greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d LOVE!",

I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to tell the difference between the chimichanga made with ground beef and the Impossible Burger.  This was just a bit heavy on the refried beans, but that well could be just personal taste preference.  This is a quick-and-easy, delicious recipe and a great introduction to plant based meat.
