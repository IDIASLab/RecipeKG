Next time I'll pick up some fresh ginger to compare. The longer the gazpacho refrigerates the better. We loved the contrast between sweet and spicy; and the chunks of watermelon in each bowl is a nice touch I used extra. Yum! Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe Julia!",

This was a great way to avoid throwing them away, and a pleasant surprise because we REALLY enjoyed this gazpacho.  There is a fair amount of chopping prior to going into the blender.  I left the texture a little chunkier than it would have been at 30 seconds, but it turned out perfect for us.  It is a refreshing summer menu item and  does need time in the fridge for the flavors to meld.  There are leftovers for tomorrow, and I suspect they'll be even better; garnished with a dollop of  yogurt.",

DO NOT USE TOMATOES with this recipe. it takes away from the uniqueness of a great cold soup. my wife does not eat watermelon but loves this soup. i now have served it to over 20 people. ALL LOVED IT. thanks Julia jeff lantz",
