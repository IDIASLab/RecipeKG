Fish and seafood in particular, are best simply prepared with a light seasoning to preserve their delicate flavor.  I prepared this as the recipe directed, although I skipped the step of heating the garlic and oil.  I found the instructions to soak the skewers as well as the cooking time informative and spot on for the inexperienced cook who would appreciate them for eliminating the guesswork.  I served this over linguine with clams and it was just what we were after - flavorful, sweet shrimp, simply seasoned and perfectly cooked.",
