I used half the amount of sugar (brown sugar instead of white) and it was still quite sweet so I'll with that proportion in the future. Also I used one mashed banana to replace about 1/4 cup oil. The flavors were great but the texture was kind of dense and wet but that is likely due to my bread machine rather than the recipe itself. Will try again!",
