Because we use so many ingredients that typically are used for deviled eggs, this salad really did have a similar flavor profile, and tastes amazing. Garnish the salad with freshly chopped chives and green onions.",

I was pleasantly surprised that this is great by itself for lunch; it was sufficiently flavorful and filling, and you don't have to feel guilty or gross for making a meal out of \"deviled eggs\". Cooking notes: followed the recipe as is, and it was quite tasty with good texture. Boiled pasta for 8 minutes, with generously salted water. Definitely slice the vegetables thinly, so that they provide a crunch without being chunky - we went with 2 in for bite-sized veggies. We used sriracha for the hot sauce and it provides the right amount of punch and flavor.",

I did slice the celery thin but I chopped the red pepper and I grated the carrot instead of using a vegetable peeler. I didn't have enough egg noodles so I used bow ties.  After it was all mixed it just seemed like it needed something else so I added 2 cans of tuna to make it more filling (and give it some protein) and a little dillweed. \nBoth of us liked it and I would probably make it again although it didn't taste much different then other pasta salads I have made.",
