I add mozzerella after the chicken is cooked and serve with a side of tomato sauce. I could eat this chicken dish every week. The fresh basil makes it fantastic! I use the leftover egg mixture and crumb mixture to coat zucchini and fry them up after - makes yummy zucchini sticks as a side dish! Oh, I use half olive oil and half vegetable oil just to mellow out the flavor. This is SOOO good. If I could give it 6 stars I would. Oh, one more thing, I also flattened the chicken breasts with a mallet between two sheets of saran wrap before I coated them. The texture and thickness is perfect that way. You could also butterfly them. (Just gets more of the yummy crumb mixture on it then, yummy!!!)",
