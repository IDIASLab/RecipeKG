This is not your average chicken wrap...it's definitely taken up a notch and has a great smoky flavor from the bacon that perfectly compliments the creamy avocado and has a nice kick from the chipolte mayo! I used Hellman's light mayo along with fat free greek yogurt. There was a lot of \"dressing\" left over but that's OK. Next time I might try the ranch dressing option. I used flour tortillas and left out the onion altogether. These were absolutely delicious and a great way to use up some leftover grilled chicken. Perfect for a quick and easy weeknight meal served with a side of kettle cooked chips and dill pickles! Thanks for a great recipe!",

Also I used some spinach that needed used up instead of the lettuce and used the submitter's suggestion of making the chipotle ranch sauce instead of the mayo b/c I thought it would taste better once it was heated. After I put the wrap together I sprayed it w/ cooking spray and put it in a hot pan to brown/crisp up the tortilla and warm the inside....soooo good! I made this for myself for lunch today but I will be making them for dinner for the family very soon! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I had leftover roasted chicken from earlier this week, that worked great in this wrap.  I'm glad I read the review about there being too much of the mayo dressing.  I  made 2 large wraps, but I cut the dressing to half the amount and I still had about 2 heaping tablespoons left over.  I did pan brown them so they would be warm.  I realized as I was getting ready to photograph that I forgot the avocado.  Not a problem, I just sliced it and we added it as we ate it.  Great recipe, BethAnne923.  It will make a nice, quick summer meal.",

Bacon gives this a nice added bonus. Fat and sodium content on this is out of sight however. I probably won't make it again because of that, hubby is on a diet! Thanks for the recipe.",

I will make again perhaps slice into 4 pieces spear with a toothpick and serve to ladies. Very good recipe!",
