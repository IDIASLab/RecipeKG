After reading reviews I adjusted the amounts of some of the seasonings and it worked great: I used 1 lb ground beef for 3 burgers and used 1 tsp Worcestershire 3 TBL Frank's buffalo wing sauce 1/2 tsp black pepper 1/2 tsp seasoned salt and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. Since I had reduced the liquid in the burger I did not refrigerate them and it worked great and still had lots of flavor. I brushed on the barbecue sauce while grilling and added no other barbecue sauce or ketchup. I served on onion rolls with lettuce tomato onions and asiago cheese. I left off the bacon and didn't miss it. I really enjoyed this burger. I will make again.",

Asiago pairs well with black pepper and a moderate amount of garlic but with an entire supermarket condiment department mixed in and smoky bacon on top you never even know it's there.",
