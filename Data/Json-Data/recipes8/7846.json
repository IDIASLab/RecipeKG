But this recipe served as a fabulous base for a wonderful sweet/tart bread pudding.  The lemon zest added great flavor to the pudding- don't leave it out.  Here are the changes that I made: 3 1/2 cup milk, 1 cup sour cream instead of whipping cream, brown sugar instead of white, vanilla extract instead of bean,  sliced almonds instead of raisins, 2 cups cranberries- and could have had more really, leftover sliced potato and whole wheat breads instead of baguettes. I baked the whole shebang in a 13 x 9 inch glass pan- I am not sure if it all would gave fit in a pie plate.",

I used vanilla extract in place of the bean, dates in place of raisins, brown sugar vs the white, and I used about half more cinnamon and 2 cups total cranberries. Put it all in a 9x13 pan. I also lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees and cooked it about 5-10 minutes longer.  The 350 just seemed a bit too extreme for a custardy type dish and didn't want to fry the cranberries since they float to the top.  Turned out great!  The cranberries add a festiveness in color, plus were a nice tart to offset the sweet bread.",
