I make a crustless coconut pie that the photo of this cake reminded me of. So thought I d give it a try because the photo looks moist and chewy and quite delicious. Mine baked up to about a quarter inch tall and was rubbery and very pale. My first thought was it needs leavening or smaller dish. I made it again but added another egg and butter (like my pie recipe) and baked it in a smaller pan. It s taller but still pale with not much taste. So please help all of us with this so it will look like the photo! I will be glad to change my rating if the problem with the recipe is fixed and it turns out like the picture!
