In spite of everything the dish still was bland and tasteless. But it is not the fault of the sauce or seasonings. Modern factory farmed chicken is basically tasteless. The chicken are slaughtered when only about 6 weeks old so the meat is very tender-(the chickens are still basically chicks) and the meat does not have time to develop flavor. Those of us old enough or who were raised on a farm with outdoor free foraging poultry know there is a tremendous flavor difference between most of the chicken on the market today and the chicken of yesteryear when you could prepare them without any seasoning except salt and pepper and they would still come out delicious even though the cooking time would be longer.",
