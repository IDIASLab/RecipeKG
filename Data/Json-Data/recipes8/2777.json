Some traditional Mexican foods have potatoes in the ingredients...just usually not mashed with milk. I recommend microwaving them whole and then cubing them & sauteing with the other ingredients. (skipping the milk of course) This provides a little more texture to the enchiladas. The only other thing I added was a few roasted chopped green chiles that I had leftover from another recipe. These enchiladas would be great for vegetarians but my husband (the avid meat eater) liked them too!",

I think it improves the flavor & you won't have crunchy onions in the mixture. We prefer flour tortillas vs. corn so I changed that as well. This recipe is a solid foundation with room to improvise there are many things a cook can add to change the character of this recipe to suit their family's tastes. Thank you LauraKE for sharing and the other folks for their suggestions!",

I did not use taco seasoning because I find it too salty - instead I threw in 2 teaspoons each of cumin and chili powder. I added a clove of garlic - diced. I used green enchilada sauce which was the absolute perfect topping. And I used fresh salsa that I had just made myself.",

I followed the cooking directions on the pack but after cooking for the 12 to 15 min. they said to I felt they were still to hard so I then turned them down added a little water kept covered and cooked another 10-15 min. Perfect. When they were done I didn't mash them but kind of broke them up a little and kept going. Texture was perfect. Don't know if I would care for the potatoes being \"mashed potatoes\". I didn't use the salsa and used a 19 oz. can of enchilada sauce. I think it would have been to dry if I had used less. It turned out great and neither me or my husband missed the fact that there was no meat in them and believe me my husband would have let me know if he had. Will make again.",
