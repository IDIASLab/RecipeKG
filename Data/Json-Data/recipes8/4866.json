There were 4 scallops per person and it was very filling. I made a special trip to our asian grocery store for some of the ingredients. You could go a bit lighter on the mayonaisse on the scallops but it was good to mix with the noodles. Also if you don't like spice don't be afraid to still use the right amount of chili garlic sauce. I am the biggest wuss abou spicy food and it wasn't spicy at all. The flavor was really nice. One note: I did have to cook the mushrooms for longer than the recipe said but maybe mine were bigger. Thanks for a delicious and unique dinner!",

It's simple it's five-star restaurant quality and it's definitely company-worthy. I call that a home run! I used leftover scallops from a dinner out the night before (talk about cost-effective) and the ONLY change I made to the recipe was to quarter the scallops for presentation and I served over linguine that I tossed with about 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan (to add weight to the pasta). Other than that no alterations necessary and well worth the trip to the Asian market to find my new best friend -- Japanese mayonnaise!",
