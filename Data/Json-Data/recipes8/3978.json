A few notes:\r\n- I've tried Pillsbury Moist Supreme Butter Recipe Yellow cake mix, and both Duncan Hines Butter Recipe Golden and Pineapple cake mixes. The pineapple cake mix gave a stronger pineapple flavor (of course), but I got the best/moistest cake out of the Pillsbury mix.\r\n- I've had good luck with Land o Lakes Baking Butter...otherwise I use the ultra creamy variety.\r\n- **Try the coconut!** It doesn't taste like you think it will. It adds SO much to the flavor/look of the cake!\r\n- It's sometimes hard to gauge the baking time with this one...the toothpick test can be deceiving. Just keep an eye on it.\r\n- Another reviewer suggested this and I always do it because it WORKS...after layering the cakes, place the pan, upside-down, back onto the top layer. Remove it after about half an hour; this should take care of the cracking problem.",

First off, Golden Butter Cake mix, instead of plain yellow changes this from being just ok, to incredible. The amount of liquid needed for Golden Butter is also the perfect amt. for what you get out of the pinapple cans. 2nd, the cooking time is way too long. I'd start checking this after 25 min, as over cooking is one of the main reasons it cracks/falls apart when taking out of the pans. I have yet to throw out any of the left-overs on this cake, as the whole thing ALWAYS gets eaten!",

I placed it in an ungreased 9x13 pan, and let it melt in the oven while the oven was heating.  Then, sprinkled the brown sugar, coconut, and a 20 oz can of drained crushed pineapple, and the drained marischino cherries over the melted butter.  (I didn't use the sliced pineapple).  When mixing the cake mix, I added 1/2 tsp. coconut extract, along with the pineapple juice.  The baking time was a bit longer, due to pan size... about 35 minutes.  The coconut extract flavor didn't \"jump out\", but gave the cake a nice, fresh, (not from a mix) taste.  I'll definitely make this again.",
