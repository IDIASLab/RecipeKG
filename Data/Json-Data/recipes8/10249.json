It's not overly sweet at all, but if you want to amp up the sweetness you could certainly increase the sugar or add a lovely glaze at the end, or serve with whipped cream! It's the perfect slice of cake alongside a cup of tea, or call it breakfast bread!",

It ithwould be a great autumn treat to serve at a get together with the gang, served with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of allspice along with tea or coffee. Yum!!  It's a bit too 'dessert like' for breakfast unless served as part of a brunch.",
