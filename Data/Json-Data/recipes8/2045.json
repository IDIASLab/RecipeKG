I let it cool completely in the load pan and when I tried to get it out, it literally was \"cemented\" in the bottom?  Not sure why since it was well greased.  I felt the streusel on the bottom didn't add anything special and would probably just do it all on top and avoid problems.  I did up vanilla extract to 1 tsp. and omitted the nuts.  Used raisins instead but don't think they added anything so would probably make again without them.  I used lt. brown sugar for the streusel mixture instead of the white sugar.  All in all I would make again with my changes mentioned.",
