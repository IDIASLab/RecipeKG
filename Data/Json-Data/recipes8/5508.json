I cooked up chicken in the same pan prior to the fried rice so my pan got brown bits on the bottom. .   All that browned goodness transferred to the recipe- and I\u2019m not complaining about that.   (You can see how brown my rice looks in the picture). This was yummy.  The only thing I did differently was a yellow pepper, used 2 bags of ready rice,  my green onionS went bad so I didn\u2019t use them and I added salt.",
