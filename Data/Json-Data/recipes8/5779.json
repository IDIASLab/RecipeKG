Still my husband said \"...all I can taste is ginger.\" and he didn't even finish his. Don't know maybe I just had a large piece of ginger root? It might be better to specify the amount a little better say like 1/2 tsp or whatever. The icy consistency was just about perfect for me but there was also a grainy texture which I have to think came from the ginger root. Loved the idea of fresh orange carrots and grapes for a smoothie but this one just didn't work for us. Actually I might just try it again because I like this breaks out nutritionally and completely leave out the ginger. Sorry for the less than favorable review.",

I added about a teaspoon, a little bit more, and the ginger is pretty potent. I would tone it down a bit from that, but I do like ginger, so I don't mind too much. The texture is pretty weird, mostly because of the carrots. I didn't have a smoothie maker like recommended, do I just used a blender. \nAll in all, tasty and unique, but definitely not for everyone!",
