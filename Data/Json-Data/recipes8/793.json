Serve with some fresh fruit for some added sweetness to balance out the tartness of the lemon. While the recipe describes how to remove the panna cotta from the molds for serving, they can also be served directly in the ramekins with the fruit on top for ease (I would use slightly larger ramekins in this case).",
