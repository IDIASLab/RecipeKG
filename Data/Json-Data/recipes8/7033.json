Usually when I ate it, the fries were either mixed or under the meat mix and never to the side. Usually you can find yellow peppers at any Spanish Market, but if you can't find those there is a paste that you can buy too that works really well. For the fries, I personally wouldn't use the crinkle cut because of how thick they are. How I usually ate it was with some normal fries. But it's all to taste and what you have. You always have to include the rice too. That is a must.\nAnyways, well done Chef John for another great recipe! A personal favorite for me!",

I had to laugh when I saw the little carefully molded mound of rice - very Peruvian! And the carb on carb comment - spot on. After 10 years together I have gotten mi amor to just eat this dish with French fries. On the side, BTW. Finally, you can find aji amarillo in a paste at international markets, so do try, the flavor is wonderfully unique. Gracias,  Chef Juanito!",
