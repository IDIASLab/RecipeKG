This old-school frosting, stabilized and volumized with a milk-and-flour roux and equal parts butter and shortening, makes for a fluffy, yet sturdy, topping that's not too sweet to pipe on generously. Decorate with sugar pearls, dragees, or sprinkles. Once set, cookies can be stored in a single layer in an airtight container up to 3 days, or frozen up to 3 months.",

The frosting, however, was a different story.  It was light and had great flavor, but I was unable to get it to set up.  After about 10 minutes whipping the roux with the butter and shortening, it was still too thin to pipe (the frosting simply spilled out of my piping bag).  Not sure where I went wrong with this. Maybe someone has suggestions?  I will make this again and if the frosting doesn't set this time, I may try tweaking it myself.  As I said, I loved the flavor of the cookie and frosting, just need to make it \"pipeable\".  :)",
