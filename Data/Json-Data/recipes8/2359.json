After making it as written once, I tweaked it to suit our tastes better--I omitted the basil and cilantro (I LOVE both of those herbs, just not in this salad) and I use white balsamic vinegar (it is not as overpowering in this salad).  With just the mint, it is wonderful!  I have also made the dressing with and without the lime juice based on what I had, and we like it both ways.  This is a wonderful recipe--summer-y, fresh and unexpected.  This is always a hit when I take it to get-togethers, especially with the people who thought they'd hate it.",
