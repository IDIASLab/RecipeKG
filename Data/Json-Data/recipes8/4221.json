I would probably omit it next time since I didn't care for it too much with the beets. The dressing does smell really good as it's warming up though! I warmed mine in a small pot on the stove. I put the carrots in with the beets during the last 5 minutes of cooking since I'm not a big fan of microwaved veggies.",
