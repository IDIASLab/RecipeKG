They do not dry out as quickly and are very forgiving. Fill warm tortillas with sauteed chicken and serve with your choice of garnishes and black bean and corn salad.",

The first time I made this I marinated it for a mere 6 hours and it still blew my family away. Now I marinate it overnight for a flavor explosion the next day. It s a simple and quick recipe to put together at night before you go to bed. I made no changes. I stuck with the original recipe. My only suggestion: DOUBLE the recipe. You ll want leftovers to add to a salad later on in the week!",
