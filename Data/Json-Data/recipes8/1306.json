I did add a tiny bit of baking soda and a pinch of salt to the flour. But -- as you roll it out on a floured surface, it's so soft and easy to work with. I filled some with the apple filling and some with pumpkin pie filling.  The dough is so light and melts in your mouth!! I'm going to have fun using this as a base dough and see how many fillings I can come up with. Thanks!!",
