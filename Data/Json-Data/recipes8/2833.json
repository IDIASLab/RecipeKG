The problem is the recipe doesn't specify thickness of potatoes which made a big difference in how it turns out. Too thick and they're underdone too thin and they fall apart before you get the eggs in. I also think it would benefit from a little garlic and finely chopped green pepper. Also I added some shredded cheddar cheese inside the tortilla. Final verdict: it's okay but not that special.",
