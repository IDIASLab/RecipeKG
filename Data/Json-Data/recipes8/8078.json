Someone gave me some powdered milk had no idea what I was going to do with it now I found a use! Watch out when spacing the cookies they do spread out. Can't wait to try the other recipes for the cookie mix. Thanks!",

You could also add in some peppermint chips by Andes for a unique chocolate mint cookie.",
