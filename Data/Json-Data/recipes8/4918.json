And unless you really want oregano-sauteed mushrooms 2 tsp of oregano IMO is WAY too much. I used baby portobellas and sliced mine instead of chopping for a better presentation. I mixed up the seasoning but only added about half of it because the mushrooms were getting really \"gummy\". I like oregano but it just overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the mushrooms. Mushrooms release a lot of liquid and cook quickly so I have to wonder if you really even need 3 tbsp of fat.",

I agree with other reviewers that this recipe is heavy on spices for only one cup of mushrooms. Less is more!! I chose to add the recipe's optional ingredient of steak seasoning but I only \"dusted\" it over the mushrooms instead of measuring a full tsp! I also felt they needed a shake or two of salt. I hate not giving high ratings for recipes but since I had to completely alter the recipe to avoid wasting perfectly good mushrooms I think 3 out of 5 for the original recipe is a fair rating.",
