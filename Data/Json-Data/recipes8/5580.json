Sadly I didn't realize that until I cut into it and I even used a 9 inch vs 8 inch pan. Thankfully it was done enough to eat but the texture was more of a bread pudding than a pancake. I will try this again with the additional bake time and update my review accordingly. I did like the brown sugar and cinnamon topping! I served this with butter & maple syrup!",

Once I loosened the sides it flipped right onto the plate although unfortunately it left the brown sugar behind. I think I would enjoy this more in a 9 inch pan I thought it was a little too thick. DBF and DS loved this for supper with some maple sausage patties and fresh cantaloupe. Thanks for the recipe Shannon!",
