You can get them at Costco and most other markets.  Just chop them up add water chestnuts, mushrooms and shredded carrots. Stir in some oyster sauce and soy sauce to taste and you've got your filling. Use butter lettuce for the wrappers and garnish with cilantro, green onions, and crispy wonton strips. Use your favorite sauce (we like sweet hot chili sauce and peanut sauce. Hoisin is good too)  it is much easier on a busy weeknight.",

Sure there is a lot of chopping and sure the ingredient list is long, but it's all easy stuff to chop and all of the ingredients are things I keep in my kitchen most of the time anyway.  The payoff is worth the trouble.  The flavor is really complex and delicious and there's just a little bit of kick from the hot pepper.  I served them with Bibb lettuce instead of iceberg and I also made a mix of radish, carrots, bell pepper, jalapeno, cilantro and rice wine vinegar, salt and sugar that added just the right amount of fresh.  I'll definitely be making this again soon.",

So yeah, I felt like my grandmother slaving over a hot stove for 2 hours only I was over my chopping board, skinning the thighs, then deboning them.  Ugh!! Then, my measuring spoons are plastic, so the words are half gone and I mistook tablespoon with teaspoon on a few occasions...double yikes!  Umm can you tell I don't cook much yet?  So anyhoo, even with all those challenges we both loved this cool spin on lettuce wraps.  I made it again the following week exactly how the recipe said I should and got a completely different taste...almost Middle Eastern curry-ish...double yum!  So yeah, if you fudge on the brown sugar too much or not enough, you are still golden.  I didn't do the water chestnuts, my husband is a man-child and would spit them out like Peter on Family Guy :)",

The second time I used chicken thighs and -- wow!-- what a difference. They were both very good but the juiciness of the thigh meat really added so much to the texture and flavor. I had to modify this a bit because I strongly dislike mushrooms. (The flavor the texture the fact that they're a fungus...) I followed just about everything else to the letter omitting the mushrooms and about 5 ounces of chicken to keep the vegetable ratio true to its original recipe. I used a sweet onion versus yellow because it's all I had on hand. My hubby absolutely loved this but was disappointed that I didn't include the mushrooms.:-P",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was a LOT of work for mediocre results. Other than using cremini mushrooms and dicing the chicken quite small I followed the recipe as written. The result lacked the bold Asian taste I was hoping for so I added 2-3 tablespoons of hoisin sauce which helped. I also whipped up 2 dipping sauces and served with chopped peanuts. Every other Chef John recipe I've tried has been wonderful but I will not make this one again. Sauce 1: 1tsp sesame oil 2T soy 2T rice vinegar 1T chili paste 1tsp brown sugar. Sauce 2: 1/3c mayo 1tsp sriracha sauce 1tsp chili oil 1tsp lime juice.",
