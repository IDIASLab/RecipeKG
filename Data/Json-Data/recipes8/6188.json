I changed my plans and used this instead.  It was awesome. This needs ginger -- if you have fresh, better, but spice rack will do the trick.  Add a little red pepper too.   Quite honestly, the richness in flavor was just under the mark, but I think with a little more marinating/soaking, this would be a six star.  I found a peanut sauce recipe on the site (with fish sauce, chili oil, and vinegar), and it was great.  Everyone knew that we were having Satay when they walked in the house.  Served with basmati rice with a couple of peas/cilantro/ and green onion thrown in.  Muy bueno.  If I knew how to say \"really good\" in Thai, then you get the picture. As an update, strips of pork tenderloin work really well too, and they're low fat!",

We were afraid that they might come out too spicy but they weren't too hot at all. In fact if you like spicy food I would definitely add more curry paste or red pepper flakes because these only have a little zing. Just right for us wimps out there!",
