I'm knocking down one star due to the method because my beef did not get tender and the gravy did not thicken up in an hour of cooking time. I suspect the temperature was a bit high for tender beef. I thickened the gravy with some arrowroot powder and added a bit of homemade seasoned salt. I served over mashed potatoes and DH was a happy man. Thanks for the idea!",
