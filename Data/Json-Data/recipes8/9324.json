I cut the recipe in half, but still used the full 1/3 cup of buffalo sauce. I also used low fat cream cheese and shredded pepper jack, just because that's what I had on hand. I also seasoned the chicken with salt/pepper/garlic powder while it browned, but that probably wasn't even necessary. I will definitely make this again!",
