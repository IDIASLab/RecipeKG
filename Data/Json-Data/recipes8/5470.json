                "reviewBody": "I've made Potato Candy in the past, and since have lost that recipe. This recipe looked right, so I gave it a shot. Like many others here, my mixture was nothing but soup and completely unusable\u2026then I evaluated the situation and realized why.\n\nHere's what's wrong with this recipe: The recipe calls for 1 (16 ounce/1 pound) package of Confectioners Sugar\u2026THIS is nowhere near enough. If you shop at Wal-Mart, you'll notice that their bag is (32 ounce/2 pounds), this entire bag is what you should be using, not half of it, or your typical 1 pound \"box\".\n\n\nIn addition, a little adjustment to the directions- \n1. After mashing your potato with vanilla and milk, refrigerate it then, not after it's dough- the cold dough is too hard to work with.\n2. After your mashed potatoes have cooled off, mix in half of the sugar all at once. (it's ok if it's soupy at this point) Then, after that is mixed, dump in the rest of the sugar all at once, and mix. (this time it should make dough)\n3. Do Not refrigerate your dough before you try to roll it, your dough should be workable right out of the bowl. Chilling the dough will just make it harder to work with.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nNote: I have an alternate recipe for this in my collection, with the correct ingredient list and helpful tips within the instructions. Come on over and try it out!",

I followed the directions to the letter and somehow ended up with nothing even close to being able to be served to my daughters class.

It was a blob of soft dough that even after 1 hour in refrig it was nearly impossible to roll out. I had to add at least 1 1/2 to 2 cups more sugar(and it should have been more) in order to roll it. Then the peanut butter was so hard to spread! I needed much more than 1/3 cup just to cover the dough. Then the act of rolling the dough it was more like pushing it into a form of a log. Shish! Not really worth the frustration even if it is an Irish tradition. And in the end it just too sweet.",

Start with only HALF of a small boiled potato (peeled and mashed) add a lid of vanilla and mix. Then add 3 large spoons of powdered sugar and mix up a little let set for a few minutes. When you come back the sugar and potato mix begins to melt! Keep adding and mixing in powdered sugar until you get a pie dough consistency. This takes a lot of powdered sugar and mixing - it's a great arm workout. Once pie dough consistency is met sprinkle powdered sugar on a clean dry surface rub on hands and then roll out the dough to about a 1/4\" thick. Then use CRUNCHY peanut butter spread over the surface. Roll up the dough cut into 3 sections. For each section roll it out until less than 1.5\" in diameter. Do so for each segment (or wrap and store in fridge for later) then cut into bite size slices. Store in fridge. The crunchy peanut butter adds texture and keeps the entire thing from being too runny or so sweet. Some people even add shredded coconut. I wonder what adding dark chocolate shavings would do...",

Most recipes do not call for milk and milk is most likely the reason for the soupy mess many got. If milk is added more sugar will likely be needed. Hope this helps!",
