Almost every rice recipe requires two parts liquid/broth to one part rice. Otherwise, PRIMO. I actually went to the trouble to find all the 'exotic' ingredients. Portland OR has a great Thai-oriented grocery called Lily's Market. If you have an Asian community in your community, you should be able to find these ingredients. The panda leaves, shown as optional, are incredibly aromatic and like nothing else. When you smell them, you realize you've been exposed to them in every Thai restaurant you've ever been in.",

They're chopped in big slivers vs. chopped pieces. When I cooked the rice we used 3 cups of broth vs. 2 cups of broth and it came out good. Not too wet or dry. The food came out good but I'd stick to buying this instead.",

Personally I recommend buying some nam jim sauce in the store as a backup, since this sauce is known to be difficult to properly make.
