I wanted to do something outside of the traditional sides like corn on the cob and potato. It's now a family favorite! Goes well with a grilled steak or tuna steak as well. The combination of sweet with the corn and salty with the feta is an unexpected delight!",

Didn't have the white wine vinegar and used 1 T. lemon juice +  2 T. apple cider vinegar.  Didn't have cherry tomatoes and used 1 large red and 1 yellow heirloom tomatoes diced.  It probably added more liquid to the salad but we both enjoyed it.",
