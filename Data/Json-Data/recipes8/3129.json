I added mushrooms and fresh cilantro to mine as well as substituting green onions instead of regular onion. I thought an 8x8 casserole wouldnt be enough for our family and considered doubling the recipe, but went ahead and made as is. Turned out to be a perfect amount for three adults as it is very filling. I'll be making this one again for sure. Thanks for sharing!",
