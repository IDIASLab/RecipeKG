I altered the recipe in some minor ways according to what I had on hand. I used 20oz. ground turkey (that's what was in the pkg.) two medium sized portobella mushroom caps (probably about 3oz.) and feta cheese rather than blue cheese that I crumbled into the mixture before cooking. I also cooked them on the stovetop in a nonstick pan sprayed with oil. I made the patties rather small there were 10 total thus avoiding the 'falling apart' problem mentioned in a couple of the reviews. They were great! I have already added this recipe to my personal file and will undoubtedly use it as a starting point for endless variations.",
