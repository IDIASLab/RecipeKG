Made this for a big crowd and wasn't sure of everyone's tolerance or liking hot jalape\u00f1os so I reduced the amount  of these to only 2 (could have safely gone with three).  After mixing everything together I thought it needed just a bit more seasoning so added a bit of salt and maybe 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  This took it over the top and everyone loved them!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Okay at first the cumin ingredient freaked me out and seemed out of place but I still used it. And so glad I did! Also I just used a very tiny can of diced jalapenos drained - easier than donning gloves and chopping. Admittedly I have not even stuffed and baked the mushrooms yet because I am finding this to be one awesome cracker spread!!! So I guess I shouldn't rate the recipe in full just yet but I'll give the filling a high five and I'm sure the shrooms will be awesome!",
