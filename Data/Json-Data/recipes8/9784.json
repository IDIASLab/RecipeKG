I made the recipe today for a birthday party but left the flavors out.  I'm also glad to see that the Mascarpone thing has caught on, not so much for the flavor it brings to Whipped Cream (well that too) but rather the fact that it \"holds and preserves\" the cream.  Any leftover cake (refrigerated) will look and taste just a good as it did the day before.",
