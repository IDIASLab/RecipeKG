More of a stew than a soup, which is the way we like it, not very brothy, but you could always just add broth if you wanted something soupier.  It seems like a pretty healthy meal, overall, lots of vegetables and not so much meat.  Great flavor combination, with the savory, salty ham offsetting the tender broccoli and sweeter sweet potato.  I used broth instead of bouillon and water, but that was a pretty minor change.  Nice recipe.",
