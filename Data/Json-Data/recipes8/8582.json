I considered next time removing the chicken and thickening the sauce (was thinner than I anticipated) but hubby said no, don't change a thing!\r\n\r\nI must respond to KRCOOK's nasty review .. first if you are not a fan of canned soup recipes - DON'T TRY THEM. Second, ok so it doesn't serve up like a meal in a gourmet restaurant but we are home cooks here generously sharing our family tried and true recipes - not executive chefs.",

However I decided to give it a try it sounded so exotic I guess due to the mention of the combination of mushrooms; olives; et cetera. After slow cooking this mixture for 8 hours I can honestly say that I have never been so displeased with a recipe in my lifetime. I was not able to serve it as a main dish not only due to the lack of palatable qualities but due to the fact that it absolutely had no presentation qualities. After spending a lot of money to make this dinner I was at least able to salvage some parts of it by taking the contents adding some shredded cheese and creating quesadillas. It is with heartfelt disappointment that I submit this review.",

Here are my modifications: I removed the skin from the thighs but left the bones in - less fat, more flavor. I also used 12 thighs instead of eight (I had a \"bonus buy\" package) and it worked great - I would do it that way again as it yeilded lots of leftovers and there was plenty of saucy stuff to go around. I also used fewer olives than recommended and none of the olive brine from the jar. I will definitely be making this one over and over again!",
