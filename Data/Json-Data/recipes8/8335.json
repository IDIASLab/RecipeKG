Being a true southern girl, butter has always been my go to in a recipe or just eat on something, but Country Crock exceeded my expectations. I will be using it again. This cake was very good. Instead of whipped cream, I had some pumpkin spiced cream cheese left over from another recipe I made recently so I used that on top of it. So good! I also took a little bit of the caramel sauce and put some walnuts on top of a cooling rack and drizzled the caramel on top of my walnuts that I laid on top of the cake. As you can see also, I sprinkle powdered sugar on the top to make it look festive. Thank you for such a great recipe.",
