But for my choice, this is WAY too much for one head of romaine lettuce. I used three and increased the amount of dressing slightly but I wouldn't have needed to. I didn't use it all. That would have definitely been too much dressing for us. I also used the Cilantro Lime Chicken I had previously made from another website. It was a great addition in keeping with the cilantro and lime theme. Tasty! I will definitely make this again.",
