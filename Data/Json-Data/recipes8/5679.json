I was around the house yesterday, so I just let it cook down for about 1-1/2 hours, and left the consistency just a bit chunky.   I did add some fresh tomatoes and fresh oregano which I had on hand.  This was tasty on a pizza, but I can see this as a good base sauce for so many other things just by adding additional herbs and spices.  And even just for something as simple as weeknight  chili macs/goulash by adding some macaroni, ground beef, chili powder, cumin, etc.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, this is a good multi-purpose red sauce, much more than just a pizza sauce.",
