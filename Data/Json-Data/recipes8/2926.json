I think the recipe video is what really inspired me and helped me through the steps. That being said, this is EXCELLENT. Only two things to add to this.....time.....I made this one day and I didn't think it had the flavor I was looking for. After a day in the frig. this sauce developed into a delicious and rich mole. The only other problem that I had was in step 6. The mole in the blender was too thick to blend the added vegetables. So I added the final cup of chicken stock to the blender and it blended easily. I then poured the blended mixture into the pan and added the rest of the ingredients. I was just a bit puzzled by the description of dark chocolate so I added 5 oz. of 80% chocolate with chilis in it. I do think this would work with any good dark (sweetened) chocolate though.The plus is that this makes alot so I am freezing pints of the stuff to pull out when we have a craving for mole. This is fabulous Allrecipes! Thanks for sharing.",

It makes a mole sauce that competes with the best authentic resturants or cooks.  \r\n\r\nMy suggestions: I think too much chicken broth was called for as it is named three times in the recipe but only two cups are actually used?  I just used according to the directions and also actually cut down a bit on the chicken broth at the end to get a thicker sauce.\r\n\r\nOtherwise this was absolutely excellent.  It even beats a brown mole recipe I tried from a professional food site/network (hint, hint). \r\n\r\nThis makes a LOT of sauce, so be prepared to either feed a herd or freeze some.  Which is fine; freezing has no negative effect at all.\r\n\r\nAlso, I used half semi-sweet chocolate and half straight powdered cocoa to make sure I didn't get too much sweet. Doing so made it perfect as the more bitter chocolate I think blended better with the savory tone of the sauce. \r\n\r\nHighly recommend!",

It was so delicious that I decided to create an account and write a review. The flavors are amazing and blend so well together something I have found difficult with other mole recipes I have tried out. I used dried anaheim peppers and jalapenos with the guajillo peppers because I could not find the others listed in the recipe. I also used the mini semi-sweet morsals for the dark chocolate requested. Having a good blender is important because the mixture is quite thick. I agree with the others that the sauce really develops well after a few hours or so of sitting in the refrigerator prior to using. I re-heated it on the stove when ready to use. I used it over pulled pork that was smoked absolutely delicious! My guests all asked for the recipe.",

I'm glad I went with dark chocolate, instead of semi-sweet-two very different flavors. \nOnly prep I changed up was using my hand held immersion blender, gradually adding anything cooked in the skillet, into the pot and blending in each addition. We love authentic Mexican food, which is hard to find in Ohio.  Just another reason to vacation in Mexico:)",
