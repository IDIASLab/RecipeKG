I added fresh italian seasoning that it asked for instead of dried, such as marjoram, thyme, oregano, etc.  I did not add sage since it overpowers foods and so does the rosemary so you have to choose one.  When i cooked the turkey i cooked it breast side down..that is the best secret to having a moist delicous turkey..also cover with foil, if you are not stuffing the turkey throw some rosemary sprigs inside the cavity with whatever vegetables you may choose as well.  The last 45 min. to an hour take the foil off and turn the turkey breast side up so it can brown.",

Yes, I was a sight to behold with apron and long yellow gloves but it got the job done!  I mixed the fresh spices in a salad dressing jar the night before and shook it well to allow the flavors to work into the oil.  That also saved prep time on roasting day and allowed the flavored oil to be easily poured where it was to go.  I started the roast breast side down and tented it with aluminum foil after it browned nicely.  After 2 hours I turned it breast side up and tented it after it browned.  Earlier I pulled the wings away from the body to ensure the area under them browned as well.  I used the oven probe the last hour or two (of slightly more than 4 hours for the 15 pounder) and it was perfect color and moistness at 180 degrees.",

I roasted on 500 for about thirty minutes and then flipped the bird and reduced the heat for the rest of the cooking time. The meat was juicey and delicately infused with all the wonderful herbs and seasonings. Very good Star! Bro came thru with flying colors!!!!:)",
