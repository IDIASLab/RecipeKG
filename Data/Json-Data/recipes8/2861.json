When I bought the tongue at the store he said, \"that's just for you.\"  But after he ate the tacos he said they were the best he's ever had.  I'll tell him what they were made of when I'm done with this:)  I made the tongue just as written, but just made a cold salsa like another reviewer adding lime and cilantro.  I give it a 4 because although the meat was melt in your mouth good, it was missing a little something to me.  Felt a lot like eating a roast beef taco.  I might put a few more spices next time I cook the tongue. Yummy though",
