It's extremely flavorful as well as rich and decadent, but not overly so. Buttery, nutty Gruyere cheese works so well with butternut squash, and a bit of Dijon mustard balances the sweetness and richness of this dish. Pair it with a salad to give a temperature and texture contrast.",

I used frozen pre-cut squash (from Costco), followed the microwave instructions for that. Mashed up the squash from there, seasoned it, and added the ham, cheese, egg, mustard. Topped with extra cheese and baked for about 20 min at 475. Came out great too! I just wanted a way that was a little quicker for week nights. Will for sure make it again both ways.",
