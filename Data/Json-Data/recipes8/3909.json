I like to make it with olive oil for a better flavor and healthier oil option.  Avocado oil or a mix of both works well also.  I make a batch of it and eat it right out of the frig when I need a light healthy snack.  I also served it for guests at a family gathering and had to make copies of the recipe for everyone to take home!  This is also a great way to use up abundant garden zucchini if you are tired of making zucchini bread.",
