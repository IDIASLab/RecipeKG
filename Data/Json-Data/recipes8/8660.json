This is an authentic version. I'm very glad I did it. The term teriyaki comes from of two Japanese words 'teri' and 'yaki'. Teri refers to the shine or luster of the glazed sauce, and yaki means to broil or grill the meat.",

Broiling worked well I used Reynold's non stick foil (love that stuff) but I think actually grilling the chicken would have been even better. Chicken thighs are pretty thin and cook really fast. I didn't get the 'finish' I would have liked using the broiler. Grilling over direct heat and glazing the entire time would have been easier and produced a better glazed finish to the chicken without over cooking it.",
