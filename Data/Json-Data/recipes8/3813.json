I added some hot sauce for a bit of extra heat, I used a large can of diced tomates, I used two green peppers instead of one, I used wild rice instead of brown, and I used chicken instead of shrimp.

The instructions left out that you need to bring your rice mixture to a boil before covering it, turning on low, and simmering for 45 minutes. If you do not bring it to a boil first, this will take more like 2 hours to cook. Even with bringing it to a boil, it takes more like an hour, just like it does when you make brown rice by itself.

Came out WONDERFUL... with a few adjustments... First- ADD GARLIC! 1-2 cloves minced is perfect. I did use white rice as a preference in taste & time- minute rice added (cooked) in when adding shrimp is perfect!!  Can't really place brown rice on this one- jumbalaya is a more hearty dish & brown instead of white rice makes me feel it would not fit well. Due to spice preferences- i also added a wee bit more cayenne & pepper. Adjustments to the salt are definitely as stated! Adjust salt & peppers to taste! You don't want a salty dish (the sausage has enough salt) and you dont want a dish too spicy to eat! Adjust everything to preference. That is key to a great recipe like this. Thanks to Chef John! This is a keeper- just needs adaptation for each cook's preferences. :)",
