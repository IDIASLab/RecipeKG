For muffins, use muffin liners and fill your muffin cups almost all the way as these rise very minimally. Also only bake for about half the time as for loaf or less (30 min). Very moist and flavorful. Perfect level of sweetness. The texture is not like normal quick breads made with grains, it's more moist and grainy (for lack of a better word haha). As long as that is ok with you (aka you're not trying to pass them off as regular muffins), the taste and presentation are great! My husband gave two thumbs up! Definitely will make again!",

I doubled and followed the recipe to the \"T\" with the only exception being I added walnuts and dried cranberries. My bread was completely cooked at 55 minutes. FYI for any other non Paleo person - The consistency of the dough/batter was significantly different then any recipe I have ever made. It resembled something between a batter and a dough and honestly doubted that it would even cook up. But it did and was a HUGE hit for all those Paleo - they commented on how deliciously moist the bread was - my husband and I thought it was quite dry but edible. Can you tell we are not Paleo?",

Line a sheet pan with 3 layers of paper towels.  With a spatula spread the canned pumpkin over the paper towels and top with 3 more layers of paper towels.  You will be amazed at the moisture that is released. AND the pumpkin does not stick to paper towels.\nI also used an extra egg (5). In lieu of Pumpkin Pie Spice: 1-1/2 tsp ground ginger, 3 tsp Vietnamese cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp allspice.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 2T honey.  Enjoy!",
