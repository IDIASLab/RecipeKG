Also, step 2 states that you should cook it for about 5 minutes on med/low heat. When I put the stove on med/low heat (around a 2 on my stove), it was bubbling immediately. So although there were some unclear parts in the recipe, it turned out great and my mom, who is gluten-free, absolutely loved the cake!",
