I use large potatoes and I go with a minimum of one hour. I also use bamboo skewers instead of wooden spoons to keep from cutting all the way through the potatoes. They taste great and, they're good leftover too. I cut them the rest of the way through and throw them in a skillet with sliced onions, jalapenos, and kielbasa for an easy skillet meal or chop them up and make hash browns, scrambled eggs, and bacon.",
