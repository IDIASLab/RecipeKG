I seasoned it to taste with Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up Salt and some Lemon Pepper Seasoning. The paprika wasn't discernible in terms of taste all that much but it did give the potato salad an interesting shot of color. At first I thought it could use a splash of color - radishes maybe or grape tomatoes but as this recipe's first reviewer I wanted to stay relatively true to the recipe. As it turns out I kind of liked the fresh \"green\" look to the salad. As for measurements I just winged it sinced it's hard to know the exact volume of a red potato. Loved the addition of the bacon - I dare ask who wouldn't?",
