Warming the herbs and garlic in the oil prior to tossing with the veggies helps their flavor bloom. When ready to serve, drizzle on as much or as little balsamic vinegar as you like.",

Please take Bibi's suggestion of 'blooming' the herbs in the warm olive oil; it really does make a difference.  She knows her stuff!\n\nI subbed the balsamic vinegar for sherry vinegar just because i ran out of white balsamic that I prefer. I also sprinkled the vinegar over the top after tossing the veggies in the herbed oil and roasting. I also needed to bump up the cook time to 40 minutes due to the added root vegetables.\n\nThank you, Bibi, for another delicious dish, sure to make many more appearances at Myers Manor!",
