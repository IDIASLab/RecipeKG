I found the peanut sauce very diluted/watered down, so if I were to make again, I\u2019d definitely reduce the amount of water.  You\u2019re pretty much relying on the peanut sauce for the flavor on this recipe.  Made it exactly as written, tasted, and then started adding ingredients to make it work for us.   I cut the chicken into 1\u201d pieces, and did not sauce the skewers until the chicken was just about cooked.  If you brush on the sauce too soon, you\u2019ll end up with burned skewers waiting for the chicken to cook.  I bought a bottle of kecap manis for this recipe (not a staple in my pantry), and for any others who aren\u2019t familiar with it,  just wanted to give you a heads up that plain soy sauce is not a good substitution.  Consistency is very thick, and it tastes a bit like molasses IMO.  The chicken was juicy, and with modifications, we enjoyed it, but as written, it would have been a disappointment.",

It was a little too one texture for me so will make it again but will add blanched carrots capsicum and maybe even some cucumber to freshen it up! Also I added an egg - spot on choice.",
