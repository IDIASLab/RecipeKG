Since you can stuff them with about anything grilling squid is a great idea. Next time I will try a couple different kinds of stuffing. If you don't have a piping tube you can cut the top off a soda bottle like I did and push the filling down through. Great idea chef John",

                "reviewBody": "Sorry Chef John but I'm giving this 2 stars.  This is based on the amount of prep time - over an hour, and the grill factor.  It just took too long for the squid filling to get to 155 F. that the squid was over chewy.  The stuffing was very good mixed with rice! I only cooked 10 of the squid  and froze the remainder.  Perhaps I'll try another cooking method like broiling, baking or poach-ing. \nOne tip for those who still want to try this, poke the squid with a skewer once you get them on the grill to let the grease drip out. Otherwise you'll have the stuffing spewing out all over the grill.",
