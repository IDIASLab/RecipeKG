Also skipped the sugar in the wet mixture because I was afraid it would be too sweet for our tastes. My 7 year old said it was the best GF pizza I've made so far.  I used parchment paper on the pan to avoid sticking and only baked at 420 (per needs of paper). Worked great!  Note to the cook who said the dough was gooey. GF doughs aren't like other bread doughs. They can't usually be kneaded and their consistency is usually between cake batter and cookie dough.",

                "reviewBody": "This crust is amazing!  My 5 year old loved it.  I took a taste myself and was very happy with the results.  If you are new to gluten free baking, please note that this crust will NOT be anything like the same consistency of a wheat pizza crust.  As other reviewers have said, it is very gooey.  Don't worry though, because once it is baked, it comes out perfect.  You can't roll this out with a roller.  You have to use your hand to spread it out into the size and shape you want on the cookie sheet.  I took another reviewers advise and put it on parchment paper when I baked them, and they just slid right off when they were done...perfect.  I made 5 small crusts for my kiddo. I baked them for 15 minutes, let them cool, then froze the remaining 4 in a gallon bag with parchment paper between them to prevent them from sticking together.  You definitely want it to bake for ~ 15 minutes before putting the toppings on.  My son is allergic to wheat, dairy, and eggs (among other things) so I had to modify the recipe a bit. I just didn't put any kind of cheese in it and it came out fine.  In place of the egg, I used my old standby of 1 Tbsp of flaxmeal to 3 Tbsp of warm water (this needs to thicken for ~15 minutes before using).  Another option for the egg is Ener-g egg replacer. This is the first time I have made him pizza crusts and I will continue to do so from now on. No more store bought crusts for him.  This recipe is soooo much better.  I think any wheat eating person will eat it!",

Do not add more gf flour it will weigh more like a brick and chew like one too=) If you are having problems spreading it use a little water on your spatula or fingers that should help.",

I had to modify it because I had rice flour and not all purpose gluten free flour and I had gluten free Bisquick mix on hand. I used the Bisquick in place of the all purpose flour omitted the xanthan baking soda and sugar (the mix has it already) and added an extra 1/8 cup each rice flour and tapioca flour to make up for the missing flour. The general recipe and the method are what is important here. This turned out just delicious; it can be as thick or thin as you like to spread it (I like it thick)! My husband was raving and ate 4 pieces before I told him it was gluten free. Remember to spread the batter carefully and bake it almost completely before adding toppings and baking again!",

In order to make it like dough (so you can make it into a ball and roll it) I had to add a TON of extra gluten-free all purpose flour. Then I baked it and it is completely flat and heavy. It did not rise at all. I'm guessing the ingredients are mis-proportioned but I'm not a good enough cook to play around with the recipe to figure out how.",
