I doubled the recipe since it makes such a small batch but I kept the amount of oil the same since it seemed like too much to me. I actually used 1/4 c olive oil and 1/4 c canola oil so the olive oil flavor wasn't so overpowering. I added one tsp of chili powder and about 2 Tblsp of ketchup to thicken it up and balance out the flavor a little bit. It turned out great! Now it's a keeper!",

Will add it to the bland flavorless tacos I sometimes have to get from Taco Hell. KEVINLEE91 you've made my day!",

Since I was using this as an ingredient for another recipe (Chicken Ole from this site) I added a few squirts of ketchup to give it the tomato flavor I would normally expect. (However I did try the sauce without it and thought it was good without the ketchup too.) Additionally I followed the advice of other reviewers to double the spice amounts and use 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup canola oil instead of just the olive oil. Next time I may add a few dashes of chili powder and paprika if I want a more traditional \"taco sauce\" flavor.",
