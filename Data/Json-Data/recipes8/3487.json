Be careful not to overfill the pan, as these will rise and you will be left with something that looks like little bundt cakes. These were not the typical heavy cake donut but a light and fluffy donut. I used powdered sugar on half and chocolate frosting/sprinkles on the other half. I ended up with 18 donuts.",
