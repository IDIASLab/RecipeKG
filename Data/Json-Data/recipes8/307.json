                "reviewBody": "This recipe was pretty good! I did make a few changes: 1. I added less butter to the graham cracker crumbs and then pre-baked it @ 350\u00b0 for about 10 minutes - that made it stay together better for me. 2. I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave before layering on the crust. 3. I added more marshmallows - personal preference because we love them in our house. 4. I crumbled the 2nd layer of graham crackers on top instead of keeping them whole. I just liked how it looked better. Then I baked it all at 350\u00b0 for about 10-20 minutes or until the marshmallows puffed up and had a light brown toasted color to them. So yummy!",

The chocolate chips weren\u2019t fully melted.  I had to broil the top to melt the marshmallows.  It looked great out of the oven, but it was a mess to try to cut and serve.  I think it would be possible to fix the recipe, by actually baking a crust, melting the chips, then putting it under a broiler for a few minutes without the grahams on top.  I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll try this again.  It\u2019s sad to spend time and money on a disappointing recipe.",
