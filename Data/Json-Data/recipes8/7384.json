We opted to replace the deli turkey with thin sliced chicken breast we sprinkled with a bit of Goya- Adobo seasoning (consists of salt granulated garlic oregano & turmeric) and baked in the oven for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Everything else we followed. My very picky family loved it! Not a turkey fan so maybe as a quicker option next time we will try Boar's Head EverRoast Deli Chicken Breast.",
