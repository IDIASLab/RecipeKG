We used the leftover oil on the portobello mushrooms instead of olive oil. There was a ton of filling so don't be afraid to pack it on - the stuffing isn't going to melt and slide off. My husband who loves spinach dip and mushrooms wasn't into this dish until it was done and he did a sample bite. My mushroom became his mushroom. The only other change I made besides using leftover oil is that I omitted the red pepper flakes as the kids don't like them.",

I served this as a main dish w/ a big salad but I think this would be great as a side by omitting the chicken or even as an appetizer in the smaller mushrooms. I did use light Alfredo sauce but that was my only change. Oh also I wasn't sure if the artichokes were supposed to be marinated or not so I used marinated which was great. I will def be making this again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I chopped the artichokes and added them, and then some fresh spinach. Instead of alfredo sauce I used a can of cream of chicken soup. I left out the pepper flakes and wish I had added them. I put the filling in the caps, topped with shredded Italian cheese and bread crumbs, and not having the fancy oven, I baked them at 400F for 15 minutes, then a minute or two under the broiler to brown the topping. Served on a bed of brown rice. Family enjoyed them very much. I thought they were just a little bit ... meh, and could have stood the spark of those pepper flakes. Anyway, saved the recipe for future reference.",
