I did make one sandwich with olive oil instead of the mayo and garlic spread and it was wonderful as well.  Some hints:  You can buy roasted red peppers in the jar at the store which saves a lot of time.  Also, slice the eggplant fairly thick.  I sliced it too thin to start and it stuck to the cookie sheet when I roasted it.  I will make this over and over and over!",

I added fresh herbs (garlic, parsley, sage, oregano, basil, and rosemary) to the bread dough.  For the grilled veggies I used a sliced Portabello mushroom, fresh green pepper, Walla Walla sweet onions, and some frozen red and yellow pepper slices.  The eggplant and mushroom were oven roasted, as described in the recipe, except that I used an olive oil spray (quicker and easier than brushing with oil). The sliced onion and pepper were quickly stir fried in a non-stick pan, also lightly coated with an olive oil spray.  I used low-fat mayo, to round out this healthy and delicious sandwich.  (I was skeptical about whether I'd like grilled eggplant, but found it was fabulous).  Give this sandwich a try, and it will make a believer of you, too!",

I've made it for numerous potluck suppers, this years family reunion table, today's Fourth of July gathering table and for several small lunches for special friends.  It has always been well received and the recipe has been requested again and again.  Thus far, I prepare the sandwich pretty much as written but offer the following notes:\r\n1.  I use a plain, round Focaccia bread.\r\n2. A medium size eggplant is sufficient.\r\n3. I slice the eggplant in rounds instead of strips as the Focaccia I use is round and the rounds of eggplant seem to fit more easily.\r\n4. I use a fat free (not a reduced fat) salad dressing instead of mayonnaise.\r\n",

The only change I would make would be to add fresh spinach leaves between the vegetables and the bread so that the bread doesn't get soggy which ours did in a couple of places. Or else blot the veggies very well with paper towel to soak up any excess moisture. I intend to try this with Feta cheese next time and perhaps add some grilled red onion. This is a wonderful sandwich for a picnic. We will be enjoying it often this summer! Thanks Chris!",

I bought Asiago cheese focaccia from Panera roasted the eggplant and fried up some red onions in olive oil the day before. I bought the roasted red peppers and some fresh mozzarella. Overnight I stored the eggplant onions and peppers in a Tupperware with a paper towel to absorb some of the juices. Then the next morning I flipped the Tupperware upside down to soak up more of the moisture. I prepared these about an hour prior to eating them and did not press them down and they were fine and not at all soggy. As a spread I used store bought refrigerated pesto mixed with mayo as suggested on another review. These were full of flavor. I will make them again and again!",
