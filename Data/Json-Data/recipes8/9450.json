After 50 minutes in the oven, it didn't look quite done , so I left it in another 5 minutes.  It said the center would be a little wobbly, which it was.  I hoped after it cooled it would be fine.   After it cooled, I got the worst surprise...it was NOT DONE IN THE CENTER!!!  What the heck?  I see I'm NOT the only one who had this happen. Maybe it should be baked at 350 or baked longer at 325?",
