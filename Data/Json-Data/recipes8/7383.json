I used mini rotini pasta and I had Roma tomatoes on hand, that was my only substitution. I mixed everything up and let the ingredients marry for about 30 minutes before serving.    The avocado adds a lot of flavor and texture to this salad, so don't be tempted to leave it out.  We thought a little onion would add additional flavor to this salad.  I served this with 'Biscuits with Blue Cheese' from AR and we had a delicious meal.  Thanks, Lane J for sharing your recipe, it is a keeper.",

I only had six slices of bacon, but it was plenty for us, and the avocado was a nice addition also. I'm sure I'll make this one again since we all really liked it.",

The dressing pretty much disappeared into the pasta so I served the rest of it with the meal. Next time I would not dress it ahead of time just so that I could possibly use less.
