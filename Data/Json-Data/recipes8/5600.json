Now, lobster is a treat and costs a fortune.  I've paid over ten dollars for one of these lobster rolls in Cape Cod and it wasn't half as good or half as big as the ones my Mom taught me to make.  This is a wonderful summer (or winter) treat and makes a fancy luncheon to impress your friends.  (And no, I don't eat the green stuff in the lobster!)",

This recipe is FAR better then what Neiman Marcus offers.  SO simple but yet, so delicious.  I brought fresh French bread from the bakery and toasted it prior to dressing the sandwich.  The next time we have lobster I plan on buying too much again, just so that I can have this sandwich the next day!!!",

Instead of using lobster meat I also used immitation crab meat like a previous reviewer posted and also mild green tabasco sauce and it was Outrageous!! The lime gives it a nice flavor. Would also be nice to serve with crackers for get togethers. These will be the only Lobster Rolls I will ever make! Thank You for sharing this recipe :)",

Simmer water, add shrimp then immediatly shut off heat. Cover and let sit for ten minutes, perfect shrimp every time. then shock in ice bath, peal then follow recipe as previously stated.

We bought lobster tails for V-Day that were just too big to eat and I had no idea what to do with the leftovers since I have bad luck reheating lobster. So I tried this recipe since it stays cold. I'm so glad I did! I did make a few changes: I had about a 1/2 Lb. of lobster I used all the mayo (light) I used 1 Tab lemmon not lime I substituted a dash of celery salt becuase I don't like celery I added about 4 dashes more hot pepper sause and I put it in a tortilla with lettuce (and no butter)as a wrap. I can't see myself spending 20 a pound just for this but if I ever have leftover lobster again this is the perfect way to eat it! And if you have a fancy party this would make an unbelievable appitizer.",
