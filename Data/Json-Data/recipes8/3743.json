The cinnamon gets lost. But they are good. I let these cool at least 10 minutes (and they were still hot on bottom) before I put in the refrigerator. I took out after 10 minutes, and they started to crumble when I tried to cut and remove them from the pan. They really need to fully chill for at least an hour to set up. Once they were completely cold, they held up better.",
