First off, the thicker chili makes it really versatile for making awesome chili cheese coneys (don't forget to add mustard and onions), or as a topping for potatoes or loaded french fries. Pro tip: cook the beef just in water for about 20 minutes. Then put it in a bowl and throw in the fridge overnight. This causes all the fat to rise to the top and solidify so you can easily scoop it off with a spoon. Then return to your pot with all the components for a nice slow simmer.  Finally, I like to add a tbs of cocoa powder to the chili while simmering. This city was known for its German heritage but this one is a shout out to our Greek immigrants. Enjoy!",
