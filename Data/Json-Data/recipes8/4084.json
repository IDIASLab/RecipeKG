I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than recommended, but no big deal.  I was scared when I took this out of the oven because it rose unevenly; however, it leveled out quickly while cooling.  Great item to take to a brunch...loved it!!!",

The sun dried tomatoes are what gives this the taste... so don't leave them out. Adding meat with this would work great but I think I would leave the cheese level as it is",
