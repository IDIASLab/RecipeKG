                "reviewBody": "Being the submitter of this recipe.  I noticed changes that were made after it was published (not my me)  1) the tomato sauce has been cut way back.  I use about 29 ounces, because I make extra for serving after it is plated, as it gets kind of dry the tortillas suck up the sauce.  2) It is Very important to use Gebhardt chili powder because it is very mild tasting and not as spicy and strong as the generic chili powders you buy at the grocery stores.  If you are using a different chili powder you will need to cut it WAY down.  1/8 cup to 1/4 cup to taste. once the sauce is warmed you can taste it.  3) the water is to be whisked into the chili powder just enough water to make it the same consistency as the sauce so that it mixes in better and doesn't clump.  One last tip I would give is to put the extra sauce in a condiment container such as the squeeze ketchup or mustard bottles.  that way you can squirt it over your plated casserole.",

I would recommend using the firmest corn tortillas possible- I used very soft fresh ones and they disintegrated in the casserole. It still tasted great but was texturally off a bit.
