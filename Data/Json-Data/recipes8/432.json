I followed the crust recipe exactly and it was too dry and did not \"come away from bowl\" as described. The thyme in crust was a nice touch! \n2) 30 min prep was not enough  3) I doubled the Blackberry filling-  it's too delicious not to have more. 4) Filling is great, but I think some lemon juice and/or lemon juice, added, would greatly improve recipe.  \nI will make again, but not this crust recipe/ method. Will try with 1.5 cups flour",
