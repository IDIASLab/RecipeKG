I used the Fajita Seasoning recipe on this site, and I didn\u2019t weigh it out, just sprinkled it on the veggies.  May have been a bit heavy-handed, but they still tasted really good.  The lemon-pepper added a nice flavoring to the shrimp, and everything cooked up perfectly in 30 minutes (no overcooked, rubbery shrimp).  And since I\u2019d lined my baking sheet with foil, clean-up was a breeze.  The tortillas ended up a bit soggy, but that\u2019s an easy fix.  I actually have a tortilla warmer, don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t use it.  We thoroughly enjoyed this, and my husband\u2019s comment was \u201cwe don\u2019t need to forget about this one, it\u2019s good.\u201d  Served with some Cuban black beans and rice, sour cream, and hot pickled peppers.  This recipe takes very little effort, it\u2019s delicious, and it\u2019ll be made again.",
