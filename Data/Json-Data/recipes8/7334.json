I always leave the skins on for red potato salads for a little bit of added color and flavor. I used light sour cream and Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix. I mixed everything together and let it chill for a few hours and prettied it up with some additional thin sliced green onion on top. I might try this with bleu cheese next time for something a little different. Overall, very good - thanks for a great recipe KristenB!",
