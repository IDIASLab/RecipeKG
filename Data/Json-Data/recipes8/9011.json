Pull the skin and meat around the stuffing, to join at the original backbone cut, completely enclosing the stuffing and recreating the shape of the turkey. Sew or lace the back of the turkey up with kitchen twine and a large needle or skewers. Rub the entire outside of the stuffed turkey with olive oil.

I also used apricots and prunes which were a great addition and flavour booster. Threw in some Port wine with cider AND used fresh sage because it pairs well with celery. Also used Italian Pannetone bread however I think that any good fruit bread will do the trick. If you use good day-old rustic Italian bread just throw in more fruit. I also threw in some Port wine!!! This recipe is flexible and NOT difficult yet delivers great flavour. Don't be too concerned about using the \"exact\" measurements...go with your heart on this one!!",
