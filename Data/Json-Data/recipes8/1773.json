I followed this recipe closely, only substituting cake flour for the all-purpose flour. It came out perfectly! I made a black cherry compote & spread that between the layers, then frosted with a store-bought buttercream frosting. The cake was moist, flavorful, & fluffy. Loved it!",

Then I realized the fact that we live at 9,350 feet above sea level might be to blame.  I found this recipe and tried it three hours before guests arrived.  It turned out great!  Flat, no sunken middle, no overflowing batter.  The guests raved about it.  I think the coffee helps enrich the flavor.  The only adjustments I made were to use vanilla flavored Greek yogurt and to bake it in an approximately 9x13-inch cake pan.  I topped the cake with vanilla buttercream icing and diced strawberries.  Thank you for this great high-altitude recipe!",
