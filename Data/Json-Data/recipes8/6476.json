Trim the fat and cut them into 1\" strips save the remains for a decadent treat. Pound the meat flat as directed for wrapping. Microwave the asparagus (big fat stalks) 2 minutes twice not 4 minutes or it will get mushy. Use your favorite meat rub on the steak then Wrap the meat and peppers as directed. Broil 5 minutes each side for medium rare on most pieces. Try to convince yourself you are not at a fancy restaurant while you eat it.",

The only change I made (besides forgetting the add'l cheese) was to use my own roasted peppers which I had in the freezer in olive oil garlic and basil. These are elegant enough to serve for a dinner party but easy enough for a weeknight meal. We served ours with some pan fried potatoes and sliced tomatoes. It was a fantastic Saturday night dinner at home for a lot less than going out! Thanks LilSnoo!",

They fell apart a bit when I flipped them (as I broiled them in my oven for 5 min a side) but they came out delicious. I think hubby ate 9 of them! I also just had powdered parmesan but I tucked in a small strip of provolone. Easy tasty & quick... all my favorite things.",
