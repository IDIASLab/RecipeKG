Next time I would put my potatoes in a little ahead of time only because we like them nice and brown. Also recommend drizzling the melted butter on top of the corn (thawed) once it is on the pan because you simply cannot mix melted butter with cold corn, it becomes a corn ball.  I wasn\u2019t crazy about the mayo, Dijon and honey blend but that could simply be a difference in taste preferences so I would greatly recommend others do this as written.  Actually I would encourage anyone looking at this recipe to give it a try, it is worth it. Will definitely be doing this again just changing the chicken dip.   Thanks for the recipe.",
