I'm not vegan either but just loved the healthiness of this recipe. In stead of stevia I used 1cup organic brown sugar corn starch for tapioca start canola oil for coco oil. With the chia I used 1/2cup coco milk and 1/2 cup water. Added 1/2 cup shredded coco extra. Pecans for walnuts. Regular flour for cashew flour. Finely chopped apples instead of apple sauce. Turned out really good. it made 16 muffins instead of 12. Next time might add chocolate chips! Thanks for submitting!",

For chia I used flax seeds; tapioca - 1tbs brown rice flour; liquid stevia - 3tsp sweet leaf organic stevia sweetener. I also added some nutmeg and vanilla as I like spices.  I am pleased with the overall outcome. So thanks for sharing your recipe.",
