I went over the ingredients many times and could not figure out why my sauce was not red like the photo shows in the Allrecipes Magazine? My color was much lighter.  It was a very filling meal. I served broccoli on the side which actually worked fine. Not a low calorie meal , but it was fun to try something very different.",
