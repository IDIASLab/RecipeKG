I had a bunch of veggies in my fridge that I knew wouldn't be used quickly enough before they spoiled so I tossed in broccoli, mushrooms, green onions, and grape tomatoes. Sauteed everything except tomatoes in a pan before mixing with ricotta cheese and eggs. Instead of parmesan I used a Mexican blend of 4 cheeses I had leftover from a taco dinner. Added cayenne and nutmeg to the other spices. Sprinkled more cheese on top and baked for 30 mins. I might have baked it a few minutes too long because it was a little dry but it was definitely a nice change from same old boring eggs and toast breakfast! Next time I might add some garlic, green peppers and potatoes. Would also be great with some bacon or sausage in there too. The possibilities are endless!",

Def gonna make this again but with more bacon and half the spinach (whole pkg was spinach overload, and this is coming from someone who loves spinach) **update** after making this 3 different times, the secret seems to be bacon, and some chopped up fresh spinach (not frozen). I forgot to get bacon last time and it turned out too dry with just egg/spinach/sauteed mushrooms. Sauteeing the shrooms was overkill and botched the flavor as well. Cook a bunch of bacon, then chop it and use lots of cheddar cheese for best taste.",
