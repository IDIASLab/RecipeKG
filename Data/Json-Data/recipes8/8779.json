I cooked this in my Dutch oven on the stove top for about 45 minutes or until the squash was tender.   This turned out to be very good!  The spice blend  works beautifully.  I served this with homemade whole wheat dinner rolls.  p.s.  for those who change the recipe then give it three or four stars that isn't fair.  I feel that you should rate the recipe as written.",

My chicken thighs had the bones in them and I took off their skin. I question the amount of pressure cooking at 3 minutes. I compared instapot cooking times for chicken thighs and decided on 11 minutes. I worked all the other times and pressure cooking instructions from this recipe. My chicken was done but my squash was mushy. It didn't effect the taste. I will definitely make this again.",
