For an 11 lbs unstuffed turkey, it took 4 hours, and it was still iffy by the bone. \nI will start my next one at 400 F, breast down for 1 hour. Then flip it breast side up, reduce temp to 325 F for 2 more hours. \nThis is my tried and true method, and the meat literally falls off the bone. \nLooking forward to combining these recipes. Yum!",
