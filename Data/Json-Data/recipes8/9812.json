Made these twice, once with black bananas and once with somewhat less ripe ones.  The first was intensely banana flavored, the second much milder.  Also, I divided the batter into 2 rounds and scored each into 6 pieces using a pizza knife (not the rolling kind!). Parchment worked in place of the Silpat. I'll keep making these, but I'll wait for black bananas from now on.",
