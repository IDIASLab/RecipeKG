Other people brought up the fact that this recipe calls for baking powder when other peanut brittle recipes usually call for baking soda maybe that's why it didn't turn out? I'm tempted to try it again but with baking soda to see what happens. Also noticed the under side of the \"concoction\" is EXTREMELY sugary as if all the sugar settled there. Not like normal brittle at all.",
