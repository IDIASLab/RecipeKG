This has a nice combo of ingredients with many layers of flavor:  the sweetness of the melon, the saltiness of the olives and the feta, the tartness of the lime, the crunch of the red onions, and the zing of that fresh mint.

Also to take the sharpness out of the onion, I marinate the onions in some lime juice  for an hour (while I'm cutting up everything else), then just pour them in with the rest.  It softens them and takes the bite down a notch.  The olives sound strange, but at least try it once with them in - it works!",
