It needs a kick to it. Don't use that awful processed cheese food! Too much fat imitation everything. Not worth buying. Use either a Mexican blend (there are low fat blends) or grate some cheddar and jack. There is a pepper jack cheese that is wonderful in this and don't use a pound of cheese in it. Way too much!
