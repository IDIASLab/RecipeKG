I was happy with the flavor and the juicy, tender meat, and my husband thought it was delicious.\n\nI was a bit concerned that there wouldn't be enough liquid (the pressure cooker requires at least a cup) with only 1/4 cup of broth plus the can of tomatoes, so I added extra broth.  It probably wasn't necessary, and came out a bit soupy, so next time I won't.  I will certainly be making this again.",
