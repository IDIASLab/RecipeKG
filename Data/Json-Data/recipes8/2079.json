I have to say...I wish I would have tried it sooner! So good and easy to make! I used my little battery-powered hand-held  milk frother and the foam was perfectly creamy and airy.  What I like about this recipe is the ratio of water/coffee/sugar.  The other recipes I've seen all call for double the sugar, which would be way too sweet for me. This one is a winner!",

                "reviewBody": "Yoly, thank you for this recipe. I am one of those \u201cobsessed \u201cwith whipped coffee.  Whipping the instant coffee, sugar, and boiling water is such an unbelievably easy way to make an impressive coffee.  I have tried several variations. Almond milk, coconut milk, whole milk, skim milk. I prefer very cold milk and no ice cubes. I have tried with hot milk, but the foam melts down quickly. I have used decaffeinated instant coffee, Swerve, and Splenda  with good results.  As the other reviewer commented, I have better success with a hand mixer as the beaters incorporate the air much more efficiently. Depending on my ratio of coffee, boiling water, and sweetener, I whip for 1 -2 minutes. I personally like the coffee foam to be very strong, so I use equal parts instant coffee, sweetener, and water.",
