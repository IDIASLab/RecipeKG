In the recipes defense, I did not use the inside of a vanilla bean for the vanilla part as the bean I had  did not smell right to me when I cut it open.  So I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead (no almond extract).   There was very little vanilla taste to the cake.  I used the size loaf pan stated in the recipe (glass corningware) but during the baking process, liquid oozed out of the pan onto the oven floor.  This was a medium sized mess.  I'm not sure why it happened  - was it because I added that bit of extra vanilla liquid, was the cheese too wet?  Next time, I would definately put a tray under the pan to catch any drips.   I really wanted to like this cake and have it with fresh strawberries but it's just not the ticket for me .",
