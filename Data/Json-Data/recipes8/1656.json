Also only had unsweetened almond milk, so I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the mix.  Lastly, I  added 1 tbsp of butter.  I never mix my berries into the batter.  I lay out the pancakes on the griddle and add the berries on top before I flip them.  This allows you to get more berries and makes it even in each pancake.  I got 9 pancakes from this and used probably 1 1/2 cups of blueberries.  The batter is very thick, but they are surprisingly light in taste.  Amazing!",
