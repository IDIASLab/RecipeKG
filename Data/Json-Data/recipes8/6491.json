From previous smoking experience he kept the temperature between 250-260 and it still took 7 hours. Not all pork butts are created equal but I do recommend bumping the temperature up on your smoker. With that being said this turned out great. It was super flavorful and stayed tender and juicy.",

We used all applewood for our smoke and I have nothing but good things to say about the pork we pulled out of the pit!  We used smoked paprika which added another layer of flavor to the rub (plus it was what we had in the pantry, lol).\n\nPro-tips for those new to smoking: put a heat safe pan under the pork butt to catch all the amazing juices that drip off.  You can put a small amount of the drippings back into the pork after you\u2019ve pulled it to add to the artery clogging goodness you\u2019ve slaved over.  We use the aluminum pans you see at backyard grill outs all the time so we can just pitch the tin when we are done.  It will definitely be hot immediately after grilling, so here's your obligatory \u201cbe smart when removing, use gloves\u201d disclaimer.",
