I like to use all pork for my city chicken; however tradition is to use pork and veal combined.  The grocery stores around me sell a pack of cubed pork with the wood skewers already in the pack  specifically for city chicken, so you may want to look for that first.  But, if you can't find that, then cubing your own pork will work fine.",

Couple slight changes:  I did a Flour, Egg, Bread crumb dip instead of double bread crumb bc double bread crumb in my experiance just falls off. :)  I also used seasoned bread crumbs and added about 1 tbls of Paprika.  It gave a beautiful color and body to the flavor.  I breaded all my meat first then loaded on skewers this way everything got covered evenly instead of missing some.  Soak your skewers for 20 min before loading them up to prevent them from burning.  Thank you for recipie!!!",
