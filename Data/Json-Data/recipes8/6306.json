My cutter was 1-1/2\" (smallest I had) so not that much bigger than the 1\" called for in the recipe. I used reduced fat cream cheese but the next time I make these I'm going to try light Cool Whip instead of heavy whipping cream to try to get the nutritional breakdown a little healthier. I did add a couple drops of red food coloring to give the dip some eye appeal. Would make a pretty dessert plate for a dinner or a buffet table and it all can be made in advance...yay!",

I only made the dip not the shortcake part of this recipe so I can't comment on that part but the dip is amazing. I made it exactly as written but thought it needed a bit more flavor so I added some more of the confectioner's sugar and an additional big glob of the strawberry jam. Perfect!! Strangely enough one of my favorite fruits to eat with this dip (aside from strawberries and bananas) was the watermelon. Together they created a totally new flavor.",
