I use this with grilled herb pork tenderloin served on cornmeal biscuits for special appetizer occasions. Garnish with additional chopped green onions, if desired. If you want more heat in the chutney, keep some of the jalapeno seeds and ribs as you chop.",

I didn't have jalape\u00f1o but did have a can of diced green chiles so used those instead. I also didn't have onion. My family loved it. A little sweet and a little spicy. My daughter put some on a Graham cracker for dessert and that was tasty too. Enjoy!",
