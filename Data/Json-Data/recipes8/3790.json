Since it was so thick, I didn't add the saltines, making it a good low carb option.  I did not cook the onions ahead of time, I just threw everything together.  I thought it was delicious  I had intended to make hollandaise sauce to go with it, but forgot about that.  It did not need it.  Love the flavor of the artichokes.",
