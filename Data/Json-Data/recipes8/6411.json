We put them on the grill for 2 hours with a watchful eye then moved them to the oven at approximately 250degrees for another 2 and 1/2 hours wrapped in foil. We finished them on the BBQ after putting the sauce on. Bueno!! Tender tasty moist. Can t wait to do it again on a nice day where the weather stays consistent.",

The ingredients melded together so well for a wonderfully sweet BBQ sauce. The only thing I did differently was I cooked mine in the oven low and slow for several hours in foil then opened up the foil and slathered on my sauce baking about 10 minutes between sauce applications. To replace the apple wood chip flavor I marinated my ribs with ingredients listed plus added a little diced onion and homemade applesauce overnight before baking. Turned out great!!! I will be making this again in the future. Thanks for a great recipe! I'll be making and using this sauce on other meats as well. Yeah it's that darn good!",
