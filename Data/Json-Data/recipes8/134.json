My bananas were VERY ripe, and VERY sweet, so I felt comfortable in reducing the sugar amount by half.  Trying to watch my sugar these days, so I substituted Truvia\u00ae Baking Blend for the sugar which gave us just about the perfect level of sweetness (personal taste).  I used three 3-1/2\u201dx6\u201d loaf pans and baked at 350\u00baF for 35 minutes.  I love these small loaf pans for portion control more than anything else.  They work great because it keeps us from totally pigging out when something tastes good, like this recipe.  They baked up moist, tender, loaded with flavor,  and oh yeah, those soft chocolate chips (don\u2019t skip them) accented the banana flavor oh-so-well.   Just Emily, thanks for sharing your recipe, this one\u2019s a keeper.",
