We decided to strain this drink though - it made it a lot smoother and got rid of any extra watermelon seeds. I think this drink would have been too chunky if we hadn't strained it. Also - I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup a batch and it was still a bit sweet. Taste your berries and your watermelon before you decide on how much sugar to add - if they're sweet you might need much at all.",
