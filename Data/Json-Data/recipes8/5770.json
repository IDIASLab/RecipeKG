I love berries and yogurt so this was right up my alley and the lemon and blueberry flavors complimented each other nicely. I used a low fat lemon flavored greek yogurt and added a little lemon zest to pretty it up a bit. You could easily sub wheat germ or granola for the graham crackers. This is a light and refreshing treat for any time of day that you don't have to feel guillty about! Thanks for a great recipe Linda (LMT)!",

The flavors complement one another extremely well. I think it would also be good with pecans to add a little protein but I haven't tried this yet. Thank you for posting this great idea!",
