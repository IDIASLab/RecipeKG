I did use the chicken stove top stuffing mixture and added diced onion, ground sage, and celery to it.  I seasoned the chops with garlic powder, onion salt, ground sage, and pepper. I stuffed the pork chops and placed them in a pan with a rack to keep them from getting soggy. I covered the chops with foil in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes, then took off the foil to brown the chops for another 20-30 minutes. They turned out delicious!",
