        "description": "The flavor for this recipe comes mainly from the spice rub I put on the meat at the start. The spices and their aromas just get locked into the beef and release during the stewing so each bite is really well flavored. I used a spice mix commonly used in Middle Eastern and Moroccan cooking called ras el hanout. The sauce is tart from the tomatoes and sweet from the pumpkin, carrots, and parsnips and has a heady aroma from the spices. Ladle into your favorite soup bowl and slurp away. This is hearty enough on its own so I usually don't serve any bread with it.",
