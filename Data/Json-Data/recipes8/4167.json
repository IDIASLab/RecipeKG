I'm not sure if that's just how it is or if I needed to cook it longer. \nI loved the flavors of the pesto and dried tomatoes, and the red pepper I used instead of the green one! \nThe things I would do differently next time would be to cook the broccoli and peppers ahead of time so they're softer. I don't particularly like crunchy vegetables, and the recipe didn't say to cook them ahead of time, so I just threw them in with the chicken and squash raw. To even get them to soften I had to cook everything with the cover on for about 15 minutes.  \nAnyway, my family liked it well enough, but next time I want to have less crunchy veggies!",
