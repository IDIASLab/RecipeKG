                "reviewBody": "This was yummy, but I would recommend a couple things. Use heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. Or, condensed canned milk if you want a lighter dish.  In India they never use half and half. For the \"cooking oil,\" use vegetable oil. For the butter, you can make \"ghee,\" which is cooked butter with removed fat. You cook the butter in a pan, and when you see the white coagulation on the top, strain the melted butter through a cheesecloth. You will have the golden goodness of the butter without the other stuff. It tastes nutty and flavorful, and if you're wondering what this stuff is - it's what you get with lobster at a good restaurant! You'll have to use a bit more butter (I use a pound) if you're going to make ghee. A lot will be removed in the straining process. Also, \"tomato sauce\" may be confusing. Don't use the stuff you use for pasta! (but that might be a big DUH). Use a can of pure tomatoes, diced or whole. Use the juice! And, one more thing. I tend to like more sauce with my rice and meat (I like to slurp it up with garlic naan and jasmine rice!) If you're like me, you'll want to use more heavy cream and yogurt. This will mean a pinch more of spices (careful with the chili powder!) Another tip - add yogurt to the dish slowly, so the rest of the sauce will \"accept\" it... the yogurt will curdle if too much is added at once. Happy eating!",

The only substitution I made was using a tsp of frozen fenugreek leaves instead of dried, but I don't think that hurt it too much. Don't be deterred if you can't find the fenugreek leaves at all...I'm sure it's fine even without them. Will definitely be making this again for many years to come. Thanks so much for submitting this recipe! PS. One small note, if the chicken releases some water when initially browning it, dump it out of the pan before heating the remaining oil and browning the onions.",

Next time I'll probably add less salt (1/2-3/4 t), and less Indian chili powder (1/8 t) so it's not quite as spicy. I used a combo of condensed milk and half & half and it turned out nicely. I ended up adding extra half & half just to balance out the salt and heat. But we loved this meal served over jasmine rice!",

I actually did this for my extended family around Christmas and even for my grandparents whose palettes aren't particularly adventurous they really enjoyed this meal. yummy! I have also added spinach at the last minute and it was a nice flavour as well with a bit more nutrition:)",

I also doubled the garlic/onion/ginger paste, tomatoes and evaporated milk because I wanted double the amount of sauce.  I cooked some mushrooms in the extra sauce and it was delicious.
