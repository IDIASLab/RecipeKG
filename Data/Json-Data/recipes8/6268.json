I used pork tenderloin and marinated for about 8 hours.  I often find that marinades with soy sauce end up with the meat tasting just like soy sauce, but that wasn\u2019t the case here.  I used pork tenderloin, and the pork flavor was the star.  My pork cubes were about 1-1/2\u201d to 2\u201d, they were grilled for a total of 6 minutes, and they ended up slightly overdone.  In the future, I\u2019m thinking probably 4-5 minutes max to get that nice pink color and tender pork.  Regardless, they still were devoured!",
