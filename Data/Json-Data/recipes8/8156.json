        "description": "I searched high and low for an authentic Jamaican oxtail recipe. It will almost remind Americans of beef stew. I've spent days watching Jamaican cooking videos and international cooks; I wanted to identify what ingredients and techniques were mostly consistent across the board. This recipe is as authentic as it gets, next to being in Jamaica. Be sure to use all fresh veggies and feel free to adjust to your own spice levels. Enjoy with saffron rice or rice and peas. It's rich in flavor, texture, and taste. The meat should literally fall off the bone. So good luck and enjoy!",
