I don t know if this is a well-known thing or if it was just my oven but I learned that I absolutely need to put the pan on the bottom rack. With my first batch I put the pan on the second to bottom rack and nothing happened for the first 20 minutes. Only when I transferred the pan to the bottom rack for an additional ten minutes did the doughnuts rise. They tasted pretty good but were not super fluffy. For the second batch I baked on the bottom rack for 17 minutes and they were delicious moist and fluffy. 10 minutes was not even close to enough but I used s regular-size doughnut pan. The doughnuts themselves are tasty but fairly understated so the cinnamon sugar topping isn t egregious. Bake on the bottom rack and enjoy!",
