I've tried many different recipes and finally came up with one that I love, and I hope you all love it, too! It tastes great plain or topped with whipped cream, chocolate ganache, fruits, and more - the options are endless. Happy baking!",

I used chopped pecans, but put them in the food processor anyway and chopped until the pieces were pretty small, but not floury. I placed cupcake liners in the muffin pans and patted down the crust mixture into the bottom of the liner. I probably used a little less than a tablespoon per liner. There was plenty to make 24 individual cheesecakes. I cooked them at the same temperature, but added a few minutes to the time. For the cheesecake part I used the old recipe that has vanilla wafers as a crust except I used half a teaspoon vanilla and half a teaspoon lemon extract (got the idea from this recipe). I also used dairy free cream cheese. People could not believe that it was a gluten free, dairy free dessert because it was so good.",
