                "reviewBody": "3.9.19 I used the grinder attachment with coarse blade on my KA stand mixer. I make a lot of turkey sausage and honestly I couldn t tell much difference between the ground turkey and ground chicken thigh ingredient in sausage. And that s not to say that we didn t enjoy this because we did. Made this recipe as written with the exception of using fennel seed for the anise seed (did an internet search for subs) and as always added a few red pepper flakes (personal taste preference). The recipe says chopped apple but I d recommend small pieces so think minced. That apple does bring some moistness to the fairly lean chicken mixture (even thighs) and lends just a bit of sweetness as well. I did add a bit of oil to the skillet because I wanted to get some color on the patties. The real trick with any kind of poultry sausage is to get it cooked BUT not overcooked (it ll be bone dry) so do use a meat thermometer as suggested. I ve made a good number of turkey sausage recipes and in particular there s one on this site I really like. I will say that with grinding the meat and pre-cooking the veggies and spices this was more work than any of the other recipes I ve made and that s probably the downside. On the positive side it does taste good and different. I can see myself making it again but I ll most likely just buy readily-available ground turkey. This made some tasty sausage biscuits this morning. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
