I also started cooking the onions a bit before the mushrooms so they could render a bit more to release more flavor.  Such a quick quick and tasty dinner. This is definitely a keeper recipe and I will be making it again!!",

The only change I did was to add a pinch of nutmeg instead of the cayenne pepper, because I can not eat cayenne level spicy hot. Nutmeg gives a specially warm touch to Alfredo sauce. Will absolutely make it again!",
