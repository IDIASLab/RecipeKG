That thought flew out the window when I tasted them with the (mayonnaise-free, THANK YOU!) remoulade!  Wow! What a great combination of flavors - this sauce is totally addicting, and perfectly suited for fried green tomatoes.  I cannot wait to have the opportunity to serve this to guests. It looks and tastes delicious, and was actually quite easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing!",
