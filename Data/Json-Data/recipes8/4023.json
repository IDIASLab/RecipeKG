So happy to think we will be able to make this more often!:) Now I just have to make the biscuits...another night! My gravy the last time turned out terrible because I used wayyy to much gf flour. You don't need very much flour for gravy like you would regular flour. So I know now less is much better with gf flour!!! Thank you very much for this recipe!",
