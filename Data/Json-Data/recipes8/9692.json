If this looks like it's going to be super hard and complicated, that's good-that's exactly what we want people to think. It'll be our little secret how simple and easy this technique is. Although it's great with a dark chocolate filling, this is really a technique recipe and video-this will work with just about any filling you can think of, like dried fruit, jams, custard, or go savory with cheese, meats, etc.",

I don\u2019t have a stand mixer so I used the dough hook attachments of my handheld mixer to combine the milk, yeast, egg, softened butter, and water roux first before slowly mixing in the dry ingredients until it was clumped enough for me to hand knead it. I hand kneaded the dough for 5 minutes and followed the rest of the instructions (except for the fact that I had to cram the 5th roll in the middle of my cake pan bc my cake pan was not 10 inches) My oven runs a little hotter so my bread was fully cooked and brown on top at 25 minutes. I do think the recipe could use a tad more sugar but maybe that\u2019s just my sweet tooth speaking lol",
