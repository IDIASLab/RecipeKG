It relies on potatoes and aromatics breaking down during the cook to form a rich gravy for tender meat and delightful mushrooms. If you want to add a thickener, use the optional directions for cornstarch. We liked it over wide egg noodles, but it would also work on top of rice or mashed potatoes. My guys liked it, so I guess it is a man-pleaser!",
