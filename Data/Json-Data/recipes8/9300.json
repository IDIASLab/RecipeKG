My only changes were to use regular fettuccine instead of whole wheat spaghetti, frozen mixed vegetables instead of peas and carrots (it's what I had on hand), and no lemon zest at the end.  I prefer a little more garlic and black  pepper, as well as more vegetables, but the recipe as written is great.  I ended up eating two servings, which is fine with such a low calorie count.",
