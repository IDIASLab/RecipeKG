I didn't have stuffing mix but just cubed half a loaf of bread, tossed in some seasoning, and called it good.  Worked well, and it is relatively easy for all the steps.  I thought it was pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe.",

Because it's a tiny bit time consuming to make,  we only make it for Christmas, hence the original  name.  Over the years,  I've tweaked the recipe a tiny bit for my household.   I also add a small can of mushrooms, a tablespoon of minced garlic to the bacon/egg  mixture.    You can use bread crumbs instead of Stuffing mix for the topping,  but the flavor is compromised a bit, in my opinion.   I make this up to a month in advance & freeze it until Christmas morning.   I start baking it when the family is up & it's typically cooked & heated throughout & ready to eat by the time gifts are done being unwrapped.   Hope you enjoy our families Christmas Casserole!",

Essentially your end result is cheesy scrambled eggs with bacon and croutons, which could be much more easily achieved than the way it's done in this casserole. Don't get me wrong, it tasted okay. I just wasn't wowed after all the putzing. I guess for Christmas it'd be nice to have a dish ready to go in the oven without having to dirty the dishes but it's too much work for Christmas Eve.
