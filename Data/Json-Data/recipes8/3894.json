I only had a 9\" glass pie plate (rather than 8\" as the recipe calls for) and it worked perfectly. You get a crisp/gooey crust and a sticky, moist inside. Note that the top will sort of collapse and crack as the cake cools. This is normal and authentic! Also, you must let it cool completely or it will just seem runny. Most importantly, for those of you who felt the cake was too liquid: it is all about how you mix the batter. Beat the egg/sugar mixture for a good 5 mns with an electric beater. But stir just a little with a spoon when you mix in the flour mixture and the butter. A total of 30 strokes should do it and it should be by hand. This way, you'll get just the right consistency. Awesome with a bit of freshly whipped cream and a cup of coffee.",

Then I thought I would just snag a small piece of the crust of 1/8th, and then the fork was in there, and now the bowl is out cause I need to make another one so there will be something when the kids get home!  I used a 9\" light coloured cake pan and sprayed with cooking spray.  No problem at all.  Also cut back on the sugar to 1 cup (to make it a diet cake of course)  :) and it is wonderful.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!! I'm thinking those that did have a problem have most likely over stirred.  Important to just gently rotate with a fork, no electric mixer!!  These are very much like making brownies, so just a little stir to mix will do ya!  Happy baking all!  Lorrie",

I made this on a whim needing something for a last minute dessert when time got away from me and I no longer had enough of it left to make what I originally planned. Thanks to AR and its reviews I came across this recipe and was instantly sold. And what a big pay-off for the little time and effort I put into it. It s REALLY gooey when it s warm and granted it does cut more neatly when it s cold but it s sooo much better warm! Reminiscent of a molten chocolate lava cake but in addition to the creamy gooey oozing middle you have a very delicious light crispy almost chocolate wafer-like crust. This was an enormous hit with the boys at the dinner table tonight. They couldn t have cared less I m sure but in addition to a good plotch of whipped cream I prettied it up with fresh red raspberries and the ubiquitous sprig of fresh mint.",

Plus we are big choclate fans. I followed the rest of this recipe exactly. And it turned out beautifully. I did serve it slightly warm though and it had the texture of a starbucks cake with the gooey center. After it was completely cooled it had the texture of a cross between fudge and brownie. Brownie on the outer edges and fudge on the inside. Overall a definite keeper it is going into my recipe book!! We had this for Valentine's day and we decorated the top with a little whip cream and peppermint candy on top. Since it was warm the peppermints melted slightly and added a nice flavor to the cake.:)",

Don't hold back on the pinch of salt as it complements the sweetness beautifully. You can also lightly coat the greased form with a mix of bread crumbs and a tiny pinch of salt before you pour the mix for added texture and flavor. 350 degrees at 30 minutes also works well for those that want to bake it at a higher internal temperature.",

Although I am part Swedish I was not familiar with this recipe. I am glad that I came across it when I was researching Swedish recipes. Very quick and easy.I beat the eggs and sugar for 5 minutes as suggested by another reviewer. I used a buttered 7\" glass pie plate and baked it for 30-35 minutes. Be sure to bake on the bottom rack of oven to avoid it from becoming too overdone on top. Wonderful topped with cool whip and drizzled with melted chocolate chips. Best served warm. It has become a part of my favorite recipe collection. Yummy!!!",
