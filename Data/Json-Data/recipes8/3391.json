I followed the instructions exactly and ended up with cookies that wouldn't cook all the way through without burning (too much shortening in the recipe) and WAY too much of the sugar/nut/rose water mixture. I could have cut that part in half and still had too much. There wasn't enough rose water included to even taste it in the finished cookie. I recommend finding another recipe with better measurements.",

I've searched the internet and there are some others that I think the dough would accomplish that. At the point where it says to add the hot water I would do so gradually. I added the whole cup and the dough was too soft. It also says to let the dough sit. It probably should say to put it in the frig to stiffen it. Could be a great recipe with those kind of changes.",

Is there supposed to be all-purpose too? There are different grinds of semolina. I used the finer grind that I use for Basboosa and ghroobah but this was unedible.
