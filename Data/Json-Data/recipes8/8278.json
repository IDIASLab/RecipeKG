For vegetarians or those avoiding pork, omit the bacon and use canned vegetarian beans - it will still taste delicious! I do have a problem with 2 cups of brown sugar - that's way, way too much for me; I start with Bush's Homestyle Baked Beans, which are already sweet, and add 2-4 tablespoons of brown sugar. I also think 1 cup of chili sauce is plenty. I saute the onion briefly, in a bit of bacon fat or canola oil. This is now our favorite baked bean dish!",

The dinner was fabulous and everybody went back for seconds on the beans.  After reading reviewer comments, the problem with the \"soupy\" beans is because most people used Bush's Baked Beans.  Although Bush's Baked Beans are great on their own directly from the can, the consistency of Bush's is already semi-soupy, (which is why some reviewers \u201cdrained\u201d their beans first) so by adding all the ingredients listed, your end result is very soupy.  Also Bush's beans are already flavored so by adding the sugar called for in the recipe makes for a really sweet bean recipe.  To avoid all this, you need to use Grandma Browns Baked Beans for the beans called for in this recipe.  Grandma Browns Beans are VERY thick (you need a spoon to get them out of the can) and are generally not sweet on their own.  Then following the recipe exactly as stated, the beans turned out perfectly!  Oh \u2013 I did add a good squirt of yellow mustard, but that is the only change I made.  I thought a pound of bacon was going to be too much, but it really was not - the recipe is just perfect!",
