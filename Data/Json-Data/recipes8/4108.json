        "description": "Make this gluten-free bread in your bread maker. It's not as good as normal bread, but it's pretty good if you must avoid gluten. The mixture will look more like cake batter than bread dough in your machine, don't worry, it will be okay. The loaf may sink while it's baking, leaving a crusty, crunchy bowl on the exposed end, which you will want to slice off and discard. The finished bread will be quite firm and heavy, and I recommend slicing it thin. It makes good toast, but it toasts slowly. I use my darkest toaster setting and have to run that twice to get golden brown toast.",

I find that it is very forgiving about what kind of gluten free flour you buy so to save money I will buy any gluten free flour on sale. Also I have added  many add thing like raisins etc.. Although I put it together as recipes states and then add the nuts, raisins etc.. and I have had no problem..\n\nUpdate 3-10-20-2020 I have made this recipe  with 2 1/4 cups of Gluten free flour instead of 2 1/2 mixed it in a Kitchen aid... Let it mix for 10 min, and rest for 20 min.. mix again for 5 min and then  place on a cookie sheet with parchment paper It make excellent Biscuits/ Dumplings for Chicken and Biscuits or chicken and dumplings.. when making this recipe for bread or Biscuits 450 for 10 minutes.. If looking for a butter flavor to the bread or biscuit recipe add 1/3 stick of butter to the mix as last ingredient.",

If your bread machine does not have a gluten-free setting but does have a rapid rise setting this will work.  If your only option is the basic I suggest running your bread machine empty and watching it.  Find at what time it does the 3rd quick knead of the bread mine is around when it has about 1 hour and 45 min left for the whole process. About 5 minutes before it gets there (I just don't like cutting it too close), cancel the machines process and let it sit for a couple of mins and then press bake.  This is gluten-free bread which does not like to nor does it go well when made to rise repeatedly.  If you do it like this the bread will come out much much better.",
