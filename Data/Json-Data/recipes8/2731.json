These are fabulous served warm with homemade salsa and guacamole!",

I used two different corn tortillas... one had been in the fridge for a few days and the other I bought just today. I found that the older tortillas came out better... they were thinner and tasted more like store bought chips. The fresher ones turned out harder than the older ones although they were the same brand. I prefer the older ones. Just a side note!",

We didn't use the fresh made tortillas for our chips because the water content is too high.  I would definitely suggest using older tortillas, or letting the tortillas sit out between a couple of paper towels for half an hour before frying them.",
