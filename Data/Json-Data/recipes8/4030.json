I used coconut oil because that's what I use for all my cooking and baking. I love cinnamon so I used a tablespoon. I had some King Arthur Cake Enhancer for gluten free baked goods and added 2 Tbsp. but I'm sure it's good without it. I did not have pumpkin puree and am not fond of pumpkin so I substituted Orange-Apricot Marmalade which gave it a delicious hint of citrus and I added chopped walnuts and raisins. Since I wanted large muffins and had just purchased and received a hamburger bun pan from Amazon I used that. This made six large muffins so it would probably make a dozen regular muffins. My husband loved them and you would not be able to guess they are gluten-free if you didn't know. Thank you for this recipe.",
