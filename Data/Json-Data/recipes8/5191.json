To fill it out a bit I threw in some chopped celery. Good quick dinner (when combined with some seasoned steak fries dug out of the deep freeze) at the last minute.",

I did omit the hard boiled eggs and added an extra can of tuna. I didn't measure everything exactly just did it to taste also adding a little salt and pepper. The flavor was great. I really enjoyed this take on a traditional tuna sandwich/melt. I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

But this is a great recipe for customizing to your personal taste! I think you could make the tuna how you like it then make the coneys. In fact I think this is so great I am passing this to a friend who has a Boy Scout's troop. She is always looking for recipes and I think this would be a perfect camping recipe! Great for kids!
