I added onions to the pot as one reviewer had mentioned which I thought was an excellent suggestion! I served with rice and thought it was a tasty, well-rounded dish. It reminded me a lot of a sweet and sour dish you would get at a Chinese place but with meatballs. Bonus: now the kitchen smells amazing!",
