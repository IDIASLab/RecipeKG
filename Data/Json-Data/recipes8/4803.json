I scaled it down to 2.. still found I only needed 1/4 lb flank versus the 3/4 lb it scaled down to. I had no idea how many portobello mushrooms were required for 1 cup so I just used 2. I wish I had added 1 whole tomato (as instructed) instead of half - will do that next time. And there WILL BE a next time!! Yum!",

I added some balsamic vinegar when I added mushrooms which I think improves the flavor. I would definitely try to thicken the sauce next time though perhaps with some cornstarch. I used strip steaks I would double the amount of meat called for if you're feeding a family but the marinade was great and the meat was tender. The whole dish was very unique and certainly worth my while.",
