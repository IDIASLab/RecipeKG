It is a very versatile recipe in that you can substitute any chicken parts for the thighs, use whatever vegetables and herbs you have in the house, or any cheese you prefer.  I have used broccoli when I have no zucchini on hand, and added dill when I have some of that.  Any way you make it, it is an easy weeknight meal that has a sauce that is delicious over rice.",

The only thing I would do different is to brown the thighs first. The sauce was wonderful over rice and I could see adding a bit of wine to the sauce next time too!",

I used cream of mushroom soup. I didn't use all the pepper it called for and sprinkled the cheese (shredded mix of cheese)on top at the end of baking. Yum!",

I added 2 cans of soup (1 chicken, 1 corn) also added water, had no wine so didn't bother.  Next time i will add the 2 soups but no water, mushrooms and zucchini release a lot of liquid so i feel it is not needed. I will add some thyme in the future for a boost, it needed a little something extra. Good over rice.",
