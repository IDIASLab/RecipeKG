I didn't have four corn tortillas just two small ones which worked out anyway seeing as I'm watching my carb intake. Right before serving I sprinkled on a quarter cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. The corn tortillas used in this recipe were interesting the kids thought it was great. Four and a half stars really. It's no different than making breakfast wraps the \"wrap\" is just chopped up and tossed instead.",

I like the spiciness the salsa lends to the egg beaters. I use egg beaters all the time especially in baking to cut down on the cholesterol but they really don't have much flavor in regular cooking. You are better off jacking up the seasoning or using real eggs instead but the salsa in this takes care of that. For those of you who don't use egg subs 1/4 c egg sub=1 egg. I can't say I like the tortillas added to this and I just put the eggs and salsa together in the pan so both were cooked at the same time. Bf wasn't too impressed--not so sold on the idea of eggs and salsa. So something I could make again for myself but apparently not for the bf! I used a black bean and corn salsa for mine. thanks for the recipe.",
