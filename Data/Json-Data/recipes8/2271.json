I followed this as written and it is so very different I never had a salad similar to this even though I love feta. Letting this sit for 30 mins does wonders the flavors blend beautifully. I can't wait to make this throughout the summer with fresh locally grown melons. It's perfect to me as written and this would compliment so many grilled summer foods. I made sure I had watermelon feta and onion in every bite this is great. The mustard also adds a wonderful touch to the dressing. I will make this salad often and can't wait to try it out on others! Thanks Evin for sharing this one this is a keeper for sure:)",

I followed the directions to a T. I only used about half of the dressing total. I loved the salad and so did my 8 yo son. I loved the fact that it did not make a huge amount. Leftovers probably would not keep well. The jury is still out with my hubby but he ate a nice size portion so I think that is a good sign. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!",
