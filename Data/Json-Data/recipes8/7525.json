I made it exactly as is and my son and I just kept raving about it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a tad dry not dry but just a tad. I felt like it needed a little moisture. This recipe has great possibilities. As we were eating it we were exclaiming how delicious it would be with eggs in and turn it into a breakfast braid or make it up like a pizza braid. Endless possibilities! Thanks Fioa for sharing it! It's really good!! We'll be making this again!!",
