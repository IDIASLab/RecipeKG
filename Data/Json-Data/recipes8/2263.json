This is how I did it: doubled the recipe but used a little less than 4 pounds of watermelon, added a cup of pureed fresh strawberries and blueberries (because the melon I bought was pinkish white inside instead of dark red and not at all sweet), added only half of the amount of sugar and instead of champagne I used 7up. The granita took much more time to freeze than 2 hours. It tasted most of all of the berries, but the watermelony (or rather cucumbery) tones took over after a while. 5 days later, it is stone frozen (which I don't mind) and the sweet flavours are much more prominent. I think that if you used a really ripe and sweet watermelon, it would produce a similar taste... All in all, if I have a leftover watermelon again, I will make this granita again!",

This recipe made more than 4 servings but is an excellent way to use up extra watermelon. It took closer to 4 hours for it to freeze properly.",
