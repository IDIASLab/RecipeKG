I was distracted when I was making the recipe and ended up mixing the spices with the lime juice, so I basted the fish with it before cooking and it was still fantastic! I reduced the salt by half and only used a quarter of the black pepper, omitted the cheese and used lettuce and the salsa from the \"Fiery Fish Tacos with Crunchy Corn Salsa.\" Yogurt dressing was stunning with Sriracha sauce. This recipe makes A LOT!",

The recipe made so much, we took some to the neighbors and still have some for leftovers. There is definitely a kick, but it is flavorful without being overpowering. The cilantro and lime are delicious additions. We had flour tortillas, which were still good. There is no need for salsa. We will definitely make these again.
