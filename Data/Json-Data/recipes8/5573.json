Well, the only thing I didn't forget was this special potato gratin that Chef John Schenk taught me how to make 10 years ago at his restaurant Strip House. Not only is it the soul mate of steak, but it's also a great side dish for big holiday gatherings since you can make it the day before and bake when needed.",

Second round - by request BTW for New Year's day dinner - was a bit  shy of cheddar so shaved in half a stick frozen butter and green onion in place of shallot as it's what I had. Rave reviews again.  Personally prefer the green onion cuz I like 'em but this appears to be a user friendly recipe. Will stick with half the salt, green onion, probably try yellow cheddar for more visual interest since it's just lightly tossed in and maybe some bacon.  Great recipe.

I did not know that once the potatoes are cooked that you had to let them sit in the fridge for 8 hours or overnight. It makes perfect sense though. But I was in the mood for them today and did not want to wait that long. After I cooked the potatoes, I left them in the aluminum foil and put them in a big bowl of ice water with extra ice packs just to make sure the water stayed cold. It worked perfectly for me. I took the potatoes out of the water after an hour of sitting in there. I then shredded the potatoes as instructed. I did substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream. I also used half the sour cream like others had suggested. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe and I would definitely make this again!!",
