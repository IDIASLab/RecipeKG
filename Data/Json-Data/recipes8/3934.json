I marinaded the two loins and 8 small steaks overnight. Reduced the marinade and added two tablespoons of grape jelly to tone down the tang of the vinegar. I seared the loins in a black iron skillet with ghee and then wrapped  the loins in the bacon,took more like 15 minutes to get the bacon right at 350 in the oven. I then saut\u00e9ed 2 shallots,3 cloves of garlic 1 sweet onion and  3 cups of mushrooms in the bacon drippings. Placed the mushrooms in a baking dish with the bacon wrapped loins and baked for about 40 minutes. Seared the steaks in bacon fat. I removed the bacon ,diced it and crisped it up in the skillet while the loins rested. Plated the sliced loins atop the mushrooms along with the steaks. Drizzled sauce over meat and garnished with bacon and scallions. YUM!",

Place the empty skillet in 375 oven, next to a parchment lined pan of singly layered bacon(1 slice for each medallion), and bake for 15 minutes. During that time rinse the venison medallions in cold water, pat dry with paper towel. At 15 minutes open the oven, remove pan of bacon, leave skillet in oven. Allow bacon to cool.\n\nOn one side of each slice of bacon, lay a venison medallion, sprinkle with seasonings,and fold bacon over top. Carefully remove skillet from oven. Pour excess bacon drippings into skillet, arrange medallions in drippings, and return skillet to oven. Bake 375, 20 minutes medium rare. \nWhile medallions are baking, saute vegetables. I used 1/2 medium sweet onion (instead of green onion), 8 oz sliced baby portabella mushrooms, and 1 tbsp minced garlic in 4 tbsp butter. Keeping heat at medium while sauteing to prevent burning. Did not use cream. Towards the end I added 1/2 tsp marjoram, 1 tsp parsley, sprinkle of salt, grate of pepper.\n\nRemove skillet from oven and allow venison to set 8 minutes. I baked some medium golden potatoes as a side dish and served the sauteed vegetables over both meat and taters.\nI've also made this recipe using pork/beef loin. And added many vegetables to the saute' such as spinach, summer squash, broccoli, cauliflower, sweet peppers, etc. This recipe is simply stellar.",

                "reviewBody": "Huntmom is my new hero!  This recipe is fabulous!  This was my first time ever cooking a venison tenderloin and I was super nervous and anxious to get it right.  This came out super tender and downright moist.  After reading the other reviews, I used one tenderloin instead of two, but still used the same amount of bacon.  I cut the tenderloin in half and stacked it so that I was more closely following the recipe, but again, it was my first one, so I don't know if that was necessary.  Also, because of the comment about the \"runny\" sauce, I added about a half tablespoon of cornstarch to it (put the cornstarch in a small cup or ramekin, then stir in a teaspoon at a time of the heated cream sauce until it goes from paste to liquid and then add it back to the sauce).  It was a wonderful, thick sauce that was a perfect compliment to the tenderloin.  BTW, the crimini mushrooms were exactly the right choice.  The \"earthy\" flavor is perfect with the game taste of the venison...and the game flavor is toned down by the cream sauce. \nAs far as cooking time, because of the comments I started checking temp at twenty minutes.  It actually took the full hour for mine to cook completely.  Great, great recipe.",

It's delicious! The sauce takes it to a whole new level and it looks so very elegant on a plate! I sauteed some asparagus in butter and garlic to go with. I did overcook it a tiny bit (45 minutes was too much for the ones I had) but it was still quite edible and not dry like other venison I've had. I slathered on the olive oil and was generous with the seasoning; the same thing I do with beef. I plan to experiment with cooking times and temps to get the bacon to crisp up more while not overcooking the meat and also maybe doubling and tying up the skinny part so it cooks more evenly. I will definitely make this again (sending son out hunting now...)!!",
