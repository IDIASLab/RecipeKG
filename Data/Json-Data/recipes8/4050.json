I didn't use the powdered buttermilk and wonder if it wouldn't be better to soak the chicken in buttermilk beforehand. I would definitely double the celery salt paprika (I used smoked) and cayenne. I cut my chicken into strips and added some zucchini and bell pepper rings. Thank you for the recipe.",
