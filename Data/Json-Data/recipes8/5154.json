I would call this recipe very nearly perfect. I usually swirl my martini (in the shaker) until my fingers start to freeze which might be a little less than 30 seconds. If there is any left in the shaker I pour it into a spare glass so it doesn't get too watered-down with melting ice. Lately I've been using anchovy-stuffed olives which I find quite delightful.",

The oldest recipes were two parts vermouth to one part gin I prefer four parts gin to one of vermouth and I prefer Noilly Prat over Martini-Rossi or Boisierre. Any good gin will do. some say the name came because it was first served at an inn in Martinez California. Others think it was named for the fine and powerful British Army Rifle the Martini. The Martini rifle had a powerful \"kick\" and so does a good Martini cocktail. This recipe is 8 to 1 and a bit drier than I like but it is a good one. If you like this try a bit more vermouth at least once. Ask me about my cousin Elizabeth's choice of vermouth!",
