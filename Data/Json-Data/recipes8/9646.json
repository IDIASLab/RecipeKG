Everyone loved it!\nI had never had a paprikash before, so I didn't have anything to compare it to, but since it was Chef John's, I can be certain it was one of the best examples!\n\nI am currently on the keto diet, so I had to have it without the pasta/dumplings. I tried to do cauliflower rice, but I don't think it was the right match LOL...ended up just eating the chicken and sauce by itself. \nI regret having it this way. After trying the sauce, I realized this one would have totally been worth cheating on my diet for lol! I can't wait to do it right next time :D.\nThanks, Chef John!",

It fell off the bone and had a ton of flavor, and the sauce was also incredible. Overall, a very satisfying and interesting dish. This recipe has to be given the highest possible marks.\u201d My thoughts and notes: Made this with the cast iron. I only had 6 chicken thighs but did not otherwise scale the recipe, so there was plenty of sauce for the accompanying pasta that I made with the dish. The sauce had a medium spice with the Hungarian paprika and was nice and creamy, kind of like a curry. I did not skim any fat off of the top of the dish, which is obviously unhealthy, but I\u2019m cool with that. Finally, I didn\u2019t have chives on hand but would include them next time as a nice garnish. Otherwise, I don\u2019t think I would change anything.",
