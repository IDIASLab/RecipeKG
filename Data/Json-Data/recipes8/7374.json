A whole 8 oz. package of mushrooms to a mere  cup of green beans would be just a tad heavy on the mushrooms - unless this was a mushroom side dish and not a green bean side dish! That said, I chose to substitute fresh green beans, cooking them in simmering water for five minutes, then transferring them to an ice bath.  I used a combination of butter and bacon grease to saut\u00e9 my desired amount of mushrooms, onions and, at the last, the garlic, and cooked bacon - then tossed in the cooked green beans and heated them through. All of the additions - the garlic, onion, bacon, mushrooms and lemon-pepper seasoning all contributed great flavor to this unordinary green bean side dish.",

I used a whole bag.\" Yea, the main ingredient \"guts\" of this recipe have a ratio that's a wee bit off. I wanted 4 of us to get nice helpings of green beans alongside salmon, and one cup ain't gonna cut it, folks. Oh, and why use butter to saute the garlic, onion and mushrooms, and not the bacon grease from getting the 2 TB of crumbled bacon? (Unless --shudder-- you're using a jar of bac'o-bits?) - so I did just that, sauteed in the bacon grease, continued w/ rest of recipe, but used a 12 oz. bag of frozen green beans. The taste though - WOW. I'd give 10 stars alone for a magical mix of mushroom/bacon/bean!!",
