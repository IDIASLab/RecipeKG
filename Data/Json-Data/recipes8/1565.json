At first chunks of muffin stuck to it, so I thought it was just a matter of waiting for them to fully cool. Now that they have, the paper sticks to them and I have to carve the paper off with a knife. Sheesh, I did everything as written too. I wonder if it would work better to grease the paper itself or to just not use any paper, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be trying these again.",
