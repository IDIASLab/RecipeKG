My husband puts it in lettuce leaves. My daughters like it simply as a salad. I add pepperoncini to it on a sandwich.  I put alfalfa sprouts with it on one sandwich and that was also amazing.  This is one recipe I will never get tired of making, serving or eating!\n\nOther things we do:  if you want a bit of a bite it\u2019s tasty with a bit of horseradish added to the Mayo.  I want to try it with dried cranberries or craisins.  It was good with hemp hearts also.  Slivered almonds are good too.  Although I think the pecans as called for in the recipe are still my preference.  I love this stuff!!  Thanks again",
