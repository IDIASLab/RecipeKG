        "description": "This recipe was devised when I had a lot of limes on hand. I'm sure you could use any citrus fruit you like. The key is using healthy ingredients! This muffin is a moderately sweet breakfast treat but much healthier than sweet cereal. The coconut oil is very healthy for you, and so is the flaxseed. Never use margarine! Always use non-aluminum baking powder. I use white whole wheat flour, it comes from white wheat instead of red wheat. These are always a hit at my house.",

I've been on a mission to use up some of the coconut I have had in the cupboard for what seems like forever. It's still good but I wanted to make sure it stays that way so I thought these would be a good thing to try especially as I also have flaxseed meal to use up. These are a hearty somewhat limey muffin. This makes 24 regular muffins so bear that in mind if you are looking to make a small batch. You will only get a small batch if you make large muffins. With smaller muffins I baked for about 25 minutes which worked well. Thanks for the recipe!",

Rather than the whole wheat flour I used coconut flour so I doubled the milk since more liquid is needed when using coconut flour. I didn't add the flaxseed because I didn't have it. I did use the all purpose flour amount as called for. I sprinkled the tops with coconut so when they cooked the coconut toasted. I am not sure what size muffin tin the recipe writer used but I used standard cups and it made about 20 muffins and I only needed to bake them for 20 minutes.",
