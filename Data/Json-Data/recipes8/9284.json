But then one day, I was served a marmalade that changed my life--or at least what I thought about marmalade. I've been a huge fan of that style ever since, and it's exactly the kind I'm showing you in this recipe!",

That is one  good marmalade. I mentioned that I like them tart so this may be the best one I have ever tasted.\"\nNow two more friends are wanting some, so I am making another batch. \nI also recently gave some to new neighbors, along with some Blood Orange Orangecello I made, some tea from a local tea shop, and some Grasmere-style Gingerbread. \n\nI wasn't a big marmalade fan either, before this, but I love this on an English Muffin! And it's easy to make, except maybe doing the fine julienne of the peel, which can get a bit tedious. \n\nThis marmalade isn't cloyingly sweet like some, and it isn't overly dense with peel, like some.\n\nI would like to know an actually measure of how much peel goes into it, because the oranges off my tree can vary in size a lot.",
