We used Frank's RedHot Sauce in place of the Chipotle since we had it on hand, but my guess is that it was just as good.  Some complained of the heat, but our beans were even gobbled up by our 18 month and four year old.  We even tried to make a second batch on the rangetop after they were gone.  We didn't have all of the fixin's so those weren't as good. Anyway, give these a try - you'll go back for more until the pot is empty, I promise!",

I might be new, but I know that certain pots and pans can give the food a different taste and I thought maybe the Dutch oven did that.  In anycase I just used a regular pan and I 1/2'd the recipe.  It was still plentiful even though it went kind of quick.  Very very delicious and easy to make.  I made it in my wok.  Thanks Danopak.",

I also make my own brown sugar using white sugar and molasses (so easy and cheaper than buying brown sugar!) I added about 2 Tbsp. of chili powder and a Tbsp. of Cumin. I cut the recipe in half also since I'm not feeding an army. Cooked this in my electric skillet instead of baking it. I also had to add about a cup and a half of water as it was cooking because it was very thick and we like our beans a little looser. Great recipe! Sorry I didn't follow it exactly but it still came out yummy.",
