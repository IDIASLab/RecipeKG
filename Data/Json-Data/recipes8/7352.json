Well, this holiday weekend, she was not feeling well so I decided to try this one and I am so glad I did.  I stuck to the recipe and it is AMAZING.  My 8 year old son and I cook together and whipped this out in no time and even my wife has rated it better than hers.  I took some to our Memorial Day pool party and it was a hit with everyone one there too.",

I just sampled the finished product and the two cloves of chopped fresh garlic that I used are a big flavor enhancer. I'm sure this will be better after it stands but I couldn't wait!
