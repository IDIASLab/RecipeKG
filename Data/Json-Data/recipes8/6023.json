With the a cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar and the tomato juice, that was a lot of liquid to thicken with a teaspoon of cornstarch.  I cooked the sauce down for a while and ended up adding even more cornstarch to slightly thicken.  A little balsamic heavy for my taste, but that could be personal taste preference.  We\u2019ve had a lot of bad rain torms over the past week, so I grilled the chicken earlier in the day when the weather broke for a while, and then sliced down and reheated in the sauce later in the day.  Served with succotash, baked acorn squash, and some white rice for a nice Saturday evening dinner.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
