The flavors just keep combining which makes this recipe wonderful as a make ahead option. We really loved the addition of bacon in the salad too. Placing the cauliflower in the freezer is ingenious as well especially if you need to serve it with your meal day of/right away. If you like dill in potato salads just add a little dried dill or your favorite dill blend. As written you won't be disappointed though as it definitely hits the spot and is so delicious. Heck this recipe is our new favorite for a mock potato salad! Thank you for sharing the recipe!",

So it was a nice change to make while reducing carbs. Next time I try this, I would add extra ingredients like more bacon, cheese, seasonings, etc. to try to cover up the prominent cauliflower taste in it, for us to like it better. Thank you for the recipe idea!",
