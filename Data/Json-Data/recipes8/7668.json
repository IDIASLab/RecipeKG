If you'd rather call these crab wontons or crab dumplings (or even cheater tortellini!), go ahead. No matter what you call them, this is definitely something you want in your bag of culinary tricks. They're loaded with crab and the tortellini shape does a great job of catching and holding on to all the delicious sauce.",
