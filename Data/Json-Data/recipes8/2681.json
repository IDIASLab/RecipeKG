I made a very small batch, and cooked it in an 8 x 8 pan, all crammed together, next time I think that I will use a cookie sheet, that has not been greased, since the tortillas have been dipped in oil you really don't need it.  Doing this I am hoping that I will get them crispy all around, perhaps I will even turn them and bake them for a couple of extra minutes.  Anyway the taste was great, and I will make again!!!  I boiled my chicken breasts on the stove until just done and then shredded with forks, seemed to work just fine.  Thanks for this great recipe!!!",

Second, you will need a lot more oil than what is suggested for.  I ended up using about a tablespoon for every 2 tortillas.  When using the corn tortillas, you need them as pliable as possible which requires the oil.",

I used all of it so I upped the salsa to a 16 oz. jar (Santa Barbara brand roasted pepper chile). I didn't measure the cheese (monterey-jack) or meat mixture - I eyeballed it (just be sure you don't fill your tortillas too full....). I also skipped the frying in oil step. All I did was lightly spray ea. tortilla w/ Pam and heat both sides (5 sec. MAX) in a hot skillet. I then blotted my tortillas to soak up any excess grease (too much oil = sogginess) and proceeded to fill ea. one. I placed all 12 flautas (that's how many tortillas were in the pkg. I purchased) on a cookie sheet & lightly sprayed w/ cooking spray one last time b4 placing in the oven to crisp up. It took dbl. the amt. of time called for to crisp to my liking but the wait was well worth it! Oh and I placed my oven rack near the top for the final 20 min. of baking & I think this helped a LOT. Since I have so much meat mixture left I'm going to freeze it for another batch. Served over a shredded lettuce / chopped tomato salad w/ Mexican rice refried beans & Mike's hard margaritas on the side. To replicate Chevy's flautas (which I LOVE!) I poured melted queso & pineapple chipotle salsa over mine and a bit of jalapeno jelly on the side. My husband spooned salsa over his. Thanks for sharing Arlene. I'm not even going to try HeidiS's chicken taquitos because your flautas were THAT good!:-)",
