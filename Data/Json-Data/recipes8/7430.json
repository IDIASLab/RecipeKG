If you are not dieting or concerned with calories, give this a try.  It is also good rewarmed and wrapped in a flour tortilla with a little salsa for a great breakfast treat.",

A little cheesy (might try half the amount of shredded cheese next time) - maybe it's because I used cheddar jack instead of just monterey jack? A lot on the watery/mushy side - I'd think about putting down a brioche crust and adding some milk to compensate to make it more strata-like next time. Love the amount it makes though.  Hubby loved it so I can't really complain. Used 6 slices of bacon baked at 365 for 14 minutes then cut up with scissors.",

I have been looking for a breakfast casserole that I liked for a long time and I have  finally found it.  She did use half cottage cheese and half mascarpone because that's what she had on hand and she also drained the cottage cheese as another reviewer suggested. I loved the  texture and I think not using bread or potatoes is the key  besides toast can always be  served  on the  side.
