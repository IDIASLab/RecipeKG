                "reviewBody": "6.26.19 Do plan on having vegetable broth on hand because you will need it. The recipe doesn t say to cover the skillet but I did just to get the carrots cooked. I followed the recipe except for using probably closer to a cup of broth rather than a half-cup and adding it to the chickpea mixture along with the spices. I could see no other way the carrots were going to cook in a dry mixture felt this needed moisture for tender carrots. If I were to make this again I d probably pop the carrots in the microwave for about a minute to give them a head start on cooking. The flavor of the curry changed dramatically from the beginning to the end so don t shortcut the 30 minute cook time. Honestly I haven t had that much Indian cuisine but I did like the blend of spices in this curry. It was O.K. just not sure I ll make again. I think that comment is more a matter of personal taste rather than any fault of the recipe. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
