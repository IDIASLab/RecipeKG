I like this drink sitting in the backyard while grilling anything! I think it also makes a good winter drink when you need a quick 'get-away,' as long as you can find the watermelon!",

This would be so watered down that it's barely alcoholic. I highly suggest you make it using standard drink proportions - 1.5oz of gin to 3oz of tonic water...or 2oz gin to 4oz tonic.  I liked the fresh flavor from the watermelon, but it was very subtle. Next time I'll muddle some watermelon in a shaker with the gin, add ice, then strain it into a glass with more watermelon cubes. I'll be making this again as a regular summer drink.",
