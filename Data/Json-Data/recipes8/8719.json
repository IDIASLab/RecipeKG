I think next time I'd try 3/4 teaspoon and go from there. I'd also suggest using 2 tablespoons of balsamic instead of 1/4 cup. There's no salt in this dish, and I found adding a sprinkle to the finished dish was needed. The thighs were perfectly cooked after 10 minutes. A simple meal for a busy weeknight.",
