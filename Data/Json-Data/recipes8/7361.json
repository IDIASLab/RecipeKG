I followed the recipe except I used crunchy peanut butter and instead of cooking bacon I used real bacon bits. It was delicious!!!! Great bacon flavor, not too much or too little, same for peanut butter. I also rolled the balls if dough in more sugar than just a spoonful. It was a bit like a sugar cookie on the outside. Made this about 3 times. My family was also a bit iffy. Needless to say, cookies were gone in minutes lol",

The only thing I did differently was that I used regular bacon instead of maple, and I'd add that it should be fairly well done and then patted dry of grease. That's how I treat my bacon for most recipes, but I found that it still softened up a little in the dough while baking though it had been crisp enough to crumble (rather than chop) going in. \n\nWith all that said, I found that this recipe was a great balance of sweet and savory, even smoky depending on the type of bacon used. The texture is melt in your mouth, and I'm dying to see how they go over at Sunday football and Monday meetings.",

I doubt that makes a difference. I really didn't expect them to come together but they did. They look like regular cookies. My first impression is that they taste like sweet bacon flavored peanut butter. I'll see what others think. Right now I doubt I'd make them again. Quick and easy though! Update I have now made these a second time. I had some bacon leftover from breakfast and since these are so quick and easy and I was in a cookie baking mood I decided to give them a second try. I still think it is a weird combination but DH seems to really like them as do his coworkers.",

The cookies themselves were so greasy that they formed one massive cookie when baked and the flavor of grease left on the palette after eating was not appetizing. It was more of a grease node than actual bacon for me. But perhaps this could be remedied with turkey bacon instead although I will probably not make these again.",

To deal with the grease and get delicious crispy on the outside soft on the inside cookies fry up your bacon bits in a cast iron or other pan once crunchy and dark scoop them onto a plate with a paper towel on top to soak the majority of the grease up. I waited about 7 minutes or so to use the bits. Once folding them into the batter I got another few paper towels and squeezed more of the grease into it and used the remaining grease in the batter and rolled the cookies and rolled the cookies in the sugar. I cooked mine an extra 2 minutes in the oven after turning the oven off. The result was delicious. My cookies turned out the way I love",
