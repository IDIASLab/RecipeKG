Serve it with a large bowl of mashed potatoes.  Of course a Greek salad, some feta & olives and crusty bread give this meal the final touches.  The onions can be time consuming to clean, but well worth it when your family sits down to eat.",

To cut the acidity of the tomato paste and wine I added about 2 tsp of sugar. Will definately be making this more often. Note: If you don't have whole pickling spice use: 1ts whole cloves more bayleaves (2) whole peper corns. It's not the same but will add a bit more flavour.",

This recipe gives you a beefywatery base - no red tomato color. i am questioning the picture as it looks like there are tomatos in it. My family thought this tastes pretty good but question the color. Maybe I can add some tomato sauce to see if this will improve the flavor/appearance. I used my crockpot on low for 12 hours. Easy recipe to follow. Would I make it again? It's missing something. It might be the addition of tomato sauce.",
