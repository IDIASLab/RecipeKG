I used unbleached bread flour and wild dried blueberries. not sure if that made a difference or not. I considered cutting back the sugar but went with the recipe and it's perfect as written. Thanks for sharing we throughly enjoyed this! Update: I forgot to mention that there was no oven temp stated when I made this. The original recipe states 375 so that's what I went with.",
