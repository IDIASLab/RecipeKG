Some folks may not know what \"mixed spice\" is- not to be confused with pumpkin pie spice. My tried and true Lebanese mixed spice is as follows: In small bowl stir together 1/4 tsp. powdered allspice, 1 tsp. black pepper, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. ground  cloves, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. fenugreek and 2 tsp. powdered ginger. You can adjust the proportions to your preference. The spices must then be ground together in either a clean coffee mill or a pestle and mortar. All of these spices are readily available in health food/ethnic food stores or any grocer that sells herbs and spices in bulk. Thank you for sharing your version of a truly delicious dish.",

I'm not particularly a big fan of hummus so the sauce in this meal really turned me off and infact made me gag. Besides the sauce the chicken came out great except for there was too much of something in the spices that over powered the entire flavor. If you want something interesting try this. If you want shawarma then don't. Oh yeah because we were over powered by some spice in this recipe we had to drown it in BBQ sauce(blasphamy I know.)",

I grilled the chicken (I used boneless breasts) and brushed the flatbread lightly with olive oil and grilled them just until warm when the chicken was done.
