I used about half of the recommended amount of lentils so that it didn't get too thick and it came out wonderfully. The tomato paste gave it a wonderfully rich flavor so if you prefer your soups \"brothier \" go with less tomato paste. We skipped the sherry and just went with a sprinkling of parmesan and it was perfect. This probably would work well with cannellini if you don't have lentils on hand. Thanks for an excellent recipe!",

I only had 4 cups of broth so mine turned out a little more like stew than soup but is quite tasty anyway. I wouldn't suggest serving this to anyone who doesn't like lentils as the flavor definitely comes through but the onion and pepper flavors are less pronounced. I might top some of the leftovers with sour cream and a little salt instead of parmesan. Next time I make this I will probably add more mushrooms.",
