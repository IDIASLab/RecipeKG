I placed the dough in the freezer for 4 hours (checking every hour) and it was still almost impossible to handle the dough without it sticking to my hands or the cookie scoop. After srtuggling for quite sometime, I was able to make 12 balls. I sprayed a fork to be able to do the criss-cross pattern, and struggled with that also. I wound up baking the rest of the dough as a loaf. This should be bread not cookies and there is no similarity to PB Cookies. Unfortunately, I will not make these again.",
