The sausage keeps everything moist and enhances the flavor of all of the other ingredients.\nI have used cornbread from a mix as well as homemade, used dry bread, bagged stuffing cubes, etc. and it always turns out great.\nThe one thing I don't substitute out is Jimmie Dean Sausage.  I do, however, change out the different types to suit my current mood.  Most times I use the regular pork sausage but it is also very tasty using Italian or sage.  \nI made this as written, minus the mushrooms this time because I didn't have any on hand and we're not going out to stores much these days due to the pandemic.  If I happen to forget something at the grocery store, I just make do.  Boy how times have changed! :-)\nOne thing I love about this recipe is how versitile it is.   I like to use dried cranberries and walnuts or pecans sometimes and it works beautifully with the other ingredients.  I will sometimes add chopped waterchestnuts, carrots, apples, you name it and it always comes out delicious.\nI don't just make this stuffing for holidays or special occasions; I make it throughout the year.\nIts easy to make and goes well with turkey, chicken, pork roasts and pork chops.  It's a great side to weeknight meals and reheats well , that is if there's any left!",

This year I decided to try something new, which has completely different ingredients from my usual. So good and very flavorful! The sausage and cornbread go so well together. For the cornbread, I whipped up a box of Jiffy cornbread the day before.  I also chopped the veggies the night before so they were ready to go on Thanksgiving.
