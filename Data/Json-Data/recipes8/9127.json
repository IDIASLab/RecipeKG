Follow the directions exactly and it'll be a hit. I cooked mine for a rare/medium rare to his time specification and it was perfect.  The mushroom and pate mixture was incredible! \nI wonder if laying a layer of pastry on the top and one on the bottom,  then trimming and binding them on the sides would work so that you're not having to stretch the pastry at all would work? I have no idea. Either way, mine turned out perfectly. And I enjoyed having the extra puff pastry on the bottom.",

We made 2 individual 6 oz fillets and because of the richness from the puff and pate, we decided that next time we make these we probably only need to make 1! I am also not sure the extra puff disc is needed as there is already a ton of pastry- more than if you had made the whole tenderloin. We served with carrots and potatoes like Chef John which were absolutely delicious as well!",
