        "description": "A solid turkey pot pie recipe. It's a great way to use up leftover veggies or meat in your fridge at the end of the week or from big holiday meals. Don't have one of the vegetables listed? Just swap the equivalent of another veggie you do have in there! Have leftover cooked rice? Throw it in with the peas! Have chicken, ham, ground beef, pork roast, beef steak, etc. rather than turkey? Great, use what you have! One of our favorites is rotisserie chicken shredded up and stock that I make from those bones. Do what works for you. They freeze well and are a legit way to send a frozen care package meal to someone.",
