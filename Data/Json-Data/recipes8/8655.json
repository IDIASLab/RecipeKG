I don't know about you but my pie plate is not nearly enough to hold 2 1/2 cups of broth let alone the other ingredients. Did two layers and that was about all it could hold. Like the other reviewers it was a little too spicy (but I'm guessing hat really depends on the peppers which can be unpredictable) and that the 1/2 cup of chicken grease at the end is not really necessary. Shredding the chicken should be in the recipe someplace. Might make this again with a few tweaks.",
