        "description": "Treating lamb to this root beer marinade has historically been a success, so I've been eager to try it with some skewered beef. I originally used 2 tablespoons honey, which was too sweet, so I've adjusted it in the ingredients list and added vinegar as well. This recipe is easy to adapt, and I'm not just talking about the pre-grill soak, but also the glaze we make with the extra marinade. The flavor is reminiscent of bourbon beef.",

Cooked on gas grill over direct heat, about 450 degrees.   I cooked about 4 minutes per side and it was perfectly done.\n\nI love the glaze, it was worth the extra effort to boil down the marinade to make it thick.   \n\nI would like to try this on lamb.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE: 7/12/18\n\nMade this again and this time I cut all the spices in 1/2 because my wife can not handle spicy foods very well.  I also increased the honey a little.  I felt the flavor did not suffer and this time I could taste the root beer.  \n\nI like my food spicy so I added chipotle on my after cooking.  I think it taste about the same as when added to the marinade.   I made the glaze again and I do think it is worth extra time/effort.",
