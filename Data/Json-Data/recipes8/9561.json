        "description": "A quick and tasty dinner for two can be ready in minutes! Fresh or thawed frozen salmon filets are air-fried, then coated with a sweet-spicy glaze. Add some sesame seeds, sliced scallions, and a light squeeze of lemon juice for extra flavor, if you like. We like these with a steamed green vegetable and rice, or roasted potatoes and a salad.  With either menu, it's great for a quick and elegant meal on a weeknight, or for an easy start to the weekend. Want to serve four people? Simply double the recipe, and adjust the cook time by a couple of minutes.",
