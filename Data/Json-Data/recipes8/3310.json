But the next time, I just cooked the chicken thighs on the stove top for about 10-12 minutes with salt and pepper for seasoning and then finished baking them in the oven using thyme, tarragon, oregano, rosemary, and a garlic herb blend that I get at Kroger until done. I combined the salsa roja with the green salsa verde, used Taco Bell shredded cheese blend and Kraft Mexican cheese alternately, used less chicken than what the recipe called for, added the other ingredients in the recipe, and everything turned out great! \nI will definitely try to make this at least once a month. Hopefully one day I will make it with the grilled chicken next time.",
