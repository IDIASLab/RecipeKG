To try it this way double the amount of oats used(I halved the recipe so I ground 2 cups) and just set your blender or food processor on a high speed and grind for about 1 minute and voila! I also threw in a handful of sliced strawberries. Great recipe! Thanks HJWilson!",

I wanted a finer texture in our pancakes so I threw everything in the blender to turn the oats into a flour texture.  I also only added 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, and I halfed the oil and used canola oil instead of coconut.  (that much fat and I'm going to eat it in chocolate!)  I also added a little more skim milk.  When you put it on the griddle I took a spoon and spread it thiner otherwise they are so dense they will just be doughy.  Used frozed blueerry, thawed them and added them to the mix.  I also crushed them into the dough.  If you leave them as whole berries the rest of the dough has a hard time cooking because it's lumpy from the berries.  On the whole it was good.  Very filling.  I would eat them just as a breakfast cookie.  I'm going to try freezing them in baggies.",

We ate these tonight with free-range scrambled eggs and more than once I had to tell my kiddos to close their mouths -- their \"Mmmm\"s and \"Oh Yum\"s while chewing was a bit gross. :)  We didn't have any berries, so I finely diced up a slightly bruised and softening organic pear.  Also, I melted the coconut oil, but it reconstituted as I added in the other wet ingredients.  I just made sure to blend it well before I added the wet to dry, and the little chunks of coconut oil melted away as the pancake cooked.  Next time I make these, the melted coconut oil will be the last thing I add.  We loved these SO MUCH -- we'll absolutely be making them again at mealtime and for snacks.",
