I have made this many times since and it is one of the first appetizers to go!  It is simple enough for football parties or nice enough for cocktail parties.  Be careful when you slice the salami so that all the slices are on the same side.  The salami has a tendency to twist! Serve with crackers.",

At first I liked it but thought it was a little heavy on the bbq sauce and brown sugar so I made a mental note that I would reduce those ingredients next time. It wasn't until I was cleaning up that I realized it was only an 8 oz. roll of salami. So with that being said this recipe would be perfect as written. The key is to use a bbq sauce you are familiar with like and one that is not overly sweet. My go to bbq sauce is Gates which is a Kansas City style.",
