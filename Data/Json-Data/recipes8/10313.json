Best of all, it's ready in about 20 minutes. Be sure to use a tenderloin and not a loin - they are not the same size-wise and require very different cook times. I love to serve this with roasted Brussels sprouts and mashed sweet potatoes. Do not use thick-cut bacon, as it will not cook thoroughly.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a fun recipe! I used about twice as much rub as recommended and it came out nicely spiced. I didn't have regular cut bacon, so I nuked my thick cut bacon for 30 seconds before I wrapped the tenderloin. Ditto on the fig preserve, I didn't have any but I had lingonberries so I used them and they worked well. The thicker cut bacon still slowed the cooking process for the tenderloin so mine came out a bit closer to rare than medium rare. But I like it that way so that was a win. I served it with traditional stuffing and Italian green beans and it was a hit! I had extra bacon left over so I stacked 3\" strips beside the tenderloin in the cooking juices that came off the bacon and lingonberries and the extra bacon came out crispy on top and super juicy on the inside of the stack. It was like bacon candy! The cook got most of that, though!\n The dish looked really good, plus it was quick and delicious!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was Wonderful! Everyone loved it. The spice rub makes it quite flavorful and the balsamic glaze merely adds to it.\n\nI made it with no real changes. It calls for a balsamic glaze, the recipe for which is not included here but I found an Easy Balsamic Glaze in this site. The only minor change was my pork loin was about 3 1/2 pounds (it was 1/3 of a Costco pork loin which are huge) so my cook time was much longer. When I make it again, I'll split my pork loin lengthwise so it isn't so thick. I really liked this recipe and look forward to making it again. \n\nOne suggestion: When laying out the bacon, arrange the slices on waxed paper. Then lay the loin on the bacon and lift the edges of the waxed paper and turn it over. You can then easily peal off the waxed paper, leaving the bacon in place.",
