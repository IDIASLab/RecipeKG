I've yet to try one, as they're straight out of the oven, but if they didn't rise and were heavy going in, I'm pretty sure they're going to be heavy coming out. (Baking powder and baking soda fresh within the past month.)\n\nThis recipe does not make the big, over-sized muffins you'd expect. Probably wouldn't make them again.",
