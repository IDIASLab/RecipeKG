The video, in addition to showing the authenticity of this recipe, was also helpful as part of step 4 is missing: adding the cooked tomatoes and tomatillos to the blender and blending with the chile mixture. I followed the recipe exactly with two exceptions that I also recommend: 4 cups chicken broth was way too much for simmering the chicken in step 1. I used 2 cups and it was still too much. Next time I will use just enough to cover the chicken. Next, instead of adding 2 cups broth to the mole in step 6, I added a little at a time until the mole was the right consistency, tasting as I went. It ended up being only 1 cup. Finally, as a note: this recipe will make about a quart of mole -- roughly twice as much as you will need. Personally, I will be making more chicken rather than waste the mole!",

The recipe as written makes a lot of extra mole sauce, so I froze the leftovers. Probably could have done with only half the amount. And as another reviewer noted, I cut back on the chicken broth in the mole sauce (used about 1/2 the amount). We will make this again, on another day when we have a lot of time. Would recommend chopping everything up beforehand, rather than as you go like I did! It would probably save a lot of time in prep.",

The recipe doesn't specify whether you should use unsweetened chocolate but that's what I had. So I added several heapened teaspoons of sugar but ONE AT A TIME. The sauce moved from chocolate bitter bite to deep smooth mole not sweet. It never fails to amaze me how both salt and sugar balance acidity without adding a salty or sweet flavor. It just came together beautifully. Also I've worked with jalape\u00f1os plenty and I know to wear gloves. But I wasn't that familiar with these chilis and just... didn't. Don't do that. Hit Target for a box of basic latex gloves and suit up. My fingertips implore you!:-)",

I usual use half the chicken and sauce for one meal and freeze half for another meal.  When I have time, I buy fresh corn tortillas to make the enchiladas  which while not a necessity, definitely cranks up the quality points",
