I love almost everything I try of his.\n\nWell, he didn't disappoint. They aren't Lady Lee, but they are as close as I've been so far. We loved them. They were crisp on the outside, chewy on the edges, and gooey on the inside. We loved them. \n\nThanks, Chef John.",

There\u2019s also not a lot of chocolate flavor, which is really disappointing. The after taste is the worst part \u2014 It makes me feel like I just downed a tablespoon of pure sugar. He suggests a glass of milk, which I think would help a lot, but I also think they should be edible on their own! I\u2019ve tried to give them to 2 different people and they both say they\u2019re just too sweet. I\u2019d be curious to see how these come out with half the sugar and way more chocolate, so maybe give that a go if you try this recipe out.\n\nI love Chef John\u2019s videos, though!
