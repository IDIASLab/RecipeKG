I wanted a smooth dressing (no onion bits), so I put all ingredients except the oil into the blender, pulsed, and then streamed in the oil at the end with the blender running.  The end result was a dressing with perfect consistency.  You do need to let the flavors meld on this, so be sure to allow for some time in the fridge.  When I tasted this out of the blender, the olive oil was dominating, but after a couple hours in the fridge, it all came together.  This is a \"tangy\" french dressing with a lot of flavor and takes just minutes to make.  Thumbs up on this one.",

The color is more pale than Ruby Red as shown in the photo. Used regular mustard and a dash of worchestershire sauce to give it some zing. Better than any homemade French dressing recipe I've tried. My local cafe makes their own however this is superior to theirs. Love the consistency of the dressing which adheres to the lettuce beautifully.",
