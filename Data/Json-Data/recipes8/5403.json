Didn't add any salt per another reviewer, it's easy to add later if wanted. If you're using parmesan it adds a salty taste. This could be made vegan with Not So Chicken broth cubes and homemade cashew parmesan.  Asparagus or pea pods would be a nice addition later in cooking. Edit: After making this a few times I decided to cook the peppers and onions less. The peppers in particular benefit from still having crunch. Read that some like to use coconut oil because it will give a \"velvety\" texture that you generally will only get from saturated fat (meat).  It definitely seems to add something.  Worth trying if you've been substituting another oil like I was.",
