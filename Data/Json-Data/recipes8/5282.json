I plan to try it again using different flours perhaps a combination of brown and white rice flour and some teff. We find buckwheat to have a strong flavor. It made a very heavy loaf and for our taste needed spices perhaps cinnamon clove and cardamon. I appreciate the gluten free recipe and lack of added oil.",
