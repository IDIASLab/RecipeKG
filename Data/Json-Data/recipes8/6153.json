I didn't think 15 minutes of marinating time would be enough but it was very good!! We love spiced up food so next time I might marinate it even longer. We used our George Foreman grill and since it cooks both sides at the same time we just grilled it for 5 minutes and it came out great!!! Thanks Estherlita...this is wonderful!",

I'm used to a thicker sauce, and this turned out just how I wanted it.  A restaurant-quality recipe - thank you.",

I did not make the peanut sauce. I look forward to trying this again with a fattier cut of chicken like the thigh as well as with pork beef and prawns. This is a wonderful recipe.
