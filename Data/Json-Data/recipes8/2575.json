I opted to use whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose, just because I like the flavor of whole wheat, but kept everything else the same. It's so good! I really really like the cardamom paired with the blueberries. Just yum! And it's really not a difficult bread to make--it just takes some time. Definitely worth it! Thank you for sharing your recipe, Laura!",

I don't have a stand mixer and had to knead by hand, the dough was soft and not sticky; beautiful to work with. It did take me 15 minutes of hand kneading to get the \u201cwindow pane\u201d gluten development. And I had to look up how to shape the braid in a video since this was my first time making any babka.
