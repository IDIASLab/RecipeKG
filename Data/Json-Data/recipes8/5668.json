The rest of the ingredients cost $24 to play this game.  It was a lot of effort to put this together and wrap it.  I pressed it for 20 hours.  The results: meh.  A messy sandwich that falls apart too easy.  It tastes exactly as I imagined which is heavily fishy, salty, sour,  a little spice from the banana peppers, and a bite from the red onions. The egg adds almost nothing and if you are tasting egg it seem like a cameo of a non-relevant C-list actor in a blockbuster movie because the director knew he needed the money for back taxes.   Honestly, I want my $24 back.   However, I might try to salvage this by simply chopping everything and making an actual tuna salad out of it minus a lot of the olive oil.   At least the left over capers can go in mashed potatoes.",
