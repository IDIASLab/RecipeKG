        "description": "The smell of this spicy fennel bread is still lingering in the house making me feel so cozy! A few years ago, a breakfast spot opened up downtown that started making spicy fennel bagels. As an avid everything bagel lover, I was not sure at first but was quickly convinced to give it a try. Oh my goodness, was I happily surprised. The spice given off by the fennel was perfection melted into the bagel. A bit later I moved and craved these bagels so I decided to make my own version, spicy fennel bread.",

To test, I made it a second time and added twice the seasoning (including the red pepper). That did it for me. BUT I doubt everyone will want to do that. Understandable. I'm a fan of non-subtle.  I also waited 2 hours on the second rise before putting it in the oven because it didn't get as high throughout - I used my cast iron pot with lid. And both times I only did 15 minutes after removing the lid. I was going to do 4 stars but I'm going to change it.  This is a great recipe to be honest.  Just adjust.",
