I briefly thought about not using as much milk as stated but put it all in anyhow. It was a bit thin so next time I'll decrease it a little bit. All in all I'm very much liking this and will be using it again maybe adding some dried fruit in too.! Thanks a lot Wbolesnyc for this post!",

I first thought it was supposed to be just like the cream of wheat that i grew up eating.  Made this while our dinner of fresh homemade stuffing, sweet corncake, herbed chicken breast and yam and kale salad was in the oven.          When dinner was ready, my boyfriend chose to eat this instead!!!!    He's from Morocco and said that traditionally they would put olive oil on top. I can see how this recipe would be good for those who cannot chew their food, have upset stomachs or need to get nutrition on a budget; good breakfast or snack. Great, simple recipe.",
