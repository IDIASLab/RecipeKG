So after trying this recipe at a bridal shower I called her up and told her that this is what I was bringing to Christmas. She reluctantly agreed. When we arrived for Christmas dinner I saw that my mother-in-law had made a cheeseball her self and had it sitting out on the table. UUUGGGHHH! I refused to give up so I sat my cheeseball right down next to her's. By the end of the night everyone was raving about MY cheeseball and had scraped the plate clean. Her cheeseball however only had a couple of bites taken out of it. She ended up wrapping her's up and putting it back in the fridge!! HA HA!! Victory is mine!!! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe and the small gratification I got from making it. I added a little garlic powder and onion powder and I usually use about 4 green onions. This is the best cheeseball ever!!!",

Very finely chopped scallions and fresh chives.  I also added in about 1/2 cup of shredded mild cheddar cheese and I put my pecans in my food processor to make them smaller.  When I rolled my perfectly round cheese ball in the crushed pecans it really looked fabulous. I topped the ball with remaining scallions.  Oh good tip for any of you that have G. Foreman Grills - cooks your bacon in half the time and drains off alot of the fat & grease.  To crumble your bacon nicely, break it up and put it in a zip lock bag and crush up with a rolling pin.",

I also added garlic powder & onion powder....I thought it was pretty bland before the additions. I wasn't wow'ed by the recipe on teh night I served it (made it the same day) but when we had some the next night it was excellent. So definitely give the flavors some time to get to know one another.;o) Oh I also used real bacon bits instead of frying bacon...it's easier & leaner.
