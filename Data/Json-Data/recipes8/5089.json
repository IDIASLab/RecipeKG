I'm not sure how big the sweet potatoes are supposed to be but I've taken to only using TWO fairly large ones -- otherwise the \"soup\" is basically \"flavored mashed potatoes\". I recommend doubling the Italian seasoning and I always go hog wild on the garlic-- I buy the stuff in the jar and huge add a big spoon of it. I don't think that the original recipe mentions it but using the half-and-half to help when you are pureeing the sweet potatoes is a good trick-- you'll get much smoother results.",

Since I was missing some things i used 2% milk instead of the half and half added 2 med/small white potatoes (since i didnt have enough sweet potatoes left from xmas dinner) and made my own itialian seasoning mix ( basil organo garlic power red pepper & salt.. which i made to taste). So with making the changes that i did my husband LOVED IT as well the smell coming from the kitchen. When I tasted the dish it was like an explosion of taste. The sweetness then the zest from the sausage and the spices. My husband mentioned that I can make this anytime which is good since it was easy and tasted great!!!!",

But I had 2 large sweet potatoes I needed to use and 1 pound of frozen italian sausage. I used 3 cups of chicken broth (brought it to a boil) and placed in a crockpot. Added the sweet potatoes onions garlic 1 tsp of italian seasonings and placed the frozen sausage on top and allowed it to cook on high for 3 hours. At 3 hours everything was cooked. I took out the sausage to break it up in a bowl and used an immersion blender only adding about 1/2 cup almond milk. Added a can of mushrooms (drained) the sausage and about 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes back into the pot. This was delicious. My husband even commented that Olive Garden should offer this on their menu.",
