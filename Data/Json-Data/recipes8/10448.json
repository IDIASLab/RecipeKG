You can serve it hot, but I think it might be better warm or at room temperature, which makes it a nice choice for Thanksgiving when it's hard to have everything ready at the same time. Great for a special holiday dinner or a random weeknight supper.",

As chef John points out, the crumbs don\u2019t adhere too well unless you chop them up finer and really press them in, which I did not. Flavors were amazing though, lemon zest and juice is really nice with the sweet potatoes and I need to experiment with roasting them that way for other applications.",
