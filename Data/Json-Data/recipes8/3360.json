I used a mix of frozen blueberries and strawberries only because I had already packaged them that way for Hubs' smoothies but I have to admit I did like that combination. I simmered them for about 5 minutes in the 1 c. water but didn't add the sugar for the syrup because I was going to use Splenda (I find I don't like its taste once it's heated). I strained everything into my pitcher - the blueberry/strawberry mixture as well as the lemon juice. After adding the water and the Splenda I was pleased to find it a vivid hot pink! I like this. It's different. It's a little too tart but as the ice melts that won't be an issue - if you can wait that long. Interesting I gave some to Hubs who was working out in the yard. His remark was \"It's good! I don't know what it is but it's good!\"",
