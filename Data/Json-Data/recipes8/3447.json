I make a few changes like adding chocolate protien powder instead of flour (as suggested by another user)and omitting the brown sugar and oil. if you use protien powder it will sweeten the bars without the additional sugar. I use dried cherries for the fruit and a little more applesauce to compensate for the lack of oil. They hold together really nicely, even when I throw them in my bookbag for a snack between classes. Tasty brain food. ",

                "reviewBody": "I've made these several times over the past two weeks and have really enjoyed being able to swap out the major flavor makers. The first batch was by the recipe using dried cranberries for the fruit and sliced almonds for the nuts. I added in a little coconut and left out the sunflower seeds b/c I didn't have any. They came out good - but these are VERY HIGH FIBER! Just so you know!  My husband didn't care for the flavor of the first batch. He requested a second which I just made with: pumpkin seeds, dried goji berries, ground flax seeds(in place of 1/2 of the flour), a little coconut and a handful of whole almonds. There wasn't enough crunch in the first batch for him - so these are perfect. I almost doubled the cinnamon too since there are a lot of flavors going on and I think it goes nicely with the nuttiness of the flax. I made a batch with chocolate chips and coconut (coconut oil in place of vegetable) for my 5 & 3 year old with great success - next time I'll leave out the cinnamon with that one though. I also made a tropical version for me with dried papaya, pineapple and coconut. Thank you for a great basic recipe that is SO quick, easy and healthful. Play around to make it suit your taste and health needs!",

This is an easily adaptable recipe. I've used all kinds of fruit purees instead of apple sauce. Some favourite combinations are cherry/ coconut/ white choc chip (just a few for fun!) and pumpkin puree with pumpkin seeds and pumpkin pie spices. We are a nut free home and school so I've tried lots of things to \"fill\" out the bar including flax and all kinds of other seeds soy nuts Grape Nuts bran buds coconut you name it. Almost everything has worked! I double the recipe and use a parchment lined 9 x 13 pan then after it's baked and cooled for about 10 minutes I flip the whole thing out and cut into bars. I let those cool a little longer then wrap them individually so they are ready to go into lunches or as snacks. I get about 18 -24 bars this way.",
