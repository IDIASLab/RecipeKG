My husband likes it with blueberries and I like strawberries, so often I make half with blueberries and half with strawberries. Also, make sure the crust is cooled completely, otherwise the filling will kind of \"melt\". There weren't any recipes anything like this on the site when I first submitted it, I see a couple now. Funny thing is, I submitted it in 2008 (yes, 2008!) and it JUST got published now in January 2015. So technically, mine was first, lol ;) Hope you enjoy!",
