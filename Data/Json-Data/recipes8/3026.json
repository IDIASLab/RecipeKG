The technique to crisp the corn tortillas was new to me, too, making this entirely worthwhile. Next time, I may add some fresh yellow corn, like a single cob's worth to change and sweeten the flavor profile. I craved a cool salsa, something with avocado will be added next time. These I just wolfed down once they cooled and my husband and I kept saying, \"Yummy!\" and that's our test. We will make again especially when in Mexico because these are easy to buy and CHEAP!",
