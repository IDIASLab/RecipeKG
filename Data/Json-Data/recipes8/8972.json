Since we usually have between 10 and 16 people for Thanksgiving, we use a turkey that is at least 25 lbs - even with the larger turkey you can't go wrong with this recipe!  You do need to check it before the end of the cooking time listed, some ovens tend to cook faster than others (like mine!) so you want to make sure you don't over-cook it.  And definitely make sure you flour your bag before putting the turkey in.  The drippings make an awesome gravy and has been a HUGE hit, one of our guests hates gravy, but when I make this turkey and the subsequent gravy, he can't get enough!  I'm looking forward to making this again this year, we're having more guests this year than the last 2, and they're looking forward to having this awesome turkey! :)",

Had a bit of trouble figuring out how to remove the neck (was reaching for the hammer when my boyfriend took over), but prepping the bird couldn't have been easier. Season it, squish some butter under the skin and then pour champagne on, in and under the bird's skin, tie close the bag and toss it in the oven. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to cook my 12-pound bird at 275 for 2.5 hours, removing it from the bag and then returning to the oven for another 45mins to brown the skin. Let it sit for another 20 mins before carving and it was amazing. Everyone raved about how moist and delicious it was. Thanks Sarah for the great recipe!",

I forgot to read those instructions and you need to add flour to the bottom of the bag so it doesn't burst.  I found that out later on and ended up switching bags before I put the turkey in the oven.  The turkey was very moist and I added some chicken boulleon to the broth after it was done cooking so I could make gravy that tasted less sweet.  I highly recommend this recipe, or the homestyle turkey- michagander way on this website.  I've only made 2 turkeys in my life and these turned out better than ones family members have made for years (shh don't tell)\r\n\r\nGood luck!",

FOR THE USERS THAT KEEP ASKING : Yes make sure you cut slits in the roasting bag and make sure you flour the bag too or the skin will stick. My turkey was completly wiped off the table and there were only six of us! All gone...I also used the drippings and sauce for gravy and I used the gravy recipe from \"Easy Turkey Gravy\" and they both combined excellent! This was the first time i made turkey and now I have enough confidence to make Thanksgiving Dinner. TIP: FIRST MAKE THE TURKEY BREAST SIDE DOWN AND IT WILL BE REALLY JUICY. I flipped it back up to the other side the last hour and removed the bag so it could brown. I basted it with melted butter every 20 minutes until it was ready. If you are making your first turkey this is the recipe for you. Thank you for posting this recipe!!!!!!!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was ok. I had an 11.8 lb turkey and I only needed to cook it for about 2 hours. I even turned down the oven to 325. I ended up leaving it in for a bout 2.5 hours so I think it over cooked a bit which may have been why mine wasn't as juicy as others mentioned. Overall it was good and the champagne and drippings made a good gravy but I couldn't give this one 5 stars because the flavor was about average and the cooking time was too high and long.",
