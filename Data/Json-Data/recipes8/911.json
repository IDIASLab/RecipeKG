You'll need a blender, mesh strainer, and two large pots. If you're cooking for fewer, cut the recipe in half. Top with seasoned croutons, crackers, pumpkin seeds, or feta cheese. The kids like to add Goldfish\u00ae crackers. You can be fancy and garnish with basil leaves also.",

I halved the recipe and there's no way there was 8 servings - more like 4 healthy servings, 6 at best, so plan accordingly. The amount of salt seems excessive, but it all turns out great! I would have preferred a thicker soup, so next time I would either reduce the soup down before straining, or not strain it at all (or maybe only strain half).   I ended up adding more cream than called for which gave better flavor and creaminess.",
